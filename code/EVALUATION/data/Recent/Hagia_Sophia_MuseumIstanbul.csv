Excellent place ,It is now Masjid museum has been finished. Prayer is offered five times a day. No match to such a beautiful place.
Great ,"17:59 .il 4G II Reviews from tanerisiTurkey Hagia Sophia, Architectural Maintenance, Basilica Plan with Central Plan Combines, domed basilica Type in a building whether the dome Crossing and Suspension System Features with Treated Significant Milestones in the History of Architecture  .  Hagia Sophia is Important First of all with its Dimensional and Architectural Structure.  In the World of the Period in which it was built, no Basilica Plan Building was Covered with a Dome the Size of the Dome of Hagia Sophia and did not have such a large place.  Although the Dome of Hagia Sophia is Smaller than the Dome of the Pantheon in Rome, the Mixed and Sophisticated System Consisting of Half Dome, Arches and Vaults applied in Hagia Sophia Makes the Dome More Impressive by Providing a Much More Spatial Pattern of the Dome.  When Compared to the Domes of the Previous Buildings Built on the Body Walls as a Carrier, Such a Large Dome Fitted on Only Four Stages is considered a Revolution in the History of Architecture both in terms of Technical and Aesthetics.  The Main (Central) Dome, which covers half of the middle nave, has been expanded so that it creates a very large rectangular interior space with half domes attached to its east and west, that when viewed from the ground, it is perceived as a dome dominating the entire interior.  The System Was Completed By Transitioning From Half Domes That Cover The East And West Openings To Smaller Half-Domed Exedras.  This Hierarchy of Domes, Starting from Small Domes and Completed with the Crown of the Main Dome, is an Architectural System Unprecedented in Ancient Times.  The Basilica Plan of the Building Is Ingeniously Completely ""Hidden"".  Ye Dome Inscribed During Construction"
soo big and feeling good like magic!,the must beautyfull think i think! I like . But turkish people are soo friendly and happy! I feeling like my home..
Absolutely breathtaking ,To walk between Sultan Ahmet and Hagia Sofia during the noon call to prayer was one of the most awe inspiring moments of my life. It literally brought me to tears walking through the doors of Hagia Sofia and then to have my children Stand by me as we prayed the noon prayer was something we will never forget. You felt the history of the building surround you. The cleanliness is a whole other amazing aspect. The detail and care by the government is absolutely inspiring. A must for any muslim or non muslim coming to Turkey.
Amazing experience,"Amazing experience! As archaeologist myself, I had a deep and profound appreciation for Hagia Sophia, for its history and meaning to both christian and muslim heritage....really a must visit!"
Great ! ,"Istanbul's magnificent cathedral was a major religious site in Christianity and Islam, but it had also become a museum ... it’s very interesting & beautiful architecture to see."
Bucket list,Absolutely awesome    did it in history at school  had to wait 40 years to see it.Don't wait so long!!!
Quite an impressive piece of architecture,"For our bad luck, Hagia Sophia was being renovated when we visited, but it was still open. Eyes can’t soak in all of the beauty of the architecture of the this gorgeous building"
Breath taking,"Probably the nicest mosque I have ever seen in my life, you sense peace within. You can pray there inside."
Disappointed,The queues were long. The Museum was under construction and honestly it was not worth the money we spent.
Stunningly beautiful ,"Felt so peaceful when you enter. Architecture is stunning. Stayed during afternoon prayers which gave me goosebumps, wonderfully serene atmosphere. Be warned though there is restoration work so parts are closed off."
Hands down the most Beautiful Inside ever!,"Mrs and I visited this mosque on a Sunday around 3pm, it was fairly busy but the inside was absolutely stunning.Overall this was my favourite mosque out of the 6/7 mosques I visited during my stay in Istanbul. Make sure not to go during prayer times as the mosque will remain shut to tourists during those times of the day."
Nice to visit ,Unfortunately I didn’t have lots of time to see as much as I wanted to but I had a quick tour inside which was very impressive. It was free to enter.
Sofia,A wonderful place! 😳 It's been a part of Istanbul for centuries now 🕌🕌 and it's still an impressive place to visit 🕌🕌
Amazing Hagia Sophia visit,As Hagia Sophia is not a museum anymore and it’s a mosque now. The experience was quite good and amazing as the history surrounds all around you. Wearing a mask is a must for everyone entering the premises and security measures were quite good.
Truly grand and majestic!,"Historical achitecture doesn't come more grand and spectacular than this. Every part, every pillar and every corner of this colossal building speaks of years of struggle, centuries of preservation and 1000+ years of history. Its been recently reinstated as a mosque and our visit was on Friday, just after the Juma prayers, so it gave an even better feeling and an overwhelming experience overall."
Reviving,"I was able to attend a prayer there, an amazing place.  They were well organised and had very strict social distancing with all the equipments available."
September 2020,"wonderful time in Turkey, a definite must while in Istanbul. Wear comfortable shoes, and bring a good camera."
MUST SEE,"Honestly, one of the most breathtaking places I had the pleasure of visiting! It is also free to visit this place and was absolutely worth standing in a queue for"
Camii,Loved the atmosphere different feeling from a museum to camii The style is really protected the old history and new one
History centre,"Nice, interesting From outside real old ages building in amazing Istanbul!Very nice around relax area in front Sophia."
Very grand! Çok büyük!,Dim inside at night but still amazing to know the history and see it's design. Geceleri içeride sönük ama yine de tarihi bilmek ve tasarımını görmek harika.
TA should change the heading - it's not a museum any more,"This was my 6th time in Istanbul, and during every of these travels I've visited Hagia Sophia, as I regard it as one of world's most famous and important edifices. This time it was a different experience.Hagia Sophia is an iconic world heritage edifice, built on orders of Emperor Justinian. It still holds the world record being built in only 5 years (532-537). It was the main and biggest Christian Church where many kings were crowned for almost a millennium, until the Ottomans came in 15c converting it into a Mosque.During the times of Ataturk reformations it was established as a museum in 1935 - and it was one of the world's best. My memories root in that period, when you had to queue in a long line outside, paying around 10 Euros entry fee and when you could admire outstanding frescoes and mosaics from 6th c onwards, along with Ottoman decorations added from 15c. It was a unique place in entire world (along with some Churches in Andalusia) where you could admire such a cultural and religious mix.This was until this year, when it was reestablished as a Mosque again in July. While the imposing exterior remained the same, the interior is much different. You cannot walk the multi centuries stone and marble floor, as it's completely covered with a green carpet (you must take off your shoes before entering). All amazing Byzantine frescoes and mosaics are covered in white sheets and you cannot see them, nor you can climb the upper gallery where there're more. Therefore I give 4 stars, otherwise I'd give 100.Now, there's no entry fee, you can walk in freely (except during prayer times), but I wish I still had to pay and see all these now hidden jewels I remember Hagia Sophia for.I enclose pics from my previous visit in 2012 and now, 2020 - catch the differences."
Now more peaceful than ever.,"Indeed, a must see. A timeless place of workship in all its glory. free entrance, amongst many historical sites. Priceless for free.."
Beautiful Mosque but Christian icons are now inaccessible,This is a beautiful mosque and well worth a visit but the Christian icons are now covered up which was disappointing. 2nd floor is not accessible now
FANTASTIC.,"FANTASTIC. Istanbul  and  all  mosgues , Churchs and other places  are magnificent. Istanbul is that built on two continent.Asia and europe.  Istanbul  is  my  dream."
Smells history! ,"You can see the influence of different religions and rulers at this place! As Hagia Sphia is tured to a mosque, the floor is covered by a big carpet made of head ducks! That's why you can't see the floor anymore!"
Dissapointing,Very little to see as the place is going through renovations.  They make you cover your legs and head. They provide if you don’t have it.
Blah,Turn it back into a museum. Changed back again into a mosque. History being rewritten in stone. Scraped off Byzantine Icons.
It was worth a lifetime,Hagia Sophia is an awesome experience. The architecture and the beauty is enthralling. A must visit when in Istanbul
Not sure..,"I had heard so many amazing things about this 'giant' of history...I understand that it is now a functioning Mosque. Saying that, was covering the floor in a less than hygienic carpet during Covid 19 sensible? Surely bringing your own prayer matt would be safer/more hygienic aswell as more photogenic..."
Amazing ,Beautiful place breathtaking lots of history free to see inside take a scarf ladies when you enter the museum nice gardens outside to see
Not so good since it has become a mosque,"I have been to the Hagia Sophia many, many times over the last 25 years. Until recently is was a museum, however in the last month or so it has become a mosque again. Although visitors are allowed in, the floor is now carpeted (which massively reduces the acoustics. The scaffolding tower is still there (was 25 years ago).  Not as awe-inspiring as it used to be tbh."
A huge disappointment,"The Hagia Sophia is no longer a museum. Since July 2020, it is now a mosque. It is also, currently (Sep 2020)  a building site. It is not possible to see the beautiful interior space that you see in photographs. It has a hideous carpet throughout so you can't even see the floor. It has been stripped of any images that do not fit with it being a mosque. It was not even possible to see the Byzantine mosaics that remain. These were off limits to visitors with a guard blocking the entrance to them. A huge disappointment."
Good service ,Thank you so much for the amazing trip and wonderful moments. We really enjoyed our holidays. Looking forward to some more memorable trip. 😊
Amazing,"The age of this building build quality i was amazed looking at it how it would have been built without today,s tech would recomend to any one to visit this building"
Incredible,"Incredible Hagia Sofia.. amazing structure, you felt at peace once you step in. The beauty inside is mesmerising"
A place you won’t forget,It’s a one of those places you won’t forget you visited because of its rich work. The paintings on the walls are so beautiful and spiritual.
Historic Mosque,"unfortunately, so many people is not wearing mask and no social distancing here.. so I can not enjoy to see this mosque"
Delightfull,A lovely museum. Very interesting place to visit. Not a lot of children seen more for adults or older students.
Totally amazing - A must do.,"This was my favorite place whilst visiting Istanbul.When we visited in March, there was no Covid 19 restrictions  in place.The building is an amazing structure with arches built upon arches built upon arches to keep it upright due to the weight of the first dome.It has so much history and is stunningly beautiful.This had restorations going on and there was scaffolding blocking some of the amazing interior.We visited while it was still a museum. The christian aspects of the museum where still in view. I think this has changed now due to it being changed back to a functioning mosque. We wandered around for nearly two hours just amazed at the scale and beauty of the place.It was truly wonderful. A must visit when in Istanbul.As its changed to a mosque, its still accessible but you will need to be mindful of going outside of prayer times."
Awe-inspiring,"If you can't find your own level of spirituality HERE, i'm not sure one can. It was amazing. One of the greatest feats of human engineering. Holiest place in the Eastern Christian Empire. Awe-inspiring and an honor to be given this experience. As a student of history, it was hard not to think of the masses who sought refuge here in 1453, to no avail. A visit to this amazing city cannot be complete without paying homage to the Aya Sofia."
Wonderful place,This is really one of the nice place in istanbul in the best area in front of sultan ahmat recommend to see it
The most important in Istanbul ,This mosque is the most important thing in Istanbul you can do and visit any day and know you can pray alsoThis is the best thing
Nice place to see in istanbul,Dont forget to go to hagia sophia if u are in istanbul one of the good places to visit  me and my kids went there many time now wase free and open 24 h
Stunning size and structure,"This building is 56m high, amazing architectural achievement for the times it was build. Very impressive,"
Stunning amazing breath taking,Beautiful stunning peaceful. Spiritual. Filled with character. Huge building  can spend hours hereOpen 24 hours
"Amazing, now open 24/7","Loved it, visited at midnight was one of the only people in the place. No fee to enter now as it is now a mosque."
What a place full with history ,You must see the Architectural ingenuity is phenomenal. And when you walk into the main hall you can feel the peace and  tranquillity of this  historical place.
Happy to experience Ayasofya as a mosque and as a museum,The mosque is obv. free of charge where you can make your prayers and experience the history behind it. Recommend everyone who visits Istanbul
"Go early to avoid ques 
We waited 25minutes 
Was well worth the wait.",An amazing atmosphere Love the history thd city holds.Haga Sofia a must visit Opposite is blue mosque and plenty to eat
Not a musuem any more :( ,So expecting a museum we entered a mosque instead and it was Friday and man i do not recommend going there in friday. The most crowded day for people who come to pray. We really couldnt see much as a respect we left...
Good experience,"amazing experience to be honest. People are praying and experiencing the history at once. Didnt wait in line, was free of charge"
Stunning history,"What a beautiful place, just incredible. To be amongst this history is awesome. A must if you're in Istanbul"
Amazing Place,"You have to visit AyaSofia, when you visit Istanbul.  An amazing place.  full of history                                                                                    .                                                   .................................................................                     ."
Hagia/ Ayah Sofia mosque.,"It was an amazing experience. We went in the evening as it can get crowded or closed after prayers for cleaning. It is so grad and very special. Now that it’s back to being a mosque it is an experience not to be missed. Full of history, from the 6th Century, I wanted to check every space, nook and cranny, but again as some refurbishing work is taking place you only see the main area. Women have their own prayer section which overlooks the men’s section. In the evening and certain times in the day, you’re free to visit both. They sometimes offer women blue scarves to cover modestly, otherwise do bring your own. I visited it several times and couldn’t get enough. A must see. Have to keep mask on at all times and take shoes off at entrance."
Church of Holy Wisdom,"Hagia Sophia means, Holy Wisdom and it was built at 6th century with the order of emperor Justinian by the Architects Isidorus of Miletos and Anthiemus of Tralles. It is the third church built in the same area and served as a cathedral for about 900 hundred years from 6th until to 15 the century. In 1453 after Ottomans conquered Constantinople it was converted to a mosque and served as a mosque for about 480 years until 1935. In 1935 it was converted to museum with the decision of the president and founder of Turkish Republic Atatürk and served as a museum for 85 years until July 2020. Then was converted back to mosque in July 2020 and serving as a mosque so it is possible to visit it after prayers but unfortunately not possible to see amazing Byzintine mosaics couse these mosaics were covered with curtains couse it's against Islam. So Hagia Sophia is an great work of Architecture, result of amazing mathmetical and engineering knowledge of Romans, a very important inspiration for the world, a revolution in the architecture!"
A wonderful place,It’s amazing when you read about it in history books but once you see it you remain breathless. You just have to see it. Too bad they’ve turned it into an active mosque and some of the walls are covered to conceal Christian symbols. But biggest bugger is that you can’t see the floors anymore but a few square meters as there’s carpet on it. Anyway. Still worth a visit.
3 Day Private Guided Tour,Highly recommend a visit. Early morning before larger tour groups is recommended. Suggest a private guide to explain all the beauty of the site and the important history that is part of the Hagia Sophia Museum
First Prayers here ,I’ve been to Aya Sofia twice previously and today was the first time for Friday Prayers. Absolutely breathtaking architecture and Friday prayers!
Nice,Amazing place... I love Istanbul... I will come again with my family. Cause ı wanna show them too this beautiful city
a bit dark and lack freshness,"its historical, recently converted to Mosque so lot of people wants to get in, queuing system was in place in early August 2020. Majestic inside but little suffocating and lack openness, less lighting."
Absolutely Mesmerizing Visit,This was a true highlight to visit considering its significance and millennium-long existence (though it has been rebuilt more than once!). A true temple of the gods
A bit disappointing!!,"Unfortunately the place is undergoing restoration - it used to be a museum before and it's being transformed to a mosque. Most of the frescoes and paintings are covered, is a shame! Could have been better visiting this place couple of months back...."
Amazing mosque and very original nothing has changed ,Just amazing. You must visit this place for true historical value.The turks are meticulous in their preservation of history
A must see.,Read our first prayers here after arriving in Istanbul. What an amazing place and great energy. At the moment still a museum.
Immense piece of architecture,"Once you step inside you quickly realise why this was once the largest christian cathedral in the world. Amazing, just the sheer size of the structure. The vast interior the huge entrance doors the mosaics on the walls. Truly a must see"
Step back in time,Beautiful historic gem located by the blue mosque. The architecture is marvellous and the place has a serenely peaceful feeling. At themoment be ready to queue up if you want to go in and you will need to go through security checks also. I waited over an hour to get in but it was well worth it.
The most iconic building ,Definitely a place to see day and night time. Great architecture inside the building. Most busy place for pictures from 12 till 6 pm. Best time is always till 10 am.
Out of this world.  A must.  Take a guide to learn about the history.  Go early.,"Stunning.  The architecture, history and detail is just out of this world.  Dress modestly and make sure your head is covered.  Go early to avoid the crowds and appreciate the beauty.  Suggest taking a guide.  This was my fourth visit but my first time with a guide and I learnt so much."
Disappointed,Disappointed. We had to wait an hour in the heat to go in. Once in all the Christian icons were covered up and area you can see is limited.
"Beautiful mosque, amazing prayer time experience","Beautiful mosque (converted from museum). Very busy and full of tourists. Organised when clearing visitors out prior to prayer times so people can worship. There are social distancing measures during prayers, police also guarding outside and letting people in batches.We attended here a few time’s and actually in the middle of the night it is near empty and best time to take in the beautiful interior and enjoy time there. Jummah prayer is very busy here. We arrived over 1 hour before prayer time and still only managed to get a praying space outdoors in Sultanhamet park."
A true wonder,"No words could describe the awe felt when you’re inside, taking in all of its glory & staring at those beautiful mosaics!"
"Once a museum, again a mosque","First time inside Hagia Sophia after it became a mosque. Easy access, no entrance fee, very peaceful. Floor covered in carpet inside prayer hall."
A breath-taking site ,"The Mosque, now museum, is simply monumental when observed from the outside and breath-taking on the inside.Really a pity that many parts of it are closed for years for renovating but still a must-visit.Could be combined with a visit to the Basilica Cistern and a visit to the Mesopotamian Terrace Restaurant (photo from the Restaurant)."
Beautiful,"Big and magnificent from outside. Inside was quite a bit under construction to get a better impression, so I suggest you wait a bit before visiting."
Must Visit!... Wonder of the World! ,"Once you walk in, you feel like you have gone back in time. The architecture and the Islamic arts around the whole place is amazing. Makes you wonder how on earth did they build this place. Hagia Sophia is the 10th Wonder of the World for a reason! and must be visited if your in Turkey."
Best MUSEUM around ,I think the economy is more important than the conversion of a building from 1453. But this is just an opinion
Must visit,Hagia Sophia is a must visit attraction in Istanbul. Impressive mosque which previously was a church with rich history. you can enjoy the Islamic calligraphy and the hitorical designs.
You must see,"You can't go to Istanbul and not not see this place! From Venetian Doge Enrico Dandalo to Viking runes from Roman architecture to Ottoman adjustments, this place is amazing!"
Great history,"İ love history so much,Ayasofia museum 1 of the best in history in the word,when you enter it can not bliave is 1600 years old still in do good condision,highy recoment"
Totally amazing to see AyaSofya ,I don’t know how do rally describe this visit. We were there maybe 2 weeks after it officially reopened as a mosque again. It was just really beautiful..... both from the outside and inside.
Under construction ,"Amazing mosque. Beautiful architecture. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 the queues were massive and a long wait (Saturday night) so we turned back. However, Sunday morning was much better as there weren't as many people. A part of the inside is under construction so you won't get the full effect but still an amazing place to visit :)"
Impressive but too hectic ,The building is lovely and blows you away. But I can only say from my experience that the disorganisation lets you down a little. Be careful of going at prayer times. Also somewhat rushed out! As a monument just beautiful though
Amazing ,This is a seriously impressive mosque. Photographers delight. Don't miss the two massive jars at the back and take in the size of the doors!
Not What it Used to Be,"While still worth visiting, I was very disappointed to see that all the historic mosaics were covered up and the second floor and other areas are now off-limits. I'd say the Hagia Sophia is a shell of its former self, nothing like the pictures you see online. On the plus side, it is free now..."
First visit to Istanbul,"Amazing place to visit, ensure you do not visit on praying days as it is dammed, worth getting a guide for 150tl"
Amazing Building Hagia Sophia,Very Huge and a structure that smells of history. We could see from outside because of reconstruction inside.It is located opposite of Blue Mosque and beside Topkapi Palace. Must visit definitly.
Wow...just wow!,"This place is amazing! I'd always wanted to go when I'd see the pictures, but pictures don't do it justice. It's very awe-inspiring and I can see how the Russians thought this place was heavenly, all those centuries ago."
Open to visitors,Contrary to current information Hagia Sofia is re-openend to visitors since transformation to a mosque. Entrance is for free and no tickets needed. Just try to avoid visiting at praying times - as masses flow into Hagia Sofia and during prayers men and women are separated into different sectors.
Hagia Sophia Mosque: Ayasofya Cami,"The Hagia Sophia needs no introductions, especially in light of the recent news coverage. I was especially lucky to have attended the re-opening of the mosque, in light of the judgment of the Council of State. I have since attended numerous prayers at the mosque. It is absolutely beautiful, and Mehmet II and the great architect Mimar Sinan have really reglorified the Ayasofya!Highly recommended- for all faiths!"
Business visit,"Very good excellent stay , enjoyed every moment,  will definitely come again and will definitely lately reccomend  it to our friends and family , we are looking forward to coming back , and have made White House hotel our favourite place,  now we will come to Turkey just because of White House Hotel , the rooms were excellent and the hotel was beautiful,  amazing decor and history , in beautiful  condition,  friendly staff who look after you and go out of there way to help you."
Now instead of marble floors you have an ugly green carpet you'd find in a mall,They have covered most of the Christian ornaments when they converted it to a mosque and it has lost its grandeur. Allegedly they will display them outside of prayer hours.
Story teller place ,"Such an nice place to be there, it says lot of stories through the past, i would highly recommend to visit it"
Masterpiece,"Due to conversion back into Mosque the Hagia Sofia is closed. The whole area is under heavy police security, however this majestic masterpiece is still a wonderful example of Christian Architecture to ponder over.The original building was destroyed and rebuilt, so this is the third structure. The dome and minaret were added by the Ottoman empire."
Amazing Hagia Sophia,"Visited Turkey in early March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  At that time, the virus had not spread to Turkey yet so there was no screening or mask requirements.This was my second time in Turkey and one of the highlights of the trip was the Hagia Sophia.  Words alone cannot convey the feeling of this enormous monument.  Purchased the Istanbul Tourist Pass and the Hagia Sophia was one of the attractions that was included, so no additional ticket fee when visiting.  The short tour was conducted by trained Big Bus staff and lasted about 30 minutes.  Afterwards we were free to explore the rest of the Hagia Sophia, staying as long as we wanted.If you visit in the morning, you may experience beautiful rays of sunlight shining through the exquisite stained glass windows.  The beams lighting up the floor made for great photos.   Note: tripods or selfie sticks of any kind or size are not allowed inside and will be held at security for you until you exit.Enjoy your visit!"
Is there a single place in the world with so much history?!,"While the museum was closed because it had just become a mosque the previous week, I could feel the holiness of the ground on which I stood before it."
Worth to visit when in Istanbul,"Historical place and located just next to Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet area. I paid around 100 Lira for the entrance fee, but this Hagia Sophia is worth to visit. You will know the story of its existence. It was a church turned to a mosque. Come and experience the paintings and the story behind it."
1500 years jewel,"nothing like diving back 1500 years ,beautiful structure and christian are wall designs,must visit in a lifetime"
1500 year old crown jewel,"Former Greek orthodox christian patriarchal  cathedral ,converted into ottoman mosque,now museum  ,1500 year old crown jewel is most visited place in turkey,buy pass to avoid long line"
Underwhelming Experience,"Although this is rated as one of the best attractions to visit in Istanbul, I was very underwhelmed by the Hagia Sophia. The history of the building changing between religions is interesting, however the upkeep of the building is not the best. The architecture on the outside is impressive but it is very dark and gloomy on the inside. If you are looking for beautiful interiors, I recommend going to some of the other mosques in Istanbul such as the Suleymaniye Mosque which is incredible."
Cultural Wonder,"Hagia sophia is the one of the museum that I know, Church and Mosque together. You can feel both of religion in one place. Must see, Must feel..."
"Beautiful Mosque, Terrible Service","The workers at this mosque were downright rude. They questioned my daughter's age and had no respect for her as a young girl. Even when she was crying begging them to believe her age they did not budge. Simply because she looks older did not give them a reason to charge her an adult fee when she clearly fits the children fee. The mosque however is beautiful, one of the most amazing I have seen. The architecture is incredible and truly embodies the Turkish look. If the service were to be improved, this place could be incredible."
"İt is a Mosque, not a Church and not a Museum..",İ think all Religions can be pray in this Mosque. Normally without Covid per day 15.000 tourists visit the Mosque
Good,Great church in İstanbul when we arrive istanbul for sure we ara visitting ticket Price was little expesive This year
Beat church on the word !,It was great church when we come to istanbul every we come we are visiting here when we go inside we are getting relax :)
ST. SOPHIA MUSEUM,"Ayasofya or Saint Sophia church, now a museum, is an unique place to visit in Istanbul. The mosaics are wonderful."
great,it was really perfect time we went to there with our guide really amazing i hope we will come back there !
A beautiful structure.,Amazing Church turned Mosque turned Museum. A must see when in Istanbul even if just from the outside!
Beautiful place around,"As we visited in March 2020, so we did not visit the museums from inside due to precautions, but the area around the museum, the mosque and sultan overall is very picturesque and serene. A must visit !!!"
Special place ❤️,"Hagia Sophia is the one of the most beautiful places in the world. Not just because of how it's look like, but because of the way you feel while you are there. Stunning. Definitely, ""must see"" place if you are in Istanbul."
The scale is incredible,This museum has an outstanding history and is truly a sight to see. Pay the fee to enter whether or not you decide on the guided tour.
Historical Wonder,"This has been on my bucket list for years and it didn't disappoint at all. Even though this is one of the most popular sites to visit and it can be quite busy with tourist, you have to visit it. The history alone in this building is amazing besides just the beauty. You have to see this no matter what!"
Crown Jewel of Istanbul,"The museum was once operated as a church during the reign of Byzantine Empire and then converted into a masjid during the reign of Ottoman Empire. Nowadays, Hagia Sophia is operated as a museum.We can see the exquisite painting of baby Jesus and The Virgin Mary alongside calligraphy of Allah (God) and Mohammed (may peace be upon him) at the main hall.There are aslo calligraphy of the names of first 4 calliphs during Islamic calliphate reign at the same main hall.There was renovation works during our visit so the view inside Hagia Sophia was obstructed by scaffoldings and curtains.The museum located right across of The Blue Mosque and within walking distance from Topkapi Pallace."
Hagia Sophia in January,"We were able to visit Istanbul in January, which meant the crowds were much less than in the summer. This meant we did not have to stand for long in the line up for tickets, which was really nice. We were able to walk in and see this beautiful building without having to struggle through the crowds. Because of the lack of crowds we could take as much time as we needed to walk through the building and enjoy just being there.It was a wonderful visit, and we would recommend everyone to see this wonderful monument."
Wonderful,"I was in Istanbul in February, one the must-see place is, of course, the Hagia Sophia.Since it was a little cold, there wasn't much queue at the entrance. Normally we expected to wait around min 30 min.Its a wonderful place to visit, one of the most beatiful buildings in the World"
Pure History,"Once a church, once a mosque and now a great museum, Hagia Sophia is a historic and awsome building, once the biggest of all Europe, that must be visited when you are in Istanbul"
Captivating!!,"The Hagia Sophia Museum is a mesmerizing piece of historical architecture with an enchanting mix of Christian and Muslim religious symbols, relics and art. Being a history student, I would place this monument high up there. Amazing rich history - Built in the 6th century (by the Byzantine emperor Justinina I) to be a Greek Orthodox Christian patriarchal cathedral and functioned that way for 900+ years. Later, in 15th century,  under the Ottoman empire, transitioned into an imperial mosque and functioned that way for c. 400+ yrs. And now a museum. Amazing ! How historical can a monument be !! When walking inside this monument, one can't help wishing for a time machine, that can take you back in the times when this monument was under construction, used for religious events, etc.  On a trip to Istanbul, this is a highly recommended monument to visit."
Inspiring,I did not know anything about this museum before we went. To say i was blown away is an understatement. I truly love how different religions share the same space in happiness. Inspiring is not  a strong enough word. Is defiantly a must
"Stunning, Majestic , Mystical","7 years ago , I was watching a German / French TV channel called ARTE.,  a documentary about Istanbul. I love architecture from the Cathedral  de St. Denis, the skyscrapers old and new, of my native New York City, the palaces of Florence, anything done by my favorite , Zaha Hadid. But when I saw this edifice, I thought, ' It is essential that I go to Istanbul and see this .'' This is in a category above all others. A beauty of design that reaches into your soul and requires one to whisper,or be silent while observing it. 6 times have I gone to Istanbul and 3 times , I have visited the Hagia Sophia. It is a symbol of what Humans can do when they are striving to do their best. No matter what religion one belongs to or not, the Aya Sofya is put you in a trance and you will be a different,  more peaceful person when you leave. Carolyn O."
Legendary place ,"Guys the Hagia Sophia you must see that place on earth, I don't know on earth historical place more than this place"
"Easy to navigate, yet easy to lose yourself in","Beautiful historical piece of architecture, with a fascinating mix of Christian and Muslim religious symbols and art."
Best guide in Istanbul,"I visited Istanbul with my elderly mother over the summer and had an absolutely amazing experience, thanks entirely to our guide Ender Pinarbasi. In addition to being comfortably fluent in almost every language you can think of, his knowledge of Istanbul is unmatched. His ability to leverage his connections in the community to give his customers a once in a lifetime experience. He will make you feel like a true local, giving you the inside track not only on the big ticket tourist items but also on the off-the-beaten-track restaurants, spice vendors, carpet shops, and any other shopping, cultural or historical experience you can imagine. Spend the day with Ender you’ll have one of the best days of your life and a great friend too."
Awe-Inspiring,"Incredible, wonderful, and gorgeous. It is shockingly massive. You will be totally astonished. I suggest coming with a guide as there is so much history to it."
Amazing History,A must visit if you are visiting Istanbul. A very historic site and very well maintained. The museum depicts the different era's that Istanbul has been through and is a very significant symbol in the Istanbul skyline.
cool place to visit!,"Hagia Sophia is the former Greek Orthodox Christian patriarchal cathedral, later an Ottoman imperial mosque and now a museum in Istanbul, Turkey. Built-in AD 537 in the Late Antiquity, it is famous for its massive dome. It was the world's largest building and an engineering marvel of its time"
Beautiful place,It is usually partly under renovation but regardless is still very beautiful. I have been there many times and still will go again.
Great,"Fantastic place, very beautiful even though half of it is under reconstruction. Ticket is 100 TL, guide is 50 TL extra if you need one"
Hagia Sophia,Hagia Sophia is a historical and cultural center and architectural monument of the first Byzantine Empire and then the Ottoman Empire. Now it is a state Museum that attracts many visitors every year. This place is definitely worth a visit.
Astonishing beauty,One appreciates these buildings when visited especially when you learn about the history of both people and building.
Beautiful,"Lovely visit to Hagia Sophia. 100TL entry fee payable at the gate. We spent no more than 1 hour here. Lovely architecture and an interesting mesh of Christian and Muslim art/ design. Half of it was under renovations with a large scaffold to the side which meant its beauty was impaired somewhat, but good to see they are keeping it safe and updated. Make sure to walk up to the upper gallery via the winding stone walkway. Nice coffee shop on the grounds too."
Beautiful place,"Beautiful sights and architecture. I'd highly recommend travellers to visit this mosque. It's near topkapi palace and blue mosque so tourists can visit all three places together. I personally liked hania Sofia more than blue mosque, probably because blue mosque has been under construction for the longest time."
Sunday walk...,Very magnificent building and historical fundamentals. I would recommend everyone to see this museum..💯
Unbelievably OLD and HUGE,"This monument is an architectural site not to miss. It is now a national site, and not a religious site any more.  Unfortunately when we were there (some of the areas were shrouded by drapery and scaffolding b/c the art work (frescoes?) were being restored). Check with your travel agent to learn if this is still the case.  Ditto for the Blue Mosque."
Architectural wonder but a bit hyped,"You cannot not see Hagia Sophia when in Istanbul. So do pay a visit. But I'd say don't get your expectations too high. It is a brilliant high done, amazing mosaics but that's really it. The history around it is obviously very interesting and do read about it before going for best experience"
This is a must do in Istanbul ,"We went here on a rainy day in March, it costs 100 Turkish Lira to go in (£12.50) and it was worth it. It was a massive mosque but is now a museum, lots of really old mosaics (there’s one that’s from 867 AD, now that’s old. You can also go upstairs & look down, very good"
Must see ... 8th wonder of world,"Being a person who is not into museums so much , visiting Hagia Sophia was a delight. With an amazing history associated with it and the grand opening , high ceilings etc it is a site which helps you imagine that how wonderful and artistic the past was . You get to see Architecture from 6th century which is like 14th centuries ago . The mere mention of this fact raises the level of what we see so much. Trip to Istanbul is incomplete without a visit to Hagia Sophia."
"Beautiful, but undergoing renovation",Lovely outside and in. All the scaffolding inside for restoration work takes away from the experience. It is disappointing that all the major sites in Istanbul seem to have renovations simultaneously.
Hagia Sophia ,What an incredible place - it is so beautiful- inspiring- an worldly The history- the beautiful artwork- You feel so peaceful and that you are in gods Allah’s presence-Stay at the Old Town Istanbul Hostel for a 3 minute walk!
Istanbul,When I arrived to Istanbul.. I decided to visit this place.. in second day from my trip.. in afternoon time..I saw so many people waiting in front door. After I entered I forgot the time.. I recommend it..
Impressive Church / Mosque,"Although there is restoration works inside the Church, it is still very impressive. Beautiful frescos survived from the Church.The building itself is very impressive inside and outside, makes you a wow impression.When we were there, it was not very crowded, but I guess in the season, expect for a lot of people."
Wow,"This is definitely not to miss when visiting Istanbul. A part of it is under reconstruction at the moment, but it is definitely amazing."
Magnificent,I would say this was the most magnificent monument I've seen in Istanbul. I mix of cultures and religions makes of Hagia Sofia a unique place with so much diversity. This is a must visit place to whoever goes to Istanbul.
Undergoing restoration inside,Definitely worth a visit but a large section is undergoing restoration but assume it’s due to being out of season (March) but still impressive inside
Amazing,"Hagia Sofia is a must see when you go to Istanbul, I think there are very few places in the world where you can see a mix of Islam and Christianity, and it’s simply amazing. The building is very important in the history of Istanbul and if you visit it and read about its history you can understand why."
Tour,"Hagia Sophia so beautiful and lovely,I'll never feel tired while walking around the first time I visit there last year 2019 and I went with Tourguide and when he's saying about the story I was amazed.i told myself that I will comeback to see it again and finally I visited again last Feb.2020.I felt so blessed and thankfull..Alhamdulillah 😍❤️❤️"
do not get audio!,"having visted Spain's sagrada familiar and used their audio guide, the one at the HS was diabolical at best.Not only did it start with 101( not sure where the other 100 parts went) but each point lasted 30s before you had to decipher on the map where to go next.There was no structure or theme to the entire audio, which you had to type for the part of the guide.Info on the guide included 'this is a marble door', no real information learnt.Was tempted to go outside and hire my own guide having paid 100Lira for the privilege.If anyone from the HS is listening,please base your audio guide on Spain's SF, and burn the Huwai phone."
An amazing place with layers of history,"The Hagia Sophia is at the cross roads of East and West, Islam and Christianity.  There are layers upon layers of unbelievable stories and incredible beauty.  From 11th century Viking graffiti to priceless mosaics to the largest Islamic calligraphy in the world, this place is absolutely unique."
Beautiful well worth a visit,"This stunning, originally Christian Church, then Islamic Mosque and now Museum is an architectural wonder that gets far less notoriety than it deserves. Starting life as the Capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD this magnificent building has interesting stories to tell from the ancient world to the current day.This is the very spot the Roman Empire ended and Istanbul was born and the Ottoman Empire fornd immortality. The battle of the Sultan to finally take what was then called Constantinople is well worth researching before you visit to help appreciate the enormity of the building and city in the ancient and modern world.The battle and subsequent victory of the Sultan changed history as we know it and was also the first time WMD was used in warfare. The tactical game of war chess that unfolded here is testimony to the young Sultans tactical genius and was a huge loss to Rome who took far too long to come to Constantinople's aid and lost this part of the world forever to the Turks.You can simply wander around and enjoy the space and the wonderful mix of Christian and Islamic artwork or you can deep dive into learning about it's origins and how the Sultan removed all Christian artifacts and plastered over all Christian artworks to replace them is Islamic art and symbols. The plaster has been painstaking removed but this is why you can still see traces of it today.Don't miss the walkway up to the upper level on your immediate left as you enter as the upper level has stunning views and yet more secrets to reveal.Keep an eye out for the Viking graffiti and slow yourself pause for thought as you walk past the doors to heaven and hell. If you prefer not to research before hand It's well worth considering hiring a guide on the day to talk you through this magnificent monument."
One hour in Hagia Sophia,"Breathtaking, wonderful architecture, very clean, full of meaning for both Christians and Muslims. If you are able, walk up the ramp to the top since the view from there is worth it!"
A must,"The history of Byzantium in one place. The church of Agia Sofia is a greate place even that the Turks are not care a lot about that, and the conditions are not good. You can feel the history and the Byzantine emperors before the feel down and the misserable of the years after."
Beautiful,Breathtaking. Not a single second of regret for visiting. Mesmerized by the beauty of it all the way.
Unique former religious site,"A well known site in Istanbul, Hagia Sophia is unique in that it has been used as a pagan, Christian and Islamic place of worship. Restoration has uncovered evident of all three forms of worship and Hagia  Sophia is the only place in the world like this. There's a second floor viewing area that may seem daunting to get to, but instead of stairs its accessible by a ramp. All in all, an interesting site to visit."
Living history,The Hagia Sophia stems from times as Istanbul was still called Constantinople. This is a must see in Istanbul.
A must see.,"The Hagia Sophia is breathtakingly impressive to visit. An absolutely must see.The description in the guides is good, but seeing the site is really something different."
definitely stop by.,this church is legendary. It has been used as a mosque since 1453. It became a very valuable mosque as a museum. definitely stop by.
Michele McMaster,"So much history, so beautiful.  Lots of restoration been done.Was magnificent to see the Christian part of the mosque 🕌 been detailed, loved seeing all that history."
Must see,"Hagia Sophia Museum is a must seen. Unless you know a lot of history you can enter by yourself if not I highly recommend you to go with a tourist guide (They are outside the museum). They will make you skip line so you will skip more that one hour in the queue. It will cost around 400 liras, but they are totally worth it ."
Hagia Sofia...an Istanbul must,"The Hagia Sofia in Istanbul is a sight not to be missed. Over the centuries, this has been a cathedral and mosque depending who were the conquerors. We got there first thing in the morning. There are some locals who have certified tour guide licenses. They offer to take you through the Hagia for a price. I think we paid $30USD for 30 minutes for the two of us. It was worth every penny. He took us through and pointed out the most interesting things...and gave a good history. He also showed us how to get to the upper level for some awesome photos. Highly recommend."
Must See!,"Beautiful and historic, definitely a must see.  Parts if it are under restoration now, but still a site to behold!"
Not the most beautiful church in the world though quite impressive,"Unfortunately the Muslims vandalized the church so do not get your hopes up as so many people have hyped this building.  In my opinion the Ottoman architecture simply dwarfs this basilica and inside nothing remains except two images of Jesus one mosaic in which he is making a Buddhist mudra sign with his hand and another but both of them only partially remain as the conqueres literally tore the images off the walls and graffitied the entire ceiling in Arabic.  It is quite depressing.  However the Blue Mosque is absolutely gorgeous and is right next door.  There were some interesting elements including tombs outside the church and the ancient walkways leading to the second level of the church with the lovely partial mosaic mentioned upstairs but the church is a trashed relic and not the incredible splendor that so many make it out ot be.,  It was probably gorgeous in 400 AD however it has been completely trashed and little remains I was extremely dissapointed in it as I am from a Christian Background.  At the same time I appreciate fine architecture and realize that the Hagia Sophia cannot compete with the aesthetic of the Ottoman.  Ottoman architecture is astounding and much more impressive than any other architecture in Europe(Istanbul is Europe). Be warned if you are expecting to see a beautiful in tact church.  This should be labeled a ruin as that is what it is.  From the outside it is impressive but it is an eyesore inside for aesthetes.  If you are an historian or a very religious Christian without a great aesthetic perhaps you'll like it. I took many more photos of The Blue Mosque.  I found this place depressing but I guess Erdogan's regime is not going to put money into restoring a Christian monument-Obviously not."
History at it’s best,Amazing building with rich history from when the Romans were defeated by the Ottomans and the church was converted to a mosque. Such magnificent architecture even for today’s standards. A definite must see for any one visiting Istanbul.
The history of Constantinople un one majestic building,"Do not miss Hagia Sophia. Cathedral, then Mosque, now museum, the building has seen centuries of struggles, religion shifts, and invasions.  Do not forget visiting 2nd floor."
Loved it ,Is the first time I have been there and I need to say that I am positively impressed. I guess is originally Greek but not belong to Turkish but  still nice please to visit.
Worth a visit,This place is worth a visit if you love history and architecture. We enjoyed our trip with lot of culture and history.
Impressed ,Such an history able to stay for years ...everyone should visit every of Istanbul of course Hagia Sophia first.
Beautiful and tasteful,Fabulous interiors - spells class and is timeless. Love the colours and the lighting. The views from the top floor is fantastic
Fantastic,"We visited the Hagia Sohia, in the early morning which was our first day in Istanbul. There was a long queue in front of it. But we were prepared and buyed our tickets online. This historic place is fantastic."
History at it's best!!!,"When next you're in Istanbul, be sure to visit Hagia Sophia!! The site is spectacular and a must see... And when your done...be sure to go to the gift shop next to it!"
istanbul history,That place is the start of historic peninsula tour.must visit and learn the past.that place is a museum and busy.Go as early as you can
I only wish I could have sung/chanted!,"The Hagia Sofia is always awe-inspiring. Be sure to sit and watch the brief film, for lots of great information about this historic location. Take the stairs up to the gallery, and try to find the angels in the eaves. Take photos that will never do that place justice. But don't try to sing in there... lol"
Hagia Sophia - 1500 years history,Beautiful architecture and great perspective on the history of the nation. It is quite amazing that it was used as a church for approx 900 years and then 500 years as a mosque but now it is open as a museum - giving everyone an opportunity to study this great monument
1453,"Kilise değil Ayasofya müzesi camii, not church mosque of haiasofia bla bla please smile puahssxsxcccc"
Amazing place,"+ Just plainly a beautiful place! very great details everywhere- They were under renovation, so some part we could not see much"
Half day tour in istanbul ,It was good experience to know the history of the place . Many visitors goes there . About for tourist attraction site are near by Advisable to visit if you have chance
Impressive in so many ways,"This place alone is worth a travel to Istanbul. I have no words to describe how impressive it this building is. Not to mention it's rich history. If you are in doubt, go se it yourself."
Michele McMaster,"It was magnificent, lots of restoration been done, but still so much to see.Lots of history.   Not so busy this time of year."
Lovely,"Best shared with someone, brilliant history. Gardens are stunning, architecture mind blowing and People are helpful. Take a tram in and walk the areas."
Wonderful Place,"I like the place, the church is so nice, full of paintings and its like a museum. However, a long queue to get into the church. The surrounding area is perfect, you will enjoy being there by walking. The public transportation is available as well, however try to reach there early to avoid peak hours."
A must visit,"It's a must visit historical building, the most iconic attraction in Istanbul. It's amazing how a Greek Orthodox Cathedral church could turn to an Ottoman Empire mosque, now a museum. I'd recommend you to hire a guide as he would tell you the history behind."
Wonderful historical center,Great spot not be to passed up a major opportunity when visiting istanbul. It has such a large number of narratives and to appreciate the design of the structure.
Huge and spectacular......,"This whole area is loaded with things you must do on a visit to Istanbul. The site is  inscribed on Unesco’s World Heritage list, which recognises the “architectural masterpieces” of Istanbul.Be aware that it needs to be seen NOW as it is in the middle of a controversy. Islamists have long prayed for the Hagia Sophia to reopen as a mosque, arguing that its neutral status is an affront to the Ottoman caliph’s decrees forbidding other uses. The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to revert the 6th century Hagia Sophia, once an important Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral, into a mosque from its current status as a museum. It has been a museum for almost 85 years, which is widely regarded as a compromise between Christians and Muslims who both claim the space as hallowed ground.A Christian group is arguing for a return to it being a  Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral.Either way, see it now and be amazed at the elements of both religions on view. PS: It cost $15 to get in. There can be long lines. I am disabled and I went to the front of the line and showed my Social Security card. They waved me in for no cost. Be aware,there is almost no place to sit and there are some steps - some too high for me. There also is an upstairs that I was unable to get to. There is a movie to see that explains a lot. There are some sets there."
Interesting place full of history ,"Lovely place to wander around entry fee was reasonable and lots of information to read inside, worth having a read up before visiting though."
Amazing,Very beautifull pleace. when we enter inside we feel like we went into the history somewhere. it is really amazing
Great But not that amazing,"As an Iranian who has visited the Pink mosque in Shiraz and the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan, visiting the great Mosque of Hagia Sophia was not that amazing the Mosque was big the main hall was under construction also had nice architecture and the museum had some special religious items special for Muslims, for sure for the Europeans and Americans it worth more"
My Favourite of them all just amazing.,"So the entrance here is not free so be sure to purchase a museem pass if you plan to visit them all it works out a lot cheaper.This place is amazing set across two levels you get fantastic views of everything and Ii could have spent several hours in here.It has a mix of religions which is very interesting, I fell in love with this place."
Strolling through centuries.,"Best time to visit,early in the morning,right before opening hour because it can get pretty crowded.You should hire a guide,as the information and history regarding the museum is rich.Take a coat with you,it's high humidity creates low temperature.Watch your step during your ascent to the second floor,it is slippery."
Amazing place!,"Beautiful structure from the outside and very interesting and eclectic items inside, owing to the fact that Ayasofya was first a Christian church dating back 1500 years, then a mosque, and now a museum."
Beautiful combination of religions,"While some of it was under construction during my visit the old church/mosque is magnificent! If history is your thing make sure to make a wish with your thumb in the pillar, see the Viking graffiti and old the old mosaics in gold are stunning! I have mixed feelings about the audio guide - there aren't very many plaques around explaining the history of the place to rely on otherwise - but the layout of the audio guide is a mess and the information is a bit hit and miss - given that you have to pay for it anyways perhaps getting a proper guide - of which there are plenty around -  is another good option to look into?"
Impresive monument,"Impresive monument  of culture from old century.Great view,amazing complexities of arhitecture.Really impressed"
great experience,"Hagia Sophia is one of the most impressive museums of Istanbul; built as a Christian church, then converted into a mosque, now serving as a museum. I was so pleased that i cannot express it in my words."
Beautiful cultural icon,You haven’t been to Istanbul if you haven’t visited the Hagia Sophia. Reasonable price to see stunning and unique architecture. We didn’t go for the audio guide option but there were plenty of information cards around so it’s totally fine to visit it alone
Lovely ,Really realy nice we absolutely love hagi sofia and we love Istanbul we will definitely come back to here
Over priced,"It is not a museum actually it's only part of the curvh/mosque that is open, the grand hall. Beautiful structure and amazing to see but the ticket for only that is overly priced I think since there's nothing to see except the grand hall and some ruins in the entrance area. Ticket is 105 turkish lira."
The place for history buffs,A must go if you're in Istanbul if you're interested in history and significance of the place. However entrance fee is a bit steep and if you go now a lot of the place has some renovations or restorations going on.
Awe-inspiring!,A must-see when visiting Istanbul. A meeting of Christian and Muslim religious art and architecture transporting you back in history and the opportunity to marvel at human achievement.
When visiting Istanbul this attraction is a must,"Hagia Sophia, from the 6th century, is not only a sight in Istanbul, but probably one of the most fascinating buildings worldwide. When visiting Istanbul this attraction is a must.The interior is artistically decorated.Originally built as the center of Christian religion in the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. At the same time it was the coronation church of the Roman emperors. It was built by the Roman Emperor Justinian I, who wanted to have the most magnificent and beautiful building in the world built. The dome is 56 meters high and 31 meters in diameter.When the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque."
Construction is still going on,"We were here ten years ago. There was a construction going on on that time. We wanted to see it again and yes, there was still a construction going on. But the entrance fee did not drop, the price is ridiculous. It is a beautiful building with an amazing history, but the price is overdone and the construction blocks too much."
better than the blue mosque,"really enjoyed this, found it more interesting than the blue mosque. Fastinating history and beautiful mosaics."
Interesting and impressive,A glance into many centuries of history through a huge and impressive church/mosque/museum.  Cafe and gift shops on site.  Worth the entrance fee.
Lovely Hagia sophia,"Like simbol of past times. Gorgeus outside, gorgeus inside. Kerubins on the dome with amazing caligraphy. So peaceful and huge. If you visit it the best time is early in the morning. After that it is crowded with People."
Worth It!,Much better than Blue Mosgue. More character. While there were some renovations to one wall the rest is beautiful. Take binoculars to see the Virgin Mary in her detail.
Fascinating,"The attraction needs a solid hour inside to see. The central area is massive and you will want to take some time admiring the lights, pillars, alter, windows and dome in general. There are interesting smaller naves to each side which are worth walking past. Look closely at the marble panels that have been cut thinly and placed on the wall to mirror each other. The upper level is reached by a great cobblestone ramp to the left of the main entrance, just inside the door. It criss crosses back and forth several times taking you to the top. It is wide enough for an old carriage! It is not so crowded up there, as many people don't see the ramp!!!  Once upstairs the view down onto the main floor is amazing, and the lights are so close you may touch them. Walk around the whole area for the best photos. The stairs down are at the back."
An amazing building with an interesting history.,This building is breath-taking. It is worth reading the history of the building before arriving to truely appreciate the structure and how it has been a reflection of the city.  It is interesting to see the Christian frescoes upstairs and the rich marbled walls and floor. The light inside is magical.
Breathtaking,The Ayasofia is simply breathtaking and a wonderful reminder that Christianity and Islam can live together in one house. I'm all the richer for this visit.
Unmissable ,One of the architectural wonders of the world.  It's worth the trip to Istanbul just to see this.  It's amazing even before you stop and consider that it's 1500 years old
Exceeded our expectations ,"Having heard of this church in history lessons, we thought we had a good idea of what it would be like, but in reality, the sheer scale and history of this place far surpassed our expectations. Having initially been a Christian church for centuries before being converted to a mosque, seeing the unique combination of religious artefacts and frescos of two historically conflicting religions in one place was refreshingly inspiring. The sheer height and scale of a building that was built centuries before modern construction methods was awe inspiring, and to think that many of the actual steps that we walked upon had been used by people nearly a millennia ago. It is definitely an inspirational idea to create it as a museum where any race, creed or person can walk through this magnificent historical artefact. This is a must see."
"Impressive from the outside, barren on the inside",See title. I would also suggest that you not bother with the audio guide. There is enough information written in English next to the limited areas of interest to be found inside. It really needs an  interactive type of guide/app that gives you artist impressions of what this building looked inside like during its many reincarnations.
A Very Ancient Landmark,"Incredible, truly impressive! This mosque is famous for its massive dome and the world’s largest building of its kind during its time. Built around 360 and know it took over 200 years to build, Sophia, aka Sofya was the first imperial mosque of Istanbul. The building served different purpose as originally it served as an Orthodox Cathedral, then a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire and then a mosque and now to be a museum. I have seen structures like this in Delhi, the Qutub Minar where it was a Hindu structure, then due to power grabbing, became a mosque. You can tell the difference because a mosque cannot have any images like flowers, people or statues, only calligraphy. At QM, you can see some of the structures were still left with the Hindu remnants. In this place, the guide was narrating the story and I noticed the same where images of the Virgin Mary, the cross and Jesus were still visible on the dome. I mentioned to the guide and asked why it was not covered by the Muslims. He said it was actually covered (not destroyed) and now it is revealed again. So if you look on the dome, there are images of the Virgin Mary All etched in gold. Ahhh history."
Nice and magnificent ,Well it is little bit different than what one sees in films and pics. Little bit disappointed about the maintenance. Sad such a good craftsmanship not preserved as it has to.
Beautiful,"When we visited Hagia Sophia, it was under renovation. I would have liked to have been notified before I bought the ticket, which did not happen.In any case, it is a place worth visiting. I recommend visiting the objective in the evening, because there are not so many tourists."
A must-see in Istanbul,"The Hagia Sophia is beautiful. The fascinating history of the place, the mosaics, the immense space -- a must-see for all who visit Istanbul. It is worthwhile to spend some time to sit and watch the video in the entrance area. It will give you a better appreciation of the Hagia Sophia."
Spectacular! ,Truly unique and interesting! There were so much to see! So much history and beautiful details eveywhere.We really enjoyed our visit  and would highly recommended to anyone visiting Istanbul!
Highlight of the trip,This place was absolutely amazing even if some of the images had been painted over. The calligraphy on the walls was exquisite and they had a giant picture of the Virgin Mary. Strongly recommend and it is a good place to see first.
The highlight of our trip ,What an amazing place! We had the most interesting visit . We also bought museum card however it wasn’t value for money. The most interesting places included in price are Topcapi Palace. You still need to pay extra for Galata Tower or cistern Basilica . In my opinion 249tl is not a good value as you won’t use it.
Feel the history,We were here a Friday in February. It wasn’t crowded by tourists and we could take our time. Well worth the visit. Unfortunately a lot of the building is being restored at the moment so there is a lot of constructions everywhere. Still - don’t miss it!
Àmazing building in the heart of istanbul,"The Hague Sophia is an amazing building. We visited in February which is low season. Arrived for 9 am opening and quickly entered. Even in low season it does get busy so recommend going early. Plus leß crowded inside and beats the large coach tour groups that were soon filling the place.  Make the effort to take the route up to the upper gallery's. Not easy to find but it is the corner of the building nearing the weeping column.  Within easy walking distance is the cistern, blue mosque and hippodrome where museum of Turkish and Islamic arts are which are all worth seeing. So a full day in a small area."
Aya Sofia,If you are Greek you must go to see Aya Sofia one time in your life..it is not ony a orthodox church...it is the Christianic home... memories...you feel like someone who lost they house and after years go back to find it..Amazing place
Great place to see history,"This an emblematic monument of Istanbul, with remnants of the old Byzantine church under the new form of an Ottoman mosque."
Less than expectation,Ayasofya is a big and beautiful Mosque (Church) that hasn't any special thing rather than other mosques
Tourism,This church is unique sight to see . The tour guide explained it very well. It is very large and it can really capture the mind. Definitely go to the second floor.
Excellent historical site,"Excellent place to visit for the vast history it holds. Do your homework before coming, you need to understand the history of the vast building before you come, would recommend. Buy multiple visit 3 day pass for 3 different sites, was 162 lira each. Don't buy off anyone off the streets, pay bit more do it properly"
Hagia Sophia steeped in history ,What an incredible building. The Hagia Sophia is  an iconic structure carved out in the landscape of Istanbul. It’s a beautiful building with amazing historical interest. Parts of the building is currently undergoing renovation but there is still plenty to see and definitely worth visiting.Entrance fee is quite expensive but you can see where the money is spent. Stunning! Definitely worth a visit.
Stunning Architecture; Stunning History,"The longevity of this structure and the historical significance of the building is fascinating. Once a church and then, due to political intervention, a mosque--this structure is magnificent and a testimony to the power of religion in preserving fantastic houses of worship.  We visited the Hagia Sofia on our own and fully appreciated the importance of the building with a bit of independent reading. You will marvel at the size of the structure and the beauty of the inside work. It's almost difficult to fathom the size of the building (taller than the Statue of Liberty and larger than Notre Dame) but will be appreciated when you visit.  Tiles that have restored (after having been covered up) are beautiful and the impressive nature can not be under-estimated."
Amazing place full of history loved the mosaics ,"Early start again no waiting to get it though it did start to get busier with tours etc.Entrance cost of 72tl around £10 Uk money, well worth it.I was fascinated by the mosaics they have been uncovered from the plaster and they re truly stunning, to imagine the whole building covered in these must have been a sight to behold.The sheer size of this place leaves you feeling in awe of those who designed and built it. Opens 9-5 and shuts on Mondays.Spend 2 hours here lovely place to see and  defo on your list of places to visit."
Fun experience,We visited Hagia Sophia on our own which was cheaper than using a tour company. My brother had visited Turkey before so he was my tour guide but there are recordings that one can hire at the site. The museum is beautiful and has rich history about christianity and islam. It is definitely somewhere one must visit in Istanbul
Amazing,Absolutely stunning building ! I’m not religious but had no idea the different faiths that are in there! Amazing
One of the star attractions in Istanbul,"This is one of the most important structures in Istanbul, and it is unmissable.  A delight for history buffs, and photo buffs. But, please, don't try to do this on your own.  Guidebooks and the internet can give you a lot of information, but you ought to get a good local tour guide who speaks your language, OR, you ought to join a specialised organised tour that covers this site. There is too much to see, and too much to get explained. Our local travel agent in Istanbul, Efendi Travels, organised a guided tour of this place. This huge structure was a church for around 900 years under the Byzantine emperors, built by the Emperor Justinian in the year 537. Then, it was a mosque for about 450 years under Ottoman rule. Finally, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, converted it to a museum in 1935, in keeping with his secular principles. Now, it is a museum dedicated to both Orthodox Christianity and to Islam.  As a church, it was the largest church in Christendom. The dome is still one of the largest in the world, and is very impressive both from outside and from inside. The minarets were added by the Ottomans.  Some other striking features: the four large Ottoman Medallions with huge calligraphy, the mosaics, and the Seraph figures.  Your guide will point out all these to you, and give you explanations.  I am very sorry we were pressed for time, I would have loved to spend about three hours here. Sadly, we got only half that much.  Very easy to negotiate with a stroller.  There are good toilet facilities outside the church. It would help if you had binoculars, some of the details are so high up, (and the place is not too well lit!) it is a bit difficult to see it properly with the naked eye. I used my camera's zoom lens, but a pair of binoculars would have been better."
Impressed,"Very interesting historical place, its a church and mosque at the same time!!Have both roman and othomans signature"
I am not overly religious but this was a spiritual revelation I never thought I would experience,"In August of 2019 we spent a week in Old Istanbul and visited several famous historical sites, one of which was the Ayasofya Museum/Church/Mosque.We were staying at the Yasmak Sultan Hotel and they arranged for a walking tour guide to take us to several historical sites. We paid that guide a 100 Euros for the day and it was well worth the price. We were one on one with the guide, he was personable, educated and incredibly knowledgeable.The cost for going into the Ayasofya was 144 Turkish lira for the 2 of us. The Ayasofya Church was built was built from 530AD to 535AD by 10,000 laborers,it is all brick and mortar, no steel in the structure. It was a Greek Orthodox church for 1000 years and when the Turks conquered the area it was turned into a Mosque for 400 years. For the last 80 plus years it has been a Museum honoring both the Church and the Mosque. I am not a very religious person but when you walk into the Ayasofya there is definitely a feeling that you are in a very special place, The structure itself is enormous and a tribute to what mankind was capable of building by hand over1500 years ago.The always ongoing restoration of the Ayasofya is in itself a labour of love and a labour of historical art  preservation of both the Christian and Muslim religions under the same roof. ll spent.The reason I have waited this long to do this review is because I had a lengthy illness that I have now recovered from it and for that I apologize for the delay. .Dave CToronto Canada."
Architectural beauty,"Must visit when in Istanbul.Rich in history, best to visit with a guide who can elaborate on the history of the Hagia Sophia. The mosaics were incredible works of art. Unfortunately, many parts have been destroyed."
Beautiful musieum,Great place not be to missed out when visiting istanbul.It has so many histories and to admire the architecture of the building.
Amazing Experience,This place is opposite the blue mosque and 5 minutes walk from the Topkapi palace. Very busy at times but a must see in Istanbul.
Hagia Sofia,Covered by informative narrative through the audio tour which we purchased. The guides are also very well informed and my teen happily explored each item and we ended up staying for over 2 hours.
Beautiful,It is purely historical .Holly building should be visited. Very easy to get there with train metro in Istanbul.
Beautiful museum,"very impressive even though there's still ongoing renovation works. was planning to visit it around noon, reached to see snaking queues all the way outside. a local told me the crowd thins out at 3pm. the queue was definitely shorter. a must visit!"
Mr,"Great place, incredibly large.... You can feel history inside. Also perfect for hot days as a place to hide from sun 😁"
The Amazing Ayasofya Church/Mosque/Museum,"Each year since 2007, my wife and I travel to our family home in Macedonia for a month or more to visit friends, relatives and maintain the home there. We always try to put a week aside to visit different countries like Greece, Turkey etc. In August of 2019 we spent a week in Old Istanbul and visited several famous historical sites, one of which was the Ayasofya Museum/Church/Mosque in Istanbul. We were staying at the Yasmak Sultan Hotel and thanks to them, they arranged for a walking tour guide to take us to several historical sites. We paid UMAR,our guide a 100 Euros for the day and it was well worth the price. We were one on one with UMAR and he was personable, educated and incredibly knowledgeable. The best part was because we had a guide, we did not have to stand in the many long lines for these different sites. They had a separate booth for guides to pay and go directly into the location. |The cost for going into the Ayasofya was 144 Turkish lira for the 2 of us.

Harmonazation of Church and Mosque,"We really like the history of Hagia Sofia. Beside that, we admire the ornamen and the bulding construction."
Very interesting tour.,"The murals on the ceiling are worth looking at and interesting, with the juxtaposition of the Muslim pictures hung around the main atrium.  It is definitely worth a visit."
Breathtaking.,"I am not a history buff, but I do find history interesting. Hagia Sophia is a place of historical importance, a breathtaking massive beautiful building. I felt totally at awe at by the sheer size of it, considering when it was built, and the history of it. You walked into an entirely different ambiance of that of the modern world. It is like you step into different time, different 'world'. If you go to Turkey and in Istanbul, I think you must see it. To put your feet on the ground of something so magnificent... it will stay with me for a very long time. Hagia Sophia was a church and center of government in the Byzantium time and Eastern Roman empire. It was taken over by Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman and turned into a mosque. The Christians attributes were all covered during the period, now they are uncovered and you can see the mozaic and traces of chisselled out crosses. They 'live' alongside Arabic calligraphy. Just beautiful."
Just a dream,"Such a amazing place.You breath something else.You feel somewhere in out of world ,in other planet.Just go and see it."
Wonderful,Hagia Sophia is an unquestionable requirement visit in Istanbul. Its a congregation that was changed over to a mosque and gives a look into the historical backdrop of the city. It is totally delightful and in the most memorable piece of the city. Totally dazzling!! :-)
historical museum,It is holy for a religious person and impresses even when you are not religious.I would definitely recommend buying the museum card which will pay for itself if you visit
Must see ,"An amazing building, well preserved and illuminating. We booked a guide through Istanbul.com who really brought the Hagia Sophias journey from church to mosque to museum to life. A must see..."
Simply Stunning  in Scale - a Must See,"From the moment you step inside this magnificent building you can sense the ‘genie loci’ of this amazing edifice - the layers of history seem to almost lap over you like gentle waves - Do read up about it before hand as to listening to the guide while trying to feel the building itself, can be distracting. tbh for me this building had one of the greatest sense of history in time of almost any other that I have visited - although Glendalough in Ireland could match it, for me, for tearing back the veil of time   * Pre-Book your Museum Ticket and Arrive early - there are queues *"
Very good experience,Fantastic experience with an experienced guide. Learnt a lot snd mostly yried to get and feel a sense of belonging in this magnificent place. A must for first time visitors
Under heavy renovation,"This stunning church/then mosque and now museum, is currently under heavy restoration, with half of it being blocked off.What we were able to see was still stunning, and its worth the visit."
Scaffolding and chaotic ,"It was chaotic from beginning to the end... first there’s a really unclear sign of where to get the tickets, there are two massive queues but no one seems to know where to go, it took me 30 mins with tons of squeezing, pushing and shouting to finally get to the ticket booth which only had 2-3people working in it. It is completely chaotic without any sort of order.Once inside I realised that half of the mosque is covered by a huge scaffolding and completely ruins the experience. In my opinion the place is quite overrated and way too busy and crowded.....I really didn’t enjoy it.Luckily I’ve visited it and I never need to go back again."
Truly Amazing,"This is so hard to put into words as they probably wont do it justice. you just stare in amazement at the beauty of this Mosque. the art work, the tiles, just everything was so wonderful. if you viosit Istanbul you must make this a priority visit."
Memorable experience,"Had a wonderful and memorable experience whilst visiting and learning about the his history and culture of Hagia Sophia. Our guide Hassan was very informative, friendly and funny. We loved seeing it as a family."
Amazing,Fantastic piece of history.  The architecture is amazing and the images dating back over 500 years are very impressive.
Awe inspiring visit,"It is very difficult to describe the visit when the real experience can only be felt by actually going there. The place is really awe inspiring, speaking of a cultures and architecture from the past 1,500 years. Currently, renovations are going on, but there are enough spots to see both on the ground and upper floor to inhale the ancient impressions of art and culture present there. Best time to visit - cold season as not too many people will block your views and experience."
Great Historic Site,"Touring the Hagia Sophia is an amazing experience.  It is hard to think that the building is over 1,500 years old and was the first place visited by Mehmet II when he captured Constantinople in 1453.  The architecture is amazing and the images dating back over 500 years are very impressive.  Since it is a museum and is no long a Mosque you do not have to remove your shoes.  I would consider a visit to this site a must for anyone visiting Istanbul."
Chapel like in Vatican,Absolutely a must! Fantastic piece of history. Christianity and Islam under one roof.Located in the heart of the Sultan quarter.It is a massive chapel with breathtaking mosaic and texts from Koran. Fantastic view on Blue Mosques from windows on the balcony.The entry fee is 72TL.
Maintenance,"The site is under maintenance. We didn't see anything on the grounds that the spot is under maintenance, and lamentably, nobody overseeing the spot educated us concerning this"
An interesting site,"It is absolutely amazing to see how such a massive structure was built and made in olden days.It is also kinda creepy if I am honest to see how the two styles of Christian and Islamic decoration and architecture collide.I recommend getting the audio tour, there will be many scammers outside offering you a tour and a quick pass ticket for insane prices like 400 lira per person (this is what happened to me), there is a nice package including ayasofia, topkapi, and archeology museum for 175 lira."
Must be visited,Nice location in sultanahmet  and can reached by sultanahmet tramvay station and the entence fee cost about 74 turkish lira and very crowded and long Q for waitingNice architecture nice historic icon must be visited when you are in the Istanbul
Well kept history,"Hagia Sophia is a must visit if you go to Istanbul. They have maintained and kept a good history relating to Jews, Christian and Muslim Prophecies. They have the Stick carried by Moses (Peace be upon him) and many other items to name."
Shorter wait if you use the kiosks ,"There are very aggressive guides all around the entrance area trying to sell their services. One pitch they use is that they can save you an hour wait in line. But the wait really wasn’t that long, at least on a Tuesday in Feb. Just inside the gate before the shack where you buy tickets is a set of kiosks. The most prominent ones sell the Iststanbul museum pass which is expensive and gives admission to a bunch of museums. But the rightmost two machines, which are not prominently marked, sell tickets to the Hagia Sofia at the normal price. No one was using them so I just walked right up and bought our  tickets with no wait, then we walked right in.  I have no idea why no one else standing in line did that! Once inside it’s pretty spectacular but not five stars besides there is a lot of it under restoration and blocked off or covered with scaffolding. Still a great visit but not as great as it would be without the construction."
Worth visiting,I’m not a history geek at all but Hagia Sophia’s history is so fascinating and interesting. Hagia Sophia is apparently really important to Turkey’s History.I’d recommend you to take a guide along because otherwise you’d just be staring at walls without knowing the relevance of anything.
The site is under maintenance,"The site is under maintenanceWe did not see anything because the place is under maintenance, and unfortunately, no one supervising the place told us about this"
"Peaceful and beautiful, go with guide","It's was very peaceful and beautiful, go with a guide to explain the history and everything about it, really nicee pictures"
history at hand,"One of the most important historical landmarks, absolutely impressive and outstanding. It's a must!!!"
More impressive from the outside,"It looks a lot nicer on the outside then on the inside, if you google it and see the pictures online, that’s pretty much all there is to see. Also there are a lot of scammers standing on the outside trying to offer you a tour guide. It’s 72TRY and the audio guide comes at an extra charge which is way too expensive for my liking. Rather look at it from the outside and go to the blue mosque which is free."
Amazing ,This museum was incredible. So it was a church turned into a mosque which later turned into a museum. A huge tourist attraction as well as the Blue Mosque. Definitely worth the visit and climbing to the top.
Must see,See title! This is a really beautiful building and well worth spending time in. Even the ramps to the higher levels are interesting
Amazing place,"Entrance very crowded.If you want to visit that museum,you need ticket or museum pass.Wonderful church museum,amazing"
Absolutely lovely,Hagia Sophia is a must visit in Istanbul. Its a church that was converted to a mosque and gives a glimpse into the history of the city. It is absolutely beautiful and in the most historic part of the city.
Lovely ,"I love history, old buildings, churches & museums. So this place was definitely worth visiting.. I really enjoyed my time & would definitely go there again! P.S: please respect the dress-code, you can’t go there in tiny shorts & tank tops"
Very nice and history place,We going there with my friends.it was very big history place and nice wiew.higly recommend this place
Nice place,Beside Sultan Ahmet mosque great place to unlock your memories with a lot of historical stories and monuments. Will visit every time being in Istanbul.
Soul of both religions,This work must be visited to see how a historical building can resist against the time combining both religion.
My experince,My impression was ok not amazing..most of parts  in the place in renovation..take about 1 hour maximum.
History Blends with Art,A MUST visit in one's life. History and Art from the Byzantium Empire still kept in good shape. The chandeliers are glowing like they used to centuries ago. The mosaic speaks to you in many ways. Mesmerizing experience!
Spectacular ,"Fantastic experience-walk through the history, lots of sightseeing around the area but this is the best experience in Istanbul"
Excellent.. ,"Its a world treasure.. Wonderful, adorable and a really uniqe place that i can say.. Everyone have to see this place..."
Fundamental historical place that impresses,This is the true historical place that anyone should visit in this life. It is holy for a religious person and impresses even when you are not religious. Also many great souvenirs you can buy here for lovely people.
Stunning historical museum,A must see historical museum for all visitors in Instanbul.If you don't want to wait in big lines you should buy the museum card pass inside the museum and you can use in 14 other museums in Instanbul.
must see,"very interesting. Hagia Sophia Museum is a ""must-see"" visit, and the history behind it is fantastic."
Great ,"It's definitely worth the money to hire a guide in order to skip the queues and have someone explain the history behind this beautiful building in detail. I think without a guide, the experience would not be much. The building is stunning and they are currently in the midst of restoring it"
Exceptional,This is an amazing building considering its age and how its stood the ravages of time. The size humbles you considering when it was built. Shame about the length of time its taking to complete the renovations though.
Skip the line and get a guide ,Beautiful monument with a rich history. Queues can be long so luckily we have a skip the line pass and a guide to explain the main information of the site or else it’s less interesting to appreciate it. Good to spend an hour here.
Amazing,It's a well worth visit. Steeped in history you can feel it. I paid my admission and looked around without guides and there is plenty of information dotted around. The narration on the TV is well worth a listen too. Beautiful place.
A must visit!,Magical place with so many history. The only down it was they were under construction on some of parts which didn't allow to have a full view of the place. Still beautiful and worth the visit!
Church turned mosque turned museum,"The Hagia Sofia was an amazing place to visit. There's interesting mosiacs from when it was a church, before it was turned into a mosque. Great architecture. Interesting history. It's beautiful both inside and out."
"Under construction, but stunning!","Beautiful inside and out! The interior is somewhat simple and stark, but there is something absolutely exquisite about it. Take your time and soak it in; make sure to go upstairs and admire the views from above. They have an audio guide which is helpful, but not necessary (though if you want more of the history, you will need it, as there is no other information inside). Enjoy!"
When visiting Istanbul this attraction is a must,"Hagia Sophia, from the 6th century, is not only a sight in Istanbul, but probably one of the most fascinating buildings worldwide. When visiting Istanbul this attraction is a must.The interior is artistically decorated.Originally built as the center of Christian religion in the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. At the same time it was the coronation church of the Roman emperors. It was built by the Roman Emperor Justinian I, who wanted to have the most magnificent and beautiful building in the world built. The dome is 56 meters high and 31 meters in diameter.When the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque."
Must Do,The Hagia Sophia Museum & Church are a must do in Istanbul.We hire a guide from get a guide.Don’t hire one of the guides at entrance as they are very expensive.They quoted us more then double what we Paid.with the guide we learned a lot of the history of this amazing old building.
Walking tour of Istanbiu,"Beautiful monuments on the skyline. Close up they need some love. Our guide told us that the scaffolding in the Hagia had been there for thirty years. All the entrance money is being used for Turkeys war effort. Built almost 1500 years ago this is a beautiful building and the template for many of the cathedrals built subsequently. The mosaics, marvel jars and frescos are exquisite. Please save this wonderful monument?"
Over two centuries of history,The visit was like a crash course in history.  From the establishment of Constantinople to the ottoman period and beyond.  Covered by informative narrative through the audio tour which we purchased.  The guides are also very well informed and my teen happily explored each item and we ended up staying for over 3 hours.  Your imagination is key.  Must visit if you go to Istanbul.  I would definitely recommend buying the museum card which will pay for itself if you visit 5 or more museums specially because you get to skip the line.
Historical wonders,What a beautiful monument this is! Don’t even think about going to Istanbul without visiting this incredible building.
Rich in history and a must do,When traveling one tends to seek out the 'must see' attractions. Hagia Sophia is definitely one of those for Istanbul. To get the most from your experience a qualified guide would be a good investment.  If you don't have the time or budget you can hire audio recordings at the entrance gate.
Church/Masjed  ,"Extremely spiritual and beautiful place, a must seen site that has a lot of history stories to tell."
Just OK.,"The mosque looks better from outside, unfortunately. Half of the mosque was closed for restoration. Huge scaffolding was sitting inside and restricts view. It is OK to have it for free, but for the price I paid I would expect something good-looking and well maintained."
A Church first then a mosque and now a Museum thats Hagia Sofia.,"One of the best well preserved museum that used to be a Orthodox Byzantine church first then a Roman catholic church then later a Mosque by the Ottomans, It takes backs to memory lane at least 700 hundred years just entering the museum, Breathtaking hanging chandeliers and domes with many mosaic wall portraits and many changes it went thru during 3 empires. There's a Sultan Mehmet library just next to the huge pulpit for prayers during ottoman reign.Glass mosiac windows surrounding the domes is mesmerizing. One part of the columns are going thru restoration that takes at least 30 years. There are many tourist guides taking guest whom wants to show every part of the museum. otherwise there are just voice over headphones you cud purchase when you buy the entry tickets to the museum. I love history therefore i decided to check most part of the museum. Upstairs there is a passageway made for horsemen to reach the top floor. Not to forget two huge marble jar at ground floor where i found Sean Connery hid behind on of the jars in one of his bond movies. Other than that great for a historic photography which I've cherished to remember for a long time."
Agia Sofia ,AGIA SOFIA!The wisdom of the God!MUST VISIT!The monument where many religions have a story to say.
So much history and beauty,"One of the most iconic buildings in Istanbul. Was initially a church built around 500 years after Jesus's crucifixion, so there is a lot of biblical references. Many modifications to the structure due to natural disasters and fire. Later converted to a mosque with four large oval wooden boards holsted high in the massive dome, inscribed with Arabic verses from the Quoran. I think this spoilt the whole architecture and aesthetic of the dome, but it's good to have both religions represented in the same building. It is now a museum.One of the internal pillars is currently covered up and under restoration.When you get up to the upper gallery, you can see more restoration and the back of the four oval wooden boards and you will agree with me that it looks awful.Cost is 72 lira for entrance to all areas. First go and watch a 30 minute video of the museum. It is located on the left immediately on entering the entrance. Don't waste your money paying extra for the many guides available to show you round."
A must see in Istanbul,We really enjoyed walking around the Hagia Sophia. Sadly it was partially under construction both inside and outside which limited what we could see. Other than that we really enjoyed it!
Great Place,"First a great church and then a great mosque and now a great museum. If you only visit one historic site in Istanbul, this should be it."
