Discovery diving,"I always wanted to discover diving, and was the great opportunity on Havelock island, where see is clear and hot and nice reef full of wonderfull fishes. My experience with Andaman bubbles was really professionnal and friendly. I recommand them higly. Juste regreat to not have time to continue with opening water...Thanks to all staff of the team.The Frenchy couple"
Awesome diving experience in the Nemo Reef,"Myself and my wife were staying at Havelock in the Emereld Gecko Resort and wanted to go for scuba diving in the Nemo Reef. We went to Andaman Bubbles office at around 6 pm and they assisted us and smoothly booked the scuba dive next day at 8:30 am. The divers were very cooperative and we could experience to see a number of corals and marine species of fishes. Though we booked for a 30 minute dive, we dived for about 45 minutes though the dive duration depends on your agility to withstand pressure under water. We could reach the sea base easily. It was a lifetime experience which we would like to do again."
Scuba Diving,"We stayed at Wild Orchard and Andaman Bubbles is right next to the place ( sister concern is what they claimed). The person owning this seemed to be very arrogant in the way he spoke atleast, the staff were co-operative though. We reached the spot, he did not even bother to acknowledge as we were there for free..anyways the training was all done.. went into the water..very basic corals (mostly dead), the guide was very rude. The pictures were useless if you ask me, just the same pictures (one picture was clicked 10 times which is of no use). overall, we did not have a good experience, either select another operator or do it in Neil Island."
Experience of a lifetime,"Me and my husband have been to Havelock on the Christmas vacation and scuba diving was the major interest. So we were totally sceptic about choosing a dive centre. Havelock is crowded with dive centres and one gets confused easily. Fortunately we had already shortlisted few dive centres with the help of google reviews and Andaman Bubbles was one of them. We dropped in and the staffs were so cooperating. They smoothly booked a slot for next morning and also in a good price since it turned out that we were staying in one of their resorts. The service that they provided was exceptional in terms of punctuality, quality, picture qualities, pick n drop services and so on. We were really satisfied and it was a lifetime experience. Our instructors were awesome. They even managed to take pictures of us together under the sea. We saw a piece of heaven underwater. In add to this, they have a cozy bar with free wifi 😉😜 Thank you AB for this experience."
Free wi- fi! ,Free wi fi it offers! Thats the best part.. Coffee + Internet = best combo! The staff there would interact with you & will guide you will all possible knowledge they have about their place.
First Scuba diving,"I have always been interested in scuba diving, and it was successful this time through Andaman Bubbles. This was my first experience and it was wonderful. They prepare you well and I was especially happy for them making my mother comfortable for her first Scuba. A must try. Though the visibility depends on the weather yet the experience is awe inspiring. Thank you Andaman Bubbles, and a special thanks to Varghese, Tapu and Rizvan."
nice professional and well behaved people.,"Took their service for scuba diving at nemo beach. Their location is near dolphin resort at vijay nagar beach.The trainers were well behaved, encouraging and very helpful. would highly recommend them if are looking for scuba at havelock."
Small cafe by road,Simple / non descript cafe by the main road.Good snacks esp sea food  but the food offered is mostly un conventional/ continental.Generally thronged by backpackers hence families may not be comfortable.Well cooked tasty food though.They offer guided snorkelling / water sports too Review 3/5Recommedation Yes
Awesome diving,"My friend and I did the open water diver course with Hariharan of Andaman Bubbles and we had an awesome experience! Hari helps organise your dives such that you have time each day to do other things, as per the course requirements. On a sidetone, the dive shop also offers water you can fill into your bottle instead of purchasing water bottles, which is a very thoughtful touch."
Level 1 freediving,"I have traveled to the Andaman for scuba diving for a couple of years but this time for Free Diving. My instructor Mario Fernandes AKA SUPER MARIO was an expert in his training,approach and  very instructionally sound. He systematically identifies problematic aspects I was having and then structured a series of dives to address these areas. Giving feedback on performance after each dive. Safety was never compromised. Felt relaxed throughout the whole session. There was also a good training closure with tips on drills I could work on to improve my technique. Mario himself comes across as a friendly and approachable person who is generous with his advice and time. Really appreciate his hard  work during the session. Looking forward to the next level.""YOU MUST GIVE FREE DIVING A TRY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SUPER MARIO TRAINING YOU"""
Mr Elton fernandes,An amazing dive center with one of the best dive team I have ever met.The guys working there are very helpful and will go the extra mile to make your dive experience a memorable one.A special Thanks to MARIO fernandes for helping me complete my level 1 free diving course .seriously this guy is a superb trainer and makes things look easy.I never thought I could reach the depth at19.8mtrs and hold my breath for 3min 14sec all THanks to super MARIO. I am already planning my next trip this time to complete my level 2..
Awesome Scuba Diving Experience,"Since it was my first time for a scuba, I had an awesome scuba experience. For a first timer in scuba, it is difficult to catch up with the rules under water one has to follow, but the instructors are at your side. So do not worry. Just Go.!!! They take care of you in all possible ways. They show you the wonderful underwater marine life. Breath taking.!!! All instructors at Andaman Bubbles are too good, Mario, Rommel, Appu, Mani you guys are awesome. Thank you guys."
Super Scuba with Andaman Bubbles,"Ok, so lets get started! I was in havelock this march with my mom with Scuba diving on my list. Lucky me that I decided to check this off from my list with these guys. They are just AwEsOmE. Well i can't swim, this was my first dive and I have deep water phobia, with all these coveats I met Rommel, my diving instructor (hope I dint goofed up your name) at Neemo reef. He was soooo patient with all my goofy stuffs (laughing under water, my bad). Honestly, it was only because of him, I completed my fun dive with such beautiful memories. He made me completely relaxed, free from all anxiety with just one statement that you got oxygen with you underwater. Nothing will happen, just keep breathing 😇. And yes its true, I just dived in with Rommel and he showed me such pretty world underwater (loads of colorful fishes there). We went till 20 feets deep there. Small tip: pay attention to the techniques of ear pressure equalising, how to clean to glasses underwater and trust me you'll never panic. Just feel the water and bReAtHe. Thankyou so much! Rommel, Mario you guys are super fab! Keep up the great work 🤗🙂"
Nice,We experienced scuba diving for the 2nd time ..but this was good too.. safety wise but staff needs to be more cooperative..
Unreal underwater world with scuba diving ,"Havelock comes hand in hand with Scuba Diving .I did my Discover Scuba Diving course when I visited in November. We booked our 3 hour course well in advance with Mr Hari from Andaman Bubbles. They help you and guide you throughout the booking process , if you are a beginner and patiently help you out with all your queries. The course comprised of a 20 minute theory session with safety guidelines and underwater breathing techniques at their diving centre. After that they take you to their equipment center where you get your diving suit, fins and diving mask. Then we finally reach crystal clear waters and dip into the water. Everybody is accompanied with a private instructor ,upon entering the instructor first makes  us practise the breathing techniques , ear pressure clearing tricks, how to clear the masks if water gets in, what to do if your oxygen pipe comes off .All in all , they teach you the safety manual for any kind of situation underwater . It's a complete different world underwater for 45-50 minutes with the coloured corals and fishes all around.One of their videographer comes and  takes your photos and videos underwater . Once you are out and go back to the dive center you can take your pictures and videos on pendrive/phone instantly for memories for the future.Also, you get a certificate valid for thr next 5 years for the course completed which means your next scuba dive anywhere in the world ,you get yourself a discount ;) Andaman Bubbles - Very professional and fun to dive with :)"
Don't use this for any diving certification.,"I took my advance divers here. The instructor was terrible and when they sent my certification card, the name was wrong, it was for open water (theoretically I do not have advanced). All in all avoid this place. I have emailed them several times to send the corrected advanced certification card, but they have never complied, begged me to not write this review, so just a totally incompetent place."
The best diving course I could ask for!,"I just finish 2 star SSI diving course in the great bubbles diving center. I never dived before and found  the perfect place to start! All the guides are with perfect English and very professional attitude. They stand with all the highest safety standards and with good equipment. I had some ear problems during the course (something natural that can happen some times during dives) and the staff helped me deal with it and solved it slowly and patiently. I had the best time ever, and really happy that I chose this club, after comparing a lot of diving centers on the island, I can promise you, this is the best.Mario, Apou - thank you guys for making Andaman such a good experience for me, you are the best!"
Sea walk,"Everybody must enjoy their services. excellent management, timing and professionals. Divers and guide are good."
Diving with Hariharan,"Was lucky to dive again with Hari after 07 years - 2011 and 2018. A very gentle, patient and true professional. Flexible and innovative as per the customer capability but within the diving safety framework. Looking ahead to diving again with him in near future. Happy diving to the bubbles team."
Exciting times,"Me and my wife did a trydive and loved it so much we then booked our padi openwater course. Hari was great, kind and professional. was 4 day course and was a great challenge and extremely rewarding. big thanks to all the andaman bubbles crew."
Awesome experience - Nimo reef ,"It is one of the best thing to do in havelock, it is one of he best stress buster . You should give it a try . They charged me 3500₹ which was little costly but the experience was awesome 😎. We started at around 08:00AM and with such crystal clear water you will just forget the world and enjoy the beach and water . The Nimo reef is full of all the beautiful fish which are generally found in andaman. We were lucky enough to see one big fish too which is very rear in this place . So overall it was awesome experience thanks Andaman bubbles.👍🏻"
Amazing experience!,The divers are very experienced and they seem to know the water very well..Excellent place would definitely recommend Andaman bubbles to anyone visiting Havelock!
Wonderful,"It was wonderful. All the crew members of the scuba diving are very friendly and helpful, which made our first diving experience smooth. Although I panicked twice while diving, however, the diver who was with me, didnt lost his patience, which gave me enough energy to dive for third time and then I was able to do it smoothly. They also took underwater photographs of us. It was awesome. Keep it up guys, hope to see you again."
Best Scuba Diving Experience in Havelock Island,Andaman Bubbles. I would like to thank you for providing us one of the best Scuba Diving Experience. Me and my wife took the Scuba diving for the first time and the trainers trained and guided under water with proper guidance. We felt very comfortable and safe under water I would suggest Andaman Bubbles for people visiting Havelock Island and who would like to do the Scuba diving.
Had a good couple of dives in spite of unfavorable diving conditions,"We were in Havelock last week and as a group of 8 people we dived with the Bubbles team. Superb experience right from the pickup till we were dropped off to the resort at the end of the dive. We had 6 first time divers who had fun dives and the remaining 2 who were certified divers had a small refresher course before diving with Ashish in relatively shallow waters as that was all the conditions would permit. Kudos to Jack and his team for a great experience. And in spite of poor diving conditions, all of the 6 first timers came back saying they want to do more diving so that in itself is a great testimony. If I ever go back, I will dive with the Bubbles team again for sure."
Awesome experience,The experience was awesome.The dive instructors very polite and cooperative.Overall the activity was completely worth it.
Good prices for courses but they don’t have their own boat and have to rely on another school to have dives off sore.,"The course didn’t happen as planned in the begging, we had to make adjustments according to what the instructor thought was best for him."
They are the best!,"Very friendly, you'll have the best time there, under and above water. They are very attentive and they do their best (I was there for few days, and even if the planning was full they found a solution!). I recommend !"
Absolutely Amazing!,"The place & the people felt like a nice commune of like-minded, no nonsense people who all LOVED the Sea :-) I will surely go back ! <3"
Best place,Mario is the best guy ...who give us nice briefing ..i would love  to visit place again if mario works der ..best dive centre in andaman and staff very nice ..we enjoyed ot
first scuba - very well looked after,"My first experience of scuba. I was well taught, well looked after, and felt entirely confident with my dive-master. Only problem was that the boat broke down and we did a beach dive. Happy to recommend Bubbles."
Excellent experience....,must visit this place for out of the world experience of diving n underwater world.Personal attention n patience of the instructors n saving amazing sites of driving add to the overall enriching experience.
Wonderful Experience,"While doing my introductory dive with AB in Dec 2016 I had said that ""I would be back"" and am glad that I did !! Did my PADI open water dive certification course with AB and thanks to the excellent instructors it was a cakewalk. Special thanks to Jack and Suki who made the difficult seem easy. Only regret was the lack of diving in the open sea from the boat because if some Govt. regulation.My 2 daughters also did the introductory dive and they had a blast.I would highly recommend AB to any adventure seeker who is interested in scuba diving.And the free breakfast at Fat Martin Cafe is a bonus !!"
Scuba diving,"Had visited Andaman bubble on 13th and 14th may and enjoyed scuba with wonderful team... esp tappu, belgium and jack divers who helped in every way for even first timers and kids... My daughter Mishti had special mention and wrote on office wall of her experience 👍👌Best regards Vishnu"
I just LOVED IT!!,"I did the open water course at Andaman Bubbles, and other than them being extremely nice and welcoming, it was super professional and made my dream come true!! I'm sure the other guys are great as well, but Mario was my instructor, and he was just awsome!!Avishag"
Amazing time ! Excellent Service ....very friendly folks !,We love our snorkelling experince with Andaman Bubbles . Kids wanted to do snorkelling but i was little concerned about the safety of the children  ( as im not a good swimmer myself :P)  . Aditya and Mani ( instructors ) were both very friendly and accommodating . Kids enjoyed their snorkelling experience big thanks to Mani and Aditya .We are planning our next summer again at Andaman Bubbles !
Unsatisfactory Service and very much expensive. ,"Andaman Bubbles is very much expensive and the service they provided is not up to the mark,We have chosen trekking and snorkeling plan per head Rs 3000, we 3 people's were there and they assured that they will take us to unique place where turtles will be there and they will provide unique experience in snorkeling..............We  believed it and went  the guys who came with us they didn't show any unique place nor that they did what they assured  they just take us to elephant beach and they have done snorkeling , even they didn't took snorkeling photographs just they cheated.Stay away from this people's they are cheating the tourists. Funny part is  later I discovered there is boat service from havelock jetty and they take you elephant beach they will do all the activities and take you back, snorkeling is complimentary for this and the price comes just Rs950 per head."
"Probably good when everything is OK, but when there is a trouble....","Unfortunately, we arrived when all the boats were locked and diving impossible because of an unexpected event. No diving center was responsible of that. As a consequence, we couldn't dive. The problem came when we had to be refunded. We discussed about it one week before our departure from Havelock, we had to go to the center 3 consecutive days to ask again and again and again, nothing was ready, nobody was concerned, nobody had foreseen ... we had to do a sit-in to get our money. That's sad, they had one week to check everything, foresee the pay back, but no.... Fortunately we were saved by another diving center, which has the authorization to do boat dives and finally we had good holidays."
Best thing I did in Havelock,"Great experience, I learned a lot and had a great time under water.Thanks Mario (the best guide ever)!!"
Awesome experience!,"The kids love the water and were excited to go scuba diving. My twelve year old daughter’s comment....I had high hopes for my scuba diving trip and they were all fulfilled. This was an exhilarating experience that will always remain with me. Even though boats were banned in Havelock I didn’t feel like I missed out on anything.The instructors were very positive, caring and practical. They were there with us every step of the way and made this experience very enjoyable. I want to go back as often as I can. Maybe even spend all of my summer holidays diving!"
Found Nemo!!,Super happy with our dive and snorkeling trip with Andaman Bubbles. Big shout out to Ashish who was our dive instructor and Mani who took the kids snorkeling. Ashish was extremely thorough with instructions and guided me very well below the water. Mani was very friendly with the kids and they were very comfortable going out alone with him.
Now a DIve Master!,"Really great place to learn to dive. Very friendly staff, who are so passionate about what you see down there and making the experience special. It's also a great place to meet lots of cool people, and we met some really nice Israeli travelers who like the cafe/bar there. Missing the Andamans a lot!"
Best dive center !!!,"Hi I did a 2-star ssi diving course (owc+adv) And that was the best thing I'd ever done in my whole trip.The course was professional, fun and safe. The guides gave the feeling that they could be trusted.I would like to recommend my guide Mario without him the course was not as fun, interesting and that profesaional."
Home away from home!,"This summer we planned a dive trip in Andamans with a few guests of ours who were completing their Advanced Open Water Course. The short dive trip was planned with AB. We are so glad that we dived with AB on this trip. As we had kids (13 and 16 yrs old), we were a little worried on how they would handle the AOW course. But the crew at AB took complete charge and made the kids and all of us really comfortable and feel at home for the short duration that we were there. Each of the instrutors took special care and interest in all of our guests, makig sure that they enoyed every moment both in and out of the water. A big shout out to Hari, the Manager and Matial Ashiwn (Instructor) who were just brilliant. Last but not least, have to mention that AB has the best dive boat - SULTAN on the Island ...Its huge and extremely comfortable..Definitely diving with this professional and fun loving crew again! Cannot wait to be back..."
Awesome dive center!!,"Hey guys i did the SSI owc+aow course and it was awesome, the course was in english which is not my first language. they explained me everything till i felt 100% sure that i know what do i need to do under the water, and they were very patient about all the questions and the mistakes among the way. Each one in andman bubbles crew are amazing especially because they let me feel safe and they were very professional during the course and the fundives.And i want to thank mario and ashish for everything!!"
Disappointing ,"When visiting havelock island we were recommended to book a snorkelling trip through Andaman bubbles. When we arrived on the island we went in to book the trip and was asked to return the same evening to find out whether a trip was possible as they were busy with dives. When we returned that evening we were booked in to snorkel on the Sunday, 5 days later and asked to return the Saturday evening to confirm times.When we visited the shop on Saturday evening despite our names being written on the board the staff did not seem to know that a snorkelling trip had been booked in. It seemed at the time they wanted to say it would not be possible however told us to turn up at 12 o clock on the Sunday and we would then be taken in the trip. When we arrived on the Sunday, again the member of staff that was there did not know anything about the trip and said that boat was not yet available and to come back at 2.30. When we returned at 2.30 there were no staff at all there. After a short while a dive master returned with a student and just said he knew nothing about it and that it would not be possible to do the trip as it was now too late. Throughout our time dealing with Andaman bubbles it was clear that the staff had not communicated with each other. As the Sunday was our last day on the island we were unable to go on a trip despite booking it 5 days in advance. We would have preferred it if they had been honest when we booked the trip and they had just told us the trip would not have been possible and we could have booked with another company. Overall it was a very disappointing experience, the staff did not seem to communicate with each other and no one seemed to know what was going on."
HIGHLY CARING AND PROFESSIONAL STUFF.,Had group of 17 of which 10 dived. Got in touch with AB based on reviews here and sure enough was not at all disappointed. Like entire island they have connectivity issues and email was not the best way to communicate. But once I established contact with Hari on phone it was all smooth.We freezed two dive programme for all.They took really good care of all of us and sites they showed were exotic. The experience was so intoxicating that even two members who suffered some sea sickness en route easily and happily took second dive.Thanks all the staff for great experience and care.
Best dive center,"Andaman bubbles is the best dive center in Havelock! We had really good experience, the stuff is very professional, Mario and Ashwin are the best!!! 😊☀️🏞💙 Maya&Ofir"
Highly recommend!,"We had a great time doing our advanced open water course with Andaman bubbles. All along the course we felt safe and secure. The whole staff were super nice. Our instructur, Mario, was very professional and always with good energy and a smile. Answering our questions with patiant.We really recommend Andaman bubbles for a great diving experience"
The best community for scuba diving on Havelock!,Great prices and incredible instructors! I had such a wonderful experience getting my open water SSI certificate with them. I highly recommend Andaman Bubbles to expert and beginner divers. They are an intelligent team who will teach you all you need to know and take you to the best spots on the islands. Suki is an amazing instructor who worked with me one-on-one for no additional cost to make sure I got my certification on a tight deadline. They will work with you and make sure you also have an amazing experience! Thank you Andaman Bubbles!!
Scuba Experiance,Complete professionals. Team enjoy the job what they are doing and that would again make the Scuba experience memorable.
an excellent experience,I had an excellent experience  and all that credit goes to Andaman bubbles..thankx AB for my unforgettable experience
No doubt the best place with best instructors! ,"It is definitely the most professional scuba diving club in havelock. I heard so much about the place before coming, and wasn't disappointed. My travel partner is well experienced with diving, and agreed that andaman bubbles gave him the best experience. My diving instructor, Mario, was extremely patient and made me feel safe and confident. I'm very lucky to have had him there with me, thank you for everything!"
Excellent,First dive and it was an exhilarating experience. Largely due to a lit team of instructors. The bubble that never bursts. Way to go Andaman bubbles.
Good and comfortable scuba dive,"I visited Andman Bubbles with my wife and booked a beginners scuba dive course ""Boat dive"". First thing I notice in this institute is that they all run by well cultured and trained professionals and they have little proud if it too. the more you pay the better service they will offer. My training was good but I didn't get good accessories for diving they offered torn dive suits and shoes when I asked they ignored saying it is not required at the same time they are offering new accessories to foreign peoples. This I felt bad about them. Underwater photography was not up to the mark. they took pics as if I was diving in a pool."
Down in the ocean,Was a fantastic experience with all that gear and seeing all the corals and your gear is attached with camera to click pics. All those fishes and turtles was the best experience here.
Sandeep kumar shaw,"This is nice resorts from  Havelock Island Beach Resort Andaman Island, India.nice place and all staff good communication and good performance and one lady name is merry lena patra she  is good girl thank u merry and all time corporate that time I like this view and movement  I love this place"
A lifetime experience,"We did scuba there. Me and my wife enjoyed a lot. We did fun drive of scuba. Duration was 4 hours including a theory class at fat martin,Dress change at a adjacent point, they provided head to toe accessories for scuba, journey to the beach point by jeep, familiarisation and basic  trails at shallow water and then main scuba then return to the original point for dress change etc.Trainer accompanied us the whole time under water. They gave us the time needed for familarisation with repeated trails till you are tension free and ready for the fun. You dont need to know swimming for it. And yes ! Saw a colorful and vibrant world down there!!"
Amazing scuba dive course,The perfect place to take a scuba diving course with the perfect company. I'm was very nervous before I arrived but Hari in the office made me feel at ease. I had fantastic tuition from Mario who was the perfect instructor.  I couldn't recommend these guys highly enough and the best activity in India!
Awesome experience ,We done scuba here. Experience was just fabulous. All the people were great. Likely we found some bengalis there. You will be impressed  by their guidance and friendly nature.
Best palce for first dive,excellent trainer and they are helpful and understanding. looking forward to go back soon for my second dive with them.
ANDAMAN BUBBLES with no troubles,"We signed up for the 4 day open water PADI scuba course. Special shout out to Hari, Jack & Suki. They are a fantastic team. Me and my family put our faith in Andaman Bubbles.Professionalism, care and genuine concern like is hard to come by nowadays. The dive masters were spectacular, we couldn't have felt safer and more confident with their attention to detail at each point and their fantastic diving skills.Would definitely recommend this dive shop to anyone looking for a life changing, safe, happy and super comfortable diving/snorkeling experience in Havelock. Thank you for opening up a whole new world to us. It has changed my life -I am coming back this year for my advanced course! See you soon."
"The team of Andaman Bubbles is excellent,careful and fantastic hospitality.",The team of Andaman Bubbles is excellent. All are very careful. I have enjoyed the hospitality. I observed that their team is taking care of all equipment of scuba diving and maintaining very well condition. All of their staff are very nice and providing excellent hospitality.
It was excellent..,Everyone was very helpful n they actually make it possible for me who doesn’t know how to swim....!! Thank u so much andaman bubbles....
Snorkelling trip,Highly recommended!!For Rs1500 per person we enjoyed a wonderful snorkelling trip to an absolutely pristine reef with lots of beautiful fish and perfect visibility. Highly recommended. They have the gear and give you wetsuits and delicious snacks. We found their office at Fat Martin.
Experience of a lifetime executed by professional team,We picked Andaman Bubbles for scuba after recommendation from the locals and found that these guys are the best. This was the first ever dive for us. It takes about 60-90 minutes to get prepared before the dive. They had given us enough briefing and training in shallow waters until we felt confident before we could go into deeper waters. We had one instructor each and also overseen by another senior instructor. It lasted around 25 minutes and trust me it will be an unforgettable experience. Very well done Jack and Team!One suggestion that worked for us is to do a snorkeling activity elsewhere before you go for a dive. The snorkeling kit gives you a feel of breathing underwater which helps.
Great experience learning to dive with Andaman Bubbles ,"My friend and I did the 4 day PADI Openwater course with Ashwin at the Andaman Bubbles dive centre. We had a great time, Ashwin was a very conscientious instructor but also fun. We definitely learnt a lot and left feeling confident to go on and dive elsewhere as well as having had a really nice week. We visited some great local dive sites whilst doing our course packed with sea life."
safe and friendly,my fear to water was taken off with there immense support and guidance. proper safety measure with abundant time was provide to explore sea and enjoy the dive
Good Instructors But Poorly Run,"We recently received our Padi Advanced Open Water diver certification with Andaman Bubbles. While only being certified for 3 years, our instructor, Jack, was top notch. He provided critical feedback and encouragement about how we could improve our buoyancy and breathing. Unfortunately, that’s where our great experience ended. Prior to booking, we had conversed with the manager in depth about the 5 different courses required for the advanced cert and were told that wreck diving and a night dive were both available. Now I understand that diving is always dependent on weather conditions and we would in Havelock 15 days prior to peak season, but our contact’s emails made it sound assured, hence why we decided to travel to Havelock. Upon arrival, we learned that they only had 1 deep sea boat, limiting the ability to travel to the wreck and other numerous dive sites around the island. Additionally, our instructor told us that the night dive was “just ok” and they would have to get special permission (which they hadn’t gotten previously?). We were also intending on doing the Nitrox course and were told, “not possible” as their compressor guy had recently left and they were filling the tanks with a small pony compressor. We let the manager know that we were very unhappy about what we perceived as a misrepresentation of Andaman Bubble’s capabilities.On our second day, the small boat transporting our gear to the beach broke down and hit a reef, resulting in over a 2 hour wait before we could start. When we returned to the shop that night, we were told that our diving the next day would be free. On top of that we recieved a discount, as an apology for the issues.Overall, you can tell that the guys at the shop are doing their best and we appreciated their efforts to try and make things right. However I would be very clear on capabilities/limitations prior to committing to multiple days of diving."
Brilliant experience,"Scuba diving was such a surreal experience and the team at Andaman Bubbles were so so good. They patiently trained and only when they were satisfied, we were taken inside. The photographs taken were also stunning. One hitch is  the journey from the shop to changing to dive spot and then to changing to shop which was a BIT inconvenient but I think it gets forgotten in the experience of it"
Proud to see beauty of our Andaman  and professional service providers,We enjoyed every moment of our scuba experience and also your teams . Very professional and friendly keep it up ...Also proud to see part of India developing as a better tourists destination
Great staff and very professional,Great staff and very professionalHigh quality gearThey take care of everything from safety to snacks on the boat
Best Guide in Havelock Waters,They are experienced with lots of patience. You can go with them with full confidence and peace of mind. Had wonderful experience with them.
Amazing andaman,"Did Scuba with my family for the 1st time in my life,  thanks to Jack & his team, it was an awesome experience of my life time. Gifted this experience to my wife on her birthday. Kudos to your team. Jack!!!"
The place to dive!,"I've done my advanced open water after getting a few recommendations and it was awesome! They are super professional, attentive and friendly and the equipment is in great condition. Those guys are the best 👌"
Scuba diving for novices- A wonderful experience,"I went to Havelock Island with my husband for a short trip. After registering with the Association we were directed to the office of Andaman bubbles near our hotel Dolphin Resort. My husband could not be registered as he was not medically fit to enroll for  the event. However he accompanied me everywhere except under water (:D). The instructors and the other staff were highly supportive and experienced, It was a lifetime experience.  At the age of 60 I could do it with the help of the staff. Special thanks to Jack, Ashish and Manipur Guy (Forgot his name, who was cheering me by his simple jokes like get me a 'macchi'  from the sea) for making my trip happening. Gadgets/ instruments were in very good condition. I didn't know that they had diving masks with power glasses. overall awesome experience."
Nice place. Amazing staff,"Beautiful sea life. Staff professional and very friendly.For sure, ill come back to dive there again!"
Superb,Andaman bubbles was superb. Highly recommend them. One of the best scuba diving team. Expert divers and all.
Best scuba experience,"We had an amazing time with andaman bubbles. Jack and Ashish are amazing instructors, our diving experience wouldn’t have been half as good if it weren’t for them."
Awesome experience ,The experience at this place was really amazing. A lot of foreigners were also seen at this place and is very suitable for photography lovers.
the best trip to relax,there was some problem with the guides sometimes they were strict and rude to us so i request to make out or slove out this problem next time
Scuba diving experience,"Team, I am disappointed with the over all experience of my scuba diving with your team. The diver seems tired and not spent much time under the water with us. Further the diver not took us to deep waters atleast 10 mtrs. We were almost near the water surface and it was like we were doing snorkeling and not scuba. Photographer was just there to finish his job clicking photos any how. Corals and fishes were very less in the area we were diving. Overall not a good experience for us."
Great experience,Well skilled staff . JAak was my instructor and simply awesome. They had good scuba gear and well maintained .
Awesome experience,Had a great time with my friends 👌👌😊😊😊njoyed a lot ; first trip without my parents but they guided us & took proper care & guidance 😊🙏
Very nice expereince,Staff were professional and friendly. Equipment was very good. Great one to One training and dive. Explained in detail about scuba dive and its best practices very well including tips for easy and safe diving.
Excellent service and excellect food,"Excellent service and excellent food. Very safe, well maintained.Staff were very polite and soft spoken"
Excellent experience for a first timer.,"Since it was new and I was with my wife, excitement and anxiety was equally high, they made us believe that it is a simple easy task, nothing to worry about and after the end of 2 hours it was joy, having experienced it well. Being with the fishes and marine life in their habitat, you touch me, i touch you not co existence experience was heavenly."
Nice day,Service level was good and we had a lovely time in the water but the diving spot could have been better.
Awsome experience,"My daughter visited there from her school, The Indian Public School, Coimbatore. She really enjoyed the days with you there. She said ""it was AWSOME""."
awesome,"i did scuba diving and the experience was awesome.... i am afraid of water so could never imagine going through the same, but the hospitality of the trainers made me conquer my fears!!"
"Excellent. Scuba diving by teens. Well organised. Staff very humble, cooperative. Punctual. Extended helping hand. Nice","Excellent. Scuba diving by teens. Well organised. Staff very humble, cooperative. Punctual. Extended helping hand. Nice Photography and excellent videos."
Professional diving center with very nice staff,"They have totally provided us with all information and equipment we needed for our diving trip. Have felt very comfortable with them, can definitely recommend this diving center."
Best in Havelock,If you are diving for the first time please visit only Bubbles. They have one of the best divers and they will make your experience amazing. They are very patient while training you. I cannot think of a single flaw. Me and my husband had an amazing experience. I was very scared and was not sure if i will be able to do but Belgium was very good. Although i did not went deep but he was very encouraging and took me till the depth i was comfortable. Jack and everybody else are very good. Andaman experience is incomplete without you all. Big thanks to everyone at Bubbles.
Pristine and adventurous diving !,"I dived with Andaman Bubbles and was impressed by the genuine hospitality and kindness of the staff at both the dive centre and adjacent resort.As the Andaman islands and Havelock are remote, it means fantastic unspoilt diving!  The reefs at Jackson's, Dixon's and Johnny's are exceptional and, having been lucky enough to dive other 'far away' reefs, I have got to rate these amongst the best few dive sites in the world; these sites are for advanced divers but there are alternative (easier) sites available the less experienced. The boat was great, all our kit was fully rigged, of high quality, and the staff even changed the tanks between dives (but only if we wanted them to).  The 'tween dive snacks of Samosas supplied were great and helped with my ballast.  Guiding was first class and the days seemed to fly by.My biggest regret was only having 3 days available to dive!! However, all 3 days were well worth it.Big thanks to the team who looked after me throughout to enable me to enjoy all the fantastic diving."
Great Dive!,Had a great Dive and lots of fun with Andaman Bubbles!! I hope I get the chance to come back one day! Thanks again! :-)
It was a great experience,I really loved scuba diving experience... it was like I was in another realm... thanks a lot to andaman bubbles team especially to my diving instructor Jack 😊👍
Excellent,"This is my second trip to Havelock Island & I have good memories of this remote, beautiful Island, thanks to Andaman Bubbles & Wild Orchid. Did a DSD with Andaman Bubbles and staff are of great patience to take you through the safety procedures in detail. Within minutes you feel you're no stranger to diving world. The Wild Orchid cottages are simply amazing so are the both restaurants which serves simply the best Indian cuisine. I will definitely back to this Island very soon to dive with Andaman Bubbles:)"
Super Diving at a very remote spot!,"Great and very safe Diving with limited infrastructure!Rental Equipment was super top!Staff super friendly and super helpful!Top Divesites! Some only for experienced divers.Organisation top!Education: top, what I observed (I did not undergo any course ;-) )Thank you guys!"
Great experiance,I took some friends diving on Havelock and they really enjoyed it! It was their first time visiting and diving and they were truly amazed! Best dive center on the island with great professional staff!
Most professional dive school,"For Andaman Bubbles, i dont real see a value added to them through my review,as there are already hundreds of them . They are one of the top three dive schools of havelock and they surely match well to their reputation. A Completely professional team who does not hurry upon things and make you completely enjoy the beauty of under water world. Tyagu, being the senior instructor guides the team very well. When it comes to ladies,their professional approach make them very comfortable and they would not have slightest of discomfort.     We have heard few families in the late 40's thanking them for making their first dive completely memorable.     What else to say people, dont even have to think twice before booking with them. Go and experience the un real beauty of under water world"
Amazing team ,Thank you team Andaman bubbles n special thanks to Gaurav if not for him i would never dive so untill i see u again thank u. Mahesh was also good n very informative thank you guys love u'll
Shore scuba,It's better to pre book now because rules in Andaman have changed ..you have to go to the tourist department to book the dive...its no more direct affair ..if u pre book the dive school will register for you ...all the boat diving has been banned so it's only shore diving ..which was not at all bad ..we could see many corals and schools of fishes ...its been conducted at beach 2 ...try to book for early morning slot ....
Best Scuba Experience,Are you in Andaman Islands and want to experience Scuba Diving? Get in touch with Andaman Bubbles and have the time of your life. The scuba experience offered by them is just amazing.
Scuba,"Guys! You in Havelock Island and wanna Scuba Dive!! Go with ""Andaman Bubbles"".. They are so professional and your scuba experience would be Amazing.."
Jewel of the Andamans ,"Water is more clearer, bluer than the much hyped havelock. Lesser crowd, more scenic. Safe sea at bharatpur beach with decent water activities. Deep sea snorkeling at bharatpur beach - excellent experience. Unfortunately no scuba."
Amazing Experience!!,"Andaman Bubble is a place to be if you want to do Scuba at Andaman. Me and my wife went there and it was the first time we were doing something under water . We both do not know swimming , but still the instructors were so nice that we both went  unto the depth of 10 meters. So amazing professional people and a value for money ."
An awesome dive centre.,"I did my PADI Open Water course with Andaman Bubbles. My booking was through online and they answer all my queries very efficiently despite of the poor internet connection in Havelock Island. My dive instructor, Gaurav is a great teacher and friend. All the staff in Andaman Bubbles are very hospitable. They made my stay in Havelock a memorable one and I will definitely recommend them to any divers seeking for a great time in the island."
Open Water and Advanced Diving Course in one go,"I visited Andaman for scuba diving certification and as a leisure trip this Marcg.  It is the most beautiful place, specially Havelock. Scuba diving experience was surreal. Natural coral reef and the most spectacular marine life! It was my first time scuba diving, directly for certification. I had a wonderful experience thanks to Andaman Bubbles, specifically my instructor Gaurav for Open water course and Sanjana for my Advanced open water course I was a little scared on the last day of my open water course where i got drifted from the boat for my 18 metres dive for certification level, but Gaurav was patient and waited till I resumed my calmness and was all set to take the 18 metres dive for the certification. Sanjana too was patient and the reason I could finish my Advanced Open water course with so much ease.I  stayed at Wild Orchid  which is tied up with Andaman Bubbles, both being adjacent to each other. This helps reduce time involved in traveling for dives or video lectures. The accommodations are simple and luxurious.I would recommend extended stay at Havelock compared to other places in Andaman. Also, Andaman Bubbles for Scuba dives or certifications, specially my instructor Sanjana and Gaurav for being so patient and making my dream come true of being a certified diver.A big name dive shop is not a necessity in choosing for courses or certification levels. What counts are the Instructors. And Andaman Bubbles have a fantastic team of instructors from My instructors Gaurav and Sanjana to Tapu, Thiagu and Gary. They were always ready to answer questions and share their experiences and knowledge. Friendly atmosphere and i never felt i had come alone for the course. It is a must visit place for all scuba enthusiasts and beach lovers!Thanks for making my dream come true of being a diver😊"
Good service. Good team. ,I did my PADI Advanced with AB and continued with some more dives after that. I am very pleased. I had Gary as divemaster on my Advanced course and he is one very good teacher.The crew around the diveteam make diving easy and everything is arranged with bcd+tubes on the diveboat when we got out. Pleasant and safe dives. Equipment was very good. Andaman bubbles is not the biggest divecompany on Havelock and they do more dives than courses I think.
Great Scuba Diving Experience,"We were recently at Havelock and took the Discover Scuba diving package from Andaman Bubbles. We were 4 adults and 3 kids aged 9-11 - and it turned out to be a memorable experience thanks to Rizwan and his team. They made the kids and all of us feel extremely comfortable in the water. Also the best part for me is that they specially arranged  -6.0 power lens in the mask for me, so instead of being half blind I could totally enjoy the marine life - in its true colours and beauty,"
Scuba Diver Course ,"I visited Andaman for scuba diving certification and as a leisure trip with my friends this January.  It is the most beautiful place, specially Havelock. Scuba diving experience was surreal. Natural coral reef and the most spectacular marine life! It was my first time scuba diving, directly for certification. I had a wonderful experience thanks to Andaman Bubbles, specifically my instructor Shaurya. I was paranoid at times, but Shaurya was extremely patient and the primary reason I could finish my course. We stayed at Andaman Galley. Andaman Galley is tied up with Andaman Bubbles, both being adjacent to each other. This helps reduce time involved in traveling for dives or video lectures. The accommodations are very simple and luxurious.I would recommend extended stay at Havelock compared to other places in Andaman. Also, Andaman Bubbles for Scuba dives or certifications, specially my instructor Shaurya. It is a must visit place for all scuba enthusiasts and beach lovers!"
Great Snorkeling Trip!,"We booked a snorkeling trip the day before. The staff was ready on time and picked us up with a truck. Then we drove to the remote beach where the snorkeling/diving hut is - it was very neat and organized with serious gear. We got our equipment and headed to the very nice boat that took us out to a 3 location trip. The captain explained about the underwater life and currents, gave us enough time to snorkel in each location and helped us up and down the boat. Very professional!"
Great just for ticking off from the bucket list.. Discovering scuba is another thing altogether ! :(,"Context : Was at Havelock with a bunch of friends. We hadn't done proper research or booked our dive trip in advance ( In hindsight - the biggest mistake we made ). So, after asking around a couple of places ( Barefoot, etc which were completely booked out ), we had reached Andaman Bubbles.The good : People were nice to talk to initially and even when we were being instructed ( Sanjana was the one doing the orientation ).They have full gear in decent condition ( including wet-suits ).Big Martin ( The restaurant where the center is located ) is a good place to sit and chill.Discount if you were staying at the hotel next-door.The in-water exercises were done decently.Photos and videos were included as a part of the package.The not-so-good : The scuba dive itself felt like a farce. There were 5 of us doing the dive. The entire time we were held and moved around instead of being taught / eased into doing the basic moving around inside the water by ourselves. The dive was advertised and informed to us as being a dive upto 10-12m, where as the actual dive ended up being ~4-6m under the surface. Also, the dive-site was overcrowded as most dive-centers ended up brining their students there, because of which ( Most likely ) the sea-life also was scarce. The primary reason for the low rating is the wrong expectation setting as well as the feeling of being completely commercialized instead of enjoying the scuba experience. If you have done it at any nice place earlier ( most places in the world ), the dive experience would be a disappointment.If you just want to tick scuba diving from your bucket list, without any prior experience, go for it - you won't have a baseline for comparision"
Great staff and experience!,"I went with Andaman Bubbles for my first scuba diving experience, and it was really enjoyable. The crew is super relaxed and friendly, and were very professional during the lead up and actual dive. My scuba instructor was Tapu, who was very encouraging and fun. I'm looking forward to visiting the Andamans again and going with Andaman Bubbles for my scuba certification. Can't recommend them enough!"
Best dive shop in Havelock,"Best dive shop, excellent staff and dive instructors (special mention to Thiagu and Sanjana)They have an excellent boat 'SULTAN' to take you out for dives, fully equipped with food and medical amenities. Do visit for an unforgettable experience"
PADI open water scuba certification:,"My first scuba dive was amazing with great experience, fun and thrilling. All thanks to SHAURYA for making it an unforgettable course. She was an amazing trainer one can ever get😀 Her knowledge, experience and her techniques in teaching us was remarkable. Thanks a lot Shaurya for making it memorable. Lots of love😊"
OW & AA courses,Recently completed the SSI Open water and Advanced adventurer scuba courses from bubbles.All the people i interacted there Shaurya; Mario; Gary; Gaurav; Thiagu ;Sanjana;Suki were really cool people. Dealing with them was more like interacting with freinds. Shaurya was very helpful in resolving all our queries .We were lucky to have Mario as our instructor for both the courses. He had this zen like calm approach but also a perfectionist. With utmost patience made us repeat the drills till we reached some basic competency level.If ever get a chance for further courses will choose Mario and Bubbles for sure.
Amazing Amazing wait.... did​ I say AMAZING!!,"Mario, Shaurya and GaryI'd first like to thank you for being so bloody amazing! My experience of the island was a 10 fold better with you guys as my instructors.Your patience, knowledge and warmth made the advanced learning dive experience a breeze. I'd recommend diving with you to anyone who asks. The dive sites were mindblowing and have majorly peaked my interest and love for the underwater world. Trust me i wish i could live there. Glad that the planet is made of 70% water :DLooking forward to seeing the world with a B.C.D on. Like a backpaper in the under waters 👍Cheers Andaman bubbles team!!"
It was like a dream come true! Bucket list work done well!,"It was the most beautiful and memorable trip I ever had. All thanks to Andaman bubbles for being so cooperative and friendly. All thanks to you guys you made the trip so wild and free! The experience of diving was crazy! I just can't explain the sight of underwater it's so colorful , peaceful and enchanting! It made me think slow and positive. All thanks to my instructor who was immensely professional and hardworking in his work! I wish to wish you guys really soon!All the best and do well!- Anoushka"
A great experience,An item ticked off my bucket list. Thank you Bubbles for making the experience unforgettable. Kudos to Suki for being such a gracious instructor. And beware....this senior citizen is planning to return for the certification course.
"First Dive... Mix Experience.. Mario, the savior!!","My first dive and Mario was the instructor. We started off well but then suffering happened as I kept practising the breath-in strokes while the oxygen flow was off. After 20 mins of trauma, the team realised that they had not opened the oxygen flow. This drill was done by a trainee instructor while Mario and Sonia were only overlooking this nightmare of mine!! After much suffering, and when I was just about to give up the dive, Mario stepped in and then there was no looking back and the dive was an enjoyable experience with Mario."
The colours in the sea go pop!,"For someone who's as obsessed with water as I am, this would be a perfect place to go to when in Andamans. I enrolled for the scuba divers course, and was extremely excited to get certified. Having gone for a fun Dive earlier at Pondicherry, I knew what to except from the course. But the actual experience was quite surreal and different! And that was all due to my instructor Shaurya. She made the lessons interesting and the dives enticing. She was the epitome of patience, considering we weren't the brightest of students one would want. I'm looking forward to advance up further in scuba, and I can just hope the rest of my instructors are as chilled as Shaurya.The vibe at the Andaman Bubbles is lively and the staff is very friendly. We had a blast while we were there. I'd recommend the place for an amazing scuba diving experience, in case you're looking for one. And hope you find the Emerald Gecko when you do visit Andamans!"
The Most Surreal Experience,"I did my PADI Open Water Diver Course with Andaman Bubbles and had the most wonderful experience. Shaurya took me under her wing and was extremely calm and patient till I managed to grasp all the skills and techniques. The entire team of Andaman Bubbles was very warm, friendly and really passionate about what they do. Thanks to Shaurya and the team I had the most surreal experience."
magical experience,"Once was not good enough for me, i had no idea the underwater world could be so breathtaking...i am grateful to all the instructors at andaman bubbles for being patient and making sure the basic skills were perfected before we ventured out...thanks to andaman bubbles my trip to havelock has been a really special one!"
Thank you Andaman bubbles!,I felt so well looked after by the fun and friendly staff and had a great time getting my open water ticket with them. I highly recommend it.
PADI Open Water Diver Course,"I did the Open Water Course with 2 of my friends and our instructor was Sanjana Kapoor. We had the best time doing the course and couldn't have hoped for a better vacation! I really liked the whole team of Andaman Bubbles- really warm, friendly and undoubtedly knew their stuff. I would recommend them, also because their location was perfect, close to Fat Martin's Cafe, Red Lobster, Anju Coco, Full Moon Cafe and all cool places in Havelock, where the night life is vibrant :) Thank you for an amazing experience, Andaman Bubbles and Special Thanks to Sanjana for making our course a breeze and for the amazing pictures underwater :D"
Advance open water course,"Shaurya is a great scuba teacher, she is very confidence inspiring and gives off a relaxed vibe. I went for open water course but i felt so comfortable during scuba later i decided to my advanced open water certification with Shaurya . We did total of 9 dives dives off a dive boat around havelock. The boat was fantastic, best dive boat i've ever been on. We dove 'The wall' and 'Jhonny's george' and went upto a depth of 30mts. At Andaman Bubbles they very flexible and will work around your schedule, I recommend them for any scuba training you may need.The best part about the whole experience was they took us to a recently discovered Dive site called 'Turtle reef'. The only thing we had was the coordinates of the dive site ( the site was discovered previous day ) and searching for that exact spot was an experience of its own. And we are greatful for Shaurya and Mario ( he is the one who discovered 'Turtle reef')."
Certification with Andaman Bubbles!,I had gone for a solo trip to Andaman to get my Open Water Diving Certification done not knowing what exactly to expect. It turned out to be an experience I'll never forget. Sanjana played the ideal host and instructor for the 4 days I was there. She was extremely patient and gave me constant encouragement during the course. I've already recommended all my friends to get their certification done under her tutelage. You're bound to have a great time!
"My personal ""Finding Nemo"" experience with Andaman Bubbles !","The highlight of our visit to Havelock Islands was the scuba diving try dive experience through Andaman Bubbles Scuba Diving at Havelock Island. It had been on my bucket list for years, and thanks to Shaurya and the team at Andaman Bubbles, I realized my dream at the grand old age of 58 years. Shaurya is the epitome of patience and exudes a calm confidence which puts you at ease immediately . Probably you may have never before stepped into te sea, but Shaurya made me feel like a professional with many years of experience!The undersea experience is another dream world and a must do activity for all enthusiasts visiting Havelock. The variety of fishes, octopi,regenerating corals, sea anemones, and clown fish ensured I lived my own ""Finding Nemo"" experience. The training sessions prior to entering the sea were well executed so that even a novice was able to try the diving experience. And then our photos and videos were taken underwater to make it truly unforgettable. Thanks again,Shaurya and Andaman Bubbles team, for such a terrific time in the new world under the sea!"
Super,It was an quite amazing experience of the life.Andaman Bubbles has an extra ordinary team who served us pretty well.
Scuba with Andaman Bubbles. You rock guys!,"Amazing people with a diving passion, great tutors, and became nice friends too! Although this was a little expensive than others but I think it was worth it."
An Amazing first time diving experience,We happened to enroll for the Open water diving course in Andaman Bubbles. I wasn't prepared for the amazing experience I was going to have. The Instructor Shaurya was extremely patient with us. The techniques are set deep in our minds cause she made sure we were doing it right…
Best Scuba Diving Instructor - Padi Open Water + Advanced Course in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,After a lot of research and reading online reviews 4 of us finally decided to do our PADI open water course in Andaman Bubbles in Havelock Island and it turned out to be a great decision. We were interacting right from the beginning with a lady named Shaurya and she was very…
SSI Open Water Course + Advanced course,"We did both open water course and advanced open water course with Andaman bubbles, although just the first one was planned. We loved the experience - our instructor Mario was very experienced, patient, polite, friendly. Mario answered 10000 of our questions - both related and…"
First Dive experience ,Scuba diving was the cherry on the top of the cake in our trip ! Amazing and thrilling experience ! Special thanks to shourya for being an amazing guide in the dive ! Much love 👍🏻
best place best instructors,amazing fun and enriching experience. thank you Mario and all the crew it was unforgattable. Shai Rahamim.
Amazing experience! Great team of professionals!,"It was my first dive this year. These guys made it easy, convenient and nice. Great people, great communication. All the processes are clear and organized very well. Guys also made a photo and video recording for free. Special thanks to Mario and Sudi."
Best Team of Diving Instructors .. Awesome Experience!! ,I visited Havelock with my friends in January 2017 and went Scuba Diving with the Andaman Bubbles Team. We dived at Pilot Reef. Must say they are the most welcoming and professional group of instructors ever.  I dived with Suki and it was an amazing experience. Tapu clicked my best underwater picture. Also special mention to Sanjana and Gaurav for knowing your job so well. You are truly an inspiration.  I will definitely visit again for doing a course with you guys.  Highly recommended.. for a lifetime experience!!
Awsome,It is famous for sea fish .  The white fish was best in the mixed sea food platter . Their nan is also very soft and tasty .
Excellent AOW & Rescue Diver course with Shaurya,"From mid december 2016 to beginning January 2017 I was diving with the amazing friendly, experienced and competent team of Andaman Bubbles. During this time Shaurya was my dive instructor for my Advanced Open Water as well as my Rescue Diver. Since she has been diving for many years at different dive spots it was a pleasure to benefit from her great dive experience as well as from her knowledge about the marine life in this area.Especially the Rescue diver course was quite challenging but because of this Shaurya and the entire Andaman Bubbles team showed us that being a Rescue diver implies an increased responsibility for the dive buddies you are diving with. They didn't only go with us through all the exercises in a normal way but regularly surprised us with a panicking or tired diver when we didn't expect it at all. Those measures were perfect to train the situations that might happen to you as a Rescue diver one day suddenly.Besides the great dive courses Shaurya, Gary and the entire Andaman Bubbles team knew how to treat their customers in a very friendly and personal way. You never felt as a normal customer but more a part of the Andaman Bubbles family.And because of their deep passion for diving they not only made my time a very enjoyable and unforgettable but inspired me to continue with diving and do my dive master in the next months. By that they literally are part of a turning point in my life.Thank you so much Shaurya, Gary, Suki and the entire team for that amazing time and the unforgettable dives.Ben"
Amazing experience with a fantastic team!,"Since it was the 1st such experience for almost all of us in a small group of 7, Garry and his team of highly trained and experienced instructors made the entire trip to Havelock a memorable one with their patient training and excellent arrangement of a fun dive for us. The team is extremely competent, very thorough and excellent in handling a novice, nervous group like us! Was such a surreal experience underwater- a dream come true with this experience of Scuba diving. The Photos and videos they provided post the dive was a great added incentive to carry these memories for ever! Thanks a lot to the team at Andaman Bubbles!"
PADI Open Water & Advanced Course with Shaurya - awesome experience!,"Before choosing a diving school on Havelock, I had a look at different providers and finally went for Andaman Bubbles. Their team consisted of the most welcoming instructors such that I eventually did both the PADI Open Water & the PADI Advanced Open Water courses with them. I spent about 6 days diving and proving a couple of underwater skills to my dive instructor Shaurya, who is a very adorable, patient and knowledgeable instructor. As all the guys at Andaman Bubbles, she knows so incredibly much about marine life that you'll not only see what life deep down looks like, but experience it! I couldn't recommend Shaurya and here team more as they all managed to brilliantly convey their passion for diving and marine life! :) A highlight of my dives: Shaurya and the rest of the team know the dive sites so well that you'll definitely end up spotting some cool stuff like leopard sharks, huge green turtles, napolean wrasses and many more. Havelock is a great place to do so! :)"
Beyond Expectations - Just Great!!!,"I have visited Havelock Island on October 2016, and the best decision I took was to dive at Andman Bubbles!Done there my Advanced Open Water course with the one and only - Shauriya Peedo, an experienced, super clever, Patient and professional diving contructor. The course was Experiential, enriching and fun.Highly recommanded to dive with Andaman Bubbles- great diving crew.Thank you guys!"
Wonderful experience. Recommended,"Dreamed of scuba diving for a long time.. andaman bubbles made the dream come true. Went in december 2016. Tappu, chloe and Mr.T.. u guys r awesome. I was literally swimming with the fish. Finding nemo (and his family) was amazing. So many colorful fishes. Loved the dive. Highly recommended. My Contact was Ms.shaurya on the andaman bubbles website. Thanks a lot shaurya. U guys rock. Period!"
Great Diving ,"Andauern bubbles is a small, but really nice diving center on Havelock. Staff is really friendly, the equipment in good conditions. The center has a cozy cafe attached to it wish great relaxed atmosphere.  My diving course was led by Shaurya, a great dive master, with much experience, patience and good knowledge about the local sea life. She had a great eye for the individual needs to make this advanced open water course an awesome individual experience. Thank you so much!"
The most amazing experience!,"Andaman bubbles is a great diving club, with wonderful team of instructors and pleasant environment. After I did the try dive I decided to do the SSI open water course with the amazing instructor Mario! I was struggling at the beginning of the course and wanted to quit, but Mario didn't give up on me and insist that I will continue. He make me believe that I can do it and I really could, and had a wonderful time under water. when I finish the course I was so glad for not giving up. Mario is very professional, very patient, explain everything clearly and always happy to help with everything you need. Go to Andaman bubbles and ask for Mario as your instructor!! The best in Andaman"
Amazing experience!,"We came to Andaman Bubbles after our friends recomended us to do the open water course and the advanced course at this amazing place. Apparently it was the best decision we took. Although the weather was not very friendly to us, we had great time during this experience, all of Bubbles's people are great, and knowledgeable but the best part was the right to learn from Shaurya. She was so dedicated, allways patient, and super professional. Especially in the fish ID!We definitely would have done it again. And definitely with Shaurya!"
Great Dives!,Dear Rizwan and Andaman Bubbles Team!Thank you very much for unforgettable dives!What you have accomplished at such a remote place is incredible!Keep going like this! Great job!!!👍👍👍👍👍
Awesome Experience,"Shaurya was a fantastic instructor, she made the course interesting and introduced us to the world of Marine life. Thank you so much☺"
Great diving ,I had a great time doing my padi open water and advanced open water courses at andaman bubbles. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable especially Shaurya. It was great going my fish ID with her as she has encyclopedic knowledge of all the fish!
Heaven on earth ,WAAAAAAAY above my expectations. Loved everything on the island. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating to the most demanding clients. Rizwan is a great leader and the dive guides were simply super..  Highly recommended. Will surely come again.
Fun & safe & fun,"Mario & SSI rules!Thank you for the open water course, it was amazing and fun at the same time. Mario is a professional Instractor who knows how to adjust the course to the student perfectly!at November the visebility was not perfect but we still manage to see nice things like a leporedSharke"
Mario- ssi open wate course,Mario is the best guid of open water dive course! Ssi course!Very good!The course is in a fair price.Dive sits are very beutiful!I see a leopard shark!!
Fantastic Experience,"My experience with Andaman Bubbles was amazing. It was absolutely safe, they had all the necessary equipment and gave me proper instructions. Definitely going to do a diving course with them on my next trip!"
Totally worth it !,"We scuba dived as a couple with Sanj and Tyagu as our instructors .It was out of the world ! More than what I could have expected .Gonna come back and pursue the course soon.Highly recommended for the quality and experience gained !! By the way ,I found Nemo as well ! :-) The clown fish playing in n out of the anemone."
My second home (:,"It has been my second year diving with bubbles and I hope to come back every year!The staff is super proffesional and fun to be with. They truly know and understand the dives sites.All my friends enjoyed their fun dives and courses, so thanks guys!"
Beyond imagination ,"Our agenda for visiting Havelock was mainly to certify for the SSI open water dive. We researched a whole lot of dive shops (there are a whole lot on the island), and settled for Andaman Bubbles. The reason being- very professional, very calm and an easy going manner which is soothing. Our designated instructor Mario, is a very systematic and enchanting gentleman who took every step, from setting up the equipment to general maintenance and proper storage. By the end of the first session, we were all in control of our breathing and movements under water (that shows the class of the instructor), and there was no looking back from there on. Thanks Andaman Bubbles and 'Super Mario' for making it a beyond imagination trip for Sona and myself."
Book your Open Water Course already!!!,"I was visiting Havelock Island for some time and as Diving is a main attraction on the island I immediately considered doing an Open Water and Advanced diving course. My resort was not far away from Andaman Bubbles so it was obvious I should check them out.I visited various dive shops to compare prices however what eventually drew me to dive with Andaman Bubbles is the devoted and friendly team of instructors. Even before starting the course I got to know each and every one of them and they were all extremely friendly, enthusiast and professional. It was obvious to me that this is the place I would be able to get the best diving experience....So I started the course with, it's a 6-day course of really deep and personal care.The diving course also included breakfast and some snacks and fruits between dives and lessons.My instructor *MARIO* was very patient and understanding. He was always paying close attention and pointing out how I can improve and do various techniques better, making sure I am safe and comfortable. He is also very knowing and generally a very inspiring diving instructor an person overall.With the course done, I was very happy and confident with my skills, swimming like a fish underwater and very excited about future diving.I simply could not resist and immediately booked another fun dive with Andaman Bubbles so I can have some more fun with the team.Bottom line is that I had an AMAZING and unforgettable experience. I recommend diving with Andaman Bubbles just to support this great dive shop and their team. I am certain you will not regret this.Thank you for everything guys, YOU ARE THE BEST!-Aviv"
Expedition down in the Blue Depths,"Really had an amazing experience with Andaman Bubbles during my trip to Havelock Is.The Scuba instructors were very friendly and took the time to help me refresh the necessary skills needed (I am a certified scuba diver with ANDEs but I was diving after 2 years). They even had a small laminated card which described the different fishes found in the area so that we could reference it any time.  In all, we had a ball of time. Really looking forward to going back and getting a PADI certificate with them."
Stop. Think. Act.    3 words that made me dive!,"The Bubble's team is spot on , very well experienced and friendly team . My Instructor , Garry ... super knowledgable person and an instructor with so much patient and experience , Being Water phobic , i owe it to him to get my over come the fear of water and making sure that not only did i learn Scuba Diving , but also enjoyed the whole process .along with him  other members of Bubbles team, Mario .. Suki .. Zan ( Hooks up the best parties on the island).. Zamir... ..Gaurav ( Also doubles up as a DJ and Bar Tender ) , Sanjana.. These guys are highly recommend. By far a very professional and committed team. PS: If your late for Garry's Class , its 1 beer for every 5 mins . :-) . He has an Army background . haha. They run a nice chill restaurant & bar behind their Dive shop , often host Open Mike nights and theres a music on most of the day . Perfect spot for food too, got some good options on the menu . a must try is the desert "" Hello to the Queen"" . I don't know why they names it, but it taste insane. I have had an amazing time."
Great dive company! Thank you ❤️,"Had a really fantastic few dives with you guys. You're very relaxed, friendly and fun. Equipment was good and high quality and the boat was clean. Boyfriend loved his try-drive and will now be getting qualified so thank you xx"
Best instructor in the world (at least in Andaman),"Came by recommendation to do a SSI diving course with Mario Fernandes and the guy was more than expected. Professional, calm and very friendly. Had a great time diving with him and feel ready to dive alone thanks to his teaching. The only con is that out of 5 diving days, the Bubbles Diving club makes you go to the same spots. But definitely would have done it again. And definitely with MARIO"
Definitely will return for dive course,"I booked my slot for "" DSD (Discover Scuba Dive) "" for 27 Sept 12pm. But the catamaran (Coastal Cruise) got delayed by 8 hrs from Port Blair and finally we reach Havelock at 4:15pm.Went to dive shop at 7pm and met Gaurav, and without any excuse/hesitation he rescheduled our dive for next day at 8am.Gaurav and Mr. T took us to the dive Centre, where we got the kit and complete briefing about the dive program that includes underwater signs, safety tips, respect to marine life etc ..Finally had a dive at Nemo Reef. It was an amazing experience. I didn't realize that was there under water for 27 mins, I just felt like it was for 10-15 mins only. Got to see the Sea Snake, Octopus and Lots of different type of fishes and off course Corals. Got nice pics and videos too. For a non swimmer and first timer, it was just a WOW experience.Thanks a ton to Gaurav and Mr. T. Will definitely return for dive course, once our kid will be more than 5."
Scuba diving,I had an amazing experience with Andaman bubbles..these guys are really awesome experienced especially thanks to shourya for the patience n motivation..she made my dream come
"Awesome Staff, Really Nice Dive Center","I spent a couple days on Havelock, diving with Andaman Bubbles, and had a really great time! The staff we're awesome - friendly, knowledgeable, and fun, and also flexible - they were able to arrange my diving to make it all work even when I had some trouble getting the ferries (note: it can be touch to get tickets on and off Havelock). Diving was really nice - I've heard the best stuff is by far the deeper dives, but at Open Water level, there are some nice reefs, and especially the fish life is awesome."
Scuba diving-unexplored world,"I have done scuba diving in Oct 2 along with my friends at Andaman bubbles.Trust me it's  really an amazing place for first time divers.Big Cheers to the whole team especially Shourya ,Suki n Rizwan .you  guys have been extremely patient and your passion is very infectious and it has opened up an all new world for us."
Amazing Experience!!,"It was such a great experience. We went with the ""Discover Scuba Diving"" plan as none of us tried Scuba before. Now I definitely want to go back and do the certification course as well. A special thanks to Shaurya for being so patient :)"
perfect for kids,"we were diving with our 3 sons and they made perfect arrangements for us. Let them play under water, but also tought them things!"
Surreal scuba experience,"Well, they were affiliated to the hotel I was staying in but wasn't sure if I should go with them or not. Having said that I am really happy to have chosen them for my scuba experience. The trainer I guess was very knowledgeable and calm and composed without any rush. During the training too he was very patient with me. The equipment and all the other accessories was also new, clean and of good quality. I think it was one of the best 50 minutes of my life.."
Best experience ever,It was the first time that I did snorkelling and scuba diving and it was an awesome experience which I will cherish forever..Will sure come again for the full course this time.
Amazing diving with amazing people,"The staff here are great, knowledgeable and fun to dive with. We did about 12 dives with these guys, and everyone one was amazing. Especially as we got the first sighting on a whale shark since last year. It was unforgettable. Thanks guys ☺"
Best place for SCUBA Diving,"If you go to Andaman, SCUBA is a must do activity and would strongly recommend Andaman Bubbles. The instructors were really cool and gives you a sense of confidence."
Amazing Experience!,"It was my first scuba experience , actually my first time under water experience. I had aqua phobia which I wanted to overcome before turning 28. So on 13th September 2016 I finally took the plunge and dove with Shaurya and Mario ( I beg your pardon guys, if I misspell your names) , instructors from Andaman Bubbles. I do not even know swimming , but the instructors were very professional and encouraging. They helped me to over come my fears. It was a life changing experience for me. Apart from the colorful fishes and flora under water, I saw a Banded Sea Krait Snake, which really elevated the entire experience.  I cannot thank  Shaurya and Mario enough. If you are in Havelock Island, do visit their dive shop ( attached to Fat Martin Cafe) and experience the amazing underwater world. All you got to do is trust your instructor and follow their instructions. I enjoyed a lot. I am sure I am gonna return and dive again. Kudos to the entire team of Andaman Bubbles."
A great experience,"It was out first scuba experience , instructors at Bubbles were highly professional. The equipment used was good the instructors went out of the way to make our experience memorable"
"Completed the Open Water Course at Andaman Bubbles, couldn't be more satisfied!","This is the second time I have been to Andaman Bubbles. The first time was three years ago, and it has left a good impression on me that I have decided to complete my open water diving course at the same dive center! Great staff, extremely helpful, and you leave the place with new friends - instead of just a commercial endeavor! I would have liked to complete further certifications if I had the time..Special thanks to my instructor, Shaurya, who not only taught me the techniques of scuba but taught me to identify and learn about what I am seeing underwater. Thank you for further fueling my passion and inspiration to dive and explore our sister world. I am forever grateful!"
The greatest experience,"We had so mach fun doing the open water course, the advanced course and one more fun dive in Andaman Bubbles, the best staff we could have ask for, had the best time in Andaman!"
Excellent Diving and Team,"My daughter and I are qualified Divers ( She is OW and I am Rescue ).We dived at Andaman Bubbles in August , which is supposed to be Monsoon Season , which has an effect on visibility and availabilty of Dive sites.Andaman Bubbles were quite open and upfront about the impact that this may have on our dives , but we were blessed by very good weather and even better diving.Gary ( instructor ) suggested that my daughter did the deep Adventure dive which would allow her to see some of the better sites around the island - Good Call!!So off we went.Their kit is good and well serviced and the boat is powerful ( twin 250 Yamahas ) with a generous covered cabin for sun protection.We arrived at the dive site Dixons Pinnacle, and Tara and Gary did their deep adventure training whilst I bimbled around.After the training we finned around the pinnacle before surfacing.After a suitable surface interval we dived the pinnacle again , Gary pointing out many fish , eels and a Lobster or two.We subsequently dived again the following day at Jonnys with Taipu ( DM ) who has seemingly xray vision for spotting sealife.We saw two white tip sharks , Turtle , Stingray( I think ) , a large ray , Giant Moray Eel and more fish than you could shake a stick at!!On the last day we dived at the Lighthouse , a fairly shallow dive  but fairly Interesting.In summary , very good diving ( Better than the Maldives according to Tara ) , a really professional and interested team , who spoke very good English ( important for me as my Indian Linguistic abilities are nil!!) , with quality and well maintained equipment.As an added bonus , the Dive shop is based at Fat Martins Café/bar , which serves brilliant food , cold coffee ( for pre dive ) and cold beer ( post Dive ).Thoroughly recommended."
Best exp at scuba ,"Very caring and best for scuba diving. Minimum rate, provides certificate also. My experience really very good and lifetime achievement"
Looking for right words:),"Having visited many cities around the world Havelock Island is now most favorite destination. The first thing you notice as you off the ferry is that the crustal clear water and you get connected to the nature pretty much immediately. Took a boat trip with Adamant Bubbles to the dive destination ' Dixon' and it was amazing. My friend dive at Dixon and her first word is ' fantastic', amazing:) Very processional & friendly staff - Riz, Garry, Gogo, Tippu & Thagarajan (Tigau). We stayed at Wild Orchid for 7 nights .....very nice and clean huts which makes you feel home away from home. Staff of the resort are very friendly and helpful. The best part of Wild Orchid and Andaman Bubbles is the their Restaurants ' Fat Martin' and another one which serves 'SUPER' delicious food especially the fish items' Just mouth watering:). Beautiful beach is just 1 minute walk away from Wild Orchid which guarantees you the peaceful atmosphere throughout the day. The morning walk on this beach and the midnight swim at this beach is something I will cherish forever:) Overall, one of the best place in my list and look forward for my next trip to this beautiful, peaceful Island."
"Beautiful,serene,peaceful",It's a beach resort with beautiful bamboo huts and an excellent cafe to cater to the visitors staying there. You can have your breakfast gazing at the blue waters in the sea and maybe go for a swim later.
Amazing trip,Amazing and unique trip! Fantastic dive sites and friendly/professional diving staff! Will be back in september for more fun dives 🐳🐬🐟🐠
' Lying low' under incredible blues!,"Andaman Bubbles has given me something I cannot ever express in words. They led me to the bottom of the earth, into the blues, that contained the magic, that runs every single day in the universe! Beautiful, colourful creatures, hustling about their own lives in peace. The sound I heard was only bubbles. I did my first dive with them and trust me, it took my breath away! The very friendly and brilliant Thiyagu - dive instructor -, Gaurav and Tappu were my mentors during my tyrst at Nemo Reef. My snorkelling was conducted Thiyagu (a sharp, swift, brilliant man from Tamil Nadu). He has done about 2000 dives in his life and wishes to pursue his PH.D in Underwater Archaeology. So, you can well imagine how amazing my experience was. He had every answer below the ocean. Knew every fish by heart, their patterns, the movement of the waves, the unpredictability of the currents. It was wonderful to snorkel with this genius. My diving was conducted by the friendly Gaurav and the simple islander but swift dive master, Tappu. They made it easy, comfortable. I almost swam like a fish under their guidance. A highly professional team, experienced and easy-going. Dive with Andaman Bubbles and find out why my review had to be this long!"
Scuba open water diving,Well we have planned this trip perticularly for scuba course. They are the best for it. ..very cooperative trainers and staff. Specially we are thankful to Mr.Tyagu.I was not eligible for open water because they ask for doctor's certificate as I have blood pressure n diabetes. But my son has completed open water diving course n he dived 18m.
Best place on the island,Best dive shop! Literally went there everyday and met such amazing people. Kindest staff and a very good vibe place
Best dive school!,We loved our time with Andaman Bubbles! The dive instructors were amazing and we felt very safe in their hands. The diving itself was so good too! Highly recommend this school!!!
A super experience!,"This was our first time in the Andaman Islands. My friend and I were looking at a place that would make our first dive a memorable one. After having met a few dive shops, we zeroed in on, Andaman Bubbles Dive Center,right next to our resort, the Wild Orchid. The first thing that strikes you about the place is how friendly the people are.The team at Andaman Bubbles gave us our first dive experience and boy was it awesome!! Professional, understanding and patient, their instructors are informative, experienced and friendly :) we did a total of 3 ( Discover Scuba Diving) dives with them and each one was amazing. Needless to say, I will go back to them when it's time for a course."
From the Bubbles Addicted,"Went there to take my open water SSi and, course, stayed for Advanced. How is it possible not to stay.. This increadible friendly shiny atmosphere. Thank you, Riz, for your work. Thank you guys, friends, Suki, Thiyagu, Mario for being smiling all the time.Now how to love without diving?"
Great scuba diving school,"I passed my advanced open water with andaman bubbles. Very friendly and competent team, perfect english speakers and modern gear. One of the few scuba diving schools operating with a cabin boat, which is comfortable since the interesting diving spots are between 40 and 60 mins off-shore. The equipment room is at the southern end of the east-side beaches, next to Silver Sands Resort. One could go there directly to spare the SUV ride from their office."
"Zindigi naa milengi dubara,,,Discover SCUBA","This dive shop is next to Orchids , very close to Dolphin resort. They offer different courses in scuba , but we, me and my two daughters did ,""discover scuba"" , we had planned to do it twice, on two different days. The first time the water was very clear , we had absolutely no previous experience of Scuba, we enjoyed it thoroughly, the very thought that we were about 10 meters under water was thrilling, we saw some common fish and a octopus, (its like when one goes birding first time and we see , crows, black kite , common myna, parakeet,etc,), but when I read others reviews and they say they saw ""shark"" , etc,they probably were doing the course and definitely diving in a different site.The instructors are very good and know their job, Sanjna, Tapu, Taegu.My advice to anyone reading this review, and planning to do SCUBA in Havelock would be , chose and select your dive shop carefully ,based on how professional are the instructors , what is the quality of the gears they will use, dont let the charges be the main criteria. What ever little study I had done before choosing this place , I can say there are about three places from which you should chose, I selected Andaman Bubbles and was proved to be the right choice."
Incredible time!,"Did my open water SSI and stayed for the Advanced Course as well, got to know many of the instructors, all of whom are incredibly nice and very experienced. Felt very well taken care off, amazing first dive experience!"
Fun Dives,"!thank you for agreat experience, I had so much fun the crew is very professional with a lot of patience, and the dive sites were beautiful I saw Sharks! :pI recommend doing fun dives with the bubbles !! :)ממליצה בחום!Nini bat-segal"
Best dive-shop on Havelock,"When I first arrived on Havelock I knew I wanted to dive but had no idea which dive-shop to go to so I went to a few and compared the dive experiences I found that my dives with Andaman Bubbles were in all the best locations (Johnny's Gorge, Dixon's Pinnacle and Minerva's Ledge)I saw turtles, guitar sharks, leopard sharks and huge numbers of all kinds of fish life, I can't name them all in this article as it would take me hoursEnjoy the community vibe at Fat Martin Restaurant and chill out with other divers whilst eating good food"
Excellent team work,"The whole team is absolutely awesome. Anshuman leads the pack and abhimanyu mario sohit gaurav thiagu with sanjana are some of the key team members .They know the stuff well and are well trained to navigate tough waters. They are not always sweet when it comes to teaching but they get it done,. I got my OWC through abhimanyu and if it were not for his push and strict disclipline i probably would have struggled. They are spending whole day at fat martin so even after the dive its always possible to have a quick discussion on dives on their lives and the place in general.thanks AB team for such a great expericence,PS - Have given them feedback the they need to take more snaps underwater and may also need adequate staffing if there are lot of tourists"
Fun Dive,"It was really a pleasure to dive with the crew of Andaman bubbles, Its a different environment altogether when diving with andaman bubbles & its crew. They are the  most jovial, helpful crew and keeps the trip more lively. Special Thanks to Mario Fernandes for his help & support. Hopefully, looking forward to my next dive @ Barren Island with Andaman Bubbles."
Havlock Islands,It is better to stay one day & night on the island. Ferry are available from Port Blair to Havlock and back .Morning sunshineview  from the sea shore is amazing . sea shores are very neat and clean . Sea food is available .but one may not have much choice of the food. Havlock island is very nice to stay -it is very calm and quiet.
A Heaven of Beaches...,Hevelock Island is one of the finest island of andaman and its Radhanagar beach is very beautiful of white sand ... and in cleanliness i never seen such an island...
"Advanced open water with Abi, great guy great diving","I contacted this dive school prior to arrival and they helped me to buy some equipment. They allowed me to get this shipped to them on the andamans. All the staff I had contact with were great. The diving was excellent even though conditions weren't optimal in October. The deeper sites are really where it's at, Rays, sharks and huge turtles amazing soft coral the list goes on."
Surreal experience,Saying I was apprehensive going 9mts under water in the middle of ocean will be an understatement. I was terrified but Andaman bubbles made my first diving experience a fantastic experience. So much so I can't wait to go scuba diving again. Gaurav our instructor was very friendly and understanding. We took our time learning tips in shallow water and when it was time for the real thing he was constantly by our side making us feel comfortable. Andaman bubbles having padi certified instructors gave us confidence. Their are other places which may offer cheaper services but your life depends on your instructor so you don't want to take any chances. Corals were actually bleached but that's something which has happened through out Andaman still Scuba diving is an awesome experience. Each one has to do it at least once in lifetime.
Lovely place,"I visited Andamans just a few days back with my best friend. We are two girls. We just got back two days ago but the beauty of the place still mesmerises me. On our first day in Havelock, we went to ask about scuba diving (first dives for us both) rates at many places and andaman bubbles was one of it and especially to check whether it was possible to dive the next day. We met few dive masters that day. Abhimanyu and Ayushman (not sure of the spellings) explained to us in detail about how it was all gonna be. After we were given some discount for staying at one of tehir properties, we decided to take the dive from andaman bubbles. It was a lovely experience and I'd definitely go back again anyday for another dive or probably a course on it. they also have a cafe called Fat Martin Cafe, which serves good food. We had an amzing time at Havelock and most times we ate at this place. You should definitely give a try."
have a try...,i didnt try my scuba here but i heard it was good... they have restaurant and the food is good... while having my food here got some good reviews from the foreigners.
Andaman,"The Andaman Islands are an archipelago in India’s Bay of Bengal. These roughly 300 islands are known for their palm-lined, white-sand beaches, mangroves and rainforested interiors. Surrounded with coral reefs that support marine life including sharks and rays, they're destinations for scuba diving and snorkeling. They're also popular for water skiing, windsurfing and fishing. Oceanside camping and hiking is possible on some islands."
Exotic Andaman,"During my schooldays, we had to write Essays as part of the curriculum and I remember my father helping me in writing those long essays which was always a tough thing to remember and pen down. Still I remember a part from an Essay “Bhraman” where my father wrote – “it’s not necessary someone has to travel long distance to enjoy the beauty of mother earth.  Morning sun rays falling on a paddy field in winter when the grass is still wet with morning mist can too bring captivating joy and happiness”. This year, we were not sure where to go after Durga Puja and in September also we were battling and not being able to decide. Suddenly this sentence from my old schooldays came to my mind and in search for this joy and romance, we finally landed on Andaman. The first view of cluster of islands from GoAir G8-101 took us to a different world and I thanked myself for choosing Andaman as our destination. Andaman has 325 islands which cover an area of 6,408 km2 (2,474 sq mi), with the Andaman Sea to the east between the islands and the coast of Burma. North Andaman Island is 285 kilometres (177 mi) south of Burma, although a few smaller Burmese islands are closer, including the three Coco Islands. The Ten Degree Channel separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Island to the south. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island (Saddle Peak at 732 m (2,402 ft)) Andaman has been a centre of attraction for various things starting from virgin beaches of Radhanagar, Elephant, Laxmanpur, beautiful islands like Havelock, Ross, Neil and Viper Island, variety of Water Sports like Scuba Diving, Sea Walking, Snorkeling, Tribes like Jarawa and above all the infamous Cellular Jail. This land witnessed the barbaric punishment our freedom fighters went through during British period which one can understand and partly imagine during the light & sound show in Cellular Jail. But today, except the history which people of the land still mourn, Andaman has become an important Tourist Destination of the world. The beautiful amalgamation of Sand, Land and Sea can take you to a world beyond imagination.After we landed in Port Blair, our guide took us to hotel TSG Emerald where we quickly refreshed and started our journey to Viper Island. Viper Island is a small island which was used by the British for carrying out capital punishment. This small island derives its name from the vessel `Viper' in which Lt. Archibald Blair came to Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1789. The vessel, it is believed, met with an accident and its wreckage was found near the island. Another story says that the name originated from the presence of vipers, snakes, on the island. In any talk about Andaman and its role in the freedom struggle, it is the Cellular Jail that finds frequent mention. But, many years before the Cellular Jail was constructed, it was the jail at Viper Island that was used by the British to inflict the worst form of torture and hardship on those who strove to free the country from the British rule. The cemented beam where from the convicted were used to be hanged still cries out the agony and helplessness which gives goosebumps.While coming back, we cherished the view of succession of ships of different kinds along the harbor. Port Blair being the nucleus of the entire islands, dozens of ships from the mainland anchor everyday with necessary supplies for further distribution to various islands. In the evening, we enjoyed the Light & Sound show at Cellular Jail. One must visit the cellular jail during morning hours to see the star shaped jail. It is one of the places that vividly depict the freedom struggle, the stories of those known and unknown fighters. The jail's one part is opened for tourists and rest have been converted into medical office and for other purposes. From the top of the jail you can see the entire Port Blair surrounded with green and dark blue water. The sound and light show is fairly a good one in the voice of the veteran actor Mr. Om Puri. It is a must watch destination for anyone visiting Andaman. After watching the Light & Sound show, we dined and packed for tomorrow.  We are going to board “Makruzz” from the Jetty and destination is Havelock Island.Havelock Island is a popular destination among the water sport lovers and the main tourist destination with an area of 113.93 km2 and is the largest of the islands. Havelock is situated 57 km North East of Capital City Port Blair with mostly Bengali settlers. It was a 3 hours journey from Port Blair. We put our foot on the white sand of Havelock at around 11 am and rushed to hotel Symphony Palm. The island has a lot of resorts by the beach to cater to the tourist with all food and beverage facilities. However if anyone expects WI-FI and internet, it’s a challenge to get an uninterrupted connectivity.The beauty of Havelock islands is beyond description. The white sand, blue water, virgin beaches, series of trees some of which date back to thousand years as per Carbon Dating can bring a feeling beyond explanation. Entire day we just enjoyed the Sea. In the evening, we went to Radhanagar beach and enjoy the sunset. Gradually darkness fell over the island. The beauty of Havelock beach during night is beyond explanation. The deserted beach, the non- stop sound of the sea water pounding on the rocky beach, whisper of the wind, the dazzling moon, and the glittering stars amazed me. Symphony Palm Resort is a fairly good hotel with airy spacious cottages, restaurants, bars spread over both the sides of the road. Though our room was on the other side of the road, just to be in the vicinity of sea, spending some extra bucks we took a cottage on the beach side. Hotel staffs were friendly and mostly Bengalis. We were served with some delicious delicacies accompanied with some local fish which was indeed mouthwatering. Post dinner, we cherished the mysterious beauty of the beach for some more time before going to bed. Tomorrow, we will be going for Scuba diving in Elephant beach.Today we first went to the place where from we need to take all our necessities for the scuba diving. Scuba Diving has been a dream for me for years and I was excited to see my dream coming true. Unlike other modes of diving, which rely either on breath-hold or on air pumped from the surface, scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, (usually compressed air),allowing them greater freedom of movement. In Andaman, number of areas in the sea is full of corals which attracts sport lovers from around the world. The guides who accompanied us were all experts with years of experience in diving and briefed us about the DOs and Donts. I did diving earlier with air pumped from surface in Pattaya and was aware of the pros and cons and quickly understood the art of this kind of diving which is new to me. Within no time, we started our boat ride and reached the place where the diving to take place. The dive duration is 30 minutes to a maximum depth of 18 meter where you can see different sorts of corals reef and marine life.  Coral Reef is a beautiful creation of nature which is comprised of living corals growing on top of the skeletal structure of dead corals. Each species has a particular coloration and structural complexity which distinguishes that species from others. The living coral itself is an amalgamation of polyps which feed on plankton at night and photosynthesize during the day.  However the marine life was not so exciting due to less variety of species. Still I must say, it was a value for money and worth spending half day. In Havelock you can hire motorbikes, bicycles etc to roam on the island and I really wanted to enjoy a ride to the inner part of the island which otherwise is not coming in the itinerary. the Hero Honda made motorbike ride to the interior of the island  turned our to be a thrilling one when darkness started to fall and I found myself alone on the 8 ft deserted streets of Havelock with one side covered with thick forest. I rode for around 12 km and found a Tea Stall and enjoyed the last few golden rays before the run settled down in the horizon. Honestly I was worried thinking about the road I have to take while going back due to various kinds of fauna in the jungle which sometime do not mind coming to the street to experience the human existence. However I had no option but to start and so did I. Driving a motorbike through such a deserted forest while listening to the natural jingles of the forest, the background sound of cricket took away my little bit of fear that I had before starting and I reached the hotel. Havelock has a small market with various apparels etc mainly getting delivered from the mainland. We spent later part of the evening in the market. A little rain made the weather cool and we felt alive after a hectic day. Dinner was as usual with local delicacies and fishes. We could feel a sense of ending as only two days are left for our vacation to get over. Tomorrow we will move to Neil Island and port blair the next day and then to Kolkata.Neil, with its very relaxed vibe and long, deserted beaches is a place to chill out after the ""bustle"" of Havelock Island. Neil Island is named after James George Smith Neill, a British soldier who had sternly dealt with the insurgents during the suppression of the 1857 Mutiny. It occupies an area of 18.9 square kilometres (7.3 sq mi). The island is located 40 kilometres (25 mi) north-east of Port Blair. This is also an island mostly populated by Bengali who are mainly residing in five villages – Sitapur, Bharatpur, Neil Kendra, Lakshmanpur and Ram Nagar. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the villagers, and the island supplies vegetables to the rest of Andaman. There are a handful of restaurants and basic beach hotels that cater to international and domestic tourists. We reached the island at around 11 am and was escorted to Tango Beach Resort. We liked the bamboo cottages erected on the high platform so to keep away snakes and reptiles from entering the cottages. Apart from the beaches and a Natural Bridge, there is hardly any other place to see in Neil Island when seen from a materialistic point of view. However for me at least, the island has lot more to offer. We went to Sitapur and Lakshmanpur beach and then to the Natural Bridge which is a small strip of land that connects the mainland to a small (3*3) island of sorts. The long walk on the corals was difficult and one has to walk very cautiously so as to avoid any sort of injuries. After returning to the resort, we walked down to the Sunset point which is the west most point of the beach. Due to cloud, we could not fully cherish the sunset. While coming back, we experienced the High-tide which gradually had eaten away the 50 mtr beach and water started reaching almost the edge of the Resort. There are some uprooted trees scattered on the beach which became our evening destination. In such a night with dazzling moon above us and water flowing below those fallen trees and washing our feet, we enjoyed our evening snacks and drinks. This resort organizes night fishing where small boat takes you to the interior of the sea and in case you succeed to catch some fishes, the hotel guys will cook it for you once you come back. Amazing !!Early morning, we moved around the island and went to the Jetty to board the cruise for Port Blair. We reached at around 6 pm and spent the evening roaming around the city. After such a hectic day, an early dinner with beer is always a mood changer. Post dinner, we started packing our luggage…….tomorrow we have Go Air G8-102 to catch for Kolkata…a sense of ending engulfed us ...I do not know should I term it as an ending or a new beginning - a new beginning in search of next destination...till then good bye..."

Scuba for Life!!!,"Forget about other dive centers, When it comes to scuba these guys will give an experience which will blow you away. I dived on 28th July with my dive mate Dustin from California. It was my first dive so I was a bit nervous but our instructors (Thigayu and Tappu) helped me overcome my fear and then we went 1.5 km in the sea and back-flipped into the sea. Wow what a dive it was, I saw a reef shark in this first dive. I seriously want to thank my divers (Thigayu and Tappu) for being patient and supportive throughout. Will come back soon..."

"If you want to scuba in Andamans, these are your guys!","This review is long overdue. My friends and I were in Havelock in Jan, the weather was unexpectedly stormy, but the folks at Andaman Bubbles made sure we had a super dive experience. It was my second scuba experience and it was far better than the first. The team is fun and you should trust them blindly. Hope to go back for a certification some day."
“Unforgettable experience!!” ..............One Word .AWESOME,"I was amazed to see life underneath and it's addictive. All the dives are well managed with the trained staff and executed smoothly. I had wonderful experience. Thank you Tappu, Ayushman and Sanjana ....... for the awesome life time experiences.........."
Havelock Island,Can be termed as heart of andamans. A peaceful place. 0% crime. Helpful locales. Radhanagar beach is awesome. You can hire scooterates @ Rs 400 per day. Sea Shell is the best place to stay. Good place for scuba. Clean beaches. A must must place to visit.
Good place for Scuba,"Nice place if you want to try your Scuba skills. Our instructor, Zanskar, was also very friendly. We also got a discount since we were staying at a nearby hotel. Only problem is that the changing rooms and the dive site is far away from each other and one needs to travel that distance wearing the wet scuba suits."
in love vid havelock :)),"it was an amazing trip to this island and amazing ppl out there....! the scuba diving was wat v explored with andaman bubbles.... glad to meet subhash and tipu our instructors, watta experience it was... do go to havelock and must visit this place! :) tanya:)"
So many fish!,"Excellent facilities and boat, friendly and competent instructors who knew dive sites well. Great to have a place attached to a cafe as well for breakfasts and lunches."
Excellent Dive Center,"I had been diving in havelock in the last few season.This is the first time Iam diving with andaman bubbles.By far cheapest ,safest and friendly dive center.Dive masters and Instructors are friendly and accomodative.They are never in urgent.Very relax and give you enough time to get ready for the dive.All are young instructors but very knowledgable guys.I done my advanced open water course with them ,I am highly satisfied.Special thanks to Subhash,Thiyagu,Galiat ,Sithara and Abhi.My wife was not a comfortable diver ,but the confidense given by Mr.Subhash made her to do her referesher and open water dive.Good quality dive equipments and very good speed boat"
Good Service,"Andaman & nicobar islands was a idol place for me who is at his late 50’s. I was personally looking for some place where I could just go and relax with my wife far away from the stressful atmosphere. As I was planning my second honeymoon and trust me I felt like being in heaven the beaches here are so crystal clean A perfect place for a second honeymoon. It was a amazing feeling people living here are very friendly and helpful. I loved the view from my hotel. Food here was just wow. The tour manager was very helpful and he took care of everything from start to the end thank you , especially my wife who has arthritis, and has difficulty walking. He made extra efforts for meals, and saw to that they were not too spicy. Thomas cook you really have some great managers out there!"
Awesome experience,"It was a great experience diving with andaman bubbles.. It was my first time and I had done the discover scuba open water dive. The instructors were fun and the experience was memorable. Btw, Don't miss out on the amazing food at the Fat Martin's Cafe.."
Good timez,"I had gone with few friends.Had been to lighthouse and the wall (off the lighthouse). Depth 22-28 mtrs. Tyere were some showers day before. Although the clarity of water(5-10 MTR only) was not great, we could still see lot of sea life. Underwater currents were strong. The instructors were very helpful."
"Good dives, amazing dive center",By far the cheapest and more friendly dive center on the Island. Thank you Gaurav for the nice experience and company!
Fun diving!,"I had a lovely experience with Andaman bubbles and divemaster Gaurav. The ultimate test for most dive companies is how they deal with complications on a dive, and they did extremely well. I had trouble equalising on my first two dives, and had to surface. The divemasters on the trip were understanding and patient, and the company itself gave me a discount without me asking since I couldn't dive. I went on to do four more dives with them, and were mostly great dives. I didn't see any big sharks or mantas but it isn't in the power of divemasters. I only would recommend other companies cause they might offer a wider variety of sites with less diving crowd."
Excellent People. Highly recommended.,"We found them while having our snacks at Fat Martin's cafe. They provided good information about Scuba and cleared many of our doubts. Even then I decided not to go for it as I am not very comfortable with water. However my wife chose to do diving with them and her experience was awesome. Her instructor Subhash Chandran was very nice and helpful and he made the diving a very simple and great experience for her. They were so nice that they even allowed me to go with them to the dive site. And while there was no space in the van, another nice guy Tapu gave me ride on his bike...These people are very professional and will make your diving experience an unforgettable one..."
Great 1st experience !,"I never experienced scuba diving. A holiday stay in Havelock just close to Andaman Bubbles made it possible. It has been one of the best experience in my life : clear blue water, amazing fishes, instructors taking a smilling care before, during and after diving...Wow, one of my best reason to go back to Havelock."
The 'Experience' dive is an experience you should not miss.,"Every single person I spoke to recommended that I try Scuba diving in Havelock. I did, and it is one of the most cherished memories of my trip to Havelock. The guys at Andaman Bubbles are excellent underwater guides. I'm planning to do the diving course with them the next time I go to Havelock."
Review of Discover Scuba Diving by Andaman Bubbles,"My experience was awesome. The instructors took good care before, during and after the dive. The dive was pretty easy as in this program you dont need to jump from the boat but instead you slowly go inside the sea. They first pick you up from their restaurant and take you to a place where you can change, then you are taken to the dive site. The basic instructions which are necessary are explained well and then one instructor takes you into the water and all you need to do is breathe and observe the world inside sea. They also take pictures and sometimes video if the visibility is good.To sum up, it was a great experience."
Unforgettable and Memorable Holiday,"We had shortlisted Andaman as our holiday destination because of the pristine waters and host of under sea activities that it offers and we are glad to have chosen Andaman Bubbles to introduce to the underwater world. My wife was a bit nervous (actually a lot) as she doesn't know swimming (neither I am an expert) but our instructors Subhash and Tappu were extremely courteous, friendly and patient to make us acquainted to techniques of scuba diving so that we are extremely comfortable underwater with our whole focus solely on enjoying the beauty of underwater world. Not to forget out dive photographer Jonathan who told us lot about scuba diving and science behind it enroute the dive site and clicked some great underwater shots which ensured that our mesmerising experience stays with us for a long time to come..Thanks again to Subhash, Tappu, Jonathan and whole team Andaman Bubbles.."
Best Dive Experience,"We did a 1day DSD course with Bubbles. The instructors are very good and pay careful attention to all your problem during the dive, making it a risk free amazing experience. Planning to take a course with these guys!"
The Best Dive Crew,"I did a total of 13 dives with Andaman Bubbles during my 8 day stay in Havelock. An excellent dive shop with great instructors. I did a refresher course, my advanced PADI and 3 days of fun dive. Its was a fabulous experience and a special mention to Thyagu (my instructor and their very own marine biologist) and Abhijeet. Would love to go back and dive with these guys again."
Completed my SSI open water diving course,"We decided to check out this place as it was recommended by the Emerald Gecko manager. Three of us were cam to dive together. Thiyagu was our instructor, who is excellent, patient, very relaxed in his approach, very confident and takes the time out to re-explain things. He is not too talkative, but is very good with his work. We also interacted with Rizwan, Abhijit and Subu, all of whom are very confident with their skills, and also loads of fun. For the course, Thiyagu made sure we practiced gearing up enough times before we actually got into the water. Even when I panicked the first time, he was very relaxed and calmed me down quite fast. He was able to manage three non-divers and we all have been successfully.  They also make sure we are in the water for the time that is comfortable to us, which keeping a strict tab on all safety measures."
Peaceful scenary,"If you want to have a peaceful holiday with scenic beauty, then this would be the right place. You could experience the view of different shades of sea. Best honeymoon spot as there will be independent resorts."
Got over my fears,"I had tried diving once before in my life and decided that it really wasn't my cup of sea. However, as a friend of mine decided to try diving in Havelock, I decided to give it a second try.Subhash from Andaman Bubbles proved out to be the most patient, but still a very determined instructor, and he got me under the surface despite the fears I had. After that it was just amazing. I felt comfortable and safe and really enjoyed the experience. I highly recommend!"
Wonderful Experience,Instructors were very friendly and the boat crew was good too. I would definitely suggest this place to other diving enthusiasts!
Bummer of an experience,"We had decided to do two days of diving, but it had been over 6 months since our last dive so they required that we do a refresher. We understood the reasoning, but the 3 hour refresher on the local reef that we drove to was considerably more expensive than a day of diving (1.5 hour boat ride each way, two dives, snacks and water). This just did not make sense, but in order to go diving we agreed. There was consistent miscommunication with our dive and we were charged an additional fee for a service we were not provided. All in all, not a good experience."
Everything Was very well,We had a very good experience with Andaman bubles... Only one Thing... When we arrived the Instructor dont stay hallo or anything.. Dont tell what happend now... But we Saw the other instructors do that... So it Was only our Instructor who wasn't so serviceminded.
Good experience,"Everything worked - good divemaster, nice boat crew. Fine boat and good food. I Can absolutely recommend this place for diving."
Fun Professional and Freindly,"We went to Havelock with the sole intent of getting a certification in Scuba diving and Andaman bubbles didn't disappoint us in the least. Our SSI Open water instructor Abhijeet deserves a special mention. He was calm, extremely patient, friendly, serious at times and fun to dive with.I would recommend them anytime to anyone - be it beginners with little to no swimming experience to pros who want to tune up their skills.Thank you Abhi! Thank you bubbles.Thanks for the free Tee."
"A nice experience, none less than a foreign tour to Europe or Australia","I had very nice experience. Worth enjoying with family. The historical monuments are very interesting, add to our knowledge. Beaches are very clean and enjoyable."
professional.  fun,"A lot of the resorts have their own diving groups but we went to Andaman Bubbles because they seemed to have the highest volume of divers.  They insisted on me doing a refresher, which while slightly annoying, spoke of their professionalism.  The staff were helpful, friendly and fun and I would go with them again.  Some of the mouthpieces on the second stages were a bit chewed up - so not all of their clients have been as comfortable as I was!They catered for a range of divers.  An excellent experience."
Experience of a Lifetime!,"Must say I have wanted to go diving for a long time and finally had the opportunity to experience it along with my daughter 11 and niece 16. I am so glad we chose Andaman Bubbles as their entire team, equipment and planning was fantastic and they made us feel super safe and secure! Despite hitting bad weather, their team did their best to make this a memorable experience for us and so it was!  Rizvan and his team are doing a wonderful job, please keep at it and wish you all the best."
Excellent Diving Company with friendly welcoming employees,"I came to havelock for five days and decided the dive for three of them. I got a great offer on a Refresher course with one additional dive the same day. Then I went for the Advanced Course. Unfortunately I got extremely seas sick on the boat to the dive site and could not complete any of my scheduled dives the first day of the course.Since I couldn't complete the course, I didn't have to pay anything and I am very grateful for that.Can highly recommend Andaman Bubbles, ask them to take you to Dixon, from what I have heard that dive is fantastic!"
"Professional, friendly and good fun","I dived with Andaman Bubbles a few weeks ago when I was on Havelock and had a great time.  There was a varied group on the boat including certified divers like myself, people doing an Open Water course and Advanced Open Water Course.  For certified divers there was one dive guide for every 2 divers and I felt very well looked after.  All the equipment is assembled for you and you're helped into and out of the water, I felt thoroughly spoilt!  Drinking water and snacks were provided and I loved the vegetable samosas!  The next time I visit Havelock I will dive with these guys again."
Extremely helpful and friendly,Myself and my girlfriend were unsure about going diving in the first place but when we spoke to Andaman Bubbles they were very helpful and patient with our questions.The diving instructors are very friendly and make you feel safe.
Professionals at their best..,"Its always been a pleasure diving @Andaman bubbles. Their greatest USP is the Quality of divers who show immense level of professionalism and builds confidence within visitors taking up the sport for the first time.Personally i have been diving with them for over 3 years and have successfully completed several  dives. Thank you Rizwan, Zhan, Subhash .. Its was a pleasure diving with you..Vishal Saigal"
Great experience with an extremely professional and caring team,"We went for I introductory dives for the family. Five of us dived. Two instructors and their team assisted us. Very professional and skilled team. All of us had a great time. They were very patient, took detailed lessons and checked everyone out very carefully ensuring a safe and thoroughly enjoyable experience"
Great Discovery Scuba Dive for Apprehensive Divers,"This was my second discovery scuba dive.  It was both better and worse for than the first for various reasons.THE GOOD:  You learn your skills in the cove rather than a pool so you're already learning your required scuba skills in the ocean.  After getting comfortable with breathing, retrieving and clearing the regulator, and clearing the mask you swim out about 50 meters to a shallow reef (approximately 10 meters) to start the dive.  The Instruction is one-on-one so you always have a dive instructor guiding you.  This makes it a very comfortable experience for those that are apprehensive about the diving experience (especially jumping off the boat).  Our instructor Zahn was amazing - as I'd been on a dive before, she stayed with my husband as a guide and just let me follow her.  My husband was pretty apprehensive and she made him feel very comfortable and capable.  They also take photos and video with a GoPro camera and prepare a CD for you - included with the fee for the dive!THE BAD:  Everyone dives here so there wasn't much to see.  I expected amazing Andaman corals and fish but the corals were bleached and we only saw clownfish and a couple of other small fish species.  By comparison, on my previous discover scuba dive in Key Largo, we got (2) 30 minute guided dives where I saw a variety of colorful corals, stingrays, parrot fish, a 5-foot long nurse shark, and numerous other fish.MY ADVICE:  Andaman has some AMAZING dive sites.  Don't waste your time doing the Fun Dive unless you are apprehensive.  Just take 2 days and get your certification - it's affordable and you'll visit far better dive sites."
Don't even think about any other dive school,Best. Experience. Ever.Great instructors. Great views. Great food. Great fun! For the amateurs and pros it is the best place to go. Plus the ever beautiful Andamans does the rest 😁
fantastic,"It was great experience of Scuba Diving with Andamans Bubbles. We did Scuba diving in the morning of 06/12/2014. We were given orientation on Scuba Diving and training before taking dive into the sea. The trainers are experienced, well trained and humble. We were group of 10 persons and 2 teams of 5 persons each were formed. Every person was accompanied by a trainer during the dive. We were taken on Nemo Reef in Havelock Island which has rich variety of natural coral formations. I have spectacles but they gave me powered mask to suit my eye power. Hence I faced little problem while Scuba Diving. Initially I was wondering how I could take such a heavy weight of equipment set and whether I can really do the Scuba diving. But you really do not feel any weight of the equipment set under the water and the trainers make you comfortable while under the sea by giving tips from time to time. I could enjoy entire time slot of 45 minutes of dive. I was taken 12 metres deep into sea. As you go deeper you feel pressure on your ears but it can be alleviated with certain techniques taught by the trainers. The view of the underwater marine life was simply awesome. I could see variety of corals and fishes. I even walked on sea bed with attached leg-fins for some time and it was quite amazing. They also undertake underwater photography and videoshooting. I was on honeymoon trip to Andamans and it was quite wonderful to click a photo with my wife under the water. It is a lifetime experience and the memories are everlasting. The rates offered by Andaman Bubbles are cheaper and the time period of Scuba Diving is longer compared with other Scuba Diving centres operating on Havelock Island and Port Blair. I really thank Andaman Bubbles team for this wonderful experience. I wish I would take another dive with Andaman Bubbles.Prasad Tilve, Mumbai"
Wondeful but a little overpriced,"we had a wonderful experience. The training was nice and the undewater experience was absolutely breathtaking.  However,  I feel andaman bubbles is a bit overpriced considering thatthe others also take you to the same diving site."
Amazing Lifetime Experience!!!,"It was my first under water experience so I cannot compare the services I got. But it was a lifetime experience, the instructor was very friendly and helped greatly to complete the scuba dive comfortably. Recommended for everyone."
The best team to dive with...,"Date of dive - December 2014Experience - SpectacularI HAD a phobia of going under water but thanks to Andaman Bubbles and a with lot of encouragement and guidance from their friendly & competent divers, I could win over my phobia and at the same time discover a new world underwater. Would definitely give 5 stars to Andaman Bubbles, Rizwan, Subhash, Abhijeet, Coco, Tappu and Akshay.Thanks to all of you for making this trip a memory to be cherished for a lifetime. Am coming back very soon for a second round."
Great Experience,"Scuba diving is a must @ Havelock and I'm happy that I chose Andaman Bubbles for my dive. Very warm & friendly crew. Got to see a host of corals and many exotic fishes, and not to mention the famous clown (Nemo) fish. Spend at least 30-35 minutes underwater."
Get on a plane and get there NOW!!,"Diving in the Andamans was a truly indescribable experience. The instructors are incredibly warm and friendly- they make you feel completely at ease, even at the bottom of the ocean. I can't wait to go back for more."
Great safe diving,"Very enjoyable friendly professional diving company. Great diving sights.  Sharks, manta rays, barracuda, dolphins, turtles and more!Great food at the centre as well."
Super dive school - i want to go back already!,had such a great time; the instructors were all super nice and ours was really good. we were taught everything clearly and never felt unsafe. went to some beautiful dive sights as well and saw some lovely reef life.
Awesome Experience,"These guys are fantastic. I had a great time with them at Johnny's Gorge (a fantastic dive site) and it was perfectly arranged. The staff was competitive, warm and friendly. Zaan, Abhi and Tapu, thank you so much. Highly recommended for sure."
Great diving center!!,"Havelock has quite a few diving centers and I am really glad I decided on going to Andaman Bubbles.Very friendly & professional staff. Me and my wife did the DSD which was a life changing experience so much so I went for a second dive the next day. Rizwan gave me an exceptional deal on the whole thing. He also clicked a lot of underwater still & motion pictures of us using a Go Pro, which adds to the trip's album. Thanks dude!Have to thank the instructors Abhijeet, Subhash, Malhar and Tapu. They are very patient and know exactly how to calm first time divers and deal with their panic attacks.The dive shop is located just before Wild Orchid and is hard to miss. They have a tie up with 2-3 resorts and offer great deals for resident guests. Overall everyone is very warm and chilled out.I would highly recommend Andaman Bubbles to everyone and will definitely visit again for my Open water Level 1 course."
Best decision ever!,"Professional and fun, the team at Andaman Bubbles does a splendid job. My travels underwater were amazing to say the least. I did my Open Water course and had a fantastic instructor (thanks Abhijeet) and a cool manager/instructor (Rizwan) who made sure we got to go to some great sites.If you're planning on doing a course, I'd suggest you call in advance so they can accommodate you better. The dives themselves are so exciting. If you're lucky you can spot a shark or a turtle (the group with me did). But there are plenty of other species to take your breath away (heh).The bottom line is: The minute you step off the ferry at Havelock, tell the auto/cab driver to take you to Andaman Bubbles and book a dive. You won't regret it."
Andaman bouble  made our  undersea fun double,It was a wonderful experience & Our instructers abhijeet and shubhas were very caring and understanding
Nice staff nothing to see though ,Both dive sites had coral bleaching and did not have much to see. Dive shop and staff are nice.  However when I went the dive master kept us so closely grouped together I kept hitting people behind me. So much so it effected me seeing things cause I was so focused on not hitting people with my fins.
Scooba dive,"I and my wife went to Havelock islands in October and it was an amazing experience. As we were already mesmorized by the beauty of this place, just within some time we got an idea to discover an option to scooba dive in the coral filled waters of Andaman. Soon we came across Andaman bubbles and the rest is history. Amazing experience to go underwater and see the wildlife that you can only see on discovery channel. Very experienced rivers are the instructors and the cherry on the cake is that they will click underwater photographs. All in all a must do for the bucket list of a person who is an adventure freak."
Fun expirience,"Take the private cruise to reach Havelock. Do not travel if the weather is cyclonic.Scuba diving is fun, but you can try Sea walking if you are not comfortable."
GREAT SCUBA DIVING EXPERIENCE IN HAVELOCK,It was a great experience going for scuba diving with the experienced and friendly divers of Andaman Bubbles. All must go through this amazing experience of scuba diving.
great experience!,This was my first scuba dive and it was a great experience! The dive instructors were very good and made sure that we learn all the basics before jumping in. The area coverage and time spent in water were as promised. I wanted to go for another dive and they were kind enough to accomodate the request on the spot. They were also cool with our parents travelling with us in their vehicle to the different venues. It was a nice gesture from them! One thing that could perhaps be improved is the waiting time and the time spent going back and forth the different venues. Highly recommended!
Amazing staff very professional.,I dived with Andaman bubbles on October2014. It was a great experience. The staff was amazing and very professional. My girlfriend did open water course with them and was very happhaps well. I recommend Andaman bbubbles to everyone who come to dive in havelock.
"fun place, friendly people","Had a good 'first dive' with Andaman bubbles. The place is very relaxed with a very friendly atmosphere. The instructors are fun, welcoming and at the same time very good with what they do. Subhash and Malhar are wonderful! looking forward to visiting again.."
Scuba Memories Linger,"We did two fun dives with the team and enjoyed it to the core.The underwater of Andamans is finest in the world.The instructors were a lot of fun.Abhijit,Abhimanyu,Malhar and Subhash make a great team.My husband tried underwater photography for the first time and we got some great shots.Cheers!!"
scuba magic!,"it was in our group's bucket list to visit andamans and also go scuba, both were met here :D , Subhash and team took care of usand gave memories of our diving experience.  i have to say i was pretty exicted and nervous at the same time. the team had pre dive training which took all my fears away,  the dive was amazing, it was like i was in a screen saver of fish :P through the dive they kept checking if we were ok , in all the excitement i kept forgetting to equalize.  the post dive experince just left us wanting for more, so we have decided to come back again, and added being a certified diver in our bucket lists in short you guys can dive with them if ypu want a once in a life experience, doesnt matter if you know how to swim, this is the place to be!"
Bubbles Bubbles Everywhere,"The inspiration behind Scuba diving came from a movie. But it was much better doing it yourself then watching it on screen. It was like a trip into a parallel universe, a different world. Thoroughly enjoyed this 40 minute joyride. And I would like to thank my coach and companion Subhash and team for this beautiful experience. They were very patient with me and my queries and tolerated me for the entire duration of the dive with a smile. Great work guys and thanks a lot. Keep up the good work. Highly recommended to all tourist. Hope to see you again"
A Truly Remarkable Experience !,"We opted for Andaman Bubbles since it was located near our Resort. We chose to go for double dips since they offered good rates on the second dip. The trainers are thorough professionals and conducted both the dips with complete security and comfort. After the initial apprehensions, they really eased us into the dives. We really enjoyed the couple of dips (of ~40 mins each) at the Nemo Reef in Beach no.2 and saw a lot of marine life. By the time we went for the second dip we were so relaxed that we forgot all our fears and enjoyed the view to the hilt. Scuba diving can be addictive especially if you have money to splurge. The only department they could do with a bit of improvement (more than a bit actually) was the photography. The photos were clicked without thought as to the background or composition and most of our snaps seldom captured us with the beautiful marine life in the same frame."
A wonderful diving experience,"Thank you Subhash and team for a wonderful first diving experience. It could not have been better.Being a non-swimmer I was a little apprehensive about whether I will be able to cope up being under water for a long time. Subhash however made me feel like a pro. When we started with the short training session, I was more or less sure that I will not be able to hold on under water for too long. However, from training to the actual dive was a very smooth transition. All of a sudden I realised that I was actually coping up pretty well under water and it was one long dive that I had. I was able to do the entire 12 meters without any problems whatsoever. Thanks to the wonderful set of people handling me. From the time I stepped into the Andaman bubbles office meeting Taapu to enquire about the diving till being dropped back after the dive, it was a truly wonderful experience. Great work guys!!! Good luck and hope to see you some time soon."
"Fantastic,professional people!!","Having almost drowned once, years back, I always wanted to get over my fear of water and I don't think anything and anywhere else would have been a better option than this.I had been in touch with these guys since couple of weeks before we actually landed there and the communication has been very very good from them. Be it over email, whatsapp or phone. Being a guest at The Wild Orchid resort, we were even given special rates!! Talk about icing on the cake!!The guys, Rizwan, Subhash,Taapu and all others, all of them know their job and responsibilities very well. Both of us, being non-swimmers, were taken to the Nemo's reef near the jetty as that was the only option for us. The training before the actual dive was short but to the point. Were clearly told about the Dos and Don'ts!!My dive instructor was very very responsible and assured me again and again that, he was right behind me and all I need to do is, just enjoy!! And he was true to his words.I was able to go upto 9mts. I would not say the water was spectacular but it was amazingly beautiful nonetheless!!Every 30 seconds or so, the diver who was with you would ask you if everything was ok and would always remind you to equalize your ears. That was very re-assuring.After this wonderful dive, me and my wife have decided to do it again, very soon. Keep going guys, you guys are doing great!!"
Great economical way to experience diving,"This PADI accredited dive centre set with fat martins restaurant is a great way to dive - whether beginner or experienced (my girlfriend had never dived before) we felt completely safe and safety was always of the highest priority. Great value for money, saw a good range of fish and other marine life - only drawback was I couldn't stay for longer!! Instructors were highly professional and all great people. Thankyou!!"
Great Dive Shop,"Great dive shop with a great, friendly, interesting crew! Very experienced dive masters. They give a personal touch to the instructions and they know the best dive spots. A+"
Awesome experience! Value for money.,"Scuba diving  was not on the remote plans of ours when we came across Andaman Bubbles for the activity.A bit nervous and new to this idea of scuba diving for a non swimmer we entered the office. We were greeted by Abhi and the form filling time that we spent with him made us relaxed and Gave the confidence of experiencing the whole new world with safety ensured. Our instructor Subhash and his team made the scuba diving a splendid, super, marvellous and lifetime experience for us. Thanks a lot to this superb team. Visit to their office and have a look at the walls, you will understand my feelings and of many such others (some in the language I never seen)"
Best Diving & Boating experience,"We were a group of 12 people with 8 people willing to dive (First time divers) with myself having done Discover Scuba Diving once earlier. There were skeptics in our group, but the diving Instructors (Shubash and Abhi) made everyone extremely comfortable.Two divers were 13 years old and folks took extremely good care of kids. For the rest, we had absolute fun diving and didn't realize when 30 minutes were up!"
Scuba diving with concern and safety,"We were a group of 7 (age 8 to age 42) and did the discover scuba package with Andaman bubbles. It was a very nice experience with very good qualified coaches accompanying us. Thanks Rizwan, Subhash, Abhi and Xavier. We enjoyed the dive with you guys. Our kids age 8 and 9 also dived and the instructors gave them the right care and support required. Would strongly recommend diving with Andaman bubbles and if I get a chance will surely come back again for the Open water course."
Probably the best Dive Shop in Havelock!,"We were a 12 member group that had gone for scuba diving with andaman bubbles. First off, the dive shop is probably one of the cutest ones iv seen by far with a small cozy low-seating cafe connected to it. The minute u enter, it gives u a very comfortable and inviting vibe! Coming to the dive crew, they are all AMAZING! Rizwan, Xavier, Subhash, Abhi and every single other instructor there are very helpful and super friendly! Even if we weren't diving, we could go over and hangout with them and be completely at ease. When diving, they were extremely professional, safety conscious and caring. The prices are very cost effective, infact Bubbles is one of the most cheapest places I have dived at.Overall, I had a great experience with Andaman Bubbles! Thanks to all the instructors for making our experience so much fun and most of all kudos to you'll for handling out group of 12! We know its not very easy :P"
Amazing and Very Much Concerned ..Love Love Love,"Scuba diving was the best gift I gifted to myself Lol...yeah and I was very happy that for very first time my son is going to understand Discover Scuba and part of marine world....Subhas senior Instructor made all fears to turn in fun...equally had gossips with Abhi...Rizwan and Xavier regarding underwater challenges and they made my suspicious over protective motherly heart to allow my son to dive....when mah son was going to dive with Subhash it was sheer satisfaction within We did Discover dives under their scuba program, and our introduction to the underwater world was awesome! The previous day we were shown a few study material  that gave us an introduction to scuba diving and the seriousness of it(though its not at all serious). Later, we were given a very brief and precise demonstration by Subhash on how to test and use the equipment, following which we did the same. We were taken to the Nemo reef/Bay View and our experience there was mind-blowing. Subhas, our dive instructor, was very informative, friendly but equally strict! :) During my dive time, at times when I got panicky and wanted to get back to the Up surface he taken me to up immediately and when I was asked I was not able to explain wht happen...later on I realised I fail to take breath ..Lol Lol..bUT THEN I HAD MY BEST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE under water journey was one of Awesome experience of life........hope these guy will read it and laugh ..:D ...but he calmed me down and made sure I was all fine.Nevertheless, we had a awesome experience and we are definitely going back here to dive with them again!Even their office space is also very happening place in evening....if you love to instruct with people and want to listen stories of sea and around chit chat with them....most important being Single woman traveller ..I can say its very respecting place....They have few good resorts ..eat outs....exotic traveller Kitchen....must enjoy all these....Don forget to Meet team...rocking boys...This place is all about some serious fun, and they are too good at it! In fact...Overall THEY ARE NOT MONEY MINDED..OUR SAFETY IS THEIR FIRST CONCERN....AND THEY ALWAYS TAKE THIS ON PRIORITY..NOT SLUGGISH BUSINESS HUNTER...ONLY TAKE MONEY ONCE ENSURED OF WEATHER ...HEALTH AND HIGH SPIRITS TO DIVE....Yeah!!!! Great Pics they give you free later on....and if you wan you can ask them more underwater life pics...they are more than happy to serve us..."
Experience of life time,"This was the first time I visited Andaman and this was the first time I did scuba diving and I am so glad that I choose Andaman bubbles for that. Me and my wife we just had a great time at Andaman bubbles. The Instructors Thiyagu, Subash, Abhi, Tappu they were so friendly awesome guys they were just made our trip so much better. Can't thank you enough guys for the amazing experience. These are the most friendly people you could ever come across. Thanks for they amazing scuba dive guys. Love you all a lot. Gowri Shanker Erode"
Cheap dive shop - great instructors,The dive shop does not have too much fancy equipment or boats.  But it has all the basics you need for a good and safe experience.  The instructors are all very good and highly qualified.
Good helpful staff,"I did my open water dive course with Andaman Bubbles, the experience right from the reservation through email till the end was really great. My instructors were helpful and did their bit to help whenever required. Made 6 dives at different locations. Overall a great experience and value or money."
Really good experience,"I was really scared when I went for Scuba. After standing in the water and taking some basic tips from our Diver I was so scared that I decided that I will go back and not do it. Our Diver Subhash took my friends for a dive and I still couldn't muster the courage to go. I had already paid the money and it is non-refundable So there was no incentive for these people to convince me to do that. but Subhash after his dive with my friends convinced me and took me alone for the dive. I still panicked inside the water and he was there to help me. The experience under water was superb and if not for that guy, I would have gone back and wasted my chance to have that amazing experience."
Good but fake advertising!,Good experience. Though when asked they told us that we would go no more the 9/12 m deep and in the end we were 4 (the most!) and maybe 30 minutes no more!
Not so great. Might be close to terrible or very poor.,"I visited the Andamans a couple of weeks ago and decided to dive with the Andaman bubbles (after reading many good reviews and checking their rates). Initial plan was to do a open water dive course but due to the lack of time and the fact that Andaman Bubbles was booked (and had no place for us) we decided to do 2 dives instead.I am a doctor cum backpacker and traveler, having lived and traveled across the world I have lived in B&B's, Hotels, hostels. I have been a part of hiking groups, skiing groups and traveled solo for most of my life, and in all these years I have never come across such unfriendly and unprofessional services for which I had to pay!- Being a first time diver, I wanted to get used to the idea of being underwater, the training lesson was quick and lasted for 7 minutes most of which was hard for me to understand because of my heavily Bengali accented dive instructor.- I wear glasses and am astigmatic, no information whatsoever was provided to me on how I will be able to see underwater, I had to consistently try to talk to the dive masters (who btw completely ignored us for the 1 week diving course students)- They were NEVER polite, they never smiled or wished or greeted each other. When you go for a first dive you want to be made comfortable. - My dive instructor could not understand my semi american accent most of the times and that made me very anxious. He tried Hindi but then his Hindi sucked more than mine.(During the training he tells me we are going to dive and try how you do underwater, I thought it was just a trial dive but then midway I realize that we aren't trying but are actually going diving underwater!)- The dive sites for a first time dive were close to the jetty the corals there were completely bleached and there is not much you could see at 10meters anyway! (they don't tell you that when they take u there)- They don't even tell you what fish and corals you are allowed to touch and which ones you can't (I got an allergic reaction on my hand for touching one of the corals!) Thankfully I am a doctor because on the sleepy island I don't think a doctor would be available to attend me. (Oh and they don't even tell you what you will expect to see underwater- Lastly, on the second dive when I did get used to diving they just take you to like one place that is 10 meters deep (yet again! who measures how deep it actually is, most people don't care I think and it definitely wasn't 12 meters) and bring you back up.I was just disappointed. I guess unless u pay a lot of money and do a course with them you shouldn't expect nice friendly people who want to make you feel comfortable.Cherry on the cake, was the fact that my dive instructor was a tobacco chewer I knew what he would put in his mouth for breathing next and I doubt they wash or sanitize that equipment plus when he was training me I saw all the tobacco stuck in his teeth come out in particles and dissolve in ocean water right next to me. I had no choice but to train in the water with and around him as it was too late to change instructors. Oh and I forget something important, while sitting alone in the cafe one of the dive instructors tried hitting on me. Good luck to whoever chooses this dive school or is a female traveling solo. I completely do not recommend it!!! SO SO UNPROFESSIONAL."
Excellent Dive Center for Beginners,Excellent scuba dive center. Very nice and friendly people. Really made us very comfortable and that was key to get the necessary confidence - especially with 2 young kids (10 years and 12 years). They looked very professional and adept. They are one of the three 5-star PADI rated dive centers in Havelock. I would highly recommend this place.
Truly Amazing,"We dived with Andaman Bubbles this week and they are simply amazing in their hospitality as well as their professionalism. Not only did they organise three dives a day with less than a days notice, they also managed to incorporate the sites we requested and that too after a late arrival on the first day. Xavier, Rizwan, Tyagi, Krishna, all made our time memorable. The equipment they had was also top class. On day one we dived off the wave dancer which is a speed demon, on the second day we took the SS Jet to Guddu's garden. While the ss jet lacks the speed of the wave dancer, it is perfect  for a big group to chill together. When we managed to push our departure to the next morning, they immediately got on the phone and organized for additional tanks to be brought over on the dungi so we could do another dive. They went out of their way to accommodate us  and for that im truly grateful. Cant wait to go diving with them again. Dived at johnnys, minerva, guddus garden, inket and the wall. All truly spectacular site's"
Bring out the bubbly!!,"Hats off to Andaman Bubbles....one of the best dive shops in all Andaman. I dived with them for a week and I have to say, they were absolutely amazing. Rizwan, Xavier, Zan, Thyagi, and the rest of the dive staff and dive masters were just amazing.They made my trip to the Andamans absolutely worthwhile. They have a couple of awesome boats to take you out diving. Be it the speed of the  Ive not met a dive shop yet where each of them went out of their way to make sure our every need was met. At a moments notice they arranged for 3 dives a day for a group of 9 people, which is no small task.Truly amazing knowledge of dive sites and their experience enhanced my entire dive experience.Look forward to going back at the first opportunity i get!"
Enjoying Scuba Diving,"It was a real great experience to scuba dive with Andaman Bubbles. Unfortunately, I was limited in time, therefore I chose just a morning course. After instruction of the diving and safety rules we dived to the reef with all it's colorful ""inhabitants"". Besides the instructors a photographier accompanied us. Instructors were very friendly and will skilled, the equipment was in very good condition (Made in USA). I can really recommend to go there !"
Best divers around,The divers are really friendly and makes you feel very comfortable before they take you inside for dive. They instruct in a very good manner and make the diver feel very confident. They are best in the business.
First experience of Scuba diving,"Me and my wife visited Havelock some time back in Feb and were living in Emerald Giecko , a great eco-resort to stay on the island. We wanted to do Scuba diving and were confused whom to trust as we had already heard about lot of people getting cheated in the name of scuba diving.I came across Andaman bubble while coming back from a leisure walk and talked to Rizwan in the shop and immediately made a decision to dive with the Andaman bubbles team. Some time later the team arrived at our resort and we were made to fill the medical forms that is needed to do Scuba diving. The team answered all our questions patiently and both me and my wife were pretty exited to get into the water.Were were taken to where they kept their Dive stuff and immediately changed into our scuba diving gear. We then went to the Kalapathar beach from where we would be taken into the sea as all private boats were siezed in Andaman due to a recent boat tragedy.We were given an initial training on what symbols to communicate underwater and how to breathe using the mask , what to do in case water goes in and other directions. After the training was done we were ready to go inside the water and see the magnificent marine life underwater. I was accompanied by Tyagu and he took good care of me during my dive.I did not face any issue in water and really had a great time seeing so many fishes.corals , sea plants and it felt like a different world altogether while i was down.  My wife did face some issues while diving but she was well taken care of by the instructor and she too enjoyed her dive a lot.We had a great experience with the team out there and would love to dive with them again."
we Celebrated Underwater,"Like normal Indians, I am also Scared of Deep waters in theOcean, to top it up it was my First Marriage anniversary. In the Beginning I was reluctant to do Scuba Diving, but then I thought of giving it a try. So then On the Day, I was very eager, although Nervous we got a Briefing from Subash, he tried to ease up the air which was filled with nervousness, he gave crystal clear Instructions and in the  end he Said ""  Your Safety is My Responsibility, all I want you to do is Breathe "" when you hear things like these plus when you think there is someone assigned specially to you underwater. I started getting more relaxed and couldn't wait any longer to get in. The Entire Crew Abhi, Tyagi, Hardik and the others (sorry i m bad in remembering names) were very chilled out, encouraging and Informative. they made this Event really Enjoyable and adventurous. Also the Staff at the office were very friendly. (Rizwan)To be Honest, I changed from being fearful to WANTING to do Scuba diving  again in the near future.Thank you Guys you made our day.And for the People who are scared of the Deep, This is the place to go to overcome your fear.These guys will make you comfortable and you will really enjoy seeing the wealth of the Sea."
A look into another world,"In January I went with a group to Havelock, Andaman Islands. Almost all of us did an open water dive certificate course, and we completed it with great pleasure. The people of Andaman Bubbles were really friendly, open, excellent trainers and their english was really good. The diving was an amazing experience, the moment you go underwater you enter a complete different world. The sounds, the view, the breathing, everything is different. But the instructors were so nice and so patient that even the people who found it scary at the beginning were completely relaxed on the last dive. It was an absolutely wonderful experience!"
Wonderful Experience!,I visited Havelock on 14th November 2013 with my friends. I am a non swimmer and was afraid at first to go for scuba diving. But the team of Andaman Bubbles and especially Subhash made us so comfortable and made the task look so easy that our after initial hiccups we enjoyed the experience which cannot be described in words. Simply loved the dive as well as friendly team there. Will strongly recommend to other travelers to go for dive only with Andaman Bubbles :)Great work guys!
Diving & Hospitality 6 /5,"My first Scuba experience went killer!!Thanks to the Bubbles team (Rizwan ,Subash & Tapu),though nervous in the beginning the way made us laugh i forgot things and jumped.Bubbles team made us really important unlike other dive companies who didn't even bother crack a joke .Will be coming back for more dives @ Andaman Bubbles. I must say their hospitality is the best in Havelock Island."
Dive with them!,"Knowledgeable staff - did my first discover scuba dive with them and it went perfect! Heard great feedback from fellow travelers who took their certified courses as well. Recommend spending quality time at their cafe and having long chats with the staff about their diving expeditions, adventures and life's experiences - pretty much everyone we met had unique stories to tell."
Scuba dive at Havelock,We just loved the waters of Havelock and my family enjoyed scuba dive under water.  Out of the world experience as this was the first time we did scuba dive.
SSi OW @ Andaman Bubbles,"We got our SSI OW cert at Andaman Bubbles and are just so pleased. The three of us had chosen the SSI instead of PADI cert, which meant that we'd done all the studying at home and could go straight to the business of getting in the water. Our instructor was Yannis Zouridis, who also runs a diving centre in Greece. We have nothing but praise to Yannis. Big on safety, very calm and good at giving instructions. Assisting divers Subhash and Abhi were like hovering guardian angels in the water. Both my sister and I have a fear of deep water but with these guys that wasn't an issue. Had it not been for RockaRolla - a poor excuse for a boat - I'd give them 10 stars out of five possible. The trip back takes at least 30 min in boat, choppy waters, spray and wind, she offers no shelter and I was floored for the evening upon return on the second day.  Luckily Yannis pushed for us to get a slightly better boat the remaining two days. The white sporty boat you see as their profile picture? Maybe they borrowed it for a photo-shoot..."
Must Watch....!!!!!,"This is the most beautiful beach that India has.... The sea water is so clean.... the beach has also been kept in a very good condition by the locals and authorities.... Its a must watch and i bet that you will truly enjoy it.... its a beach for all...family, children, friends and of course for couples/.... ;)"
Awesome Experience..,It was a wonderful experience.. we started in the morning to their office and they took us to bay view and there we practiced for 40 mins and the actual scuba started ... And we have no idea how long it is for.. Great Experience... Abhi & team were helpful in guiding us first-timers. Looking forward to my next scubadive with Andaman Bubbles !!!
Andaman  havelock and Neil island Full Moon,Water  crystal clear.Fullmoon night  amajing experienceon sea side.  Sands are white.Worth spending time.Scubadiving and snorkeling main attraction..
Incredible Experience.,"This was the first time i was trying out a dive. The staff at Andaman Bubbles were incredible, helpful, highly skilled and very well trained. They gave me the basics i needed to function underwater. After which i was taken under by one of the shops dive masters. The dive sites were amazing and i had the fortune of spotting a lot of marine life. Very exciting stuff. I can comfortably say that i will be returning very very soon to do my open water course and would not even consider another dive shop. I would strongly reccomend that anyone planning on visiting the andamans goes for atleast one dive with andaman bubbles. Look forward to seeing u guys real soon. Special shout out to Zan, Tyagi and Hardik (all divers with andaman bubbles). Cheers."
Its new world down the underwater,Bubbles were good and the only diving center offered us discount on our dive. we found no hiccups whatsoever in finishing our docs & learning basic Technics about diving. Mr.Das & Tyagu helped us every moment and train us quickly (  staff are friendly and good ). it was pleasure diving with them. it was extremely different world down the underwater. but the drawback is. there is no more underwater creatures or animals to see where bubbles have had marked area for beginners and no camera was not working ( later it was repaired and took us down for snaps ). Overall it was pleasure to dive as guys in Bubbles made our dive enjoyable.  .
Andaman,"On arrival at Port Blair, I found the agency very well managed and disciplines. It was meticulous in planning all my tour needs extremely well. Accommodations and vehicle for movement were very good. Persons deputed as driver/guide were extremely courteous and helpful. During my entire tour a very personal and family-live atmosphere prevailed which made it extremely congenial & enjoyable.Dr. S. A. AsgharNew Delhi"
"Wonderful experience, showed me a new world!!","Part of the Wild Orchid resort this dive resort is very warm and friendly. It is cheaper than its competitors Barefoot Scuba and in our experience the staff much more helpful and no arrogance unlike those we spoke with on the desk at Barefoot Scuba. This was my partners first time diving, and he done a 4 days Open Water Padi course for approx £220. His instructor Ahmed (from the Maldives) was a wonderful instructor who filled both my partner and his dive buddy (Dave- who owns an Internet Cafe and a snorkel booking centre near Village - Called Seahawks) with confidence and reassured them every step of the way. They had a wonderful time, and saw sting ray, and lobsters all at the same time as learning to dive. Ahmed was a fantastic instructor and a credit to The Andaman Bubbles dive centre. Oh and rumours have it crocs lurk under the boats of Barefoot Scuba!! :O Dive Andaman Bubbles!!!"
"U don't vsit Andamans oftn or Dive reglarly..thrfore it's ur right 2 hve thngs gud(if nt best),at least da pricey ones..","We were a group of 8 and had our trip planned by Padmini Travels. Before I review Andaman Bubbles I would like to say a few words about Padmin Travels, as I am unable to find any page to express my views about it.Mr. Chellian, the owner of Padmini travels who is extremely courteous, manages entire trip. The way he managed our trip made the experience, the best we (saying on behalf of my group) have ever had. Why I am giving so much credit to Mr.Chellian?In a trip if you aren't behaved properly most likely your mood’s gonna get spoiled. Then what so ever you see what so ever you experience, everything feels bitter. In short that particular day of your vacation is ruined. Therefore, I have always valued service more than anything. Now it's a general assumption that service is always expensive. If you are one of those who share the same view meet Mr. Chellian. I guarantee you can't get a lesser quote than Padmini Travels by any means over internet. The Package (Budget) we took was for 6 days and 5 nights @ Rs.10500/- per person which included Scuba and Sea Walk. The best quote we got other than Mr.Chellian's was for Rs 9500/- per person WITHOUT Scuba and Sea Walk. Why I say Mr. Chellian's service was great? Service is not to be in a 5 star hotel with no idea of what the hell is going on, or say nobody will be to respond your queries, or say your driver is indifferent about your convenience, etc.Service is valuing customer, which Mr. Chellian did very nicely. Not only Mr. Chellian but the hotel (a budget AC Hotel) where he put us in, the driver who took us to places, the agents in other islands, each and everyone manifested what unmatchable GOOD SERVICE. Along with this the impeccable beauty of Andamans made our trip LITERALLY UNFORGETTABLE. NOW ABOUT ANDAMAN BUBBLESThis was the only DISAPPOINTING part of our entire trip. When asked for feedback by Mr.Chellian, we communicated our views to him. Hope that has reached these guys.Now the Issues:There were many trainers/divers who were supposed to take us diving one by one. Among them one, whose name I don't remember but remember that he is from Nagpur, was very rude, very indifferent about visitors. To him, first goes on of my friends to dive. Prior to diving they train you for half an hour or so. After sometimes my friend returns and says ""The trainer said I can't dive because I am not able to grasp the training well. He says I can't breathe well"". Next goes another and he also comes back for the same reason. Next I went to him. He started training me and each line came out of his mouth was rudely told. I remember, at a point, he told current is high I can't take you deep. I asked softly ""Current!”. He says you are an (this) and you don't know what current is. I said nothing to that.May be my English is poor, may be that trainer was a genius. But that is the least a customer is bothered about. A trainer has to do his job and that too courteously, which was in fact in this case poorly done.If that particular trainer is reading this review..  ""Get your understanding clear about tides, waves, and ocean current. You are a diver. At the very least it is expected of you to know what the hell ocean current is"".   Coming back to the diving part, I grasped things quickly and within 5-10 minutes was ready to dive. But the worst part was he made me dive say max for 10 mins that too hardly at 4 meters deep, whereas the claim was made to take us 10-12 meters deep and make us dive for 30-40 mins. When I came out, I asked one of my friends ""How deep did you go"". To that the ungracious trainer jumps in and replies rudely ""It's not how deep you go, it's about what you see"". Frankly, I saw nothing except a couple of fishes, at least much much much less than what I  saw during snorkelling at Jolly Boy, which is a must visit place, and even lesser than during Sea Walk, a must do activity, at North Bay Island. In the meanwhile, first friend of mine who was denied diving went to another trainer, a well behaved lady. She trained my friend, the same person whom the other rude trainer refused to take for diving, very well, and took him for diving say for more than 30 minutes and to considerable deep portions. This was all done after my diving was finished i.e. when, in the rude dim-witted's words, the ""CURRENT"" was high. Out of 8 only 2 were extremely happy with the diving. These are the 2 who went diving with the lady. 3 were like OK and 3 including me were very dissatisfied. So my point is nothing is perfect and ever’ll be perfect. But we need to see the probability of getting a great experience, which in Andaman Bubble's case is very low given the type of trainers it has. As most of the trippers would be diving very less, it is advised to go to diving centres where chances of having a great experience are high. Because it is your right to have good time when you spend so much, take time out of your busy schedule and come down to such places. I know of my friend who went diving with some other diving centre where the accompanying diver made them swim through the corals with all safety.No wonder Andaman Bubbles is the lowest rated diving centre in Trip Advisor."
Scuba dive with Andaman bubbles,We had our stay in Symphony palms in Havelock island.Wanted to do a scuba dive hence thought of doing it through some professional group like Dive andaman..but since we had done advance booking with them it got full...hence we booked our scuba dive with Andaman bubbles which was recommended by Dive andaman..it was a gr8 experience with ABubbles..since it was our first time dive ..we were trained properly ..no snacks given on boat..actually u need to consume lot of water..they charged us 4000 for dive+ photos(which are decent enough)..dont bother about the time u will be underwater..since it is upto a person how much he can manage & sustain the ear pressure..overall it was a gr8 experience..wud like to do it again since now we have learned the technique..
"Take the plunge, see the world in the waters","We had an awesome diving experience at Andaman Bubbles. Nikhil with all diving instructors, Xavier, Rizwan and others were really friendly. We were given good guidance regarding the choice of courses for beginners. The diving equipment was well maintained and upto the mark and our instructor Xavier was strict as hell in our training in shallow waters for the first 2 days. When he took us for our first 12 meter dive we realized all that training was worth it. We had all our fear for diving in deep waters taken care of and had fun exploring the rich ocean life. Cannot wait to go back for more dives...hope it happens soon and our choice again will be Andaman Bubbles."
scuba diving is mind blowing,Its the best and beautiful experience I ever had... the life and colors u find under water are simply awesome...I did SSI open water diving course with andaman bubbles in feb 2013... I owe you guys (andaman  bubbles crew) for this experience...andaman bubbles is fully equipped with all kinds of apparatus  needed for diving.is safe to dive with bcoz they will let you enter water only if you and instructor are confident about how comfortable you are under water and instructor keeps track of every student underwaterinstructors here are very skilled and they will give you reason behind every aspect of change in your body while diving and teaches you remedial action to balance the change are trustworthy with your valuables bcoz i misplaced my wallet b4 diving  at the equipment storage site and the boys found it and returned it.boat boys are helpful in wearing and removing your diving gear ...what else anybody needs to have for this beautiful experience?if you visit andamans   u make sure u visit havelock .. beautiful beaches and great diving sites there
Fantastic trip to the Andamans,"Thank you India,  thank you gets holidays.  Just came back from Andamans and must say it is one of the most beautiful places on earth.  The beaches are completely unspoilt and the diving is superb.  To add to that the hotels selected were just perfect and good value for money.  Our driver Rakesh was very courteous and made sure we made the most of our trip.  One piece of advice do not hurry up Andamans like we did,  it needs at least a week if not more. Do not miss out on Havelock island at any cost its the most amazing place I have ever been too."
Great choice for diving,"We were a group of 4 girls visiting Andamans and were keen on diving after reading all the reviews. As we were all amateurs, we were quite skeptical about it. After a lot of deliberation, we chose to dive with Andaman Bubbles. The bookings were done by our agent GoAndamanHolidays. All the formalities like signing some documents, getting proper size for the equipments and suits were done the prior evening at the dive shop(next to Wild Orchid). Andaman Bubbles has its dive centre on beach no3 where we were given a theoretical session on the signs and equipments. Then we proceeded to the beach for scuba skills practice. After a 15min ride on the boat, we reached the dive site. Claudia and Venissa (other instructors) set out with 4 guys who were along with us. Rizwaan decided to take 2 of us in one go along with another local fellow who he claimed was certified too. We put on all our gadgets/equipments and set out for a lifetime experience.  The instructors reminded us to equalize regularly so that we were not uncomfortable. As we went down, we could feel the pressure but equalizing helped us. I must say, it is altogether a different world inside the sea. We saw lots of beautiful coloured fishes, corals, sea cucumbers etc.The instructors were with us all the while and after some time we were pretty comfortable. The entire journey lasted for about 30mins and we went down till 5meters.We found Andaman Bubbles to be quite professional, just that you have to be with the right instructor. The local guy seemed to be very confused and we could not follow his instructions, where as Rizwaan was just amazing. Also, they take good care of the suits and equipment. After the dive, all suits and gears were disinfected in dettol water. Our only concern was regarding the pics that were taken underwater, they did not come out that well. The fishes were not visible at all. I am not sure if there was a problem with the camera or it is always like that. We paid Rs.3500 per person for scuba (3000+500 for pics)Tips : Eat light and wear your swim suit within so that you can wear the scuba suit on top of it."
thank you bubbles,"great diving club- professional, safe and very nice and welcoming staff.  my husband is now seriously considering doing his dive master there... we loved it!"
Andaman Bubbles Is The Best !,"As part of our group excursion we were set to visit the Andamans. As this was a adventure expedition we decided To vist havelock , Keeping in mind the beautiful Dive sites Present there,We were in contact with Barefoot Initially but later choose Andaman Bubbles , There Website And As well as Our primary interactions were so positive that We trusted on andaman bubbles to handel a Group of 40 kids. Right from the discove scuba dives to The open water course. On behalf Of our entire group we would Like to thank the entire crew for such a memorable trip. Small Tip : When travelling to the Ship Wreck : MV Mars We Used the Smaller boat ehich kind of gets irritating after sometime due to the engine sound. Againg choose none Other Than Andaman Bubbles !"
Awesomeness!!!!,"After mustering enough courage to hit the cold waters of Scotland and wanting to recover from drysuit diving in August last year, I booked a week of diving with Andaman Bubbles.  Early on in the year I had emailed all the dive schools in Havelock and decided to go with Andaman Bubbles. Not only was my initial enquiry replied to very promptly but it was very friendly and Nikhil answered all my (three million) questions very patiently.Once I got to Havelock everything was like clockwork – from the pickup, accommodation (I stayed at Emerald Gecko), nitrox course and the diving itself.  As I was in Havelock at the start of the season, I had to privilege of diving exclusively with a different instructor each day. Things got a little crowded though on the last two day days of my holiday when we had another customer join us! :)  All the instructors/divemasters and boat staff were very friendly which made the whole experience even more enjoyable.  It was really nice having spent a week with the Bubbles team and I hope it won’t be too long before my next trip to the island.  I would highly recommend Andaman Bubbles if you want to continue your dive education and definitely if you want to have some fun diving!"
Experience of a life time :),"Andaman Bubbles rock! I have done my open water crtification with them this year in February '12 - the team hear is absolutely praise worthy. Their professional yet warm and friendly approach to guest will make u feel comfortable on the island. As a first time diver I had a lot of queries & presumptions before I could take on to diving..n Nikhil himself as well as the instructors and the dive masters were patient & happy enough to entertain me n answer all my queries right from day 1. AB is very transparent about their processes & rules. They are well equipped & sufficiently stuffed with d latest of diving equipments. Safety & comfort of guests is priority at AB and at the same time they are flexible enough to accomodate your wishes too -  Which eventually makes the dives absolute fun! N to support the entire show, AB has got a lovely set of Instructors, Dive Masters & Staffs :)) Very friendly and ready to help at any given point in time :) I loved my frst dive vacation! Thanx to team AB! Cheerios!!P.S: One thing what I personally feel, that makes the instructors, dive masters n ofcourse Nikhil stand out from the rest of the Dive Centers on the island  - is their love for diving and love for the island. Running a 5 Star Dive Center so successfully is one side of the story but the way these guys strive to maintain this island is really commendable :) Wish u all d success guys!!"
"Poor Diving, Terrible, terrible Staff","Here's the headline: don't dive with these guys - if you are looking for a good dive shop on Havelock, go with Dive India or Barefoot Scuba.Here's the longer version:In general, we found the staff to be completely unhelpful, extremely self-absorbed and just overall terrible. We were a group of five divers (plus other friends), all of whom have dived several times before and so can say this with experience. The only time the staff was actually nice to us was when they *crashed* our party at the beach at night (yes, they overheard us talking about it on the boat and just walked right in). I believe the owner's son is a divemaster at the shop, which may explain the weird dynamic at play - they really don't seem to give a damn about you as a customer. For example: being five divers who did multiple days of diving and four others who did a Discover Scuba we gave them *plenty* of business. On one particular day two of the divers decided against doing a second dive - instead of refunding all (or at least some!) of the money, they refused to do so. Another example: We had had terrible weather while there so the diving in general sucked. On a particularly choppy day, a couple of the divers were feeling pretty seasick, so we requested them to drop us off at the main jetty which was literally on our way back to the north jetty that they use. Our friends told them they would take rickshaws to the north jetty and meet them there. They refused! So my friends sat there, feeling sick as we literally skirted around the jetty. Another example: on the first day, when we arrived, they insisted that I do a dive to gauge my skills - despite my telling them that I hadn't slept the night before and didn't think it was a good idea. Eventually I refused, slept, and when I went back in the evening I talked to the manager, requesting him to allow me to dive with my friends and walking him through my dive experience (I had forgotten my logbook which was the issue). He acquiesced, but then at 10:30 pm that night he came to our hotel and told me that his dive masters refused to dive with me because I had refused to come dive in the afternoon! As a result, I couldn't dive with my friends.Never again."
Extremely unprofessional staff,"Extremely unprofessional staff!!! Would not recommend to anyone!I was diving with my husband with the Andaman Bubbles in April 2010. We had reserved 8 dives to each and payed in advance half of the sum.By the second diving day I had developed a flu, and thought that I would not be diving during that day, but ""dive instructor""  offered me some medicine (Sinex Plus) so that I could dive. I dived twice during that day with the help of the medicine.After those dives I developed a very strong pain in the ear and most of mydiving  vacation ( 8 days) was ruined - no diving, just purchasing variouspain killers from the pharmacy, queing every day for the doctor who couldnot help in any way. Neither did I receive any help or advice from the Andmana Bubbles. One Indian man was studying there at that time for becoming a dive master, and he told me that it had been unprofessional to offer me the medicine for diving. He speculated that I had developed a barotrauma because of the medicine.I consulted 7 times a doctor, and none of them had the ear lamp for lookingin my ear. Only back in Delhi I found an ear specialist and he made thediagnosis of ruptured eardrum. It took few months to recover, and the scarremains.After contacting  Andaman Bubbles for making a complaint about this (only after one year, but I wanted some kind of apology, and also ensure that the person would not do such thing for anybody else, this was done by the recommendation of another PADI dive instructor) . In the email the staff told me that they do not remember this incident. I wanted to ensure that the Bubbles ""dive masters"" will never again do anything as unprofessional as offering flu medicine containing pain killers for divers. Also apologies would have been expected."
Unspoiled Diving,"Anyone that has traveled in India knows that it is hectic and draining. We had planned our trip to India and didn't want to return home more tired than when left so we headed to the Andaman Islands for a few days of diving and R & R. We had contacted Andaman Bubbles in advance and liked the communications we had. The day we arrived on the island we headed straight to the dive shop to set up diving for the next day. We met with Jonathon. He was a happy, enthusistic guy and without any hesitation we booked 5 days of diving over the next week. There was an Australian couple that were booked to dive the same days we were and since Andaman Bubbles keeps their groups small and assigns only 4 divers per dive master, the 4 of us were designated as a group. The overall experience was very good, but there was a couple of things that could use some improvement. First is more an Havelock Island dive industry deficiency rather than an Andaman Bubbles deficiency. The boats that are used to access the dive sites are traditional local boats called 'dunghis'. I did not see all of the boats from all of the dive shops but the 1/2 dozen I did see were all in need of repair. The 'Rock n Rolla', our boat for 5 days was no different. There were several floor boards that were not secure and part of the gunnel that we rolled into the water from was non existent. The boat need a general overhaul, but it did get us out to the dive sites and back 5 days. The other thing about those boats that needs to be considered is the motor. They are outfitted with ancient diesel tractor motors that do not have a muffler system. These are extremely noisy and smelly. I'm quite sure a better solution could be had. The other thing that was not proper customer service was; one of the days we headed out in our dunghis for a days diving, one of the Andaman Bubbles owners left in the fancy speed boat for a day long joyride. From my perspective customer service dictates that the customer should benifit from the best the company has to offer and the worker, and especially the owner should make do with what is remaining. If the speed boat was going out that day the customer should have been on it, not the owner. (The reason I know it was a joyride is because I was chatting with the young lady that he was taking out to see the sites and she said the ride had no special purpose)With those two items out of the way. The rest of our diving experience was great. The dives sites chosen were very good and we enjoyed every dive. The diving in the Andaman's is not for the faint of heart. From my view it was quite difficult and technical. After our first dive the dive master felt that the four of us were capable of tackling the more advanced dive sites and he did say that less experience divers can be accomodated in differant areas but the places we went we contented with 1 1/2 meter swells and very strong currents. The terrain and fish were worth every second of the difficulties. The staff at the dive shop was excellent. Right from the day we contacted them by email until the last day when we settled up the bill. The office staff was always helpful and they made themselves available early in the morning till late evening. Each day unravelled as they had outlined and the adgenda was easy to follow. Each day when we arrived at the dive shop on the beach the gear we rented was at the staging area ready to be checked and loaded on the boat. All of the days tanks were rigged with the regs. and BCDs and on the boat. The dive master was ready to go and all we had to do was climb in and we were off. The dive master was quite good and kept us on a long leash, letting us do our own diving while making sure none of us disappeared. He and the two fellows on the boat were also a great help with equipment when it came time to exit the water in challanging conditions. As this was not a dive specific trip we took a minimal amount of dive gear with us, computers and a prescription mask. We had to rent all of the other gear. The gear at Andaman Bubbles is good gear and is in good shape. It all functioned quite well during our whole trip. They have safety sausages and whistles in every BCD, I think a wise addition considering the currents we experienced. I think that Andaman Bubbles is one very short step away from being a world class operation and that would be the boats, but don't let the dunghis stop you from booking your trip to the Andamans or from booking with Andaman Bubbles. We had a great time and I'm quite sure the folks there treated us no differant than any of their other customers. You will have a spectacular time diving with them."
