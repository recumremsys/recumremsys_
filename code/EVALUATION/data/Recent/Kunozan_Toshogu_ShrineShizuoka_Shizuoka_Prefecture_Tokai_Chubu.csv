Nice shrine & great climb to tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu,Climb uneven stone steps to the coloured shrine. Then keep climbing up up up to the tomb at the very top. A peaceful resting place and worth over 200 big steps. Nice bronze & stone lanterns & pillars along the way.
"Not for the grandeur, but for the history","Not the most impressive Shrine in Japan, but certainly it has the prominence. Layed out in a series of levels, irregular stone steps - makes visiting for some a bit difficult. Crowded at the site and especially in the ropeway leading down to the Shrine itself - I personally think they jam too many into the tram. Worth a visit, but not on the top bucket list."
Breathtaking beautiful,"Kunozan Toshogu Shrine is dedicated to Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu the famous leader who united present Japan and who lived after his retirement in nearby Shizuoka. His present can be found everywhere in the area so also at this shrine.The shrine itself is unbelievably beautiful and above all very colourful. You will see a lot of very nice pieces of painted carvings as well as golden elements along the roofs and pillars. I was very much impresses by the cheer beauty of it all.Visiting this complex is also a climbing experience since it is a more or less constant climb to the main shrine. For those who need it, walking sticks to assist your climb are available at the entrance area of the shrine. Very thoughtful.On the very top of the complex you will find the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu a very serene location.All in all, for me, Kunozan Toshogu Shrine was a very exceptional experience."
Distinctive Place of Honor,"We took ropeway car to very impressive temple and burial place.  Definite must if this a cruise ship stop.  We were able to see Fuji, so really special day.  Interesting topography in the coastline outcropping, so Shogun picked a great place.  Densely forested."
National treasure,"Toshogu shrine is thought to be in Nikko, but this is the 1st Toshogu, where the 1st Shogun is buried. This shrine holds annual commemorative ceremony for him on April 7. So, this is the one for rituals for him while Nikko has more gorgeous festivals."
Powerful Spiritual Experience,"The Kunozan Toshogu Shrine is definitely a must see along with Nihon Daira view.  The Shrine itself is beautifully designed with many colors.  There are lots of steps, so please do bring comfortable hiking/walking shoes and water."
Beautiful shrine,Way to many steps for me but my travel companions made it to the top.  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes.
Good Example of Shinto Shrine,"Built in 1617, the main shrine showcases lacquers and gold foils.  Similarly the other buildings are likewise painted every 50 years to preserve them.  Many steps take you past about 13 buildings in all and the final set leads to the grave of Ieyasu Tokugawa.  Fabulous vistas of SUruga Bay can be scene from this location"
National Treasure enshrined SHOGUN IEYASU,"This is the most famous shrine in Shizuoka which attracts many visitors not only from Japan but from all over the world.    Unlike Toshogu in NIKKO, this one has calm and tranquilized atmosphere. Established in 1613, just two years after the first Shogun IEYASU passed away, the buildings were very strong and in elegant mood.  On April 17, which is the day when he died, all the TOKUGAWA families get together from all over Japan and have an annual ceremony in honor of him.      On top of KUNO mountain, his mausoleum stands solemnly viewing west, just like looking at his birth place (OKAZAKI).     There is a museum in front of the entrance of the shrine, where swords or armors he actually used and a golden clock presented by the Spanish King are exhibited. For those who are interested in Japanese history, it is the best place!"
Very nice shrine,"Many, many steps to climb but really worthwhile to see. Very nice architecture. Use the wood and bamboo walking sticks found near the ticket booth. Go early to avoid the crowd"
Interesting shrine to visit in Sh,"Visited the Shinto shrine with a tour group. It is the burial place of the first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu and features many beautiful structures and art. The buildings are colorful and have elaborate wood carvings. They are protected as important cultural properties. The downside is that the place may not be so elderly friendly as there are many stone steps (200+ steps) leading to the buildings. Otherwise, it’s worth the visit!"
Small shrine on a small mountain,There is some walking involved and It is an easy climb up stone steps. There is detail in Japanese. Good idea to have a guide. There are great views of the coastline.
National Cultural Treasure,"Nestled in a rather remote peaceful hillside location there is no road access to Kunozan Toshogu Shrine. There are two ways to reach the shrine ascending 1159 stone steps from the bottom of the Kunozan Mt, or by descending on the  Nihondaira ropeway.  This is one of Japan's 100 most scenic spots where on a clear day you will have glorious views  of  Mt.Fuji, and the Suruga Bay below.  Over 400 years old it is a fine examples of ornate Shinto architecture and brilliant colours shrines temples that we saw in Japan.  The detailed decorations, rooflines,  bronze and stone lantern posts, and pillars are all impressive.  It was designated as a National Cultural Treasure in 2010. There are uneven, steep stone steps, often wet, in order to reach the Shrine complex."
Another temple (very expenssive one),"the original burial place of the first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate, and is thus the oldest of the Tōshō-gū shrines in the country. The main festival of the shrine is held annually on April 17Since up there at the cable cart station is hard to find taxi back to the port,  I hired a taxi for 3 hours and was enough drove us from and back to port. The shrine is nice,  though many steps to be climbed. Go early to avoid queue. Must be very clear day to see mountain Fuji. C U Around"
NOT an Easy Climb.,"I disagree, the climb is NOT an easy one.  The stone steps are uneven, steep and can be as high as 10 inches in certain sections.  The area was wet due to overnight rain.  We noticed many people who simply stopped after the first series because it was quite strenuous for someone who is not in top physical condition or may have some mobility limitations. The wood and bamboo walking sticks are situated near the ticket booth but are reserved for the elderly or those with trouble walking.We took a taxi to the ropeway and arrived shortly before the cruise ship buses. This shrine was one of the prettiest and colorful that we have seen in Japan.  There are a few structures in the small complex - none of which are open to visitors.  You simply look inside.  We reached the top of the hill.  Entrance fee is only 500 yen."
Easy climb,We went with a tour group and utilized the ropeway down the mountain to the shrine area. The shrine is an easy climb up stone steps and quite detailed and Japanese. There are great views of the coastline from the ticketing area.
Small shrine for the burial site of Tokugawa shogunate.,"It's only accessible with a cable car (5-minute one way ride costing about $5, running every 15 minutes), unless you are ready to walk up and down 1910 steps from the bottom of the mountain. It's admission fee I believe is about $7.  Small shrine on a small mountain called ""Kuno-zan""  The first Tokugawa Shogunate, TOKUGAWA, Ieyasu wanted to be buried there and his wish was realized.  Nikko Toshogu, which is more famous and grand, was built 19 years after this one."
Nestled in the nature.,"We had a tour which included a bus from main station in Shizuoka, from the top of the hills we got a 5 minutes trip with a cable car, and then we briefly climb to the temple to descend to the sea side from there we got two buses to go back to the station, was an interesting day, off of usual crowdy routes. All info are available at the Shizuoka Station information centre."
History ,It's a good climb up many steps to the top however the climb is worth it. The museum has artefacts dating back to the first shogun. The temple is extremely well maintained and there is a brochure in English available. A shop at the top if you need coffee and a seat.
An Amazing Experience,"Well, I had so much fun in this place and I will return soon.This shrine is so beautiful and all the vibrant colors shine in the sunlight. At the beginning of the shrine there are some shops that are very cute and smell like strawberries (thats what they're known for in that region in May I guess) you climb 1000 steps but its very beautiful and the view is amazing. And then the shrine is even better seriously don't miss out and visit!!!!"
Amazing Historic Shrine,This shrine is incredibly remote and high up in the mountains.  The best way to get here is via the Nihondaira Ropeway. The site is over 400 years old and has been restored to its former beauty.
Nice shrine in nice site ,"This shrine is nice, but not the nicest in Japan. People telling it's peaceful were obviously not visiting when crowded. I was there when a lot of Japanese were there, and it was definitely not peaceful! It's a place of historic importance though..."
Peaceful and beautiful!,Well worth the trip! Amazing scenery and photo ops. Highly recommend taking the Nihondaria Ropeway route. Number 41 bus took us straight there from Shizuoka Station!
Shrine,"Very similar to other shrines we have seen  in Japan.  This is a very peaceful place.  Great for taking pictures, fantastic details."
Stunning historical monument,"This shrine is hard to get to but well worth it.  We took the gondola from the plateau.  There are several gates and you must walk up many steps with tall risers, so take advantage of the free bamboo walking sticks by the first gate.  The sticks made a big difference as we climbed higher and higher to the top.  The views from the top to the bay would be spectacular on a clear day, but we arrived in the middle of a rain storm.  Still the place has a grandeur and mystery that is haunting.  We took many photographs of the structures including the roofs and intricate detailing.  Several beautiful cherry trees in bloom on the site in early April.  See this site for a peaceful break from modern Japan."
"Exceptionally beautiful shrine, a photographer 's dream.","Visited in the pouring rain and still very nice shots. The temples have many very beatiful details and bronze work and painted wood. Traditional temple architecture and bronze and stone lantern posts. Visiting the temple requires many steep steps on stone stairs, you must have no physical handicaps. I think the shrine would be most beautiful at early sunset and after new snow, but even in the rain it was exceptional. I prefered it over the major shrines in Tokyo."
Wonderful!,"This is the real original burial place of Tokugawa Ieyasu the great shogun who determined Japan’s history for 350+ years, the Edo period. Everything we consider typically Japanese today originates from this era. The place itself is a jewel. Ieyasu’s grandchild considered this place to small and constructed Nikko, now overrun by tourist. Nikko is an inflated Kunozan without the atmosphere you can find here. Climbing the walkways inside the shrine complex one feels that this was the place were a big ruler got his peace to think over his realm.The place is undergoing major renovation now, but this is done in a clever manner so only small parts are inaccessible at a given time. Don’t miss it if you have a half day in the region."
Tranquility!,We took the stairs up as the cable car was not working. The climb is amazing. Takes about 20 minutes. The shrine is beautiful and peaceful. A great place to visit. The English audio guide is very useful if you want to know more.
A beautiful day out,"I ventured up to Nihondaira to get the ropeway to kunozan shrine. The shrine is stunning, and I spent a long time wondering around all of the structures taking in the beauty. There is also a museum which shows the shoguns that were there. From the ropeway centre observatory you also get fantastic views of Fuji on a clear day."
Like visiting Mt Vernon or Monticello,"First, after you arrive by ropeway/cable car, there are a lot of stairs; there is a museum with one flight of stairs but to see the rest, it was too difficult for my elderly mom.Otherwise, the history and beauty of the site was worth it.  500 yen for an English narration is a must!  Most of my Japanese history is from the Shogun mini-series so hopefully  it was enough background to understand the significance of the Tokugawa Ieyasu to Japanese.  Great for the history. On the other side of the  Nihondaira ropeway parking lot, follow the path for a breath view you won't forget.We took the bus from the Shizuoka Station.  If you need help, the Information desk there was great!"
Accesible via Nihomdaira ropeway,"A nice 5 minute ride took us down hill to the Toshogu Shrine.  When you arrive at the Shrine level, you will see a 500+ year old sacred tree which is identified by the paper and rope attached to it.  This Shrine was built after Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu passed away and is the first of many Toshogu Shrines built around Japan.  His tomb is located at the very top.  Lots of steep stairs to climb but worth it."
An exciting day trip from Nagoya or Tokyo,"Shizuoka Station is about an hour from Tokyo and 68 minutes from Nagoya by Shinkansen. I met a Japanese Facebook friend who lives in Florence, Italy for the first time there, and the tourist information center recommended us to go to Kunozan Toshogu. Both of us have been to the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, and we were curious what this Toshogu Shrine looks like at Kunozan. We obtained coupons at the information center, which helped us save a few dollars. We took a 10:30 bus from Gate No.11 at the North Exit of the station to get to Nihondaira (580 yen/40 minutes).  There are several buses running throughout the day. From Nihondaira, which is one of Japan's 100 most scenic spots where you can see Mt.Fuji, we took a cable car. The round trip costs 1,100 yen and with a coupon it is 990 yen. The ride is rather short (5 minutes) and expensive, but the beautiful scenery is worth it. (How many times can you experience this in your life time?) The other option was walking, and we did not want to do it on a hot summer day. The Shrine is located on top of Kunozan (270m) and it was constructed 19 years earlier than the one in Nikko. The scale, being on the mountain top, is not as big as the one in Nikko, but the architectures are beautiful. The main hall is a national treasure - is unique style, bright colors, and construction materials are gorgeous. There was a small exhibition box with Ieyasu's Gundam plastic model, too!!  Regular admission to the shrine is 500 yen but with a coupon it is 400 yen for adults. If you combine the Shrine and the museum, it is 800 yen (with coupon 700 yen).You can use the coupon for up to 5 people.The museum houses many items which the Tokugawa Shoguns owned. I especially liked Ieyasu's clock from Spain. There is a small shop-cafe near the museum, and my friend and i had matcha soft ice cream with Abakawa mochi (local sweets), sweet red beans, and corn flakes (400 yen) and ate the delicious dessert looking at the sky and the ocean from there. It was an exciting and relaxing trip."
Gorgeous day trip from Tokyo,"I wanted to do something out in the countryside for one day of my visit to Tokyo and, after asking around to some friends, settled on Nikko and the Toshogu Shrine. I booked a bus so I wouldn't have to navigate the Japanese train system even though I've heard that isn't actually very difficult to do, and I had a fantastic day. In many ways the shrine itself feels quite different from some of the others I've visited so that was neat and the lake up in the mountains that we also stopped at was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been with a remarkably calming vibe. I would go back in a heartbeat and highly recommend all of this."
Very beautiful shrine on mountain.,It is a spectacular shrine dedicated to Shogun and it was just very quiet and peaceful place on mountain.  Love to walk down another way to see the view of ocean.
Ieyasu was a little man.... so is this shrine,"I'm a history buff of the Sengoku period and so naturally I was excited to visit Ieyasu's shrine, but I definitely had grander expectations. The shrine itself is lovely and you can enjoy the architecture of the walls and buildings - though it should be stressed you're barred from entering any of them within the actual compound. Quickly you realize this trip is more a 30 minute detour that doesn't justify a trip in of itself, yet can adequately complement a larger more expansive trip. Some advice to travelers: you may also have checked and read about the nihondaira rope way and may plan to drop that into you trip to this shrine. Don't waste the money. The ropeway is a 5 minute descent to the shrine over a view of nothing but trees. It's like getting a closeup of broccoli. Also, suggest skipping the Tokugawa museum there - unless you're really keen to see Ieyasu's scissors and his bookshelf."
Good Scenery,"Go to there by ropeway 600 yen/way, 1100 yen/roundtrip. There is an historical shrine there but there is an admission fee so I didn't get into and unfortunately I went there in cloudy day so no much scenery to seeFurthermore, you can go down by foot around 11xx steps and can get the bus back to Shizuoka station there and around the bus stop there are a lot of strawberry shop and strawberry farm. Some farms you can go and for strawberry picking"
Excellent scenic stop,Really enjoyed our visit during Sakura season. It is a very impressive shrine and has a very intimate layout. Good for a two hour excursion.
Peace and Tranquility,You can access the shrine from the Nihondaira ropeway. It is a spectacular shrine dedicated to the Shogun and it was just very peaceful and calming. You can also purchase an extra admission to the museum which houses armor and rare artifacts. Just take bus no 42 from Shizuoka station and NIhondaira is the last stop. Tip: You can get a coupon from the information centre at shizuoka station for a discount at the shrine and ropeway
Do you know IEYASU TOKUGAWA?  It's possible to see a shrine of his grave and national treasure.,"Tokugawa Ieyasu is deified in Tosho-gu, it's a shrine. When he died in 1616, Tokugawa Ieyasu was reburied in Kunouzan Toshogu immediately. It's deified in Nikko Tosho-gu after that, but it's this place that there is a grave of Ieyasu. There isn't history museum in Shizuoka-shi, so to know Ieyasu deeply, I come to this place, and a museum, a grave and a shrine should be seen, and it's understood. Ieyasu wasn't 75 years old any more, but government by the shogunate beat Toyotomi Hideyoshi's child and Hideyori who spend 15 years from 60 years old by Shizuoka-shi and have in Osaka-jo, and fought and won to become in peace. After that I crossed to rule by the law made personally in 15 generations and about 260 years as a will, and peaceful government was brought to Japan. This time isn't called Tokugawa Period because there was Shogunate in Edo, and says the Edo Period. It's possible to see grand Mt. Fuji from Nihondaira on the day which cleared up. It's said that Japanese best is beautiful, so please come by all means."
Great view of the Pacific Ocean and a great place for history lovers,I went here October 2014. You could either climb up or have a cable car to bring you up the shrine. I decided to climb up during the solo trip.
