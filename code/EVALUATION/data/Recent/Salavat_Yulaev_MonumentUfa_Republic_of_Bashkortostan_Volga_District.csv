Nice panorama,"The place were the monument is located is awesome, it is on a hill facing upon the Belaia and the big forest. The monument it self is huge and nice. The place offers also a small park where kids can enjoy."
Monumental monument ,"On a snowy February evening we went to see the largest horse statue with a horse standing on three legs (!).  Funny but the horse - and rider, Bashkir hero, Salavat Yulaev - stands tight on the edge of a bluff facing the White River. So close that I couldn't get around to the front to take a better picture. Coming back when the snows gone and it's warm."
Great monument to visit while in town,"This is a great monument to visit while in town and its located next to other attractions, such as the senate building."
Very nice place to spend a few hours,"Monument itself is impressive. The park leading towards it is very well done, surroundings are nice and also the caffes's and shops under the yurts are a great authentic experience with local pastries, teas, interesting souvenirs and the sound of local music."
Symbol of Ufa,"The largest horse statue mounted on just three supports depicting a national hero of Bashkortostan is must-see. The park around is also good for outdoor activities. Recommended time of the year is Indian Summer, when you can see all the colours nature has to show behind  the picturesque Belaya river."
City break,Well worth a visit mainly to take in the magnificent views over the river and forest  below. Surround by fountains and flowers
Bashkort national hero,Spectacular views over the river and the country. Wonderful statue and gardens. Its in the old part of Ufa. Many activities going on there during summer.
BIG Warrior,"This is a very large equestrian statue with a very nice view from above the river. It doesn't take long to see, but makes for a pleasant short excursion."
Nice monument ,"Not a lot to say except it's in the centre of the city, has great views across the river and gives a commanding view of the locality.Lots of people come here to have their photo taken after getting married. Salavat is Bashkir sort of Robin Hood."

Wit a fantastic view,"This area around the Salavat Yulaev Monument offers a spectacular view over the Belaya river, a great outdoor area with fountains, the Congress Hall and in walking distance also the Old Muslim Cemetary, well worth a visit. Of course this area should be visited in spring, summer and autumn. The Salavat Yulaev Monument itself is very impressive, built in 1967 it stretches about 10 meters to the sky. One of the biggest horse-riding monuments in Russia, if not the biggest."
Main atraction of Ufa,You haven't been to Ufa if you don't visit this place. The view is great so if you have friends who like taking pictures or selfies then they will be satisfied here.
Ufa's the most popular attraction,Ufa's the most popular attraction. The statue of Savat Yulaev is the symbol of Ufa. Also local hockey team has the same name. The view near this statue pretty amazing
Looks great.,"Good looking monument, nice park around it. Great place to just walk around and look. Highly recommend for families (and future families)."
Wonderful Architecture,"Great place, with fountains and fantastic views of Belaya River. I go there quite often , and there's usually something new all the time."
Nice place and view,Highly recommend for visit. Nice view and history. In sunny weather - the best place to spent free time. Area is renovated and many people work around
Love this place!!!,"This is very beautiful place with panoramic view to the amazing city. Families, couples, friends, a lot of people go there every weekends and it's very nice watch them. If you want to see Ufa it's better to go there in the summer, because city very green at that time and you can try delicious tartarian food on the open restaurants."
Selfie-place,"One of the most popular selfie-places in Ufa. The great monument of national hero of Bashkortostan - Salavat Yulaev. It's located near the Congress Hall and ""Vatan"" park. Best place for walking."
Great Sites!,Could see the monument from the Government building we were in.  There equivalent of our George Washington representing a long ago movement.
A horse statue - so what?,"Ok, here's a thing for the brides in long gowns - apparently, in Ufa your marriage is not legal, if you were not photographed with your groom in front of this monument. For those not getting married in the city, it's just another horse statue. After all, no one knows what Yulaev really looked like."
Must see in Ufa,I was lucky to be looking at this monument from my hotel. I had very little time of and thus really appreciated the opportunity to see this monument. It is situated fantastically in a park in the river side
Hard to photograph,"Disappointing that it sits so close to the edge. However you photograph it, you can't get it from the front."
If you want to do nothing,Great panoramic view to river. Good place to walk alone or couple. One of symbol of Ufa and my childhood.
Wooow,One of the highlights of UFA city ! Nice to take a walk all around the city....Russia is breathtaking !Recommended !
nice place,"Great panoramic view, nice surroundings, good place to walk, to rest, to make a short visit.         ......."
Symbol of Ufa,Good place to walk alone or with kids. There are a few huts with non expensive tea and refreshments.
Must-visit,"Great panoramic view, nice surroundings, good for a short walk. There is a small souvenir shop in a formalized jurt."
Must see statue and few across the Ufa rivers,Great statue of hero from this region of the world.  Great views across the river. If you only go to Ufa for short stay then this is one place to go as a tourist.
Lovely place to visit,"Really enjoyed there. Lots of things to see and enjoy, the flowers, the monument, the panoramic view, but most importantly the lovely people!"
A picturesque place,"The horse of this sculpture is the biggest in Russia. The placement of the monument is very thoughtful - it is seen from all  the trains passing Ufa r/w bridge on the way from Moscow to Siberia.At night it looks really impressive,  being nicely illuminated. There's a restaurant in a neighbouring Congress Hall with a stunning river landscape and monument view."
One of the biggest Horseman Monuments in Europe,"Created in 1967 and rated #2 in EU the monument is still one of the biggest. The site is high over the bank of Belaya River and really wonderful - only a little restricted view on West - East and 20 to 40 km view South direction, supervising city surroundings, woodland hills, the Mouth of Dema river and Railway Bridge first constructed more than 110 yeras ago... Remembering our walks here in childhood and schoolyears we often visit the Monument now, wondering with colourful sunsets, small ships far below on the river in summer and and ski tracks on the ice and trees covered with hoarfrosy in winter... YES, it's surely must visit and maybe most remembered place in Ufa."
Nice sight seeing point,"Probably it is the best point to see the lower coast of the Belaya river. From the high place near monument you can see the Russian huge space, impressing autumn time especially"
Some extra things about Salavat Yulayev Monument,"There is actually a bunch of souvenir shops around worth visiting. Right before the monument there is ""yurt"" - a roundish tent. Prices are better than in the hotel. The best thing, actually, is to ask a guide to take you to the largest souvenir shop in city, which is right down the street. There you can take pictures in national Bashkir outfits for free.Decent English-speaking guides are found here ufatravelguide.ru"
Great views,"Simply no choice, but to visit this place while staying Ufa. I would recommend to go there early in the morning, when there are few people around - this will give a positive energy for the whole day. Or you can take a walk shortly before sunset, so you'll be able to take a look on the breathtaking scenery and on the way back enjoy lightened fountains."
Interesting place,Loved it! Great place at night))) good place to go before you head out to a club or bar. Great place for photos
