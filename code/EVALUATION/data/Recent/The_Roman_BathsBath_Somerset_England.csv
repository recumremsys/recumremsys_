Great,"Amazing  and lot's  of history. Absolutely  loved it. We spent 2,5 hours. Very recommended. Staff  is great and  helpful."
Enjoyable visit,"Enjoyable afternoon with knowledgeable staff. Tours felt a little rushed, but got the jist of the site history & a lovely kids pack for the youngest member of the family."
Visit Marred by Covid Regulations,"Although I completely understand and respect that covid regulations have to be in place and adhered to, I personally felt that this made our visit to the Roman Baths very monotonous and prolonged. In the museum you had to wait in a queue to view each exhibit which meant that you were either stuck there too long waiting for the people in front to move or feeling pressured to move quicker by the people behind. Whilst the history of the Roman Baths is interesting, I did begin to feel slightly bored because of the monotony of queuing and waiting, masks on for inside, off for outside, then back on again. Nevertheless, this is a important historical site and I'm glad I visited. Just be prepared to be patient!"
Great Day out,"A great attraction. Very informative using the free audio guide. Not to be missed, Social distances in place works well"
There's nowhere like this in the UK,"This is one-of-a-kind. There's nowhere like this in the UK. The baths are still in excellent condition and are absolutely beautiful. I normally have no time for tours, especially audio tours, but the information they provided was actually really good. Each recording was around 2 minutes so not too long but you still felt like you got the important bits. It couldn't have been easier to operate.There was plenty of hand sanitiser around but I felt like in serveral areas, there were no staff so people were left to police themselves and there weren't people to enforce social distancing.The gift shop had a good selection of things.Overall, if you don't go here when you're in Bath, you're crazy!"
Stunning!,"A must see when coming to Bath! Fantastically managed during the current climate, audio guides are excellent. Staff really good and a well spent hour or two."
worth the cost,"informative & interesting, worth visiting and seeing the artefacts, that are housed in there - very unexpected!"
A must see exhibit ,"You have to try the Roman baths when in Bath don't you. I'm really glad we did, the magnificent building and living spa take you back centuries and the attention to detail was incredible, please give it a go"
Excellent Visit,"An informative and enjoyable visit at the Roman Baths. Thoroughly recommend, even if a little pricey."
God bless The Romans. ,"What can I say that hasn’t been said in the last 2,000 years? Needs to be seen to be appreciated. It’s worth the entrance fee as the tour is 90 minutes and the education you receive will last a lifetime. JUST GO!"
Well laid out.  Very informative - Simply Excellent,"Facilities have improved since our last visit.  So well laid out and the audio guides (included in the price ) are really good.  I particularly liked the Bill Bryson versions.Clean, well excavated but understandably uneven surfaces.  a great visit and thoroughly recommended ."
Interesting,"A very interesting place to visit and a must if you are in Bath. Hand held information 'phones' are provided and are easy to use. A difficult time to visit due to Covid restrictions but many areas were closed off and no mention of this when booking so was quite disappointed to have not been told, still charged full price for the tickets, and asked if I would like to make a donation! The real let down was some of the staff. As always, some were lovely and really helpful, but there were a few, who were clearly bored and therefore just stood in their spots watching (staring at) you which was very off putting."
Good informative tour,"Visited during a wet Tuesday afternoon. Booked tickets online. Tour good & interesting. Definitely worth a visit. While staff where observing felt safe with social distancing measures, however when they wasn’t felt uneasy at people getting too close! Less than 1 metre at times. Overall would recommend but suggest more staffing if possible as not all visitors observed social distancing."
Bath baths,"Very interesting tour , make sure you have one of their handsets (supplied free) so much is explained as you go round."
Incredible step back in time,"If you're a history buff then this is definitely a place to visit. The preservation of the baths is outstanding. You are guided on a journey (use the audio guide for extra info) through time on a path throughout the baths. Even during Covid times, sanitation stations are available at regular stops, staff are friendly and helpful. A definite must!"
"Must see attraction, no point visiting Bath if you do not come here!","Incredibly interesting part of Baths history and a MUST SEE. This is the only hot spring in the entirety of the UK, as they are usually associated with places with more geothermic and volcanic activity (New Zealand, Japan etc).The Roman engineering is breathtaking even when looked at today, considering how they utilised the hot water spring to fill up the large bath in the central court yard and a variety of rooms spread throughout the bath complex.Its a trip back in time with you have to descend down flights of stairs to reach what would have been street level for the ancient Romans.Helpful audio commentary is available for every language and even a humorous commentary provided by author Bill Bryson is available."
Great for a break from the rain,Had an interesting day at the Roman baths . Pre booked tickets and arrived and was directed to collect tickets. Amazing building . We’re given a hand held device for information. Very informative and felt safe with the controls put in place . A unique experience.
Really interesting tour,"You can't visit Bath without seeing the Roman Baths. I was able to book a visit for later the same day - pre-booking online is essential at the moment due to the Covid 19 restrictions in place.Great Covid measures in place throughout although that does mean a small number of areas are closed off, presumably as otherwise there would be bottlenecks in places. The free audio guide is excellent, with musings from Bill Bryson available as well as the purely factual guides. There are also actors on site who help bring the place to life and engage with visitors.The exit via the gift shop is optional and there's a good range of items available to suit all pockets.I really enjoyed the tour and found it fascinating to find out about the history of the place through the ages."
Little piece of history,Very informative & enjoyable. Good system in place during these strange times. Easy to book. Feeling like we stepped back in time briefly
Going back in time,"If you ever spend a few days in Bath the Roman Baths is a must, we booked online so not to be disappointed on the day ,Covid rules apply and are maintained very well, you walk around with a hand held phone that you can either listen to by putting your ear to it or bring your own ear phones. The 1 way tour is great, the info from the phone is not too long, enough time to listen and look before moving on.Walking around the place you can imagine you have gone back in time and with costume characters walking around it just adds to the experience. Feel the heat from the water as it comes up from the ground and travels away to the river AvonDon’t miss this great historical place it’s a must. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did"
Was a little underwhelmed ,Visited yesterday it was good to see the baths preserved and the history behind them but I did feel slightly underwhelmed as some parts of the exhibit were closed off probably because social distancing would have difficult. We were a little frustrated by other visitors in relation to lack of social distancing but this seems to be the norm everywhere. I suspect our visit at 3pm was a quieter time so it did only take about an hour to get round.
Not to be missed,"We booked tickets and time slot online which was very easy to do. Took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes to go round.  Very informative not boring.  Would recommend,"
A step back to a different world,Just incredible to see how the Romans went about their daily lives. Some quite magnificent artefacts to see
Really enjoyed our visit,You didn't get to see everything due to the cocoa restrictions but still a fantastic place to visit.
Ruined by certain people ,The staff and site have done an excellent job in these annoying times. Everything is laid out clearly and explained well. As always it’s really interesting even on my third visit and loved the photos now laid out showing previously unseen footage. It’s explained you can go past people just be courteous. Here lies the issue. Today we had to suffer an old man constantly standing in the middle of the isle ways talking to his grandchild. With a cue forming behind him his wife asked him to move only for him to be rude about people going past him!!! What excellent work the staff do gets ruined by inconsiderate people with a large dose of self importance! So please do visit and it’s wonderful place and the staff are trying. Just please remember in the new system to stay to one side so people working at a different pace can safely come by and not stand in the middle of the narrow isles.
Fascinating ,"What an absolute pleasure to have been able to visit such a historical site. The hand held information phones, which allow you to choose what you want to know more about were perfect, as my husband and I could listen at our own leisure on what interested us ."
Stunning ,Well with the £23 per head.  The have perfected the art of illustrating what the Baths looked like almost 2000 years ago through animated videos.Great audio information system.
Great visit,This was our third visit but I feel you can't visit Bath without dropping in here.  Thoroughly enjoyable and felt safe with the covid restrictions.
Roman Baths experience,"Very enjoyable visit, even though weather was terrible with heavy rain. Amazing to think how old this site is and in such great condition.Interesting and informative with good social distances in place."
Great but rushed.. ,Must see location in Bath! Very fun and educational. Only thing is - if you book an afternoon session you will be rushed to finish it ASAP as they close at 6. Initially we didn’t mind but that was because we didn’t expect there would be so much to be seen! So be mindful this attraction takes at least 2.5 hours to be enjoyed without feeling like you’re skipping loads of interesting spots! Audio guides are great!
Informative!,A really pleasant experience being able to walk around the one way system mostly at your leisure with the ear pieces provided that you use like a phone to get a commentary on the different artifacts around the site. It was quite a large place aswell surprisingly so it was a 90 minute or so stroll around. My partner obviously wanted to jump in to the main pool but not allowed and one person who dipped their hand in was quickly chastised and required to wash and sanitise!
Weekend break,"Well worth a visit and a good way to spend an hour or so, I think the price was expensive and should be reduced during the winter months and during Covid due to restrictions."
A must do in Bath,Booked to do the tour whilst in Bath for a few days. I have to say it was worth the wait in the pouring rain. Even with the COVID-19 restrictions it was a good experience.The phone things you have to take around with you which inform you of what you are looking at were a good touch.The baths tour was larger and more in depth than I thought it would have been which was a nice surprise.I'd recommend this to anyone visiting Bath.
Very good ,You cant swim there. It's a museum but very nice and interesting.  Good history. It takes about an hour with audio guide (included in price). Highly recommended!
Very interesting!,"This was far more to it than we thought it would be, well worth doing! We loved the little portable guide, very informative!"
Brilliant tour.,"Best tour I have been on, informative, interesting, didn’t get bored, well thought out even with the current restrictions, would highly recommend this when visiting bath. Afternoon tea in the pump room was outstanding."
A Piece of history,"loves the roman baths you have to pre book your tickets on line due to covid and only attend at your time slot, wonderful to think the romans stood and bathed where we were"
Worth a visit,Very interesting but found  wearing masks throughout a challenge and was not made clear on the website before booking !  Found it difficult to move around  but appreciate its difficult times
Very Interesting,"We were given audio phones that give a description of the area we were looking at. Each point has a number you key in so that all the audio is at your own pace. Even with all the covid restrictions,  it was not busy and a very relaxing and interesting tour."
Roman Baths ,"Fabulous place to visit, COVID-19 secure, really good that you get given a hand held listening guide."
Very informative,Very informative and fun visit to the baths. The walk around is supported by audio description devices which have options for multiple languages and for children. Well worth the visit.Covid restrictions in place are not too obtrusive. Masks can be taken off in the open areas etc
A must see when in bath,"Amazing informative visit to the Roman Baths . Liked the visual interpretations of what life was like back then .The Romans were so clever and ahead of their time regarding inventions. Plenty of modern day provisions like sanitiser ,social distancing etc."
Great Historical Treat,Loved our visit here. Can’t come to Bath and not see the baths. Learnt lots and walked the path of Pilgrims. Felt very special to see such history! A must see.
Roman baths at bath.,Roman baths were excellent. After speaking with a member of staff I was given a phone number to book tickets on my credit card.(I do not have or want an I phone). He very kindly booked my tickets and had them waiting at the entrance at an agreed time. Well worth 2 hours of anyone’s time.
Dragged out,"After having to queue past our time slot we went in. About half the hand sanitisers were out of liquid and the confined space meant you can only travel as fast as the group in front. After about 45min of looking at ancient bricks you eventually get to the baths bit. On this day that included stepping over a lady who was receiving help from the paramedics. They had put up a screen on one side for privacy but the poor woman was being gawked at the other side, this side was backed up due to the groups listening to the boring audio guide.Overall we were in there for about 90 min to look at something which could have taken 15 minutes."
Loved it!,Absolutely breathtaking and mind blowing. Expect to spend at least a couple hours if you want to explore everything in detail. At the end you get to sample the special water that Bath was known for (FYI it tastes sorta like rust)
You can feel the history,Love the way this is set up. Audio guide really useful. You are in some places walking where the Romans walked. Reasonable price for a larger exhibit than I thought. Helpful staff. Good Covid preparations in keeping with the history.
Very interesting ,"Me and my husband visited here today, we found it very interesting and informative.It took us about one and a half hours to walk round."
Historic site ,Roman built baths become a World Heritage site in 1987. You should visit this amazing place. Free audio guide.
Great insight to the history ,We was a little apprehensive about our trip but the organisation and layout is fantastic. Other than a few areas which were closed due to not been able to social distance. Everything else was open and the audio guide is included and is a brilliant aid
"Informative, but overpriced",Lovely place and very informative. My boyfriend and I bought student tickets but it was still £20 each which for what it is is ridiculous. We enjoyed it just some bits were closed. Good COVID precautions taken. Overall good just should be cheaper
Must see ,If you come to Bath you should take the time to book this as it’s a fascinating insight into Baths history and The Romans extraordinary engineering ability . Audio descriptions provided on entrance . Not suitable for infirm .
Cool history but a bit boring,"The best part of visiting is seeing the hot spring, the overflow, sluice gate, and all the treasures found in the drains. It’s almost too much to take in. I think we were all overwhelmed by the experience, but we were glad to have the audio guide to help us learn so much. Of course, it would be possible to just sail through without learning as much, but I would hate to miss so many of the details that we picked up along the way."
Very well organised,Given all the guidelines on social distancing etc. I was pleasantly surprised how well the Roman Baths have managed to get visitors back through their doors. Plus their audio guide that you control using the numbers shown throughout your visit is one of the best I have come across. Not only was it extremely informative but had changes in the delivery that meant you didn't get bored listening to the same voice throughout.Expect a few pressure points as you walk around there are some area's that would be more interactive that they have had to keep closed and some people go faster than others so you may have to wait in the museum area's a bit longer than you may want to but the whole site is well organised and made us feel very safe.
Well worth a visit,"We visited The Roman Baths on 18th September. It was a bit of a worry having a 15 minute timed entry slot, so we booked for the afternoon to make sure we had plenty of time to arrive as travelling from Gloucester. The entry queues were well organised. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Covid precautions in place. The audio guides were cleaned before being given to us. It wasn't too crowded and there was plenty of time to look around and listen to the audio information. Well worth a visit."
The Jewel in Bath's Crown!,"What an amazing place! Having visited as a child, I was excited to see it again. Great credit must go to the staff for their dedicated covid-control measures, although the receptionist repeated the instructions to each couple/group rather than to the whole tranche going in at the same time.The audio guide was excellent, giving contextual, historical and archaeological information. The site is sensitively preserved, and you can close your eyes and imagine you are back in Roman times."
Re: Fabulous!,"We loved the Roman Baths. My family and I visited early on the morning of Saturday 26th, very good COVID guidance. The early slot was definitely worth going for. Our visit was made extra special by the Roman lady! She made the whole exhibition, very clever. My husband a traditional builder was fascinated by all of the old mortars."
"Great history, stunning grounds - good for families","Well planned out with covid restrictions in place, one way system etc. You must book in advance which we did. We arrived at the end of our slot which was great as we walked straight in but the queue for the next slot was really long. Free audio telephone things to listen about the history. These were heavy around your neck - would prefer headphones (after covid perhaps). The staff inside were excellent. Our daughter is studying romans in school and we thought this would be great for her learnings - they gave us some really cool, unusual roman facts which she is eager to share with her classmates! Marked down 1* as they didn't give us children packs at entrance, or explain children can listen to their own child's channel which was better for younger listeners. A lady called up for an activity pack for the kids to be given to us which was cool. We weren't advised about the toilets at the beginning either so alf way through they needed the loo which was problematic as they were at the end. That being said, staff were great and helped us through and back in again without walking through and missing everything. Overall, we really enjoyed it! Parking is a bit of a weird one but there are plenty around... make sure you have maps on your phone to then find the baths!"
A must see when you are in Bath!,A well maintained and partially restored Roman bath and the adjacent constructions. You enjoy the viewing with the audio description of the monument.  It gives a good picture what was happening in the roman time. The viewing is well organised by the staff. You need to prebook your admission ticket.
Enjoyable,"Enjoyable way to spend 90mins - interesting audio tour.Some areas were closed, presumably for COVID social distancing but still enjoyed the visit.It's quite expensive - but pleased  I've been"
Great visit,I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. I had prebooked a time and we went in as planned. There was plenty of space and social distancing and everything was managed to enhance the experience effectively. A great visit.
Beautiful and well organised,"We were a bit worried about what the experience would be like given the variable nature of the reviews during COVID19. However we loved our visit. We arrived 15mins before our 10:00 booking and they had 2 queues, out time and for the next booking. People in the queue respected social distancing. Each couple / group was let in 1 at a time to collect their audioguides. We tend to take our time listening to the guides and were worried would hold people up but there are places to allow others to pass. The restoration is beautiful and it must have been amazing during Roman times. As you can see from photos due to social distancing it is pretty empty as numbers limited compared to normal times."
Tee0473,Our first visit to the Roman Baths..  There's so much to see.. and learn and experience  for all ages.. Very covid conscious which is good.. need to book too with helps with numbers.. Very informed staff to help when needed .. A trip back in time ..
Very goid,"Visited yesterday, very good visit, highly informative and interesting and felt very safe re.covid guidelines"
A well thought out (and Covid aware) experience,The Baths are worth every penny of the entrance charge. Fascinating history clearly presented via the audio guide with well informed staff available for other questions.A really enjoyable visit.
MAGNIFICENT VISITOR EXPERIENCE,This was my first visit for many years and I was very impressed.  Excellent audio guide. The exhibition area has been refurbished over the last few years and there really is a lot to see.  One came away feeling that one had a much better understanding of life in Roman Bath.   This really is a unique place and a must see for anyone coming to Bath.
Very enjoyable! ,"I really enjoyed the tour! I ended up listening to the children’s tours all the way through it was very informative! They did a great job considering the rules and regs at the moment! If your going to bath, you have to got the baths!"
Well preserved,"Completely covid safe, well organised and interesting trip. We received a mobile phone like device in which we could listen to audio by dialing numbers found throughout the tour. The audio is mixed between languages and also included recordings from the site manager. This is one of those trips where it is what you make of it. Some people rushed through taking a couple of pictures whilst others took time to listen to the audio and appreciate the Roman artifacts in front of them.The baths are stunning and an incredible piece of architecture for their time.Would recommend"
Good and COVID-safe,"We weren’t sure how this was going to work given the current circumstances but, actually, it was well organised and we felt comfortable throughout the visit. The tour of the Baths is self directed using hand-held audio devices, which are cleansed before use. It was quite busy but we didn’t feel rushed or constrained. The Baths themselves are fascinating and well-preserved although some areas are currently off-limits. There are some uneven areas so those with walking issues should take care. The shop is the usual haven of tourist tat."
Spa time 2000 years ago,"A must visit to see the Roman Baths ,while in Bath very interesting and informative ,as we went round we typed in numbers and were given talks about that part of the tour"
Didn't tell us about the bath cleaning,"Such an amazing place with a deep historical background. Didn't expect to be led underground through the streets as I had no idea the the romans built in this far, what an amazing experience. Only problem was the baths had no water in as they were being cleaned and I didn't see this stated on the website so it was slightly mundane. However, we will return at a later date when the baths are  full as it's a great experience."
Organised and Interesting tour.,"We had a great tour of the Roman Baths. We were booked in for the 10:00 tour (you can only book online at the moment so need tickets when you arrive). Entry was well organised with all Covid 19 requirements in place. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. We took our own headphones for the audio tour, which was easy to use and very informative. Being on an early booking we didn't have many people around us so had space and time to enjoy the tour and take in the history.Overall the tour was well organised, informative and enjoyable - a must do in Bath."
A slice of Roman history,"Entered by pre-booked timed ticket.  Asked if you wished to use the toilets first, in which case it was one in, one out for the Gentlemen’s toilets for everyone.  Rather disconcerting walking past the urinals!  Unfortunately the Baths are still a rather busy tourist attraction and we had to shuffle along, keeping our distance from the people in front of us.  A slow progress the whole way round.  My husband listened to the audio handset which he said was very good, especially Bill Brysons comments.  I am not sure whether we missed anything due to COVID rules but we eventually got down to the actual Baths which were very interesting.  One Roman actor that we met was very good and kept his conversation with us in character the whole time.  Just before reaching the shop, we were asked again if we wished to use the loo, but better there than trying to find one in Bath at large.  The shop had a lot in it, but was quite expensive.  Bought the guide for £5.  I would only say that I do think the £21 ticket each was rather a lot but when in Rome ( oops Bath) one just has to do it, once!"
Visit ,"Visited the Baths with my husband recently. All safety measures for covid where in place.. well organised... a visit to the baths is a must ,very interesting and informative.staff were very knowledgeable"
A nice day out,Very interesting and well thought out. It was hard work in the COVID  socially distanced queues with masks at times but that’s not their fault. Lovely staff
Living history.,"The roman baths have been on .y bucket list for as long as I can remember and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Layer,upon layer of epic history are laid out before you and superbly presented by an obviously caring team."
Great Experience ,Thoroughly enjoyed a 2 hour tour of the Roman Baths. Very informative and well worth a visit. I would highly recommend.
Excellent Tour,Worth going to see.  It is very informative.  Go to Sally Lunns for a bun afterwards.  It is the oldest house in Bath!
Clever romans ,"Visited here for what I thought would be a 20/30 minute tour.  Actually it takes about 90mins and so offers excellent value for money.  Intriguing insight into the Roman baths, their beliefs and the hot spring.  Plenty of photo opportunities and we found the whole place fascinating and much bigger than we expected"
"Great, very well managed social distancing","After seeing recent reviews about how busy it was due to strict social distancing causing long waits I was really worried about our visit as I get claustrophobic and struggle with a lot of queuing however, I was so relieved as it was so well managedWe visited on a sunny Sunday and online tickets were sold out all day, it was not at all overcrowded, everyone was in masks, I am exempt, I did get asked at every point you go past a staff member but I just mouthed i'm exempt and they said oh sorry and let me go. It didn't make me feel awkward at all like some other places didWe got around in about an hour, we went through the museum and all parts, we didn't skip or rush anything. I do think it's a little overpriced for a 1 hour attraction however it may have taken longer had we listened to the audio tour, unfortunately the audio thing we were given didn't work but it was too lat to go back once we realised due to the one way systemOverall we both really enjoyed it and would recommend"
More than I expected,"If I am honest, Roman history doesn't really get me that excited, after all what did they do for us?  But when in Bath ... What a fantastic and informative exhibition.  Far from having dull monotonic audio guides this was an interesting subversive experience.  The guides were easy to follow, and the Bill Bryson pieces reminded you of the cultural importance of what you were seeing.  There was so much to see that you really get an idea of the complete role and purpose of the site to the Roman people.(Take your own headphones to avoid having to hold the audio guide to your ear.)"
History live!,Amazing to see roman history actually live!  Worth the money hut don't try and share the audio listening devices it doesn't work!  Anyway great value and lovely visit!
Excellent visit,"Myself and my partner thoroughly enjoyed visiting the Roman Baths! One of the most safe places I have visited during the Coronavirus pandemic, all staff were wearing masks and visors, there was a staff member guiding people through ensuring people weren’t gathered together and everybody was spaced out. I felt entirely safe and will definitely come back for another visit when we can get the full experience."
Have to do ,It was something you have to do because your in Bath . Found it slightly boring at times . Not keen on the tour elements but because of COVID you have to adhere to it.  Found the atmosphere inside humid with having to wear a mask.
Fascinating,"I have done the Roman Baths tour on several occasions over the past 30 years or so but clearly this time, with covid precautions at the forefront of everyone's minds, it was going to be different.We had had to book in advance and the waiting areas were clearly marked out in our allotted times.  Outside felt as normal but wearing masks inside, coupled with the rather over the top instructions from the guides, we felt it was extremely claustrophobic as we shuffed along the exhibit areas and in all honesty, I was losing the will to live until we reached the open air again.  That said, the views are amazing and we were blessed with equally amazing weather.  There were two actors playing the parts of Romans visiting the baths to add atmosphere to the surroundings.As we finished the tour, we were automatically guided into the shop which was all overpriced (who would buy a Roman centurion's helmet for £85?) and probably geared to the non-existent foreign tourists."
Amazing history and architecture,Beautiful Roman baths with so much history and you can really feel this when you walk around. Everyone was social distancing.  I loved being able to touch the stonework and  sense the history and  appreciate all those thousands of years ago. The hot springs bubble up and this was a sight to see. Lovely experience  x💜
Very interesting.,This was a very interesting experience. The baths themselves are beautiful. All the exhibits before the baths are well displayed and the audio guide is very informative. The only downside for me was having to wear a mask as it was a very hot day but I’m glad the baths are able to open again as they are well worth a visit.
Could be better but good,Me and my family we’re so excited to see this historic beauty after such a long time. Living under  the bath and north east Somerset meant that we were able to go for free. However when we first arrived the staff questioned whether we were part of the district. Although we showed sufficient evidence we were still met by an ignorant and arrogant response from the staff. We almost get that it could be due to our ethnicity but we let it slide. Shocked by this we still kept persistent until they let us in finally. Once we went through we then realised that they didn’t tell us about the audio guides we were meant to have which led to us spending part of the tour having no idea what was going on. Other than that the actual place is beautiful and really worth it.
Incredibly informative trip to Roman Baths ,"Came here with another couple for what was incredibly informative and stunning to look at. I never thought i would have enjoyed myself so much at a historical sight. The views were incredible and the audio guides given out were brilliant, very easy to use and listen to on each section of the museum whilst you walked around. If you havent been to the Roman Baths, i would highly suggest a visit!"
Mini Holiday ,"Fantastic place to visit. Well layed out with an excellent audio guide. Limited numbers due to Covid mean booked tickets only and a timed slot, so less busy and easier to see. A must see in Bath and did not disappoint."
Posh public baths,"Was so looking forward to going as it was our first visit. The cost wasn’t reduced despite the sauna, steam rooms etc being shut. So £80 per couple for use of the two pools. The staff were functional, but what surprised me was that the paint work in areas of the pool and changing room was tired, there were bits broken in the toilets. The changing rooms are not dissimilar to council run baths! The showers are not even on the same floor as lockers so had to traipse up and down stairs with all my stuff when getting changed. Wouldn’t go again."
Interesting,"We enjoyed our visit; it was just over 1.5 h, helpful audioguide, very interesting. Easy to book it, not overcrowded."
An excellent example of ancient history preserved & presented in an appropriate way. ,An excellent day out. The commentary is very informative & interesting. Organised well to keep to Covid restrictions
Amazing and interesting visit,"This visit was so much more than what I expected. I visited the Roman Baths with my partner during a trip to Bath and we felt we couldn’t visit Bath without a trip to the Baths, and so glad we did. It was fascinating to hear and read about the history of the Baths, and quite amazing to see all the pools, brick work and more! It’s one of those places, once you’ve seen it you don’t really need to see it again, but will definitely be recommending it to family and friends. Lots of hand alcohol gel around the museum, Social distancing all in place, felt safe, even with many people walking around. A brilliant day out!"
Perfect History ,What a lovely tour!And with the pandemic going on all instructions were easy to see and understand Would definately recommend to others
Very interesting tour,"Visited Bath for a few days break and booked this visit in advance, together with a walking tour. What a brilliant way to spend a few hours listening to the history of this wonderful city. Inside the Baths, social distancing was observed throughout even though it was very busy. I highly recommend this tour and if possible arrange for the walking tour too."
Disappointed ,"Ladies - don’t be surprised when you are asked to use the gents toilets!  Sorry I understand these are strange times given covid 19 but this to me is one step too far.  Why - is it just to save time cleaning - most other places can offer toilet facilities!Staff stood about - only policing 2 metre rule, no other interaction with visitors.  The radio devices have pictures on so you can see what it is talking about - but when you are listening you can’t see the pictures! Lol.Even asking to purchase a guide book I was made to feel like an inconvenience. Sorry not for me - perhaps once we get rid of covid it might be worth a return but not until!"
Baths in Bath.,A brilliant visit to the Roman Baths with an audio guide.Much more than just the bath that you see on the telly or what is used as the main picture. Took the morning up which meant we had the afternoon free to explore Bath.It's a one way system so you will not miss anything and you could look round at your own pace.Online booking is essential
Very well organised,"This is one of the best historical sites i have been to and very well organised. The entrance price is worth every penny, really enjoyable and a must see when visiting Bath."
Fabulous visit,"Impressive as one would expect, social distancing maintained in all areas, would recommend at the moment as possibly quieter than usual."
Amazing ,"A must to see and thoroughly enjoyed the commentary on the personal hand held devices, it certainly helps us to understand how the past bathers in Bath enjoyed exactly what we love too do."
One way system not good ,"Nice and interesting visit.  Baths are well maintained and you learn lots of things However, the one way system was terrible. I understand this is due to COVID-19 and of course they have to keep everyone safe.  But the queue are long and you have to wait for people to finish reading before you can go ... so if you are behind someone that wants to learn every details you are stuck for ages ...  Maybe reducing the capacity of people might help. so I would recommend visiting this place but maybe once Restrictions are over."
Amazing history tour,The system during covid was great- clear marks on the floor where people should keep their distance- most obeyed- everyone wore a mask indoors. The portable electric guide was great to listen to on the tour. Loved the actress’s who were sat by the bath in Roman outfits- would have been even better if all the staff were dressed up- I did joke to my husband that it would be even more authentic if everyone had to wear a toga while walking around- would make great photos :)All in all a really enjoyable hour and half and highly recommended.
Good organised,"Good organised visit to the Roman baths , we did after pre book due to COVID 19 , and it was a one way system but felt safe , you get a free audio to learn all about the history and facts . The tour took about 90 mins .All staff we met along the way round was very friendly."
Pre-book to avoid disappointment ,"This is probably the number one thing to do in Bath, and for good reasons. Really enjoyed the visit and you get a free audio guide which really helps to absorb the experience. Due to a COVID-19 you have to pre book your tickets and there is a one way system where flow is controlled by staff to keep everyone safe. They did a really good job. Well worth a visit!"
Worth a visit ,The tour is approx 90 minutes duration . It is worth a visit but it’s slow going if you’re behind someone who wants to listen to every detail of every fact !
Better with Covid rules,"Booked tickets, short queue to get in, audio guide included. All regularly wiped etc. One way route through with some queuing to keep distances meant the tour took nearly 2 hours, which is what made it special. Plenty of time to listen to the audio guide, and view the baths and all the discovered history, excavations, developments in the 18th century and later. Video projections with actors, onto walls help to bring the history to life. Huge site, so much more than just a big central bath. Honestly if you do nothing else in Bath, you need to this. And give yourself the time."
Must see attraction,"Excellent and unique must see attractions in Bath, is fascinating to learn the history of the Roman Baths, the free audio guide provides extra information too"
Expected more,"We enjoyed the Roman Baths but honestly expected it to be better. We visited during Covid so inevitable queues, which meant we had plenty of time to listen to all the audio stops around the Baths using the handheld 'phone' device. However I just found it difficult to follow, didn't feel all that informed on leaving and just felt a little deflated. I was also disappointed there was no prewarning we were visiting on one of their 6-weekly cleans, so the Baths were very mucky. Surely there should be some kind of warning or discount as it really takes away from the experience."
Interesting visit,"Due to Covid we booked ahead, there were quite a few hand sanitizer stations, one thing we were surprised by, we were given audio guides but no disposable gloves which we had supplied at a previous attraction. One problem with the social distancing is that you can only browse at the speed of the people in front of you, in our case the queue was slow, some of the areas were not available to view. Regardless we had an enjoyable time and fully recommend a visit if you're in the vicinity."
Culture,"It was good to see some culture within Bath. We precooked and the Receptionist did explain to us there there is a one way system and there will be some queueing. Handheld sets to walk with, which explained the history of the Baths as well as other information. The queues were long; but this didn’t bother us as we had time to both look and listen to each audio snippet without being ushered forward."
Pre-booking advised,A very interesting trip as always to the baths. If you would like to visit during COVID then do make sure you book in advance. It seems very rare to be able to get tickets on the day. Having a queuing system in place around the baths does work and allows you to have time to view parts without crowds. Crowds could be managed better on the top balcony where numerous visitors ignore the queue and just cut the line.
Weekend Trip to Bath,"This is a must see! Currently you need to pre-order your tickets due to COVID and you show up at that specific time. You do need to follow the queue but it’s not too bad. Overall, was still amazing to see such a intact piece of history!"
Lovely visit,"Visited with my daughter. We had a lovely wander around, listening to the audio chat as we went. It was limited entry so was ideal for us to be able to see everything.Very enjoyable."
Good visit ,Great visit. Very interesting. Had a phone you walk around with and you select information to hear.Lots of waiting however this is what has to happen with Covid.A must see in Bath.
Worth a visit,"A most interesting place but words of caution should be observed: don't, under any circumstances, try the water!"
Very good experience,"A superb museum and visually stunning. Well preserved and maintained roman baths. Useful free commentary. Understandably does take a while to navigate around the place, due to Covid measures, but well organised.Book online!"
Brilliant,Very interesting visit. Top marks for the social distancing measures currently in place. Lots of sanitiser points. The audio tour was great.
Highly recommend,This is probably the coolest roman thing I’ve ever seen! Amazing how much of it is still in tact. Well worth the money going by the amount of time spent in there. Was a bit gutted that the main bath was drained for cleaning but that’s just my luck.Highly recommend
Must do,Very well run although a few rooms were unfortunately roped off. The audio guide was very informative and at some stops had a Bill Bryson version.I think social distancing may make the experience better as you get space to look at each item without someone’s phone or camera pushed in front of you and have a booked time slot for arrival. Actually I may visit some more museums during social distancing
Interesting to say the least,Never knew there was so much to this place. Wow ho interesting and what an amazing job the Romans did with just bare hands. Well worth the fee for entry. And how can you visit Bath and not go to see the Roman Baths!
Roman baths ,Pre book your tickets is advisable but definitely worth a visit to discover about its heritage and the Romans. The narrations you listen to enable you to understand more of its history.
Queues! ,"We got there quite early so not totally overcrowded. However, other people lingering in doorways and taking a long time at each sign post made it a bit frustrating. Not to mention the daggers they gave us if we tried to get past and move onto an empty area as we didn’t want to wait for them to finish listening to their audio guide or reading the information that we had long finished. Need passing places to get around people who would like to enjoy the exhibits for longer. The baths were very beautiful and interesting but the ticket price was way overpriced."
summer road trip,"great time here lots to see and very well  layed out place staff great ,covid thing not to bad as most of , if not all the baths are open to see"
Great visit,"Really enjoyed our visit to the Baths. Well worth going. Most interesting, the audio commentary was very good and the kids were most interested and really liked the time there."
Underwhelming ,"Though understanding the present times brings its own complications, we were unimpressed with the amount of standing around waiting to move on. Although the baths themselves were interesting it was impaired by the feeling of being herded around. Would be better if they increased the time between tours so as you could go round the exhibitions at own pace."
Few days away,Due to covid restrictions I think the price should have been more reflective of this... Hefty cost to walk in lines.. Many areas not accessible too.. Not all bad as what we did see was good and interesting
Wonderful and Extensive,"We were worried the tour would short and underwhelming, but the museum was extensive and we loved seeing all of the different rooms and sections to the baths. The audio tour was very well done and really brought the baths to life. I highly recommend visiting!"
Bath time!,"Had a great time at the Roman baths today. Really educational and the audio commentary was great. It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to go round, due to large numbers and Covid spacing."
Must see when visiting Bath,"First visit to Bath and thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Roman Baths. Pre booking tickets required. Very interesting, good audio guide. Staff helpful. Lots to see well worth a visit."
Don’t waste your time or money,"Overpriced.Due to the Covid restrictions you essentially spend an hour and a half queueing to get out.No time to enjoy the experience or immerse yourself in the history.They let too many people in and because of that the highlight of the tour was the way out.Not to mention, your whole experience involves lapping the same 2 Baths 3 times."
Beautiful,"Full of history, the Roman baths are beautiful. Really helpful free audio guides that explained everything."
Covid-19 restrictions accepted but way too many allowed in,"Visited on Monday morning.  I'm sure I'd have enjoyed this great exhibition had the organisers resisted letting in quite so many visitors.  I know tourist sites have been anxious to re-open and get in some revenue, and I also know that tourist sites (and all other public sites) have new, strict social-distancing guidelines to adhere to during the Covid-19 pandemic.  But here they let in too many people and we spent more time standing, looking at a blank wall, not having anything to listen to on our audioguides,  waiting to shuffle six feet to the next floor marker, than actually seeing and appreciating the exhibition.  And the toilet situation was impossible.  NOT a happy experience though I'd like to go again someday when the restrictions are eased or the Baths organisers figure out that fewer visitors would be happier visitors."
Interesting visit,Well laid out and plenty to see. Good audio tour with extra information if you want to learn more.  A must when visiting Bath.
Amazing trip,The roman baths was such an interesting place to visit and so well preserved. Staff were also  very friendly and attentive and were more than happy to answer any questions we had. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Bath and can't wait to come again.
Really interesting history,Booked in on a Sunday morning before the queues. The audio device was really useful. Had a commentary by different people include Bill Bryson. Took about 1-5 hours if you listen to all the audio too.  You don't get a chance to take a dip which is a shame.
If you have hours .......,"Very interesting and much improved since my last trip 33 years ago. However, under Covid conditions the tour was too crowded and took far to long. There is much more to see but internal travel was just to slow. Staff are excellent."
World class museum and display of Roman Britain baths- it's a must!,"Stunning from start to finish. Not only are the Roman remains amazing, but so too the Georgian architecture and all the additions since that period. I avoid boring museums and displays like the plague and this was the opposite. I urge you to go at least once. Apart from the Roman bath centre piece which was wonderful, I loved the simple presentation and fantastically well thought out displays of Roman artifacts, and the well made fabric of the walkways, ramps, stairs and viewing areas. i especially loved the projected Romans sitting around the cold pool and going about their business. Also make sure you have a word with the actors playing two local masons, a master and apprentice!Stop wondering if its for you, and just book!"
Safe,"Well organised, felt very safe, lots of places to clean handsActually think I saw more as went round slower"
interesting &  impressive,very interesting with free audio guide.  Good value for money but some queing/ waiting inside due to COVID  restrictions
"Interesting visit, let down by COVID restrictions","Visted on a Saturday afternoon. Whilst it was intestering and informative to visit, we felt that the experience was let down by COVID measures. Each 15 minute ticket sime slot allows 40-50 people per time, which results in lots of queueing throughout the exhibit. We were there for just over an hour, and probably spent 15-20 minutes of that queueing, so it didn't feel like good value for money."
interesting and worth the money,considering we are under COVID restirctions we still felt we could see and look at everything we wanted to with interesting and engaging staff
Brilliant ,"Totally enjoyed our first visit to The Roman Baths. The social distancing measures put in place mean you get to see more I think, less crowded and everyone gets a chance to be at the front.The audio guides were a great feature and easy to use.We spent around 2 hours in total, taking it all in and getting a good look at everything and taking in the history of the Baths.Definitely worth a visit, but make sure you re book in advance as no on the door tickets are available at present."
Disappointed experience,Sadly we didn’t enjoy our visit as much as we had expected. Mainly due to the way they handled the CV process. The queuing was torturous especially if you were behind a family group. People lingering in doorways and officious staff.  Needs passing places and staff to move people on and not hold them back.
The Roman bath visit,"I recommend going to the Roman baths when visiting bath, they have a bar there on certain days of the week."
Coping well with COVID-19!,Visited today. Really set up well under the circumstances. Audio system for commentary on the way around giving great information and detail and Route well laid out to ensure everyone keeps their distance and are safe. Didn’t feel rushed at all. Well done.
When in Rome....,"The Romans were truly a sophisticated and fascinating culture, even beyond our own today. The museum looks unassuming both from the outside and from it's advertising materials. However by using Projection Mapping, Audio Guides and screens this creates a truly modern, informative and inspiring tourist attraction. The Audio Guides bring to life Roman life and the history of the Baths, Projections allow the spaces to transform into what they previously were and bring to life this incredible breed of people. I was completely blown away and fascinated by this, I can't wait to go back. I just wish it could be restored to it's original infrastructure (the roof)"
Immersive and great value for money,"We pre booked tickets for the Roman baths as you cannot be granted access without doing so. Social distancing was brilliantly executed by staff members and it didn’t bare any negative connotations on our experience whatsoever. The audio guide was engaging and simple to use, but we were most impressed with the value for money. Our initial expectations were blown out of the water by how immersive the museum was. It’s such a beautiful and historic location. An absolute must when visiting Bath."
A must visit.,No point coming to visit Bath if you do not take in the Roman Baths. Absolutely amazing and well worth the admission fee.
Great history,"Well organised on arrival with timed tickets, must be pre-booked. A very interesting tour around the baths with a taped tour commentary. Plenty to see and read, much better and not so busy because of the timed tickets."
Underwhelming ,"For the cost of the entrance and the queuing, we found it very underwhelming. I think if we hadn’t queued we would have got round in 10 mins. I think it should be priced at £10."
A must-see,"A memorable visit. Very well organised and a great flow allowed the queues to move through the museum, you can stop off at the end of the tour for a glass of fizz whilst over looking the baths."
Not covid secure,"The baths are a wonderful bit of history but honestly would not recommend during covid-19. They let in far too many people, I would estimate around 4 times too many. This meant HUGE queues throughout the entire experience, including over 30mins on the rainy upper terrace after entering. Staff tried their best to keep the queues moving but took over 2 hours to get through the baths because of the volume of people. I dread to think how the elderly or disabled would cope with the long waits and hours of standing due to nowhere to sit."
Endless queuing,"Naturally the baths themselves are beautiful. But current Covid restrictions and staff lacking initiative mean it’s so slow to get around, one long queue inching along - you can’t get up any momentum and so it’s difficult to immerse yourself. They say they are limiting numbers but it’s so busy - long boring frustrating queues mostly then when you do see something beautiful you want to ponder at you feel enormous pressure to move on for fear of holding up the queue. It’s so slow moving we walked 0.18km in 1 hour and waited 25 minutes for the bathroom! I’d recommend holding off for now!"
It's obligatory to visit the Baths in Bath!,"Because of the extra necessary arrangements due to the Covid pandemic tickets for the Baths must be bought in advance. And all of the social distancing measures in place work well (when they are adhered to). In fact, it may even me more comfortable now that there isn't the usual jostling for a better view with the other tourists! It's worth a visit, obviously."
Overpriced and overcrowded ,"We paid £25 each for pre-booked ticked which I would say is £15 too much for this type of attraction.  In these strange covid times they state they are limiting numbers and only so many in 15 minute time period are allowed in.   There were so many let in that when our time slot appeared we joined what appeared to be the worlds longest and slowest moving queue.  It was painfully slow.  From the top balcony we could see a dribble of one person allowed out at a time to the main pool below. By the time we got to the main pool they were letting far more out as they must have realised that the queue was just getting longer and longer.On the indoor bits of the queue we obviously had to wear masks but there was no social distancing.  People had been told to leave 2 metre but this did not happen.  Absolutely crammed in like a busy tube train.  Horrendous and terrible in these covid times.  When there were stairs in the queue there was an attendant telling people to keep a distance but no one at all in the main corridor queue.  On our mini tour of England we went to many attractions, bars and restaurants who all took covid far more seriously in actions as well as words.The baths themselves are fine but there’s only so long you want to see them for - not for hours like the slow shuffle made us.The staff were probably the least friendly we’ve encountered.  From the outside queue asking grumpily if we were absolutely sure we were in the right queue to the attendents around the queue inside.  One exception was the lady who scanned our tickets who gave us a warm and friendly reception.I’m sure many people will say they ‘have’ to visit the baths but...go prepared for a long wait."
What an experience!,Having done little research into the baths prior to arrival. We expected to arrive and simply be given entry into the main bath itself. We were blown away when we were given an upwards of 3 hour long tour around the baths and all of its outbuildings. The staff were very helpful and the experience was eye-opening. Remember to book tickets in advance. There were people being turned away when we got there!
Great to see!,I would thoroughly recommend a visit to The Roman Baths! We had a lovely couple of hours there.  Book your tickets online in advance as they sell out quickly.
Was not the best experience,"The staff def need to get the ques moving , not just leave whole groups of people in certain sections it became increasingly boring and frustrating after a while , I think they had far too many people in each 15 minutes group so appears that it ends up like a normal day they just don’t let you move on ,like I said the staff need to actually live people along"
Not the best time to visit,Interesting and very much into covid restrictions.  But if you can leave it for another  year I would.  At the moment you are stuck in a queue with bovines.  Interesting and worth a visit but not the best time.
Stunning and full of history,"Beautiful place. The museum is very interesting and well laid-out. Not cheap, but I'd say it's worth the price if you're interested in history!"
Lovely day out,We had a lovely day at the Roman Baths. We got given a free audio tour which was very interesting and let us know what everything was and facts about the Roman Baths. The staff were all very friendly and it wasn't too crowded so we were able to get through without having to wait for others in front of us. Some areas were closed off due to then being quiet tight spaces but we could still look in!
Wow!,"Have visited the Baths before, but much work has been done to make it all easy to see. COVID-19 has clearly caused changes in procedures. Given the circumstances, I think this has been executed well and all guides were pleasant, and the route easy to follow. However the socially distanced route meant that the pace was governed by those in front of you, and did seem to take a long time. I was glad not to have young grandchildren with me!The displays were well lit and the audio guide informative.We enjoyed it very much"
Blent in beauty,"Reaching by train, we were easily led by google map to roman bath and enjoyed great open air shopping arcades along our walk.It was splendid to look at roman bath with our naked eyes, my little daughter enjoyed it also.The audio guide really leaded us while we were there."
Very well put together for self guiding,The Baths have advanced in scale and scope since I was last here some 15 years ago. Brilliantly well for audio guides with Bill Bryson take giving you an alternative view. I went with an 8 year old and a 12 year old and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Covid 19 rules extremely well policed.
Amazing place. ,"Very COVID safe, with sanitation stations everywhere. Great for kids and adults with a lot of history behind the city. Can get busy during school holidays so try to avoid peak times. Very beautiful."
It costs an arm and a leg to visit the baths !!!,One thing with the Romans...it costs an arm and a leg to visit their baths !!! If your on a budget £63 for a family is pretty heavy and more suited to London. We did it as a one time thing to see and nice to do with the kids.
Excellent,"I'd read the reviews with a lot of people saying it took so long to get around, due to long ques couldn't pass people etc, so It was a bit off putting reading about that.Thankfully we didn't experience this there was a small wait in a couple of places but most the time there were plenty of places to pass and we went around in about 40mins,the only time I would imagine its a problem is if you have the audio and want to listen to everything about each exhibit which we didn't.There's plenty of people working there to help or point you in the right direction and it's v well organised."
Brilliant visit,"Really brillIant location to visit and see inside the Roman baths 1. This is the second time we have visited, this time with the mother-in-law, and it interested the whole family again. In a weird way, the COVID restrictions helped, as its wasn’t as busy or rushed. A must see when visiting Bath!!!"
Stunning,"The Roman Baths are just beautiful. They do an excellent job of showing you what is left (the ruins) but also superimposing what it used to look like. If possible, go when it's not too crowded. I enjoyed the audio tour, and their are lots of interesting small areas to see."
Fantastic visit to the Roman Baths ,Superbly preserved historic site of national importance. Our 10 and 12 year old boys thoroughly enjoyed this day out.
Great morning out,"The staff were incredibly friendly during our visit. It can't be easy managing crowds with social distancing in place, but the staff were incredibly polite when asking other tourists behind us to keep their distance.Very informative tour. A bit of a shame we couldn't listen to all the facts, but this is understandable as they had to keep the people flow to stop a big backlog of people waiting to enter.Really well kept place to visit, steeped in great history. Although I'm an adult, I did enjoy listening to a few of the audios recorded for children, really engaging.A must see when in Bath!"
"Slow queues round the Baths, not enough audio for parts and overpriced at £21 a person ","We had to see the Baths when visiting Bath but it was annoying that the entry price had jumped from £16 a person to £21 a person, midweek. Toilet available on entry. Audio headset given out. The initial part of the visit was very slow moving. Signs are up to tell you which audio to listen to. There is an adult version and a child’s version plus some Bill Bryson audios in some places. Audios were often quite short at the beginning of the tour. The tour improved later with more things to look at, boards to read and longer audio recordings. However, the long recordings did mean that sometimes the people in front didn’t move on for ages so you were left queuing and waiting ( without being able to see the appropriate recording number so you could start listening yourself). It was, overall, an interesting trip. A couple of ladies dressed in old roman costumes ( they took it in turns to sit by the main bath - one was a beautiful, friendly girl with an amazing hairstyle, which probably was a wig). Our visit was about 2 hours. We did read nearly all the boards but the queueing in various sections slowed us down. It did appear that younger children found it too slow and not stimulating enough. Gift shop on exit although it was quite pricey. As I said, I felt we had to see the Roman Baths but £42 for the 2 of us was quite expensive. I would have liked the audio to have had more optional recordings to listen to, talking more about Bath and Roman culture etc which would have been especially welcomed during the slow queues. A lift was available for wheelchair users."
Knowledgable & Romantic ,"Went on 7pm tour after afternoon tea in Pump rooms.Was a really interesting tour, very informative with the hand held self controlled audio guide.Did the tour in just over an hour then sat at the baths and had a lovely glass of champagne each, surprised that it was so chilled and quite romantic.Would recommend the 7pm tour.Good staff, absolutely worth a visit."
Site seeing,Spent the day sightseeing Bath.Really enjoyed the tour of the Roman Baths. Covid-19 information was published around the venue.Provided with a recorder that gave a commentary as we walked round putting in area number which then commented on that period in history.
"Consider waiting until current measures are relaxed, otherwise expect very long queue","Well worth a visit but completely agree with another review - if you can wait until current measures are eased then would suggest you do so.  The whole experience took around 2 hours, the majority of which was spent in a long long queue of people, waiting for the party in front of you to move to the next 'spot' on the floor.Completely understand the reasons for the queue, however it did dent our enjoyment."
Great tour!,"Really enjoyable afternoon spent at the baths, even during Covid. Would definitely recommend using the handsets and listening to Bill Bryson's running commentary. One thing to note - due to Covid it can be quite stop-start, but this means that you have the time to listen to most of the commentary. Please note - you can't swim there (there are other thermal baths). I stupidly took my togs but then realised my mistake!"
Great experience,"Fascinating history and a brilliantly designed museum, giving you brief glimpses of the actual baths throughout the walkthrough to build excitement and then revealing them fully at the end for you to explore. Also very Covid-compliant, we felt very safe."
Well worth a visit ,"My husband and I booked the baths and thought we’d be there maybe an hour. Ended up spending over 2! Great attraction, so much more to it that you’d think. It’s beautifully clean and well presented and I must say well organised through these strange times. A must see when in Bath"
"A must see, but frustrating in covid times","You must 100% pay this attraction a visit, however if you can wait til covid eases then I recommend you do so. After you first see the terrace you have to stand in a very very slow moving long line in order to enter the museum section. Throughout the museum you are forced to wait at every step of the way which can be very frustrating if the group in front of you are very slow, and this dampened the experience. Nevertheless, I'm very glad I went as it's my first and last time in Bath."
consent Queuing made for a terrible visit,From the minute you arrived you just queued the whole way round. The queuing made it boring and   I hated every minute of it. Some of the staff were completely over The top with social distancing rules and made you feel like a child. Having to wear masks inside made it hot and unbearable as you were just stood waiting around. We have had amazing time in Bath but this was definitely the worst experience of our holiday.
Great visit,Best place to visit during Bath stay. Slightly strange during Covid times but only down side was either waiting for those in front to move on or feeling rushed as people waiting behind. Clear markers all the way round to adhere to social distancing which was stuck to most of the time. Spent 2.5 hours here and well worth the money and time.  Audio guide was useful but I found myself half listening to it and half reading information boards and not really digesting either. Better to use the time waiting to listen to the audio then focusing on the displays. Staff friendly and welcoming. Would recommend.
Far too many people booked - queues made the whole experience disappointing,"This attraction was the main thing I wanted to visit in Bath and I was left simply disappointed.  The organisation of admission times was excellent - you joined a queue with the time slots clearly indicated but from thereon in, I hated the whole thing.  There were far too many people booked in and there were huge bottlenecks throughout.  I spent far too much time stood for long periods simply waiting to go to the next section.  Children were clearly bored to tears, parents were trying to keep bored children in line.  Sadly, the most disappointing part of my holiday to Bath."
Baths at dusk!,"Have been wanting to visit the baths for some time. Booking was easily done online and all the info was readily available. We had ran late for our original booking time due to travel plans gone wrong and they were kindly able to move our booking to a 7pm slot. It was a great time for lighting and to get good pictures of the main bath.They provided audio guides as part of the £21 booking fee which was a nice touch. The tour itself was interesting, quite a bit of history for context was provided.The main bath was stunning. It has a bar and people were able to buy flutes of Champagne and relax around this area (obviously with strict COVID measures in place). The staff was friendly and welcoming. Definitely worth a visit if in Bath."
A must visit attraction when in Bath,"Lovely couple of hours, informative displays and audio handsets mean you don’t miss any of the history."
Enlightening.,"Well worth a visit, and that comes from someone who does not like history. Staff were excellent and very helpful. Sadly I was not allowed to get in the baths but I did ask. it looked so inviting."
Fab visit with the family to the The Roman Baths,"So informative, absolutely fascinating. Do not visit Bath without going here you will love it.  You learn so much and it is not a rushed visit well worth the money."
Have to see when in bath,"We have a one night stop in bath. We pre booked this a month ago. We were booked in for 10.30, I would suggest booking the first time slot of the day. The baths was good and you get an audio guide to go round. Ut is very safe and staff are around the building to make sure you are keeping your distance, however it is just one big queue around the whole museum so I would suggest an early slot if you struggle to stand."
Very very slow queue,Probably one of the worst experiences of an attraction.  From start to finish was one long queue trudging along and stopping for up to ten minutes at a time. Add to that wearing face masks insideong corridors I found it hard to breathe.  Was even worse for families with kids. Completely ruined the experience. In fact it was so boring im writing this whilst trudging along.  They simply haven't got it right for covid. Also they dont let you sit down and rest so not suitable for those who have problems walking or cant stand for long periods.
Worth a visit!,Couldn’t not see the Roman Baths when were there! Very well organised with COVID measures although it does mean it takes a lot longer than normal to see the entire museum!Would suggest taking a bottle of water and maybe book at quieter times for anyone who struggles to stand in queues.
Excellent visit,Amazing place. Was well organised and the route worked well. Audio guides superb- allowed you to listen to as much as you liked. Definitely a must visit.
Really excellent museum,"Really enjoyable, well thought out museum. Just the right length and ticket price includes an excellent audio guide."
Omg the queueing! ,"Firstly I just wanted to say we love the baths and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We did have a nice time but I had lost the will to love by the end. We are the type of people who bypass any type of guided tour or handset, we like to go in, see the stuff and get out. But no, we spent the entire time, with a 5yr old in tow, waiting behind everyone who had a handset and was stood there in front of a stone or piece of coin listening to the relevant section. We did ask to scoot around a family so we could get past and then bam, straight into another queue so someone could stare at a fountain for 10 mins. I get social distancing, I get there are people who want to have the full experience but for those who just want to go around, see the sights and get on with their day this is not for you right now. I thought staggered entry times would solve this problem but unfortunately not"
Informative and well presented ,"A pre booked tour that was easily organised online and straightforward on arrival.The baths have been superbly preserved and well presented, with the audioguude (included in the price) providing really useful stories and information.Despite the challenge of the CV19 restrictions, procedures were put in place to maintain safety and a good experience (although at times there was some waiting).As a point for improvement, perhaps some of the presented material could be more interactive/varied in nature (although, again, CV19 restrictions did limit this)."
Really good ,Would of liked to have had a dip. Excellent Audio and nice and clean considering covid I’m very happy
Not to be missed,Good value. Felt safe re virus precautions. Got the audio machine at the start which made it more interesting with clear audio.
Well organised - well worth a visit,"This was the ""must see"" attraction when visiting Bath for the first time and it was very good. We booked online and then requested a change to the date which was dealt with promptly - the  museum has organised itself well for its recent reopening, easy check in, social distancing etc Entrance i limited, there are a few pinch points where you need to wait but thats  the ""new normal"" otherwise well worth a visit and a real insight into 2000 years of history."
A worthwhile experience,"It was a very cold day and many events had been cancelled so there was a queue. But it was nice and warm inside and it was well worth a visit, it was a very enjoyable experience.  An amazing amount of work has been done on the baths admirable. It was February 2019."
Well worth a visit. ,"Really interesting couple of hours, I’m so glad we decided to visit. The telephone type talking guides are a great idea and really explain the buildings and history. Would definitely recommend. 5*"
Excellent attraction. Covid compliant.,This is such a great attraction to visit.  It was really interesting to all three generations of our family.  In some ways it was nicer with the current restrictions as you could spend plenty of time enjoying the displays and reading the information but at times it was very slow going.  The queue for the toilets was really long as it was restricted to one family at a time.  We have been to many attractions in the last two weeks and this was the first time the toilets have been so restricted.  There was loads of sanitizer and lots of staff supervising the social distancing.  A very safe place to visit.
Wonderful piece of history,"I have always wanted to visit the Roman Baths so we decided to book it during our mini staycation. I was a bit apprehensive due to Covid but I needn’t have worried. Numerous measures had been imposed to protect visitors. There was a one way system in place with lots of hand sanitizer available. In fact, I think it made the experience better because it gave you time to actually listen to the audio guide and take in the history of the Baths. Even the kids (ages 8 and 14) really enjoyed the experience. We spent a couple of hours here. Absolutely worth a visit!"
A must-see,"We were amazed at how well preserved the location still is and it is definitely a must-see while in Bath.Some facilities are closed due to COVID-19, but it's not such a big inconvenience as the main attraction is represented by the building itself."
Great family attraction ,We loved the baths and learned an amazing amount - would love to be able to go in the bath. A great family attraction 🤣💛
Must do when in Bath,"Very informative. There are two different types of audio guides, one for adults and one for kids with different characters to keep them interested. The historical features have been well maintained. Guides on hand should you wish to ask questions or know more. Beautiful site amazing to see it so well preserved"
Claustrophobic experience,We went to the baths and was disappointed that there were too many people allowed in on the allocated time .We were in a queue from start to finish with no way out which was claustrophobic.We wanted to see the baths only but had to see all the artefacts as we were classed as queue jumpers .A very stressful experience which could be alleviated by having less people
Interesting.,Very informative visit to the Roman baths.They give you a very informative recording of different.aspects of the history of the building and how it was in the past.The layout is well done to take care of the covid problems and the staff are excellent at ensuring the social distancing.
COVID-Secure,"Re-visited post-lockdown using my Bath residents card, very secure and just as interesting as ever. Brilliant asset to the city."
A must do whilst in Bath,"I am a big history fan and have been lucky enough to see the sites of Rome a few years ago which were amazing. The visit to the Roman Baths here was really enjoyable and much better, and bigger, than I expected. The audio guides were detailed and informative and I feel like I learnt a lot from them. The fact that they were included with the ticket price was also good as some places do charge extra. It was wonderful to walk around the baths and imagine all the people from that period being there, splashing about and going about their business. It was fairly busy when we were there but it never felt rushed. Due to Covid-19 there were a few mins wait at some parts but nothing that ruined the experience. Staff were friendly and plentiful. There are some really good photo opportunities at certain points and I really enjoyed seeing and learning about all the smaller behind the scenes places like the swimming pool, sauna and temples etc and it was nice to see images and mock ups of how it would have looked. A really impressive ‘wow’ point for me was seeing the coin collection of the years going back to BC. Amazing. It’s a shame the roof has gone as it would have been impressive! It did rain a little when we were walking round so I would recommend taking a brolly but thankfully it was still a fairly warm day. Overall a great experience and one I’d highly recommend."
A lovely and interesting day out.,"I loved how organised it was with the new social distancing rules and 1 was system. We could was at our leisurely pace, whilst listening to commentary on a handheld device. We also opted for the Prosecco package which just topped off our experience. It was a lovely day."
Excellent,A really informative tour with lots to see. The audio guides were easy to use and follow. The only downside on a hot day was that you could not jump into the pool like a Roman. Also - even as a gimmick...it would have been nice to have an audio guide in Latin for the full on Roman experience.
"Second visit, equally enjoyable ","Found the Bill Bryson commentary good, kids enjoyed it. Staff helpful and worth the two hours we spent there."
Great,"Wasn’t sure what to expect but wasn’t disappointed. Found it really interesting, the audio information was great."
A fantastic and safe experience,"What a contrast to the visit to Wookey Hole the day before! (See my posted review)We had booked a slot for 11:15 -11:30 and arrived to see a short queue outside for our time slot. No one who had a ticket outside that time slot could enter, nor people who didn't have tickets booked.We were let in and inside told of the rules brought in for Covid. Feet stickers were on the floor to make it easier to observe the 2m rule, hand sanitizer was everywhere, masks needed to be worn inside and guides were there to ensure distancing was followed in tricky areas. I saw a man cleaning all the hand rails very thoroughly too. Because of the clear guidelines, we relaxed and had a really great time as a family. Although there was some waiting to ensure social distancing, it also meant you weren't rushed through and had time to listen to the audio and see all the exhibits. A fantastic example of how to open a very popular attraction safetly, while keeping the customer experience at the forefront. A huge well done to the management and staff!"
Must-see if you are visiting Bath,"When you make the booking, its in 15 minute times EG: 13:30-13:45, which I thought meant that you could tour the entire Baths within 15 minutes... how wrong I was! The whole tour took us around 90 minutes, but we could of spent much longer exploring. The time slot was merely just a time which we could of arrived by - presumably to avoid crowds whilst queueing. There is a one-way system that is strictly adhered to and enforced by staff around the building and there are also little hand-held  devices that give you History as you go-around.Its a must-see if you're in Bath!"
Valuable history (and safe!),"I visited over the weekend and the staff were very careful to get guests to socially distance. much appreciated. masks were required in the indoor sections in the bath and audio guides were sanitized between uses. Due to these precautions, it was a little slow moving inside but it was ok if you used the audio guide. I felt comfortable and would not hesitate to visit."
Really Enjoyed,Very good. I thought it was overpriced when I first booked but actually I now think the price is fair. Very interesting with the audio guide and lovely to walk around and let your imagination and the information take you back in time.
Main Attraction Visiting Bath,"We visited Bath for a short weekend trip for my birthday - having never visited Bath before or seeing the Roman Baths, it was a good experience. We bought tickets on the day, as it was not during a busy season, so there was no wait. Enjoyed the day very much and would recommend to anyone visiting Bath!"
Nice place lots of queues,"Due to COVID and the 2m rule there are lots of rules in place to keep people at a safe distance, whilst this is the right thing to do, it really slows down the flow of people through the place. So you seem to be queueing almost from the time you walk in to the time you leave. However it is a must see experience and the baths are quite amazing. Loved it although was happy to finally get out 😁"
BATH,"I always wanted to visit Bath just because of the name and Roman Bath.. It was an absolutely splendid trip. The history, buildings the colour just seem so magical..We also went on the hop on hop off trip,which was absolutely amazing.. Bath is a must see city.. it makes you feel like you are in another country and not England..."
Educational and interesting,"The audio guide was very interactive, found the site to be very interesting.  There were long queue's once we were in the building, assuming this was due to Covid.  Really enjoyed the actor dressed as a Roman, really help bring it all to life."
Can’t visit Bath without visiting the Roman Baths,"If your going to have a break in Bath, you have to see the Roman baths.The only place in England with a natural hot spring .Great short history lesson about Roman times in Bath , really interesting The vist takes about one and a half hours"
Worth the money!,We spent over 2 hours exploring the Roman baths museum. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely get the audio guide!
A must go spot!,"A lovely historical place to visit and re-visit.  A must go spot in Bath!Spent around 2 hours+ to walk around as it was my friend’s visit, she enjoyed the time there as well! Don’t miss the gift shop as there are some lovely stuff to buy such as hand cream / lotion and the tote bags."
Very well organised,"We visited on 3rd of August, it was very well organised and audio aid  was very good, signs were everywhere to advise you. We had plenty time to look around. It was busy but was well managed. Staff was helful."
Great day out,"As you get in when you do go at the top of the Roman baths along that balcony there where no indication to wait in line so you could get on the other side of the building. Some people where jumping the ""Q"" . Staff was very friendly and helpful. I wish we could have spent more time and people not trying to be so impatient ( some of them not everyone, no one said anything but I could see that they where right on my back) I think it's a little bit to expensive a ticket."
Amazing history.. ,"This place is a must when visiting Bath, the whole experience was larger than I anticipated,  and you are guided around with the help of an audio guide which was really interesting, I took my own headphones which plugged in and was nicer than having to put the guide up to you ear. It look us around 1.5hrs to go around in total."
"Fantastic, worth it ","The first place to visit in Bath, all safety precautions and Covid measures were spot on and there was an interesting audio guide. There was social distancing in place for the whole tour but this did not take anything away from the experience and beautiful baths. The whole thing took 2 hours in total if you listen to each audio spot and allow for the extra time for Covid measures."
Social Distancing Measures Spot On,"Fascinating place and the audio tour guide helps you appreciate everything so much more.  Social distancing is managed spot on and if anything helps make it better as there are no huge groups clamouring together, you can enjoy everything at leisure.  The one must see place in Bath"
Great even with Covid measures,Brilliant to see the actual baths and hear the tour on the audioguide. There is so much to see and it is amazing to see all the artefacts.
Really Interesting...,A must if visiting Bath. Really well set out and social distancing was adhered to. I would book ahead it gets very busy!
Well organised and worth it!,"Excellent organisation, great audio guides for adults and kids (the Bill Bryson addition was a little, erm, ad hoc and random at times!). One way system, and plenty of time to take it all in. Really glad we did it and nice to do it when there were relatively fewer tourists, as I've never been willing to join the crowds before."
Highly recommend ,"This was both mine and my partner’s first time here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Due to covid-19 they are running things slightly differently however I found that actually improved my experience, you had enough time to take things in properly and experience it without too many people crowding around the exhibits. There were plenty of staff around who were all very knowledgeable and friendly, couldn’t fault them. I have never experienced anything like the Roman Baths before and would definitely recommend it to others."
"Nice to see, but poorly organised.","The baths were very pretty and the history is well presented all around through plaques. The staff were very friendly but could not enforce the lockdown regulations that the Baths had put in place. There are stickers along the one-way path through the baths that takes you around the museum. Once the party ahead of you moves onto the next sticker, you move onto theirs etc. Whilst this system seems sensible, in reality this essentially creates a very slow moving queue to leave the baths. It took us around 80 min to get from one end to the other by which point we were eager to leave. This system really falls apart when other parties do not follow the rules and are not confronted about this by the staff. The party in front of us (a couple with two children) did not wear masks and did not stick to the sticker system, often spreading out over multiple stickers. The children were touching/swinging off every object in sight and would frequently sit down in the many chairs scattered around the museum, despite the many signs asking people not to do this. Naturally the parents didn't seems to care about this and no staff confronted them. This made me feel unsafe, which is particularly bothersome when trapped behind this family for over an hour."
Relaxed visit,We visited the baths last week on a pre booked ticket. The hand held devices were very informative with explanations of different parts of the baths all through the tour. Covid measures were very well enforced. Staff were at various points stopping people and letting them proceed with safety.  It was very well organised  and because they are restricting numbers too it was a much nicer experience and not a free for all. An enjoyable visit. Thank you
Very interesting,We enjoyed our visit to the baths.Obviously due to restrictions it is a bit different.Good amount of information available.Can be slow in places due to having to wait for people to move.Recommended if you are in the area.
Morning visit,"We had a 10am slot booked for a look around the roman baths. The baths themselves are larger than we were expecting and the information was insightful and plentiful. We would have given 5star but the whole covid precautions take the shine off it. There are ""choke points"" where queues build up and you feel rushed to hurry along. A handful of areas are off limits too."
The Must See When in Bath,"Usual Covid-19 disclaimer. Pre book. We went Wednesday morning and there were no slots left until Friday. 2m strictly enforced. Masks could be taken off in any outdoor area though.Having said all that, it was still a thoroughly enjoyable experience. You are provided with a handset which has pre recorded narratives. There are the normal type, some for children and additional bonus content from Bill Bryson. All are informative and about 90 seconds each. There were some rooms that had been blocked off because of social distancing considerations, but you could still look in and hear the commentary.At the main bath area,  were two reenactors dressed as Roman and Celtic ladies. They invited you to partake of the waters once you had prepared beforehand - spoiler alert - it doesn’t happen!We had time to chat to a couple of the guides dotted around the museum and they were very knowledgeable about the exhibits too.All in all, an excellent visit despite the necessary constraints at the moment. In fact being able to amble around in the absence of massive crowds could be seen as a positive."
August visit,Booked online at £21 pp. 1 hour 15 mins worth the visit. More interestung than you would have thought.
Nice,Very interesting!We was so happy to visit this placeHighly recommend and one day we will back again!
Great self guided tour,They have done a great job adapting to current Covid distancing regulations. The self guided audio works a treat. We all enjoyed our tour of the baths
Must visit when in Bath.,"The ticket did seem quite a lot, but the preservation of the place plus all the information you get it’s great. It was so informative, and even options for children to listen to through the audio guide so really caters for all. Social distancing was well maintained throughout."
Very bad experience,"We have just come back from the Roman Baths and we found the whole experience very disappointing. There is an excessive amount of social distancing inside (about 4 metres between groups) and you have to stand on the stickers which means that the line moves at a glacial pace. We had to wait for about 10 minutes on each sticker regardless of whether there was any exhibit there. After queuing through the museum for 1 hour we still had not made it to the baths, we had just seen some carvings and some old coins.The one-way system also meant that you could not over-take people who were spending ages looking at a piece of rock but had to patiently wait for them to move on so that you could do the same. This all lead to some very irritated customers, one of whom became aggressive that people were standing too close to him. This made a very bad atmosphere for everyone. We ended up asking to be let out of the line early to go home as we were so bored and our legs ached from standing around for over an hour. In addition there is a distinct lack of toilets as the majority are closed and once you enter the one-way system there isnt a chance to go back to the entrance to use the facilities."
A touch of history ,Prebooking essential ( but I think that’s the norm now) The tour was slow paced but again I think this was due to social distancing but it did encourage my 3 teenage children to interact with the audio devices & listen to the stories. The coin collection was our highlight even though it was a small display. Some areas are chained off but didn’t really impact on the visit. Staff were helpful and friendly & it was a welcome 2hour break from the sun. Amazing to think you were walking & touching things that have survived centuries.
A trip back in time.,"Due to the present restrictions this atraction is limiting numbers. This has the advantage of being able to see all the exhibits and take your own time in your soical bubble, to fully take in the atmosphere and look at all the items. There was enough space between groups. The staff enhanced the experiance with thier role play. Booking is essential at present. What a beautiful place, educational, informative and delight ful. We had in our group members with walking issues they did not meet any obstical that cause an issue."
A must do - but overpriced?? ,"As the title says, why would you not visit here if in Bath as it’s what it’s famous for. The pre-booked tickets made for an easy entrance, however once we got to certain points people were still on top on you and you had to wait to see certain things. I have to say the price is a little high for the hour or so we spent there (plus I think there were certain parts you couldn’t view at the moment) Still, a fascinating glimpse in to Roman history in our country!"
COVID secure visit,"We were a little worried about attending the Baths at the weekend, but I have to say the hosting was excellent. The timed entry & one way systems were all very well managed by staff and security. Although a small handful of exhibits are closed due to social distancing, we didn’t miss them. We got the full experience made even more exciting by having free access to the audio tour which was the icing on the cake. We had a great time and much praise should go to the stewards and actors who were stationed around the route- so friendly and supportive. Thank you!"
a nice way to pass an hour if you are in the area,"pre booked tickets meant not too long a wait to go in, very organised entry and guidance. The audio guide is a bit outdated, and not overly informative.Due to the restrictions regarding Covid 19 parts of the tour are missed out which is a huge shame and makes this even less value for money.A welcome break from the heat of the day though"
A ‘must do’ visit to Bath to see actual living history uncovered,"A ‘must do’ visit to Bath to see actual living history uncovered. The beautiful Roman Baths have been excavated and restored to give more than an idea of their former glory. Touching interactive history is a rare thing and this visit enables a walk over the actual cobbled stones, over which, the Romans actually strolled. The tour routes you past the Baths, through underground excavations where you can see the steam rooms and artefacts preserved from a bygone age. The tour makes you understand and appreciate the magnificence of Roman engineering and the human stories of their social and religious connections to the site. An electronic audio guide is provided where you can tap the number of the ‘attraction’ where it’s significance is explained. The tour takes between 1-2 hours but depends on how long you linger! The visit Is a little expensive, but guess this money is used to preserve our heritage for future generations. Book online in advance!!"
Great visit with kids,I have been to the a Roman Baths when I was younger but decided to return with my kids (aged 6 and 5). It was a brilliant visit and the kids loved the audio guides that really helped them understand what everything was. Highly recommended and the staff made everyone feel very safe during the pandemic!
Worth returning to Bath for!,We made a special return trip to Bath to visit and we're glad we did.Excellent measures in place for current climate.One way system allowed for a brilliant visit and ensured we didnt miss anything.We all loved the audio guides and learnt a lot.
Excellent visit,Well spaced out and stunning roman history in the very heart of bath. Note - visiting in the evening for an extra special atmosphere.
Informative and enjoyable ,You can’t go to Bath and not visit the baths. We enjoy historic sights and we’re extremely impressed with the work that has gone into making this a great experience. The audio guide allowed you to move at your own pace and makes the tour more leisurely. Social distancing forced you to slow down which again adds to the enjoyment as you don’t feel rushed. Well worth the time.
Expect a continuous queue,We went earlier this week and arrived for our pre-booked slot. From the start of our visit we queued at the door to get in and when inside we were hurried along through the entrance (even hurrying us in the toilets) into the exhibition. Once we were inside we queued in a continuous line from the beginning and around the top of the baths which was obviously uncovered during a very hot day. There were far too many people to move around freely and you had to remain in your allocated position throughout. We queued for over one hour until we gave up and left halfway through the tour. Far too many people for what could have been an enjoyable experience.
Great visit ,The Baths are well worth a visit. The centre is well laid out and interesting. Booking highly advisable.
Its OK.,"A few back ground noises on the tape recorded guide does not bring the place to life, so 1980's. Neither does a voice over from some chap surmising what may have happened there with no real evidence to back up his thoughts, half Disney, half history.  Excellent attempt at social distancing which probably made the visit more orderly.  A site of significant historic relevance and so worth a visit but do not expect to leave knowing much more than when you arrived.  The ambience in the main area with a glass of cheap prosecco  is very good though."
Very interesting,"Fantastic afternoon out, they are much bigger than we thought and the audio guide bought it to life."
Not worth the money,It’s a world heritage sight but during the covid period there are massive queues. You HAVE to book in advance and then you shuffle along at a snail’s pace while everyone in front listens to their audio guide without a care for all the people after them.  The hot thermal waters that still feed the baths is a wonderful phenomenon but it doesn’t really need the masses of underwhelming piles of stone that you’re forced to meander through as if you were in IKEA.
With Visiting,Great place worth visiting if you like your history. My son is studying roman history and found this a fab place to visit and garnered a lot of information that will help with his studies.
Great visit,"A must visit for Bath, steeped in history. Excellent social distancing and santiser throughout. We were there about 2 hours, lovely atmosphere."
Fascination taste of Roman Bath,This was a visit I had wanted to do for years and was not disappointed. The audio guide was very informative. The Covid-19 restrictions were very well accommodated.
Brilliant! ,"Such a great museum. The hot spring, the history of the Roman baths, all the changes across the centuries. It was just brilliant. The social distancing measures made it a really safe and secure visit too."
Amazing ,Visited later on the day when the torches were lit. (Check webs ite for lighting times).All very well organised and you didn't feel rushed around. You have the chance to buy a drink and sit by the bath. A brilliant place to visit.That had a Roman slave by the bath who was very informative. She was waiting for her mistress who was sacrificing a goat.A great trip.
A must visit attraction,"Definitely worth a visit.  We visited in the evening when everywhere was lit up giving a great atmosphere.  The majority of people were wearing masks and adhering to the social distancing measures.  However, there was a family of 4 behind us who were not wearing masks and kept crowding us which spoilt it a bit.  I think face masks are complusory now so this should be better.  It was very warm in the indoor areas which even made the green, slightly smelly water look inviting."
Informative and interesting but not very accessible,"The Roman Baths were incredible to see and loved learning the history, however for a visually impaired person it wasn’t very accessible due to uneven paths and the lifts were broke meaning I had to go down dark stairs, luckily my partner guided me throughout the time we were there. All in all it is amazing but if your disabled in terms of visually or in a wheelchair it is a bit difficult to get around."
Interesting,"The whole place is extremely interesting. The covid measures are good, with full ppe for staff and letting minimum people into the building at a time. Unfortunately some areas in the building are closed off, I'm guessing as they're too small for 2m distance but what was open was good. I do think the experience was a bit expensive, over £40. However, its good to support the place after lockdown so not too irritated. I would love if they could explain how the roof was actually made and put up there? was it a pully system? Very interesting"
Magical and historical experience.,"Without giving too much away about the actual experience itself, I know that the Roman Baths are a must when visiting bath. The walk around tour experience is phenomenal and it feels like a time capsule when exploring all the routes and places (including the baths themselves) that the Roman's once walked. Much more can be discovered when listening to the voice queues around the tour. Fascinating place."
Roman days !,Whilst spending a few days in Bath we had booked tickets via the internet to have a look around the famous Roman baths and were not dissapointed even though we felt it was a tadge expensive ! (But hopefully a lot if the addmission price gies towards the cost of the continued restoration.
Great visit on a very hot day,We visited the Baths on Tuesday 11th August. It was extremely hot but the tour was very well organised and efficient.Social distancing was respected and there’s sanitizer throughout. Really informative and interesting and the guides were all lovely.
Great visit,"I was actually surprised by how much there is to see here, when i visited i was there for 90 minutes. Very interesting and educational, and social distancing measures are great in fact would assume it would be an improvement to what it would have been like without. There is a one way system and you are constantly reminded to keep 2m apart which most people adhere to (great, no1 breathing down your neck or brushing past you every two minutes). Great visit, friendly staff, amazing place. Must do when in Bath"
Beautiful... but very expensive,"I love history and find these places really interesting...but £20ish to get in per person and then once you are there you get to pay for the audio extra (I think it was £8). I think this should be included in the ticket price. Other than walking around this beautiful piece of history with some information on the wall to tell me about it. I felt disappointed. If I weren’t on a budget, I would have considered it."
Massive,A lot bigger than I remembered it was and the amount of development made to this site to make it better was great. Lots of history to learn. Well handled covid measures. Ironically probably the best time to come here as the limited numbers of people made it really nice. Staff were all great.
you cant visit bath and not see this,"all one way system, staff helpful and knowledgeable about the history. lots of information. audio tour very good. you have to book ahead but loads of time slots. unmissable."
Very good audio tour,Very good Covid procedures in place- however this means that you have to walk around in line with others and as such you enjoy the museum at a standard pace. No opportunity to do the tour  at your own pace.Having said that the free audio tour was very good And informative and staff very helpful.
When in Bath!,"Extremely interesting and informative experience.  Just the right balance between original features and creative displays.   The pre-booking system is very easy and well organised on arrival.  Lots of well trained and helpful staff to keep the flow of visitors moving, applying Covid rules without taking away any of the enjoyment from the visit.  Even during these difficult times you can still spend as much or as little time as you need to take in the information available.  Before I went, I thought the entrance fee seemed a bit high but I would say, when in Bath, it is not to be missed."
Nice time,It's a unique place worth visiting.Can be a bit long for small kids so it's worth to prepare some stories about ancient times to keep them entertained. If you don't know the stories there are a lot of facts written everywhere.
Roman Baths,"I’ve been looking forward to visiting the baths for a long time and finally got to go, very interesting place, great to see the baths with the water running as it would have with bubbles coming up from below, it would benefit from a bit more explanation on the site, maybe because of the current restrictions it’s not as you would ordinarily experience it, however a good visit and definitely worth taking in"
Fantastic visit,Had to book a timed slot for entering the baths which was well organised. The baths have a one way system and there are markers all around the place so that you can maintain social distancing. The audio guide which comes with the visit is very comprehensive and interesting. The queuing around the site really wasn't too bad and we were done within 2 hours. Visiting the baths was definitely a highlight of our trip to Bath.
If in Bath you must visit!,"This was just brilliant. We were given an audio guide (included in ticket price) on entry and although there were queues due to covid measures, this kept us very entertained throughout - Bill Bryson even had a few words to say as you went around. Because of the covid measures it allowed us to see parts of the Roman Baths in more detail, so don't let this deter you if you want to visit! A beautiful part of history, and a must-see in Bath."
Must see ,"This is a must see piece of history, walking through trying to imagine the Romans going about their business is fascinating. The design and engineering shows how incredible the Romans were in these fields too. The audio guides provided as part of the entry fee were very informative also. Our 4 year old son was interested and involved the whole way round. If you are in Bath you have to go to the Roman Baths!"
girls trip,Amazing experience even in the lost difficult times all staff so lovely smiley and helpful couldn’t have asked for more
Long wait to start the tour was disappointing ,"Was really looking forward to this but what letThe experience down was that despite the timed entry slots, where we already waited 15mins, we then had to queue on the terrace for  another 45 minutes, on a shadeless hot afternoon. The total wait of one hour made us weary and took most of the joy out of the afternoon. The tour was very good, and the audio informative. I get its a difficult act to balance the number of people with the desire to generate revenues again, but for us, it just didn’t work. We did overhear a member of staff saying it was particularly busy. Just hope others dont have to queue as long as we did,As I am sure this would otherwise be very good."
fantastic visit,this really is one of the seven wonders of Britainso much Roman and surprisingly local history exists here
Family visit,We had a great time with our 11yo and 6yo.  The audio guides kept them and us informed and entertained.
Worth a visit,"We were very impressed with our visit to the baths, its very well laid out so that as you walk around you get bits of museum split up with views of the bath. The audio guide was helpful and informative and you could pick and choose when you wanted information.We loved the fact there was a small drinks bar and spent a good amount of time relaxing by the baths with a drink which really topped off our visit. Unlike many other tourist attractions  we never felt rushed or bored. There's plenty to see and learn about. Definitely worth it!"
A must see,"A must see if you are visiting Bath! The staff where knowledgeable and helpful. Sadly due to Covid precautions it did become a little tedious as you are not able to overtake anyone so it takes as long as it takes (1 hour and a half), which for the kids was a bit much. This is not a bad reflection on the site or the set up as it was well organised and the guidelines were being adhered to properly. The audio guides were great too (9 year old listened to all of the children’s guide)."
Interesting experience ,"A ‘must see’ when visiting Bath. The attraction was really interesting and the audio guide was informative and just the right length without being boring. There was so much more to see than I had expected so was pleasantly surprised. In regard to Covid, I was surprised that masks were not required to be worn considering a lot of the tour is inside and you are quite close to others. I believe they have reduced capacity but it was still very busy with a lot of people. It is very slow to go around with a few pinch points where you have to queue for some time. It would be better to let less people in at once."
Much more than expected ,"Brilliantly organised with distancing, really wasn’t expecting to see so much detail and find out so much about the history of this beautiful place. Staff were all polite and helpful, gift shop very appealing too!"
Covid visit ,"Ordinarily I think I would rate this as 5 out of 5, but due to all the Covid restrictions it really put a dampener on the day. I have rated it as 4, but honestly could even put it as low as 3/5. The Roman story and finds etc are great and the audio guide was brilliant to inform us of what we were looking at.  Staff were also friendly and willing to answer questions etc.The downside - Queues!!! We had to queue to get in the entrance, queue for the toilet, queue to actually get into the baths and then the queue continues and it is one very slow moving queue all the way around the exhibition. There was no way to over take when actually inside as the queue is constant from entrance to exit. There are also no toilet facilities available once you are in, which is not ideal for those who have issues or small children! Signs also say if you leave to go to the toilet you cannot come back in!!!  The queues really ruined the experience as we moved at snail pace through it all. We loved the history, but feel they need to let a lot less people in whilst Covid is an issue! This number of people in such a small space is just asking for trouble."
Too many people for social distancing ,"Was really looking forward to this visit.  Booking was easy - we chose a slot convenient to us.  When we arrived, rather large queue outside.  We were made to wait in rain.  Nothing provided to shelter us.  Self guided tour was at the pace of the very slowest which made it extremely slow and frustrating.  Be prepared for your visit to be twice as long as you think it might take.  Much better if they allowed fewer people in - it felt very crowded and at times unsafe.  Disappointed."
Well worth a visit!,Fabulous experience. Well the entry fee. Have coped with Arrangement to ‘Allow for self distancing and hygiene.Amazing to think of people using the baths 2000 years ago.
Amazing exhibition and experience ,"Never knew how interesting the visit would be! From the early booking and arrival, the social distancing was organised perfectly. The exhibition itself manages to be engaging and full of amazing information at every stage through the self-select recorded tour-guide phone. There are recorded options for a well written kids version by Michael Rosen, as well as insight from Bill Bryson and the director of the exhibition. So interesting. To top it all you can even by some Prosecco to sup while you sit by the bath! Truly a brilliant experience"
Interesting for all,Went with 2 young children the audio guide for kids is great and kept my 5yr old interested the whole way round. everything was so well set up and loads of staff on hand to ensure social distancing was observed and you knew where to go so impressed with all they've done really don't think they could have done more. Also really refreshing to find a gift shop with nice small things for kids to buy that are also pocket money prices it meant both kids and parents left smiling!
Fabulous experience,"Fab experience. Information is with a handheld headset geared for kids or adults, easy to use by matching up to the numbers at each location. Social distancing respected by most and enforced by the staff. I loved that they were able to show you before and after it brings it to life"
Amazing Exprience!,This attraction was so much bigger than I expected and my partner and I had a great couple of hours walking around the baths and accompanying musuem with audio guide to tell us about what we saw. Would highly recommend this experience!
Very well organised ,Brilliant tour and perfectly organised. Not complicated at all and so well created. Fantastic tour and museum.
Would visit again,"Loved the audio going round, kept the kids entertained as well. Great social distances procedures, it felt really safe"
Excellent post COVID-19 Lockdown experience ,Had read some critical reviews of post lockdown visits but I have to say that we thoroughly enjoyed it and found it very well organised.  Well worth the visit.
Excellent visit but expensive ,"Price almost put us off going, £55 for 2 adults and one child is an expensive trip. We did however thoroughly enjoy our visit, it was a very informative interesting place with informative commentary on the hand held audio device. Fascinating history, and apart from a small wait from the outside gallery we didn’t have an issue with queues as anticipated. Our 13 year old really enjoyed the visit too. If you’re nervous about social distancing I would probably avoid visiting at the moment as although all the measures are in place some people don’t follow although this could be said anywhere! Our trip took around an hour and a half."
Fantastic,The baths is a must must must. Yes we had to wait a little to move into some areas but it was really worthwhile. It is unbelievable to think that this was all built 2000 years ago. I cannot recomnend this experience enough. The staff were very friendly and we did not feel rushed at any point. Two hours well spent.
Can you find the owl?,"A very well organised experience to the Roman Baths with audio guides I was lucky enough to have a personal tour from a very knowledgeable person called David. 😊You can’t visit Bath without coming here. Beautiful views, very friendly staff And a lovely gift shop!"
