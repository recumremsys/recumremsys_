Very important site but with poor interpretation,This is clearly a very important historic site with a very interesting historic story to tell. I felt however that the interpretation could’ve been a lot better and some of the Rooms were closed due to covid restrictions. The artefacts there are very ancient and amazing but have poor lighting and interpretation.
Very spiritual ,This was my second time. And in 17 years the area has changed vastly. The museum is still really pretty and interesting filled with great history.
"Busy, quick and easy","We were staying across the street from the Muzesi and was one of the places we wanted to see.  As this is a key place for Muslims (so we were told) is it pretty busy.  There is a big square with a Cami (which is also beautiful).  There really isnt much to the Museum but worth the trip.  You go into the actual musuem and see many ancient writing and manuscripts.  As you enter the main part, there are lots of tombs of Rumi's followers.  Were Rumi is actually laid to rest is quite beautiful.  Mosaic tile line the floor to ceiling in bright beautiful colors.  You will see people what looks like in prayer.  There are some of his books, some beautiful Koran's on display and then you are done.  It probably took us 20 minutes.It is a major attraction so you will have vendors and small kids asking for money/food but nothing real aggressive"
Beautiful museum but lack of social distancing (visit by end of August 2020 / weekend),"Free entry museum with deep history of Mevlâna, a Persian sufi mystic or also known as Rumi. Especially after reading Ahmet Umit's novel ""Dervish Gate"" I wished to witness and learn more the history by visiting the museum not less than 1 hour. Unfortunately my visit during one weekend by end of August 2020 was only for very short time. I wasn't able to see the detail, read the information, or even to adore the beautiful ceilings - it was so crowded and no social distancing at all. Although the museum has its marking of 1.5 meters, people just forgot. Maybe to limit the number of visitors could be good idea during the period of global pandemic."
If in Konya must see,"Brilliant museum, nice cafe inside to get cold drinks, best of all ENTRY IS FREE! very tidy and clean inside."
What a man! What a poet!,"We really enjoyed our walk through the museum. I rated it 4/5 because I thought it just didn't do him right.  Poems, art, interaction, would all be helpful.   Rather than celebrating Rumi's life, it left me feeling somber."
Welcoming and educational!,This was an interesting and lovely place to visit.  A soulful combination of spiritual and educational especially for those of us who didn't know much about Sufism.  The rooms with the information and description were clear and well done and managed to hold the interest of our children.  Visiting the main tomb itself was calm and spiritual.Very well worth visiting.
School of the Dervis,"This museum was function as boarding school for people who interested in learning Sufism and aspire to be a Dervis.The museum complex exhibit example of the Dervis student bedroom, study room, and ancient Al Qur'an copy among other things.There were thombs of several key figures in Sufism in the main building. Please be mindful of your clothing when entering the premise. Wearing clothes which is not too reavealing will be your best bet."
Mevlana...,"you should go yo this place for sence, peace , hug to cosmos. Humans have to Stopped wars on the world."
Unusual structure!,"I didn't know much of anything about Mevlana before visiting Konya, and I can't say as I know much more now after visiting, but the mausoleum is a fabulous, unusual building.  Haven't seen such a large, green structure like this elsewhere.  Inside, it was very interesting to see the devotees in almost cult-like manner visiting the mausoleum."
A Beautiful Place,"Must visit attraction in Konya1. If you visit Konya and decided not to visit this mueum, I would strongly advise you not to go to Konya2. Inside, you can learn about the magnificent history of one of the greatest thinkers of Anatolia, Rumi. 3. Remeber to watch the sema dance inside Mevlana Museum, it is definitely worth to watch and it performs on every saturday night."
Fantastic sufi,It was mystic museum very good city and kind place if u visit turkey I really advise to visit this museum
Truly Beautiful,"Definitely a must do in Konya.  We visited on a snowy cold afternoon, which added to its beauty.  So much history here and a wonderful insight into the Sufi. Read up on Rumi and his writings - an incredible man.  I was very moved."
Such a mysterious place,"You have a great chance to visit an old city from Anatolia of 13th century. You will see the letters, original books, some beatiful simulations of old life and very traditional customs and dressings from the family and friends of Mevalana Celaleddin Rumi, a famous writer and philosopher in Anatolia.One will not forget this mysterious place in Konya"
so peacefull,the first time i got into the tomb i couldn't stop crying and it was all because of the amazing atmosphere and the voice of ney playing in the yard. i never forget the feeling
Mausoleum and museum commemorating a great religious master,"This museum (and pilgrimage center) commemorates the teachings of Celaleddin Rumi (later known as Mevlâna = my master).  Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet,  Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic originally from northeast Iran, but his influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions.  Rumi's works are written mostly in Persian, and occasionally in Turkish, Arabic, and Greek; his Masnavi (Mathnawi), composed in Konya, is considered one of the greatest poems of the Persian language. His works are widely read today by Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims.  His teachings inspired the whirling dervishes.  The pilgrimage site is surrounded by a garden; entry is through the Dervişan Kapısı (Gate of the Dervishes). The courtyard has an ablutions fountain in the center, with Rumi's mausoleum to the left and a former whirling dervish lodge to the right (which has been converted into a museum).  At the entrance to the mausoleum, the Ottoman silver door bears the inscription, ""Those who enter here incomplete will come out perfect"".  An outer room contains six sarcophagi belong to religious supporters who followed Rumi from Afghanistan.  The sumptuously-decorated inner room (under the fluted dome) contains the tombs of  Mevlâna (the largest), flanked by his son Sultan Veled and those of other eminent dervishes. They are all covered in beautifully embroidered velvet shrouds;  Mevlâna's and Veled 's bear huge turbans, symbols of spiritual authority.  Mevlâna's tomb dates from Seljuk times. The mosque and semahane (hall where whirling ceremonies were held), were added later by Ottoman sultans (Mehmet the Conqueror was a Mevlevi adherent and Süleyman the Magnificent made charitable donations to the order).  The semahane to the left of the sepulchral chamber contains exhibits such as the original copy of the Mathnawi, Mevlâna's cape and other clothing, a 9th-century gazelle-skin Christian manuscript, a tiny copy of the Koran, and a casket containing strands of Mohammed's beard. The matbah (kitchen) of the lodge is in the southwest corner of the courtyard. It is furnished as it would have been in Mevlâna's day, with mannequins dressed as dervishes.  The cells where the dervishes lived run along the northern and western sides of the courtyard. Inside are a host of ethnographic displays elucidating dervish life.  Beside the museum is the Selimiye Cami, with a fluted dome of turquoise tiles. A visit early on a weekday can avoid some of the crowds visiting later in the day.  The museum is open from 9am to 6pm (closes at 5pm Oct to Apr), with no entry fee; audio guide ₺10).  Visitors to the mausoleum must don shoe coverings (provided free of charge) as a sign of respect."
Divinity can be felt ,"As I stood in front of the great Melvana’s tomb, I prayed. I could feel the divine energy- truly a wonderful feeling. I am grateful to have visited this site."
Ten days travelling to konya,"Lovely short trip to family,mevlana and business.In the life everyone one time visit and  spend few day to here."
Pray for Hz. Mevlana ,"Belief, faith, love, trust without any hesitation or questioning to Allah. Hz. Mevlana was one of the great guide for human-beings and will be remembered even in heaven."
Superb museum,Really very interesting and learnt a lot about the lives of many famous men. Audio guide was extremely helpful.
Beautiful place,Free enter. Both cultural and religious place. A lots of tourists. Museum with a lots of objects :) A beautiful place !
Beautiful and interesting place to visit,This was a beautiful and interesting place to visit. I really enjoyed learning about Mevlana who I learned is a 13th century Muslim saint and Anatolian mystic known for his poems and words of wisdom. There is a solemnity to this site and I very much enjoyed this location. There is a beautiful garden and several buildings to visit showing how the order lived. There is a dress code and women should cover their heads with a scarf.
Mevlâna / Rumi,"Once you are at Konya, it is a must to visit the Mevlana museum to learn how a rose garden became during times a place where mausoleum was built to honour Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi - a 13th century Persian poet, scholar, theologian and a Persian mystic also known as Mevlâna. All the interior of the whole complex is magnificent and very informative, it is full of history. In different halls you can see the musical instruments, a collection of Korans, manuscritps, dervish clothes and many many more items. The most significant is of course the sarcophagus of Mevlâna."
Konya,"The old town, modernized today, is a good city for poets and Sufis, For me, the turquoise dome is just that"
Beautiful!,"This museum is beautifully set out.  The displays are tastefully arranged and English translations are provided.  The collection of ancient Koran’s and Christian manuscripts, so intricately decorated were inspiring. The building itself is extremely attractive - warm stone, leaded domes, contrasting turquoise blue tiles and pretty gardens. We visited on a quiet day in November and consequently could browse at our leisure."
Uplifting for the soul,If you are in Konya you cannot leave without going to the Mevlana Museum which houses the tomb of Jalal Ud Din Rumi. This is hugely popular tourist spot for both muslims and non muslims and well worth the visit. The architecture of the place and where tomb is housed have been beautifully created and kept.This is a top of the list place to visit if you are in Konya to see the resting place of a person whose influence went beyond those who followed the same faith. Entrance is also free.
Very interenting,Great place to visit when in Konya. Lots of lots of information about the origins of the dervishes and the mevlana ramifications of the islam. It is impressive to see the beautiful books all written in Arabic figures. So beautiful
Mevlana culture and history in majestic setting,"The place to visit to understand Mevlana and Sufi teachings. Ladies must wear scarfs and gentlemen trousers, not shorts."
Spiritual,"The Mosque where the tomb of the most famous Mevlevi Dervish “Mevlana Jalaladdin Rumi” is located with some other dervishes. The entrance is also free, and has an easy access."
Mausoleum of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi |  Sufi Lodge turned Museum,"A truly beautiful experience, architecture, nature and objects meet here to give a pleasant experience for visitors. The museum gets quite busy, particularly in front of Rumi's tomb where numerous people stand to pray and take photos. It is worth staying for a half-day here, in order to enjoy all the place has to offer. Entrance is free."
Distinctive museum,Would recommend to see this. It is free to go in. The museum is well laid out and all the displays have English translation. Very informative. We just happened to catch it on a a busy Sunday when it was the Mevlana birthday and so had a lot of followers.
Peaceful,"The Mevlâna Museum, located in Konya, Turkey, is the mausoleum of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, a Persian Sufi mystic also known as Mevlâna."
Wonderful free attraction,"Even though Konya is not a very (non-Turkish) touristic city, we were very pleasantly surprised to find this attraction right in the city center. This museum/mosque/tomb combo is even free to enter and has quite a few very impressive items.It includes Rumi’s tomb, it apparently includes the (/a piece of?) beard of Muhammed, a lot of information about the followers of Mevlana (Rumi) and a lot of information about the life of Rumi himself.For those that don’t know, Rumi was a Persian poet, scholar and theologist, who lived in the 13th century. To this day, many people follow his teachings, as such, we definitely recommend more offline reading about him to understand even more when visiting this museum.Recommended program? Absolutely. Suggested duration: around 2 hours (although it is quite subjective as you can imagine)."
so beautiful,"a very nice spiritual place, and people there are so friendly. i just like to go there again and spend more than just one day. mostly recommended."
Very representative of a inspirational life!,The museum has all the information about Rami’s inspirational life in the audio guide and seeing all of it at Mevlana was valuable.
My First Visit to a Mosque was A Wonderful Experience,"Konya was our second stop after Capadocia during our group tour to Turkey. This Mosque cum Museum gave a wonderful experience, as our Guide (a Germany Born Turkish) explained various places inside the museum. Very peaceful place and well managed one."
A gem to discover ,"My husband and I went to Konya only to see Molavi and Shams-e-Tabriz museum and tomb. Although we couldn’t see Shams’s symbolic tomb due to restoration of the site, but our time in Molavi museum was amazing as we have especial interest in his work and his life. I highly recommend this place if you also have interest in this great man."
Beautiful afternoon,Spend over half day..museum Resting place of maulana rumi. It's a tourist spot as well as having a special place in the hearts of sufi's. Gift shop. Very peaceful. Many shops around the area with gifts to buy.
Mystical and Peaceful Place,"The Museum consist of indoor and outdoor area, gives you a comprehensive overview about the history and life of dervishes and Rumi, the great poet and pioneer of the Islamic mysticism. Highly recommended."
The best organized place in Konya,It was a pleasure to visit this museum and the tomb of Mevlana. Everything is very well organized inside every room with explanations in Turkish and English. The museum shop has maNy cute things and good books you won't find in any other local bookstore and the people working there are very friendly and respectful.
A mystical place but crowded,"This is a magnificent tomb of a revered personality and you can clearly see the respect afforded by the locals. The museum is ok but could do with more info in English. The food shops around the square aren’t great, so avoid them."
Very interesting place to visit.,Go early to avoid the crowds.  Busy but interesting.  You don’t take off your shoes and wear plastic covers instead and there was no need to take a scarf to cover our heads.
Mevlana Muzesi Shrine,"I visited while i was on my business trip over there, i read the history about that pious personality and having abundant of  knowledge. The shrine was the one of masterpiece of all around the world. I felt the peace over there due to calm environment. But the special thank to Mustafa who suggested me to visit this place. For cardio  satisfaction must visit when you have chance."
Crowded but nice,"Was very much looking forward to visiting the museum, but was a little disappointed. Very crowded and very little information in English, was difficult to get an idea of what I was actually looking at. However, it was a beautiful place."
Pilgrimage site,"This museum resembles a mosque from outside, but is preserved as a museum. It is very picturesque on the outside. You don’t have to remove your shoes to enter, but are required to put thin plastic covers over your shoes when you enter the main section of the museum that contains the mausoleums of Celaleddin Rumi, his son, and many other dervishes. This area is highly decorated and very beautiful. The second room contains several ornate Korans and reportedly the beard of Mohammed in a box. Once you leave these rooms, you can remove the plastic covering from your shoes. The rest of the complex is made up of rooms that the Dervish students used and now contain examples of the various stages that a person takes to become a Dervish. Each cell is explained with a placard in Turkish and English, but they were not as interesting as the main building."
Decent museum,"That s one of my favourite museums in Turkey! If you are interested in Rumi and the life of dervishes, perfect place to visit. I think what makes is so beautiful is simplicity it has!"
Wisdom of the religion,"You should go and feel the mystical atmossphere there. And of course, before you go there you must read the info about the ""Mevlana"""
Odd feelings ,Unlike many tombs in Turkey the resting place of Rumi has the flute played during the day which is annoying. Best times to go is either early morning or before it closes. The place can get crowded and with selfie maniacs the aura of the place can be a let down.
A spiritual journey ,I am nothingYou are nothingThere is nothingThere is only loveDon’t waist your life withNothinThere is only loveRumi
And it's free!,Such a wonderful experience to visit not only Rumi's tomb but also the exhibits and reconstructions surrounding it.  I was amazed that there was no charge.  Please show the respect of dressing appropriately.  I was embarrassed at how some of the tourists were dressed.
"Beautiful, mystical place","Loaded with history, tradition, education, learnings, legend and philosophy. It helps understand why the whirling dervishes whirl. We had the precious help of Nazif nazifdemirci@yahoo.com who accompanied us through 3 mosques and explained absolutely everything to us. Nazif is knowledgeable, has a storyteller's gift and, also, owns an interesting nomad carpet store. Look for Nazif if you want to enjoy Konya. You won't regret it."
soulful ,excellent place to learn about some of the history of Islam and Sufism. The devotion of dervishes and sufis to spread islam. Mouvlana tomb is so peaceful and speaks volume in silence.
The history of Sufi,Mevlana Museum. You may do Shalat here.This place has a small cafe. You can sit there. Near the exit door.So many history inside the museum
A must visit in town,Plenty of historical issues in the area. Amazing pieces in the museum plus very peaceful and respective for all people.
Very Spiritual and Peaceful,This is a must see if you are  in Konya. The place is very easy to find as everyone knows where it is. Ask for Mevlana Rumi Museum
MEVLANA RUMI MUSEUM AND TOMB,"Mevlana Museum, incredible, social complex is located on Konya. It is famous for Mevlana Mausoleum belonging to well known great dervish, poet and pioneer of the Islamic mysticism, Mevlana Jelaleddin Rumi. Also, this magnificent structure includes many sections such as outdoors, Dervish Cells, Kitchen, Yard, Mosque, Library, Chant Room, Water-tank with a fountain, Semahane and Çerag Door. Mevlana Museum set place various parts which grabs the visitors with its mystic and fantastic atmosphere.It s the 2nd most visited place in Turkey."
Great Iranian- Turkish Poet,"this is the place for the ones who believe mevlana teachings and poems .. really spiritual , very peacefull"
"A free museum, the Mevlana's tomb","This museum is a ""must see"" in Konya and attracts a lot of visitors, mainly Turkish but also from all corners of the world. It is very crowded and somewhat claustrophobic."
AR,Loved loved the museum! Although very busy - there was beautiful music playing and amazing energy!We were fortunate to be there on Thursday and watched the dervishes do their magic
Beautiful ,"Beautiful mausoleum/museum surrounded by a small park is a place to find pieces of history, art and tradition. Entrance is free of charge."
Great  place  I relly love it ,Amazing place. They are so fantastic and very disciplined. Everybody are dancing gracefully.   They do the show every Saturday night and it’s free
Lots of things related to religion,"Unless you are keen to know about the local religion, otherwise give the place a miss. The tombs of previous religious leaders are also found here with lots of Arabic inscriptions. Personally speaking, I am not keen but as I am travelling on a group tour, I just simply follow the group."
Good to be there,I am glad to have visited this museum. It is about Mevlana and his style of life at his time. It is free enterence and there is a feeling for everyone to share. Must seen!
Take your time...,"To read the written explanations , or better  rent headphones. The history of Mevlana is very important. Well explained and displayed."
Crowded but worth a stop,"When in Turkey and on your way to Konya, it is worthwhile to stop at the mosque dedicated to the history of the Dervishes.  Beautiful interior and seems to be a pilgrimage place of sorts for Sufi.  Interesting!"
Very Nice Set of Buildings,"A Museum housed in a very nice set of buildings dedicated to the history of the Mewlewiyya Order of Dervishes.I thought the Whirling Dervishes were just a traditional dance, but found out that it was a culture."
Stunning,The tomb of Rumi for me was a place not to be missed. My reason for visiting Konya and worth every moment. Amazing workmanship and stunningly beautiful.
Mevlana Mosque and Museum,You feel your heart with joy and you thank to life. Visiting Mevlana mUseum is the heart of reason for Konya visit
If you are near... must visit :),"If you are beckpecker, or ..  you should know, this is free of charge. Very small, yet vivid way to show some previous life of dervish. Worth to visit!"
"Excellent well laid out museum, the Mevlana Tomb is something special","The whole museum complex (which is free), has been been very thoughtfully laid out. The rooms around the main courtyard give very good information and display of its history.Inside the main museum which houses the Mevlana Tomb is very impressive and the very ancient books on display are captivating.Don't forget to look up to the dome ceiling which is elaborately decorated.In summary, we were so glad we made the journey to visit his special place."
Astonishing museum!,Every one who’s interested in the life of Mawlana Jalaluddine Al-Roumi must visit this place which takes you back into history to see how the life of Sufi’s during this period of history! Highly advisable for people whose interested in soufism!
Late middle age Anatolian religious center ,"At the heart of Konya, Mevlana is calling you see and hear. Mevlana is calling all human beings to love and understanding. Just visit this place and learn the details of his life and philosophy. He established a worlwide valid pholosophy beyond all religions. Discover this center."
A must of traveling west to east,Kings was always part of our itinerary in Turkey. I'm not sure the test of the tourists really understand the significance of Mavlana Rumi in present day Islam. It was a spiritual experience to roam the same court guards and lodgings where Mavlana himself and his students roamed and lived.
Mevlana trip,The life and times of the Sufi are here for us to witness. The hardships they endured to understand the truths of life are mindboggling. The crowd was very patient and engrossed in deep reverence for the holy one. ☮️ is what you expected and got.
the best thing to see in Konya,"Mevlana (a turkisation of mawlana, ""our lord"" in Arabic) was a mystic coming from Afghanistan who settled in Turkey after fleeing the Mongols, in the 13th century.The sanctuary is very nice and varied. Its characteristic part is the turquoise dome over Mevlana's grave. The inside is also very nice, especially in that part, nicely, but not overly, lit and ornamented, a lot of atmosphere in this place.I believe it is one of the best places to see in Turkey."
Unexpected Pleasure,"Included as part of our Gate 1 tour. Great to have a guide to explain and give background. The exhibits really conveyed the belief that all should be welcomed, respected and cared for. What a unique religious approach. Sure turns around the perception of radical Islam."
Heart of Konya!,"When you're in Konya, you have very probably choose this city for visiting Mevlana Muzesi. The place of spirituality and tranquility! What else do you need?"
Very pleasant spiritual atmosphere,Very pleasant spiritual atmosphere. I didn't visit the place during its festival time and visited the place just on my way towards western Turkey. I suppose one must visit the place throughout their religious festival time in Fall which I can imagine how crowded it would be.
Magical Supreme Power Place,"Even one's in a life time everybody should visit this magical supreme power place...When you visit please stay front of Rumi minimum 30 minute and feel and talk with energy with open heart...All this area you can feel Rumi presence very powerfull!!! As I exprience he is conciousness and energy if you open your heart to him, H can get connect with you...If you stay minimum one week there you can exprience he is showing he is love to you... Ofcourse if you"
God and love,A must visit! It is the best place for people looking to trace the cultural and historical lineage of the Sufism. You feel so much spiritualiy and energy at this place. Best experience ever!
A trip to persian literature,"It could have been a great spiritual trip to heart of persian literature and irfan, but instead it more looks like a pilgrimage trip with ten thousand others attending. As a persian literature geek, it seemed to me that almost nobody really knows why this place is really important. And Turkish goverment and ministry of culture, for poloitical reasons does not like to give detailed information about Mevlana (Rumi) and his works."
Kind of Spiritual Trip ,I knew that many people go there to worship Mevlana and to be connected with spiritual things and i saw the same scenes when i visited there. Well this is an idea of people and can be interesting for other visitors.Konya is not a must see but if you are in ankara and have free time it can be a Good option for a day trip from/To Ankara
A spiritual experience,I was at Mevlana Museum on 16 January 2019. It is the best place for feeling real love. If you want to visit turkey don't forget to visit this place.
A spiritual experience.,Our recent trip to Turkey visiting some of the beautiful mosques makes us appreciate more of these spiritual buildings. There is a sense of serenity when you step into the building. There are a great display of the items in the museum to provide us with a better understanding of the religious.
Mevlana ,Great place not to miss. Central location. Close to city center and restaurants and mosques. Prefer to stay at a nearby hotel central location
It is the best  place for feeling real love,"On the top of the entrance door has been written in Persian , which meaning is  that "" This place is the where for gathering the  lovers from all of the world , if anybody has some doubts in this place it will be removed"" It is the main and best spiritual place that I suggested to see in Konya."
Very spiritual place.,"Very spirtual place. Must see if you have some interest in Sufism. Museum is a house of many historical books, things belong to Mevlana. Audio guide is available for 10 lira. However, actual rest place of Mevlana was totally covered with a giant 3d pictured of rest place. I don't know if its temporary or permanent."
Interesting place to visit during your stay in Konya!,"Since Konya is the birthplace to Rumi, the founder of Sufism and the whirling dervish movement, you really must visit his museum in Konya.  Lots of very interesting artifacts and information.  You probably only need 1 or 2 hours to see everything, but it really is worth a visit!"
Historical and beautiful building,"To enter was free of charge, and the exhibits were quite informative in terms of showcasing the Sufis historical information and the way they lived. Beautiful building suitable for photo opportunities which is not to be missed. This is a more spiritual visit rather than just a cultural and historical visit. We enjoyed it very much"
"If you happen to be in Konya, go for it","The museum is interesting but you need to get an audio guide or take part in a guided tour in order to understand more about Rumi and the sufist philosophy. The museum is rather small and the signs are not very detailed. If you are interested in the history though, it is recommended to pay a visit. The tomb was closed at the time we visited which was a pity."
A must see but don’t expect too much ,"The old mosque-turned-museum is nice to walk around in, the old madrasah rooms have mini exhibits old artefacts. The guided tour is a must and you need a passport or ID in order to get one! Otherwise it’s just not informative enough and you end up walking through the thing in five minutes..."
Must be,Havva Meyerovich was a Catholic; French; PhD law;philosophy; knew Persian and She translated all books of Rumi from Persian to French and diverted to Islam; changed her name and in her will she said that I want to be buried in Konya close to Mevlana
Museum dedicated to Rumi,"Interesting museum.Gets very busy with bus tour groups.Not very well signed.For someone not familiar with Rumi, it may be better to get a guide."
For Rumi,"The tomb was under renovation so could not see it. The museum houses the clothing & paraphernalia used by this great Persian philosopher, poet & saint, Rumi. A time well spent, worth a visit."
Mevlana konya,The entrance was free. Not much guidance and not all staff speak English but the audio guide was really helpful. Beautiful place though with alot of history. Definitely a must see if you're in Konya.
Great Museum of Rumi,"This is a great museum about the life of Rumi, containing many artifacts. If you are a fan of Rumi, then it is worth your visit."
Nice gem in the heart of Konya,A very cosy and beautiful indoor/outdoor (religious) museum right in the very heart of Konya. A must do for a tourist! A slow stroll around this museum takes about 20-30 minutes to complete with a lot of very interesting sights. Free entrance! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
"Clean, Well Arranged and  Spritiual","We arrive Konya cvery early and until 9 am we just visit shops around.First of All museum visit is Free and guide is available. Historical part of museum is good.  Clean and practic. When we visit , the tomb of Mevlana-Rumi was under repair so could not see it.  As spirutuality I could not find what I suppose to find.  There May be many reason for this including my psicology ."
A joy to visit,"Very well organized, clean, and the staff are profoundly helpful.  Get there as early as possible, as people arrive ""by the bus load"" and couwds can be an issue as the viewing rooms are small in some areas of the museum"
Calm and serenity,"If you want to become wiser, you should definitely go to Konya, the city of Rumi and Sham! Mevlana Museum is probably the most visited place in Konya, but I guess most of the turists are visiting the city for this museum/church. The place where the dervishes started their existence."
Informative,Visited on a Saturday so very busy. A guide would be helpful but there was a lot in English. A useful and entertaining visit but no Dervishes.
Good introduction to the culture,"We just missed the Dervish display because of the end of the season. However, a very interesting presentation of the Mevlana culture with some exquisitely beautiful items displayed. My favourite was the miniature octagonal Koran for use when travelling. Inexpensive Audio guides available, too."
"Interesting museum, best to view with a guide.","This museum is definitely worth a visit....lots to see, but to get the most out of it.....make sure you view it with a guide.  I was very disappointed as there were no whirling dervishes :("
Busiest Museum in Turkey ,"This museum gets more visitors than Hagia Sophia and I doubt that many of them understand the nature of what is going on in here. Nothing I saw here corresponds to classical Islamic worship. Whirling dervishes, and all their religious practices, are completely baseless in classical Islamic texts. It was almost scary to see the devotion to this ideology."
Great place,Its pretty busy in the afternoons. Should go in the morning and try to absorb everything about Mevlana and his teachings. Great place to be
wonderful,this place was lovely and wonderful but... the tomb's of Mevlana was under construction :( but still it was nice and peaceful and feels good being there and seeing Hazrat Mevlana's stuff . it's a must visiting there if u are in Konya.
An Inspiring Place,Any and everything you needed to know about Rumi and the life of his monk of his order can be found here. It's quite exciting just being in the great man's presence! Please keep in mind that the Whirling Dervish performances are not routinely held here. They are at the Meleva Center.
For Rumi Lovers,If anyone going to Konya should never miss visiting this amazing historical place. Take a train from Istanbul Pendik to Konya . Book 15 days in advance online TCDD. 3 hours train comfy ride from Istanbul. Worth a visit. Dont need a tour guide. All the exhibits are clearly written in English. Free entry daily. There is also a relic of our prophet Muhammad (pbuh) blessed beard on display.
Very spiritual and peaceful!,This is a must see if your in Konya. The place is very easy to find as everyone knows where it is. Ask for Mevlana Rumi Museum. Currently the place is going through some construction work and the tomb place is boarded but nevertheless it’s still worth visiting. It’s what you feel that counts as opposed to what you see. Highly recommended.
peaceful,"Be polite and observe signs when visiting the museum. On the outside, there are beautiful city signs to take photos. You can buy souvenirs of the city at the museum's shop."
Mevlana Lodge,"I went on 2 consecutive days, the first a Saturday afternoon and again Sunday 8.30am. It goes without saying the second visit was more satisfying. No crowds and I could feel the peace of the holy Mevlana's presence. The museum too is a must visit giving a glimpse into the lives of those times, books and clothes and kitchen of the lodge. Rumi's grave itself was under renovation but the other areas are open to the public. Konya is a beautiful town, with a buoyant arasta bazaar and square."
Know Mevlana Upclose,"If you know little or a lot about Mevlana, this is the must place to go. First, this is the place where Mevlana used to be so there goes the biggest reason, second you will find everything about him and the dervish life here. Pay respect to Mevlana at his tomb, look at his belongings, its just so spiritual.  Lots of other artifacts too such as gilded Qurans and miniature art and stuff from the Ottoman times."
A Peaceful Visit,You feel the peace and love in the air once you enter Konya. The museum and all the surrounding places are so serene and calming.So honored to visit this place.
I was honored to visit.,"Great place, must seen in Konya, and at Turkey as a whole. There were many people there, but still it is now crowded. Great spiritual experience, if you are for one."
Pure love,"A place of pure energy and light. The heart goes into peace for those who believe yet the love welcomes those who do not. Whoever you are, wherever you're from, come. Come and find your inner self."
Interesting ,"If you have heard of Rumi and enjoy reading any his poetry, then you must know how talented he was. Here there is the tomb of mevlana rumi and other shrines. Unfortunately, Rumi’s tomb is undergoing restoration, so we were unable to see it, as it was covered by a large plastic sheeting. We could see the the other tombs. Also this place was once a place for men who wanted to become a dervish. It is a museum now. Definitely worth a visit. Such a peaceful and tranquil place."
Heartfelt visit,"The museum is well maintained and extremely clean. The gardens are beautifully maintained and make for a splendid reflection area during the summer. The museum offers a real insight into the lives of the dervishes that resided there and there is a lot to see. The museum also houses the tomb/shrine of Rumi, which attracts a lot of lovers of the Mevlana throughout the year. This is surreal and tranquil environment, perfect for those hoping to gain a deeper connection with themselves."
A must see ,"This place is magical and spreading sound of flute music makes that more mysterious the building was the school of Dervishes and the tomb of great poet  Mevlana is amazing you can see his dress,and his belongings and also music instruments that they used to play and also his wonderful poems in Farsi is replacing on the walls this place brings you an exciting feeling and sense of spirituality which you should only experience that"
Attractive,Very soft attractive and peaceful place to listen yourself. You  might go and let sufism lure your soul purely.
nice,an ancient mosque turned into very nice museum to visit with lots of Islamic literature. a must visit in Konya.
A meditative and sacred place,We stopped at Konya to visit Mevlanas museum and loved it . We parked the car in an underground parking and walked 300 m to the museum. The museum is next to a mosque which also has a lot of history.
Rumi's shrine was closed for maintenance ,It was interesting although I was expecting to see and learn more about Sufism. Unfortunately Rumi's shrine was closed for maintenance but we could see the the other shrines and items exhibited
Peace and calm,This is a tomb of Rumî. He is the dervish of peace. So important character of İslam. This place is als O the symbol of Konya. İ think you should visit there and learning the pholosophy of Mevlana Celalettin Rumî.
First stop on Cappadocia tour,"As we were on a tour to Cappadocia we only had an hour at this beautiful place. Our guide had given us a brochure prior to going in to give us a brief flavour of the history and life of Mevlana.So interesting to learn about the Dervish and see the small rooms they occupied. The mosque was stunning but busy.What a shame we couldnt spend more time here, Konya itself is a big city, modern and very clean."
Awesome spiritual place,Awesome spiritual place. Just keep quiet n pray there its heart wrenching moments. If have faith whatever u wish u will get there. I m sure
Mevlana Rumi spirituality,The spot deserves better. One can feel the spirituality at the first spot. But then gets disappointed when cannot see the real sarcophagos and the shrine. They should take care of the shrine better in terms of accrssibility. The first must see in visiting Konya.
A must for Turkey.. ,"First impressions about Turkey is normally İstanbul and beautiful Bosphorus.. But also there are some gems hidden inside Anatolia.. One and most important one is in the Konya.. Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi..Well arranged and maintained and very central place.. Typical signature is the Green Tomb.. And Külliye..as Mevlana said ""Come (in repentance), come ! Whatever you are, whoever you are come ! Even if you are an unbeliever or a Magian or an idol worshipper, come ! This court of ours is not a court of despair. Even if you have broken your repentance a hundred times, come.."" Come my dear friends..))"
Serene tranquil place,Mevlana museum adjacent to Rumi mausoleum is educative. It highlights initiation process of a dervish who he has to wait to be considered for induction. A lot of scripts are on display. Rumi's mausoleum is a serene tranquil place for meditation though the resting place of Rumi was not in public view.
The legacy of Jalaluddin el-Rumi,"I visited the museum on April 2018 with a Group Tour from Indonesia. The museum is uniquely describes paths from the life of one of the greatest Scolar, Cleric and Poet from Islamic world: Jalaluddin el-Rumi.The main area of Museum display many artefacts dated back to his era, including the beard of Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon Him), the Koran, the tombstone of Rumi as well as his families and his leading students. For moslem, the museum is worth visiting to learn history of Rumi and his legacy. For other believers, this site offers a unique cultural enrichment.Feedbacks to improve this site is the rest rooms availability. Only one restroom is never enough to acommodate visitors from around the globe."
Greetings to Rumi ,"I started my Turkish tour in Cappadocia and on my  list of must see places was the Mevlâna Museum. I was introduced to the writings of Rumi at a young age and wanted to have / make this spiritual connection so I booked a private tour and did the leisurely 3 hour drive.There was no entrance fee required however I was  asked to wear a head scarf which I was glad to do out of respect considering there is a mosque and graves on site. I went from room to room taking a moment to really see what came before - all the many pieces of such rich history. Places of study, prayer and even the kitchen. I strolled through the gardens and finally entered the mosque.I paid my respects and left with a great sense of calm. All in all approx 3 hours visit as the museum was very busy with lots of visitors both local and international but a worthwhile experience."
Great if you like Rumi,Lots of artefacts but not so well signed for English speakers. Atmospheric surroundings and music enhanced the museum
Interesting ,Its really interesting place to visit wish a beautiful garden. Mavlana museum is a great place to pray if u are Muslim.
Nice but too crowded,Nice place and a must visit in Konya however try to omit visiting it on holidays because it is too crowded and all people sniffing the Mohammeds beard - impossible to make photos
MUST VISIT,Entrance is from the side where the trams pass by. After security checks you enter the grounds of the Museum. You can hire ear pieces for the details of the art effects on display. The main tomb of Mevlana was screened off due to restoration works. Lots of interesting items on display including the items belonging to the Mevlana
Worthwhile,"This was a museum to show items from the Mevlana Dervish sect. Konya was the centre of this sect, founded by Celaleddin Rumi, also known as Mevlana. Rumi developed a philosophy of universal love and spiritual union. The whirling Dervishes were seeking this love and union in their whirling. The interior of  Mevlana Rumi Mosque was more ornate than others and had a lot of tombs in it. It was very interesting especially the kitchen, where those who wanted to be Dervishes had to work for 1001 days before being accepted to train as a Dervish."
A must see in Konya,"If you want to visit just one place in Konya, it would be Mevlana museum by sure. Mevlana was the most famous poet in the East and one of the most famous ones in the world. The Mevlana museum is located in the Konya city centre and could be accessible by train, bus, and taxi. The entrance is free but bear in mind that you have to wear appropriate clothes to go inside the main building as it is a religious place."
Must-see in Konya,"Great architecture, and beautiful exterior and interior as well. The compound is not huge, and could be covered in less than an hour or so. Its pretty garden also offers good photo-taking opportunities."
Nowhere like it,"I hadn't looked for photos of the museum which meant I had no idea what to expect. My initial response? Wow, just wow. Great architecture and spiritual theatre. It goes without saying that it's a special place and it holds a very special place in the Muslim world."
Beautiful interior,"The complex here is easy to navigate and has a lot to offer.  The building with the tombs has a very high ceiling with spectacular wall decorations.  The tombs themselves are interesting, each adorned with a dervish hat.  There are illustrated books in cases and some of Rumi’s clothing.  The other building are also worth a visit."
Mevlana Muze ,The place that you must visit in Konya.i think it willl be better if you don't visit it in the weekend + fri. it's busy.  great place ..
Simplicity is key to a blissful life,"We drove from Cappadocia to Konya.  The visit to the Mevlana Museum where you find the tomb of the father of sufism, Maulana Jalaludin Rumi is a must visit.  The place was extremely inspirational and one gets to go back in time where the institute was full of believers.My take home message was that we should encourage simplicity as it’s key to living a blissful life.This I find to be the missing link in our youth today and I was blessed in that my 14year old son visited the museum along with me.Take home message:  We are all spiritually connected to Allah/God and to one another."
Beautiful atmosphere,"Its a must stop for anyone visiting Konya. Very nice place and has been made free. If you are into history this is a nice place. Also for architecture lovers this is a nice place, surrounding souvenir shops are cheap and plenty. Definitely worth seeing. Plus its close to transportation lines"
Must see ,The mosque is very well taken off truly an enchanting experience. If you are a Rumi lover them this is a must.
Remember Mevlana Rumi in Konya,"Mevlana museum is located near from Mevlana Culture Center, only 1.3 km.from outside, this building look like mosque, but from otherside look like topkapi palace. There is a fountain in front of the museum. There are many historical Al-Qur'an, music instrument, whirling dervishes diorama. Rumi' s Cemetery and some sufi cemetery is located inside the museum. The museum is very interesting because all of the rooms with carpet, and turkish ornament in surrounding it."
Interesting and education museum,"If you are in Konya, definitely stop here. If you don't know who Rumi is, you will learn about him and if you do, you will learn more about his history. I enjoyed learning more about Sufi, the dervishes, and how they lived."
Mevlana tomb and museum,کعبه عشاق باشد این مقام هرکه ناقص آمد شد تمامI cannot describe! You must go and experience the atmosphere
Very Special feeling!,"If you do not who is Rumi - congratulations, you have so much pleasure ahead :-) If you know who is Mevlana - you must see this place. If you are Georgian - you definitely have to check this site, cause it looks like Georgian church cause it is made by Gurji Khatun. In word - check this site."
My Visit to Mevlana Museum  ,"Me and my friend visited Mevlana Museum We landed in Istanbul and then drove to Konya . The place is much more then our expectations .This lace describe dervish culture .The art work on walls ,Seljuk graves and beautiful chandlers all together create a mesmerising effects .Manuscripts of Mesnvi is also available in Rumi tomb .The place is wonderful . Courtyard is beautiful . Museum exhibit the articles of Dervish culture . The turquoise dome and underneath the grave of Mevlana located .Place is very neat and clean and very well managed .This is holly place . Blue & white marble fountain is in courtyard .Dervish kitchen shows the lifestyle of dervishes."
Rumi's life,It was a mesmerizing feeling to visit Rumis' tomb and I would definitely recommend to pay a visit while in Konya. I just wish that people would have been more discreet with their noise as well as dress code. I noticed that non Muslims were more respective with their clothing and that made me sad as a local. Might have been there at the wrong time of the day (we went in the afternoon) and it was just too busy. This is a sacred place after all and I got disturbed by the hordes of people huffing around. Otherwise absolutely amazing experience. May he rest in Peace.
Rumi and Sufi ,"I was amazed by Rumi’s works few years ago, and now I finally have chance to visit this sacred place. In Mevlana museum has rich information about the Dervishes, and their life. It’s wonderful to know more details about the Sufi."
Wonderful experience,"We specially traveled to Konya to visit this museum, to see the whirling dervish show, presented every Saturday evening. Better call and confirm if a particular show is cancelled. The show is more than one hour, and absolutely fascinating. Great presentation. It is free. The shops in the museum sell souvenirs at reasonable price."
Rumi's resting place ,"As someone who has grown up with Rumi's poetry, I couldn't wait to visit his Tomb in Konya. It's where he a long with the number of his family and disciples have been buried.  The complex has a small museum which reflects how life was during Rumi's golden days in Konya."
A spiritual experience ,"Its a great opportunity to visit Rumi’s . The artwork on the walls with the Seljuk tombs along with the magnificent chandlers, all together, gives a special charm of ancient times.Highly recommended, plus its free    Tip : never miss the rooms around the shrine. They are like a museum with great info about sufism and their culture"
R,A good and pleasure time in mevlana meusium and I very nice experience.my language is persian and mevlana lyrics is in persian too.Iranian people like mevlana lyrics and his story.
 So so poemetic place,There is nice concepts around this place.... you can know about. Sufi . Their life their learning and their thoughts . This place is unique as same as Mevlana
Very Interesting...,"The Museum was more than I expected as it is also a living quarters, burial site and mosque. Read the history of Mevlana before you go and you will appreciate what you are seeing much more. It was boring for my 5 year old son but ultimately we enjoyed it!"
"Rumi Mevlana , whirling dervish places GREAT","Mystery place; should visit!! It s great place, i have been here every Dec/10/15 ;you can  also graet taste Etliekmek  special Konyas food"
Mevlana,Very nice place. Its easy to go there by tramvai and the station is Mevlana. Its holy and beautiful at day as well as night but it closes at 5 pm.
A Must-See in Konya,"I started the tour in the kitchen where the food the dervish candidates ""cooked"" by public service. They were to complete 18 tasks including cooking, cleaning, ""waking up"" the candles for 1001 days to join. The museum where Rumi's tomb is located is where you can also see the manuscripts of the Mesnevi."
Wonderful place,Yes it is the highlight of your trip: knowing the life and death of Rumi (Mevlana) is a must and you start to learn the basis of Sufism.The place is wonderful: the turquoise dome and the tomb of Rumi underneath and the beautiful “courtyard”. There isn’t much to see in Konya but this is actually worth the stop.
A must visit!,This place should be in your itinerary. A museum and mosque where it displays all belongings and even tomb of Rumi and his students. Impressive to see the beauty of hand crafted Quran and some items. The place is very calm and beautiful
Crash course in Mevlana's life,"We took the kids to this museum and were impressed by everything about it. The exhibits are clearly explained in English and Turkish and are visually appealing for children. The mosque also houses the tomb of Mevlana and many others - we were expecting this. The amazing unexpected treat were a dozen or so illuminated manuscripts - including a 9th century excerpt from the Koran written on gazelle hide in Kufic script and a number of Arabic poet's works, as well as other beautiful Korans.The gardens are attractive and reward the visitor with fantastic photos of the mosque/tomb/museum.It was free on the Monday we visited, but this appears to have been an exception. We don't know why."
Mevlana,This is the Tomb of Mevlana. It is a must to see this tomb and to pray in the mosque near the museum there. This tomb is also a museum and I recoomend every pne to visit this place
On your!,This is well worth a visit.The museum and a mosque  and had some impressive things to see such as the tombs of sultans.Some wonderful Korans on display.
Worth a Visit,"Worth a quick stop.  Doesn't take long to tour and photos are allowed.  Interesting background of the residents tombs.  The outside view was best for me , with the bright bluish tint."
"Nice, Compact Site","This centrally located attraction draws asmany locals as tourists.  It is a compact site and the display rooms around the mosque are interesting but have only one entrance which also serves as the exit. With a lot of people on this Sunday, it was a struggle to get in and out.The exhibits show the Mevlana original texts, musical instruments and clothing of the dervishes and musicians.  The bigger room shows the aspects of the 1001 day training.  Not bad, all very low tech, static mannequin displays.The main mosque, where you have to cover your shoes with a plastic wrapper, is ornate.  The tile work around the main tomb of Mevlana is sumptuous.A small jewelry box contains pieces of Mohamed’s beard.No isssues for mobility challenged persons who can peer through windows to see thr smaller exhibits.Kids would br amused by the life size mannequins.30  to 45 minutes with a good guide book will give you a good appreciation for this site and appreciation for the kind and humble nature of the dervish."
Amazing,You have to come here in order to experience and see the boost of an boost of an amazing energy. It is not something that can be said or described
Green Dome for Mevlana Rumi - The peace-loving religious mystics,"This is a holy place & distinctive sight in Konya, and most of the visitors were Turkish. I had entered through a gate and an impressive garden filled with fountains, red roses, trees, complex lodge and the tombstones for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The complex includes the prayer rooms, a library, manuscripts, the kitchen, the rose gardens, and a blue-and-white marble fountain."
Great touch of history,I visited museum with my Turkish friends. Although they are not some strict followers of Islam I really felt from their stories about the place how much do they respect history presented in Mevlana Museum and what it means to them. Really great place to visit
If you are a Rumi or Sufism fan,"It's the famous place of Konya and is very popular among rumi and Sufism followers, it was crowded when we went on a Saturday and on weekends i guess its free. There is not much detailed information but still a good collection and the tombs, overall a nice place to visit."
This visit did not disappoint,"Before we left the states we read from a volume of poems by Rumi and mystic Muslim and a peace and love guy.  He is still venerated and there were a couple of people in the building who were into a trance.  Many admirers and curious tourists were here to explore this excellent site that looked as much like a western monastery as could be, with a courtyard and monk's cells and work rooms for the manuscript illuminators."
Read about Rumi and Sufism in advance.,Visit Rumi's tomb early to avoid crowds.  Sit and absorb the mellowness of the man and the rational vison of Islam that he proclaimed.
educational,this was a first visit to a place like this. good experience. disappointed that more detailed information on the Devan and Mathnawi of Rumi was not available. it would have been great to have had the proper translation as well as the exegesis of these thousands of couplets available for perusal.
Interesting,I am not muslim but this place Is of interest for any religion or Non religion as Rumi was philosopher of far higher importance for the world.
Peaceful ,Everybody at least once in their life must visit Mevlana Museum then we can understand ourselves soul and purpose in this world 🙏
Peaceful,It is astonishing to be in Rumi's tomb to feel who he was and what he did. Konya city is an interesting city in this perspective and Rumi Museum is in the center. I recommend everyone to have a visit if they are interested in Sufism and also see the special sufi nights.
Konya - Mevlana Museum ,Amazing place it's a must visit neighbourhood the whirlers hats are only available at the small wool factory/shop out side the Museum small hotels are amazing
Interseting Museum,The museum has exhibits in the rooms previously used by the monks. Explanations are in Turkish and English. Scarves are provided to visit the mosque. In order to be respectful dress should be modest e.g. not sleeveless tops and  beach wear. I wore a loose fitting long sleeved top and linen trousers.
The Centre of Spirituality in Konya,"This museum cum mausoleum of Rumi, his family and friends is a memory of a great era gone by but lives in the today.The sound of the ""ney"" instrument accompanies one through out the visit. Many of his writings are displayed, in addition to manuscripts of the Qur'an and other artifacts. The outside area was reserved for the burial of other members and friends of Rumi. It also has many rooms that shows the type of Kitchens and various stages, of the development of seekers, and the vigils, disciplines and learnings that they had to experience. The spiritual ambience is evident and people from all over the world visit this place to get a brief glimpse of Rumi and perhaps even sense of themselves or to simply visit great people of the past.The surrounding areas nearby the museum is also a must visit to experience, especially tasting the cuisine or just a walk about. There are many othe places of interest to visit in this small city. I would like to see a more detailed history of Rumi, his family and friends and their contribution, with perhaps better information on boards and pamphlets, etc. Memorabilia, are available at the one exit where many shops are situated. 4.8/5"
Enjoyable Insight,"The mausoleum, mosque and museum offer an enjoyable insight into the history of the Dervish. As it is an important site in the Islamic faith, it can be crowded, particularly as the museum exhibits are in small rooms around the courtyard. We returned early the following morning to complete our visit. Highly recommended."
Impressed,We enjoyed our time. It feels good to be there and feel the atmosphere. You can also follow an audio tour
Awesome ,Everyone who is interested in mewlana should visit this site!! Very good details from him and the lifestyle of darvishs.
To experience ,It is a beautiful place to understand Mevlana's philosophy and to meditate on it. The side that is dedicated to the Mevlevi school is a real surprise as it shows every step of their life.
Magic,When your in the presence of Mevlana be assured that it'll be magical. Words can not describe the beauty of this place and the inner peacefulness and serenity you get. You'll be astouned by the exterior architecture as well as all that you'll see inside in addition to you standing right infront od Mevlana's tomb that alone would be a dream come true to every Rumi lover. Scarfs should be put by women before entering as a sign of respect and you'll find bags before you enter over your shoes in order for the inside of this sacred place remain clean. There are scarfs for women before entering so dont panic if you went there and forgot to get one. The entry is totaly free of charge. However if you would like to get an audio guide that would be 10 TL only. Try to go early as they are opening the gates because at later times youll have to manage with so many people around you and it can get quite noisy.
amazing experience,"if somebody really wanna learn about Rumi, his life and struggle and in general wants to learn about that culture and lifestyle. amazing place to go."
Feed the Soul,"Whether Mulana Rumi's works line your shelves or you became enchanted after reading 40 rules of love, a visit to the Mosoluem will not disappoint. Walking through the garden, then courtyard, the tomb and lastly little room that line that edge, so come to understand the life of Rumi, his profound contribution to the Sufi theology and Western philosophy. The grandeur and gifts that line his, his father's and son's resting place alludes the respect he commands. The collection of original Masnavis and Qurans, his clothing, rosary are all a treat. An  audio tour is available at the door. It was difficult to comprehend names at times, and often confusing in its Labelling, yet Informative. We visited early August at midday. It's was 35 degrees. Remember to bring water. Admission was free on a weekday."
Excellent ,"It must visit location if traveling in Turkey .The museum is well kept and organized.I would recommend the audio guide or take the tour, very detailed information . Tell you the whole story of Mevlana Rumi .The staff are very friendly and helpful One word of caution ,there are no restroom in the museum ."
"Mevlana; shrine, mosque, tombs and museum.",The site of the Islamic center of central Anatolia. Dating back to the days of the Seljuk Turks. Visiting the Mosque where the early holy men prayed and studied. A good starting point to explore the old part of Konya as well.
Historically museum!,Mevlana museum is one of the must places a traveler should visit! With a great history line and description!
Interesting!,"I personally enjoyed the visit. No entrance fee, only 10 TL for an audio guide (which is useful). Exhibits are varied, some more interesting than others. I would advise you to read a little about Mevlana to get the most out of your visit because it assumes you have some knowledge about the scholars and the practice. It's worth the time if you're ever in Konya."
Sacred place for Muslims,"This place is the tomb of Mevlana who is religious important man for Muslims.if you happen to go Konya, this.place is the first place to see in the city."
beautiful museum but noisy,"since families from all over Turkey come to this important place you can imagine the Disneyesque ambience, nonetheless a great place for 45 minutes of edutainment, exquisite artwork and color schemes"
Fascinated!,If you are interested in Sufism and like to visit religious places Maulana Museum and tomb is a great place. The atmosphere is very exciting and you will feel relaxed.
Worth a visit,The Mevlana Museum is the main reason people come to Konya and it was what made us consider a visit. The complex is attractive but if you're not particularly into Rumi or Sufism then you probably won't enjoy it as much as someone who is. It's free to get in and close to lots of other attractions so you might as well pop in.
Beyond Words!,"Of all the places I visited during my 3 week visit to Turkey, Konya's Mevlana Museum was my favorite.  Of course, anyone who appreciates Rumi's poetry and the philosophy / thinking behind Sufism will be mesmerized by this museum -- well organized and very tastefully displayed.The museum portion offers objects and artifacts that explain basics of the Mevlana sect, but the highlight is visiting inside Rumi's tomb--which also contains significant items in a separate section.  Well maintained, this museum it a beautiful and spiritual experience well worth visiting."
Fantastic ,Beautiful museum. We took the audio guide which was cheap but not very helpful. Added a little to the experience only. Visit with someone who knows the history to really enrich your experience.Not to be missed!!
Rumi,The mazaar of one of the most influential poets. A great insight of sufism and both rumi and shams. Lots of information about their lives and those of their family.Peaceful
Mazar of Moulana Jalaluddin Rumi,Mazar of Moulana Jalauddin Rumi is a must see place in Konya Turkey. A symbolic Mazar of Dr. Allama Iqbal also there at the Moulana Rumi Museum.
Very mystic,I love Mevlana and Sufi ideology. One must visit the place if he or she wants to say he or she has visited Konya.
Worth Visiting,"It is a major destination in Konya, the tomb of Maulana Jalaludin Rumi, a famous Muslim thinker. Quite crowded when visited."
Beautiful,"Entry was free on Wednesday! Loved everything about it, Im obsessed with Rumi! It as amazing to see how their lives were during tht time"
Awesome,Chose your time to avoid crowds so you can enjoy this wonderful location.Plenty of information and detail to support ones understanding.
Beauty and peace in one place,"We were in the transit time for 6 hours waiting for the bus to get us to Goreme when we decided to go to Mevlana museum to kill the time. It was a great decision since we found a very beautiful museum which used to be the place where the famous moslem poet, philosopher Jalaludin Rumi lived. At the same time, it was in the spring so around the museum was surrounded by beautiful tulips in so many colours. The place is crowded with people from many countries. Mostly they admire the philosophical way of think of Rumi and curious to know what kind a way of living he was. Some people also come to see the stone grave of Rumi and pray for him. Even with the crowded people, yet it also feel peaceful. Another great historical place you can find in Turkey. And you'll not regret to spend some times more."
Worth a visit!,"İt's a sacred site, so please be mindful. The now masoleum of the Scholar Mevlana.Well written and clear signage and information both in Turkish and English.Very clean and evident it is well looked after and preserved. İt consists of the tomb, rooms full of historic items and a prayer area.  Sadly the whirling dervishes perform every Saturday, so we missed out."
Full of peace,this  mosque and museum is famous place in konyayou must see here . about 1-2 hoursand you can buy Handicrafts gift from store nearby here
Very moving ,"First of there is no entrance fee! It's foc. It was very moving to learn about the mevlana order, their attire, the musical instruments for sema ceremony. The interior design of the main hall tomb was beautiful."
Ya Hazreti Mevlana,"Visit if you have read Rumi. Free entry, friendly Security guards, amazing fellow-travelers, the mesmerizing, haunting melody of Ney, the reed flute will transport you to another era, in another world. A must do in one's life, a soul-cleansing experience."
One of the best spots in Konya,"After having some information about Rumi it's a must visit museum in Konya. Especially if you watch Seb-i Arus ceremonies in December, visiting the museum is more delightful and relaxing. There are some museum shops around too for small souvenirs."
Very spiritual place,"The tomb is naturally a powerful and spiritual place, where you can pray fateha for the Mevlana and his companions. The surrounding buildings and gardens are great for learning about the Mevlana, Sufi culture and tradition (including life like wax works and poems dotted around to help you appreciate him) or just taking pictures. The main reason for myself and many others to visit Konya.."
Mevlana museum,Beautiful and profound. A must see in Konya. Try to visit it twice or more. So much to see and feel there. Walk around the museum and enjoy the beauty of it all.
Stand for awhile ,Went first thing in morning and the entrance is free. Still large groups of people. Once inside I just leaned against the wall and looked around at all the unique art. Very peaceful and special.
Melvana museum,A very peaceful and informative place to visit .It gives you an insight into the Sufism .Free to enter .A must visit if you are in the area.
MUST VISIT,This is the mausoleum of Moulana Rumi a sufi saint. There are lots of graves in the enclosed area and there is also a museum in the same area. It is classified as a museum and you have to pay an entrance fee.The locals pay their respects from outside the entrance. In the museum you will find all the works of Rumi including some of his household items.
One of Islam's most holy shrines,Very serene and beatiful place. Fantastic miniature Qurans with microscopic calligraphy (according to legend one of the calligraphers became blind after this extraordinary eye-straining feat).
rumi would weep!,"Unfortunately total desecration of a venerable site in the name of religion! Do not expect to see any ""humanism"" here... only releigious shows"
Mesmerised! ,"The Museum is a great insight into Rumi's lifestyle and Sufism... divided into small rooms, every room depicts a story and legend... Must Visit for all Rumi fans!"
Humbling  Experience,"I guess after  reading and using Rumi quotes for many years it was a dream come true to visit the Museum.  I would not call it a Tourist destination so much as a place of pilgrimage. It is a sacred place with the  tomb of Rumi and many interesting artifacts like some of his clothes, caligraphics and quotes from the Quran. The whole museum is very well laid out and very informative. A very touching experience."
Historic Value,This museum contains the greaves of Mevlana Jalaludeen El-Rumi and his colleagues..It also contains his personal collections.. along with other valuable  collections  like Holy Quran and other documents written in old ottoman language and Arabic language..
Beautiful inside and outside,"This museum is dedicated to Mevlana, or Rumi.  The architecture and interior are absolutely beautiful and the feel is sacred and meditative. There are some museum-type items, like the cloak worn by Mevlana, that have a very personal feel to them.  Outside in the courtyard are informational posters explaining the lives of the followers and some of the history.  There are also some buildings with model settings that give you a feel for the life of the dervish who lived there.  This museum and the Sema ceremony, were the reason I came to Konya and I was not disappointed."
Mavlana rumi,Very nice and peaceful place. Like that they kept everything original. Re live history :) another experience.
History lesson,"I really enjoyed going to this museum. I went right when they opened and I was one of a few people there. My disappointment lies in the fact that they advertise having head sets to tell you what everything means but for some reason they were out. It is still worth going, and it is free!"
The peace and love you feel here is priceless ,"My wife and two kids spent two nights in Konya in the 1st week of January 2017. The most distinct feature of the Mevlana Museum is the deep sense of peace and love that you feel. The soft and alluring song of the Turkish ney played in the background helps to create a feeling of other worldness. It tugs at your heart to fulfill the desire to be connected to something greater than yourself. The workmanship is an absolute labour of love. The recreation of the elements of a dervish lodge gives insight into an entirely unique cultural approach to connecting with the divine with Rumi being one of the finest examples of those who connected. Numerous relics, some even belonging to Rumi are on display giving insight into the man himself and his life. Rumi is one of the most widely read authors in the world. A visit to his home would be of interest to his fans and even those just looking for inspiration to pursue their own spiritual journey regardless of culture. If one is not interested in other cultures or has little to no spiritual interests then this may not be the place for you. Our 10 and 15 year old kids even enjoyed the visit especially with all of Konya currently covered with snow. The impressive seljuk architecture of the Mevlana Museum with the Magnificent Ottoman Selimiye Mosque right next door make for a winter wonderland. Every photograph we took from the outside looks like a picture on a postcard.Although it was cold some parts of the prayer mats in the Mevlana Museum were heated allowing us to sit and meditate for a while. This is an absolute must if you want to connect with something of what Rumi hopes we would learn through his teachings. If you like meditation then this is the thing to do. If we are ever in Turkey again this would be the reason for another visit."
A nice peaceful place,"A peaceful, quiet place where people read the Quran at one section; need to keep our voice low to avoid disturbing them."
Super!,Well preserved! Valuables used during Rumi's time are amazing! Caligraphics of the Quran verses crafted with designs and styles are so nice! I was so deeply touched by the music played all over the place!  Definitely a must visit place...
Do not want to leave!,"The place is truly mesmerising. The collection of historic artefacts, old Qurans and etc, they are so beautiful. It would be better to visit on weekdays when it's calm, though."
Sublime,"It's the resting place of the great sufi mystic Mevlana and the museum for mevlevi sect. We went during şeb-i arus, which is a period of celebration of Mevlana's union with God. As a result, it was extremely crowded with people from all over the world. I'd love to go back there when it's more quiet. Despite the crowd, it's an enlightening experience through which one learns about the life dervishes and the master himself and his master Şems. My knowledge on the subject is quite poor, so I recommend people get the audio guide to learn accurate facts about this beautiful mausoleum and the museum."
Awesome place for a spiritual retreat,"It was a privilege to get to know about the mystic part of Islam, founded or guided by Mevlana Jalauddin Rumi. The shrine of Rumi was there, and some other memories and relics. he whole complex has a different vibe and it felt really great."
Great visit; better if you have a guide/ audio guide,You will appreciate the history better with a guide. We went there without any guides and spent roughly about 45 mins.. we could have spent a good one hour if we hired/ rented an audio guide.
Beautiful,"Great collection of materials that help you learn the life of a dervish. Such dedication and elegance. If you are interested in Sufi traditions, or calligraphy even, this is the place for you."
Serenity,"When I go to Mevlana Museum, I feel serenity. The spiritual atmosphere will deeply affect you. It is a must to go in Turkey. Mevlana is the symbol of tolerance."
Sufi Center,A great museum/mosque capturing sufi traditions.  Very well attended site where locals appeared to outnumber tourists by a vast margin.  It is a world heritage site and deservedly so.
Sufi trip,If you are looking to experience Sufism or to practice Sema there is a room in the back of the Masjid which is very spiritual and calm ... I found it weird that Rumis legacy the Sema Hall was turned into A Masjid
Out of this world.,"To understand Mevlana, one has to read and study for a long time, but to be with him you don't need to know anything. 'Just come, whoever or whatever you are' are his famous words. This spiritual leader's monument attracts millions of visitors from a variety of countries and religions every year."
Holly place,It is an holly place but very interesting. You can visit quickly and have the idea. Weekends are very busy but you can easily visit.It is better to have a quide if you want to to learn the the historical aspect.
A spiritual visit ,The tomb of Hazreti Mevlana.Incredible feelings during all the visit.You can pray and you have infos about Mevlana and Mevlevism.Great experience.
Number 1!! Absolutely a must see!!!,"Mevlana Museum is a real highlight! You can't miss it and a reason itself to visit Konya! The exterior is nice and impressive, also during the night when the lights bring a special mystic to the buildings. But the interior and the atmosphere inside...fantastic! The special about it is also that it is both a museum AND a place where people come to pray and worship, it seems to be a very special place of pilgrimage for many people. You see the tomb of Rumi and several smaller tombs for his disciples. Also the decoration around them is nice. You can hear the Sufi music, ney music, inside. It makes the atmosphere very special, very relaxed, mystique and meditative. This is a place to get your heartbeats down. The museum itself is also very nicely organized, very informative. And it was free too:)! A big surprise! Enjoy:)!"
A building of some beauty with pleasant grounds,"I attended on a Tuesday - entry fee payable. We were on a tour stop from Alanya to Cappadocia. It was a hot blue sky day. The ground were lovely, well cared for and clean. The buildings were interesting and I had the opportunity to frame some lovely shots. I did not feel the same spiritual sense that many other stated. It was, still, a lovely mix of ancient architecture and was not overly busy. A pleasant stop."
"seranity, peace all  here","peace , seranity history and culture  i love this city . clean  every  corner another mosque  and  museum."
Something new,Having never heard about the Mevlana religion this was something new to me. First experienced it at the whirling dervishes in Capadocia. The history as depicted in the mosque and adjacent old school and feeding scheme buildings is an experience.
"More than a museum, a holy place","The most visited and historical site in Konya is the Mevlana Museum.The mausoleum of Rumi and also the dervish lodges of the Mevlevi order, (known as the whirling dervishes), are surrounded by well-kept gardens and a central courtyard.There are exhibits of Rumi’s personal effects and other historical artefacts that are over 700 years old.Some of the most interesting memorabilia is the gold engraved Koran and ancient prayer rugs.The outside lodges, or Dervish cells, also contain exhibits in each room that illustrate their daily lives.As with most holy places within Turkey, the usual strict dress code applies.There is a local shop onsite which sell books of Rumi, his practice, the history of the whirling dervishes, (Sema), which are all part of Turkish customs, history, beliefs and culture representing a man’s spiritual journey."
Mevlana,The museum is well organised and contains historical copies of holly quaran. The day we went there entry was free. The garden is beautiful with many roses
No words,"How can you describe the place where words are of not use? Peace, silence and love encapsulate the feeling of remaining in contemplation in this place"
Absolute must-see in Konya,"The museum was very crowded when we went (Sunday morning) but that didn't detract from the pleasure of being in a very special place, both from a spiritual and historical point of view. The exhibits are laid out in a very interesting manner with good explanations of everything. We walked through all the rooms, the tombs and the gardens. Of course, the highlight was the Mevlana's tomb. It is a spectacular display of artistry and spirituality. Despite the large number of people, everyone was very respectful of their surroundings and there was a sense of tranquility and prayer. The experience exceeded my expectations, and I revisited the shrine again in the evening to soak in the atmosphere once again. Definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Konya."
Must visit if you are in Konya ,Better to visit on Friday because it is free then. Not crowded it was when we have been there. The one very important person for Islam religion (founder of dervish movement) has been buried there so lots of foreigners from other Muslim countries especially Iran and Iraq. There are original Quaran books in a museum dated 12-14 centuries.
Too many people,It is supposed to be a peaceful place. It was Sunday 4:00 pm and there were thousands of people. I guess Monday thru Thursday are best days to visit. I think you should be there with opening. Most of the crowd had no idea of Mevlana philosophy. They were just there to pray for ?????
My Mevlana Moment,"Totally fell in love with this place.  So peaceful.  We had the privilege of going to see the Whirling Dervishes after visiting the museum. I was moved to tears , it was so beautiful. The words of Rumi could be felt in the stadium. ♥"
Spiritual Experience,"Highly Recommended!Mevlana Rumi's final abode is a unique spiritual experience for his lovers. As for the place itself, its well maintained, clean and easily accessible. A museum is a part of the shrine highlighting the life inside the dervish lodges."
Peaceful and Tranquil,"I was introduced to Rumi only 6 months prior to my visit to Turkey and I was intrigued by his philosophy.  I really wanted to understand more about the man, the legend. First thing I did after checking in to my room was to leave for Mevlana museum and it was such a surreal experience. A lot of such famous places turn out to be a disappointment, mainly becaue of the expectation build up. However, this place doesn't disappoint. Its one of the most peaceful place I have been to, you find Rumi's personal belongings, his quotes and other nice details. Its very intruiging an interesting. Please don't miss this if you are visiting Turkey."
Love Poetry,A place to visit if you believe in love. Basically a place where the greatest poet was buried. Generally musu rum is crowded on any occasion.
A must pilgrimage in Konya,"Mevlana Rumi's final abode is a unique spiritual experience for his lovers. As for the place itself, its well maintained, clean and easily accessible. A museum is a part of the shrine highlighting the life inside the dervish lodges. Highly Recommended!"
Spiritual visit for Mevlana Rumi,A definite must for everyone whether you spiritual or not . There is a certain kind of peace too profound and sublime to put in to words yet stirs the heart  . The air is scented with sage and rosemary. A most interesting museum and one can view the final resting place of Mevlana Rumi.
Very Special ,A very special place to visit and learn fromAs a Christian I new nothing about this sect beyond the dancing .There is just so much more to know.Take your time and read the information on the panels it is well worth the time invested.The gift shop is way over priced you will easily do better at one of the local markets
must see,"In fact this is a combination of an old mevlana school, a mausoleum and a moskee. Some interesting artefacts"
Come come what ever you did ...,"A place you can feel the love had been realized and the views of that years culture , studying rituals"
"Peaceful, Serene",Fantastic final resting place of this great Sufi Master and poet. Nicely arranged history artefacts in the courtyard of the museum. Washing facilities for those who want to pray in the adjacent mosque. Women advised to dress appropriately and shoe coverings are provided. Sacrophagus of Moulana Room (Rumi) is inspiring and thought provoking. Prayer space is adjacent to graves. Entry is free. Souvenir shop on site and also outside main gates. For lovers of Rumi's poetry a visit to this place is a must
Like a dream,"I head been there many times since 1980, and each times I felt different emotion , If you know the philosophy of Mevlana, museum will be more impressive for the visitors"
Interesting spiritual experience.,"make a special trip to Konya just for the Mevlana museum. on Thursday nights, the whirling dervishes have a show under the stars outside the museum auditorium."
Read about history before visit.,"This is really an amazing place but to really enjoy, need to appreciate the Mevlana history, link to famous Dervishes and way of Turkish life. It was crowded, but with mainly Turkish visitors who seemed almost on a pilgrimage?"
Historical Mevlana,"This is the main reason to come to Konya (although now after being there I would say Sille, the next door village was far better).  The history of Mevlana is amazing and it was fun to see its roots.  There was no entry fee at the time of our visit so that was a plus.  You can go at your own pace as you tour the inside of the Mevlana Museum - on the inside you will see beautiful construction and art as well as Mevlana's casket.  There is a place to pray inside and you can tell this is a very special place to those in Turkey."
Amazing interior but crowded,I was quite amazed by the interior of this place and with all the artifacts on display which were very well preserved plus as per our tour guide the exterior boasts a turquoise dome which represents the sky. We visited in May 2015 actually when the weather was quite warm so I would suggest travelers to wear comfortable clothing since this place is overcrowded with both locals and tourists visiting. Toilets will have long queues especially for women and the floors are usually wet since locals wash their feet inside the toilet so be careful not to slip.
What a place,It is the place to visit while in Konya. I travelled to Konya to visit Mevlana museum and I was not disappointed. The museum was well preserved and very informative. The way the information was presented makes you feel that you have been taken in a time travel back to the time of Mevlana. It is important to say that it is free to visit this museum
"Excellent views of artifacts, multi-lingual displays","Amazing history perserved, with over a dozen, small rooms with selected artifacts on display. Nice sitting area for refreshments, very family friendly"
Beautiful place,The Mevlana Museum is a beautiful place to visit. It is very interesting with all those things. We really enjoyed there.
YOU ARE NEVER ALONE,"For lovers of Rumi, and of travel, the Mevlana Museum in Konya, the former tekke and mausoleum of Rumi, the Sufi mystic is a must. When walking through from the mausoleum to the Semahane pause for a moment and look up at the doorway lintel. There is a kaleidoscope mirror present and this meant that any worshiper or tekkie member who was in the building alone could look up and see 7 to 8 versions of himself reflected. He was never alone in other words."
Spirit of a Poem,"Mevlana very passionate Iranian poet died in mostly known as a religious man in Konya. His tomb is a very nice place, calm, and Spiritual place. be side his tomb there are some of valuable examples of his books and poems which are all about ethic and Soufism. You really would feel his Soul there..."
Special experience to learn about and feel Rumi,The Mevlana museum is a very nice and free experience to learn about the life of mevlevi dervishes and to visit the  moseleom and feel Mevlana. I visited him two times. It was also interesting for my teenage daughter.
Tranquility at it's best,"If you want to explore & learn about ""Sufism"" Mevlana is the right place to be in. Once you enter this sacred complex you can feel the positivity in the air and you feel truly mesmerise by the tranquility. The highlight is the ""Tomb of Rumi"" but other than that you can also see the smallest of Quran and the life of ""Whirling Dervishes"". A visit to this place does give you a detailed insight about Sufism."
Glorious Place,"It is an awesome place and filled with sufis history of Turkey and Persian origin. There is no need to book a tour for that place. Every thing is written and place is easily accessible and bonus point is the people are very friendly (at least whom I met). In summers, dervish whirling dance is performed in museum on Saturdays and in winters the performance is done in near by auditorium. The performance is free.I highly recommend to go there"
Best starting point to understand mystic Islam!,"One felt the glory of Lord in Rumi's presence here. We felt lucky and blessed to pay our visit here in the holy month of Ramadan.Though the compound was full of pilgrims and visitors, there was respectful serenity all around & many people clearly deeply moved.There are things no book can prepare you for, not even a book of Rumi's poems for this place.We left the city but not the place. A part of us is still in communion with the great sage.What an understated place. Best starting point to understand moderate and mystic aspect of Islam!A visit to Turkey is incomplete without visit to Mevlana."
A must even for the non-mystical,"We walked across the already-teeming plaza to the Melvana Museum, which included the tomb of Rumi (mobbed with pilgrims, many from Syria) and the marble tombs of several other Dervish abbots. Elaborately painted dormers and soaring arches decorated the main room. Much smaller side rooms contained assorted artifacts of the Mevelvi, including the lodge’s banner and a tea service. The kitchen/refectory was spacious and especially interesting. Not only did we see the cooking implements and the dining table, but also some of the steps in the 1001 days of training undertaken by Dervish novices, demonstrated by manikins."
"Very interesting, members of the faith were obviously very moved.","The whole place is very special, make sue that you get an electronic tour guide as it will explain everything to you. If you go on a holy day (which we apparently did) then you can get in for free otherwise there is normally an entrance fee. If you are at all interested in the history of Turkey then this place is a must."
History of Whirling Dervishes,"From Pammukale to Cappadocia, enroute Konys to visit the home and museum of the the whirling dervishes. Admission fee applies.The museum prohibits foot wear. To enter the museum, all visitors need to put on a plastic socks provided by them. It showcases the origins and history of this holy people. No photography inside the museum. A small showcase area, it can be packed. Watchful over one's belongings.Also find few souvenir shops and cafes."
Listen to your soul here.  If you have not been here you have not been in Konya.,"This museum has so much to offer for those who can look and see. If you don't see what you are looking at, or just stare around, you would still notice so many details about Rumi philosopy.This is a mystic place and it is very much respected by the local people and also considered a holly place.  Proper dressing is required. Keeping the peaceful environment is also required. It can be very crowded sometimes, but you will not be disturbed.  You would feel welcomed here.  There are many handwritten Qurans and other books, which are priceless.  Some are written with liquid gold.  You will be amazed by the beauty of the handwritings, and handcrafts.  A must to do in Konya."
Soulful Experience~,"The visit to the Mevlana(Rumi) Museum was like living a dream for me ...the Sufi mystic has been a guide for many years and to be in the presence of his tomb and his work so close was an amazing experience. The place is arranged very well. One can rent a recorder for an audio guided tour which is very detailed and informational. Also a map can be found in the entrance that helps one charter the area . I spent a lot of time inside and it was a pleasure watching people from all over the world come and offer respect , One is not disturbed and can remain in the corner for as long as one wants to imbibe the ambiance."
Reflects Rumi's philosophy ,"Was very happy to visit this place, found it true to the spirit of Rumi- all embracing, tolerant & educational & very calming. Women were free to keep their heads uncovered if they wished so & entry is free. Very neat & clean, they had plastic shoe covers so no need to take footwear off. No restrictions on using the camera or where to stand. You can sit inside, read, pray or just pay your respects & linger in the grounds. The mausoleum itself is done up discreetly & reverentially. They have a lot of well preserved artefacts on display. The cells are well maintained, very clearly labelled & extremely informative. The staff are polite. We went back again the next day. Do visit it if you have any interest in Sufism-very educational."
Plenty to see,"The museum is housed in what were residential quarters outside Rumi's tomb. There is a lot to see and the exhibits are well labeled with their history and stories behind them.There aren't any guides, but then we didn't need assistance.This is a nice place to spend a couple of hours. Entry is free."
Museum of Mevlana,"It's the monastery of Mevlana, now the museum Mevlana in Konya; it's a moschee with a green attic (roof) ; if you come inside, it's a basilica with very nice sculptures in the entrance, a holy shrine, silence and a  divine atmosphere, you see first the tomb of Mevlana Rumi, the philosophe and poet; a million pilgrims or tourists visit the nice museum. Wonderful paintings, sculptures, carpets; waxfigures to demonstrate the life in the monastery at this time; Every two years is a festival here on the day of the dead of Mevlana in the year 1273.Outside, around the museum is a wonderful rosegarden with a nice fountain, nice to make pictures. A nice spirituel visit."
Excellent experience,We visited the Mevlana mausoleum & museum during our visit to Konya last month.It was an uplifting visit to be able to pay our respects to such a holy Sufi saint.
Must See,"Mevlana(Rumi) Museum is a must see place in Konya. If you have read about him and his teachings. You know how important teacher and a person he was. Like he once said ""Come whoever you are come"""
Excelent museum,"It is beautiful from the outside, and very interesting to see from the inside. For me it is already alone a good reason to go to Konya. A lot of information. And it was free. Also check out the neighboring district."
Treasury of Holy Quran,Learn about the history of Sufi & the Whirling dance.A great collection of Holy Quran inscription.From the smallest to the biggest.
Really cultural and spiritual,We came here with our OAT tour group. It was fabulous. A very spiritual site for Muslims. Our guide brought the history alive starting with how young boys would come there and prayer for acceptance. The rooms show where and how they lived in a diorama style. The main hall is just beautiful with tombs of the deceased and various artifacts. There are beautiful Koran's and spiritual articles. A special case with artifacts of Mohammad.
Another MUST,"This museum, prior mosque, is not only the heart of Sufism and the Whirling Dervishs, but this is the number one attraction in all of Turkey for Muslims. Given the opportunity, a guide is preferred as there are many small items that are remarkable. The monastery rooms of the initiates are also interesting."
Sufi retreat,"For those in the know, this is the place of spiritual upliftment, retreat and self-evaluation. Excellent facility with standard is museum artefacts and of course the tomb of this great Sufi saint and his followers. Going again next week."
Mevlana Celaleddin'i Rumi,"Hz. Mevlana Celaleddin-i Rumi is the great Anatolian philosopher. He is known as Hz. Mevlana in the East and as Rumi in the West. Mevlana is a Muslim. His doctrine advocates unlimited tolerance, positive reasoning, goodness, charity and awareness through love. To him all religions were more or less truth. Mevlana looked with the same eye on Muslim, Jew and Christian alike. His peaceful and tolerant teachings have appealed to men of all sects and creeds. In 1958, Pope John XXIII wrote a special message saying: “In the name of the Catholic World, I bow with respect before the memory of Rumi.”"
Extraordinary Mystical Place,"I loved every moment of my visit cause I love Molana and have read his Masnavi book and others, A great place to revisit of all your readings and see the tombs of him and his companions, very spiritual and reviving. A true must do experience for all spiritual lovers."
A definite must-see,"This was an incredible experience. This is a popular place to visit, not only for tourists, but for locals as well. It is absolutely a must-see when in Turkey."
Interesting museum,"We had a guided tour of the Mevlana Complex, and the museum. Very crowded place. Hard to move around. Interesting, but confronting.Ladies need scarves."
Görülmesi gereken bir müze,Such a perfect museum. I have visited many museums around the world but this one is amazing. It is free but you can rent earphones for only 10 Lira (aprox. 3 USD) and listen all the details about the museum. Well designed and centered location.It is crowded. You should visit early or in weekdays. Some parts are in open air. It is better to go by sunshine.I loved it.
Peacful location,Very peacful place where you can enjoy the historical memory  of Mevlana  Jalal al-ddein al-Romi .Quit and refreshing.
Impressive Heart of Sufiism,"Not a sufi myself, but still impressed with the serene atmosphere, well-maintained lodgings of Mevlana Rumi's followers, and the variety of historical artifacts on display.  The mausoleum is just 10 minutes' walk from Hilton Garden Inn.  Also make sure to see the museum with very well put-together displays of modern Turkish history (since World War I)."
History & Culture,"its the most famous place in Konya. A must place visit for people looking to trace the cultural & historical lineage of the Sufism.Mevlana Rumi, the famous Sufi saint & world renowned Poet & philosopher rests here.. Go there and sit down in a corner to discover inner calm & peace.."
Love it!,"I love Rumi""s poems,  so visiting his museum was a highlight for me,   worth visiting,  great for picture taking."
Great historical holy shrine,"Most see place in Turkey , peaceful and historical,  arrayed with Persian poem. I like the space  and environment."
"Mevlana Museum - Intereting place to visit, with good photo opporunities.","The one good aspect of this attraction, is that now they permit photography within the buildings.  A couple of years ago, photography was forbidden.In Konya this is one of the main attractions.  Providing a look at a religious sect.Would we recommend this attraction:  Yes, at least once.Would we return to this establishment:  No, as we have been to this attraction at least two times."
Beautiful Museum as beautiful thought He did.,"Early April will brings you to enjoy tulips around this museum. Mevlana Celeleddin Rumi teach previous about love and peace. Suitable everyone no matter what religious they are from, which country, and races. It is a great tomb of him, but the philosophy brings this place for everyone worth visit. Good place for picture too."
Top priority when visiting Konya,"If you are visiting Konya you have to visit here. It is the resting place of Jalal ad-din Rumi. Come here to pay your respects, it is quiet and peaceful with many other people resting. Also there are many beautiful relics in the same building. Not rushed or hassled at all by the guards.  His teacher Shems-e-Tebrazi is 15 minute walk away also."
Must place in Konya to visit,"In Turkish we say that.. Travel the word but see the Konya.. and in Konya see the Mevlana.. Because Mevlana says whomever you are and where ever you are, whatever you are .. come ... come.."
surely must visit place,"a beautiful site with interesting items in museum like mevlana dress, books and private items and so on.must visit in Konya and Turkey"
This museum and Mosque is one of the most interesting places to visit,"One enters through the mosque and continues into a courtyard museum that gives an idea of the life the Sufic followers of Rumi lived. Since this is the heart of Sufic practice, which is called 'Meditation in movement' it has to be seen before one can understand the the Whirling Dervishes which need to be seen to realise the beautiful and pure religious feeling in their movements."
