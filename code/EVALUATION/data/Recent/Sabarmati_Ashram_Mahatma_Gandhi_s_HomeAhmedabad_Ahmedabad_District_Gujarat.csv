A place to visit,"Visited the historical Sabarmati Ashram in January 2020 with some friends during a day trip to Ahmedabad. Obviously, this is one of the must visit place in Ahmedabad but was very disappointed with the level of cleanliness and security. Should be better maintained considering this is the place the greatest icon of India Mahatma Gandhi set up and led the freedom struggle from."
Sabarmati Ashram,"Why is Gandhi relevant even now in the digital age.On his birthday week lets explore some of the places he lived ,so as to inspire us even now...Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, Gujarat is one of the places where Gandhiji lived. The simplicity of living ones life is visible in every nook and corner of the ashram, now converted as a museum"
Boring,"Unless this would be like 'holy ground' for you, the site is quite boring and doesn't really give you an insight in Gandhi's  life."
Quite place at the City,This is the ashram which was established by mahatma Gandhi ji in 1917s at the sabarmati river. Gandhi memorail museum is there and his home still there.

High recommended! ,"Highly moving visit to Gandhi Ashram. Site is well kept, gift shop and WC facilities available. Felt safe and secure throughout."
Quite a sobering Visit,"We visited this site on recommendadtion and we were very pleased to have had the recommendadtion.  A very historic place which tells the story of Mahatma Gandi, it is not a place to hurry around soplenty of time is needed to take in all the story, but well worth the time."
The Nostalgia of Gandhiji's own Sabarmati Ashram,"The Ashram is located on the banks of Sabarmati river , well kept and nostalgic location to anyone who has studied Indian history. The view is excellent. The room used by Gandhiji, Kasturba and the photo museum are worth visiting."
Very natural and positive vibes...,Very right place to spend some time preferably in the evening or morning. Good to know more about Mahatma Gandhi and to sit in silence with yourself. The place is at the bank of Sabarmati river and have a very natural feel where chirping of different birds makes it more lively.
Best Birthday Gift I can give to my Kids,"This is the place I have Choose to Celebrate my kids Birthday last year, we spend whole day at Sabarmati Ashram and evening on Narmada Bridge. Place itself gives u a Patriotic feel and very tidy. Place is maintained very well. taken care of each and every bit and tried to take us to back old days"
Serene abode,"Visiting this ashram is an overwhelming experience in itself. A feeling of serenity envelopes a visitor as he sets foot on the hallowed ground where Gandhiji himself had walked. One feels as if he is re-connecting with a great soul.The Ashram is well-maintained, but the museum can be modernised with audio-visual aids"
Sabarmati Ashram,Sabarmati Ashram located on the banks of Sabarmati river is a must-visit place. Gandhiji lived in this place along with his wife Kasturba for about 12 years. The Ashram being converted into Museum displays historic events of Gandhiji’s life. We can see Gandhiji’s house with some personal belongings and also there is a book store.
Amazing Feeling with Gandhi Ashram at Ahmedabad,"Good Morning Friends,        So many times visiting in Gandhi Ashram at Ahmedabad.Ashram near Sabarmati Riverfront.This place is very popular and famous because Gandhi Bapuji Homes.Ashram available Original items like Photo, Charka,etc.. Location is Amazing and Peace full atmosphere. I think everyone come in place one time.."
Serene and Historical,"Located on the banks of Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad. It is popularly known as Gandhi Ashram. Has its own museum,Vinoba Kutir, named after Acharya Vinoba who stayed here. Visited by many important dignatories around the world it's a worth visit when in Ahmadabad. It reminds the journey of Mahatma Gandhi and some stories of his family.  How Mohan to Mahatma during all those years. Very informative about history of Indian independence and the struggle led by Mahatma."
"Surreal feeling at the mecca of ""peace""","Just couple of days before Donald Trump’s symbolic visit to Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad, I had a wonderful experience attending the ""Lead Like Gandhi"" Fellowship program held at Sabarmati Ashram in early February 2020. On Day 1, the Oscar winning movie ""Gandhi"" was screened at the Ashram for all the Fellowship participants after 8:00pm. What a wonderful feeling to watch the movie while being seated at a place where all the action took place !!The current political narrative may not hold Gandhi in high esteem though few of his teachings are still followed - The ""Swachh Bharat"" mission and ""Make in India"" initiative come to my mind. Gandhi had always said “India lives in the Villages” and if our focus shifted to building the rural economy instead of just urban based economy, well, India could be #1 soon.Besides the wall built to hide the real India (read “hutments”) on the route to be taken by the POTUS (he loves Walls) from Ahmedabad Airport to Sabarmati Ashram, the Trustees of the Ashram were busy making arrangements to welcome the most powerful politician on Earth, whose stay was estimated to be less than 30 minutes. Trump, who called our P.M. the “Father of India” during the event at Houston last year, must be getting some serious lessons on the “Father of our Nation” though he is far from following any of the Gandhian values . If Gandhi was alive today, he would have still addressed him as “My dear Friend Trump”. It was good to see our younger generation visit the Ashram, spending good amount of time taking selfies with Gandhi (statues and images) at “Hriday Kunj” - his abode from 1917 to 1930. The ashram located on the banks of the river Sabarmati was shifted from Kochrab Ashram (also called Satyagraha Ashram) in 1917. It was from here that Gandhi led the Dandi march in 1930. He vowed never to return to the Ashram until India had gained independence and the vow remained unfulfilled till his death.During the Gandhi fellowship program (7th to 15th Feb), I was only hoping our younger generation adopt some of the values the great man stood for and help build a sustainable world!"
Tranquil slice of history!,"We visited the Sabarmati ashram on our own before the city sightseeing tour started at 1.30 pm. So we spent considerable time in getting the vibe of the place. Peaceful, enchanting and serene; the ashram made us sentimental, as we remembered how that place had played such an important role in our freedom struggle. The specters of Mahatma Gandhi and his supportive wife Kasturba Gandhi undoubtedly guided us through their abode, as we silently glimpsed their residential quarters, sparse belongings, the famed charkha, tableau of the Salt Satyagraha, writings, et al with the backdrop of the concrete waterfront and the tranquil Sabarmati river, glistening in the afternoon sun, with unabashed pride.We bowed down before the statue of the Mahatma in a sitting pose; and were filled with immense respect and love for the great leader and apostle of non-violence.As the first place on the sight-seeing itinerary was the ashram that we had already experienced, we chose to relax for half an hour in the bus after a round of delicious cookies purchased from the kiosk across the road, selling ice-cream and baked snacks.By the way, the City tour bus starts its journey from the opposite side of the Sabarmati Ashram entrance, near  this kiosk, adjacent to Toran Hotel."
Must see if you visit Ahmedabad,"The sabarmati Ashram serves as a source of inspiration and guidance to the present generation.It  was home to  Gandhiji from 1917 until 1930 and  served as one of the main centres of the Indian freedom struggle.It is situated on banks of river Sabarmati.The various places you will see here are ,Hridaya Kunj where Gandhiji lived in a small cottage , a place  where  we see some of the things which Gandhiji used like writing desk, a khadi kurta, a yarn spun by him and some of his letters.Nandini,is an old Ashram guest house, where guests from India and abroad are put up,Vinoba Kutir and  Mira Kutir.There is a library and museum and a small shop which sells Khadi products.It is well maintained and one can spend good two to three hours reviving history.There is ample car parking space,and clean toilets.Wheel chair is also available."
Serene and Informative ,A lovely museum lovingly curated and a meaningful way to remember a great and humble man. Walking in his footsteps is inspiring.
Must see ,I would highly recommend a visit to the  ashram.  Great history not only of Mahatma  Gandhi but also of India. Grounds are well kept. Bathrooms are decent.
Peaceful place to sit and relax,"You can find a lot of information from Gandhi ji´s life, the making and importance of this orphanage, why was this turned into a memorial place. I also got to buy a souvenir from here for my memories!"
Inspired My Soul,"This is a wonderful place. No entry fee, you can click photos of anything you like. Place is full of quotes, anecdotes, letters, photos and other belongings of Gandhiji. Ideas are framed in Q&A format. One can see the rooms of Gandhiji, Ba, and Vinoba, kowotow to them and bask in the calm of Sabarmati. There is a book/souvenir shop. If you feel like, make some donation there. This place would inspire your soul."
"Peaceful, moving place.","This place is beautifully balanced between simple ashram, poignant cultural monument and informative museum and education centre. Gandhi's simple living quarters on the riverfront are a highlight, and there is much food for thought in the informative panels summarising his life and work."
Father of Nation's prestigeous place.,"Mahatma Gandhi Father of Nation India's most dedicated freedom fighter stayed in Sabaramati Ashram. This place situated on the bank of Sabaramati river of Ahmadabad. Gandhiji stayed here, he used to make Prayer, Cotten thread from Charaka, bhajan every day. Now National heritage centre. Buildings Renovated , peaceful place , Gandhiji rare photos, his manuscripts, his books library , his belonging  museum are landmarks his life and work. This place now tourists prime attraction. We couple spent few hours here, and prayed for rest in peace."
Great place to connect with history,"During my recent visit to Ahmedabad, Sabarmati Ashram was one of the places on my list to visit.It is great how the authorities have preserved the place and have set up a small museum within it depicting the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi. The place also has a small gift shop where you can purchase memorabilia for yourself and gifting purposes. The Ashram looks over the Sabarmati river, hence the name and provides a very scenic view.Anyone wanting to get more knowledge about Indian history needs to visit this place when in Ahmedabad."
Official Visit,"It is basically a museum giving details of the life of father of the nation, ""Mahatma Gandhi"", his struggle, non-cooperation to British rule etc. Nice place to visit."
Sabarmati ashram,"For anyone interested in the life of Mahatma, this is a must visit...the simplicity of his life and how he touched t hearts of millions is portrayed well through the exhibits there.The ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati river is very calm with the trees providing shade to humans and many birds and squirrels....we can experience a soothing and relaxing feel with no disturbances and just the  birds chirping"
Interesting ,"Interesting and tranquil place along the river, gives you a good overview about Ghandiji’s life, nice view over the river"

Must Visit!,"You can't come to Ahmedabad and not visit here. Don't skip the museum. It has a very detailed chronology of Gandhi's life, including some wonderful letters."
Humbling experience,"A visit provides a new perspective, a serene location of Sabarmati river bank, a piece of history indeed. With prior appointment from The Secretary of the Trust, a walking tour can be organised. This 90-minute guided tour starts with a slide show and ends at the Library. A must visit place for sure."
Serene abode of bapu,"The ashram on banks of river sabarmati is a gentle reminder of our independence history, a place where iconic dandi  salt March started in 1930. The place is maintained spic and span, with heritage photos, Charkas and other reminiscent of gandhiji and kastubaji. A place that transformed Mohandas to Mahatma in true sense. Various timelines, photos and river view make it a place to be."
Good place to spend couple of hours ,It is a good place to spend couple of hours knowing the great work done by Bapu. Lots of squirrels 🐿 n monkeys 🐒
nice,sabarmati ashram is one of the oldest ashram .and such a well maintainedasram and near sabarmati river
Forgotten and bygone?,Had high expectations of this place as Gandhi is supposed to be the most famous son of the state of Gujarat. The Ashram is nothing but few establishments including a museum with only graphical recollections. Difficult to get the poignant portrait of the monumental man.
Must Visit,Must visit place in Ahmedabad. Calm and peaceful place on the banks of Sabarmati river. Needs maintenance. Washrooms are dirty and in bad condition!
an average place that people visit for Correa s architecture,Its an average place with some historical significance. Most people take a look at the old structure and a lot of architecture buffs come mainly for the new strcutures designed by Charles Correa - anything of this sort should have been way more interactive and engaging.
A must visit place,"A must visit place for everyone to know more details about Mahatma Gandhi’s life story, his struggle, sacrifice for the nation. A lot to learn and follow from his principles..."
Must Visit - No Entrance Fee,"This place has been transformed - I visited after 40 Years - need to spend between 3 to 4 hours - very nice presentation on the life of Mahatma, The Freedom Movement etcThey also have wheelchair accessVery clean toiletsGood Bookshop as well as Khadi Clothes shop"
Great experience,"We got to see the exhibits, the charkas and Gandhi's desk and table where he sat and worked. The staff provided us with an opportunity to try our hand at the Charka"
My father home - my home ,"I am not big fan of Gandhiji. I read few big books and chapters which come under our school classes. But last week when I got an opportunity to visit father of nation’s home I am deeply touched. Such a simple man with sound will power . Great .. total important life pictures / tales explaining vividly about Gandhi ji. On the banks of Sabarmati river aashram is very clean and green . Whether u like or not , it’s every Indian to visit his home .. you felt relaxed and motivated to do sth good for your country. Not to be explained in words . Upto you spend a minute or hours there ."
Calm and cool place,"It displays the life of Gandhiji.. has copies of handwritten letters, where he stayed and so on. Do not forget to buy a postcard from there and send yourself. The postal department affix a special charkha stamp which is only available if you send the postcard from inside the Ashram... just a memory.."
Amazing Experience !!! ,Loved visiting this place. I had my American Friend with me and he loved this place more than me. It’s a well-kept place at the bank of river Sabarmati and it gives you a serene feeling.
Read ahead to appreciate the site by Nicole Rovig,"Not unlike other historic places, this one focuses upon the purely positive works of Gandhi. Examining his full history and reasons for his direction will enrich the visit. Take your chose off and walk through his home. Great narratives and pictures provided throughout the site. Early morning is a great time to visit."
A superb collection of Mahata's history,"More than the huts where Gandhiji lived, I loved the historic collection of his photos and their naratives. Very well explained. If you are a history lover, the museum galary alone can take 2 hours so budget accordingly. Offers super views of the Sabarmati"
Serene Place,"It is located on the banks of Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad. It is popularly known as Gandhi Ashram. It has a museum,Vinoba Kutir, named after Acharya Vinoba who stayed here. Worth a visit as it reminds you the times and work of Mahatma gandhi."
Worship to Mahatma Gandhi,Gandhi Ashram a place of spiritual dignity to Indians. The Museum is well collection of Gandhi's activities against the British for freedom of India.
Nice place,Very nice place to visit and go through how the freedom moments have started. Nice to see the old photos of Mahatma Gandhi and others. I advise everyone to visit this place once to understand how our ancestors struggled to get freedom from British.
A must visit place for Knowledge update ,A visit to sabarmati ashram when you are in Ahmedabad is must. Surely one will admire the work done by Gandhi ji for our Nation. The perfect display of events in chronological order gives us much needed  knowledge.
Home of the history of India,"Gandhi Ashram at Ahmedabad, on the Sabarmati river,is a place which evoked strong conflicting emotions. I felt proud to be in the same place as the Mahatma, but extremely humble when I saw what he went through to give us this freedom that we take for granted. I felt sad to see that things that he fought for was now being negated (secularism) and amused when I saw an exhibit that showed how people sent letters to him. One of the addresses was simply ""The King of India, Gandhi, Delhi""! Despite spending time, I will definitely return one day to learn more about the enigma that he was. Believe me, we are not worth the struggle he put in for us."
History Comes Alive. Calm and Serene Vibe.,At the bank of Sabarmati River is this calm and beautifully made Ashram where history was made.India's Independence Struggle and the contribution of Mahatama Gandhi Ji is depicted in the museum.The book shop is also a good place to see.Must Visit with a relaxing and calm vibe to it.
A must visit for some history lessons for kids,It was a very good visit. Walk into some history if the independence fight of our country.Then ofcourse u also see the beautiful river which is maintained very well
Lovely place to visit,"Whether one is a fan of Mahatma Gandhi or not, this is a lovely place to visit. It is on the bank of Sabarmati river. The museum has every conceivable memorablia of the Mahatma, photos, hand writing, articles, models of various movements, you name it.  The campus also has the houses in which Mahatma Gandhi lived, as also smaller houses in which Vinoba Bhave and others lived. The campus is full of trees, peacocks, squirrels. My best moment was the selfie I took with a big photo of Sardar Vallabhabhai Patel."
Needed more information ,"Am an ardent history follower and the great place always read and Studied about, felt short when in real life."
Visit this place once to get to know Mahatma Gandhi well.,"This place is very well organized and maintained by the Government and it reflects the life of Mahatma Gandhi ""Father of Nation - India"""
Life og Gandhi,One of many museums in Delhi dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. This museum has many exhibits of items from the life of the great man.
Making of Mahatma ,We visited Aashram during December 2019. It’s well organised and well maintained aashram.Covers entire life of Bapu aka Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi aka Mahatma!Must visit for anyone visiting Ahmedabad.
Well maintained place,"A place of Mahatma Gandhi. The place is well maintained and very clean. One musume  is there. It was the resident of Mahatma Gandhi. His used ""Charka"" is there which was used to make traditional cloths during that time.Location is easily accessible via public transport. I suggest to book OLA AUTO for chip  and best way to travel."
Incredible site,Absolutely amazing place. Very clean and very well maintained. A real eye opener. A must visit. The shops could be managed a lot better.
Beautiful Ashram,"Beautiful place.  Good ambience with the Sabarmati riverfront.   Very neat and clean.  Very informative of Gandhiji's life and his valuable contribution to our freedom struggle.  Different types of ""Charkas"" shown with valuable information about them.  Very useful for students."
One of best place in ahmedabad,The ashram is well known with many things related to Mahatma hi being stored here in museum...Best place with peace and information to know..
National Attraction,A place of national and historical importance where Mahatma Gandhi lived . The exhibits there take you back in history and reminds one of the national struggle and Mahatma and other national leaders great contribution to our freedom.
Average place,Only visit if you have interest in history. It has collection of artifacts related to campaign and protest done by MG. The view of Sabarmati Riverfront from Ashram is amazing.
"Shabrmati ashram,new vadaj","Gandi bapu ashram near Sabarmati river ,new vadaj .

Pure simple life home ,"The place make you feel the simplicity is  enough to pass a life with wonderful results. I advise not to hurry up during the visit this simple/minimalist home place for Ghandi who set the freedom of İndia nation with many difficulties Small animals like sqaurrel, parrot etc happy more than any other place that I ever seen in this area. Pass time near the river and feel the spiruality as you can"
Peaceful,Very serene. The museum was very informative and presentation was done in question answer format making it very engaging.
Gandhi history maker,Excellent history and struggle Indians have to do get independence. A great reminder with photos and written words. It is Free. Well done
tourist point of view,"Pros: Sabarmati river viewCons: Not smartly presented visiting area, seems like sewing machine exhibition and park. As a traveller, doesnt meet my expectation."
MY LIFE IS MY MESSAGE - M.K. GANDHIJI,The entire complex truly reflects the ideals of Gandhiji. Place is very neat & clean.Wheel chair facility is available if required.
Must visit historical place in city,This is one of the best tourist attraction in Ahmedabad. It is well maintained place beside the beautiful Sabarmati river.There are many breathtaking views. Best time to visit place will be early morning or in afternoon. You will find all the historical information about the Mahatma Gandhi and the way he used to live. Its very clean and natural place to sit for long time and spend the rest of the day with nature.
Well maintained place to get information about mahatma gandhi,A place to get great details about mahatma gandhi and Kasturba's stay and activities at Sabarmati ashram.
Nice place,"Place is loocking so good and beautiful,sabarmati ashram is mahatma gandhi ashram,garden is beautiful and nice ppace."
Historical,This was a historic place to visit..A good experience ..A wonderful historic Ashram on the river bank A peaceful place in history for the struggle for independence nicely displayed
Peaceful and inspiring  place,"It's an inspiring and peaceful place , especially the bookshop it's right in the heart of city , but the place is very calm and very well maintained , the place has got strict time of closure do be sure to reach in time they close the place 5 to 10 min early then 6.30 pm"
Sabarmati Ashram,It was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi. Initially it was known as Satyagraha Ashram and later renamed.
Optimistic serenity,"Wherever you go in the world,you will not find peaceful serenity like this. You get to know why Gandhi hi choose only this place"
Enlightening,"A very special place with an inspirational story. I didn't realize what a revolutionary Gandhi was. He tried forcibly, but without violence, to change the harsh reality for his people. His methods succeeded in some ways and fell short in others. His legacy of Indian self sufficiency survives to this day. The Ashram exhibit tells the story of the liberation of the Indian people in picture and word. It glosses over a little on the great Hindu-Moslem divide that tore up the new nation into three countries. Surprisingly the exhibit shuts down at dusk. No lighting. A moving experience. Recommended."
Sabarmati Ashram,Wonderful...must visitA proud heritagePeaceful placeClean and coolSecure and well managedCulture display very good
Visit to Sabarmati Ashram,Nice to understand the vision that led Gandhiji through various initiatives. For sure a visit to the Ashram is a must and will be a nice learning experience.
The Father of the Nation ,Good and very silent place as expected. Throughout life journey of Bapu showed in terms of pictures. Nice garden outside.One time visit is fine.
Do not miss,Sabarmati Ashram is remarkably well preserved and worth a visit to see where the father of the Indian nation resided and where he worked from for India's freedom. There is a wonderful exhibition of photographs which also is recommended. It is important to keep at least one-two hours in hand in order to peacefully enjoy this place. It is certainly not meant for visitors who are not interested in history and have limited time in hand.
awsome,"this is a awsome place,amazing place for visit and awsome.experience of peace,awsome.place ,awsome.clean"
Peaceful and informative ,"Such a lot to discover about Gandhi, his philosophy and his life. Presented really well. Peaceful, welcoming environment. See people spin cotton as Gandhi did and you may even get an opportunity to try yourself.The book shop and clothes shop have good offerings too."
Historical and informative,Ahmedabad is a city with a lot to offer for tourists. Sabarmat ashram is one such destination which should be a must to-do on any tourist visiting ahmedabad. You can reminisce about the frugal lifestyle of the Father of the Nation - Mahatma. The Ashram very well depicts the independence struggle undertaken by Mahatma. It houses an Book shop and an Khadi store for tourists to shop and take home some part of the legacy of the place.
Sabarmati Ashram,This place is a must visit when in Ahmadabad. You can read about the life of Mahatma Gandhi and his contributions to the country n it's independence.
"a lovely ashram, and brings you peace when you visit.","we visited this wonderful ashram, and saw the various exhibits. truly tranquil, peaceful and got a wonderful experience."
Wonderful place,"Dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi's ashram at Sabarmati in Ahmadabad , this is a must visit place for all Indians . The genesis of Gandhi as a idea and his thought process are vividly captured through pictures and his quotes all over . Very well managed and nicely done ."
great ashram,"a lovely tranquil place built by Gandhiji, and a must see. we really liked it. the exhibits are great, the charkhas are awesome."
Gandhi ashram ,"Each and every thing about the Gandhi ji. Well maintained, neat and clean. This ashram situated on sabarmati river. So you can also go on sabarmati river front from the ashram."
Nice Place ,"This really a memorable one, when you are planning to get your mind relax with your family. When you go this place you will get more and more relaxed and peace. With the memory of bapu, you will be loved to visit again & again."
A wonderful place to find tranquility and inner strength,"Located at a quiet place at the banks of Sabarmati River where you can hear the whispers of your own soul.  It is also a place of great historic value, where even today visitors find some of the things which Mahatma Gandhi used -  writing desk, khadi kurta, yarn spun by him and some of his letters...A must visit place if you are in Ahmedabad."
"Gandhi Ji, Father of Modern India","For my money, this is the best place to visit in Ahmedabad. This is the actual area of land where Gandhi lived and worked during his time in Gujarat. There is a comprehensive and interesting series of exhibits about Gandhi's life. This is a bit of a no frills experience, however, the managers seem to be making regular updates to the property all the time improving on what is already there. There is also a worthwhile view of the river to enjoy. I only wish there was a place there serving chai, as that would have made our experience more enjoyable and sustainable over a longer period of time."
An unanswered question ,"We visited this place with my daughter and her friends. My daughter asked me, while traveling on Ashram road we reach to Ashram. We have lacs of Gandhi roads. Can we reach to the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi after traveling on them? I was speechless.It was not just another experience this time."
I like this place,"I  like this place I go here with my family during my summer vacation I enjoy here I like this place ,thank you"
freedom fighters pilgrimage.,"A place where freedom fighters were initiated by Mahatma Gandhi to his ideology and decipline.......he spent his meditative time to understand his self and absorbed principles of non cooperation and nonviolence has great powers to bring political change.....he practically used the place to bring change and install will power in freedom fighters at this place...... India's well known architect Charles Corea was appointed to develop new design and museum at the place ,which even today takes us to great history of Indian freedom movement......a must visit to understand Gandhi ji's character and personality."
Gandhi's first Ashram in India,This is Gandhi's first Ashram in India. It is the biggest tourist attraction. Located on bank of river Sabarmati. Must visit place.
Must see,I would definitely recommend a visit here.  You get a close insight into the man himself.  I was not disappointed
An obligator visit,You cannot visit India without acknowledging the great man. As you get nearer Udaipur it becomes more obvious the esteem in which he is held.The small museum is very good.
Must visit,"Definitely worth 3-4 hours of your time in Ahmedabad. Once you are done viewing the various places within the ashram, do make it a point to sit on the stairs that overlook the Sabarmati River and have a moment of your own"
DIDN'T MEET MY EXPECTATIONS,"I thought it to be a very beautiful,clean and quiet place since it was for Mahatama Gandhi...but I went just after Gandhi Jayanti day and I felt sad to see litter around the ashram. Its a very humble place ,but somewhere it was totalyy missing its aura.But may visit for  knowing Gandhis' struggle for nation ."
Stay at metropole close by,Stayed at metropole a beautiful hotel nearby Walking distance  good food gold staff to assist in every thing  required
Good place,Very nice place well managed by Gujarat government we well get to know a great part of our father of nation and its contribution for freedom .
Clam place,Nice place right at main road.very good information about Mahatma Gandhi ji. Good view of Sabarmati river and river front.
Truly Historic place wow,What an amazing place to visit. Truly mesmerizing and walked away leaning about Gandhijis life. Truly inspiring
Amazing Life & History,"A place worth visiting if you want to know anything about Mahatma Gandhi. His entire life history is shown. If you go in the evening, you can also enjoy the sound & light show. Please you can carry back a miniature charkha / books from the shop for a slice of history! Really worth visiting. Oh! And so tranquil & peaceful place inspite of being on a main road!"
Very peaceful place to relive the history of Gandhian era,"Well maintained ashram of Mahatma Gandhiji, his original cottage, charkhas, a picture gallery, located by the Sabarmati river with a beautiful view of the riverfront.You can actually go back in the history to relive the important events of India's freedom struggle like Dandi March."
Sabarmati Ashram,Museum of some of the letters written by and to Gandhi. Not recommended unless you have a few hours to kill.When we visited there was no electricity and although there was the Gandhi Jayanti program children's program on the background and also Modiji was scheduled a visit that day.The khadi store doesn't really have anything worth buying as a collectable.
Fantastic Experiece,"To relive the past, as we say is important. This place brings you all to life.. all that we have read in our books can be co-related and that's an amazing journey for all of us to undertake. The experience is humbling and extremely nostalgic to say the least. Would recommend to be there."
Profoundly Spiritual Place,I was surprised by how moving this place was. You can feel the incredible spirit of Gandhi and his remarkable achievement of liberating India from the British. Do not miss the chance to visit this spot!!!!
All about history and struggle,The place is awesome. It really gives goosebumps after reading what our previous generations had to go through to get independence from the Britishers. Place is very well maintained . Must visit for history lovers ...
Quiet and peaceful,"We had a really great time here. No noise. No words from people. Atmosphere makes you quiet here. Not even the city noise. The calm Sabarmati River adds beauty to the place. Lot of plants and so also the birds, most importantly the parrots. Information on Gandhiji is throughout the walls."
Historical,Small house where Mahatma Gandhi lived.  Excellent maintenence. Lot of people are visiting.  Not too rush....
Gandhi's Ashram,"An amazing place to learn about Mahatma Gandhi, his life in his own words. Peaceful and nice, it can be visited on any kind of day."
Not a tourist stop- go for what it represents,Museum is well done with lots of pictures and stories. Book shop also has good collection at reasonable prices. Other parts of Ashram are not so well maintained or curated. It is historic place so worth visiting but do take time to read since there is not much click worthy. However it is also very skippable if you don’t have academic interest or bent of mind to reflect or you are short on time.
Must See,It's takes you back to history and make you feel the pain our freedom fighters under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi I must visit place in Ahmedabad!
Good,"Good to learn how Gandhiji lived. A lot of old pictures, stories of his disciples are shown in a museum. House where he stayed with Ba (Kasturba Gandhi) is there to see. A lady demonstrating how Khasi threads are made is there. One can try doing self! Nice view of Sabarmati river bank is there."
Peace full place,It located at bank of sabaramti river. Asram related to gandhiji life. It very peaceful place and well maintained.
Calm and Serene behind Sabarmati river,"One should visit the place when in Ahmedabad...  The place where Bapu lived and major historical discussion were made. Got to read his message ""My life is my message"".  The place is well maintained and"

Well Planned Attraction,Walked to the ashram here stayed at The Metropole hotel amazing Experience in ahmedabad. didnt know that this beautiful attraction existed here
The place where person  proud to be Indian.,"Sabarmati Ashram is a historicall place in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.This was one of the homes of Mahatma Gandhi who lived there for around twelve years alongside his significant other Kasturba Gandhi. It was from his base here that Gandhi drove the Dandi walk otherwise called the Salt Satyagraha on 12 March 1930. In acknowledgment of the huge impact that this walk had on the Indian autonomy development the Indian government has set up the ashram as a national monument. The Sabarmati ashram gets around 700,000 guests per year whose requirements must be taken care of. It stays open for guests each day of the year from 8.00am to 7.00.pm.Collecting, preparing, safeguarding and showing authentic materials, for example, compositions, photos, works of art, voice-records, movies and belongings.Weather: Summer 32°C to 42°C Winter 12°C to 34°C"
Peacful,Its at Sabarmati riverfront and our father of nation stayed here for quite a long time. This Ashram introduces you to the life journey of Mahatma Ghandi and Independence struggle. Various types of 'Charkas' are also placed inside the premises.
Serence Place!!,"I have always loved this place, Since my college days. I have visited it a number of times. Must visit place for anyone coming to Ahmedabad. Part of Heritage!! Especially how beautifully they have preserved the antiques of Mahatama Gandhi."
Well kept.,"They keep the place with thoughtful maintenance. No new huge alien looking buildings. Instead the serene atmosphere is maintained. Lots of parakeets, mynahs, squirrels making use of the Oasis of tall green trees. Bapu's memory is well preserved. Ironically, the access from the ashram to the river front is blocked."
Gandhi ashram ,First time visit in gandhi ashram ahmedabad its so beautiful and voice less statue of Mahatma gandhiji and perticullare item of uses of gandhiji books and sabarmati river front nice view.
Peaceful and reminds the history,"The ashram is located on the bank of Sabarmati and well maintained. One can buy khadi udyog clothes and diary, pen, books and charkha from the shop inside the Ashram. I have learnt how to make thread from cotton by charkha. It's really amazing."
Bapu’s home,"No need any introduction. Name says it all. Everyone who wants know about Nation Father here is d place. Well Organised, Well develop . Once U visit here all our nation history rewind ur mind like movie."
Shrine in Mind,You will find yourself valuable as a human and shrine in mind. Sabarmati  river is adjacent to the Gandhi's Home.
"Wonderful experience, but could be a lot better",The Ashram is a must visit for visitors / tourists to the city. It is not too far from the city center.The museum especially can be better conceived and maintained.
A quite place to reflect on Gandhi's life,"Took refuge in the shades of the ashram to escape from the schorching sun of Ahmedabad. The place is a display of sorts of various events in Gandhi's life,and a small insight into his teachings. The ashram nearby has a khadi centre,where one can volunteer for work."
Memorial Day,"Sabarmati ashram is home of nations father, nice memories of sabarmati ashram, Good atmosphere, awesome place"
Peaceful and Knowledgeable,This is a must go place if you are visiting Ahmedabad. Don't miss the museum at the end. It overlooks the riverfront. You will feel peace as soon as you enter. Highly recommended.
Peaceful and quiet . ,"There is nothing much here just in case u are looking for a happening place . It’s quite and peaceful with some small cottages and a charkha that is use for making thread .  It’s a nice to be away from noise and sound sitting by the river and doing nothing sometimes , my daughter and I go there just to relax.  Talking about the the ashram it was where the father of the nation lived on the bank of the river Sabarmati. There is a place for funeral close by where the Hindu community burn the dead and offer prayers  . Also a handloom store where u get organic products my favourite it the liquid white rose hand wash it is really nice I generally so there to by my soap and khakras also u get woven cloth at economical price . The seasonal local sweets also available in the store . Once again it is not a happening place it’s a dead quite place very few articles on display. My daughter loves feeding the ants and this is one place where I can take her to feed them in peace no distraction also there is a sand pit there where the dogs wallow and my  three year old daughter finds it very interesting to watch actually this pit is for meditation that’s what the guards on duty told us . We go there all the time but I don’t have pictures as such ."
Reliving Gandhian life,"The museum is ok,will give you an insight.The house that Gandhi & his team stayed is a true example of a person's simplicity.The bare minimum furniture & size of the house are like ""walking the talk"".the timetable of ashramites is very good.walking in ashram along the Sabarmati river is very soothing."
Gandhi's birthday,Mohandas karamchand Gandhi the name is enough.but bapu is strong person who knows everything but not speak
Visit to Mahatma House,So peaceful as well as strong feelings come while you visit the Sabarmati ashram. The area has been maintained with its originality and the volunteer showing use of charkha is marvellous.
In memory of Mahatma Gandhi,"Mahatma Gandhi spent a good part of his life in this ashram that is on the bank of river Sabarmati. There is a big museum that essentially has photos and written accounts of the Indian freedom struggle. History buffs would have a lot to read in this museum. One can visit the actual simple hut of Mahatma Gandhi that has his room and his desk, his wife’s room a guest room and a kitchen. It is nonetheless impressive. A must visit place to pay tribute to the Father of the Nation."
Good place to know some history,Gandhi's life & struggle for independence is depicted in here through various pictures and sculptures. You can see the famous charaka that suns thread and helps in making Khadi clothing. Also the grounds face Sabarmati river and is maintained  neat & clean.
Serene,Mahatma. Great soul. Being a vastu consultant I believe in good energy. This place has information and art. Simplicity and grace but above all it has peace.
An amazing insight to a great man's life,"Featuring beautiful surrounds and a clean environment, visiting the Ashram not only educates you to the historical struggle for independence, but also gives you highlights of the great Mahatma Gandhi's amazing life.What a great man and it's lovely to see this Ashram well kept and a highlight of India's history."
Peaceful and inspiring,"Though my personal philosophy does not concur with Gandhiji's, the fact remains that visiting Sabarmati Ashram , seeing the place where the Mahatma lived and worked is very inspiring. The fact that it is on the banks of the Sabarmati make it all the more beautiful. Try to come on a week day, maybe in the morning, when it is less crowded, so you can absorb the atmosphere. There's a small khadi shop which is pretty good - you can buy a memento of your visit."
Superb place who want to know about Gandhiji,"Had visited place, thrice, every time it give peaceful experience. Museum is great and environment is superb. One must visit place when you are in Ahmedabad."
Place to learn Discipline,"Ashram consists of Museum (Gandhi at Ahemedabad, Picture gallery, My life my teachings), Magan kutir (Museum consisting of various types of Charkas for weaving cloth) Vinoba Kutir (A small hut where Vinobhabhave lived), Hruday Kunj (Home of Gandhi and Kasturba from 1919 to 1930). It took around 2 hrs to see the full Ashram. Learnt new things, recalled about independence movement, Gandhiji's role in Indian independence). Don't forget to post a letter or Gandhiji's picture available at book shop to get crossed by Charkha stamp by India post. I received the letter 😊 with Charkha crossing."
Peaceful abode,On the Sabarmati Riverbank lies this Ashram where you can still hear in air lingering voice of Gandhiji as if chanting evening prayers.
Must see on any visit to the region,"The museum is great, provides a great look into what Mr. Gandhi meant to the area and the country. My favorite thing was that the area is left open and kids are playing cricket on the grounds. It's not a shrine, it's part of the city and the area and the city treats it as such."
“Peaceful”,"This place is where The Father of This Nation, Shri. M.K. Gandhi lived for the most of his life. This place is very peaceful and contains a lot of information about the beginning of the ashram to how it progressed, one who likes to read such historical information, will be fascinated by the amount of reading material on display.Gandhi Ji’s house is also kept well maintained with some other houses as well, there’s a also a souvenir shop where you can get many books on him, along with the famous “Khadi” cloth which was promoted widely by Gandhi.Must visit at least one time!"
Breezy Riverside Ashram,"Apart from anything else, Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram has a lovely location. Set alongside the Sabarmati River, it enjoys cooling breezes which waft through the leafy compound.There are two main parts to this complex. The first part is a museum which explains about Gandhi's philosophy and campaigns. It does this mostly through the use of quotes from the great man. There is also an effective use of period photography. The second part contains original buildings from when Gandhi and his wife lived here from 1918 to 1930. The simple cottage evokes his non-materialistic worldview effectively."
Serene place,"Amazing place. The ashram is beautifully set along the banks of river sabarmati. It has a quaint library. There is a little outlet for handmade products on the right side along the main entry. There are various items available such as greeting cards, keychains, scarves, etc which are made by the slum kids residing nearby."
History revised,Very well kept N recalled d lessons of history book Parking available U can c d charkha up n close Must visit
remembering mahatma,very sacred place for us.we must visit and feel the greatness of mahatma.very informative for kids .govt has to take strict actions as somany young couples are coming eating there as it is a park.
Family outing,We went for family outing and it was really nice visit here.One should surely visit and see the beautiful view.
A place which doesn't hold truth about Gandhi,"This is a very overrated place in Ahmedabad. The view near the riverfront is nice but that can be found better at many places in Ahmedabad such as near NID.The information provided about Gandhi is much overhelmed but if you are aware about History, you can clearly understand many things are lie.Can visit once but as I said just for bunch of lies about our so called great Nation father."
The Land of Mahatma,It is the land of Mahatma Gandhi who gave the concept of non-violence and Satyagrah. It gives the message to the public and the rulers to solve the problems with Non-violence.
Overrated and hyped!!!,"well this is a place where Gandhiji lived and took some very important decisions of our freedom struggle but you have to be an ardent fan of gandhiji to love this place- truly speaking. The gandhi smriti in Delhi also gives us fairly good insight into Gandhiji's living as a simple and great men so sabarmati ashram s offers nothing new,,,yes we are nostalgic to see the place where he lived you might enjoy. There should be more exhibits and some film/ documentary room to show his real character and make the place more lively."
Time Travel,"A visit to Sarbarmati Ashram would take you back right to the time he lived there, evoking thoughts and emotions very difficult to express, particularly in stark contrast to what is happening just outside its campus, in Ahmedabad and other places of our country."
what an amazing place!!,This place is a must visit for any Indian...It's beautifully maintained and gives an insight to the person behind the Mahatma as well as the freedom struggle that our country went through!!
Ahmedabad's landmark,"Gandhi ashram is a calm, serene and peaceful place at the bank of Sabarmati river. One  can know the history of Gandhi ji, his movements for freedom and his principles at picture gallery in detailed way. There are many types of charkhas and the ashram people demonstrate how to make khadi thread from cotton.Gandhi, Kasturba and guest room are well preserved as it is.There are daily prayers in the ashram. I think  Ashram needs more green landscaping and maintenance. Nice place to visit in Ahmedabad."
Sabarmati GAndhi Ashram,"Its Worth Seeing Great Freedom FIghter Gandhibapu's Ashram Where he Stayed (Hradaykunj),His Spectacles,RENTIYA_For Waeving Khadi Located @ Bank of River Sabarmati from Where You can See beatiful Riverfront Garden's Roads developed by Ahmedabad Muni.Corporation.One can get peace of MInd.Evening's Sound & Light Show is worth watching(One has to enquire about Days before goinf."
Must visit,"I am from Ahmedabad only , I follow simplicity with minimum requirements and speak truth their are 11 points of Mahtma Gandi need to follow in life"
Family get together,"Peace and quiet place to be, place where gandhiji spent good time during British power. Must watch their charkha and letters. Best letter is to Mr. Hitler."
Gandhi Satyagraha Ashram,"Sabarmati Ashram is located in the Sabarmati suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, adjoining the Ashram Road, on the banks of the River Sabarmati, four miles from the town hall. This was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi who lived at Sabarmati (Gujarat) and Sevagram (Wardha, Maharashtra) when he was not traveling across India and was not in prison. He stayed in Sabarmati and Wardha for a total of twelve years along with his wife Kasturba Gandhi."
Must see for Gandhi lovers and if you are in Ahmedabad,Nine place to visit and spend 1-2 hours knowing about history. Environment is very peaceful and entry is free! There's nothing more to do in Ahmedabad so do visit this place if you are in the city.
Feel the history,"The sober , peaceful environment has been preserved. Important events listed there lets you to connect the present, the reality and the movie Gandhi.There is a separate new, modern building that acts as the museum holds more interesting events/personalities which high school history does not highlight"
Nice Peaceful Place !!,We had a great time at Ashram with kids. Worth to visit with family. Really helpful to understand the complete history about Gandhiji.
"Sabarmati Ashram, 01 Sep'18","01 September, 2018.This monument is one of the main reasons people come to visit Ahmedabad.The Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had established hissimple settlement on the banks of the river Sabarmati, a placewhich has been preserved over the years, as the Sabarmati Ashram.The place has sufficient signage, and extensive information aboutthe history of the place, the different buildings, has nicephotographs and historical artifacts, and has clean washrooms.The place is as neat and clean as Gandhiji would have liked it tobe, across the ages. The Sabarmati river flows in the background."
Must  for everyone,You are taken  back in history. Good for  young  and  old. Must visit  even if you are not  connected to the ideology.
Sabarmati Ashram,"Famously associated with Mahatma Gandhi, it depicts his complete life in a manner that leaves you enchanted and glued to be there and see every nook and corner of this Ashram. His some of the belongings have been nicely kept and maintained in original condition.One has to visit to experience and absorb the serenity of this heavenly ashram where Mahatma resided for years."
Well maintained historh,The belongings of Mahatma Gandhi are kept with utmost care and the records of  history of post independent India and the actions carried out to get the freedom are all placed in a detailed manner. Apart from this the ashram also has shops that promotes 'khadi'. The place is a must visit for history lovers.
take your time...soak in the atmosphere,museums and memorabilia of gandhi...beautiful riverfront....well-stocked khadi store...best to go with a bit of time...and soak in the environment
A historical place,"for us , senior citizens , who have heard a lot from our previous generation about Gandhi , this visit was very illuminating and educative . Beautifully maintained , nice displays and superb visuals ."
Gandhiji home,it is the place where gandhi ji used to live. You get to see various aspect of his life over here. must visit
Gandhi Ashram,It is located on the opposite side of Sabarmati Riverfront. It is nice place. Here their is peace and nice environment with fresh air. The things are well cleaned and managed. Here we can also listen the voice of birds easily. It is the place were Gandhiji has lived. Here their is home of Mahatma Gandhi also with his cherkha. Here we can see all photos and read also the things done by Mahatma Gandhi.Aftet this we can go down for seeing the river. Here they have put the machine of cloth making which had come after cherkha. Here many President and Prime Minister of different countries have visited. And they have also written their view in the book which have putten their. Must visit to see the life style of Mahatma Gandhi.
The residence of a global icon,"f you're in Ahmedabad and you are interested in Indian history then Sabarmati Ashram is worth a visit. You will learn about the Indian struggle for independence, to break away from the British yoke. Mahatma Gandhi was and still is a global icon and the visit will give you a sense of peace and spirituality.Given that we are now in the 21st century I think that the curators could do a lot more with the exhibition , its a bit basic in its current form.It would have been nice to see film of him speaking that sort of thing"
Must see and experience Museum in Ahmedabad!,"If you're in Ahmedabad and want to spend quality time studying Indian history, it's freedom struggle and the inspirational life of Our true hero, Bapu Gandhi, this is the place you should head for. I assure you, as a tourist, you won't be disappointed with all that Bapu taught us through his life. From his life in a chronological order to his welcoming a dalit family to his ashram to the pain on passing away of Ba (Kasturba Gandhi's pet name) and finally to spearheading the freedom struggle, the Museum is an emotional journey for Indians. Don't miss!"
Serene place,The place is well maintained and it gives a calm and soothing feeling.  Lots of information are available with photographs. Next to the river.  You can enjoy the riverfront also.
Visited this Ashram in the Evening with my spouse on Friday,We were hoping for some assistance or guide as this a prime place of interest of our Father of the Nation. The staff was lazy and did not seem to be interested in their job and the same was evident in the property not very clean. Both the souvenir shops were untidy and the staff least interested. Need better signage and access to the River Front open. Will not recommend unless you have a Guide.
A must for anyone interested in India,"This ashram was where Mahatma Gandhi lived for about 12 years of his early active life on the Indian political scene. He planned many of his major campaigns from here. He set into motion his plans for uplifting villages, lower-caste people, women and the poor. He fine tuned his vision for a rising India and started his famous Dandi salt march from here. It is a calm, quiet and simple ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati River. It gives the visitor a great sense of what those times were like, how simple and kind Gandhiji was and how lofty his thoughts were. One must come here to really understand the man and the greatness of his message of nonviolence. Such people are born after many generations and a trip to the ashram is like a pilgrimage."
Sentiments within not without,"It was my own feelings for Gandhi that made this visit special. Otherwise, this was a big disappointment. Ample opportunity to recreate Gandhi's stay here: has not been explored at all. The Ashram's 11 rules could have been exemplified, but sadly not done. For example, when I went into the book store, there was very loud exchanges by the staff there, instead of tranquility. Contrast that with the ""noise in the kitchen"" letter by Gandhi on display in the museum here. Would have been nice if there were soul-stirring music or bhajans in Gandhi's house. Feel sad that the Mahatma's hub of activity has been mostly neglected and forgotten by the powers that be."
Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Asharm,This was a matter of pride and privilege for me to visit this place known as  Gandhi’s home and Ashram. It is a calm and relaxing place to be with lot of educative  information to learn about his life and history. A must visit place for modern generation.All VVIP or foreign delegates who come to Gujarat visit this place invariably.
Very interesting,"A really informative place full of Gandhi history, pictures. It is very clear from this place why he was such a wonderful person, just wanting the best for his country and trying to keep peace amongst his people."
Expirence with heritage,"I wanted my little girl to know about Gandhiji. What can be a better place than Gandhi ashram. Even in March it has cool temperature, museum takes us in the era of freedom fighters. It has quotes from Gandhiji. It has statue of Kasturba and Gandhiji, 3d image of Dandi March."
Gandhi Babu's sweet memories. ,A historically important place. Must see. Depicting the whole life story and patriotic  incomparable life style of Shri Bapu ji. An inspirational place.
A place of huge significance ,What a privilege to find myself at Gandhi’s home and Ashram. It is a calm and relaxing place to be with very good information to learn about his life and history.
Good,"Sabarmati ashramam, a must visit place  to know our rastrapithav, good atmosphere and neet place , we likes the place"
An important part of Indian history,No visit to Ahmedabad would be complete without coming here.The museum has photos and quotes by Gandhi and laid out in a very easy to follow manner.A wonderful legacy for freedom
Gandhiji's Abode,This is Gandhiji's Home as the title says. It is a museum about gandhiji's life and struggles. You can visit here to learn amazing things about him and the freedom movement of India. It is located right next to the Sabarmati river and the place itself is very calm and serene. There are shops inside where you can buy books and other memorabilia. Overall a great place if you like to delve into history
a nice visit,"I enjoyed my visit to Sabaramati Ashram in Ahmedabad.  We had no tour guide so we leisurely walked through the area reading the various notes depicting the life, history, and struggles of Mahatma Gandi.  I didn't know much about the his history but this visit enlighten me very much about his life.  The pace was nice and the place wasn't very crowded which made for a relaxed couple of hours.  There were many photos and original letters from him which I found interesting.  I wish there was a tour guide available which I would have happily paid for a more comprehensive review of his history and the facility.  In any event, this place is a required visit for anyone visiting Ahmedabad."
Well Maintained,This is a must visit place if you are in Ahemadabad. It's a very well maintained place with a lot of photographs which narrates history. I would have appreciated if there were signboards with directions as it's a very big area to explore on our own.
Had to be seen,A museum full of photographs and printed Ghandi quotes. Well presented but nothing special or different. Location by river. Seems to be more reveered by visitors than natives who feel things have moved on. Learnt more about the personal side of a national figure. Think it somewhere visitors should go
An evening in Sabarmati Ashram,If you want to spend good time in Ahmedabad city then you must visit Sabarmati Ashram. The man who changed Indian freedom strugle movement and showed the way to movement is still be felt in every corner in the ashram. The museun has pictorial depiction of entire life of Gandhi ji but few more actual items would make it more attractive to the present generation.
A glimpse into the history,The Ashram offers a glimpse into the pre-independence era of Indian History. One can imagine what all went there during the struggle for independence. The place is very well maintained and one of the most famous places to visit in Ahmedabad. Definitely worth a visit for 1-2 years.
Substantial piece of history,The ashram was just around the corner from our hotel so it was an easy choice to visit. This site represents an important piece of history for not just India but the world as a whole. My only comment is that it would be nice if it had more information within
Motivating ,"Being an Indian, Mahatma Gandhi and (his) Sabarmati Ashram are well known to me. It took me years to stop ignoring Gandhiji. I have read his books and though I disagree with some of ideas, he always gives me something to ponder.I was in Ahmedabad for some work and gladly took the opportunity to visit the Ashram. The museum is inspiring and I kept on wondering how he revolutionized the concept of Revolution. His 'Talisman' (photo of the quote is attached) is my all time favorite.The 'audio - visual' room, the book shop, the river view - everything is nice, cool and thought provoking. Though I would like more security to the place and some display of documentary schedule would be useful.Overall good place to visit and to understand not only Mahatma Gandhi but also India - then and now."
 Nice place to visit,Historical properties are kept in well manner and doing proper maintenance for the same.We can see almost all old model machines at this place. So many types of Charkha is kept inside this place. Photography is also allowed at this place.Beautiful view of Lake we can see from back side of this ashram.Do visit at least once if like to visit historical places.
A Worth Visiting Place,"Its a beautiful place on the banks of River Sabarmati. Its very well kept very neat and clean place. It show cases the life of the Mahatma very nicely, important events of his life are very well presented.The entry is free and you will need 2-3 hours if you want to go through everything in detail.Its definitely worth a visit."
Serene & inspiring visit ,What a visit it was.. Got the chance to see the ghandhi ji's lifestyle of their time. Extremely serene environment. One can see the original 'charkha' used by Bapu. U can also see his room & his original belongings. A very gud museum is also set in there. View of sabarmati river from ashram is very nice.
Do not waste time visiting this place,This place was hardly 100 meters from our hotel. Visited this place in the evening and we spent more time in commuting to this place and back than viewing the attraction. Would recommend not to include this place in your itinerary.
Very informative,If you're interested in the life of Mahatma Gandhi and are wanting to walk around the ashram that has been converted into a museum then it's worth a visit. There is no entry fee and the vibe here is very peaceful.
For Gandhi lover,It is very informative place for Gandhi lovers and it also has light and sound show plz inquiry about this before going but its most visit place in ahmedabad and it had got brilliant view of river front and u can get lots of beautiful pictures too Also there are shops opposite Gandhi ashram which sell pure khadi cloths and accessories and good made from khadi and they are absolutely worth it
Historic,A place that is part of the history of modern India. it is here that the Mahatma started his fight.Many interesting documents.
Peace ,"Holy place with birds chanting all around , silence and prayers. River view and peace. Must visit this place to see where Mr. M. K. Gandhi lived his entire life with simplicity without any extra belongings."
Historical place,This place is filled with history in every nook and corner. Father of nation mahatma gandhi has worked here along with other legends. The photographs and paintings bring the vivid picture of freedom struggle and the message of tackling political people or people with money power through sheer will power and educating the masses. Must visit place with kids to learn about Gandhi’s message.
Gandhi ji,"A place every Indian must visit.As we planned our visit to Ahmedabad the first place on our list was Sabarmati Ashram.A very serene,quite and beautiful place.Makes one immensely  proud being there.Trust me you would love to spend some time there."
Superb location to know History of Mahatama Gandhi,This place is so peaceful & full of knowledge about Great Mahatma Gandhi.  The pictures displayed are rare and unique.
A piece of history,"One of the wonders of Ahmedabad in this place Gandhi lived and explained his beliefs, just close to the river."
Peacefull area,"Khowing Gandi had lived there, the environment gave peaceful mind. One story buildings and cloth making mechines tell the simple life of Gandi. View to the river and observing peacocks wandering around is joyful."
Full of history,"Quiet place with a good retrospective of the life of the Mahatma. Pictures, tools,Gandhi belongings. Right next to the river."
Historic place of Bapu's Memory,"Its a historic place of Ahmedabad. One of the most tourist attraction in City. All memories of Satyagraha, Mahatma Gandhi.You can buy historic books related to India's freedom and biography. Located on Sabarmati Riverfront. Very beautiful place to visit"
Sabarmati Ashram,"An Awesome place, well maintained, neat & Clean right on the bank of river front. We took Ahmedabad day tour package hence has Guide to explain us all the detailed info about the ashram. It was fantastic tour.There is souvenir shop inside sells products at very cheaper price."
Historic,"Whatever be your views regarding Mahatma Gandhi, you cannot deny the importance of Sabarmati Ashram. It occupies, and will always occupy, a position of utmost importance in the history of India's independence struggle and post-1947 polity.A must visit.There are beautifully curated displays of Gandhiji's personal belongings, photographs, letters, narrations of key events like the Dandi march and salt satyagraha and Ganghiji's philosophy. There are displays of various types of Charkhas or spinning wheels used to weave khadi cloth. The cottage where Gandhiji and Kasturba lived will amaze you with its simplicity and sparseness. The ashram houses a shop which sells a range of items - handmade soaps, books and especially illustrates ones for children are highly recommended. They also sell khadi cloth, suits and other items of clothing.There is a post office from where you can send a postcard to your residence. It will arrive with a special commemorative stamp and postmark."
Nice and peaceful place,Very nice ashram on the banks of the river Sabarmati.  Quite and serene atmosphere.  Well maintained.  One can easily spend about 2 -3 hours going around.  They also have a book store where tourists can buys some mementos as take away.
A JOURNEY TO THE SOIL ONCE BAPU WALKED..,"Calm and peace. That's what you feel when you come out of the place. You feel respect and a reverence for the place where once Bapu lived. It is nothing short of a place of worship. But the male staff I encountered there had not even been courteous. Strange for a place immortalised by the apostle of peace! May be they are govt employees. Don't really know.But I met a lady there, Mrs Latha Parmar on the Charkha  at the hut where Kasturba Gandhi once lived. She was graceful in her conduct.  She explained how the Charkha works and how Gandhi used it as a tool for furthering his spiritual escapades.  She was kind enough to explain things in detail and even taught me how a Charkha works with a hands on experience. Thankful to her."
Great peace of mind,"This place is full of positive energy. You will get amemorable experience over here. there is no tickets for this place. Parking is a problem, so prefer private taxies or auto on weekends. If you are visiting this place for full day, keep water and food along with ypu."
Historical & peaceful,The house & workplace of Mahatma Gandhi. A place which has witnessed a lot of history. Was peaceful to visit. A brief description of major events of Mahtama Gandhi's life are written.
A great man - his life- his words-his passions ,"Tranquil, educational and worth a visit.  The persistence of the children trying to sell their wares was adorable. But sadly will stick to you like glue until you leave lol"
Interesting,Well laid out photos and explanations  giving insight  into the life of Gandhi. There are a couple of buildings showing spinning wheels and his living quarters with writing desk. Worth a visit for its calm peaceful atmosphere and the interesting gift shop with realistically priced gifts and crafts. Free entry and they very kindly allowed us to leave our ruck sacks in the office.
Peaceful and Serene.,House of Mahatma Gandhi. Tells a lot about history and culture. Really inspiring and amazing. Superb location.
A inspiring visit,"It was a wonderful experience visiting the Sabarmati Ashram. The man""s sacrifice to get us freedom through non violent means is worth emulating. Amust visit place for every Indian citizen"
Peaceful !!!,"Located on main road and well maintained, very peaceful place with nature, behind the ashram sabarmati river is flowing, the view of the river is awesome."
Childhood dream,"In my school time, I had heard of this ashram, since then I had a desire to see it. Now the years have passed and the desire has come true. My heart is pleased with this house of Gandhiji. Must visit."
Birth Place of Freedom movement ,"It’s the historical place where Mahatma Gandhi with Kasturba and other disciples stayed long time and started freedom movement to free Bharat from British India rule. New photos and memory lane from the beginning of Mahatma’s life to the last years. So many pictures depicting Gandhiji’s life style and his tremendous work for our country is seen here. His kutir, Prarthna sthal, kept as it is. Worth visiting to know the history of ‘Freedom movement ‘. Maintained as it is. A nice place to ponder over on the bank of Sabarmati River ."
"Beautiful, peaceful. Worth visiting.",This was a wonderful place to visit to learn more about Gandhi's life and thinking. Peaceful grounds with views of the river too. I would recommend to friends to visit if they are in the city.
Awesome & Historic place to must visit,"Sabarmati Ashram was an absolutely wonderful visit. The environment is calm and the property has been well designed.o show our kids on how our history was. You can see everything about BAPU here. Also, just behind the Ashram, you can see SABARMATI river. Really enjoyed reading and looking at the photographs of Mahatma Gandhi, his journey and reminding myself of the great deeds he did for India and humanity.The place has so much of rich history."
Wonderful visit,Had a couple of spare hours and decided to visit the Ashram. It was an absolutely wonderful visit. The environment is calm and the property has been well designed. I really enjoyed reading and looking at the photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and his journey and reminding myself of the great deeds he did for India and humanity. A very moving experience for me and would highly recommend it.
Awesome place to visit,"This is an awesome place to visit. To show our kids on how our history was. You can see everything about BAPU here. Also, just behind the Ashram, you can see SABARMATI river..."
Must visit,Sabarmati ashram is very well kept and it takes you back to the historic era. The place has so much of rich history. It’s a must visit when you visit Ahmedabad!
Decent,"There's not much to see or do in Ahmedabad, and this is one of the few things.It's a bit shabby for what had been the residence of someone considered a saint. There are no real objects in the museum, mostly text. The good thing is that it explains Gandhi's philosophy and the way he came to it in quite a lot of detail. Naturally, it's not a very objective (rather, adoring) description, and sometimes the meaning behind a number of Hindi terms is unclear.View on the river is okay, a bit industrial."
"Pretty Big area, river front location and Peaceful","I had a lot about the Ashram during my school day and finally got a chance to visit it.   It is a pretty big place on the banks of Sabarmati river.  The river front has been well developed.   The Ashram offered a respite from the hustle bustle outside.    Gandhijis meeting room, living quarters, other people connected to the Ashram can be visited/viewed.  The Ashram is well laid out with parking.  A gift shop is available to purchase many items related to Gandhiji's life.   A small museum with various types of Charkas used is located within the Ashram.  The best thing is that the Ashram is free to visit and pretty well maintained.    Located not far from the airport.   Around the ashram are many handicraft shops.  The Ashram is historical for its connection to Indian Freedom Movement."
Must visit,Must visit site while visiting Ahmedabad. This is a very important site of Indian History. The place is very well preserved. Its very clean and full of trees. Lots of birds and squirrels around. The ghat along the river is a very nice place to spend some time.
Beautiful.,"Sabarmati Ashram, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is a fine example of history and struggle. Living up to Mahatma's principles, the ashram is peaceful, clean and beautiful. A must visit for anyone interested in Indian hidtory. A detailed visit to the ashram would take roughly two hours. There are guides/volunteers who explain the history of the place. The iconic 'charka' is placed inside Mahatma's chamber,which is opened 10-25 times a day. The ashram has two stores that sell bookmarks, postcards, pens and other kinck nacks. Have a wonderful visit!"
Peaceful,It is a peaceful place. I suggest to read history and about GandhiJi before visiting to enjoy the visit to Ashram to the fullest.
Gandhi ashram,I m visiting so many times at Ahmedabad sabarmati ashram . It's nice place to visit. Gandhi's so many memories.
Calm & Peace,"Good place , Bapu's life history with exhibition, properly displayed. Very nicely done. Gift/ book shop with khadi fabric made items are on display n sale. View of Sabarmati is just grt, of course birds humming will make you feel that you are not in Ahmedabad"
Historical place in memory of father of nation,"Ashram is having collection of all the memories of BAPU. It contains all of their favourite activity tools like rentiyo, his personal usage bed, spectacles etc. Also having rich collection of books."
To know the history of Mahatma Gandhi’s stay In Sabarmati Ashram.,Assam is maintained very well and Mahatma Gandhi’s life stay was well explained at all the places. Well directed routing.
A beautiful and peaceful place,"A wonderful place to visit. Very informative and a great way to learn more about Mahatma Gandhi, a freedom fighter"
Very peaceful and insightful,"Wonderful place to see and learn more about Ghandi. On the riverbank, quiet and beautiful to walk around."
So much more could be done,Sabarmati Ashram is a main tourist place of Ahmedabad but nothing much is done to promote it. So much could be done to make it more informative and nice.Was a bit disappointed here.
A place to remember the mahatma..,"Sabarmati ashram is a must visit place if you visit ahmedabad.i visit the place on gandhi birthday which is 2 Oct , on that day the ambiance of the ashram was great."
Understanding the truth with piece ..,It's free to explore but must place to visit if you are in Ahmedabad. You will feel the sense of piece and truth around the location.
Informative,"A historic visit to those who have an interest in Gandhi's movement. The place is huge, well-preserved and free of charge.Locals come here to spend time with families. The building on the left side is full of information of the movement with English language translation. The pictures available are not somewhere we can easily see online."
Must visit,Very nicely maintained. Loads of thing to see and read. if u r a history lover...dont miss this place. it has a beautiful lake adjoined. u can also buy khadi products.
Good historical visit,The ashram itself has been kept very clean though i am nit sure if there are multilingual tours for people coming from several parts of the countryits more a trip to sink in the experience of revisiting history through Gandhiji's stories. the audio visuals could definitely do with inprovement but the premises and exhbits are kept very clean. it has a great view of the riverfront which has been completely revamped and done up well.
Reminiscent of the times of Mahatma ,"The name that involuntarily & immediately pops up upon the mention of Sabarmati Ashram is Gandhiji. Mahatma Gandhi along with his wife Kasturba Gandhi spent some 13 years of his life in the Ashram and started many ‘movements’ from here, ‘Dandi March’ being the most prominent amongst them.Mahatma Gandhi’s home in the Ashram was ‘Hriday Kunj’, which is also the centre of attraction for most visitors. One can see the Writing Desk and the ‘Charkha’ that was used by Gandhiji, beside many other items that are there on display (other than the Desk & the Charkha most of the other items are replicas).‘Vinoba-Mira Kutir’ is a small two roomed hut where Vinoba Bhave & Mira behn lived.What is apparent and impresses most is the simplicity & minimalist approach that was hallmark of Gandhian philosophy. The Museum, the Photo & Art gallery are other places of interest in the Sabarmati Ashram. One can also have a nice view of Sabarmati river from the Ashram."
A must Visit ,"I was overwhelmed with the beauty, and space of the entire, well kept property. We read about Sabarmati Ashram in school,  and all the great efforts Mahatma Gandhi ji made for our independence. The big display of many events is well presented at the ashram. The prayer hall is so touching. My imagination flew back to the time when Gandhi ji would have met with his people there. Kasturba ji's rasoi and her room, with a garden which has a sweet little gate made my heart very warm. Sabarmati river view is beautiful from there.  The room with charkhas is amazing to see. The monkeys with long tail run around freely.  The gardens and property is huge,  and the trees are tall and proud. All in all I was filled with gratefulness to all great Beings who brought us freedom and we could live in an Independent India. You must not miss seeing Sabarmati Ashram if you go to Ahmadabad."
serene,"calm quiet place on the riverbank ,  ideal to reflect or meditate .and see the life of Mahatma in pictures ."
Calm,A visit to Ahmedabad is not complete without a visit to Gandhi Ashram on the banks of Sabarmati. Successive governments have tried to maintain the Ashram in its original shape. The photo gallery is quite informative & spending 2-3 hours here gives you a surreal feeling that takes you back in the times of the Father of the Nation
"Peaceful, Spacious, Beautiful ","It a good place to sit and relax for sometimes, next to sabarmati river, its an old ashram connected with the city through bus and taxi. I went there on my solo trip to Gujarat."
"Was disappointed, a important historical place presented poorly","We went with high expectation since Sabarmati Ashram was an important historical place, have great respect for Gandhiji, but were disappointed, no signs or direction to the place, poor up keep and presentation. Same place in US would be a major tourist attraction for international visitors, more information, better up keep of garden, etc."
Damp Squib,Was dissapointed...the sanctity of the place was dilluted by modernisation...it was not very communicative in terms of models or even documentary...it was not very educative for the children...it could do with atleast a documentary on the historical value of the place.
Shanti,"A very peaceful place with lot of memories attached to the Mahatma, Right at the edge of river Sabarmati. Lot of birds (parrots mainly)"
Sabarmati aashram,"Good to visit.had a proud feeling.well kept area,very clean. books on display are worth buying,a must visit for those going to ahmedabad.very disciplined atmosphere"

The ashram located on the banks of the sabarmati river has preserves of Mahatma Gandhi's belongings and also has rich history depicted in musuem. Beautifully described in a manner which kids can also read and understand. A book store sells books and various other things at very nominal price.The place is good for people who are interested in historical facts.

Gandhi Ashram best place to visit in Ahmedabad,"Dont think there are any better places to visit in Ahmedabad than the Sabarmati or Gandhi Ashram. It is very nicely maintained and has all the information about Mahatma Gandhi. There is no entrance fee and no camera fee.

Vacation trip,"Cleanliness means keeping ourselves neat and clean by avoiding dirt. It is the best practice to keep everything clean. According to the type of things, we can divide cleanliness into various types such as cleaning of clothes, cleaning of streets, cleaning of surroundings, cleaning of houses, cleaning of person, personal cleanliness, etc. In order to maintain our personal cleanliness, we need to practice cleanliness very carefully and make it a most important habit. It is very necessary to maintain the cleanliness of surrounding together with our personal cleanliness. We should understand the importance of cleanliness and do practice of cleaning ourselves and surrounding areas.We should follow as well as teach kids of home to practice teeth cleaning, hand washing, bathing, and other cleaning habits. People who are used to of keeping themselves dirty, they also keep their surrounding areas and environment dirty and filthy. That’s why they always suffer weakness, weak health, infections, various types of diseases, etc. So, it is very clear that we should keep ourselves and environment clean in order to be healthy, happy and free of diseases.If we talk about our health (physical, mental, social and psychological), we notice that how important the personal cleanliness and cleaning of environment is necessary for us. The whole environment is our home which we need to keep clean in order to be healthy forever. Some people understand the importance of cleanliness very well and follow all the cleanliness habits; however some of us throw wastes and dirty things on road which gets spoiled and make them ill. If a clean environment can keep our mind and body healthy; in the same way, a dirty environment puts bad effect on our body and mind. Many people suffer infectious diseases because of infectious agents in the dirty environment. Disease causing agents become very active in the dirty and filthy environment and can cause diarrhea, cholera, hepatitis, flu, etc"
A monument that marks the important chapters in Indian History,"The place is like an open history book, giving a glimpse into the life of the Mahatma and in turn India's quest for independence. Its peaceful and serene on the banks of the river Sabarmati. Gives an insight into how life can be simple yet so fulfilling."
A monument to The Mahatma,"The Ashram, residence of Mahatma Gandhi, the biggest nationalist, pleading nonviolence and winning freedom for India , is a simple memorial, having some original items of his use. A rather simple place but generates the feeling of Nationalism."
Awesome good place and worth to visit,"Awesome and worth to visit, I can see location is good and cleanliness is good as tourists can visit once no entry fee"
Must see place for Mahatma Gandhi followers ,"Sabarmati Ashram also known as Gandhi Ashram is located in the Sabarmati suburb of Ahmedabad. It was from his base here that Gandhi led the Dandi march also known as the Salt Satyagrah on 12 March 1930. The ashram now has a museum, the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalay. This had originally been located in Hridaya Kunj, Gandhi's own cottage in the ashram. You will definitely feel the calmness while visiting this place."
Truely Inspiring,"I wasn’t too sure what to expect on arrival but I was really impressed with both the numbers of people and the age range it seems that true inspiration is not bound by years. It’s difficult to explain exactly what it is , part museum , part exhibition, part school but all existing within an immensely peaceful area. I learned things on my visit not just about Gandhi’s life but how I approach things. It is not a place to timetable but rather one to savour and take the opportunity to reflect"
An abode of peace,"Sabarmati Ashram is a must-visit when one comes to Ahmedabad. Located on the banks of Sabarmati River, this Ashram gives a glimpse of the austere lifestyle of the great father of Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi. A number of activities were decided and executed by Mahatma along with his followers for the freedom struggle against the British at this place; and you feel connected with an important era of India's history. This Ashram was also showcased prominently in the Oscar winning film, Gandhi (of course, the Ashram was created and it was not shot here). Do visit here and you'll experience peace and harmony; also do not forget to buy some memorabilia like books, gifts, etc. from the shop located in the Ashram."
Peaceful and Relax able Place,This aashram is situated in outskirt of Ahmedabad in sabarmati. You can visit this for history of MG. He use to live here when he was alive. You can go there if you want to about him or just want to find peace.
Abode of the man who changed India's destiny forever ,"It is always an amazing experience to be at Gandhi Ashram...the place where Gandhiji once lived n lead the freedom struggle against the mighty British empire..Nested on the banks of Sabarmati River, it is a place where you would feel the tranquility n solace you are seeking for in life."
