Perfect summer beach,"We arrived in Benaulim in March, pre lockdown and are still here in July 2020. In March, several beach shacks were open, we were pleasantly surprised by the free beachbeds and towels, and the excellent food and drink services offered by polite staff in the shacks.  The beach itself was clean, gently shelving and the water was warm and clean. The only negative side still is, and was, the stray dogs. Far too many. Dog poo on the beach. Dogs fighting. Dogs begging for food at every shack. Once the season ends end of May, the shacks close and the dogs roam. The monsoon weather in June brings in an annual wash of oil, a result of tankers dumping the waste at sea and the tide pushing it up onto the beach. The high tides wash away the gentle sandy slopes and built up shack ""patio"" areas making it look so different during monsoon season. Debris is washed up regularly, washed away on the next tide, yet to see the beach being cleaned."
A lively beach which is also used by local fishermen,"This section of the beach has a large number of shacks, some watersports and local fishermen. As usual the beach is huge, sandy, gently shelving with a large tidal range.It is livelier than Sernabatim Beach (15 minute walk away) but not as boisterous as Colva Beach (35 minute walk), at least when we there in early March. There are probably enough shacks to last at least a fortnight were you to visit a different one eacy time.There are always lifeguards on patrol as the currents can get quite strong. In fact there is a lifeguard station there and we saw some recruits being trained (think Baywatch).As mentioned the local fishermen use this beach a lot and there are several fishing boats around. It's interesting watching them beach their boats and sell their catch directly on the beach."
Pure peace,"Head for this beach to get away from north GOA hustle-bustle. The main beach is approachable via the Benaulim town. I shall suggest to visit an even more relaxing part of the beach which is close to Taj exotica hotel, Benaulim and can be accessed by a road besides the hotel. This part of the beach has few decent shacks (Joecons beach shack has amazing food!), fine sand and a flat beach. This experience shouldn’t be missed .. !! Happy travelling"
Pristine beach,"I was simply amazed at the beaches this part of India has to offer, I mean specially the cleanliness....rather I should say, it's like visiting a inhabited beach, far away from human dwellings.... kudos to the Goan locals & the tourists that have being able to maintain year after years.....good white sand, lovely clean water....nice facilities, water sports, food shacks, lovely Goan seafood"
Beautiful beach with water sports acitivity,"Again, one of the clean beaches in south Goa. Even though it is crowded when compared to other south Goa beaches, but it is still clean. One can see many water sports and activities happening. Some nice shacks too are there on the beach. Must visit."
Lovely White sand beach with great sunsets ,"This beach is lovely. Clean white sand, much better than the black sand and dirty seas of North Goa.If you are looking for a quiet spot then this is the place for you as there is not much do. However there are plenty of cheap beach shacks offering great food.The sea has a little surf that you need to get past in order to swim but it is quite safe & there are lifeguards.I saw dolphins early one morning 😀"
Room to Roam,"I walked this beach for over 2 hours and found it to be uncrowded with an eclectic clientele.  While the sea was refreshing and the shore was easy to walk, you had to watch where you stepped in the dry sand due to the number of dogs that roam the area and do their business wherever they want.  There were many piles of dog excrement between the sea and beach shacks."
"Nice clean and quiet beach. Good shacks and the sea here is good to swim in, gentle enough for children and adults alike","Great beach in South Goa. Not too crowded, and a wonderful beach to lounge about at and the sea here is great for a splash or swim. Clean sands and clear waters in winter. Jan-Feb is a great time to be here."
Beach Benaulim,A white sand beach maintained very  The beach is maintained very clean . It's a long beach and is Ideal for long walks . Great sunset. It's very easy to walk down from the Karma Royal Palms resort . There are very nice restaurants right on the beach
Excellent clean beach,Great beach that is very clean. Those that leave a mess is generally picked up by cleaners patrolling the beach. Sea is nicely warm and refreshing and good sand underfoot. Very little seaweed.
Cool Morning beach Walk,Morning walk on the beach is really exhilarating and one should go there by 6.30 am. Cool breeze not much crowd at this time
Safe sandy beach suitable for children.,Nice flat sandy beach giving miles of promenades. I was here in February and the sea was always calm and the waves small. There are roaming lifeguards and flagged areas with a permanent presence.Wonderful place that I hope to get back to asap.
Beautiful,This is my first trip to goa and benaulim beach is one of the cleanest and huge beautiful beach in goa .great weather here and nice clean fresh air
Worst service,Worst service... They don't service Indian. Ment only for foreigners. The staff are disrespectful. I would recommend to boycott them.
Fabulous beach with lots of shacks to choose from ,"Beautiful beach. The sea is lovely and warm and there are lifeguards there to keep an eye on people, keeping everyone safe. Easy to get to by walking or jumping in a tuktuk."
A lovely beach,"The beach is very clean with lots of nice shacks for snacks, meals and cold drinks.  it is ideal for a day out in the Goa sun."
Best beach ever,Great shacks serving great foodRexs shack is our favourite the also cobi is delicious Very quiet beach
Very quiet and tranquil,The quiet side of Goa also great restaurants best restaurant in town is tansy on the Beach Road also and the most amazing breakfast and really good food in Dinas Beach Road also
19 klm of beach.,"The beach and sea are just stunning pure white sand and warm sea, can be a bit   choppy but part of the fun jumping the waves. pure delight."
Breathtaking,"Wonderful clean beach and very relaxing, lots of shacks serving good food and drinks at great prices"
Best beach,It's the most beautiful pleasant peaceful beach in goa no other beach can compete ultimate sea Waves very beautiful sea view ppl providing services here are also very cooperative and cool rates of water sports are lower than other crowdy beaches of goa like calangute baga etc.
"Great yoga, every day at 07:30 hrs",Above Pedro’s restaurant right on the beach there is ashtanga yoga- an excellent start to the day. I’m at novice but the teacher is so good and patient! And it’s only Rs.250 for 90 minutes. I really do recommend it.
One of the cleanest in Goa!,"Every morning, a walk along the kms of clean, sandy, gentle slope pristine beach was the best way to start our day in south Goa.  The water was just at the right temperature and lots of activity and people enjoying the beachside."
Lovely beach,A quite beach with a long stretch of beach front to walk. We walked approx 5 miles a time up to Varca beach.
Peaceful ,Peaceful beach. Not crowded at all. Visited this place during January end. Cool breeze and decent shacks.
Clean beach with many varied shacks,"This beach is long and straight with not much tree cover. On the day we  visited it was very busy, with most sunbeds occupied by Russian tourists, and the beach shacks well customised. A lot of the shacks have Russian menus and names like Sochi Beach. We enjoyed seeing the locals bringing down bulls to give them a very welcome cool down in the sea though the waves were choppy for swimming in. Not the most attractive beach, but one which is good for a day visit, and for trying out the really excellent beach restaurants which are located close to the car parking area, like Pedro's and Johncy's. These places had live music going on at the weekend, and the menus were excellent."
Oversubscribed,"I have nothing in Goa to compare with this beach however, it’s very clean but packed with Shacks and people, not the secluded paradise I expected."
Perfect `Photo Shoot` location.,The beach is fantastic ….. with plenty of beach bars to choose from & plenty to keep you interested/occupied as you wander.
Benaulim Beach Is Cool,"This is the cleanest and safestbeach that I have seen among theseven other beaches in India.  Blood-red sunsets, family groupswalking by night, soccer games, paragliding above the waves, friendlystray dogs and dancers create thisbeach."
Benaulim Beach to Benaulim Walk,"A pre-dawn, mostly street-lit, 2.5km walk on the paved roads between Benaulim Beach and Holy Trinity Church led to many encounters with packs of stray and set-loose dogs.   If walking alone, letting sleeping ones be, a walking stick and pepper spray helped to deter the dogs, while free-ranging cows, water buffaloes, and pigs were less aggressive when encountered.   Even small groups of walkers or runners seemed to have few difficulties.  Mosquito repellent was needed. Maria Hall and Kadar Supermarket are each roughly 1km from the Church and the Beach, respectively.   Produce, fresh fish, and ATMs are available at the Hall.   The Supermarket stocks most other necessities and close by are a chemist, the popular Hari’s German bakery/cafe, produce sellers, and a Kadar chicken shop. The holiday lights and decorations (photo of display across from Kadar supermarket attached) in Benaulim are plentiful and seemed more devotional and less commercial than in the West.  The 2.5 km walk can easily be extended another 15 minutes by continuing on in Benaulim to the also active and well attended St Sebastian’s."
Sandy beach,"Long clean sandy beach, lots of beach cafes with wide rage of food, refreshing cold drinks and free use of sunbeds and umbrellas. Lovely warm sea, safe bathing within lifeguard flags."
Nice n Clean Beautiful Long sandy Beach,It is a Nice Sandy Beautiful Beach. The Beach is very much Clean and  Nice beach. It is not so crowdie hence you can enjoy a lot . We stayed at the Joecons Beach resort which is close to beach almost 0.8 km aprox. but went in the morning and in the evening as well enjoyed at the Joecons shack. It has a lot of water sports activities .Although we did not took any water sports activity but you can enjoy a lot of water sports activity.
beautiful beach,a lovely beach near madgaon with less crowd. lots of good eateries at this beach. colva beach and trinity beach are nearby.
Beautiful,"Spent many wonderful days on this glorious beach in November 2019, will be returning in March 2020.. Try the Esco's Sunnmoon beach shack, you will not be dissapointed. Wonderful food there."
Nice beach,"It's a nice beach in South Goa.It's near to Colva beach, one can reach there easily by following Google map.I went there approx 6:30p.m. and it was good to visit there at this time to enjoy beach side dinner.Less crowded and fine beach."
Wonderful Beach of Goa,Enjoy the leisure time with your sweet heart. The local food is also good. Do not forget to apply Sunscreen lotion as it was too hot
Lovely benaulim,"Excellent, peaceful beach in South Central Goa, situated close to our resort Karma Royal Palms, Benaulim."
Beautiful and clean!,"Lovely, clean & uncrowded beach! It was wonderful to have direct access from the Taj Exotica and have such a peaceful atmosphere."
Excellent beach,Nice clean beach. Visited it on 21st December 2019. Less crowded nice and peaceful. Kids enjoyed the beach... had a nice dinner besides the sea. The most beautiful part was no hanky panky loud music soft live music was there and at the same time could enjoy the sound of waves at night a must visit till it gets more commercial and busy like baga and other beaches
Good beach for Dinner !,If you want to have dinner with a sea view restaurant. This beach is for you.A lot of restaurants on the beach.The parking area is also there.Found Water sports banner also there.Near by other beaches - Colva and Betal Batim
Beautiful,One of the best beaches we have been on. No sells. Pure serenity. Clean water with shells. Nice water activities.
Miles of sandy beach,"Benaulim is a quieter resort but still offers lots of restaurants and bars on the beach. Many provide sunbeds during the day.The sea can be treacherous as always on this coastline and the beach is well patrolled by lifeguards. The pale sand is a paradise for children. For walkers, it is an easy stroll along the beach to nearby Colva or the opposite direction to equally low key areas."
Lovely Clean Beach - Excellent Sunsets,Beach was clean with beautiful sunsets and nice restaurants and scenic views along the coast of South Goa. Water sports are available also
Lovely beach,Stayed only 2 minutes away from this lovely sandy beach. Can walk for miles either side of Benaulim beach. Shacks and restaurants a plenty. Sea safe to get in and out off.
Pristine Beach,"Definitely worth a visit! This beach looked exactly like the photos - stunning, clean and not crowded. There were plenty of restaurants and bars near by and the local people were super friendly."
Beautiful long beach,"Loved it here, you could walk for miles along the shoreline with beach shacks to get food and refreshments. Clean and lovely sand ."
A clean and peaceful beach in goa,"My family enjoyed the calm and cool ambience if the beach. The water sports activity is good for all. The place is good for elderly people and the peace loving visitors to Goa.Finally, it's one good beach to visit."
Fabulous!,"This beach on the Arabian Sea is spectacular. My wife and I walked about 10 km of the beach over eight days. Spotlessly clean with great beach food - we mainly ate at Rogers. The highlight was a candlelit dinner of freshly caught fish off the barbecue, with the Arabian Sea lapping two meters from our table. There are no pictures because none of my pics do it justice. If you want clean and uncrowded this is the beach. We will come here again."
Clean and not crowded,The beach is clean and also there is not much of crowd on the beach.. Few shacks around where u can hire the bed and relax.. Good experience overall..
Morning sunrise walk,Such beautiful clean beach. With the shakes on the beach. Lots of friendly dogs on the beach.Very peaceful in the early morning hours.Its differently a family friendly beach.Not too many water sports on the beach.
Delightful mix of Fisherman and Sun worshipping,"What a wonderful beach to just lay and watch the world go by, whether its the fishermans  dragging in the days haul or the bulls being walked there is always something happening."
Clean beach,"Benaulim beach is a lovely long beach to walk on or even swim in the water. The beach is very clean with some shacks which have decent food. This beach is very accessible , theres parking available and there are good restaurants like Pedro's just before getting onto the beach. It was enjoyable going to this beach for a walk daily."
Benaulim,The best thing about Benaulim is that it is peaceful and less crowded. It has a beauty of its own and is also known as the fisherman's coastline.
Great beach,"What a lovely area, good restaurants and bars along the beach. You can get free umbrellas and loungers which are comfortable. The Arabian Sea was lovely, great temperature, very salty so you can float nicely. A definite plus to the resort pool."
Very clean and Less crowded,"Less crowded beach, perfect for who want to go for quality beach and very delicious restaurants on beach side and evening time u can enjoy few  water sports"
Clean  beach,Very clean beachCould walk into  the beachThe view is Spectacular Could watch the Sunset so clearlyIt was such a wonderful sightThe crowd was also good
Great place to watch the sun go down.,We got a tuk tuk from the Royal Palms on a few occasions to watch the sun go down on the beach. A great place to sit with a drink and just people watch. A truly beautiful clean beach that will stay in my memory for a long time.
Superb Beach,I loved the Benaulim beach... Super clean and beautiful blue waters. Very limited number of shacks and restaurants located around the stretch but you can always expect good food...Love to visit again...
Serene Beach,"The best thing about this beach is that very few people visit it (except during sunset). It has 4 to 5 shacks (at least we found only these when we went) which are never too much crowded. We visited it both during daytime and night...each time we enjoyed different things. At night we went there for a drink and tried out the Southern Deck shack. The food and drinks were quite good and a bit cheaper than that of North Goa. The beautiful sea view, soothing sea breeze with the scotch and the tasty sea foods made this evening one of the highlights of our Goa trip. Also after leaving the shack we walked along the shore for sometime...enjoying the peacefulness and our favourite songs in our speaker. No one got disturbed by our music neither did any one come to disturb us. The next day we went back in the morning and trust me this time there were hardly 6 to 7 people in the entire beach...we being the only group of Indians amongst them. We went back to the same shack...ordered light drinks and some snacks.....and they allowed us to use their reclining chairs and shower rooms for free. Entire day was spent swimming in the waters and enjoying snacks and drinks in the shack. We returned finally in the evening after enjoying a Jet-ski ride and watching a beautiful sunset. The best thing about this beach is the serenity and lack of crowd however it does get crowded during sunset. Also I found the sea a bit rough, may be because Goa just suffered the tantrums of a cyclone the week before we visited."
Benaullim beach,"Scenic beautiful, played in the glittering waves, swimming & deeping , enjoyed Sandy sea shore, sunbathing valued"
"Nice, worth visiting","We made a trip to Benaulim Beach during our stay at Candolim. Beach was clean. We were here in the morning. We were able to see fishermen coming back from the sea. Less visited as compared to north Goa beaches, this makes it better, cleaner and enjoyable. It has a lot of water sports activities. There are a lot of shacks for people to eat or drink and they do relax for long time. The beach and the water is clean. It is easily accessible."
Best spot for peace and tranquility. ,"If you’re looking for peace of mind and tranquility , this is the beach you’ve got to go. It’s got very few shacks but that’s what makes this beach less commercial and lesser noisy and low on the kind of crowd we wanted to avoid in Goa."
Superb,"Superb n clean. Very good restaurants/shacks that offer great food, drinks, music & service. Amazing sunset every evening."
Nice beach. ,Very clean. Nice beach. Not very crowded.only problem this time when we went there was cyclone warning.
Shiva,"Look out for an amazing man called Shiva. He runs tours and gets involved in many other tourist activities. We did a cooking workshop at his house. It was such an interesting experience. Shiva speaks 20 languages, knows everything about world politics / sports etc. A very kind and genuine character who will make your stay memorable."
Family reunion ,Excellent facility! Beautiful beaches! Amit  and the rest of the restaurant staff provided outstanding services. Customizable foods and dietary needs met well throughout the stay. Pool and entire complex pristine clean. Children friendly.Definitely ‘a go back to place.’
clean beach,clean beach .good for after lunch relaxation .we can enjoy the cool blue waters and scenic sunset . we enjoyed a lot  with children as well.
Lovely,"One of the lovelier beaches in this part of Goa. Quiet in early October, but there are actually open shacks, like Blue Corner."
BEST BEACH on Holidays,"It is the best cleanest and longest beach, I have come across. Being not crowded, sun rise and sun set photography was par excellance and added to my son's birthday photoshoots. Recommended location."
The dirtiest beach I could see in my entire Goa tour,"One of the pathetic beaches I witnessed. There were a lot of animal droppings around. Though there were people cleaning the beach premises, I believe they are confined only to a stretch as I could see not everything is cleaned."
Very Clean Beach.,The Beach is clean and not to crowded.Ample free parking place available adjoining the Beach.Snacks are available in the parking area.
Peaceful !!,1.Nice and clean stretches of sand on both sides2. Water is inviting...no danger3. In off season.....so no beach shacks this time....only a couple of these were there4. Too much dogs on the beach...not disturbing but not a pleasant site though.5.For couples and families with small kids definitely worth to visit
beautiful,The beach is really beautiful with limited people Loved the beach golden sand  Nice restaurant present at the beach.
"Nice beach, with issues","A fairly nice beach, long sandy strip, a gentle graduation from shore to at least 50 metres out allows plenty of space to splash around etc; apparently there's quite strong currents a little further out and the lifeguards patrolling were quick on the whistle if they thought you were too far out.The negatives, dogs roaming around, obviously strays, a little worrying for some people and the beach touts, when we were there (mid September) there weren't too many people about so anytime we appeared they swarmed us and would not take a gentle hint or even a direct refusal. It happens most places but still annoying."
joncy,"jouncy is the best part of this beach, good food and service and reasonably priced drinks the beach here is not overcrowded and with a good variety of restaurants/shacks"
Beautifully clean beach.,"We spent a week here and most days we walked up and down the beach and stopped in at the restaurants and bars.  Despite it being the wind down of the tourist season, the atmosphere was pretty good with a few bars offering free entertainment.  We sampled drinks and food most places and had a few favourites that we kept returning to.  At sundown the amount of locals who flocked to the shore was crazy.   Couples, children, elderly, families all in beautiful brightly coloured clothes splashed around in the sea and had little picnics on the sand.  I loved this place and felt very safe at all times and I would definitely spend my time here again."
Good looking,The place is very good and has a good look.It is very nice and can spend a good time.It is very beautiful and nice place.
Cleanest,"Well people say about clean beach, I found this as one of the cleanest and white sand beach in the south Goa. Less crowded= more peaceful"
smooth sandy beach,probably the cleanest beach in goa with a lot of 4 and 5 star properties there. the hotels also take good care in cleaning them. Could walk easily without footwear.
Beautiful in Monsoon,"Probably it's the season or just our luck that the beach was relatively vacant in the last week of June. There were no suffocating crowds, no boisterous tourists hogging the beach.What we got was clean, virgin sands with solitude. The only voice was of the waves, strengthened by rains, hitting the shore.The rainy season also meant that most of the shacks were shut. Just 2-3 were open including Johncy and Rafael's. Enough for us.A big takeaway for us... visit Goa in the offseason. Less crowds and more space for you."
Clean and Serene,"Simply beautiful! With only two families on the beach the Benaulim beach is a great spot to enjoy the ocean (Arabian Sea). However, May to September are not the months to explore the ocean as Goa mostly sees higher tides and stronger winds. This thankfully does keep a lot of tourists away. Benaulim beach had 3 points of entry around the Trinity area. Entry 1: can be accessed from the southern tip. If you stand facing the ocean (which you won't really see - but imagine you are facing it) when at the trinity church, the road on your left will take you there. It is also easier to spot it as the Taj is located around there. There are no shacks, there no human in sight. Making it the most uninhabited spot. But due to the Taj, people do use the beach a lot from time to time.Entry 2: If you drive down directly via the trinity church, you will find the best spot to the beach. There are very few shacks, as a result very few or no tourists. Making it the best spot. Entry 3: If you go via, the Maria Hall, you get a few more shacks, along with Jauncy's, best known for its Goan and Sea food Cuisines. Don't ask for sandwiches and all, they will either take forever or keep getting it wrong."
Beautiful beach.. one of the best in Goa,We visited in June so the shacks were all closed and beach beds removed. It may have been better with the same however the beach was beautiful as ever.The gradient is low and waves comfortable to swim in.
Clean Beach with water sports,Very nice and clean beach ...its well maintained also water sports facility is there too..love to visit again ..
Clean Beach,Have a facility of water sports games. Privately maintained beach. Very clean. Have beach chairs to relax.
Awesome beach to leisure,like to visit again for leisure time in the season of summer.... next year dam sure to visit again...
Beach,"Benaulim beach is very near from this TREEHOUSE RESORT , it is just walking distance 1.9 KM, Sunset was mesmarizing!!!!"
"Love the beach, its virgin and secluded",Love the vibes here. Not too crowded. There are not a lot of shacks here but is a good place to chill.
Beach with Difference ,"This beach is different from any other beach in GOA , neat & Clean , cool & calm. Enjoy the beach with family and friends. Even for couple it’s romantic beach."
Amazing Beach - No Litter,"Our first beach in South Goa. Very long, we walked 2 hrs in each direction and didn’t touch a fraction of this section of coast.Some beach shacks still opened (late May).  Perfect for kids, huge stretch of white sand with very long shallow lead in to water. Gets a bit rough to swim in but waves looked like fun.  Toddlers would love the 10m or so lead up to waves (ankle deep) of damp sand with gentle water lapping it.  Lifeguards regularly placed.Dogs can be a bit of an issue. Single dogs I can ignore but when they packed I panicked. They tend to have their own ‘shack’ areas, so just keep walking and they eventually turn back."
Not as clean as we expected ,"Lovely white sands with plenty of length to take a nice stroll in the morning & evening. Only down side was there were stray dogs on the beach which inevitably have to go to the toilet & nobody to clean up their poo, broken glass in places & some spots the water was a strange brownish/ green colour with foam on it"
Clean and safe beach,"Benaulim beach during the day is really nice. Once can hang out at the shacks like Roger's and Johncy's the entire day and also swim whenever you feel like it. It starts to get crowded around 5:30/6 in the evening for sunset. But still a great beach for kids, pets, family and solo travelers."
"White sands, not too crowded, good eating options.",We've been going to this beach since we were kids and now we take our kids here. It's gotten a little too touristy in the recent past and hence I give it only 4 stars.
Serene ,Calm & less crowded beach!!! Must visit for morning walk and evening strolling!! Good breeze on the beach. Most recommend place to visit in South Goa.
Excellent and clean,Its a white sand beach in south goa. Few shacks available to chill around. If you want peace and want to spend time without disturbance then go for it.
Scenic!,Less crowded than the beaches in North Goa. Very nice and calm atmosphere. There are a few shacks available where you can relax and enjoy the sea breaze with a drink and a snack. Water sports is available which is slightly expensive than the ones in North Goa.
Calm and clean area,This is in south goa and with decent crowd. Beach is clean and you can relax here for long time with good shacks around to have food and drinks.Not much of water sport but really calm and senic place.
quite a gud beach,this beach is quite clean with a lot of shacks. the johncy shack right besides the car parking is quite good
Fantastic beach,Spending our days walking up and down the many beach shacks for food and amazing food made our trip one we will never forget. We came in late April so the beach is quieter than normal but in an evening that’s when it comes more to life with families playing in the sea or having a game of football. A fantastic place!!!
Beautiful palm fringed beach,"Clean, white gold sands. Dotted with fishing boats and fringed with palm trees. Thankfully not too many beach cafes and sunloungers. The sea is as clean and fresh as the beach. A lovely spot!"
Holiday in Goa,We had our holiday on this beautiful beach and sand is like icing sugar so soft just beautiful and the water so warm it was like having a bath in the sea
Beautiful and clean beach !,"Beautiful beach which has less crowd and a great expanse to walk along. Parking becomes an issue on certain days specially weekends. Great eating out options including Rogers, Southern Deck,etc."
"Nice, worth a visit",We made a trip to Benaulim Beach during our stay at Cavelossim. Beach was clean. We were here in the morning. We were able to see fishermen in action coming back from the sea.
Less visited makes it better,"Less visited as compared to north goa beaches, htis makes it better, cleaner and enjoyable.It has a lot of water sports activities.There are a lot of shacks for people to eat or drink and relax.The beach and the water is clean.It is easily accessible."
Good to visit,South Goa beaches are relatively quieter compared to their northern counterparts. This is no exception. But lot of fishermen around with their boats. Fewer options to eat compared to Palolem.
Very nice,We loved this beach.Very near to parking place .Many beach shacks are here.You can get veggies also.Small shops are there.I love the crafts items.Bus transport there but Evening I don't know.In evening throughout the beach I love the candle table s.Benaulim  is  close to Colva.Totally different n beautiful.
Benaulim beach,Benaulim beach is in South Goa between Colva & Varca. It is a beautiful beach with soft sand and clear waters. During the tourist season there are quite a few shacks to provide for your comfort. Food is generally good & fresh. This season in particular there has been a lot of stray dogs in the area. Apart from that the beach is lovely.
"Great beach,","The beach is one of the cleanest in Goa, the pride that the shacks have for there own area is good,  long beach for walking"
Serene,"Most serene beaches of goa. Extremely clean . A must for relaxing holidays . Its what people come to south goa for , unlike north which is filled with shacks and garbage on the beach and loud music."
Heaven ,"This is paradise Heaven so relaxing, lots of beach shacks selling great food. Sea is safe with lifeguards on the beach. Love sitting watching the sun set"
Must Visit,"A must place to visit in South Goa. The beach is so mesmerising & beautiful that you could spend hours enjoying thr view. Water sports too are available like Parasailing, banana ride, jet ski etc. You can have bargaining in rates of water sports. No public toilets are available on beach. But you have to ask restaurants to use theirs."
Lovely Family Beach,"One of the best longest beaches in south Goa. Enjoyed the scenes Fishermen boats with their daily catch. So soothingbto the eyes. Long walks on clean beach for the entire week was a bonus with Boat,  Banana and Jet Sky rides at Pele's Sports"
Holiday,Excellent  all good enjoyed a lot and next time i will visit with my family.  Nikita and pinak was really helpful.
Clean Beach,one of the easily accessible beaches in south goa. Its nice and clean like other beaches in south goa. Nice shacks around for some good food
Nice Beach in South Goa,"Nice quite clean white sand beach in South Goa. Medium-Low surf, shallow entry, so fairly kid-friendly. Plenty of beach shacks; they will let you park yourself/stuff on their chaise lounges with umbrellas if you buy drinks/food. Beach is safe at night to walk to/from beach shacks for dinner; lots of stray dogs, but they typically won't bother you. Ate at a number of shacks, pretty high quality throughout, best meals were at Joecons, Mahal, People, Blue Corner. Stayed at Beira Mar, which has good beach access and is close to Benaulim Beach Road, which you can take into the closest town (10-15 min. walk) that has shops for groceries, water, booze, food, ATMs (recommend Bank of Boroda, on main road, go to ATM on far right for Cirrus withdrawls). Handicrafts and jewellery were overpriced, so save your shopping for the big cities, if possible. Overall, this place best for a relaxed stay; if you want to party all night, go elsewhere."
Beautiful Benaulim!!,"Another beautiful beach of North Goa. Relatively less crowded ,life can be so peaceful here. Just park yourself in one of the shacks and read a book, paint, talk ,take an occasional dip or simply do nothing...we deserve it!!"
Very pleasant,"lesser crowd than north guys.. South Goa rocks. Don't know why people head north, it is crowded dirty. visit benaulim"
Foreigners most liked beach,Since it is away from roadside and local crowd is minimum this beach is thronged by foreigners.  A real experience to walk through the lengthy Calm and quiet beach side.  One could gaze at foreign nationals  taking sun bath and sea bath & sea surfing undertaken by experts.
What a fabulous beach,"This is as idyllic a beach as I have seen anywhere in the world. Wonderful sands, firm below the high water mark. No shingle. There are many beach shacks to eat in , water sport outlets and such like but these in no way detract from this beautiful place.  Bars will let you have a sun bed for the price of a drink- a 650 ml bottle of Kingfisher beer typically costing Rs 100- just over GBP1.  There is the occasional salesman but they are good humoured and a minor irritation at worst. Early March was just gorgeous weather wise - low 30’s with a gentle breeze to keep one very comfortable . Swimming is possible though currents are not insignificant. Water temperature though is divine.  Can’t wait to be back."
Well worth the walk,"I believe the Varca beach blend into the Benaulim Beach . A beautful stretch of stand for miles and miles ,. A number of beach shacks hardly any people Beautiful"
Very nice,Miles of unspoiled beach with beach shack restaurants dotted along.  Comfortable chaises and umbrellas are available.
Beauty,"The beach is so clean and flat plenty of sunbeds and sellers selling their goods a polite no works, they have bicycles to hire jetskis and paragliding. Joecons beach shack was a definate yes to visit beautiful food and a nice welcome"
Peaceful,"Lovely beach with a few beach shacks.  Warm Arabian sea and a few stray dogs, but they do not bother you at all."
Clean beach living up to reputation,beautiful beach dotted with Goan wooden fishing boats with plenty of well rated food shacks . A lot of stray dogs but all seem clean and non threatening in day light. Life guard areas clearly marked but swimming unsafe during monsoon season.
Our favourite beach!,"Beautiful beach with sparkling, fine white sand and wide open space. The sea shelves gently and even though some of the waves can be a bit strong they’re not vicious. The beach is clean with a few scattered shacks about, not crowded at all. Definitely our favourite beach in Goa so far."
Lovely clean beach,Lovely clean sandy beach with a few beach shacks. Always a few waves coming in but you can still swim. Life guards along the beach. Main problem is the women selling jewellery and clothes and the beggars but just have to be firm with them. Water sports available.
Beautiful beach with less crowd!,Very neat and beautiful beach with less crowd. Peaceful and less of noise of the hawkers going around. Water sports facilities are also available. Few shacks with good snack options and had decent toilet facilities and good sunbeds. Its peaceful to just sit and look at the fishermen arrive with their fresh catch and go on with their activity.
Excellent beach ,Loved the beach which was cleaned regularly The shacks we visited were great with good toilet facilities
Enjoy real natural beach beauty,I have visited almost all beaches of Goa but this time I enjoyed Benaulim beach which is beyond to describe in words but it needs to be experienced. Very net and clean beach with disciplined crowed having all water sports facilities still look like a virgin beach.
Lovely beach,"We were they today, we went to Little Tiger, good sunbeds, friendly service, clean toilets and our lunch was great, we had Chicken Tikka in Nam Bread Pockets we shared and I am glad we did because it was really large. They were a few sellers about but they didn’t give to much hassle. On the way out of the beach we bought prawns from the fishermen, must be fresh as the boat had just come in. It was a good day and we will go again."
All very close together,"Monday evening 4th March and we were at Benaulim Beach for the first time as we were visiting Johncys restaurant for dinner.The beach is situated along the South Goan coast and is betweem Sernabatim and Varca beachs.When we arrived at the beach, by taxi, we pulled up in front of Pedro's restaurant /bar, it was all a bit congested with cars, taxi's, tuk tuks and people milling around.As it was the first time here, took the opportunity to have a quick stroll along the beach. The white sand was clean and soft underfoot.On the beach there was a large number of brightly painted fishing boats resting up on the sand, they were so close there was not much beach left.Even though it was dark there were still beach sellers working on the beach and weaving through the restaurants' beach seating, surprisingly they came in to the resturant we were in.It appeared that the restaurant/bars we on top of each other, on one side there was Pedro's, nextdoor Johncys the Rogers and on and on.It all felt a bit claustrophobic, everything so squeezed in and close to and on top of each other.In fairness it might be completely different during the day and that might be the best time to visit."
clean and green,the very best of unexplored beaches in Goa and a vacation far away from the hustle of main land Goa.
Fabulous!,Miles and miles of sand with good beach shacks with free use of loungers if purchasing food or drink.
Relaxing Beach,"Benaulim beach is one of the best beach in goa.It is not crowded,clean and It is good beach for relaxing and spend time.when you visit this beach you can find many International tourist relaxing and enjoying their time."
Never going North again !!!,"This was our first visit to the South of Goa, what a difference!!!Far nicer than Candolim, not so busy and the beach and sea much quieter. Loved every minute and will be going back!!!!"
Valonias Beach Shack,"Great food, caters for all with a very friendly staff. The walks along the beach are idyllic for a romantic stroll. Watch out for the dolphins and wild life."
Beautiful beach,"We love this beach! Beautiful, not too crowded and great waves. Strong currents though, so be careful..."
I would Highly Recommend!,"These beaches go on for miles, kept immaculate, & lots of shacks to stop & have a drink or two, which you will definitely need. There are dogs everywhere, but they don't bother you at all, they're there to try & stay out the sun & at evening they sleep in the shacks under the tables, The water is gorgeous, I loved it but you can see all the plastic & rubbish being washed up, they have people going up & down the beaches clearing it up, you never get sick of the view, for chill & relaxation it's a definite!"
"Very very nice place,","The place is very very beautiful , and nice . comfortable  for everybody for couple, family, friends etc, most clean beach with testy food available and sand quality is superb mostly white"
"Clean, less crowded beach","One of the best beaches in Goa. Much less crowded. Clean. Morning or night, we spent a lot of time there during out stay in south Goa. There is parking space available, although limited."
One of the world's best beaches,"A superb and very clean beach. Just lovely to walk along for miles. No high rise buildings, just natural. Beautiful sand, and so soft and then firm by the waters edge (vehicles can easily drive along). In the afternoon see the local fishing boats bring in and unload their catch."
Relaxing and clean,We spent 4 nights in Benaulim and literally spent at least four hours each day laying down the glorious sun while reading books in peace. The beach front shacks are good for drinks (food is a bit pricey) and their toilet facilities are surprisingly clean. We would 100% return here.
Great beach,Was there for three weeks over Jan-Feb great place great sea lots to do or just chill would recommend
Let the sun kiss your soul,Let the Sea and the Sun kiss your soul as you stroll on the soaked sands by the azure waters.  The beach is clean n really beautiful. Manned by coast guards who instruct you when n where to swim. Also has a lot of water sports. Shacks provide great feni and a vast menu of unforgettable sea food
Clean and fascinating beach for relaxing,"Beach with full of shacks operational for late hours with wide choice of liquors, cocktails and food"
Promotional offer,Excellent offer. Karma Royal Palm resort is situated near Benaulim Beach and I will rate this beach as second most beautiful beach of Goa after Palolem Beach
Clean,Thank you benaulim for a beach so clean and proper. Except for a madman who was line fishing and barked like a dog the people are warm
Quiet,lovely and relaxing. Not a smoker but the Tourist Police  do give out fines if seen on beach. very pretty.
Clear seas and fine sand,Large beach with all facilities spectacular views and whether it’s water sport or fishing it is there best just to relax
Very clean,One of the best part is that the beach is very clean. People are helpful and not crowded. Best to vacate for couples
Beautiful place to enjoy the Goa,"5 minutes walk from La Grace Resort, the beach is clean and patronised by locals and tourists. We all really enjoyed the beach, very chilled, no hassle . Only we got lots of love from local people..     The place is refreshing, everything clean and beautifully decorated. The hosts were very welcoming and an evening at a restaurant where live music performance was great fun.  Definitely we will be back soon in Goa and to choose same beach .."
Best beach of Goa,"One of the clean beaches very close to ROYAL Palms,  10-12 minutes walk. Nice food joints for non vegetarians , good place for peaceful not much crowded beach."
The best beach in Goa,"Acres of immaculately clean beach, warm water, bright blue skies and the best beach shacks (led by Joecons) all providing brilliant food, free sunbeds and silly low prices. What more do you want?"
Stunning,Clean lots of space the odd beach dog you can walk for miles one of the best we’ve seen. Lots and lots of cheap beach shacks to cool off at.
"Excellent for Chilling, Relax and Walk ","Great Beach on south of Beach (particularity the best one). Here you can sit on the beach chairs, have beers and food all day for a fair price. Very relaxing.Only suggestion would be about increase incentives for people not leave trash on the sand by adding more trash bins around."
One of less crowded and long beaches,"This beach is in South Goa near Margao/Varca. There are many hotels in the vicinity and if you are staying in one of those, then this is a must visit place. Its relatively clean and less crowded as compared to some famous beaches in north."
Down by the sea,"More crowded than it once used to be, Benaulim beach is still a lovely place to visit and enjoy a sunset. Lots of shacks on the beach with live music or other activities in most of them."
Beach,Beautiful beaches. Cant say a thing wrong.Joecons Beach shack staff were rude and no help. We asked about the sun lounges and got . DONT HAVE  ANY.
miles of sand- great for cycling,plenty of room for everyone. great places to eat and drink.tried a new place everyday and all served great food. Hired bicycles for a whole day for around £4 for 2-what a bargain.Great to watch the fishermen come back in and help pull up the boats and watch the catch be unloaded.Lots of dogs but they didn't seem aggressive.
Beautiful beach ,Beautiful and a very clean beach . Also the shacks have very good food. Definitely recommended for sunset and sunrise view.
Excellent beach,"Just 2 km away from Colva (Goa), Benaulim Beach is one of the ideal locations for the tourists seeking for serenity and tranquillity. Though, the beach is famous for fishing, it is still unexplored by travelers. A long stretch of empty sand, showered with laid-back and windswept, this beach is a great place to relax on the sands, with abundance of sunbed-equipped beach shacks tracing the stretch to the north. The place has brilliant scenic beauty and the architectural grandeurs of its churches, old houses, and temples; simply become the famous attractions of Benaulim. It's one of the evergreen destinations of Goa, which is also popular as heaven for tourists."
Particularly nice a way from the main town beach area,2 mins walk a way from the main town beach area - tranquil and picture postcard perfect with shady beach shacks and sun bed that they allow you to use free providing you spend a few rupees
Peaceful Serene and Rejuvenating,"Staying very close to the Benaulim Beach, we walk down every evening around 5.30 pm and return after Sunset..the beach is vast and infinite, so one can find one's own space..the walk is very refreshing as you see young children creating their own art with sand, some boating, few flying kites, youngsters playing frisbee and lazy and hungry people indulging in crabs & prawns..the Sunset is Beautiful and mesmerizing"
"Beautiful beach, warm water, pleny of day beds and beach shacks to enjoy.","We spent a week staying near Benaulim Beach - swam and lazed around most days, the Beach is great, stretches for many km in each direction - lovey casual beach shack dining.  January (winter) is a great time to be there, with daily temperature around 30 celsius and no humidity. Food, drinks, transport all very cheap - a very restful and interesting time all told."
Calm and serene beach,"I visited this beach with a bunch of friends and had a nice time. Though the only mistake we made was going in the afternoon when it's extremely hot. Try going late in the afternoon and you could enjoy a dip in the beach, play football with the local boys and sip some margaritas in any of the shacks. This beach is predominantly occupied by foreigners, especially Russians."
Best beach in South Goa,Love this beach . So peaceful and some great shacks to eat at .can't wait to go back. Just watch out for the purple jelly fish.
Great beach ,I came to this beach recently while my stay at Azaya  resort. Such a clean beach I must say with clean water and awesome white sand. I recommend to enjoy this beach once.
Beautiful beach,First of all about benaulim beach is very beautiful and clean with many different types of things including beachshakes with many different types of food and live music almost every evening. Surrounded with nature and hassle free.
walk for ever,"beautiful beach,you can walk for miles stopping for a drink in one of the beach shacks or hire a bike and peddle along the shore line."
"Silent Beach, Not much action","I went to benaulim beach along with wife and my son, this beach is very silent with less crowd and activities,You will find few foreigners relaxing and taking sun bath.The shacks are also not happening like other beaches.You may find it little boring after if you like music,good crowd etc"
Beautiful beach,"Very quiet and relaxing! Beautiful warm sea with good waves. Find the shack called ‘people’ for great food, service and my favourite beach dog..Dinner!"
Beautiful Sandy Beach,The Beach stretches for miles and the Arabian Sea very pleasant to swim in.Numerous beach shacks offer inexpensive food and drink.
Clean and Tranquil,"Stayed two weeks at a resort about a kilometre away and walked down and back nearly every day.  White sand that squeaks between your toes, a beach that is cleaned regularly, no rubbish in the water and plenty of beach shack restaurants that put out free sun lounges and umbrellas and don't hassle you.  It's interesting watching the fishing boats coming and going and there are water sports for the more adventurous.  Great in the evening too.  Perfect for a walk and to watch the sunset.  Not a party beach - much more a family beach."
Feel beautiful white sand,Benaulim beach is very clean and less crowded. It’s white sand and safe beach is place to feel! Only the no of shacks are less and for party people it’s not the place to visit at all
Tranquility !,One of the best and decent beaches in south goa with white sands and beach front Restaurants. Must visit.
"Safe, Clean, white sand, clear water, with good shacks and also water sports","This beach was one of the nicest beaches I visited when I travelled solo to Goa. It’s got a very peaceful vibe to it. Nice shacks. Not too over crowded. Really good people offering both free use of shacks as well as good water sport service. It was a beautiful beach to swim in. And the water was clear and perfect for a swim. It’s in south Goa, but not too south. So it’s in a perfect location as well if one is traveling from north goa. I liked the Parola’s shack. There is a coast guard as well. ."
Lovely clean beach,"Lovely clean beach, with loads of beach shacks to choose from for food and drinks. You can walk for miles, the beach is 29km long!"
Lovely beach,"Miles of white sand, clean and uncrowded. What's not to like? The  sea was lovely to swim in. you could walk out a long way without it getting too deap. It was like stepping into a warm bath."
Heaven,"You just fall in love with this beach. After a gap of a couple of years we returned. We were nervous that it would not be as fabulous as we remembered.  We need not have worried. The sea is bath warm. The sound of the waves so relaxing. Lots of wonderful wave action, people watching and animal life. The shacks provide sun umbrellas and comfortable beds along with wonderful food and drinks. Our favourite, along with a lot of other people, is Joe Cons."
Clean & not crowded,"This is one of the cleanest & least crowded beaches that I saw in Goa.We visited it in the morning, afternoon as well as in the evening & found mainly the local crowd that loves to sit & chat along the beach.There are good restaurants on this beach & the food & drink is awesome"
Beach,"Long, sandy, safe to walk, swim with caution if not strong swimmer, there are lots of lifeguards, get the dolphin boat its a wonderful boat trip, lots of shacks for lunch, Zumbrai our favourite."
Christmas on the beach,stunning beach .miles and miles  of white sand .great beach shacks are good . sea with nice big waves
Lovely stretch of beach but not much vibe ,Benaulim is a lovely long stretch of beach and I spent one morning walking down to Varca and up to Colva. Not a great deal going on and in my view lacks a little soul. A few bars do Karaoke at night so if that’s not your thing then avoid at all costs. Best beach spot for the day for me was up nearer Colva where it was a bit quieter.  But then most of the beach is pretty quiet.Restaurants all much the same. Don’t think I’ll rush back on my next visit!
Always something to see!,"A beautifully clean beach with plenty of space and lots of choices of sunbeds/umbrellas provided by the beach shacks, if you do not want to lie on the sand. Used by locals as well as tourists and  with fishing boats arriving at low water, local people guiding their water buffalo or brahmin bulls along the sands  as a short cut to the next pasture along and friendly beach sellers who do not make a nuisance of themselves it is certainly a beach to visit. Beach shacks have toilets and handwash facilities, as well as excellent food, life guards are a recent addition and the water is warm and clean. Swimming is generally safe, juts be aware that the waves can be lively when it is windy."
Superb place,"We were staying near Colva beach but opted to walk along the beach (20 mins) to be at this place.  Clean, quieter and away from hustle and bustle of Colva beach.You can taxi if you don't like walking."
 Beautiful & clean,We chose to stay near this beach because our friend stays here every year. The beach and the water are clean and it is a perfect place to watch sunsets. There are many restaurants to choose from to have meals.
Beautiful beach to relax,"Clean beach, safe to swim. Also safe to leave your things to the beach while going to swim. Not too crowded but not lonely. Both foreign and domestic tourists. Good food and service at the beach shacks. Rentfree sunbeds and shades when you order some drinks or food."
A beautiful clean beach,"We walked for miles on this lovely beach, it is clean and the shack people call you in but are not any bother. If you want a drink or food you are then able to use the sun beds for as long as you want for free. There are interesting things going on all the time like water buffalo going for a walk and dip in the sea! Fishermen with their catch or mending nets and people who just want to talk to you. It is wonderful and the sunsets are beautiful. Goa is a very friendly place and the food is very tasty and varied."
Walk ten minutes to your right as you face the sea,"Okay our hotel went onto the beach ten minutes away from Benaulim Beach,do yourself a favour and wander up.Less shacks,food smells,people. Peace lots ....."
Peaceful!,"We used the section of beach in front of Joecons Shack. Clean, relaxing and comfortable. The beds with the green umbrellas providing the better shade. There are 4 shacks close by. A lady cleans the beach every morning. The toilet beside the lifeguard station was 1 of the best on the beach providing soap and towels, was also cleaned. We walked the full length of the beach, over 16 miles, and taking all factors into account concluded this little section was 1 of the best!"
"Beautifully clean beach, water and air! ","Pictures were taken at low tide. This beach is very, very clean and populated by visitors in Goa for the warmth, escaping the harsh European winters. There are lifeguards on duty and as you can see, a red flag denotes the Arabian Sea is innocent enough looking but dangerous. We have visited several times and plan to stay in one of the beach huts for a few days in January. The water was pleasant and not cold. There are water sports are for entertaining the adventurous but we sat in the shade of a covered restaurant, sipping cool beverages and enjoying the afternoon breeze. The beach is all but devoid of shells. Sorry beachcombers."
"We stayed in Carina Beach Resort in Benaulim, Goa",Wonderful experience a home away from home.Ms.Nisa n Ms Naisa were very sweet n helpful.the hotel vehicle and driver was also very well aware of routes n a good guide.the resort has a good ambience.
Nice 🏖 clean ,"Nice, nice shacks, can see the fishermen bting in there catch, you can can even help them pull the boats onto the beach if you feel inclined to do so."
Fantastic beach,"A quiet area , fantastic sand ,very clean . There are a number of places to eat on the beach . You can also get sun beds and umbrellas for free , you just have lunch in the shack or drinks etc"
White Sand and Relaxed Beach,"Just spent a week there. Walked miles every day and tried a couple of places as a day relaxation.Beds comfort varies ,so is the service of people who will look after you for the day.We were very happy there.Good for families and people who seek rest and hassle free life, although there are a lot of sellers on the beach, but you can ignore them."
Quiet Beach,I think it is one of the better beaches for an evening out as it is not so crowded and has a good choice of shacks to sit and relax after a swim or walk.
Cleanest beach in south Goa !,"Definitely one of the cleanest beaches in south Goa. Soft sand, gentle waves, starfish and crabs for company !"
visit to bogmalo beach at noon,v good restaurants and shacks on the beach v clean beach definitely worth a visit even at noon there was cool breeze and plenty of sun umbrellas 
Wallace chambers ,Great beach plenty of sunbeds.  Just be careful in the as tide is a bit strong.  There is a life hard patrolling the beach 
Lovely beach!,"A lovely strip of beach, away from the busy. Great shacks to eat and drink at, and in the morning and evenings, you get to see the fisherman bring in the fish. A great area!"
Beautiful beach,The beach is one of the cleanest beaches you can find in Goa. Not much crowded and is frequented by international travellers. There are lot of shacks to enjoy the evening near the sea. In morning you can catch up local fishermen selling fresh catch of the day.
Paradise!,"This is our favourite beach.  While one end has all the hustle and bustle, the other end is lovely and peaceful, so you have the choice.  We prefer the quiet, so we stay towards Joecons end.  We eat all our food at Seafood point, which has fantastic friendly staff and we love their food."
The quiet and soothing Benaulim Beach,Benaulim Beach starts from the ending point of Colva Beach and is among the quietest beaches of Goa. The Benaulim Beach is normally crowded during weekends and during the evenings. It is highly preferred as a result of the excellent climatic conditions offered by it. There are a couple of hotels in Benaulim Beach that are good enough for purposes of accommodation. The shack cafes at the beachfront are the best places to eat.
Amazing clean beach,Not crowded specially the stretch near Taj exotica; visit at different times for different experiences. Awesome sunset. Great shacks. The side near Royal Palms is crowded but good for a one time visit. Pedros is great food and the terrace view is awesome at dusk.
Beautiful beach!,"A beautiful beach you can walk for miles,there are beach shacks to call in for refreshing drinks,sun beds to lie on if that's what you like and above all very clean."
Amazing place to have a relaxing evening ,"Benaulim beach is a pretty relaxing place, with a lot to do and amazing options for every one, from  street food to relaxing beach front restaurants and even some pub-like options"
Less busy beach,Nice beach clean and less busy than some also less sellers to hassle you .Great place to relax and enjoy the sun and local food
Hell of a Beach!,"What can you say, sand, sea and blue skies.The beach is clean, good lifeguard coverage and a plethora of Beach Shacks to drink and dine at."
Beautiful Warm Sea-Stunning Beach,"Absolutely beautiful beach, miles of pure Golden Sand. Sea is warm..and I mean warm. Beautiful shacks, all good offering cheap good food, and drinks. Quite a lot of stray dogs, but all the shacks seem to feed them. They're not dangerous, and I've been giving them biscuits. Some dogs seem to have their own territory, but they haven't caused us any problems. Idyllic :)"
Big Bit of Sand,Full of beach shacks providing quality food and free sun lounger. Lots of dogs lying around but they tend to ignore. A good place to soak up the rays.
White sandy beach. Warm sea. ,"Benaulim is a nice beach, great for swimming, and the beach shacks serve nice food and cold drinks, beer and even wine. ."
Miles of white sand and warm sea ,Lovely beach to walk along watching the sunset. Pleantly of water spots and the sea is beautifully warm. Nice little beach restaurant / bars ideal for a snack or a cocktail in the evening watch the sunset
Stunning sunset,First time in goa this beach is beautiful and the sunset just perfect  beach shacks serve excellent seafood
Beautiful long beach ... and clean sand,"We had dinner at a shack 'Rogers' - excellent experience, good food and service. Try their Beef chilly, Pomfret fry, Non-veg Sizzlers"
The Quiet Benaulim,The best thing about the Benaulim Beach is that it is still rather undiscovered by domestic tourists even though it is a famous beach for fishing. Benaulim Beach is a very quiet beach. One can just laze the day off soaking in the sun. Benaulim Beach gives you the pleasure and the satisfaction of being in Goa.
Hello,Had been there just two day's ago lovely beach absolutely clean nice shack to have good food n drinks. You can spend time sitting in shacks n watching sunset n sipping...... Relax n enjoy.
Good for bathing,"Probably the best beach for sea bathing, in South Goa. The waves here are pretty gentle, and the quality of water is extremely good. The quintessential aquamarine color of the sea is pretty prominent here, because of water quality. It also has good shacks. Both Colva and Benaulim are very long beach, which gives people a very good opportunity to have a stroll along the shoreline. This November I visited South Goa beaches from Arossim to Palolem. For the trip report search google with ramblersnaps + South Goa"
Best beach in north goa,Excellent clean beach. Most serene and beautiful beach of north goa. Little secluded though. Enjoyed with kids
Beautiful ,"It’s such a lovely beach, loads better than Colva. Recommend walking away from the main entrance area to quieter shacks."
Lovely wide beach. Every restaurant over-charged us. Beware.,"We've been here a week.Lovely wide beach. Every restaurant over-charged us.As high as 30% of our food bill.Every day, the same:- we check the bill, double-check the menu- the waiter blames the cashier- lengthy waits, recalculating- more apologising- everyone is embarrassedCheck everything.....Sunset dinners of drama."
Cool & Secluded,"This beach is located at Benaulim, a suburb of Madgaon & is a southward extension of Colva Beach. Here the beach is flat, wide & sandy. The beach & its surrounding area is overall clean with quiet, natural ambience. Though only a few visitor was there at afternoon, the place scatterdly filled up during sunset, probably due to turn up of local visitors. There is not many provision for fun or refreshment except one or two beach side eateries, as we found open during our visit at off season. But serenity & calmness is the matter make this place a special. A long, leisure walk along the beach with setting sun would be enjoyable. A parking area is there at the entrance of the beach but no public vehicle is available, for which one has to walk for at least 20 minutes to reach main road to Madgaon except being lucky to get the service of infrequent Auto at evening time.The place is not yet commercialised. No street vendors, no stalls on approach, no hustle bustle of tourists, the place is rather a bit isolated from the locality. There are few appartement on the approach road near to the beach & those would be the ideal choice for the visitors looking for a relief from busy life within the nature & with ownself."
Beach fun,"A vibrant and active beach with enough space for people to have their fun. You can do just about everything here, have a drink, have a bite, jet ski, para glide or just take walk. The shacks give you the option to just sit out from the sun and chill as well."
Beautiful beach,Non smoking beach so clean and tidy lots of local families there early evening enjoying sea and sunset
Best clean beach,"Less crowdy means very clean and lots of place for scenic views and picture, though shaks were not so good, but ok. Still I want to enjoy the beach with kids and family. For two full days I was at the beech, got lots of sun burn and enjoyed at the fullest.Taken an apartment near the benaulim beach, that was the best decision.First two days royal around Goa sites in an innova, then decided to stay back at the beach and have lazy days and evenings at Benaulim. Sun set of Benaulim is a No Miss."
Quiet and clean beach,Beach has a couple of shacks but is pretty quiet during off-season. The beach is very clean and safe even during late evenings.
nice clean beach,Nice and clean beach. Really quiet at october. We was only one in beach. Waves was too high to swim and sun was too hot to spend time here
One of the best beaches for relaxing in Goa,"If you’re looking for some place to just relax and revive in Goa, please do visit Benaulim Beach in South Goa.Pros :- Calm and Peaceful- Enchanting Sunsets - Nearby Beach Resorts - Less Crowded Cons:Note : It’s not like Baga or Calangute with a night life and drinking."
Nice quiet beach !!,Benaulim Beach is in South Goa. Hotel Taj Exotica is located here. It is a very long and peaceful beach. In September swimming in the sea was not allowed due to strong current. Due to off season only one water scooter was operating. There were no shacks open who normally start functioning from October to May.An excellent beach for a long relaxes walk !!
peaceful beach,nice quiet peaceful beach. Not too crowded. limited no of shacks open during the time visited. good option try for early morning visit
Benaulim beach site view,Benaulim beach site view is very nice and beautiful and also silent. There was no crowd for site scenes and lot of enjoyment done along with the family members. This place or activity comfortably accommodate for the people who likes silent zone.

Quite and peaceful beach,Benaulim beach is very quite beach with few shacks in South Goa. It was one of the very few beaches which had 2-3 shacks open in mid september.

Cool and quite beach,"Good, cool.calm and clean beach , had great morning run at sand, at walkable.distance from.hotels.  full to sea gems on the beach"

"Silent beach, perfect for couples and photography","Silent beach, perfect for couples who want privacy. Explore beach beauty at early morning and late evening.You will found mostly fishermen and few local people for walk. You will also found lots of jellyfish at seashore."

Clean and peaceful beach,"Visited Benaulim Beach during last week of Sept'18, it was a fascinating sight of clean beach with less noise levels. Eateries have breathtaking view of scenic beach. enjoyed with family for couple of hours"
Peaceful,"Away from market areas, v peaceful n calm. You can spend hours here n wud come again n again....👌👌"
Excellent long beach with shallow waters ,A big fan of this place. Very long beach. The water is shallow and just laps around till ankle until 30m into the sea. Sand is very firm and doesn't leave footprints. Good restaurants along the beach. Great for families especially with small kids.
Nice clean ,Its a nice clean beach. Clear waters and quiter beach unlike the dirty and crowded north goa beaches.
Place to be on a sunny Day,Its just no one beach if you know some locals you could also find other opening to the beach which are not that crowded compared to the one which is easily accessible and where you will see the restaurants and food stalls.
Great Beach,"Benaulim beach is clean, less crowded and less nosey. You can enjoy long walk without any disturbance. Water sports here is expensive than north goa but it seems security precaution here is better than north goa. While you are on beach don't engage with stray dogs they become aggressive easily."
Beautiful quiet and clean beach,"We had a walk on the beach and lunch at Jonhcy, really nice fish right in front of the ocean. The only unpleasant period was that the women selling bracelets were sooooo insistent."
A beautiful beach,The beach of Benaulim is of the finest sand. There is very little rubbish on the beach as people are employed to collect it. The beach shacks serve some excellent food especially fish at low prices in fact ir's the only place I've been that you can eat lobster for under £10. The atmosphere is friendly.
Clean and quite beach to relax,"If you are looking to avoid the crowd and just want to spend some quality time at the beach, you should definitely come here. The beach is very clean and generally not crowded. You will almost always find certain sections of the beach available for yourself and you can find lot of local people coming down for a walk with their dogs. You can also see fisherman sorting out the fishing nets and selling fresh catch to the local people.There are a few shacks which become active post the sunset and a good place to hangout post your evening stroll at the beach. There is ample parking spacing also nearby the shacks."
goa in monsoon,beach is clean and low public so we can enjoy it nicely life guyard is alway there for the safety go with camera ane swimming costume
Goa in Monsoon,This beach is very close to the city clean beach life guard is alway there go for the short visit go with swimming cloths also with camera the sunrise and sun set is very good
Good Beach in South Goa,Visited Benaulim Beach in the evening at 5 pm. The beach was clean. Has some snacks and drinks at Pedro shack.
A good Beach,"Access of the beach is through a messy area, however the beach itself is quite good. The only problem is the dogs around. I went during the rains so except for one, all shacks were closed. I think it will be quite lively during the tourist season."
a very neat and pleasant beach,"one of the best beaches in south goa, has some amazing restaurants and bars. If you have kids then its even more good as there are not many people here. clean and blue waters.."
Quiet beach for some quiet time,"Benaulim Beach is one of the best beaches in South Goa and it is uncrowded, maybe because we went during the monsoon.. Clean beach so hopefully travellers who visit this place, be responsible keep this clean as always. Collecting shells was my favorite part! Even brought some back as a memory to Ireland!"
South Goa Beaches,"Benaulim beach uncrowded beach in south goa, where you can spent your quality time without any disturbance. Here you can collect sea shells and you can see fisherman catching fish and crabs."
Clean beach,The beach is comparatively cleaner then most of the beaches. The sunset view from the beach is very good and morning walks are also refreshing.
Clean beach with less crowd,It's a good place if you're looking to just chill. There aren't a lot of shacks/restaurants or any water sports. Main crowd comes from Taj.
Peaceful and romantic,"Very nice and clean beach. Very less crowded unlike the overcrowded beaches of North Goa. We had an exhilarating time here. Ideal for honeymoon couples. Very peaceful and romantic. A humble request to the visiting travellers - please do not litter or leave behind your leftovers, carry an extra bag and dispose them off in a trashbin. India is blessed with inimitable natural resources, but we do not maintain them clean like the western countries do."
Sojourn to remember ,"Great stay. Had a lovely time. Lovely hospitality, ever ready staff, delicious food, wide variety of outdoor activities and recreation.Beach of hotel is lovely"
Chandan Singhal,"Visited during monsoon, lots of high tides n rough sea.. beach n water were also not clean. Maybe it's the weather n rain but it was a bad experience from beach point of view."
Fishing season ,Beautiful clean beach. Very quiet off season but very lively once the beach shacks go up. You can buy fresh fish straight from the boat.
beach is ok.Many dogs,"Not too crowded.Feels like having a long walk.But you are interrupted by bunch of dogs at places, spoiling the mood."
Very clean!,The benaulim beach is extremely neat and clean. Unlike other beaches it is not at all crowded. As a result there is no mess. The serenity can be enjoyed at its fullest. In monsoon season i could thoroughly enjoy the beach without worrying about messing my clothes with the filth lying around on the beach.
A Calm and serene beach,Benaullim beach is very calm and quiet beach. A serene place for nature lovers. As we went in monsoon season it was just lush green. V enjoyed a lot. Only thing there are many stray dogs on and around beach but they dont creat any trouble to visitors. They are among themselves.
Clean and serene ,"One of the few cleanest beaches I have seen in a while. Long stretch with few wanderers, awesome place to spend time with your loved once."
A serene beach,"Very nice, clean and safe beach. We did not see any danger while in the waters. The waves are good, not too big."

Yummy food with Big screen FIFA World Cup,"We Visited this place again and it's awosome, hot yummy food in the rainy reason along with excited FIFA world cup on big screen."

Benaulim sunset Beach,"Benaulim beach is small, quiet beach in south Goa, very clean and very scenic. Sunset is beautiful here. small shops and shacks are around the beach."
Long clean beach with good restaurant options,Benaulim beach is one of the good beaches in South Goa and it has some great restaurant options as well. Secluded in most parts as it is a very long beach with restaurants only in the main central area. Johncy's is one of the good restaurants where you get good fresh seafood cooked in Goan style.
Lovely peaceful beach,"Lovely peaceful beach, not commercial. Less people. Nice for some quite time and walk. The beach is pretty flat is good for nice dip in the water.The beach has some nice restaurant. Have eaten at Johncy. Has good food."
Benaulim Beach,"It is just a awesome beach.Neat and clean,peacefull atmosphere,cooperative life guards and local peoples.You can view the sunset here in the evening which is mesmerizing.one more special thing which you can see here that there are many little puppies and dogs who are very human friendly...."
Excellent Beach with minimal crowds and water sports,"Its a very good beach in south goa, not many people. It has water sports and surroundings are very clean. Parasailing and speed boat activities are there on the beach. Its 15 min by road from Colva. Spent an hour time relaxing in the calming sea.There was an alert guard at the beach who warned people from going deep inside the sea."
Quite relaxing beach,Quite beach to enjoy with kids and family. Not the most scenic but a nice beach to relax. The beach is clean and normally calm where you can swim and enjoy the warm sunny Goan weather
Enjyoable One,This was my First visit to any of the Beach i have enjoyed allot with my friends. Mist visit place in Goa
Nice beach.,"Benaulim Beach seems quite nice although I didn't venture in.  It's only days away from the monsoon season so the sea was a bit wild and dangerous.  As such, none of the umbrellas and shacks are there now, however there are several permanent restaurants."
Summer Holiday,"Too many stray dogs around.More like north Goa beaches.Sanctity and peace of South Goa missing.Stray dogs follow u till car park, so a bit scary."
Get the feel of North Goa in South,You have many shacks to enjoy good food .You can also enjoy water sports Lot of transport options from the Beach Very Lively at night
short break after long time,"clean beach , not much crowdy dint see any water sports or any activates going as it was may end an early moonsoon tides were high so could not enjoy the beach much not many restaurants nearby."
I love the waves!,It is one of my favourite beaches in Goa. It used to be less crowded earlier. Now its just big restaurants and fancy food and etc.. but nothing can change the waves and the water here.. big waves.Take time and visit this beach. A lot to eat around the beach now..
Unspoiled Gem,"This beach is really clean and crisp water,one of the best managed in terms of life guards and lots of water sports"
Excellent Beach,"Beach is very beautiful and well maintained, water is clear and clear. This beach also has exciting Water Sports. We really enjoy this beach, specially the sunset."
Nice place ,Nice beach. It is clean.Lots of food options available at beach itself with many restaurants.Wonderful sunset 🌅 at beach. Nice place
IMHOP i think its one of the best beaches in India.,"this beach has life guards who are bang on with the children, and any eronious wild life that maybe shouldn't be there they do a great job!"
THE Beach,"Think Leonardo ‘The Beach’ and you won’t be far off how stunning this place is, white sands, clean water, waves, gentle breeze, swaying palms and perfect sunsets.A must visit if in Goa."
Sands of time,"A quiet beach of pristine white sand with a lot of water sport activity available. Clean but watch out for the life guards, they allow swimming even when the ""Red"" flag is up, nearer the evening, they walk off with the flag altogether!!"
Relaxing,"Near azaya beach resort, clean and relaxing to the core, enjoyed a lot with my girlfriend. lots of dining options."
Miles of Sand,"Superb beach when it comes to miles of golden sand, be mindful the sea is quite rough at times with reasonable wave height so swimming is not so easy, the water is easily accessible with no rocks and a very shallow entry, perfect for a paddle. HT."
Peaceful less crowded beach,This is more peaceful less crowded beach compared to bagha and colva beaches few eat outs around but lots of sea side shack hotels if u walk 200 meters
Beach,"Lovely clean beach with life guards on duty, although not great to swim in due to strong currents and big waves. Not clear enough to snorkel. Great value for money beach shacks for food and cocktails. Lots of stray packs of dogs on the beach which can be quite intimidating. Witnessed a few people get attacked which was not nice. Lots of beach sellers that will constantly pester you every day until you buy from them."
Benalium beach,Benalium beach is a nice beach.  Lesser crowd and orderly.  Calm a beach.  A relaxing place in SouthGoa.  Must visit.
Quite and clean beach,"We stayed at the Taj. The beach is relatively quite, clean and appealed to our liking though you cannot compare goan beaches to for example Alicante or Mallorca where the water is turquoise green and you can see the sand under water."
Goa trip with school buddies!,Cleanest and bluest beach I have seen.. I love the fact that it was not crowded. Peaceful and a calming experience for me and my buddies.
Nothing special ,"My friend and I were staying in a resort hotel so thought it would be nice one day to see Benaulim beach. However, we were a little disappointed with the lack of atmosphere. The beach it’s self is nothing special and there are hardly any bars or restaurants around. Do not travel to Benaulim just for the beach."
Beautiful clean beach,"Good number of shacks, clean beach with all the water sports and life guard on duty. One of the best beaches in south Goa."
Lazing on the sand,"A very pretty, quiet, clean and not too crowded beach that offers water sports and great food in shacks - all types of food but their specialty is sea-food."
Quietest beach of Goa,This beach is one of the quietest beach of Goa. It starts from where the Colva beach ends. It has lots of shack shops which sell clothes & other items. Please wear hats in case you visit the beach after 10am as its extremely hot.
Lazy days in the sun,"I spent every day at some-point during my stay in Benualim lazing on the sun loungers, eating food at Aggies mahal, drinking beers watching the world go by! Great quite beach..perfect!"
Holiday,Benaulim beach is a very long stretch of warm sandy beach. The waters ate warm and not too choppy. Lifeguards are on duty all along the beach and there are plenty of places to eat and drink as well. It is a lovely beach to spend the day on and plenty of sun beds to use.
Goa holiday ,"Fab beach, clean and unhurried, shack restaurants excellent value. Very long Beach great walking with pit stop🍺🍴"
relaxed,"good beach in south goa, nless crowd but it was relaxed,travellers must go to benaulim and from beach to beach you can reach colva beach"
