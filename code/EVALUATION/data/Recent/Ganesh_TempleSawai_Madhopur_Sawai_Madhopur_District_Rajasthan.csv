Nice Temple,"An ancient temple situated in the fort premises. Quite a trek to get to the temple, but worth seeing as you get to see the ruins of the wonderful fort. Definately worth a visit during your stay at Ranthambore."
Divine,"One of its kind. Must visit to seek blessings. The temple idol is very ancient and is linked to royalty and fort.Hire a guide for rs. 500, worth a walk to soak in history of India."
Ganpati Bappa Morya.....,This is very important Hindu Temple of God Shri Ganeshji - People worship here with first card of their marriage and have faith in god for successful accomplishment of complete marriage ceremony.
excellent views,"absolutely not to be missed, climb up the fort and visit the temple, very good experience will definitely recommend specially in the good weather"
Worth a visit,"If you are someone who worships Lord Ganesha, then you MUST visit, as they say this temple is the Headquarters and rest are just branches. It can get insanely crowded on occasions so ask your hotel guys the best time to visit."
Good experience,1. Access is through the Ranthambore fort.2. You need to wear sports foot wear as the fort needs to be explored on foot.
Unique temple,"This is a unique temple of Ganeshji where he has THREE eyes. Usually, only Lord shiva has three eyes. This temple is in Ranthambore fort and visited very frequently by villager. It was a blissful experience. Must visit place for all"
In the Wild!,"This is in Zone 3 and very near to territory of tigers. There is a gate in between anyhow. We spotted two tigers just near the gate, which is close to the temple."
Beautiful Temple,"Ranthambore is second home for me, as wildlife enthusiast I keep on visiting Ranthambore National Park very oftenly.The first thing for me to do in Ranthambore is to visit the Ganesh temple to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesh for a good wildlife expedition.The temple is located at the far end of the famous Ranthambore Fort and it's a uphill walk that will take 30-45 minutes.Once you the top you can visit the temple, see the famous Ranthambore National Park from the top and visit the ruins of a great fort."
Worth a visit,I enjoyed climbing the steps and seeing the temple.  Lots of monkeys.  They have guides that you can hire if you want the history of the site.
Hindu temple,This temple is special because here Lord ganesha have 3 eyes and resides with full Family that is riddhi siddhi and children shubh and labh
Temple in the fort,"The temple is situated in the Ranthambore fort. A leisurely walk from the car park will take around 30 minutes to the temple. Initially there are many steep steps but it’s easier later on. Apart from the Ganesh temple, there are many other places of worship inside the fort belonging to various religions."
Sacred & Divine visit to Lord Ganesha,"This site seeing is Ranthambhore Fort - cum - Ganesh temple. Ranthambhore Fort & Ganesh temple are one and the same thing. You trek the fort and on top you get to visit the divine temple. Do have a guide along. He will give you useful tips on the fort architecture and the strategy used by the kings. The steps leading to fort are not that steep. We managed to trek with our 3 year old kid. It took an hours time to reach the top. The trek is not tiring. We went in afternoon 3pm, without feeling the heat. Go empty handed & don't carry anything eatables in your hands. Monkeys might snatch any eatables from your hands. Don't worry, the monkeys are not wild. They bother you only when you have any eatables in your hand. Else they will not bother you. Infact they are a sight to your eyes watching them climbing from one trees to another.The Panditji (priest) gave my daughter a garland (Ganesha blessing) and my daughter wore it in her neck. Monkey snatched it when we came out of the temple. It was scary.To all the believers, lord Ganesha loves Dhub (a green grass type leaves). Don't forget to offer this to lord Ganesha. Also you will see a lot of houses built with stones in the temple premises, Locals believe that lord Ganeshas blessing will help you get your own house. You can try your luck. It is also fun to build house with stone.This temple has a lot of religious importance especially with Rajasthanis / Marwaris. All Marwari marriage cards undoubtedly come here to seek Ganesha blessing, which is believed to be very divine & sacred. This is the only temple where Ganesha is seen in three eyes with his entire family - both wife (Riddhi Siddhi) and both kids (Shubh Labh). Believed to be very auspicious temple by Marwaris."
Oldest hanuman temple ,Very old temple but filthy and dirty really sad. It is a heritage site and very poorly maintained  no cleanliness also The give should and must ensure it is clean A blot on our country
God in Fort.,the temple is situated at the top of the ranthambore  fort.lot of monkeys are present there.the fort is situated in the park itself.the zone gates are different in the park.
Nice place to be in Gangtok,"It is located in Gangtok not very far from the city. You an buy the Tibetan prayer flags from here and as these flags are religious, it should be used after offering prayer, if you are Hindu you can perform ""sankalp"" here and then use these flags in your vehicle. Outside temple you can enjoy Maggi, waiwai, thukpa. if you are lucky you can see Kanchenjunga from here."
Attractive Temple,We visited this temple on next day on 17 August 2019. Temple Decorated very well with beatiful lights.Prayed for Healthy and happy life.Pujari ji gives us delicious Prasad and his Behivour so cool.
Jai Ganesh...,Temple located inside Ranthambore Fort at the Top... Good 3-4 km walk to reach here... Spiritual Place of Worship... Mostly crowded and lots of Monkeys here.... Best time to Visit is Morning's...
Temple visit,This temple is very famous among most of the Rajasthani hindus. In most of the Rajasthani community all the invitation cards especially wedding cards are first sent to this temple to invite the Lord and after that it is distributed among friends and relatives.During wedding season tonnes of invitation cards are received in this temple.there is definitely some divine power in temple.The best time to visit is between October to february.
"Holy place, respect of tradition","No access available, long walk but worth every step. The Siva temple and grounds outstanding. Ganesh temple a sight to behold, embrace the 3xperience wholehearedly."
Ganesh Temple on Top of Fort,"This temple is very famous in the locals. The temple is on the top of the fort. There are a lot of money roaming near the temple for the prasad. If you are visting this place in summer, it is better to go there early in the morning to avoid summer heat."
lord ganesha,yes this temple is a part of fort. ma y mouse and monkey were there. we feed them. temple is located on top of fort to reach there we need to cross approx 250 stairs.
spiritual experience,"it was my second time. Best, as due to the heat we went very early in the morning thus got there before opening and few minutes before starting the function."
Ganesh Temple at Fort,Good and religious place to visit. I suggest do not purchase the coconut and prasad from nearby shops as it is not good
Beautiful temple ,"This was a true Indian experience where you learn more about the culture of the area and see the gorgeous temples. Also, you can feed wild monkeys here, which was amazing! Note there are quite a lot of steps, so moderate fitness required."
Beautiful,"Visited Ganesh temple in Ranthambore fort, it was a hot day but we enjoyed the walk upto the temple, came across lots of monkeys and langoors and were blessed ."
Memorable,Though the flight of steps leading up to the Ganesh Temple is tiring but visiting the ancient temple is worth the effort.
Holy Ganesha,Very old temple of lord Ganesha and his family. Situated in Ranthambore fort. must visit. Dont forget to take the guide with you otherwise you will not enjoy the fort
Beautiful  ganesh temple,Beautiful  old temple  of ganesh. One of the oldest  ganesh temple in ranthambore .it is one of the ganesh temple  near national  park  and lots of devotees comes every day to visit this  temple
Memorable vist to fort,"A visit to Ganesh Temple is an excursion in itself which could easily take around 2 hr. Ganesh Temple is located in the Ranthambore Fort area. You need to climb 300 odd steps to reach the Ranthambore Fort and further a km or two to reach the Ganesh Temple. The Ranthambore Fort lies in the National Park  itself, journey was fantastic. Its a point worth considering since wildlife are in abundance in this area, and Tigers are also known to roam around here.  The walk to Ganesh Temple will also showcase some other smaller temples, a pond, a mosque and a galore of Langurs (white monkeys). The Temple is famous since this is known to be the only temple where Lord Ganesh resides with both his wives (Riddhi & Siddhi) and Sons"
Must place to visit!!,Trinetra Ganesha Temple is the famous and oldest temple of Lord Ganesha in Rajasthan that comprises of his whole family all together at one place. The temple is about 12 kms from Sawai Madhopur and is well established in Ranthambhore fort.We truly enjoyed being there .Its a beautiful place to visit .
"Connect with famity tree, historical ","In our family tree, had been inviting Ranthambore fort Ganesh ji since ages. Got change to visit them for the first time. Very nice , nostalgic connect. Very nice temple."
Lovely place,Great place and view. Superb Tracking. Much recommended place during Ranthambore visit. Don't miss it.
I love Lord Ganesha,I have visited with my husband after marriage.I loves the temple which is situated at the top of the Ranthambhore Fort.I feel lucky to be there.Thanks
Different,Really enjoyed this fort. Much different than we thought. A young couple walked up the steps by us with a yoke with brass pots on with milk. Get the top of the steps by the temple and there are cows - all bizarre! Beautiful views over the national park. Don't be put off by the height or the steps they are not steep and there are lots of places to stop to look at things and the views. We went early which was pleasant. Our jeep driver was kind and stopped to show us lots of things on our journey to and fro to the fort.
Very Pleasant & Spiritual Place,"Don't carry any eatable item in your hand as there are lot of Langurs, ready to snatch it from your hands. Beware of the fake BABA (standing near stairs - outside the temple), ready to make you fool with their superstitious beliefs.."
Not recommended to take private car,"It was a trekking for us. Had to climb a lot for Ganesh temple. The fort is surrounded with a lot of monkeys. Do not carry any food items along with you while climbing the fort. The darshan was good, we couldn’t eat the prasad As the monkeys took the entire ladoo box from our hand. While going back one monkey jumped on a car next to ours and broke the front glass of the car. Not recommended to take your private car to this place."
Great,"Ganeshji with Trinetra & full family its a very different feel & atmosphere,one has to climb app 276 stairs but not tiring.Lot of langoors outside temple"
Amazing spiritual experience,A must visit site in Sawai Madhopur. A unique temple with a Self evolved statue of Ganesh. Felt completely at peace here.
The temple itself is kind of disappointing,"The temple itself is kind of disappointing, Great walking very interesting through the Fort but the temple itself is Very basic although supposedly it’s the most famous temple in India because it supposed to bring you good luck"
Ancient temple in ranthambore fort.,Temple is located in nationl park area. Good place for visit in ranthambore fort. Fort and temple are must visit place in ranthamobre.
nice to visit but only once,the temple inside is toòoo far... kids cant walk so much so beware they will definitely get frustrated as there is nothing to eat .. and if you carry something with you .. dont dare to take it out... all the langoors will attack you anytime.do carry water with you but keeping in mind there is no place to go to washroom :) near the temple ...its really difficult to go inside.. and dont get the prasad out .. eat it inside and walk out with empty hands. ..otherwise the langoor will come and take it from you.
"Langoors on the way, Fort upon the hill, other temples around Ganesh Temple","Ganesh Temple was adjacent to the Forest / Ranthamboor National Park. One needs to climb a number of stairs to reach Ganesh Temple. There were 2-3 other small temples in between, while traversing the fort, towards the Ganesh Temple. There were Langoors on the way. Outside the Ganesh temple, one of the Langoor's held my right hand with his right hand and took eatables when I offered it. The fort area was mesmerizing and Ganesh Temple was spreading spiritual vibes. Overall experience was memorable."
amazing fort and lord Ganesha,"Placed high up on the ranthambore fort,its devine.there is lots to walk and around 200 steps to climb,but at the end its all worth the pain.beware of monkeys,don't carry food.The fort is amazing nad dont forget to take the guide who explain the history n architect of fort"
Nice temple,Temple is situated within Ranthambore Fort and is at the last of the fort. Temple is surrounded by lots of langoors so be cautious.
Nice view of the city From Fort,We visited this place it has panaromic view and from the top of the fort we saw all jungle. It's really nice to visit all these places
Nice trek to Nice temple,It's one of the most beautiful trek to one of the most famous temples in Rajasthan. Just the drive to entrance takes you through the ranthambore forest. The trek starts from 1st gate of ranthambore Fort and by the end you are through whole of the fort. Do hire a guide to properly go through various points in the fort.
good trekking,good walk up the fort but lotta monkeys so be careful with food items / chips in ur hand. senior citizens/ knee problems/ handicapped may not b able to climb.
Good city view from the top!,Its age old Ganesha Temple inside the fort. Fort is nothing but a heritage site now but not well maintained. The view from the top is mesmerizing as it gives you full city view and view of the dense Ranthambore forest.
Must visit attraction ,Divine experience here .. must visit after your safari ... huge fort with the Divine Ganeshji Temple .. loads of monkeys .. fun trip
A Religious delight,"Its a little long Walk from the entrance. The  fun loving and palyful Langoors on the way and at the Entrance to the Temple make your journey enjoyable,"
God of the jungle,"Located in ranthambhor fort, surrounded by jungle make this more adventurous to visit temple.lots of langur bandar is another attraction."
Visited enroutes to safari ,Ganesh temple is very revered. Takes around half an hour to reach the top of the temple on foot. Temple is on the way to tiger safari. Everyone says that If you see white rat in the temple your all wish are come true.Be aware of the black monkeys.
Excellent place,Excellent place to visit. Having few temples at the top of the hill. Having few lakes. Total 300 steps to reach at the top of the hill which is known as Ranthambore Fort.
Jai Ganesh.,It was first visit and I was very excited to go there. It's very beautiful temple. You should visit once.
Amazing View,Make the climb to view the entire landscape surrounding the fort. The journey to this temple will let you experience the lush flora and fauna within the area as well.
Cool place,Ganesh Temple was well known place to visit. To reach here we have to pass through forest area. Natural environment was attractive here.
This is a very popular temple.,"It is a common belief that the first invitation to a wedding is addressed to this deity. It is the only temple in the world where Lord Ganesh is depicted as one with three eyes.The location of this temple is on the top of a fort, hence a number of steps have to be climbed.Another problem is the resident Langoor Monkeys.One should avoid carrying food in hands to avoid the same being snatched by the apes."
Beautiful Experience,The journey to temple in itself a great experience which involves passing through jungle and then reaching the fort where we walked up to visit the trinetra ganesh temple. We got a guide (rate negotiable) and was nice to know the history of place and temple. We came across monkeys but were not aggressive while we were passing by. View of mountain and jungle is amazing from fort and maintenance of structure and garden inside is OK. Must visit.
Discovering India,What an amazing jewel in the midst of the park. Lovely to see monkeys and humans in co existence. nice walk to top to see temple
Jai ganesh,Very beautiful temple with great view. Monkey all around and we given nuts to them. When we entered in temple feel energy.
Only temple of lord ganesha alongwith shubh & labh,The way to temple is starting same when we go to Ranthambore national park.today because of diwali around 2 lakh people comes.it is the only temple in world along with full family of lord Ganesha at one place.must sight to visit.
Jai Ganesh ,We visited this great devotional place today evening. It was worth visiting. This temple is very very famous and lots of people follow this temple religiously. The temple is situated inside Ranthambhor Fort. You have to climb about 200 steps and about 2.00km walking to reach this place.Be aware of monkeys as they can grab any eatery from your hand.Do note the The timing ; you must start from Sawai madhopur by lately 4.00pm because you have to come back out of forest before 6:00 pm. Parking is very big problem.. As road to Fort from town is very narrow.
Wonderful views of the Forest,"This is a must visit place at Ranthambore. Not very difficult to hike up to the Fort. This place has Hindu temples, Jain temples,Dargah, a beautiful garden. There is small Shiva temple tucked below a large structure near the entrance at the top of the hill, do not miss it. Offers wonderful panaromic views of zone 3 of the Ranthambore National Park. You can easily spend 2-3 hrs here. Great place to see, beware of monkeys and langurs here though.."
Well worth the 300 + steps,"Great morning out, I say morning because we visited at 9;am before the rush started, great views, bring food for the monkeys they are very friendly"
Situated at Ranthambhore fort.,The temple is situated in the fort. It takes half an hour to reach there by foot and there is no any option to go there by any vehicle but its worth it for such a holy place.
Trinetra Ganpati temple,"The first thing that comes to mind about this temple is thr fear.... fear of langoors! There are hundreds of them waiting to pounce on you if they spot you with any food. Your hands are empty and they leave you alone! Having said that, this is the only 3 eyed Ganpati temple i…"
Very old and nice temple,A very nice trek to start with. Place is very calm and nice. Awesome view of Jaipur city from top. Worth the trek. But priest was least interested in sharing the details/history of this place.
Trinetra Temple in the Ranthambore Temple,Ganesh Temple is located in Ranthambore fort and attracts lots of devotees. This temple is surrounded by the hills and green forest and has lots of Langur Monkeys.You may visit this temple while visiting Ranthambore Fort.
Trinetra Ganesh Temple at Ranthambhore Forte at Hill Top,"Must visit this place for point of view of religion, architecture & archeology. Lots of devotees send first marriage invitation card to the Ganesh ji prior to inviting any one."
Ganeshji with family..unique ,Trinetra Ganeshji is one of its kind having third eye to bless you with wisdom. Ganeshji is there with entire family. Guide Naresh made it interesting. Good tracking experience as well. Must visit place
excellent experience!,A lot of nature and spiritual atmosphere. I pass a day the and I managed to deconnect myself from the regularly life and start my adventure in India
Ancient Temple,"Trinetra Ganesh Temple situated at the top of Ranthambore fort situated in the middle Ranthambore National Tiger Reserve the mandir is as old as the fort, the fort was made by Chouhan dynasty (Raja Hameer Dev). you can feel there the religious power."
A walk to remember,"The Ganesh temple from the road is 300 stairs away. No vendors in the way but you will find the stores after climbing the stairs. Yes, there were rats, not many."
Really Nice Place,We have visited the place in the month of Aug . The place is really wonderful when you will visit the trample you will really feel the peace.
Lovely view. Filthy temple,"Brilliant location. Filthy temple. No God will likely make such a neglected and dirty place home. Monkeys are everywhere picking crumbs and sifting through the mess pilgrims leave behind. Empty plastic packages are strewn everywhere as is organic waste from discarded food besides dollops of dung, all of which force pilgrims to battle swarms of flies. A temple of great beauty and potential has been decimate by bad management."
Mesmerizing natural beauty,"Though I am not a very religious person, but I liked this place because of its scenic views and natural approach. The way is not tough, bit of walking is required to reach the temple. Localittes believe this place to be sacred and they also have faith in the God. Here they even say that if you build house by placing small rocks like a house, you will be able to get your own house soon."
Ganpati Bappa Morya... Mangal Murti Morya...,"First of all a great thank to those artisans and labourers of that ancient time who did this uphilly architect without having modern tools and technology.hAmazing sight seeing, number of small forts/Hawankunds, ponds and all above Lord Ganesha with his Savari, the cute mouse.Everything is so mesmerizing in the lap of Lord and nature that can't be described how beautiful it is!One thing the visitors should have to care about is that a number of stairs (more than 100) have to be crossed, which is tough for old age devotees.A flock of beautiful peacocks can't stop you from clicking a snapshot.Hold your hand bags tight, otherwise monkeys would take it away.Jai Lord Ganesha..."
Best tamale in India ,"The manager suggests us to visit Ranthambore fort and provide us jeep for that , the fort had different art of building you will find all history stone in fort . You can recognise the long history of war. There was temple of Ganesh is only temple of Ganesha with three eyes . We pry for our  good future and blessing."
**The Elephant Deity Beckons you in the wild **,"I have always wondered about the location of this Ancient Trinetra  Ganesh Temple, situated in the Ranthambore fort. I enjoy the long trek, through the fort up on the hillock, and the view of the Tiger Sanctuary is mesmerizing from the top. The Fort is grand in all ways. The walk is the major attraction for me followed by Beautiful Darshan, the Calm , the Beauty , the freshness in  air and  is a relief.A word of caution here - The temple is situated far,  its steep at places  , will not advice you to  go on full stomach, trek difficult for the elderly, young kids might throw a tantrum to walk that far, the weather if its summer- prefer going early morning, the place has many clans of Monkeys which sit comfortably all over the shops near temple, keep edibles tucked in .  Sipping  Water is a good bet. Walking shoes a must..If you can brave all this, Lord Ganesha showers you with love and blessings, yummy laddoos, the pics  clicked at the fort and temple can be memorable. Have enough time on hand to look around for beauty in flowers, stones, and local people."
Ancient Temple of Idols ofShri Ganesha and Family,"Ganesh Temple is situated in the Ranthambore fort. 25 min  by walk up apox 200 steps and then walk apox 1 km with heritage /archaeological structures/monuments  enroute- . Also you can have good picturesque view of Ranthambore park from top of the fort. Take a binocular if u have.The only temple you will find the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle). You will find lot of monkeys on the way to the temple- they are harmless if you don't tease. Best time to visit is in morning in summers."
Temple atop the fort,"Trinetra Ganesh Temple is situated at the top of the famous Ranthambore fort. One needs to climb stairs and walk to reach the temple. Outside the temple, there are number of monkeys, but they do not harm anyone. A great place of worship with nice views from the top."
Pious Place of Waorship,"My friend Vasant and me were fortunate to have a pleasant darshan of Lord Trinetra Ganesh at Ranthambhore Fort at 0845 on 18th June 2018 . This is the only temple in the world where Ganesh presides with his entire family consisting of his two consorts , Riddhi & Siddhi ; two sons , Shubh & Labh and his wahan  Mushak . We attended one of the five Aaratis , Shringar Aarati sung in the praise of the Lord at 0900 . Other four Aaratis are Prabhat Aarati  at 0600 , Bhog Aarati at Noon , Sandhya Aarati during Sunset i e at 1830 in Summer & at 1745 in Winter  and Shayan Aarati at 2000 daily . In Rajasthan Wednesday is considered Ganesh’s day , so on that day a Special Aarati is offered to the Lord .We were told that in 1299 AD , a war broke out between Chauhan King Hameer of Ranthambhore Fort and Sultan Alauddin Khilji of Delhi and the fort was fortified . As the war prolonged , the stored things in godowns were depleted . King Hameer was a great devotee to God Ganesh . One night when he was sleeping , Lord Ganesh appeared in his dream and said that all the stock would be replenished next day morning . Next day morning , an idol of Lord Trinetra  Ganesh emerged  from one of the walls of the fort and the stocks were replenished . As a gratitude King Hameer built the temple of Lord Trinetra Ganesh in 1300 AD ."
Historical,Historical place .. must see.. learn something from our history &  culture etc.here lord Ganesh Temple

Trinetra Ganesh temple in ranthombore fort.,"The speciality of the ranthombore fort (2nd largest fort of rajasthan), this is situated inside the national park full of tiger leopard sloth bear and other wild animals, so walking in such a place is a thrilling experience.We had visited the place in june during our wild life safari at ranthombore, the atmosphere was too hot so we cannot make up our mind whether we go there or not, outside hotel atmosphere is giving burning sense at skin, at 4.30 we decided finally to go, quickly call a jeep (800 Rs is the regular charge). This is in the same way to the national park in front of the entry point of zone3. On the way we find lots of spotted deer, sambar, birds etc. our jeep driver show the place where T24 (ustad) kill one forest guard.We reach the place at 5pm, there was a ride of about 250 steps, but the walk is easy, lots of monkeys and peacock was around, there are many spot inside fort like, naulakha gate, jain temple, rani haveli, old tomb, battis khamba, anannya purna temple and trinetra jain temple. Guides are charging 500 Rs, in my suggestion no need to take guide everything is mention on board, I do bargain where guide ready to take us in 200 Rs. No entry fee for the fort.Lots of small rock made home was there, as per myth those who made small hose there will be owner of a real home in future life, so we made it also and my little daughter enjoyed a lot.Camera and mobile not allowed inside Ganesh temple, the temple was built by rana hammeer once he got a victory over Muslim ruler alauddin khilji. View of sanctuary from the top of fort is marvellous, zone 3 is very well visible, but you need a good binocular to watch animals, as this place is inside sanctuary not advisable to stay after sunset, temple was close by 7pm,"
Ancient temple ,Ganesha temple is the ancient temple in Hamir fort. Lord Ganesha with Riddhi and Siddhi are worshiped there.one can view the whole beauty of forest from this temple.
Divine experience,We regularly visit this temple. The only problem is the maintenance and Monkey menace. The view from the to is very beautiful
Jai Ganesh,"Ganesh Temple is situated in the Ranthambore  fort. Known as very powerful deity, large number of devotees come here to seek blessings and fulfill their wish. In this temple you will find  the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle).  You will find lot of monkeys on the way to the temple, but if you do not disturb them, you can walk quietly."
A good walk for a day. ,"A temple is located on Ranthambor fort. You can drive through a jungle where you can see peacock, crocodile, deer and some beautiful birds. Then you have to walk to the top of the fort to see the one of biggest forts."
Jai Trinetra Ganesha ,1200 years old temple of Lord Ganesha and the Idol has 3 Eyes...  The Idol is swayambhu...  And DivineAll your wishes comes to  true on worshipping him.
Travelsphere Golden Triangle tour,"We where lucky and saw a tiger , but there's no guarantee our rep went 5 visits without seeing one ,  take a pair of decent binoculars or a camera with at least a x20 zoom as they may be well hidden and some way a way , you iPhone may take a good picture but all you'll see is the landscape , plenty of birds , monkeys and cat food(deer) around , good luck"
Trinetra Ganesh Temple,Such an amazing view once you reach the temple. Feeding the langurs chanas was a nice experience. The langurs are pretty people friendly and not aggressive like we normally see.
Trinetra Ganesh at hilltop!!,"the temple is inside the fort and one has to walk up around 200 stairs to reach the temple. Tempe is dedicated to Lord Ganesha who resides here as trinetra (three eyes) Ganesha.Its a must visit for all as fort gives a good glimpse of the park around, see numerous macaques and some very interesting beliefs of the peopleTips: Ensure not carrying lose bags in hand as macaques will snatch for it, have kachori/pakodi at the local tea stalls"
need to be tough enough to climb 200 steps,Temple is on one of the corner of the fort and one need to climb thru 200 steps and a 20-30 min walk... at temple you may witness many baboons willing to have selfie with you in return of a favour in terms of something to eat... be visible and do not carry anything eatable openly in hands
A special temple atop a hill and inside a fort,Visiting a fort and a temple together is rare. You can enjoy the view of safari park and lakes from the top of fort which is a historical site enlisted in the UNESCO World Heritage list.
The Ganesh temple,last month I visited Ganesh temple with my family there is so peaceful place I come to Ganesh temple every two or three months likely I I am very happy when I come to Ganesh temple we worshipped Shri Ganesh ji and eat food near the temple very tasty food very peaceful place I am so happy to tell you about the Ganesh temple that you must come to Ganesh temple and enjoy your life.
Trinetra Ganesha,"Trinetra Ganesha Temple is located in Ranthambore Fort. The temple is a must visit for all visitors of Tiger Sanctuary who believe in spritual powers of Lord Ganesha and want his blessings, but one should not imagine about a well built, well managed temple. Go with open mind for attacking monkeys, running rats, watery garbage etc etc. Most of our pilgrimage places have the same scene, so no one is to blame for this except we the believers ourselves."
Its a long walk up,Our photography group did a model shoot up at the fort and temple so it was a wonderful ancient backdrop.  Beautiful place to be in late afternoon light and sunset.
LORD,the lord ganesh is worshipped here with his bahan lots of mouse . monkey are creating nuisance other wise excellent
Ganesh temple,"We were in national park for three days and after seen two tigers we prefered to visit fort instead another game drive.It was nice visit and we did not regret it. The temple is authentic place, not reconstructed so it does not seem commercial visit like Tajmahal for exemple.There were only few tourist around rather local people who can be pretty pushing and curious so it is good if you have some local giude with you."
If you are religious Do visit,"We were very unsure to visit the Trinetra Ganesha Temple whic is part of the Ranthambore fort. We were told that there are 530 steps to reach the temple and it take quite some time, well some of this is true but some of it isn't. We were convinced by our resort staff to visit the temple as he felt strongly about us missing somehting important, well! we did not regret it. The temple is some distance up in the fort but the mini hike isn't bad at all. If you can manage to do this in the early hours of the morning, you will really enjoy stepping up to the fort, the view and of course the temple. We decided a bit late in the morning so got slightly tough with the heat but was still something worth visiting. The route to the fort is beautiful, the landscape is beautiful too but the fort is pretty average unless of course you have an eye for photography. If you are looking for blessings from Lord Ganesh, do not miss to visit."
Trinetra ganesh temple,It seems govt is not taking any care of this heritage site. Small area for parking. No water cooler when you walk up to the temple. No cleanliness.
Scenic and Historic beauty. ,"It's a must visit place if you are in Ranthambore.It is a temple made inside the fort.It is located inside the national park region and during the journey, you will find many wild animals. If lucky, you may see a tiger as well.The view of the pond from the top is amazing.The route is a bit tough due to uneven and long steps. Also the route is really hectic for the old people.If you are coming from the city than bring your own car or you will have to hire jeeps to go up and down the fort and still you have to walk a lot.Although the breathtaking view from the top kills the fatigue, but still I won't suggest it for the old people with high BP.Tip: Make sure you don't carry any colorful object with you due to monkey snatching on the route. Thousands of monkeys are there snatching items from tourists. Make sure to put your camera handy and sticky and don't click them by calling them out."
A steep climb but magnificanet views,I first visited 15 years ago and sadly the tourist numbers have clearly increased significantly which makes the blessing at the temple very commercial - but the magic remains
Trinetra Ganapati Temple,Temple is atop a hill near Ranthambore Fort. It is a must visit temple. Lord Trinetra Ganapati alongwith his family is a very beautiful sight. A peaceful place where Lord surely resides.  Praise Lord Ganesha.
Excellent drive,Trinetra Ganesh Temple is located inside the Ranthambore fort and one has to walk for at least 30 mins inside the fort to reach the temple. What i liked the most is the drive inside the forest area to the fort as i could spot a lot of flora and fauna.
"Trinetra Ganesha temple ,Ranthambore ","About 30 min hike , excellent lake view from mid point . In 1300 AD King Hammer built this temple of lord Ganesha at Ranthambore fort ."
Ranthambore fort and ganesh temple,great place for archaeological fans. half day worth tour. decent climb. temples galore on hill top fort. Ganesh Temple itself is not a great structure but a must go for believers.
3 netra Ganesh Temple,"We initally decided to do this on our own , but eventually took a guide with us to understand a bit of history . We reached this place in the afternoon."
Great temple within the Ranthambore fort,The Ganesh temple within the Ranthambore fort is a very lively temple. Already the way to the temple through the fort is wonderful. Take your time to observe the scenery. Also non-Hindus are welcome.
Very interesting historical and religious site,This whole site is hugely impressive. Spread over a very big area in the middle of rathambore national park. We were lucky enough to be given a guided tour by our hotel proprietor who knew the history very well so it's worth getting a guide. We'll worth a visit.
"Top of the fort, confusing information from guide","Not sure if w should blame the guide who accompanied us. But, there was no concrete information about the fort. Rane padmavati and Khilji figured in the history of this fort too. Thousands of monkey around the place, so don't carry eatables"
Temple in the fort.,Beautiful temple great history must visit place. It has a lot of history behind it and is said to be the only temple with Lord ganeshas family.
Very peaceful.,This temple is well known in India. People start all there good things after visiting here. I have been lucky to visit this and spent time at the Temple. Felt so relaxed after visiting this place.God is Great.

Nice temple with a feel of history,Lovely location with breathtaking views around! The entire Ranthambore fort area is an experience! Warning: Be wary of the zillion monkeys!
Maiden visit to  Ganesh Temple in National park Ranthambhore.,It was ausome to pay visit to  Ganesh Temple at Ranthambhore. It was nice to see such huge temple in the fort premises having large followers. Upon Darshan you get solance and achieve the sense of contentment and fulfillment.Very large fort area with lot og monkeys ready to grab the flower garlands you got back from puja in temple. However I was luck to save.my garland from the view and clutches of these monkeys. Overall quite satisfy visit . You need to climb about 200 steps to reach the temple.
Oldest Ganesh Temple,"This temple is said to be a temple of Dwapar Yuga. People offer first invitation of their marriage to Lord Ganesha here. It is also said that invitation of Lord Krishna's marriage was submitted here. This is the only temple where Lord Ganesh is with Shubha, Laabh, Riddhi and Siddhi means whole congregation. Temple is said to be the head office of Lord Ganesha other temples considered to be the branch offices. :PWay of the temple is through the Ranthambore fort which has its own history. King Hammirdeva of Ranthambore gave the asylum to rebel commander of Ala ud din Khilji which no one could even dare in the dream. King Hammirdeva was so adamant that just because of asylum given by him Ranthambore was surrounded and attacked by Khilji. Queens had to do Jauhar. Still he was unshakeable from his decision. That is why in our history it is said that हठ  हो  तो  हमीर  हठ |"
A famous temple within Ranthambore Fort,This is a very famous and powerful temple in this area and people in this area come to seek blessings from Lord Ganesh. You need to climb up the fort and go through part of the fort to reach the temple (which is situated within the fort). You also get an excellent view of a part of Zone 3 in the National Park from the fort.
A unique Ganesh temple with Riddhi & Siddhi!!,This temple is unique as it has Riddhi & Siddhi also along with Lord Ganesh. One has to trek after entering parking of Ranthambore National Park. The temple is surrounded by Langurs. We held some nuts in our hand to feed them and they were peaceful enough to eat them one by one from our hand. Was fun indeed!!
Very Peacefull,"Must go there if you are traveling to RTR, you will anyways go to Fort and the temple is at the end of the fort, the view is pristine."
Must visit place.. during Ranthambore trip,"Situated inside Ranthambore Fort, Trinetra Ganesh Temple is yet another attraction in Ranthambore National Park. Trinetra (Three-Eyed) Ganesh or Pratham Ganesh Temple is amongst the oldest temples in Rajasthan. It is one of those temples,"
If you visit Ranthambhore Fort then do the extra walk to Ganesh Temple,Luckily we had a guide to Ranthambhore Fort which made it very interesting. Although I have knee trouble I didn't find the walk to the Temple too difficult. I enjoyed learning about the history and the customs. There were plenty of Langur monkeys at the temple which people feed so they are extremely tame. Being so high there are some stunning views of the park and lakes.
Famous temple at ranthambore fort,This ancient Ganesh temple is very famous within uncivilized Ranthambore Fort. To visit this temple you have to walk long and climb many stairs in Ranthambore fort. The temple is good and have lots of Langoor(Black face Monkeys). Overall it is must visit place in Ranthambore fort.
Wonderful drive,Approach towards the fort Ranthambore is through the Jungle where you tend to see wild animals. Must visit
Religious place,For hindus its a place for religious sentimental. Highly recommended place for families to go there and spend some quality time there.
Awsme place to visit in mornings ( Just beware of Monkey! ),"Visiting Ganesh temple at Ranthambore is an excellent experience. you will find many animals out on the way to temple. From entry gate, we can take car/cab and rich to the stairs of Ganesh temple which is little tough to climb but you will enjoy the height as well. while climbing beware from monkies, they will snitch your belongings. so please don't carry any stuff with you special any foodstuff.After you reach the temple there is a lake to view and you can see the forest on top of the mountain it's beautiful.Ganesh temple is small but very much popular as its the Temple of marriage in Hindus. People send their invitation cards from around the world to call Ganeshji in their weddings. overall its best in morning hours as Rajasthan is litle hot."
Only TriNetra Ganesh Temple,"Situated in the Ranthambore Fort it is the only TriNetra Ganesh Temple. To reach here one has to trek/walk to the temple. It's a steep climb of about 250 odd steps. The outside of Temple is as usual commercialised. Lots of monkeys hang around here and snatch any food item's in sight.one cant take pics within the temple. Their is a belief that if you make a house with stones lying around, ones wish of having own house is fulfilled."
An ancient temple crowded with langurs,"The temple is said to be of ancient origin. A small temple but people seem to have immense faith in it. Crowded with langurs who are eager to snatch edibles from you.As you approach the temple, you will notice innumerous small small stone assemblies.. these are the structures people make here wishing for the materialisation of their house dreams..The surroundings for sure can be better maintained and cleaner."
Jai Ganesh.. ,V were lucky to visit this temple on our tour to Ranthambhore.. v came to know about this temple through our hotel people and guide which v hired for Ranthambore fort.. believe me that temple is worth visiting since it’s swayambhu murthy and has 3 eyes.. fort is also one of the main excursion there in which this temple is situated .. ppl say this temple is divine and has a power ..
Long walk,This temple is located in the ranthambore fort. Around 1 km walk to reach the temple. Walk is a bit tiring. Lot of langurs on the way to reach the temple. Ranthambore fort is not in a good condition as there is no maintenance.
Ganesh Temple at Rathambor,"This is located in the forest region on top of the Ranthambore fort, which was built by a Chauhan ruler, although the exact name of the ruler is disputed. A widely held belief states that the fort was built the reign of Sapaldaksha, in 944 CE. In 1300 AD, King Hammer built a temple of Lord Ganesh. You can travel by Car or vehicle till car parking zone. Then you have to walk up the fort. About 250 steps. Then you reach the top of the fort. There are various temples ( Hanuman Ji, Ram ji, Maa Anapurna, Jain temple and many more 25 odd) located on top. Walk around 1 km and reach the famous temple is the Trinetra Ganesh ji Temple. He placed the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle)There are mainly five types of aartis taking place every day in this well known temple – Prabhat Aarti (early morning aarti), Sringar Aarti at 9 am, Bhog at 12 noon, Sandhaya Aarti during Sunset (6:30 in the Summer and 5:45 in the winters)People make small houses with 5 stones on the fort. This is done by those praying for a house of their own. It is believed that Ganesh ji blesses all with a home who make such small houses. The trip from car parking to back should take 2 hours.  This is a lovely place to visit for historical site as well as to earn some punya."
Ganesh Temple Visit,"This temple is inside the Ranthambore Fort. We went on Monday and there was hardly any crowd. Beware of the monkeys, they live in huge numbers near the temple and can snatch food items. The trek to temple is ok but can be tiring during in summer months."
Excellent view must visit once..,"This temple is part of the Ranthambore fort had a great feeling after visiting temple. View is very beautiful from the place worth a treck to temple, but the peace of mind u get once you reach the top, its priceless!!"
Nice place,"Place of historical importance, one of it's kind temple where Ganesh ji is with his complete family, Ridhi Siddhi and shubh laabh"
"Don't miss it, best place to visit.","If you are in Ranathambhaur then you must visit.We had our own vehicle but parking is about 5 kms away. From main gate or parking point  You need to walk 5 kms or take sharing jeep for another 3 kms. But even though you have  to climb and walk for another 2 kms. Many monkeys are on the way but they don't harm anyone. Sharing jeep are not comfortable because the push more than 10 passengers in one jeep. They charge ₹ 15/- per passenger. You can hire a reserved jeep taxi by paying ₹150/- which will be more comfortable. After reaching at temple, you will feel relaxed and blessed."
"A spritual place, Lord Ganesha's old temple","Almost 200 Stairs & 2 KM walking. If any one has problem in climbing on Knee trouble, Please not go there."
Must visit Trinetra Ganesh ji Temple,"You drive your car to the Ranthambore fort parking but you should be a good driver otherwise take share jeep from the gate (5 km) You have to walk 1.5 kms up in the stairs inside the fort to reach the temple, nice experience"
Great temple,We went by early morning 6.30am . And climb the fort . It was a good walk and Mr. Manoj took care of us. Fort is really big and a trip has to be arranged if one is there in the city. A great history and it’s importance of fort is also mentioned.
Worth visiting,"Inside Ranthambhore Fort, this is the biggest attraction. Most people visit the fort for this temple. A number of monkeys around. They don't trouble you unless you do anything stupid. The arrangement for visitors is no different than any other similar Hindu temple. Look out for monkey art along the way similar to one attached."
Active small temple ,"I enjoyed the small temple. We could enter, pray & receive blessings from the monks inside. It was Totally decorated for the all night solstice celebration on the day we visited. It’s worth going inside."
Nice quaint temple inside the Fort,"We visited here during visit to Ranthambore Fort. The temple is a rather long walk from the entrance and is part of the fort. The temple is nice, peaceful and calm, and the exterior walkways are hounded by tame monkeys. A must visit place if you are visiting the fort. It is said that the statue of deity here is completely natural."
"Great view, high devotion","The temple is located at the top of the Fort, which offers great view of the mountains and Fort. There is great devotion associated with this temple."
Not bad,"The location is good inside the fort , the way to the temple is good. Enjoyed the fort more than the temple."
good,must go place. one should plan properly accordingly time.u should carry ur water while going there.
Jai Trinetra Ganesh,"The only temple of Lord Ganesh in the whole world where he resides with his whole family and also he has that third eye on his forehead.Located inside the Fort of Ranthambore, one has to climb almost 50-70 steps to reach the temple, but if you hire a guide, the tales of the bygone era and of the battles,  kings, queens, betrayals, raids and bravery, would keep u enchanted and you would never feel lethargic.But you also get a ""Palki service"", for those who really have a problem but they charge Rs 2000 for this.The temple is a small one and has no great architecture. We offered our prayers and I was glad to finally witness the place whose stories have been told to me since my childhood, one of them being that the first card of Marriage is sent to this temple to invite Ganeshji to bless the wedding.The delight point of this temple were the many langurs playing around. They dnt harm you. But if u have food n flowers, they would try to have a go at them. Dnt b scared. Just buy the Chanas from the local sweet shop and throw it on the ground and feel glad to see how the army of these black faced and long tailed monkeys fight it out for their share.It was fun to play with them!!!"
Nice though plan for time,Very nice temple. It is situation in the fort. Requires some effort to reach though. About 250 steps and a long walk in the fort. Keep about 2 to 2.5 hours to so this leisurely. Also watch out for monkeys. They are everywhere and can snatch anything in hand. Gives great view of the tiger reserve from the top of the fortTemple is neat and clean with no fuss. Small stalls there to serve tea and snacks.
So many monkeys! ,Highly recommended. Beautiful walk and so much wildlife. If you want to see monkeys come here. Stunning 100 year old fort. No other westerners to be seen. There are some small shops at the top of the hill. Bathroom facilities exist. There are rubbish bins but the monkeys steal from them. Would not recommend leaving anything not biodegradable in the bins. The locals were amused to see us and a few groups asked for selfies with us. Entry is free and parking is nominal fee (I think 5 rupees.) Not wheelchair friendly (cobblestone path.)
Overrated Temple but good hike through fort,The temple is located on the top end of the Ranthambore fort premises and is about a half and hour hike from the main entrance. We had gone in a group of 41 and the seniors in the group were really interested in seeing the temple. It's a beautiful walk through the fort ruins and…
My Ganu Baba,It is a historical temple . The property is now a world heritage site on the Arravalis . It is like a short trek up and down . For those who are unable to climb up can go up in a palki . The place is inhabitated with cute civilised monkeys who are waiting to snatch flowers and…
Nice place,Nice place to visit... a few steep stairs to climb although... and the surroundings were a bit dirty... but the religious fervour and sentiments of visiting the deity of lord Ganesh trinetra overpowers everything else... all in all a must see...👍
The Old Fort,"The fort is old and very difficult to navigate. Climbing skills are a necessity. The fort is very high and many, many steps to get there."
A Holy Place To Visit..!!,Trinetra Ganesh temple is situated at the last part inside the Ranthambore fort. One feel very sacred while visiting this temple. It is the biggest Trinetra Ganesh temple in Rajasthan. There are lots of monkeys and Langoor outside the temple but they will never bother you. This…
"Not well maintained, just go to visit the temple!",Nothing much to do other than trek your way to the temple! The fort around it isnt well maintained and nothing else to do there.
The activity of pilgrimage and devotees is terrible to the wild life.,"Often the devotees and casual visitor offers edible stuff to the Langoors,birds, cows and others which is not their natural food. The hoard like beggars for free food. This is terrible."
Pretty tired walk all the way up and Nothing interesting ,The place is beautiful worth to go the view is very beautiful from the fort you can see all the century nice atmosphere the temple was ok Nothing interesting
Ganesh Temple@ranthambore,"the temple is the last part of the ranthambore fort visit. we paid 800/-for the jeep ride. driver will wait for u in the parking lot.you can take a guide / proceed on your own. the temple site has lots of monkeys due to stores selling flowers and food. walk confidently and do not keep phone in your hand, you will be fine."
Ganeshji Darshan with aweosme Sunset views from the top!,"If you are visiting Ranthambore during Oct to Feb months then, suggestion is to finish the Safari in the morning & start your walk from the car parking around 3.30pm to 4.00pm. You are going to enjoy awesome sunset views & have some nice clicks. Carry water bottles for a walk if you are with family because you will only get something near the temple at the top. There are lot of other attractions too like the Rani Mahal, Jain Mandir, Kali Mata mandir along the way. Do explore all & if you like you can get a guide. Must try the stone homes as you will see lot of them & you will get interested but you cant break to build yours. You have to find the stones & place.Beware of Monkeys near the Ganesh temple specifically if you are carrying food items & prasad while return. Make sure its there in the bag or give it to the guide as they can help & are used too."
Worth the hike! ,"The Ganesh temple is situated inside tge ranthambore fort, and u need to hike a bit to reach there. Once you reach, u will see that its the temple where Ganesh ji lives with his family, and there is a belief of people making stone houses outside the temple, to ask for a happy…"
Different,"Had to be visited whilst in the locality, would recommend the guide, he will help you with the history and actually having a go worshiping in the temple the monkey are amazing by the way!"
Ganesh Temple,An ancient temple of Ganesh within the Fort. A long walk from the entrance of the temple but well worth it with its lovely views of the National Park with crocodiles basking in the sun.
Interesting fort to walk up to. Shame about all the litter!,Walked up to the top of the fort . Some dramatic walls ramparts and scenery ...but appalling litter everywhere! The Ganesh temple floor  was covered in rubbish....and you were asked to take your shoes off! Not a temple of interest to the tourist...but obviously sacred to the…
Hilltop divinity!,"If you like hiking, climbing, walking, you must go! We spotted more animals enroute to the Ganesh Temple than we saw in the national park. :) Like crocodiles, samba deer, chinkara, peacocks, etc.  The mandir is crowded! Good to visit while at Ranthambore though."
Great walk,Be prepared to walk up to a glorious view of sunset...It is worth it. Plenty peacocks n birds of different names. Be careful of the squirrels though as they are just hopping around. Watch ur step.
Interesting and Different!,"On the top of the imposing Ranthambore fort amidst the forests is the ‘Trinetra Ganesh Temple’. We preferred taking the car in till the parking while we saw locals walking. This fort stands impressively atop a hill overlooking the entire park and the view gets better and better as you go up. The fort has seven gates to cross before one reaches the top to the temple. Many animals and birds could be seen at the eye level, specially monkeys, langurs and peacocks. Best to visit in the morning hours. It would take some time and effort climbing up but totally worth the efforts. Some sign boards also show information from history. The place is well maintained.We got to know some interesting facts about this temple –1. The idol has three eyes and has appeared on its own.2. It is believed that if you make a house with stones in front of the temple, you will soon have a house of your own. And there are actually many such houses there. We built one too.3. In many castes in India, the first wedding invitation card is usually sent to this temple to invite lord Ganesha and seek his blessings."
The only temple in India of Ganesh ji with 3 eyes.,This temple sits atop of Ranthambor forte. One has to climb about 250 steps to reach the temple. It is only in this temple that Ganesh ji is seen with his whole family - 2 wives named Riddhi & Siddhi and 2 sons named Shubh & Labh.
Long trek upwards,It is a long trek and there are lots of monkeys there. Once up you will feel good and the views are also nice from multiple places while climbing up.
nice temple,its nice and peaceful and beautiful temple. we need to cross approx 250 setps to reach at temple. Lots of monkeys are their.
Part of fort,The Ganesh temple is inside the ranthambore fort. Amazing view of the national park. It's very good and famous temple.
The only Trinetra Ganesh Temple in India,"This Ganesh MAndir is more than 700 years old and famous in entire Rajasthan. The first invitation for all the marriages is being sent to this temple for inviting lord Ganesha so that entire celebration completed without any hurdle. On the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi a huge fair celebrated in this temple in which more than 5 lakhs person visit this place. Near the temple you can see the monkey, parrot and other birds."

Nice temple,A vey nice temple located on the top of fort. You need to climb many stairs to reach at temple. An amazing location with many waterfall. Site of jungle can be seen from fort.
Fort Temple,It is temple inside the Temple and is revered by local folks. It is good up hill walk to the temple but worth the effort.
Revered by locals,"The temple is located in the heart of the Fort. You have to climb a lot to get to it. But, on the way, you will realize it is revered by locals. Bow your head & have the prasad. The outside of the temple has monkeys & langurs.If you've any kind of food in your hand, they'll try to snatch it from you. Right outside the temple, you can get refreshments as well as offerings for the deity."

Temple in Fort,This is famous Ganesh Temple which is part of fort inside national park ard 4-5 km walk (both side) inside fort  
"The fort, the colours, the people, WOW",Make sure you make the time to visit the fort and the temple. The views are spectacular the people are amazing
Old & renowned ganesh temple in ranthambore,The temple is located above the hills. it approx takes 1 hr to reach there. Good to walk in morning and evening. there are various other temples located on the way. The idol is different. Old Ganesha temple.
One of the ancient temples.,"It is located in the Khandar Fort itself. About 30 min walk, one has to climb 200 stairs to reach the temple, lot of monkeys around but they are friendly. A good place to visit."
must visit,climb and walk to the temple through the Ranthambore fort is an experience. Yes it is taxing to climb so many stairs but an experience in itself
Visit Ganesh Temple,After safari we visit Trinetra Ganesh temple  at Hill after climb so many stairs it was very wonderful experience to visit the ranthambore Fort and Ganesh Temple
Worth a visit,Ganesh temple is one of the very few places to visit in Sawai Madhopur after the National Park. So do visit once you are here in town. It has a steep climb up the fort and you will find a lot of langoors near the temple. So do not carry and stuff in your hand as there is good possibility that it might be snatched. Try to keep  your hands free while you are here. Good thing that you will find many people on your way offering free water.
Different Idol as compared to other Ganesh idols in india,You have climb for around 50 minutes to one hour. The idol is quite different. There are ancient structures on top representing the kingdom. Overall nice 2/3 hours outing in between the jungle sufaries.
Temple,"The drive up the valley to the temple was lovely. The fort is very impressive, and there is a beautiful view at the top looking over the National Park."
divine with spicing of heritage,The visit to the temple is done with the visit to the Ranthambore fort . the entry has to be done before 5 pm. lot of climbing required but if you do not hurry it is enjoyable . lot of langurs are there and they try to snatch the prasad from you when you return after the Darshan in the temple.there was no rush at the temple .the scenery around the temple was breath taking.
Must visit place,"Temple is located inside the Ranthambore Fort and is one of the top attraction in Ranthambore. Feels nice once you get the Darshan. Lot of monkeys around, and you can feed them ( friendly once )"
divinity atop the mountain,"you need to climp up to reach the ganesh temple in ranthambore which is really revered. on a cool day, the walk itself is quite rewarding. must visit."
Jai Shri Ganesh Ji Maharaj,"Ganesh Temple is inside the Ranthambore Fort, it will take a approx 30-40 mins from the bottom to reach the main Temple , but it was always worth to visit Ganesh Temple, beware of monkeys at the template if you have small kids with you.  Ganesh Temple inside Fortress in Rajasthan is a tradition."
Send an Invitation Letter to Lord Ganesha at Trinetra Ganesh Temple,if you have any auspicious function in your home you can send invitation letter to Lord Ganesha at the address of Trinetra Ganesha Temple in Ranthambore. Every letter is opened and placed in front of the idol of Lord Ganesha. We used to pray Lord Ganesha before starting anything auspicious but this temple is the only place on earth where you can invite Lord Ganesha to attend your auspicious occasion. This is really an amazing and the only temple of Lord Ganesha with having three eyes. If you visit here you will feel an amazing vibe of spirituality inside you. If you are in Ranthambore must visit this temple which is located at the entrance of the Ranthambore Fort inside the National Park.
Inside Ranthambore fort,The ganesh temple is inside the ranthambore fort which is a world heritage site. The fort is itself magnificent and the temple lies in the far end of the fort which was a pleasant journey.
Steep walk but worth it!,We happened to go during a festival. The view from the top of the fort is amazing. There are also monkeys everywhere! There were little shops at the top where you could buy trinkets at local prices. Not sure if that is an everyday occurrence or just during festivals.
Family tour,"An excellent alternative to the Safari's offered in the park . Amazing views of the national park enroute the temple once inside the fort ,this temple uniquely receives the first wedding invitation from the entire region and has a large delivery of wedding cards daily to lord ganesh. Also the annual parikrama is performed by thousands . However this is a bad time to visit certain routes in the park that have masses of people walking towards and around the fort which means you will most likely see nothing in terms of wildlife sighting in those areas"
Olad is gold,Very good traditional mandir at swai madhapur you reach there by a car and there ranthambor century this is old mandir
Great find,This is a really well known temple with people coming from all around.  We organised to go up with a guide and met so many locals going up or making a pilgrimage to the top.  We went into the temple and had a blessing.   An amazing place to get to see real Indian life.
Get ready for tracking ,It's a good and famous temple. A guide will try to make up lot of stories but I personally feel it is not much required. Difficult for elderly ppl and very young kids as lots of stairs need to climb to reach the top. On the way lots of places to see specially lake from above…
Ganeshji visit,"It's an only temple with entire Ganesh ji family. Ganesh ji , Ridhi and Siddhi, and Labh and Subh... Panditji is also very accommodating... But baware of Monkeys...."
Jai Ganesh Deva,Built by Hindu Rajput rulers of Ranthambore. It has Ganeshji with three eyes which is unique. You have to careful about monkeys.
Perfect honeymoon visit,Myself and my husband got the opportunity to visit this famous Ganesh Temple which is highly auspicious for newly weds to pray. 
Anicent temple at ranthambhore fort,This temple was so old and lot of monkey at the temple entrance gate so be careful with monkey and its a part of ranthambhore tiger reserve area so huge jungle we see from the height of Ranthambhore fort.
Ganesh Temple on the top of Ranthambore,this temple is on the top of ranthambore fort. You will have to climb stairs to reach on top. There are guides who charge 200 INR. Its worth to hire a guide as they give you background and stories of fort
memorable experience ,"it took more than an hour for a round trip walk up from the parking area through the fort to the temple. In the end, it wass certainly worthwhile,  as i personally felt a spiritual positive energy after visiting the temple, which reportedly is the most famous Ganesha temple in the entire state of Rajasthan. Fort ruins and wildlife sightings are a bonus when visiting this temple. Definitely a must do in Ranthambore."
Awesome Place to visit Must go,Its is awesome place for piece and very awesome weather on evening you must go to visit there is lots of temple form different different religious.there is lots of monkeys also........
Darshan for Ganshji,We visited  this temple after check out from Hotel. It's a nice place in Ranthambhore  Fort.This is the oldest Temple.
Beware of monkeys!,"Its a nice temple located just outside Ranthambore national park. You need to climb lot of stairs to reach the temple. Exhausting but worth it, if you are religious. But on the way you will find lot of monkeys beware of them and they snatch your cameras and wallets and food. Just keep on walking, don't look into their  eyes."
Nice place,Good place to visit especially in wintets and rains . Lots of tourist and this place actually gives jungle type feeling
An interesting climb,"This place is not for people for who are not physically fit, as it requires quite a climbing,  But it has an excellent view on top and each step is absolutely worth the trouble!"
Lovely drive,A high trek but loved it. we were the last allowed car to go in and the drive inside the jungle towards the temple was wonderful.
A good place to see,The Ganesh temple is located in the 3rd Zone of the Ranthambore National park. Its inside the fort on the hill top. The road to the fort passes through forest. The lake on the way to the fort is full of crocodiles and can spot the crocs on the way to the fort. There are plenty of peacocks in the fort and can click the pics with the peacocks.Its not suitable for senior citizens as have to climb the stairs to reach the fort.
Lovely setting,What spoils the who fort area is the amount of litter and graffiti everywhere. Quite an easy climb up to the top of the fort. Views are excellent and Ganesh Temple is amazing.
Temple in a fort,After climmbing about 200 steps you reach to the temple its pretty nice in the fort imagine how could a large fort like this above the hills with such large walls could have been made at that time .
For the religious minded,"This is a rare trinetra Ganesh temple. Right at the end of Ranthambhore Fort tour. If you are here, and are a religious Hindu, it is worthwhile visiting. The views of the battlefield and deep canyon are very nice. "
also known as chitthi wale ganesh and havving third eye,"Very auspicious place of ganesh temple having third eye and very auspicious on the hill , having a nice walk and palkis are also available"
The Tiger of Sawai Madhopur,"A great park spread over 1334 square KMs, inhabited by hundreds of cheetals, sambhars, peacocks, crocodiles, reptiles and multitudes of birds. And of course 63 tigers. Even if you don't locate the tiger, the drive through in itself is a pleasure. The Ranthambore Fort and the…"
Nice,This a nice place in Ranthambore fort and it is nice for trekking and amazingly made the experience is awesome
Good Temple,Good place to visit on the top of the fort. It has great views and loads of langurs. You can get the prasad and flowers outside for offering.
So pretty,"Our first time to this temple of Ganesh ji, Riddhi ji and Siddhi ji. The climb to the temple is beautiful. once we reached the temple, we were scared of the monkeys snatching food. We didn't buy the prasad (laddoos- an offering to gods). We also saw rats crawling over all the food they were selling up there, so just decided to not buy.The darshan (viewing of gods) was smooth and easy. I would love to go there again if I am ever in Ranthambore. In general we found the area clean."
dilapidated inspite of being labelled World Heritage site,Typical apathy of Indian Govt to such Monuments . This received World Heritage Tag and Govt forgot about this place ! Poor signage
Good experience ,Must visit1 km walk on stairs and plain ground 25 minute walk from the parking Help and assistance available for elderly people (carriers)Not wheel chair friendly but carriers available at a nominal chargeLots of friendly monkeys on the way
Only temple with 3-eyed Lord Ganesha,"It is the only temple which boasts of having ""triNetra Ganesh ji"" Walk and stairs of almost 1 km - it would take upto 25 minutes to reach from parking - Lots of friendly monkeys on the way Great experience - must visit"
Jai Shree Ganesh,"Trinetra Ganesh Temple on top  the fort, need to climb on foot almost 3 kilometer up and down, lots of decent monkeys to see, temple is too old and worth a visit, I was lucky to visit."
Good Temple,Thgsi temple is at the top of Hill. Many temples in the complex. Its inside the fort and has lot of stories attached to it.
Nice temple but beware of langoors,beautiful location of temple inside the fort. Nice view around. was not too overcrowded when we visited.
Chamatkari Temple,"The 3 eyed Ganesh idol that seems to be a Syambhu as per myth is 6500 years old. The temple though is infested with Langoors outside that cause a havoc. Avoid carrying eatables openly for the risk of being attacked. The temple claims to fulfil the wishes of the devotees who build stone houses with pebbles on the path to the temple, but the journey is arduous and is above the fort"
Praise be the lord,"Atop the Ranthambore Palace, this temple is very popular.A climb of 270 odd stairs, slowly and gradually we made it.Enjoyed the view and the serenity."
Temple above tiger reserve,Easy enough to get to but not for less than fitLot of monkeys who do not interfere unless you have food in your hands. Better to keep away if you do not like them or are afraid of them.
Lovely morning walk up to temple,Went early in the morning to visit the temple.  Lovely walk up lots of stairs to a stunning view over the forrest and lake.  While there visit the Shiva linga in a small cave as well.  The monkeys love to eat the garlands there so be aware and surrender them quickly
Serves as an adventure as well as holy trip,Covers both aspects.a nice long trek as well as we get to see plenty of temples on way to the top to see the main Ganesha temple.on the way plenty of langurs so just be careful .take water along if conditions hot as a steep walk is in store for you.
Ranthambore area,"We had an interesting ,if somewhat bumpy Safari into the beautiful park but the tigers are very elusive! If you want scenery this is the area to visit . If you want to see tigers go to your local zoo.  If you visit the beautiful Ganesh temple beware of the monkeys!,"
Inside of Ranthambore fort,"The Temple is situated in fort on top & location is good to see the some part of the fort ,also there is refreshment facility with Peacock and Black money all around but are safe until you are showing any eatable thing to them."
Cleanliness!! ,"Well, obviously the temple itself is revered and beautiful! But like most temples, the cleanliness outside is abysmal and the hordes of monkeys are threatening."
Small Temple,Ganesh temple is inside the Ranthambhore national park area. It is a very nice statue of lord Ganesha.
We went there in winter .. it's an beautiful place to visit,A heritage temple in the national park its about 1000 years old ...and a good place for trekking. With an amazing view from the top. Beware of monkeys..
No separate visit required if you are visiting the fort,"The Ganesh temple is a ordinary temple situated inside the Fort area and more of a attraction for the locals. The Langoors are a major nuisance too both the fort as well as the temple, wish the management could do something about it."
Ganesh,"If you are a follower of Lord Ganesh and send all the wedding and birth invitations to Ranthambore, this needs to be visited. You need to walk a steep step and also negotiate with the monkey's in the vicinity but is an experience."
Temple called as Tri Natree Ganesh Ji,Very old temple...almost more than 1000 yrs old.. You can see lot of langoors outside temple. You can give them chana & they come without hurting u and eat from your hands
Must Visit,"This is the Ganesha Temple situated inside the tail end of the Ranthambhore Fort at Swaimadhopur.Visit to Ganesh temple is more of tracking then religious. After a long walk, mesmerizing beauty of the lake and forest below and remains of fort, visit to temple is the mind freshening thing."
Heritage Temple- 4th century,Its on huge height and make you tired and after that you could not go anywhere else.But good place to watch and do puja of Lord Ganesh-Without Trunk . Its a Fort of Hamir Dev
Ancient Ganesha Temple,"This is the Ganesha Temple situated inside the tail end of the Ranthambhore Fort at Swaimadhopur. This temple is one where Tri-netra (With three eyes) Lord Ganesha is seen with family, he is accompanied with Ridhi and Sidhi. A must visited place for tourists."
Jai Ganesh,"Visit to Ganesh temple is more of tracking then religious. After so many steps, mesmerizing beauty of the lake below and remains of fort, visit to temple is the mind freshening thing. The purity of air and darshan of god gives you soothing effect."
A historical and holy place - must visit,The Ganesh Temple is the most popular place to visit in Sawaimadhopur (Rajasthan). This is situated in the middle of Ranthambhore Durg.
Holy Visit!!!,"Good climb from parking lot and there are many temples but the Trinetra Ganesh Temple is where the devotees are heading.Guides can be hired too and for those who cannot climb, palkies are there to helpWas not crowded on Friday when we were there so we had a good darshanSmall eateries outside temple to help you satisfy the hunger pangs!!!Jai Ganesh!!"
A temple located in a fort,Another must see place at Ranthambore. Climbing on through the fort on Steep hill is really exciting and really a memorable event.
good time pass to go on the top of the hill.,its a good experience to go on the top. most of the parts of fort not open for visitors. jain temple is also mid way. be careful of monkeys while going to temple. beautiful view from the top as well as in between.
Nice experience,"Though the local people made me uncomfortable because I am heavy yet it was worth watching ,the mesmerising idol of Lord Ganesha made my day."
Nice old temple in the huge FORT,This temple is located in the Ranthambore National Park. Approachable road is very scenic and adventures. As it is located in the FORT so you have to walk or climb some km. Lot of moneys around the temple so keep safe your belongings. Must see place in Sawai Madhopur.
Do visit,3 eyed shree ganesh idol is unique. This exist inside the ranthambore fort. You have to walk at least 1.5 Kms including atleast 200 stairs. Do take a guide who will explain you about the history of the fort and the temple.
Only Ganesh Temple were Lord Ganesha is sitting with his whole family,The Ganesh temple is at the top of the Ranthambore fort. There is a very old  temple of  lord shiva. Must to visit
Nice temple,Temple was nice ...inside the fort. And the monkey over thr were so nice...so nicely they eat from your hand and doesn't trouble you.
Great place to visit ,Lovely views and a well presented and renovated Fort.  Beautiful views but beware of monkeys.  But forget a the hullabaloo and just go up for a visit.  
Highly Overrated ,"This place is within the fort, but not a part of the original structure. It is a plain building with no descriptive beauty. The structure is surrounded by stalls owned by flower vendors, Prasad sellers, Puja samagrihi sellers etc. Moreover this place is infested by monkeys -…"
A beautiful monument,"If you love history and architecture, please do not miss a visit to Ranthambore Fort. It is completely overshadowed by the Tiger Reserve though it deserves much better.  There are several pols (gates) you pass on your climb into the fort.  The design and beauty of the fort and…"
Worth a trip,"It is up the Ranthambore fort- worth a visit for the enjoyable trek up the hill. The temple itself is nothing spectacular or unusual. Avoid carrying sweets or eatables as this can attract monkeys, although they dont do any harm usually."
renowned temple,if you are religious you should definately visit it once. place is not well maintained though it is inside the fort and declared heritage property still not good. thats the sad part of India. otherwise nice. its a bit far so wear sport shoes bcoz u have to walk a lot to go and…
Trinetra Ganesh Temple,"Situated at the end of Ranthambore fort, it's a long hike to the temple. Surrounded by may be a ton of monkeys, they stare right at you, making a poker face. Try not to take any eatables in front of them, surely will get snatched. A peaceful place it is, being a hindu devotee it…"
Best thing in Ranthambore - Trinetra Ganesh Temple,"It is a lovely journey through the forested road to the base of the fort from where the climb up to the temple starts. The walk up the fort to the temple is amazing with beautiful views and the darshan of the Trinetra Ganeshji is unforgetable. Not to mention the lovely Kachoris,…"
Good trek,Temple was situated on the hills after the ranthambore fort.  Good to many monkeys on the way.  Beware of monkeys when carrying food items with you. Enjoy the gypsy ride to the base of the temple. 
A Temple in Core area of Tiger Reserve,"The best panoramic & scenic way of 5 KM to the temple and that is from the one of the most core area of National Park. This Temple is a part of Ranthambore fort and the fort is also having Shiv Temple, a Maszid, and many more ruins of fort along the way."
Great,Being a devout hindu I liked it and visoted the ganesha temple better you should have guide for you if kids are accompanying you else was a great experience
40 minute trek to the temple but worth it,This temple is situated on top of Ranthambore fort and it is a 30-40 minute trek. Best time to do the trek is early morning or late evening as it was get really hot during the afternoon. 
Ganesh temple,Extremely commercial; nothing spiritual about the place. It's a newly made structure with no aesthetic value or beauty
Beautiful and must visit religious place,"After climbing about 400 steps and some distance around beautiful lake and monument, you will be delighted to see this marvellous temple. Beautiful inner campus, blessing Lord Ganesh and deleciuos Laddu  Prasad ..every thing will give you a feeling of satisfaction. There are a…"
Climb up through ancient fort for Darshan,It is one of the most famous Ganesh Temples in the region. Situated at top of the ancient fort built on a mountain. It is said that it is very auspicious to invite Swaimadhopur Ganesh ji as first guest in marriage :) Also said that those who are not getting married must do his…
Peaceful temple in a nice fort,"It's a small, peaceful temple is situated inside Ranthambore fort which itself is in the Jungle. There is not much architecture or grandeur here. But, it's very famous among believers.  There are around 225-250 steps (easy steps) and then 1/2 - 1 km walk inside fort. Walk is…"
Famous Ganesh Mandir ,"Visited while end of Rajasthan tour, located at Ranthambore Fort, there is few more temple in near by place, Ganesh mandir has timings for visit inside,"
Bizarre temple!,"While visiting Rathambore fort, our guide took us to the Lord Ganesh temple. It isbrightly colored and overwhelmed by monkeys!  You must remove your shoes to enter the temple.  If you are lucky you will see a brightly made-up holy man nearby."
very old fort base temple in india,"this place only for strong leg and strong heart but if you visit it , you think that  it will be unforgettable memory."
Interesting...,"Not worth the trip...stop to visit if near-by. Not much to see around the temple. If lucky a tiger may stroll by. Lots of antilopes, deers, monkeys, pigs, crocodiles nearby and around the temple."
Very Beautiful Place!,This is a very beautiful place and is situated in the Ranthambore national Park. Private vehicles are allowed there to visit and is a must visit place in Rajasthan! Best time is winters.
Nice ..watch out for langur,"It is 15-20 min walk from the park gate. Be prepared to walk some steep stairs and pavments. you will sight many langur's on the way and for most part they are harmless, but you need to be careful if they see you carrying food.The temple is beautiful and we did not have to wait in a que to get in.. i am told that there are looong ques to get in during festivals. Th temple is famous for Ganesh Idol which has three eyes.. the only place in the world.( to be validated, as told by the tour guide). But just go there for the lords blessing. The lake view from the top is amazing and we worth the climb."
Typical Temple,"The surroundings are the things that will make the trip worth remembering. The temple as it is, is nothing worth mentioning. Though this is known to be a very religious place in the entire country."
Busy due to Diwali but still great to see,Quite a climb to the top but the views make it worth it. We had a guide who was able to give us the history.
Nice place with 64 steps,Located inside ranthambore fort you have to climb 64 steps and walk around 1.5 km inside fort to reach
Devine place to visit,It will take around 20-30 minutes climb/ walk to reach the temple. The temple is in the fort. And to reach the fort you have to go either in private car or hire a car (ricks not allowed). You can take share Jeep available at station. If you take a hired care it's very costly. You can try to merge the temple with Safari but you will have to walk atleast 2-3 km in jungle to reach the fort.
Gorgeousness,Pure gorgeous ruins within the fort. This one has a gorgeous and intricate gate. Best time to go is early morning.
Worth going,"The fort is gorgeous during early morning. Lots of langurs near the Ganesh temple. Be nice to them, they don't harm."
Temple in a Fort,"The temple is located in the Ranthambore Fort.  Getting to the Fort requires a moderately difficult climb of about 300 steps from the parking lot at its base.  This 5th century fort built by King Hammir, is the second largest, the largest being Chittorgarh.  There is very little…"
Very very quaint and a must do for the cultural experience,take off your shoes and join the devoted.  WE loved this temple and got blessed when we went there. You can buy inexpensive ganesh's for gifts too.
Temple & Fort Ruins definitely worth a visit,The fort & temple at Ranthambore are quite magical. It's a very steep clime of 350 steps up but worth the effort. The views over the national park are breathtaking if the the remains of the fort don't impress you. But its a good rambling walk trying to conjure up what a…
The tiger temple,The temple is situated inside the fort in the midst of the tiger sanctuary. The place is very much scenic and surrounded with troops of monkeys and herds of birds
Nice place,Ganesh temple is at hill and surrounded by ranthambore forest. Only temple of Lord Ganesha with whole family in India.  Many longoors are around the temple.
Very good place ,"To reach this place,  it takes atleast 20-30 by foot on stairs.  Nice view from the top.  You visit ganesh temple which has priests and can buy prasad also there.  Great place worth a visit. "
Interesting,Lovely collection of temples along with the famous Ganesh temple. There are 2 Shiv temples & a Kali temple too. Felt really nice & better to go early mornings.
Little far but worth,You need to trek a lot to visit this temple. Traffic problem is there so better park your vehicle down itself. Enjoy the pictures.
Spell bound! ,The fort and the temple are majestic! No words...Just some unique dip in unexplored history! Recommended for cold weather..
Must visit,It was a great expectations to be there ! Temple is on ranthambhore fort !! Fort has a great history told by guides which I was available there !! Too many picture clicking spots overall nice place !! Must visit if you are at ranthambhore
"Dissapointing , Not scenic and vry tiering",First of all you gona get stuck in traffic jam. Den realy boring long walk. At last one simple temple. Not old architecture. Dissapointing
Ganesh temple,this temple is sure to be seen while you're in ranthambore. But please keep in mind that this resides inside a fort and that means a lot of walking up and down the big and wide concrete steps.
A must see!! ,"A beautiful view of Ranthombore can be seen from the top of the Ganesh Temple. We received a lovely Hindu blessing at the top and saw lots of monkeys. We hired a guide for 750rupees and he was worth every penny, without him we would have either gotten lost or not understood about the temple itself. Apparently when it is hottest most of the water reserves dry up and tigers will drink from the large water reserve visible from the top so sightings are very likely at the hottest times of the year. Absolutely stunning scenery, a lovely place to go whilst travelling from Agra to Jaipur!"
