HOLY VISIT,"Due to coronovirus, no rush. we can worship within an hour. os usual inside rush is there. there should be separate outgate. since for coming outside the temple also, heavy crowdy and rush. no proper measures taken"
cleanliness and maintenance of temple,"Its is the right example to the whole world for maintenance of religious temple. the queue maintenance is excellent. Every lack of pilgrims are visiting without any inconvenience. We can appriciate the TTD Trust to providing free meals to pilgrims without any confusion. Its a great, great holy place in the world."
Dev Darshan,"It was a nice and awesome place for dev Darshan,ye place ghumne ke liye bohot hi jyada accha hai,hum log online room booking bhe kar sakte hai but uske liye aapko 3months pehle room book karna hoga,and kisi ko waha pe ghumne ke liye travels chahiye hoga to mujhe contact karo,waha pe meri pehchan wala 1 aadmi hai jo aapko saste mai sab places ghuma dega..."
Visit to Tirumala temple,Visiting Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala has become more comfortable with new facilities. Now you can expect the darshan is completed within 2 hours on a normal day in Rs 300 category. Waiting and handling of pilgrims has become much better.
Mr.,I visit Tirumala temple almost every 2 years. Excellent management. Booked darshan ticket online @Rs 300/- per Head. Earlier we had one issue that Shoes have to deposited near entry of temple and exit is different side. So one needs to go back again to collect the Shoes. Now TTD has made arrangements so that shoes can be taken back near exit and this saves time and hassles.
Good ,Good tour very nice and peaceful. Aptdc has the best tour option for all. The rates are the best and cheap.the comfort is better than any other mode.
Nice,It is a very devotional place and visitable place with out hesitation.those who have not visited tirumala. They have lost the opportunity to see such a wonderful place
Srivani Trust VIP darshan,"We had booked Rs 10000 VIP break darshan under srivani trust scheme. Three people visited. Our reporting time was 6.15 AM in the morning. We reached at 5.45 AM. As we had the VIP tickets, the police allowed our car near VQC 1 for drop off. There was a que and about 100 people were there. Our tickets and ID were checked properly. After walking for 5 mins we were made to sit in a compartment. They served us Coffee and Milk. It was very good. AT about 7 AM pongal was served which was tasty. At about 7.25 AM we were allowed for darshan and the line started. Our tickets were checked again. By 8.15 we were near the sanctum. We went inside and had a very close darshan of Lord Venkatesa. We had goose bumps and my mother was very happy and moved. we gradually entered the sanctum in line and we went very close to the god, just 3 feet away. We never had such a experience in life. We appreciate TTD for such an initiation."
Lord Venkateshwara Temple - Best !!,"One of the or may be the most famous South Indian Temple, Tirupati located on hills of Tirumala house of Lord Venkateshwara is a very good temple where daily thousands and lakhs pilgrims visit. There are many ways to book to enter the temple to view or get Darshan of Lord Venkateshwara and all options are available online. It is compulsory that online reservation / booking is done prior to get specific date for Darshan. There is also another way for Darshan if online booking couldn't be done which is directly proceed to foothills of Tirumala and climb the hills by steps. One way is 9km long and the other ways is about 3km long but is steep to climb. It generally takes about 2 hours to reach the main temple after you have started your in your line as per the given time slot. In the main temple is Lord Venkateshwara. After Darshan as per your ticket you are entitled for the world famous laddus here. They are very unique.Please remember before you start your line for Darshan of Lord Venkateshwara please visit the Varsha Swamy Temple first and take bath in the Holy pond. Also please wear only traditional clothes here.In the picture I here is shown the main temple. Inner most building is real gold plated.Lord Venkateshwara bless all."
Tirumala kalahasti visit,"After the night shift, vignesh came to trtr and called me at 7.30 morning. I have also packed my bag and we headed towards ekm railway station. Banglore express 12678 have arrangements for our travel. We started on time. Nature of the land scape change as it crossed wadakkencherry n ottapalam. We have come to the rural agricultural areas of Malabar. Rolls of dry grasses after cultivations, cows goats and birds involved in their daily news update. Cranes stand still as white clothes are laid on these fields. As if they check the law and order among them. Crossed the walayar and ghat section it is completely masked by the tall rocky structures of the Western Ghats. Reach salem. Vivekananda bar behind joy Alukkas. From salem railway station need to get bus to new bus station. Got the setc bus to tirupati. The bus was in perfect time. Facility in tirupati bus station for toilet and other morning purpose is very good. Next is to get the bus to sreevaru mettu. It is available from the railway station. There's no bus from tirupati bus stand before 7. An auto for 50/- Will take you to the exact bus station. It is walkable only. Bus is crowded. The roads are extremely good. We can stand and sleep with out any bumpers. Bus will drop you at the luggage center. You will get free rooms right there. Take money mobile and keep footwear inside bag and hand over. This will be carried through cargo to the top. Climb 2388 step. Steep climbing. Darshan token will be provided in the way as you climb the steps. Once you get the time to darshan you can manage the pace of climbing. If it is in the evening you can rest more and enjoy the scenery. Provide small helps to others. Reach tirumala temple place after all the steps. All toilet and social use facilities are extremely clear, clean and safe. I can never imagine walking barefoot in kochi. But here it is not an issue. It is very very very clean. Small trees are there which helps with its shadow to avoid the burns. There is ro filtered water every 100feet. No bottled water is provided. It is banned. Towards right you reach the prebooked darshan point. Towards left you can go to the divya darshan point which is given for sreveru mettu climbers. We had enough time for that. Anna prasadam center is huge Hall provide breakfast lunch and dinner according to the specified times. There's is big wall painting of tirumala. We have to take the tirumala bus. It is 4bus stop away. People will get in bus and will not move back. So take the hard way to get in(pushing and pulling). Luggage center is just at the exit of anna prasadam center. There's a shopping place where photo small statues and various ornamental things are available. Small food outlets are there. Reach the point and the grilled path will take you to darshan. That's a magical management by tirumala devaswam. Security check will be done before you move to the compartment. It is all a sequential process. One after the other. Enter in the compartment where need to wait. Darshan took almost 4hours wait. You can stand for approximately 10seconds after all the efforts. Pray and chant'govinda govinda'. After the darshan it will lead us to the laddu center.After the darshan sreevaru mettu climbers if they had dropped the luggage at the starting point you have to take the tirumala bus from the luggage centre circle to tbc point. Mobiles will be available at the normal luggage center.Get the tirupati bus back to town. It's full hairpin bends. In the night if you return take the right side seat. Towards the town its a beautiful view of city's light and houses like stars in the sky. Lot of accommodation facility at the bus station. Dwaraka is a 3star one. Hotel paradise is good for non veg. Most of the other hotels provide ac rooms around 1200-1500.Next day, Take the nonstop srikalahasti bus from tirupati stand. Enquiry is available at every 100m distance. This is another wonderful thing. Extremely satisfied with the experience by the employees. Their behavior and service. Srikalahasti, is not that crowded. If you are in hurry take the 200token. It is notified that mobile is not allowed but many take it inside. If you are able to, it's very good. There's a lot to fill in your gallery. Structure of the temple built on rock is fantastic. Breeze out side is very cool. Rahu ketu counter is outside on the way to gate 4. Anna prasadam center is there at the out after the darshan.We return to the bus stop. The pineapple juice from the shop at the stop is very good. Took the same bus back to room. Got the setc Coimbatore bus. Got the supaa travel to vytilla. Reach home.Om namo narayanaya.Om namah shivaya."
"A vibrant, lively spiritual place",We climbed the Alipiri Mettu to get here.  It was a surprise to find Tirumala to be like a small town rather than just a temple.  It even has its own bus stand and petrol station!.  We found it to be vibrant and freindly.
blessing to see the lord,"we had been to kodur to atttend a wedding, in the tirupati district.   we had booked the special darshan ticket online 3 months prior.  the lines are systematic  it gets very crowded near the diety. we cud complete our darshan in one hour. we got 10 seconds to see the lord.. we had the laddus and came out, very satisfying visit"
Blessings of Lord Balaji amidst spotless efficiency,"I had visited Tirumala for a wedding and took the opportunity to seek Lord Balaji's efficiency. I booked special darshan for Rs. 300 per head online in November 2019 through a spotlessly efficient process. Chose a 2 pm darshan and reported 10 minutes before. Darshan was done by 2.45 and we collected the laddus available as part of the darshan from the counter. Darshan was from outside but Balaji being large, we could clearly see him. We had booked a room, again through the online process which was again seamless from booking to allocation and cost 1k. The room was very spacious, modern and neat. We had free lunch at the Annaprasada center which was wholesome, hot and well organised. Tirumala reminded me of a Singapore or Geneva on the neatness(including public toilets) and staff efficiency front. There r free buses to move around at good frequency. Keep up the good work, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD)!"
Srivari Darshana ,"One of the Beautiful and Divine Place in the earth Once You get Darshana You feel Peaceful in the Soul , First visit Padmavathi temple in Tirupathi then Bhoo Varahaswamy Temple in Tirumala land Lord of Tirumala And Then Srivari This How We Have to visit to Tirumala for Darshana Om Namo Venkateseya 🙏🙏"
Om Namo Venkatesaya !,"Lord had given a good darshan.  I had travelled via Sri Vaari Mettu pathway, and had been given the timing at 3.00 pm. Entered the cage around 1.30 pm and the darshan was completed by 5.00 pm.  Since it was a Saturday, heavy crowd was there."
Divine Experience,The temple is situated on the top of Tirumala. We have taken online booking from TTD website (Rs. 300) per head. The visit was in January and we had to wait around 1 hour for the Darshan.
not worth the crowd,"The arrangement is great but the crows are huge too and if you opt to get sarvadarshan like I did, you may end up waiting for 8-10 hours even in non-peak time. so get a 300 Rs special darshan ticket else don't go."
Brief visit ,"A visit to the Temple  happens only when there is a call from the Lord himself and a connect establishes with our soul, thats the starting point. This is never a casual tick in the box visit. No amount of planning and perfection helps as its the God’s connect with you and his grace that decides your coming to the temple and having a good darshan of the Lord. Having said the above, please plan well to execute the visit. With complete divinity of purpose and focus, take a e darshan ticket and be on time at the gate with the id proof that was used for booking the ticket. Take a printout of the ticket. Once in the que, its destiny how long one needs to be in the line, depends upon the time of the year and whether its peak time or otherwise. For the 300 Rs online ticket, one can expect a wait time of 1 to 2.5 hrs normally. Feb is non peak. Be mindful of the attire. Need to completely attired head to toe with traditional indian attire and preferably in white dhoti (called Veshti) for men and women indian attire. No pants please. The darshan of the lord is ultimate connect of the Soul. Its so powerful and the vibes and the current it generates is unbelievable in the backdrop of the chanting noise of ‘Govinda, Govinda, Venkataramana,  Govinda, Srinivasa Govinda’ Be with the rhythm and the flow and submit with focus to the Lord. The brief face to face with the God is ultimate and life undergoes a sea change with a visit. Offer your prayers and His grace will be all over you for transformation and a new beginning. The Lord blesses you unconditionally in every visit. A satisfied inner fulfilling experience every time."
Serene and Divine,A beautiful place and very well managed. The temple premises is awesome. The whole process of darshan is seamless. A must visit place for everyone. May Lord Balaji bless us all.
Temple,"Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam is very beautiful to visit Lord of vishnu near Andhra Pradesh, India.."
Awesome,Here in tirupati you can enjoy alot.come along with friends gang and go to tirumala.youbguys will have a lot of fun.later after darshan go to thalakona and jungle book.also the beast places to see are shilparaman and chandragiri fort and science centre.
Well renowned mandir,It is a well renowned mandir in South India as well in whole of India. Must must visit for Hindus as it is a very good temple but too crowded specially on weekends
Jai Govinda!,"it was my first visit to Thirumala and I was overawed by everything I saw and experienced. Stayed at Tirupathi (Hotel Udaya International) and drove up to Thirumala hills for the darshan.The Darshan itself was wonderful however, the manner in which the pilgrims are literally put into a cage as they await their turn and the rude behavior of the staff with the poor pilgrims was something I could have done without witnessing at a pilgrimage site. But then a glimpse of Lord Venkateshwara made the journey worth the effort. Jai Govinda! and the chance to donate one's hair at Kalyan Katta to our Lord was once in a lifetime. A definite must visit - recommended that you book your special darshan tickets online at TTD Seva. Incase, it is an impromptu calling of the Lord, just make your way to the Srinivasam Complex at around 3 am and wait till the ticket window opens around 7 am to take your tickets. Only 500 tatkal tickets are issued per day so hurry and reach there early. Don't forget to carry your Aadhar Card without which you will not get the Darshan Ticket. With this Special Darshan Ticket, it will take you a maximum of 2 hours or so to get the Darshan."
Breath taking,Right from the first toll... the atmosphere just became spiritual and mind blowing!!The temple campus is managed so well and neat.. just fantabulous.... No words to explain the feelings at the time of the actual darshan of Lord Venkatesha !!
A beautiful walk uphill to Tirumala from Alipiri,"It's about 3500 steps uphill & almost 12-13km distance, If you are a sucker for nature its best for you walk your way to tirumala. you can find deer parks, lush green forest, food joints, waterfalls, deep valleys on your way up."
Walking uphill Alpiri way,The temple trek uphill is a great way to have darshan and a extended family comprising of 16 members from 14 to 70 years walked all the way. It was difficult but all enjoyed with good company. Had a delicious breakfast and waited for our turn for the darshan. After seeking the blessings of Lord and donating part of our earnings again has prasadam. It was a rather quick journey as we started at 6.00 AM and finished collecting our share of ladoos by 12.00 noon Happy to be blessed
My favourite temple,"My favourite temple, in Feb 2019 we had visited this temple for Kalyanotsavam & again in May 2019 for Sahasradeepalankarana seva on our twins birthday. Must visit temple at least once in our lifetime."
My annual visit to Tirumala Temple.,"I have booked kalyana seva of God Venkateswara & Padmavthi by advance booking. I also advance booked my accommodation on hills at Tirumala.I went in to line at 8am and checked my self with family and waited for seva inside the temple. We were allowed inside the temple by 10.15 am and made to sit. The Kalyanam started at 12 noon and concluded by 13.15. Then we were sent for darshan of God Venkateswara. We were given sesha vastram and after darshan we are asked to collect Laddu prasad. The rooms were super good and have hot water, have westren and India toilets. Hit water is available in the accommodation."
Templd,One of the most important temple in the locality. You will always find this place crowded as it is one of the most visited place
Must visit Temple,Any one will like to visit this temple but without any pre booking for free darshan you have to wait for 4-5hrs depending on rush.please book well in advance with any darshan slots by on line. Very peaceful and clean temple.govinda...govinda
Walk up to the temple,An excellent experience culminating in a minute of unhindered view of Lord balaji. These are memorable experiences of one's lifetime
Quick & peaceful Darshan! Jai Sree Balaji.,"Hi visitors, I am writing this reviews who are willing to darshan Sree Balaji temple but worried about the crowed. I visited on 13th November 2019 with my infant and aged parents. It took 1.5 hrs only. I booked sheeghra darshan ticket from their website. I followed some categories before choosing the date and time for darshanas I wanted to darshan peacefully. I avoided Brahmotsavam, Purnima, Ekadoshi, Dwadashi, weekends, any national holidays."
one day TTDC tamilnadu tourism development corporation trip from Chennai to Tirupati Temple,"I traveled with family on 24.12.19 from Chennai. Someone from office suggested me to go for TTDC for timely Darshan. So I got 4 tickets done for four of us(including my parents)through website and it was smooth. It cost 1850*4= 7400. Only thing is no ordinary/AC tour was available. Only three Volvo bus were there.(probably they do not do ordinary trip which may decrease their revenue, fair enough) It was mentioned to reach 30 mins prior to departure that effectively comes to 4.30 am. So plan accordingly. We at 4.30 am reached at TTDC office in Anna Salai, Chennai. Our bus no was 6868.(got a SMS from ttdc just previous night with bus no and details) Bus was nice and a guide was given to every bus. Bus was having a sound system for any announcement and was in good condition.On the way to Tirupati we were given breakfast at a restaurant which was of good quality. On reaching tirupati at 9.20, we were transferred to APSRTC bus since big buses would not be allowed on the route.On the way to tirumala, security checks were done. In tirumala near to temple they have a rented flat/cottage SN303 (Sahadri Nagar 303) where clothes can be changed, washroom is also available. Phones, cameras, chappal are not allowed in main temple. So pilgrims must leave it there. Now with guide all the people of a particular bus will proceed to special darshan temple queue of temple. From then on it is auto-pilot. You follow the queue and after going through many waiting halls and more queues Lord Venketeshwara will oblige you with Darshan. We got darshan at 3.30pm.After Darshan, the guide will meet you the shop right opposite to the main temple.(below Hanumananuman temple) Will give you 2 Laddus per ticket and lunch token. Then you can go for lunch and from there return to the cottage, as they say, SN 303. Phones which were collected before leaving cottage will be given to you. After all persons of a bus return, everyone with respective guide will move towards nearby bus stand where they were earlier dropped. An APSRTC bus will be boarded and it will drop you at TTDC bus down the hill. From here we will again proceed to Chennai.Now everything looks almost perfect except time taken in Darshan. Why is rating only average?I have to admit that as per planning and process it stands for 5 rating. But there is a lot to improve on people side.Especially the guides, they have very apathetic towards pilgrims and have a attitude of high-handedness. They sees tourist as cattle.They will try to speak over you, gag you. My mom was having difficulty walking. Instead of offering any help, he kept pestering us all along- suppose you don't return time, bus will leave. He got the other guides repeating the same stuff....you should have come through booking and all... (guess what we were the first from our bus to return to cottage and guide himself came after an hour.)Other one was mockingly asked my mom if she has a bomb in the belt to support her waist...such offending remarks! My guide even asked me some money for local expenses almost in the manner as if 1850 per person does not cover it. Though he added 'whatever you like to give' afterwards.My boss earlier told that they have some understanding with staff for priority queue and quick darshan. I did not notice any such thing.We were not taken to padmavathi temple as promised.The guide even tried his best to skip a meal/evening tea and directly took us to chennai. But because of few assertive ladies(whom the guide was blaming for delay in the trip), he had to provide us the dinner at the same place where we had breakfast, again very nice.Lunch token was given for a near-by restaurant which serves very avg food. So overall, it was five star on process management but 2 star on staff and people management to TTDC.PS: Don't forget to take the *hardcopy* of aadhar card.All 3-4 buses pilgrims will use same cottage for the same time. So you might feel a bit stuff.Prepare to walk a long stretch. Reconsider if you are not well and rather aged"
Temple Tirumalai ,Very good and excellent.. very old temple it has lot of memories attached to it .. had a very good time
This Temple is really amazing.,"Temple is very clean and excellent facilities are provided for the devotees. Recent addition of sevadals for crowd management and control seems to have eased the flow little as they do it as a seva, they dedicate themselves in their duty with a service mind. They have opened free prasadam around Tirumala which is amazing."
A Paradise on Earth - Holiest Place for Lord Venkateswara,"Here God answer your prayers. The nature is at its best. Temple is in hill surrounded by beautiful forest, architecture buildings of ancient India, rich satvik prasad, lot of convenience, a good treatment is provided for elders, youngsters, speciality peoples. A place makes you experience that Paradise existed before 3000 years. This temple is famous for laddus, so yummy and tasty. The laddus are believed to stay fresh for 10 days. In temple they offer delicious prasad like tamarind rice, curd rice, Pongal."
Nice and famous temole,Tirumala temple is famous not only in south but is verg famous all over in india. From very far people come for for praying and with their wishes.
Just feel it.. ,"This Temple is really an astonishing one in the world.. Every day around 20,000 to 50,000 people from all over India come here to offer their prayers and pray for their welfare.. Clean and excellent facilities are provided for the devotees and simply excellent work is done by people who are working here.. Actually, ""People work here "" - This phrase is not correct..To say really, ""People dedicate themselves in their duty"". Yes,  this is correct (in my view,  the service done by the people working in this Temple administration here is really incomparable).. You should first visit01. GovindaRaja perumal temple in the foothills of tirupati city.. 02. Then worship the kapileswarar temple and take a holy dip in the kapileswarar theertham  In the hills, 01. Varahasamy temple in the bank of pushkarani 02. Pray the hanuman Temple in front of the temple next.. 03. Then you should enter the line to worship Lord venkateswara.. Have a great Darshan and feel Blessed.."
Tirupati Balaji Temple - Excellent arrangement,The visit to the Temple has been very spiritual for me. Only if they would allow 10 seconds per person would be great. Right now one gets only 2 seconds per person.
Beautiful temple,"What a divine place , despite millions thronging the place . Credit to TTD for maintaining everything in the best possible manner"

Govinda!,"There's no set of words that can explain the experience. The beauty of the temple and fervor of the devotees to get a glimpse of Lord Almighty Venkatesh makes it a unique experience. This is the abode of My Lord, there's no other place in the universe like this.GLORY TO LORD VENKATESH"
Lord Venkateswara famous and popular temple,We have lots of faith in God and especially Tirumala is the best place to visit and Temple is very big and TTD follows the proper process to help the pilgrims. MUST VISIT place and temple in SOUTH INDIA.
One of the popular temple in south india,One of the richest amount of donations received and which is been used in the form of trust. Which is being given back to people in the form of service. The maintenance in and around the temple have improved a lot. And the darshan timings have come down due to good management.
WELL ORGANIZED DARSHAN FOR SENIOR CITIZENS,"The temple takes special care for visiting senior citizens, by issuing special pass up to 1000 nos a day. You are taken through a special enclosure and ensure you have darshan without much of pushing by other devotees. If you are an sr. citizen of 65 years and above, you should avail of this facility.Once you are inside in front of Lord Venkateshwara, you forget the world, and devote your time only at looking at Him! You will not even remember what you wanted to ask him. You know by seeing Him, you are taken care of the Lord himself, no need to ask for anything."
The abode of Lord VENKATESHWARA,"Even the fleeting glimpse of the The LORD, is enough to give a sense of peace and tranquility. The power of the LORD is such that in spite of the hardships one has to endure to see HIM, it all pales into insignificance.There are two ways to reach Tirumala where the temple is situated. One by road and the other climbing up the hills. Buses ply at regular intervals from Tirupati to Tirumala.  One can also use their personal vehicles. Tirupati is connected to all major cities by road and rail and air.Climbing up the hills takes around 4 hrs or more depending on the physical condition of the person.Online booking is available for Darshan as also various Sevas performed in the Temple.s"
Annual Family Pilgrimage,We have been visiting this temple since childhood days and over the past 15 years make a visit every year. The place provides an immense sense of peace and tranquility to all devotees and worshippers.
Pure Bliss & Serenity,"This was my first time to Tirupati & unlike all my fears on not being able to do Darshan beyond few seconds, I was positively surprised. Firstly the journey to the top of the hill was mesmerising, with cool breeze, many monkeys, sights of people walking up & amazing views of the town. Food stores were lined up around the premises. While we didn’t stay in the guest houses in the vicinity, they looked inviting. We had booked an advance online pass for Darshan & moved straight to the start of the line. Happy with the security & ticket/Id checks. For the large crowds that arrive here, the lines were reasonably well organised. Happy that there are separate lines for moms with young children, older & specially abled people. Electronics, arms, leather items are prohibited. Clothing has to be appropriate with no shorts, trousers, pants for men but dhoti or kurta pyjama & sarees or salwar/ kameez for women. After around 3 hours in winding lines with chants of Govinda Govinda, we reached the entrance of the main dome. Water flowing at the entrance washed our bare feet. Lines were well organised & volunteers kept of moving people ahead. Once we entered the main hall, the sight was invaluable. Beautifully decorated & adorned idol of Lord Venkateswara was visible far across the hallway. Just at the opposite end was a smaller idol of the lord decorated with flowers. Chants filled the room & it was heavenly. Once out of the room, we got Prasadam of Pongal rice, some others got tamarind rice & some luckier ones got jaggery-rice. We took the Prasad of boondi laddus (stuffed with tasty cardamoms) & walked out of the premises feeling blissfully blessed......Excellent service & staff."
Divine Experience,"Away from the hustle of the work, sometimes you should plan to be in touch with the super natural power which created all of us. Whenever I am at this temple I feel the same. I feel God is very near to us and thus it is a must visit for me. Although I want to visit this place as frequently as possible, however these days it is happening once in an year. MUST VISIT IF YOU ARE IN TIRUPATI"
Bhramhotsava,"I had visited the Tirupati tirumala devasthanam in October during my birthday,as it was a yearly bhramhotsava days.The place gives you a peace of mind and the weather is also good during that time"
Divine place to visit!!,"Divine place to be visited. One of the most popular and beautiful temple. Located in Tirupati, Andhra pradesh. Pilgrims donate their hair to lord Vishnu and goddess Neeladri before entering the temple. It is considered to be the most sacred ritual of the temple. ritual revolves around the story where Lord Venkateswara was hit on his head by a shepherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela devi,with her magic she cut a portion of her hair and implanted it on his scalp. Lord Venkateswara noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi.Information:Compulsory to take tickets before entering the temple. Two types of tickets are available.

Trip to Tirumala,"I came from chennai to tirupati at 2:00am. Ive took an auto from bustop to alipiri (steps) as I decided to go by walk, autowala charged 70(early hours) normally 50bucks and others can go by taxi/bus/own vehicles. So Ive started at 2:30 from alipiri as I was alone it didn’t took much time forme. For pilgrims by walk they will give a token and time for free darshan it was 3:00pm for me as it was sunday (heavy rush for darshan on both sat and sun). I went to the hilltop around 5:30am and I had a room booked so I went there and got fresh up. Early in the morning tirumala was simply superb with all those mantras and songs, full of peace. I took some rest in remainin time and went to some more temples there. For darshan better book early (50-normally take5-6hrs, 300-takes3-4hrs) and mine is by walk literally took 8hrs ie I came out of temple at 11:00pm and took prasad after that which was the best part. After everything done ive took a bus from tirumala busstop as there are so many buses."
One day AP Tourism organised trip to Thirumala from Chennai,On the whole worst experience. Bundled in a contract carrier. A rickety contraption.Worst of all no time management either before or after darshan .Chosen for food cheap way side eateries.Above all the eye sore the group psyche. Bad. Better to avoid. Sweetly the AP tour officials speak but less said is better.
Religious temple of India,One of the top most visited temples visited by Indians.Well maintained. Do book seegra darshan if possible for quick darshan. Helpdesk counters set up at every nearby points to help you with you query.
Went for suprabatham seva on october 15th 2019 which was a pleasant experience,"I went for suprabatham seva on october 2019 which was selected in seva DIP 3 months before. It was a very god experience at morning 2.30 or 3.00 in between this time we have to attend the temple, the queue line starts beside the temple. we have to wait in the queue until they send,for people convienience they asked us to wait in a hall where all people are waiting there we can also sit there. after this they released the lines we all ran into, after some distance running the tickets were checked multiple times by officers. after this they set the people in the halls untill the pooja starts. after all wait is over they released and we reached into aananda nilayam. the priests chanted slokas of suprabatham which was a beautiful experience, after completion of slokas we are allowed near to the god for darshan and we are not offered any teertham some are writing theertham is offered, this was the beautiful of the suprabatham seva. Thank you"
Divine temple with a never ending bliss even though u see god for 20 seconds,"we  planned a tirupathi  temple visits from Chennai. We too the Andhra pradesh Tourism Development Corporation  in Chennai ,We booked on a Tuesday darshan for 1750 Rs each. The office was at Burkit Road, T-nagar 31/14. The bus boarding time was 05:00 AM. The bus started at 05:30 AM . Decent AC volvo bus with recliner and sufficient  leg space . We reached a place for breakfast approx after 1.5 hrs. The breakfast was good in taste and quantity. we reached tirupathi at 9 Am . the bus took us up at 10 aM . The guide Ravi was very helpful and informative.We entered temple at 300Rs darshan side. It was ok inside as we Indians never will learn to behave well. we went in saw the main god Lord Venkateshwara and came out in 1.5 hrs. That was good. Each get 2 laddus for a ticket. You can buy extra for 50Rs each. The guide Ravi knew where to n get laddus faster.we went down and continued in Volvo bus for Alamemlu Mangapura. We stopped for lunch and that also was good , no complaints. We went to Alamemlu mangapura temple by 4 Pm, had a good darshan  and also this is a mandatory visit for all if they visit tiurpathi. This is off the package . U can choose tickets from 20 , 100, 200 and 500 Rs . We had head back to Chennai after that we reached at 20:30 PM . Good planning and guidance from this APTDC organisation.it is worth it for a day."
Tirupati balaji temple - tirumala,"well organised , very systematic. only one point of improvement is - increase signage, since there is language problem, and lots of devotee comes there, there should be many signage board showing counters to allocate rooms for online booking,laddu counter locationwith map.over all experience was good, very positive energy in the temple,well management for crowd.govinda... govinda.."
Balaji Darshan at Tirumala,Had a wonderful Balaji Darshan.Though entry is an ordeal but once in the view of the sanctum the feeling is very blessed.
Blissfull visit,"Visit the temple twice a year. Words cannot describe the feeling one gets when inside the sanctum, despite the pull and push and constant talking by the humans in the queue. Had taken a Rs. 300 ticket. Joined the queue at 9:15am, got the darshan by 1015am. Very fast. For sarvadarshan (with tokens), it is a 5 hour wait in the queue."
Tirupati Balaji temple,"It's around 28 kilometres from Tirupati...atop a hill, you can see the lights on the temple from the train itself... from Saptagiri check point,the climb uphill starts...they check the car, screen your baggage and you have to step out of the car and move through the screening chamber to the other side of the check point.You have to make sure that you take atleast 28 minutes to reach the top.You should wear traditional dress;saree,salwar kameez with dupatta for ladies;mundu(dhoti) for men.For special darsan which you can book online,the rate is ₹300/- per person.There are several rest areas while waiting in queue;you are served tea/ coffee/ water free of cost.Everythingbis well arranged..no crowding,no rush,even children don't have a hard time.Separate darshan's are available for couples with less than one year old children.Go ahead for a great darshan..we are just back from one such."
Mad crowd and money minded temple,"Never ever will visit again.If you have money to throw, if you are a powerful politician or vip govt official, you can stand near the balaji statue for five minutes. Or if you pay ₹10k for lord marriage ritual, you can sit near the statue for 30minutes.otherwise if you choose general dharshan, you will be caged for a day & treated like gutter worm. To hell with balaji temple."
Filled with devinity everywhere,"Tirumala hills is where Lord Venkateshwara's devinity is felt all over. Entire tirumala temple premises is maintained so well and clean, there are drinking water outlets, washrooms, anna prasadam counters, pilgrim facilitation counters and security centers to help the pilgrims to their best. Lots of free buses to climb up and down the hill. Every volenteer is dedicated to serve the needs of pilgrims which is overwhelming."
Spirituality at its Best,"Always wanted to visit but little bit scared about crowd and management But really it was a great experience for us. My suggestion is as follows for 1st time visitors. Don't book anything online other then VIP darshan if you want to quick darshan. But it was nice to normal darshan also. Directly go to tirumula from tirupati by APSRTC bus which is 1 hour journey uphills. There you can keep your baggage and family at one place and go to CRO office for room booking. Always keep Adhar, Mobile and ATM card. After getting registration you will be able to get room in 2 or 3 Hrs. Then go to allotted room and relax. In the morning at 4AM counter opens for free token. Get token for free darshan. Don't worry about free darshan long time because you enjoyed this a lot. On 2nd day book APSRTC for 4 temple visit. These buses are plying in every 10 mints."
Beautiful place,"The place is well organised.. although there is a mad rush to the temple, but very well managed, clean and you finish the entire process in a few hours. The drive to and back is also stunning."
Excellent Management,"Recently I and  my friend visited Tirupati Tirumala temple. I have been visiting the temple twice a year. It is indeed surprising how they manage so big crowd every day,specially Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate their skills of managing the rush. I will add here that if you are looking for Accommodation in Tirumala (current booking) Of ₹500. You have to wait atleast 5/6 hours. Where as ₹50 /100 easily available. So book in advance."
Tirupati balaji darshan,"The darshan was mesmerizing and worth the wait . We took about two hours to complete the darshan . Important points : 1. Keep footwear and mobile phone in the cars. 2. Take required money for donation. 3. Wear less jewellery as its very crowded. 4. Dress code Men: veshti/dhoti , kurta pyjama/churidar. No jeans allowed. Women: saree, lehenga, salwar kurta/churidar, duppatta is compulsory. 5. Strict checking for mobile phones. 6. Except money donation, no other items are accepted."
Irresponsible customer service,"Thirumala Thirupathi Balaji travels.Don't ever book in thirumala thirupathi Balaji travels. I am from Chennai and i have a toddler. We booked thirupathi dharshan for 13th of September with 20 days in advance and made payment through online for 3468rs for two persons (Vip dharshan) We called this number 9944650134 to enquire about more details. A lady picked the call and told we would get cab details on the previous day of the dharshan and disconnected the call.  She don't listen you and give full information. She always has the intention to disconnect the call whenever you call her. On the previous day of the dharshan, we called her again, she told we would get the cab details within 6 pm. But till 7 30 pm, we didn't get the details. When we called that number, that lady told she returned to home and asked us to call this number 9962809053. We called that number, a guy picked and told he will get back to me in another two minutes, but didn't call back me for 15 minutes. When we tried to call him again, he didn't pick the call, so I called from different number, he immediately picked the call and when i asked the status of the cab details, he was rudely told, he is not responsible and told me to speak to that lady and disconnected the call.Again when we called that lady, she asked us another 2000rs  for cab as the sharing cab was not available. Just think how I would felt in the last minute of the trip to Thirupathi. So I decided to go to temple on my own and asked her the refund, she told she will deduct 1068 rs  for dharshan tickets and will refund only the balance of 2400rs that too will be credited to my account after 7 working days. So I had a dharshan based on the dharshan tickets and chased them for the refund for one month. After so many calls and Chase ups, they returned the money on 16th October. It was a horrible experience with this travels."
Serene,"Tirumala is a the abode of Lord Venkateshwara. This is one of the holiest pilgrimages in South India. With several thousands of visitors daily, the Darshan time is highly monitored. Recently the TTD implemented lanes which make it easier with less pushing or prodding by other devotees. Nonetheless visiting the Lord is still one of the best experiences for anyone regardless of how little time we spend in front of him. It is never enough."
we went on a day when much crowd is not expected. But we had to experience geat crods with no crowd management in action,"Be prepared to push and shove your way through the temple. But when one finally stand in front of the deity and see the splendour of the Lord, everything is forgotten."
From Karnataka,"I visit #TTD it's really amazing place. But I saw notice boards and name boards in Telugu English Hindi and Tamil ,,, why not there in Kannada?? Karnataka people also visited more in Tirupati and they get confusions ... So please provide in Kannada language also,,,,it's my and all kannadigas request,,,plz plz it's more helpful to Karnataka people"
Awesome planning & excellent cleanliness,"With such a huge crowd visiting every day, the place was managed perfectly and great to visit. All the areas people, clean, basic needs are managed. Extremely satisfied with the management maintaining the temple. Thanks"

Lot to improve ,The temple is excellent just one thing I would suggest to authorities to please make separate ques for ladies and gents rest everything is good
Tirumala venkatesa,"Tirumala abode of lord Venkateswara, swayambhu.  Darshan even for seconds take us to immense enthusiasm.  Immediately we feel for next darshan.  Place with pushkarini, varahaswamy temple, papavinasanam, srivari padalu, akasa ganga, venugopala swamy temple, jabali theertham locating Anjaneya swamy Temple.  Ananda nilayam, the holiest place where Swamy is located, entry is everybody's wish."
Tirumala Balaji- No one review it in true sense,"Govinda Govinda... it is something which one gets to hear as soon as we enter the Tirumala massive premises. We went in 300rs darshan line. Its better to prebook your visit as the crowd is maddening there. Dont forget to carry your UID along for verification. No mobiles, camera etc are allowed. Dress code of dhoti shirt for males and salwar kurti/ saree for females are strictly followed. One can buy dhoti from ther if not carried along. Darshan lines are pretty hectic and one can get fatigued easily due to long queues. DO carry water bottles along as no means of purchase later. There is only one gate for entry and exit in the main temple. they manage the pushing crowd really well. One need to take careof kids and elderly well to avoid fall/ stampede. You get to have Balaji darshan only for max 10secs and before you bow u will be pulled out. So do keep your eyes wide open to look into the Garbha grah and take darshan for which all the efforts. Prasadam is wat you get post darshan on both the side of the lines- ladoo and curd rice. Have both they taste amazing. One can donate money in Srivari Hundi which u get while exiting. Please do have ladoos its unique to taste. Govinda Givinda"
Divinity and absolute bliss,"This place is always flooded with people still very beautifully managed . Clean and very organized. They feed to all who want to have food for free and almost most of the hrs .all are accommodated and every one gets darahan and prasad .they handle about a lakh people on an average and they keep improving the infrastructure to make it more and more people friendly.TTD which is one of the richest temple should invest in Tirupati town infra , especially closed drainage"
Visit to Agartala,This temple is one of the 51 Pethastan of Devi Uma.Small but very good atmosphere maintained. In front of temple a lake full of fish and tortoise are there.
Govinda Govinda Gooovinda,"One should must go in their life time, what a peace what a vibration, it is simply mind boggling experience"
Come and feel the difference in your life ,This is not really a tour spot or a Place where you think that you could spend your time leisurely.. This is really a place where thousands of people Come daily to have Darshan of Lord venkateswara and get their minds relieved from worries.. You could see the TTD board doing continous improvements in the Tirumala hill for the comfort of the people Coming here for Darshan..
TIRUMALA TIRUPATI DEVASTANAMS,"Amazing place and worthy,clean environment.God give to us a invisible and unmeasured poweror strength  to overcome the problems in our life by visiting only"

Jai Ho,"Idol of venkateshwara swamy is that not made by humans it is the god himself in the form of idol ,God of wealth and prosperity."
It is a must visit temple,"The temple is accessible by walk, bus and cars. Lot of facilities available at the hill shrine. Relatively well maintained for a place this busy. Almost round the clock ""anna danam"" to feed the devotees. Lord's darshan is the ultimate divine bliss. The laddu prasadam is unique and heavenly. The timings need to be increased to cater to the ever growing crowd of devotees."
Splendid architecture with great Divine Vibes,"The Tirumala Temple located in Tirupathi, Chitoor district, Andhra Pradesh is one of its kind of temple with marvelous Architecture all around. The Divine vibration will fill the body and soul making us feel the presence of divinity there. The pleasent atmosphere on the hills will attract any peace lover and make them feel delightedly happy. Apart from it's visual beauty, it give a sense of supernatural presence, making it undoubtedly the most famous and highly visited Hindu temple in the world. It's one among the 'must to visit' list of every Hindu devotee. The immense happiness on visiting the temple can never be expressed by words by any human. Only the soul can feel it. There won't be a person who would be satisfied on a single visit. Everyone who goes there will leave the place with a strong hope of visiting it atleast one again."
Booloka Vaikuntam,"One travels several miles to reach Tirupati, walk several miles and reach Tirumala, wait several hours in the queue and the moment of truth happens. 10 Seconds or 20 seconds if you are lucky. The Lord himself appears in front of you, a Gigantic murthy, pulling you like a magnet, making you shout 'Govinda Govinda' - accomplished, your pushed out, slight drops of happy tears, take a circle around the Vimana and pray to Vimana Venkateswara, get prasadam, come out of the temple and sit and start thinking, is this a dream, comes back to your home and totally forgets the face of Lord Venkateswara, wanting you to book for the next travel."
Fabulous Venkateshwara Darshan,Had nice darshan after 5 hours been in the queue and waiting hall. Had delicious sambar rice and hot milk while in the waiting hall. Overall fantastic trip
After requesting for so many times driver didn't stop the bus for urgent toilet requirement,"Today's Tirupati pilgrimage trip was good,But while coming back, after requesting for so many times alsoto stop the bus for toilet, the driver didn't stop the bus for urgent toilet requirement,this is not acceptable,Request to improve on the same.Thank You"
A suddenly planned trip turns out to be a superb success!!,"In August 2019 we suddenly decided to visit Tirumala for a Darshan. Whilst myself & my wife (both in our early 60s) are regularvisitors,  our daughter and family ( 5 year and 7 month infant, respectively) and son in law were visiting from overseas.I found that the Darshan tickets weren't available on line, the earliest being a month later. One option for my daughter & her family was to opt for the ""NRI"" ( non resident Indian) darshan, for which they ought to have arrived in India less than 30 days ago. They had decided to climb up the hill with the infant and they were therefore eligible for either ""Divya darshan"" ,which was offered for 8pm as they started the climb at 10 am and reached atop at noon. The other option was "" Darshan for parents of infants below one year"". Thty opted for the latter and finished the Darshan in less than an hour. This was free of cost.Myself,  my wife and our 5 year old grand daughter went for the senior citizen darshan where one of us had to be above 65 years of age. The counter opens at 7 am for issuing darshan tickets for the same day- either for the 10 am, the 2 pm or later slot.After standing in the queue from 7.30.am, we got our darshan tickets for the 10 am slot. That's for our grand daughter as well.Generally the temple releases 1400 tickets for senior and disabled citizen darshan daily. However twice a month they release 4000 tickets and having known this I had chosen the day accordingly.The Darshan was pleasant . We were made to wait till 10 am in a separate enclosure where we were served Upma and milk. The queue comprising all senior citizens was opened at 10 am sharp and we entered the main temple just below the overbridge. We could complete the Darshan in an hour.This was also a free darshan and we had to just pay Rs 70 for 4 laddus.The arrangements for both darshan were impeccably made by the temple authorities and for us, this short planned trip turned out to be memorable. Also a word of praise for TTDs help line- this multi lingual, 24/7 help line provided inputs that enabled us to plan well. The only discordant note was when  they said we couldn't take our 5 year old grand child in the senior darshan queue- we were allowed to do so.A marvelous visit to the holy,  ultra clean temple town cleansed our mind and refreshed our spirits!!"
Darshan,We booked our ticket online. Nri can buy their ticket on the same date. We have to line for 2 hours for darshan only. No puja system which is very good.
Tirumala Temple Review,My favorite temple in the world.Every year i am going with my wife and daughter.Temple inside lord venkateshwara is there.Its the most powerful god in the world.It is the richest god in the world turn over wise.It is located in Tirupathi state is called Andhra pradesh. once we visited in temple we will get peace..
Heavenly and Super Natural,"High spirited and amazing experience- when you reach the end of the temple for darshan. The moment of truth right in front of the Lord cannot be expressed in words. Must travel with prior bookings, packaged tour to save time. The laddoo and souvenirs are a must buy while returning."
NRI Darshan Review,"We Visited July 2019. NRI have to carry original passport with visa page. We reported at the counter around 11.00AM. People who fall under defense category, TTD volunteers, and people with infants had formed queues. NRI were made into a queue by around 11.30am. 12.00 clock the queue started to move. The passport was checked and we were allowed to enter ticket issue building. Below 12 years of age the darshan cost is free. Else it is INR 300 per person. We paid money in this building our passport was again verified and we proceeded further to join the darshan queu.  When our passport was verified it was around 1.00pm. At each point we saw people joining into our queue from various points. Like people who did some special Pooja can also join, sheegra darshan people join .  Our darshan got over around 2.45pm. However to come out of the temple was the greatest rush . We get free ladoo token after darshan. And this ladoo has to be collected from another complex. Please carry your own covers. Covers can be also purchased from the ladoo complex. However there is time to be spend only to purchase covers and then separate queu to collect the ladoos. Altogether our darshan process that day took 3.5 hours  to 4 hours. Please wear Dhotis  or saree or  Churidar with duppata as per the TTD guidelines."
Its wonderful religious place,Very nice place on the top of the Saptagiri Mountains. With people having lot of faith in the Lord Balaji
"Rich and Powerful Lord. Beware of the People (Taxi, Rickshaw, Hotel, Restaurants, etc.)","Always beware while travelling to the temple. Taxi, as well as auto-rickshaw Drivers, are very crooked and their only aim is to ‘loot’ you. Always bargain and fix the taxi fare prior to your travel. The temple is located on a mountain away from the Tirupati town. Taxi Drivers bargain fare from Airport to Town and to Temple differently. I recommend to take a Toyota Innova car if you have a family members of 5 or more for comfortable travel to the top of the temple. Keep the sane taxi and Driver for your come back as well. Or else you may need to bargain with another Looting Taxi or Jeep Driver after you offer prayers. Airport Taxi offers one day Taxi about 5000/-₹ per day rate. A strong suggestion for the temple visitors is always book a ‘special Darshan’ by paying 300/- ₹ per head to avoid the long hours (7 to 8 hours) queue to shorter 2 hours queue. Be fresh to stay in queue, carry enough 2 bottles of water with you to avoid dehydration. Book a taxi from your place of stay to visit the temple. Leave your foot wears, digital watches, cameras, mobile phones, etc at your hotel. These are not permitted inside the temple. Alcohol bottles, beers, cigarettes, etc are also not permitted. If anyone wish to drive your own car, please be aware of the Security check of yourselves, vehicles and baggage. If you get caught, they will ban your vehicles’ entry and ask you to take taxi or Bus to go to the Temple. Dress code for ladies is saree or decent Churidar. Men shall wear white dothi and decent shirt.May lord Balaji bless you..."
Pure Bliss,Have been going on this pilgrimage since the last 45 years. The place has changed over the years but for the better. The facilities for pilgrims have increased manifold. The queue management has been streamlined by online booking & could finish my Darshan in 90 minutes end to end.The only regret is that the glimpse of the deity is from afar. Understandably due to the heavy rush..
Divine,"Tirumala is a divine place where Lord Balaji gives blessings to all the pilgrims who come to worship him. Its worth a visit and excellently managed place with proper Bus facilities, numerous different room types facilities, a lot of free food options within the temple premises and paid restaurants in the nearby vicinity. The main Gabhara (area or place where Lord Balaji resides) of the temple doesn't have any electric light & it's beautifully lighted with Diyas. Its has a large open space where over 1 lack pilgrims seek the blessings of Lord Balaji per day & during festivals, the count increases more than 3 times. There are 2 types of darshan options, one is getting Rs. 300 special entry Darshan where the darshan gets in around 2-3 hours waiting in the line. Another line is free darshan line which ranges between 6-24 hours of waiting. As it is said to be one of the 'Jagrut Devasthan', there are lot of people who believe in Lord Balaji and it is said that if you go to Lord Balaji with a clean heart and true intentions, he listens to your prayer. To conclude with, I had probably one of the best time spending hours in Tirumala and seek his blessings & its worth the wait.Om Namo Venkateshay Namah"
Very crowded but worth visiting,"Even on a special entry- it took good 4 hours to get two moments (literally) in front of Govinda. The light inside sanctum sanctorum is so little that by the time your eyes adjust to see anything, you are pushed out. Amazing to see and experience the faith of the masses. We were able to come out in 4-5 hours and people said you are very lucky. We met people from all over India in one place. A great melting pot. Overall once of a lifetime experience. Worth visiting."
Lord Venkateswara Swamy Temple ,"Excellent Pilgrimage place, Very Sacred and Powerful Place on the earth. Accommodation, Food facilities arranged by Temple authorities are Extrodinarily good and cannot be compared with any other systems. Hygiene maintained is beyond imagination."
Tirumala tirupati devasthanams,"At a distance of 22 km from Tirupati, 87 km from Chittoor, 435 km from Vijayawada, 574 km from Hyderabad, 785 km from Vizag, 155 km from Chennai and 271 km from Bangalore, Tirumala, located in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, is one of the most famous pilgrimage centers in India and also one of the top places to experince Andhra Pradesh tourism. Tirumala is commonly referred as Tirupati by devotees, but they are 22 km apart and the sacred Balaji Temple is situated in Tirumala.Tirumala, adobe of Sri Venkateswara (also known as Balaji - an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) is one of the most celebrated pilgrimage centers in India and it attracts millions of devotees every year.

"SREENIVASA GOVINDA......
SREEVENKATESWARA GOVINDA.......","Real holi place In India,provide Huygenian food preparation and always treat as guest.keep distance from unauthorized priests or agents. Pedestrians keep in mint 3550/steps use free leguage service(its very safety and comfortable).I am not suggested jeep sightseeing trip in thirumala(they will make urgency) r.s. 55/ charging bus service much more better.in thirupathy city I got best food from sri lakshmi narayana bhavan.definitely everyone like here food."
The most reverred temple,"Despite million visits every month, temple maintains good hygiene standards. There is scope for enhancing devotees experience by providing extra seconds to pray before the great deity."
Worst crowd management,"Please dont go there without special entrance ticket. On 28th July 2019, we reached Tirumala at around 4pm. I planned this trip 3 weeks before and I arranged everything except special entrance ticket (which was not available at that time). Since we havent got any special entrance ticket, we went through free dharshan entrance. Queue started at around 8.30pm and I thought that they might put us in compartment for few hours and I was like okay since I had no choice. But the problem started at the entrance of the queue itself. We were standing in that line for more than 4 hours (before reaching the compartments), around few hundreds returned back since they were unable to stand for a long time. Its completely fine if they put us in compartments, but standing in a queue for 4 hours is not at all acceptable. Total time took around 10 hrs. What kind of management is this? Even they have millions and billions of money, why they were unable to manage properly? We are all humans here and you (ttd) should not do like this. And I noticed one thing when I was coming out after darshan, which is VIP entrance. They stopped the normal queue for more than an hour because of some VIPs. It looks like they are stopping queues in between at some interval for VIP to have quick darshan and thats the whole reason behind this waiting time everyday.So please dont go there without a special entry ticket (Rs.300) and if the tickets are not available at the time of booking, better go with apsrtc or irctc or any other package. If you still dont find any tickets, try to reach early (around 6am or 7am) in the morning and get time slot sarva darshan ticket which is a free ticket but time based. You can avoid standing in queue before compartments.Thanks!"
Important to know before visiting Tirupati,"I would like to share my Tirupati experience so that others visiting in near future gets a benefit. This can answer many questions which one can have in mind before planning their visit. 1.	We had booked Special Entry Darshan tickets online at TTD website 2 months prior to our visit. Ours was 11 AM slot on Saturday.  People suggest avoiding weekends and public holidays to avoid major rush2.	We stayed in Tirupati where we got a good hotel with comfortable stay and good restaurant 3.	On the day of arrival we visited Govindrajswami temple in the heart of Tirupati. We had to go through a quite a long queue here also.4.	Next morning we started for Tirumala by cab in the morning at 8:20 AM. We reached at the top at 9:20 AM. We were following the traditional dress code. Kurta pajama and Salvar kurta with Dupatta.5.	The driver dropped us at the parking near Varaha Swami temple6.	We then visited Pushkarini Tirtham and Varaha Swami temple and returned back to the car7.	The driver then dropped us near Special Darshan Entry gates. We left our footwear and mobile phones in the car, to avoid the queues at the locker and save time. I just had a small sling bag to keep money and some biscuits. We also had a water bottle. You can carry a purse but it is difficult the manage in queue.8.	We had to walk for 5 mins to the entry point where our tickets were checked and we were allowed to enter. It was 9:45 AM. The people from time slots later than 11 AM had to wait outside9.	We then passed through a security check. Our tickets and ID proofs were checked here. Then we were asked to get lined up in a small queue. I guess only few of us were allowed to join the queue. People coming later were asked to wait in the waiting halls where there were chairs to seat.10.	Our queue was quickly got merged with the Sarvadarshan queue. And then started a big rush. People do not believe in queue discipline there. Everyone tries to push and go ahead of you and there is no one to control this queue. This is a wide queue so queue discipline is not maintained by default.  There is no place to seat in this queue.11.	Initially the queue was slowly moving but then it stopped completely for some time. Then again it started moving slowly. After passing through several halls and a staircase, we entered the main temple complex.12.	And finally we reached the temple entrance. Where the large golden pillar is there. Once you reach there, means you are very near to the actual deity. 13.	Then the queue was broken into multiple parallel queues. And now finally you can see the deity. It is dark inside so you really need to focus to get the darshan. You get a chance for darshan only for 4-5 seconds so do not waste the opportunity in looking somewhere else otherwise in no time you will be out and miss the opportunity. We were outside the temple at 11:05 AM14.	Once you come outside you will find directions to go to the laddu counter where you can get your laddus. You have to walk a few meters bare footed to go till the laddu counter. So if you are in a group, few people can choose to wait instead of everyone going to the laddu counter.15.	300/- ticket includes 2 laddus for each person. You can also buy extra laddus online at the time of ticket booking or you have to buy a laddu coupon again standing in the queue. You need a bag or container to keep the laddus, so better to keep one clean bag with you to avoid the second queue for buying laddu covers. And then you have to stand in a third queue to get the laddus, after showing your ticket or a coupon 16.	Getting into the queue or waiting inside the waiting hall and the waiting time required is all depend upon various factors, like number of pilgrims visiting that particular day, your darshan slot, etc. Also, the darshan schedules vary depending upon the day of the week you are visiting, so I cannot comment on how much time it will take for you but we were lucky to get the darshan in 1.5 hrs. People say that it takes at least 3 hours for special entry darshan.  We required total 3 hours at Tirumala.17.	We returned back the Tirupati and then visited the Padmavati temple and our Tirupati yatra was complete."
Tirupati Kalahasthi,We arrived at Renigunta station on 13 th July 2019 12.30 pm took an auto to Tirupati 250 rupeesStayed at Adhithi Residency hotel.its nearby the bus stand.very neat and clean.Good hotels to eat nearbySame day we hired a auto had darshan of Padmavati at 4 pm and went to kapila theertham.Next day 14th morning 7am started to walk towards Tirumala.  It took 5 hours for us to finish.  First 1.5 hours are difficult as there are only steps.  Afterwards it becomes little easier. Had lunch at Hotel Sarangi.  We had booked online for 4 pm darshan.  Started by 2.45 pm in the line.  Finished darshan and came out by 4.30 pmIt took one more hour to collect the laddus and our baggage.  Took a shared jeep for down.Next day visited Kalahasthi by bus.Left for Renigunta It was a nice trip.But nowadays they don't have enough lights or for some reason they are not switching on the electric lights inside the Sanctum sanctorum.garbagruham
Tirumala ,Peaceful place & Line to darshan even the special darshan take 3hrs was too hard and the root to darshan was very conjusted & Que management was not proper in some area it was too hard to move & there was no sitting space between the line to darshan in this 3 hrs.
Divine,Had a nice time. Most of the things are organised. Do eat prasadam. Had a wonderful time with family.
Suprabhata seva,"I was blessed to witness the supreme from a very close distance. We reached suprabhata seva Q line by 12am itself but we were late by some 60 people. At 2 am we are allowed inside,  you have to wait now and then in the Q,  but you will be allowed in the temple at the right time. There are about 200 people get to attend the seva, along with some VIPs if present. We all have to stand in the Jaya Vijaya hall,  that means first Hall itself. The seva start with gopalak lighting the panju(path light)  the priesthood open the door and enters with panju along with the water in pots for his bath. Along with us,  the shaivars starts suprabhatam.  This continues in the Hall.  Inside the rituals of srivaari will be going on. Once suprabhatam is over,  one by one we all are allowed till the sanctum to witness the supreme in very near. After darshan you will 2 srivaari laddu prasaadam at the outside laddu prasaadam counter."
Divine,For the believers the place is divine.. the long wait in the ques for a few seconds of  darshan is well worth it.. the arrangements are very good with facilities provided at every crucial place.. try and take a Rs 300 darshan ticket for a faster experience..
Bangalore to Tirumala in one day,"On one of the Tuesdays in February, decided to go to Tirumala. I took the bus from Majestic at 5 pm and reached Tirupathi by 10.30 pm. Stayed in a nice lodge close to the bus stand for 1.1k, an ac room with tv, wifi. Woke up on the next day at around 4.30am and took an autorickshaw to Srivari Metlu(Lord's stairs). This place is around 20kms from Tirupathi. Reached the start point of the ghat road to Tirumala by 5.45 am. They open the ghat road only at 5.45-6 am as leopards may attack devotees in dark. The trek has nearly 2400 steps. At 1100 steps, there'll be a biometric pass issued for darshan. There will be one more check after 2000 steps. Once you reach Tirumala, volunteers serve hot milk and prasadams. I reached by 8 am but many take only 1.30 hours. Had darshan at 11 am and came down to Tirupathi by 12.30pm. Went to Padmavathi temple and took the bus to Bangalore at 3pm. The trick is to go before the exam time starts on a weekday to beat the rush and have a peaceful darshan."
It is easy to plan and execute a visit to TiruPathi and have darshan of Lord Venkateshwara,Excellent management of the shrine board or whosoever is managing it. If in case a family is not getting an entry ticket in advance so please choose a walking route from another side of the mountain. This way tickets can be arranged on the spot. Be cautious around in case of a heart patient or elderly person.
Quite Spiritual place but too much of crowd is a serious pain,"I was here after 1 hour flight from Bangalore and also had VIP pass, still it took more than 3+ hours to enter temple where idol resides inside shrine in temple sanctum. You only get glimpse of lord just for few seconds and that's it all pain and hustle went off after darshan of lord, and no doubt the place is highly spiritual and full of energy which you can feel it and makes it special."
World famous temple,"Tirumala temple is one of the most famous temples in all over world, which draws large crowd through out the year. Pilgrim must book online pass to visit this temple."
Tirumala Balaji Temple,"Lord Balaji famous and well known temple is located at Tirumala near Tirupati. One of the famous worship temple in South for Hindus is Tirumala Balaji Temple. It is really wonderful experience worth visit in any season. South people regularly visiting this template. Because they believe that, their prayers are successful in their lives."
what a temple . lot of piligrims.,one  must visit this temple without fail. the kind of arrangements done by management is really superb. there is no single mosquito on the hills.really great
Our family visited the thirumala that december time .I think december time is visiting is very good.,The december time not a big cloud .I HINK DECEMBER1-20 no big rush.No GOVT. holidys that time sinior citizen visit the temple.
A TEMPLE WORTH THE HARDSHIP,When you are going up to the temple by ghat road you cannot help thinking who has built this temple - god or man? Because in those days how did anybody carry all the tools and material up the hill. The statue itself inspires godliness and wakes up the goodness in you. Really worth seeing once in a lifetime. If you have strength and energy see it quite often.
Visit to tirumala,The place is awesome and has a great religious value. The darshan at the temple were very special and auspicious.
rowdy crowd,I dont think TTD can do anything more about crowd control...devotees should respect the Q and not try to take short cuts...especially telugu ppl..I got a feeling they felt they deserve to go past the crowd coz its in their state ...i saw so many of them fighting with each other and also others..I may be wrong coz I have had a long association with telugu ppl and they are generally soft spoken and very sweet but not the crowd i met there in express darshan....
"No God, just business",Most efficiently run and profitable business. Idol worshipping of Hindus has been converted to an unmatchable business where the advertisers are the customers themselves. So with minimal expense you have maximum sales. Wow. 👌
Tirupati doubt,If i reach tirupati on 23/06/2019 sunday ;7 am. Can i get darshan before 10 pm on the same day??plz help
Darshan Pilgrim Management Not Sufficient – Overcrowded place Worsen Situation in the Queues,"Me alongwith my mother, wife and two daughters are visited Shree Balaji Temple in first week of June’19. Language is a barrier in counters and this place. After that the first gate comes when devotees need to go down through few staircases & after lots of up & downs disciples reached just behind the main temple where one more security check they need to pass. Just crossing these security windows devotees will reach just beside main temple. People will entire inside an unbelievable over congested queues segregated by steel pipes (3 / 4 numbers of queues) where devotees are pushing, pulling each other’s unnecessary and no one (means no security / volunteer) managing properly. Starting from this place to darshan is overcrowded, over congested and very badly managed by temple volunteers. Presence of police personnel is very few in numbers. I haven’t seen them to manage the queues inside or outside the temple.The entrance of main temple starts & the main pandemonium starts. Half of the darshan entrance queues are not having barricades or fencing for control the darshan crowd, chaotic situation for the old aged devotees, child’s. My mother & my younger daughter stopped this place by their own due to messy situation. However, me, my wife and my elder daughter continued with the crowed and reached in the main temple after a long struggle in this unmanaged situation. We succeeded a darshan of Shree Balaji for around 4 to 5 seconds only but the darshan was good and peaceful."
Tirupati trip - from Chennai,"Our journey started in chennai. We were told that the total trip cost would be 12000. The duration of darshan was told that it will take 45 minutes - VIP darshan. We specifically confirmed whether is it a normal 300 rupees darshan or a VIP darshan. But they said it is a VIP darshan only and it will surely take 45 minutes of only and a guide will be there for you throughout. But they cheated us, the guide came till the entry of Rs.300 darshan and said he will meet after darshan. The darshan almost took 4 hours and 15 minutes. If they would have said it would take this much time we would have prepared atleast. We were carrying a child and it was crying for food. Adults somehow could adjust but how could a child adjust. Since they said it is a fast darshan, we took elders, who felt really stressed out because of the darshan. And after coming out we were made to wait for the vehicle because of the miscommunication between the guide and driver. Then we thought we can have lunch somewhere nearby but they said for lunch we have to go to downhill(keezh) tirupati. We said we are gonna have lunch up only and finished and came. But the driver where forcing us to come fast. Then we came to downhill and continued our journey back. While going the driver told us that if the trip lasted more than 10pm to reach home, we have to pay extra money. It is never about the money, so we paid but it is the stress they made us to suffer. So please while choosing this trip via the AP tourism, Plan accordingly even if they tell all sort of lies."
Good,"Tirumala temple, beautiful temple in a beautiful location, crowded with people's, overall good atmosphere for pray"

Overcrowded in peak,We visited the temple in peak season in a weekend. Suggest one to plan well in advance if travelling with family.
"Sr Citizen Darshan at Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, India","There is a special counter near VQC-2(Vaikunda Que Complex_2), opposite to S.V.Museum for getting Sr Citizen Darshan Token at Tirumala. The counter is named as Specially disabled/Sr.Citizen Darshan Token issuing counter.  I (am more than 65 years old)had the Sr citizen darshan on 6th June 2019. Spouse (even if below 60) are allowed to accompany Sr. Citizen above 65 . For getting the Sr Citizens token, i joined the que along with my wife(both were carrying Aadhavan cards) at 6 am. By that time already about 150 persons were in the que. The counter opened at 7.10am. The que started moving. Myself and my wife got the token (after verifying mine and my wife's Aadhaar card and after taking photos of both of us) at about 7.45 am. In the token (each of us were allowed 2 laddus on payment of Rs.20 for 2 laddus) our darshan timing was mentioned as 10am. In the token que we were served milk/tea. First 150 persons were asked to stand in que. Remaining who came behind were provided seats in token que. Then we went to our accommodation(which was nearby), freshened and came back to the same place at 8.35am(by that time first 700 tokens had already been distributed; they started distributing from 8.35am, 2nd lot of 700 tokens for darshan meant for 3.00pm). From this token counter, we were taken by van(free) to Supadham(waiting complex with seating arrangement for 700 persons in North Mada Street which had toilet facilities) . We were provided free tiffin and milk. We waited there up to 10.45 am. Specially disabled persons were allowed 1 escort from the disabled person's family. Disabled persons were provided wheel chair facility. Our que of 700 persons were taken through North Mutt Street(this is 100 feet from main entrance) at 10.45 am. We finished darshan at 11.10am. While our que(Sr citizen que) was inside the temple, all other ques were blocked for about half an hour. There were no pushing in the que. We had darshan of Lord for about 5 to 6 seconds. Thanks for nice arrangements, though it took 5 hours and 15 minutes right from the time of standing in the que for token at 6.00 am."
WORST Tour operator,This is for a day trip pkg (booked a minivan). Rude driver and zero professionalism. Will avoid this operator like the plague.
Comfortable darshan with an infant,"We visited the temple around our baby's first birthday. They had a separate line for infants and their immediate family (parents & siblings). From the time we entered the line until the temple's main entrance there was almost no jostling and the line moved extremely fast. At the temple entrance all the lines merge, but since the infant darshan is primarily in the morning, the crowd was manageable. From the time we entered the line until darshan, it took us just 45 minutes - which is extremely impressive considering it's Tirumala temple. Full credits to the TTD team on making the darshan safe and convenient for infants. The way out of the temple after seeing the Lord is complete chaos. I wish there was a way to bypass the prasadham offered inside the temple. Dear TTD, if you are reading this, please consider moving this outside the main temple. It will ease up the crowd outflow significantly. Or provide a separate exit route for parents with infants."
Lord Venkateshwara Darshan,"Went for Darshan of Lord Venkateshwara with my wife and 5-year old daughter. Chose the 300 Rupees special darhsan ticket. Booked tickets online and choose number of ladies as well. You are allowed to enter about an hour before your slot. Initial half distance takes few minutes after your ticket is checked. Midway, you join others in 300 Darshan queue in cell type rooms. While there are fans and air blowers they don’t really cool you down. It takes about 1.5 hours from this point on to complete Darshan. The queue hooks sarva (free) Darshan queue near the entrance and post that it is quite an organised chaos. Get ready to push and be pushed. Near the sanctom santorum there are 3 lines. Take the middle or right most lane for a good view of the lord. While it is only 2-3 seconds of the lord that you can view, these 2 lanes give a good view for these few moments. Ladoo counters are behind the temple mains and after the exit. Take a bag or be ready to stand in 2 queues. One for the bag to be bought and one for laddoos."
"A great location, pity about the organised chaos on visiting the Temple","We really were looking forward to visiting the Tirumala Temple, which we were sure would be the highlight of our South Indi trip.Though the drive up through the hills was amazing, reaching the actual Temple in good time, our visit to the Temple was a nightmare as there was considerable amount of jostling in the queues and irrespective of your age/ gender one was pushed and shoved around, also there simply were not enough guards around to control this element. Pathetic behaviour and a disaster awaiting to happen. Sad to say that this is so in the supposedly most exotic of Hindu Temples in India.On actually getting to the shrine, we were disappointed that the 'Darshan' of the dieties was from so far away.Would not recommend a visit to this Temple unless it is carried out very early."
darshana of LORD VENKATESHWARA,nicely done & well kept roads bothways Q complex  and temple complex well kept clean and inside when we stand in front of lord we were in a different world
Divine experience amidst ocean of devotees,"This is a must visit place but best to visit during off seasons (though it is very few). The facilities are fantastic considering more than lac people visit here daily. The place is kept clean with regular sweeping all over. There are multiple ways to seek god blessing -- free darshan, paid tickets of different denominations or by way of doing special poojas and kalyana Utsavam. God forbid on your day, if there is a VIP visit (which is very regular) and the entire queue is stopped or slowed and this could stretch your darshan time to hours!! Facilities inside the waiting area is too is very good with free food /drinks etc. Last stretch of about 500 - 800mts is where all types of queues merge and is literally free of all and this could be managed better especially it could be challenging for women and kids. You get two laddus if you are going via package tourism or higher denomination tickets. There are also bigger laddus for special pooja. If you need more, stand in the queue just outside the main entrance..and purchase as many you want. There are frequent buses from Tirupathi to Tirumala..One can also climb the hill (two paths are there--one shorter and steep and one longer). You could tonsure your head at different places at tirumala. Free food is offered to all devotees. Free guest houses are also available but needs very advance booking. There are also other paid accommodation that one can book in advance."
Beautiful Place,Beautiful place. This time while visiting the temple the darshan happened very quickly. Nice place on the hills.
Best Time to Visit Tirupati,"Hello Friends, Best time to visit tirupathi is from October to december, you can see the water falls on tirumala hills and due to post spring season whole tirupathi will be cool with 0% humidity, If you are planning to visit tirupati please do visit in the month of October."
One of the best piligrimage places to visit,"We love this place. Your heart and mind will be with God worshipping his name all the time. Very lively and crowded place round the clock. Standing queue to darshan is around 3 kms long and takes about 4-5 hrs. People with small kids, be prepared with some food. No phones allowed in queue. But the darshan of Lord Balaji will make you forget all the tiredness. Though they allow only less than minute to have full proper darshan, it is worth all the effort. We were in a separate queue because of the small kid and UK passport holders. so time to darshan took around an hour. Plan to stay at Tirupathi and visit Tirumala as finding accommodation at Tirumala is very difficult. I generally walk from Tirupati to Tirumala from Alipiri metlu which is around 2500 steps and takes 2 hours - nice, neat and safe. You will get some eatables during the way if your are tired. You will be entitled for free darshan if you walk up the hill. No scarcity for food anywhere. People are very honest and polite. You will get good support and help where required."
pilgrimagetour,"it is onhe hille ofholiest place in India the templeis located on the hill, here all the 12 months people will visit the templeanwe can get accomdation freemeals .but ifwant t0 visityou shouldprogrammewell in adva ncethe get reservation for acccomadtion darshan."
"Govinda, Govinda!","The Balaji Temple located at Tirumala Hills is one of the most famous Hindu pilgrimage centres in the world. It is the abode of Lord Venkateshwara, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and is visited by millions of devotees every year.  It is managed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Board who provide numerous facilities to the devotees for the darshan. Tickets for the Darshan and accommodation at the abode can be booked well in advance by visitors online at nominal cost. Two Ladoos (sweet) are provided with each ticket free and more can be ordered online too.  The temple is connected by road, rail and air from most cities of the country. Numerous restaurants provide tasty vegetarian meals at reasonable rates at the Hills.  Free meals are also offered at the Temple.  Darshan of the Lord Venkateshwara at the Sanctum makes a devotee spellbound.  A memorable visit every time."
"Best place ever visited, full of serenity.","I have visited Tirumala temple on 24th April 2019.From Tirupati railway station you can either go directly to the Tirumala temple by bus which costs rupees 55 or you can choose another part where you need to work for ten kilometres including 3700 steps approx, covering Seven Hills. There is one advantage of choosing the walking path is that you will get a Divya darshanam pass for visiting the temple andh is entitled for one free laddu made from Desi Ghee. Along the walking path you will find cold drink shops and other shop serving buttermilk and other regional shakes.After reaching Tirumala, you need not to worry about anything as you will get everything free of cost from food, accommodation and your hair cutting free of cost.They also have free luggage facility and also computerized. Hadn't seen this type of Management anywhere else in India.After visiting Lord Venkateswara temple you will feel really Majestic. Regional people often called lord as Govinda. There is a building having 8 to 10 halls, where in every hall having capacity of thousand people. These halls they provide you Anna prasadam, delicious food.Everyone should visit this place once in a lifetime, it is the richest temple of India."
Very good ,"It’s the grandest temple . All facilities are there for darshan, though the queues are long and the time given on the ticket is not adhered to. Thus causing long wait periods"
marvelous temple,"tirumala temple is very famous in entire world, must visit once in a life time. very power full swamy"
holistic place,"how we explain our feel when vists the swamy temple, after swamy darshan, it is no words to explain just feel the power of swamy."
Lord Venkateswara Temple visit,Best darshan available and best possible adobe of God. Best to see before 1200 noon and between 1500 hrs to 1700 hrs to avoid rush
Tirumala pilgrim centre,Place was very good to visit and your mind will be peaceful whenever you visited to this place. Everytime will get mango pieces here which I like very much and devasthana food yummy and tasty . Worship God here to get good days in your life.
Tirupati,It's the second richest temple in india and accessibility like we may visit this temple by steps or by road in road no accessibilities available till we reach near to the temple and we can have all accessibility available in temple place where's in steps many small stores are available there and it was very helpful and more usefull small hotels are also available there.Local seeing like first we visit lord perumal and then we came out after visiting lord perumal they arrange a bus facility to see all places overall surrounding and the temple is placed in high of the mountain and by bus we may see some more temples with free of cost.
DIVINE EXPERIENCE,Sheer divine joy . This is the place to forget about earthly things and just merge with divine powers . Not to be missed whenever one gets the oppertunity .
Very clean and place with positive vibes,"A very famous place in India where the temple of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy is situated. Lord in the king of the place and rest all are sevaks. Very cool and clean place with lot of amenities related to transport, food & shelter. Accommodation is provided by TTD (Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanams) only. Its an trust which takes care of all requirements  of the main temple and nearby temples in and around Tirupati."
A wonderful Temple on the Hills,"Situated in a beautiful mountainous surrounding, the Venkateshwara Temple in Tirumala is the most popular and the richest (in terms of donation) on Earth. The number of visitors per day is about 100,000, which makes an enormous crowd to manage. In spite of their best efforts, the crowd of pilgrims in the passages was formidable. In addition to that, think of the security gates where you must be checked for your identity. At times, I felt that I made the wrong decision to come. With a VIP ticket, it took me more than three hours to reach the Sanctum where I was allowed a maximum of five seconds for darshan. Anyway, after the darshan, however short, I felt spiritually uplifted."
Incredible place and majestic beauty,Take a bus or train from Bangalore or Chennai. You have walk for 8 km from bus stand or you can travel by bus . You have stand for at least 4-6 hrs in line.lodoos are amazing.
Govinda Govinda!,You will feel blissful if you see the deity for even 1 second.. soulful experience. Must visit this temple but ready to stand in a queue for long. It took us 5 hours in a special ticket line of 100/- each.
Devotional place to visit,"It's been great time and enjoyed the stay in tirumala which is the cleanest and peaceful place. Visited places like Papavinasanam, Aakasha Ganga also. It's very good."
Tirumala darshan,"Visited on 6th april 2019. The access roads to and from the temple are excellent. Collected free sarvadarshanam tickets at tirupati rail station which is a nice idea for the available 3 pm slot. Reached the temple at 2.30pm. Completed darshan at 7.30pm. 5 hrs for darshan was very tiring especially as the rows were very crowded. Had to wait 45 minutes at the prasad coupon buying counter prior darshan as there was complete chaos. No rows,people jostling and fighting. After that we reached a large hall. There were several other halls like that. All packed to capacity with us having no knowledge what lay ahead. Somebody informed that from this hall onwards it will take another two hrs for darshan. After one hr of waiting the hall gate was opened and people rushed madly until we reached another narrow waiting area fully packed and people still jostling to move as forward a position as possible. After half an hour again we started moving and reached barricaded rows and moved thru them for another half an hr. Then we had beautiful darshan of the lord. The temple was beautifully decorated and there was divine aura around the place. After darshan till exit again there was pushing and jostling.There is lots and lots of scope for improvement if it indeed is the richest Hindu temple. There is no crowd management or neither any safety measures around. It is a disaster waiting to happen due to any inadvertent mishap as the areas r very crowded and management is not visible.Some people were saying that Rs 300 VIP darshan is easier but we could not book them as it gets booking starts 3 months in advance."
A Sacred and greatly satisfying visit to one of the Holiest places on the planet,"A wonderful visit to Lord Balaji Temle at Tirumala - am full of gratitude and feel a sense of calm and satisfaction.I thought I should pen a few details so my fellow travellers and devotees know what to expect and what to do if they will be going to Tirumala.  So do bear with the long(ish) review!We had booked the Special Entry Darshan tickets online on the official website and so readers may note that my comments will relate only to my own experiences with this mode of access to the Temple. I'd recommend this mode in case you have no access to the VIP route that ensures an even faster darshan (but requires intervention of persons belonging to the so-called ‘higher or influential echelons’ of society!).The SED ticket costs Rs 300 per person and includes two laddus (prasadam). You could buy more while booking your SED ticket. You are allowed to enter the queue at the first entry point 30 to 60 minutes before the appointed time. That way one can get into the queue earlier than the appointed time and hopefully save some time.Before that, here’s something I’ve not come across from the not so many reviews I’ve read up. The drive up the Tirumala hills from Tirupati is about 16 km from the vehicle check point at the base of the hill. The entire route is one-way and you can actually make it to Tirumala in less than 15 mins, but you are not permitted to! In fact, the timings are recorded on the vehicle pass and you are not to arrive at Tirumala in less than 30 minutes from the entry time recorded. Similarly, you are not permitted to arrive back atTirupati on your way down (also a one-way road) the hill less than 40 mins from the time you started from Tirumala. I thought this was a great measure to limit speed and rash driving. Passengers have to alight from their vehicles and walk through the frisking checkpoints and scanners, while the vehicles, its contents/luggage and chaffeurs are checked separately. You may expect to spend about 10 to 20 mins at this checkpoint depending on vehicular/visitor traffic on any given day. I understand weekends and festival/public holidays see much greater vehicles/crowds.For the record, both roads are exceptionally clean with great surface quality – a pleasant surprise. I’d go a step further to praise Tirumala for its well-landscaped terrain, the ample directional signages as well as the maintenance and cleanliness. Tirupati, too, despite being a bustling town is fairly clean with the public transport looking more immaculate compared with those in many small towns I’ve visited around the country.As for the dress code, as mentioned in the official website of TTD, men are expected to wear a dhoti-shirt or a dhoti-upper cloth or churidar-kurta/pyjama combination. Women are permitted to wear sarees or a simple churidar-kurta or a salwar-kameez. Jeans, shorts, T-shirts, skirts that reveal the body are considered inappropriate and one may not be permitted to enter the darshan queue. The queue passes through two or more security check-points where one is liable to be frisked. The queue lanes are narrow and usually finds two persons alongside each other (as over enthusiastic devotees, we tend to form two lines in each lane!). And beware, if you find the occasional turn in a lane that allows for a little more room, your fellow devotees will surely break out to get ahead of you – as if it’s a race that’s to be won at the cost of ‘one-up’ping your fellow devotees. I’ve never understood this shameful behavior that is typical of our society. On the brighter side, the various enclosures (rooms or cells if you want to call them) that you pass through while in the queue are well ventilated and airy and equipped with several fans. So although it’s a little warm inside, you’re not going to feel the scorching heat even in the summer. You can expect to have the Lord’s Darshan for not more than 15 to 30 seconds while you are ‘herded’ along the queue by the temple ushers. Mind you, the ushers are ladies who are carefully trained to grab you by your hand, virtually drag you through the queue and ungracefully show you the way out lest you are tempted to stop in front of the Lord to take a few more breaths and bow down and pray some more. The way you are herded is definitely not a pleasant experience, especially for those who do respect the need to keep moving along the queue to allow for felloe devotees to get their share of the Darshan. Despite this, the Darshan of the Lord is very calming and sacred, and it’s worth your faith, devotion, patience and composure. Post the darshan, the prasadam counter complex is where you need to queue up again to collect your Laddus. The Laddus are not pre-packed and so you will need to buy bag/s (Rs 3 per bag) from a separate counter alongside the prasadam counters.      Mind you, the SED ticket is first scanned at the check-point after you enter the queue and this is where your IDs are matched with the ID numbers you provided while booking the SED ticket. You must retain the SED ticket because it is scanned once again at the laddu counter to determine the number of laddus that you are entitled to collect. If you hadn’t booked enough laddus earlier, you could, after your Darshan, purchase additional tokens at the separate laddu token counters inside the laddu counter complex)I’d also like you to remember that if you have a vehicle waiting for you at the exit of the temple, you should prefer to leave behind your footwear and other belongings in your vehicle at the time you got off at the entry point of the temple. Your vehicle can be ready and waiting for you at the exit point. Otherwise, you will have to make your way all the way to the footwear/belongings counter at the head of the queue.  And be prepared to march away or scamper quickly across the temple grounds as the surface heats up rapidly at noon especially during the summers.Mobile phones and any other electronics items are strictly not permitted to be carried inside. You may however carry along your wallets/cards/currency notes, wear belts if you do. I’d recommend you do not carry large bags and water bottles. There is drinking water provision at every short distance. Wash rooms have been well-placed at regular intervals, but be sure you will have to negotiate the densely packed queue lanes to get to one in a hurry.Finally, if you hope to quietly chant or meditate while in the queue, be ready to do so alongside the occasional group singing bhajans or chanting out loud. Stay calm and composed !For the record - we had opted for the 11 am slot on the first Monday of April. We started from our hotel at Tirupati at 9.30 am, crossed the vehice checkpoint by 9.45 am, reached Tirumala at 10.25 am. We entered the first entry point at 10.35 am, lined up at the queue at 10.45 am after the first checkpoint/ticket scan, experienced the Darshan at 12.40 pm, collected the laddu prasadam at 1.00 pm and finally exited the Temple complex at 1.10 pm. We started back from Tirumala at 1.20 pm and reached Tirupati at about 2.10 pm.  You could make your own estimates on the time taken depending on which points you consider as the start/end points !I wish all my fellow travellers and devotees a peaceful and fulfilling visit and darshan. Stay Blessed."
What a place,"I have gone to the temple of Thirupati, it’s an wonderful, clean, with perfect discipline, it has a  system to follow , it’s an awesome one, so big temple with most hygiene, every temple should follow its system ...lord venkatesa Dharshan is perfect"
Devotional ,"A trip to Tirumala with family, feels the devotional of Sri venketseshwar, excellent arrangement and security check were done by TTD."
Pathetic behaviour and abuse by temple guards with devotees,"The staff who stand in front of temple, keep pushing everyone specially women even when they are moving, shout at them for nothing and touch inappropriately. The moment of main darshan becomes horrible only because of the staff standing in front of God. As if every devotee is a beggar and has no respect. It's ridiculous why such harassment is been promoted by TTD management.peiple go there to see God and pray and the moment they r actually seeing God after so much waiting and crowd burst are pushed badly and thrashed for no reason. If this attitude doesn't stop, the women and families definitely will stop going."
Devotional Time with public,"I love visiting this temple, a world famous BALAJI temple located in Tirupati. I walked all the way from Tirupati from Alipiri side. They give us free darshan ticket for everyone who walks up to Tirumala with a limit of 10000 tickets per day. I started at 12.30AM so luckily I got darshan ticket for 8 AM. TTD also freely carries your luggage to Tirumala with some conditions on luggage contents. It took me a little less than 4 Hours to complete the hike, but if you are fit, you can easily complete it in 3 Hours time.But I had to wait for almost 2 Hours at different places to enter the temple. But once I entered the holy shrine, I forgot the whole waiting and inconvenience that I went through. The total time it took for darshan is very lucky 30 minutes once I entered the darshan queue. I love the Laddu prasadam so much that I ate almost half a Laddu in 5 minutes. The best part is I got a bus directly from Tirumala Bus stand to Airport, so my return journey was also pain-free. I shared a couple of photos of my route from Tirupati to Tirumala."
Must go to this temple,Old and ancient temple built with the stones such a peaceful temple of lord tirumala.The way for going to tirumala is also very very enjoyable and good.Sach a divine experience.
Good management,"The only issue is the crowd, they push you hard and it becomes panicky with young kids even after taking a special darshan ticket. The darshan was also not even for 2 seconds, atleast they should give sometime to pray....for everything there is a long queue. Parking facilities need to improve."
Lord Balaji Temple,"Temple is situated atop Tirumala hills, about 1hr distance by bus from Tirupati Bus Station. Waiting time for darshan can be few hours to few days. For paid darshan of 300, only online advance booking is allowed atleast 1 month before scheduled date. If carrying adhar cards, visitors can obtain entry passes on Tirupati bus stand as well and go to Temple just few hours prior to their alloted time slot. Arrangments inside temple are good and free milk and food is provided at regular interval for wating devotees. My waiting time was 28hrs in Feb2019."
Nice clean,The temple is nice & clean offering prasadams during morning & evening time. If you are in Tirupati you should not miss visiting to the temple.
If you have patience and stamina and devotion go there,"This is the highest visited place on the planet. You need to go online to ttd and register and get tickets online for darshan at Rs300/- . You need to report 30 minutes in advance at the gate. There is a huge que but orderly. They will check your id etc and there will be security checks all the way, about 5 in all with full body scan. Mobiles will be confiscated if carried. Worth the wait."
Tirumala Temple,"""Most famous place in India to visit for devotees who believe in god vishnu ,and very clean and superb place and temple.Jay Jay Govinda"""
Do Visit Brahmotsavam or Vasantotsavam to get experience of Lifetime,"I do book a ticket for Arijitha Brahmotsavam this time. Reached Tirupati a day ahead. Took locker but no use as they gave it for 24 hours only. Did Mundan from Main KalyanKatta. They directly asked for 201 rs for Mundan. Even locker counter they take 10 rs. Next day got to the hill barefooted. Attended Arijitha Brahmotsavam. Did not have a clue that there they will also try to sell prasadam and asked for money as ""Khushi"". Everything was hush.Sorry But I had to warn about that. Quite different from last time visit.But the arrangement By TTD was very nice. They put a wet red carpet on Mada streets so that people don't have to walk on the scorched stone floor. After Brahmotsavam, got to the Supatham and within 75 Minutes completed the Darshan. Actually, the man in front of me blocked the path in front of Balaji doing sasthang pranam. So I got a glimpse of Balaji for a full 1 minute. It was 4 30 at that time. So I went to Anna Prasadam. The evening meal was available from 5 pm and I had a nice meal with 10000 more people in the 3rd hall.Please get a Brahmotsavam ticket or Vasantotsavam ticket for a better experience. Go with traditional attire for these sevas."
Trip to Tirupati Balaji,I visited Tirupati Balaji along with my parents and had a good darshan. I booked special darshan online well in advance and it took us 2-3 hours for the entire darshan.The laddu prasadam is really tasty and one can buy extra laddus from the prasadam counter.
Devotional time ,Lot of things changed in the recent visit of  tirumala devastanams . More  devotee oriented programmes are taking place
Heaven on earth,"It is not just a temple, it is an experience which we will enjoy and cherish all our life. Best place to visit and must visit. We should always prefer to go by walk to the top from the bottom of the hill. It is an amazing experience of unity while we climb the steps."
Devotional,Devotional... excellent experience with peaceful environment. Lord balaji temple and all other surroundings will make you blessed.
Memorable Visit ,"Suggest you book online although u will require a clear 4- 5 hours for he visit .Be at the temple at the reporting time or probably a little earlier . Pros - very well managed temple , assistance available , seating areas during the queue helps a lot services to store bags / valuables .Cons - Money hungry priests who will ask u for money upfront , very rude ladies staff who will actually push u to move the queue forward , barely a couple of seconds for darshan , need to walk a lot to reach the ladies section Note - ladoos are very big - book ur order accordingly Carry water with you as the wait time can get really Long , wear Indian wear covering the arms & legs , suggest u wear slippers .Don’t expect a very Long and peaceful darshan and u barely get to see the Thr main idol , just a glimpse 🙂"
Positive and renewed energy,"I went for Tirupati-Tirumala darsan with Karnataka tourism packaged tour. They offer accommodation for fresh up, VIP darsan ticket and 2 laddoo prasad each person, within the package. It took almost 3 hours even in VIP darsan queue. But you forget all the waiting and time taken once you get darsan of lord Balaji. Maintain the dress code: Dhoti and shirt or Kurta pajama for men                                        Sari or salwar with dupatta for women"
Best feeling,I visited the temple few days back... Took a sarvdarshan ticket one day before and been able to have a darshan... Even it took 4 hrs to have the darshan but it was worth it
Divvya Darshanam ! Divine feeling for mind body and soul!,I went with the tamilnadu tourism one day trip. They were well organized and with the corporation of other passenger the day went well. The trip starts at 5 am at wallajah road chennai. Important things to carry photo id proof and tickets if booked online collect your tickets before you go to the bus. I had a name change which I did over the phone 2 days prior to the trip.  They give you a cute jute bag with a packet of biscuit and water. The guide Mr.Sridhar and pilot Mr.Arul were very helpful. The darshan I went was in March exam time so I guess that was a reason for less crowd.. The darshan was divine.the blessings I got was magical... you will just melt seeing balaji. Am felt so blessed to be there.. please visit balaji to get better changes in your life ... temple was clean.. plenty of water available to drink.. The nature resources are preserved.. you can see few animals on the way... beautiful for your eyes... mind and soul...
Blessed ,"One of the best temples and most importantly the city is clean..Important 1. Pre book VIP Darshan ticket INR 300 per person which also includes 2 Prasad ladoo free.2. Pre book your stay with the Tirumala. The Tirumala trust rooms as u will not find any other private accommodations options near by the temple.3. Book OYO if you have to stay at Tirupati for a night halt. Private rooms are just worst.4. It will take 1 hour from Tirupati to reach Tirumala where there is the main temple.5. Bags, mobile phones are not allowed in temple same as all big temples.At last the Darshan is divine.. best of bestJai Govinda Govindaa Govindaaaaaa Regards Tarun SamvediVirar Mumbai"
Piligrimage ,"Blessed to be in Tirupati, with Sri lone venkat Darshan though it was crowded but everything was maintained properly by TTd"
Amazing place to visit at least once a year..................,Who says you cannot see God on earth. God can be seen in Tirumala temple. Though the darshan is for few seconds but the experience is  amazing............
Govinda Govinda,Pilgrimage center of Lord Balaji. average daily visiting people is 70000. Lot of facility provided by Sandra govt. book online ticket for darshan and bring adhar card for verification. pay prayer at least one time in your life.
Amazing Temple,This is the one of the only Temple where you get postive vibes . The Idol of Lord Venkateswara is so attractive you cannot take you eyes of the same.
Supreme experience to see Lord Balaji,one of the most well managed and most beautiful temples in the country. Lord Balaji is supreme and there are no words to explain the experience of this once in lifetime visit. The temple sanctum sanctorum is atop the tirumala hill and is magnificient. The number of devotees is immense. I had to wait in line patiently for 2hours and 15 minutes(which is still quick) and have a great darshan of the Lord.  Very auspicious place and lots of positivity is felt. People around also are very kind.The TTD officials are very polite and very helpful.The famous tirupati laddoo is given as prasadam.the approach road to Tirupati temple is so beautiful and you can also walk from base of the hill to the top to get divya darshan.Govinda Govinda.
Tirupati Tirumala Darshan from Bangalore via APTDC - Terrible Dissatisfied Experience,"APTDC Bus No. 6271My parents are usual travellers to Tirumala/Tirupati for darshan and we always preferred to go by car.But this time, they preferred to go in organised tour and we chose APTDC instead of KSTDC which turned to be a wrong decision.They experienced following issues from the guide Mr. Vishnu once they reached Tirupati.1. Since the introduction the guide was very rude to the guests and his behaviour was very harsh2. He did not give any clarity about his roles3. He showed unnecessary urgency which we visited the destinations4. He did not allow us to buy extra laddus from the counter5. He was money minded - for example: he collected ₹800 for extra 10 laddus as against the actual cost of ₹5006. Two senior citizens arrived few minutes late because they found it difficult to find the bus stand in Tirumala and Mr. Vishnu scolded them very harsly in front of all the guests which was not necessary as he was not available to guide them to the bus.7. He did not give respect to any of the guests present there8. He did not allow anyone any time to shop and they did not guide a proper shopping place to buy9. He also collected money from few passengers for guidingIn summary, I DO NOT RECOMMEND APTDC Tirmala tour because even though we paid a hefty sum of appx. ₹2500 per seat, there was no satisfaction in the visit.Please do not go for this package unless APTDC assures of not having a guide like Mr. Vishnu"
Good durshan,"visited second time. nice arrangement by management.one thing to higilight for special entry darshan few staffs demanding aadhar card, it is no where mentioned in ticket. and in main counter they did nt ask. managemeny should clarify this. or else it wil create unnessary issues at last minute."
Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple  in Tirumala where millions throng to get His blessings.,"It was more than two decades ago when I visited Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) for the first time with my  family members from Chennai through a package tour by a bus. I can recollect the experience that I gathered as we entered a vast hall accommodating about 300 pilgrims at about 11.00 am & our Darshan was completed at 1.40 am at dead of night & returned back in Chennai. Then long time passed I could not manage to visit there from my home town. Presently I have to go to Vellore for some personal reason. Tirupati is 3-4 hours journey from Vellore by AP / TN bus. It is 24km from lower Tirupati / Tirupati Railway station to Tirumala. This year in January, 2019, I was to visit Vellore & I  decided to visit on 26th January to fulfill a long cherished desire of Darshan of Lord Balaji.  Thousands of pilgrims from all over the country throng here & wait for hours  just to have a Lord’s Darshan just for a moment. Tirumala Balaji temple is the World’s most visited temple where 30-40 millions of pilgrims assembled annually to seek His blessings.  It also the second richest temple in India second to Sri Padmanava Temple in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. On special occasions like the Brahmotsavam in September, the number of visitors reaches at 500000.Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple is situated in the hill town of Tirumala at Tirupati in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an incarnation of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from sufferings and troubles of Kaliyuga. The temple lies on the seventh peak -Venkatadri, Hence the temple is also referred to as ""Temple of Seven Hills"". The Garbagriha (Sanctum Sanctorum) is called Ananda Nilayam. The presiding deity, Venkateswara, is in standing posture and faces east in Garbhagriha. Here the deity is svayambhu (literally means the lord has come forth from the earth) in the form of an idol of stone but not a sculptured one. The Temple premises has two Queue complex buildings to organize the pilgrim rush, There is  Annaprasadam complex for free meals to Pilgrims,  so many guest house buildings.The day starts with the hymns of “ Suprabhatam”at 3.00am followed by continuous worship till “ Ekantha Seva” between 11.00pm to midnight. On 26th January, we reached lower Tirupati at noon & in the first gate the bag & baggage of each passenger was scanned & then started for moving on the hills . There are so many bends on the hilly path & at last we reached Tirumala at about 1.30pm. The environment, the air , the ambiance were changed soon. Thousands of pilgrims are here & there. We took a private car to reach our destination, Nandakam RH, .Time slot was 3 pm to 6 am within which we were to report with our Aadhar Card. The receipt was electronically generated& verified by the authority concerned just at 2.30 pm & was allotted a room on 2nd floor. The room was very nice & spacious. They cautioned us to vacate the room at just 6 am next morning without fail. We kept our bag etc & rushed to the Annaprasadam complex for prasad. Thousands of devotees took their lunch at a time at one batch.Then we came back to our room & took rest for 1 hour & again started at 4 pm for our next journey to report at ATC Car Parking Area as our Reporting time was 5 pm for the Darshan. We chose the slot at 5 pm as a Special Entry Darshan Pilgrim @ Rs.300/ per head. We booked on 09.10.18, more than 3 months in advance. Please note that the quota for Spl Entry Darshan at 5 pm on 26.01.19 was opened on 09.10.18 at just 12.00 noon, as notified in their website.As the exact entry gate was far off from our RH , we took a car to reach there as early as possible before 5 pm. At last we reached there , deposited our  mobiles in respective counter against a token & were standing in a Q along with other devotees. We moved slowly but steadily to reach the sanctum sanctorum. Though the Darshan was special, still there was rush, shoving among the pilgrims. There were waiting hall in the journey with shed above head, with fans, sitting arrangements. At last were able to reach before the Lord ,stayed for a few seconds . Before we fix our eyes with Him for a full view in our mind & eyes, we were dragged by the security to clear the crowd. It took abort 1.30 hours to complete the Darshan.I was speechless at the grandeur, the vastness, the beautiful temple of gold, the atmosphere, the crowd, the vast Q for other devotees after coming out as we were succeeded at last at our age 73.+ & 65. We are certainly blessed by the Lord as He wished that our visit should take place at His feet. Our next course of action was to collect 8 nos of Laddus . Any pilgrim under Spl Entry Darshan should get 2 laddus per head, but I paid for 4 laddus extra  as a Prasad for my relatives at home. But never did I think that I have to face a lot of problem to collect them as the barcode on the computer generated receipt did not match. They demanded me to produce the original Aadhar Card which was left behind in the RH. Finding no other means we had to come back again to our RH & ultimately we got the  laddus after producing the ID to them.Next we collected our mobiles from a counter , a little far off. We took our dinner from a hotel & were back in GH to take rest after a whole day’s tension, toil of journey & to leave the room at 6am.We vacated the room at the scheduled time & handed over the keys & left the RH  for return to Vellore. Coming out we took a taxi to visit some tourist spots on Tirumala hills , to visit Padmavati temple at Thiruchanoor  12km from lower Tirupati & finally to Kalahasti , another Shiva Temple, 38km from Tirupati Bus stand.In this context I cannot help sharing some myths on Lord Balaji-	Tonsure- As per a long standing tradition devotees coming to Tirumala offer their hair at Kalyankatta to please Lord Balaji before visiting for the darshan in token of sacrificing their false ego.  It is a century old ritual . Lord blesses his devotees who sacrifice their hair for the sake of Lord.	Namam or White Mark -Balaji's idol wears a white mark  of raw camphor that is so huge to cover the eyes. Thus, the devotees can see only a small part of the Lord's eyes while the rest  is covered. There is a significant reason why this is the procedure in the temple. Legend says there are two strange  miracles that happen in this temple to this day. There is a stream of water flowing from the feet of the idol called as Viraja River whose origin is not known so far. Also, several times it is noted that the Lord's body reports a huge rise in temperature up to boiling state. The several miraculous facts associated with the idol of Lord Balaji tell us how powerful the Lord is. Since the devotees cannot just withstand the powerful radiation emanating from the eyes of the Lord, the eyes are covered on most days excepting on Thursdays when the size of the white mark is relatively smaller enabling the devotees glimpse at the Lord's eyes to an extent.	Influx of Huge Money - The temple receives donations in large amounts. But why devotees pour wealth to the Lord Balaji ? The legend goes that Lord borrowed one crore fourteen lacs gold coins from Kuber for marrying Padmavati on the  condition that He would repay the interest only till the Kaliyuga ends & after that he would repay the principal amount & return to Vaikunta. He requested Lakshmi Devi to give His devotees wealth, fortune so that they can repay His debt & Lord will bless them.	Divine Gaze: It is believed that Lord ‘s eyes carry immense supernatural light that may not suit every one. According to some, they carry entire universe in them.	Magnetic: Devotees believe that Lord Srinivas has very magnetic or charming eyes that pull a devotee towards Him.Now I furnish some tips/ information for my fellow visitors for a hassle free Darshan of Lord Balaji.@ For Rs.50/ ticket holding devotees darshan may take 10-12 hours, heavy pressure, shoving among the devotees.@ It is better to book Spl Entry Darshan on line for  the time slot as per one’s convenience & availability.@ Please visit  official website for Spl Darshan. In the website it is clearly instructed when the desired date will be opened with the time details. But you are register yourselves first with your ID& Password otherwise you will not be allowed to access. You may book ticket for others also. The rate is Rs.300/ per person. The receipt they will send in your mail is self explanatory what to do & not to do.@ Please follow the dress code for the devotees in Spl Entry Darshan.@ Special Darshan is also available for physically disabled & senior citizens ( above65 years) through Dakshina Mada Street at 10am & 3pm subject to age proof by ID cards/ relevant medical certificate & shall report 2 hours earlier. One more person is allowed as  an accompanying person. The darshan can be completed within 2 hours.@ Govt.

I can recollect the experience that I gathered as we entered a vast hall accommodating about 300 pilgrims at about 11.00 am & our Darshan was completed at 1.40 am at dead of night & returned back in Chennai to avail my train at 9.00am in the morning. There was no means to come out from the chamber as it was a package tour. Then long time passed I could not manage to visit there from my home town. Presently I have to go to Vellore for some personal reason. Tirupati is 3-4 hours journey from Vellore by AP bus or TN us. It is 24km from lower Tirupati / Tirupati Railway station to Tirumala. If you travel by AP bus service you will get 20% concession in bus fare but you have to show your Govt. ID proof (preferably Aadhar Card) to the booking counter at Vellore New Bus Station. But please note that TN state bus will reach you only at Tirupati Bus Stand where as AP bus will reach you at Tirumala Bus stand. You can avoid the hazards by choosing AP bus. You can book your seat in advance also. There are various mode of transport, by bus, train, private car, flight etc. You can avail Air service at Tirupati & straight go to Tirumala.This year in January, 2019, I was to visit Vellore & I prepared my itinerary in such a way that I must visit on 26th January to have a long cherished desire of Darshan of Lord Balaji. Better you may say a glimpse of the Lord because the tight security will not allow you stay a few seconds rather they will drag you forcefully. Some preparations are required to fulfill your most awaited plan. I will narrate some information for easy  Darshan of Lord Balaji. Thousands of pilgrims from all over the country throng here & wait for hours after hours just to have a Lord’s Darshan just for a moment. Tirumala Balaji temple is the World’s most visited temple where 30-40 millions of pilgrims assembled annually to seek His blessings.  It also the second richest temple in India second to Sri Padmanava Temple in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. On special occasions like the Brahmotsavam in September, the number of visitors reaches at 500000.Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple is situated in the hill town of Tirumala at Tirupati in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an incarnation of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from sufferings and troubles of Kali Yuga.. The temple is also known by other names like Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple, Tirupati Balaji Temple. Venkateswara is known by many other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa.The Hills comprises seven peaks namely Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabhadri, Narayanadri and Venkatadri. The temple lies on the seventh peak -Venkatadri, on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. Hence the temple is also referred to as ""Temple of Seven Hills"". The Garbagriha (Sanctum Sanctorum) is called Ananda Nilayam. The presiding deity, Venkateswara, is in standing posture and faces east in Garbhagriha. Here the deity is svayambhu (literally means the lord has come forth from the earth) in the form of an idol form of stone but not a sculptured one. The Temple premises has two Queue complex buildings to organize the pilgrim rush, There is  Annaprasadam complex for free meals to Pilgrims, Kalyan Mandapam,  so many guest house buildings.The day starts with the hymns of “ Suprabhatam”at 3.00am followed by continuous worship till “ Ekantha Seva” between 11.00pm to midnight. On 26th January, we reached lower Tirupati at noon & in the first gate the bag & baggage of each passenger was scanned & then started for moving on the hills . There are so many bends on the hilly path & at last we reached Tirumala at about 1.30pm. The environment, the air , the ambience were changed soon. Thousands of pilgrims are here & there. We took a private car to reach our destination, Nandakam RH, Tirumala.Time slot was 3pm to 6am within which we were to report with our Aadhar Card. The receipt was electronically generated& verified by the authority concerned just at 2.30pm & was allotted a room on 2nd floor. The room was very nice & spacious. They cautioned us to vacate the room at just 6am next morning without fail. We kept our bag etc & rushed to the Annaprasadam complex for mid day meal. Thousands of devotees took their lunch at a time at one batch.Then we came back to our room & took rest for 1 hour & again started at 4.00pm for our next journey to report at ATC Car Parking Area as our Reporting time was 5pm on 26.01.19 for the Darshan. We chose the slot at 5pm as a Special Entry Darshan Pilgrim @ Rs.300/ per head. We booked on 09.10.18, more than 3 months in advance. Please note that the quota for Spl Entry Darshan at 5pm on 26.01.19 was opened on 09.10.18 at just 12.00 noon, as notified in their website.As the exact entry gate was far off from our RH , we took a car to reach there as early as possible befor 5pm. Atlast were reached there , deposited our bag & mobiles in respective counter against a token & were standing in a Q along with other devotees. We moved slowly but steadily to reach the sanctum sanctorum. Though the darshan was special, there was rush, shoving among the pilgrims. There were waiting hall in the journey with shed above head, with fans, sitting arrangements. At last were able to reach before the Lord ,stayed for a few seconds . Before we fix our eyes with Him for a full view in our mind & eyes, we were dragged by the security to clear the crowd. It took abot 1.30hours to completed the Darshan.I was speechless at the grandeur, the vastness, the beautiful temple of gold, the atmosphere, the crowd, the vast Q for other devotees after coming out as we were succeeded at last at our age 73.+ & 65. We are certainly blessed by the Lord as He wished that our visit should take place at His feet. Our next course of action was to collect 8 nos of Laddus . Any pilgrim under Spl Entry Darshan should get 2 laddus per head, but I paid for 4 laddus extra  as a Prasad for my relatives at home. But never did I think that I have to face a lot of problem to collect them as the barcode on the computer generated receipt did not match. They demanded me to produce the original Aadhar Card which was left behind in the RH. Finding no other means we had to come back again to our RH & ultimately we got the desired laddus after producing the ID to them.Next we collected our mobiles from a counter. We took our dinner from a hotel & were back in GH to take rest after a whole day’s tension, toil of journey & to leave the room at 6am.We vacated the room at the scheduled time & handed over the keys & left the RH  for return to Vellore. Coming out we took a taxi to visit some tourist spots on Tirumala hills , to visit Padmavati temple at Thiruchanoor  12km from lower Tirupati & finally to Kalahasti , another Shiva Temple, 38km from Tirupati Bus stand.In this context I cannot help sharing some myths on Lord Balaji-	Tonsure- As per a long standing tradition devotees coming to Tirumala offer their hair at Kalyankatta to please Lord Balaji before visiting for the darshan in token of sacrificing their false ego.  It is a century old ritual . Lord blesses his devotees who sacrifice their hair for the sake of Lord.	Namam or White Mark -Balaji's idol wears a white mark  of raw camphor that is so huge to cover the eyes. Thus, the devotees can see only a small part of the Lord's eyes while the rest Lord is covered. There is a significant reason why this is the procedure in the temple. Legend saysthere are two strange  miracles that happen in this temple to this day. There is a stream of water flowing from the feet of the idol called as Viraja River whose origin is not known so far. Also, several times it is noted that the Lord's body reports a huge rise in temperature up to boiling state. The several miraculous facts associated with the idol of Lord Balaji tell us how powerful the Lord is. Since the devotees cannot just withstand the powerful radiation emanating from the eyes of the Lord, the eyes are covered on most days excepting on Thursdays when the size of the white mark is relatively smaller enabling the devotees glimpse at the Lord's eyes to an extent.	Influx of Huge Money - The temple receives donations in large amounts. But why devotees pour wealth to the Lord Balaji ? The legend goes that Lord borrowed one crore fourteen lacs gold coins from Kuber for marrying Padmavati on the  condition that He would repay the interest only till the Kaliyuga ends & after that he would repay the principal amount & return to Vaikunta. He requested Lakshmi to give his devotees wealth, fortune so that they can repay his debt & Lord will bless them.	Divine Gaze: It is believed that Lord ‘s eyes carry immense supernatural light that may not suit every one. According to some, they carry entire universe in them.	Magnetic: Devotees believe that Lord Srinivas has very magnetic or charming eyes that pull a devotee towards him.	There is a secret village, approximately 23 Kms from the temple in Tirumala, where no one is allowed except the residents of the village. The people are said to be living with strict practices and tradition. It is from this village, that all the flowers, milk, ghee, butter are offered for the God.Now I furnish some tips/ information for my fellow visitors for a hassle free Darshan of Lord Balaji.@ For Rs.50/ ticket holding devotees darshan may take 10-12 hours, heavy pressure, shoving among the devotees.@ It is better to book Spl Entry Darshan on line for  the time slot as per one’s convenience & availability.@ Please visit  official website of TTD  for Spl Darshan.@ Rs.300/ per person. @ Please follow the dress code for the devotees in Spl Entry Darshan.@ Special Darshan is also available for physically disabled & senior citizens ( above 65 years) at 10 am & 3 pm subject to age proof by ID cards/ relevant medical certificate & shall report 2 hours earlier. One more person is allowed as  an accompanying person.@ Govt. ID must be produced in original.@ Sometimes the barcode on the computer print- out may not read, then original ID proof  has to be produced ,@ Accommodation is not allowed to a single person.@ You may visit other places on the hills of  tourist interest , viz, Silatoranam 2km from Tirumal, Akasa Ganga,2km from Tirumala etc...."
GOD all prevalent,Lord Venkateswara is my family God. We worship him everyday and visit his abode atleast once a year. The benevolent deity compels you to look at him and forget yourself. The deity and the temple are beyond description
Tirumala visit,"Every time I visit the Srinivasa Perumal at the Tirumala shrine, I get mesmerised by His grandeur. The entering was as usual a painfully slow process with waits at several places en route. But once in, one can feel the magnificent presence of the Lord;."
Tirupathi the Turning Point,"Tirumala Tirupathi Dewasthanam temple is a world wide known Hindu temple. The Grace of Lord Venkateswara is universal as everyone knows about the temple and the deity. People who go there, will experience a good turning point in their life be it, marriage in the family, promotion in career etc. You don't have to seek favours. Instead the Lord bestows it on you, reading your mind. But sincerity and faith in him is a must. I have my personal experiences.The temple activities are round the clock, barring a few minutes when the Lord is allowed rest. But he does not rest but continues his blessings. You may be in the sanctum hall for a few seconds but his grace encircles you. You have the feeling that what for you waited is worth. We had been there many times, latest being from 28.02.2019 to 01.03.2019. The archa form of Lord still is in our eyes."
Most Visited Temple,"A Must Visit to this Temple ""At Least Once"" to Get The Divine Blessings of the Lord...... The Devoted Crowd from various states tells it all. We visited the same in February thro KSTDC Bangalore / Tirupati conducted tour and had a very good Darshan of the lord. It is truly a Divine experience.The darshan is now very convinient either thro various conducted tours or going there individually. One can now visit at any time convinient and can book a slot in the special paid catogory (Rs 300/-) which will enable to get a darshan within 2hrs max. Senior citizens / handicapped person's has various benefits and a seperate free darshan, which is at 10am and 3pm daily. (Reportng is 2hrs prior to above time)Strict Security checks for electronic gadgets are in force and advised not to carry the same. However we carried some snacks, water and personal belongings which are allowed. One has to follow the dress code for the Darshan.More details one can visit TTD website."
Very mis-managed place,"We went to Tirumala at the end of January. There are two types of tickets to enter the temple - free entry and 300 Rs entry. We missed to get the 300 Rs ticket online, hence, we joined line to get the ticket since 5.30 in the morning. The counter opens at 8 am but if you don't join the queue early, there is no chance for you to get a ticket. Because number of tickets per day is 700 only and number of devotees is in Thousands.We got the time slot of 1 pm for which we joined the temple entree queue at 11.30 am where they deposited our Mobile phones and footwears and then started our ordeal without food, water or any other facilities for 4-5 hours continuous standing and walking in the queue bare feet on hard floor. We had a very good view of the deity and could pray for very good time which was the highlight of the trip. We were exhausted when we came out but we had to collect Prasad which was a different queue without any directions or person understanding our language. It took another hour to get the Prasad and then started the ordeal of getting our mobile phones and footwears back again without any directions or person understanding our language. After 1 hour and climbing 50 odd stairs and walking a long distance we finally got our stuff back. But we were so exhausted that we could not find courage to go have free food which required another 50 stairs up and down. You should Tirumala only if you are a real devotee because going there for the sake of visiting the place is not worth it. A very important tip - Darshan of Venkatesh Swami is not completed without the darshan of lake and God Garun both of which can be seen on the way up. And his second wife Padmavati Devi whose temple is in Tirupati. So, make sure that you visit all of these."
The ultimate Bliss!!,"We were lucky to get the tickets for break Darshan- Line 1- and today the Lord was adorned with Diamond Jewellery!! We got Aarti, Teerath and Shatkop!! And standing right in front of God!! Amazing and unreal !!"
Great,Must go placesThe whole place has a special aura and it is cleanThe administration is working effortlessly to make the process as smooth as possible
Lost God here.,"Having grown detached to religion over the last few years, my wife, friends, and family told me of a temple where there was a richness of shakti, Tirupathi Mandir. They insisted, there, I might find the spark I needed to reignite my faith. So on my next trip to India, we scheduled a trip to Tirupathi. Overall, I simply do not understand the fascination. At one time, there may have been a powerful experience as one walked the long, darkened hall and approached the Moorthis glowing in the light of diyas. I can see how this might create an emotional experience. For VIPs and premium ticket holders there is a 2-3 hour wait in a winding, endless que. I am fortunate to be able to afford the premium experience. It was a daylong wait if you have limited means or no influence. When you finally approach the Moorthis, anticipating some blessed profound moment, you are shoved along by attendants and not able to stop even for a second (I mean this very literally). What a painful build-up to a big let-down. Yes, I understand that thousands of others are also waiting. However, if this is how it must be, then what is the point of doing this? After the ""Darshan"" I was flung some parshad like I was a beggar and then went to another line where I waited 30 minutes for a laadu, which was being manually cataloged into a computer and matched with your ticket for some reason. It took several minutes to complete the transaction. (My god, it is a laadu, not a large bank withdrawal.) I was tempted to just leave and forego the laadu, but the rest of the family insisted on getting the blessed laadus. Overall, with the crowd and additional structures designed for crowd management, the architecture and original experience are completely lost. To boot, once we left the mandir, in the main square, there were elephants on display in ankle chains, so that tourists can take photos or receive a ""Jumbo"" sized blessing. The elephant is raising it’s trunk because it is trained and forced to do so, this is not a blessing. It does not come from the heart or a place of love. Look at the chains on its feet! I don’t care how well cared for the elephants are, ankle chains tell you everything. The exploitation of these poor animals was reflective of the overall management of the Temple. Make money wherever possible and in as mechanized a fashion as possible. My faith in religion (and god) has been weakening for some time and this place nearly killed it. I am convinced that any godly experience a pilgrim has here is something that they brought with them for home. The Mandir is so crowded, overdeveloped and rushed, unless you already come with deep faith in your heart, this will be a disappointment. I walked away forsaking all religion and solidifying my perception that religion is overly commercialized and exploitative. Instead of making an additional donation at the end of the Tirupathi puja, I decided I would use the allocated money to give generously to the taxi drivers, servers and artisans who I would meet during my trip, I derived much more pleasure giving to these people who made my trip enjoyable and memorable. I only wish I could have saved the money spent on visiting Tirupathi and donated it to a worthwhile charity instead. Later in my India trip, I visited Rishikesh and attended a Ganga side Puja. I did not want to attend but my daughter insisted I go. There, I attended a wonderful Puja and was suddenly struck by the life-giving power of the Ganga and felt an unexpected connection to something primordial. There, I may have found a bit of what I was originally seeking in Tirupathi. It also confirmed to me that god is where you choose to find him. There is no need to suffer needlessly through assembly line prayers and enrich already wealthy pujaris like a mindless drug addict."
Tirupati Balaji Darshan,"Lord Balaji Darshan is always Magical. It is his divine grace that I pulled every year for Lord’s Darshan.Must visit Pilgrimage of India. Most systematic, amazingly clean and maintained Temple and Tirumala Town.Tirumala is the town where Tirupati Balaji’s Temple is situated on the mountain. Tirupati is the city down under the hill.Book Darshan using TTD website, come in prescribed dress, ID cards and be present at check point on time for hassle free Darshan. If you are carrying small kids below 5 yrs, you can carry biscuits, milk, chocolate, water bottle and diapers etc. required to keep your baby/kid engaged for during waiting time.Take your kid in your lap while entering the Main Temple so that you kid can also see Lord Balaji.Put your dan in the Hundi at prescribed location and yes collect your World Famous Tirupati Laddu’s from Laddu counters, if possible carry your own cloth covers.There are many Car Parkings like ATC Car Parking and Ram Bagicha Car Parking. I prefer Ram Bagicha as when you come out of temple through Ram Bagicha you need not to walk much in bare foot.Hope I covered all important aspects, have a blessed Darshan Chant “Jai Govinda ...”."
Feels like your are in heaven,I had been to the temple since my childhood on an early basis. When i see the preceding deity lord Venkateswara I feel so pleasant and my mind find its peace despite hundreds of people chanting the names of deity.
Majestic!,"Tirumala temple situated on top of Tirumala hill is a temple we should definitely visit at least once in our life time. It's simply majestic.From Tirupati downhill it is around one hour travel.We can go by private vehicle, taxi cabs or dedicated  public transportation which is very frequent. Accomodation can be booked through temple website,but it used to be full most of the days.Lot of private hotels are available downhill in Tirupati which are very convenient too.There are different mode for darsan. Most convenient is  sheegra darsan which can be booked online in advance by paying Rs.300/- per head  through their website."
The Richest God - Venkateswara Temple,"We reached Tirupati at 10:15AM. We already decided not to take our traveller to Tirumala for reason mainly the driver is new to Tirumala and may not reach the spot without wasting time. So, we reached the TTD parking place in Tirupati (parking is free there) and parked the traveller there. The moment we entered the parking area, one sumo driver approached us with the deal to carry all of us to the top and showing 5 temple points including Tirumala and asked Rs.350 per head. We didn't have time to spend all the time at Tirumala hence we settled for Rs.300 per head only to visit Tirumala and drop us back to the parking area.So, we started our journey on his old Sumo (bit difficult to accommodate 11 people (including the driver) and started climbing the hill. At the entrance there was a security check for which we all have to get down from the vehicle, walked down for a scan/security check and then the vehicle will be checked without any baggage or people in it and then passengers will have to board again after the security check was over .Among our group, there was a senior Citizen (65 year old - as per TTD), so the driver first stopped at Senior citizen queue area and guided the Senior citizen guy and his wife and then took us to the next spot where we all have to enter (Rs.300 ticket holders). We left all our footwears on the Sumo and the driver already shown our guys where he will be parked and how to reach there after Darshan.It took about 3 hours to get Darshan and came out to collect free laddu's. After collecting the laddu's, we all went to the Annandanam hall and had annadanam (nice food). Finally, located the sumo driver and came down to Tirupati parking area around 4:30PM. We were told that seating arrangements are available along the queue but we all had to stand all the time in the queue which was moving slowly. But Senior Citizens get good treatment. They get place to relax and some food and water was served. They have to pay Rs.70 each and get 4 laddu's each, whereas those who have taken Rs.300 ticket were given only  2 laddu's per ticket.Not sure about free Darshan people, but definitely it may take more time - anything from 4 hours to 8/10 hours..?"
Nice place for devoties,"I was enjoyed lots of entertainment with my family and my cousins ,it’s like wild life feeling I felt"
Spiritually uplifting journey,"The temple premises are praiseworthy with all amenities taken care of including clean toilets, water etc.. the Darshan is heavenly and you feel an instant connection with the Lord , the waiting time may be longer on weekends but the wait is worth it and don’t forget to chant Govinda with the other devotees if you want to make use of the waiting time. If possible try to go on weekdays when waiting time is much lesser , we completed the Darshan in 45 minutes. You can either book the Tirumala accommodation in advance much preferred since you don’t have to travel from the city to the hill. But if staying in city then catch the free ride to the temple from the main bus depot"
Pick a right day and enjoy,"Tirupati temple is always crowded with devotees. Still, you can find less-crowded days such as a weekday, non-festival day and less popular timing of late afternoon. The combination worked for us and we enjoyed our darshan experience.Suggested timing: Lunchtime (1 PM onwards)Suggested Day: Mon-ThursdayWe could finish our darshan in 2 and a half hours and had a delicious Anna Prasadam followed by tonsuring. There was absolutely no crowd and you could run with ease.A sample plan-------------------    Book the special darshan tickets at least a month in advance. Choose a weekday and non-festival day to expect a lower crowd.    Choose a time for darshan and try to reach before that. The special darshan queue has a slot based system and you should follow your slot.    We had planned to use a personal vehicle for travel and it had many benefits such as shorter travel time, ease of keeping stuff (bags, footwear, phones etc). Besides we would visit Shri Kalahasti Temple too.    After reaching Tirumala hilltop, you need to report at the ATC Car parking area as mentioned on the darshan ticket. Alternatively, always ask the duty policemen for any direction.    You must leave all the electronics and bulky items. There are lockers just as the entry of the special darshan point.    Carry a printout of the darshan ticket as you would not have access to phones. In case you forgot to carry a hard copy, there is a printer shop. Ask policemen for direction.    You can carry water, food and small stuff for kids and yourself in a backpack. It will be screened multiple time, so please leave all electronics and metal items in a locker.    You would need to follow the route which has many rooms joined by metal corridors.    It is a well-maintained route, with good ventilation, and wall-mounted fans. The queue has max 2 people width so looks safe.    Never run while waiting. Just stay calm and try to be on the sides of the queue.    There are toilets on the way. The only problem is that you would use them bare-foot. And there is no soap so you should carry it.    In a few hours, you would reach the main temple.    After exiting, there are a couple of more temples and you can plan to visit them if you’ve time.    You must try Anna Prasadam which is a food distribution service run by TTD.    All restaurants on the hill are managed by TTD and you can expect a good meal at extremely low prices."
Home town of gods,"I went to tirupati many times with my friends and family members. The last I went to tripati with my friends. we reached the railway station in tirupati. It was very big but not so clean. As it is tourist place the streets infront of railway station are filled with dirt. There are many shops selling worship items along the way. We went to bhimas residency hotel to reside for 4 days. I think the tirupati is the city of hotels and lodges. in our hotels area there are at least 20 small and big hotels bhimas paradise residency, dieluze and bhimas. On that evening we went to sri Goviddaraja swamy temple in centre of the town. It was very charming with number of shops infront of it. The decoration of that temple was very nice. there was a Museum in front of that temple, There some nice collections of the king of tirupati. The next day we went to koneru located on front of the govindaraja temple. we also went to rtruchanur and alivela managapuram. padmayathi and alivelu managamma are located in tiruchanur and alivela mangapuram respectively, in the middle of them loard yenki resides in Tirumala we also wnt to book our tickets in alipiri and visited kapila thirtham. It is the temple of siya with waterfalls in it. the s very beautiful temple I ever seen. On that day evening we went to a film called pournami in tirupati in group theatres. It was a group of more than 7 theatres playing different films. that has gone 10.00 pm and to the hotel to take some rest. we woke up the next day morning and went to Tirumala to see lord yenkateshwara. It has gone over 4 hours. lord que we saw his clearly, Tirumala was very rush and very small. we returned to tirupati at 4.00 pm and we took rest that day and went to kalahasti too see lord siya the next morning. there are more than one thousand lingas of siya. its koneru was very beautiful. and we returned to Hyderabad by train that day evening. overall, the tirupati was the city of number temples and hotels. crime is everywhere in the universe, in the lord yenki’s home town it is somewhat more so be careful in your trip of tirupati.enjoy the faith of god but don’t forget to rate this review, any rating can be accepted by thuis man."
Ultimate Devotion ,We visited lord venkateswara on special tickets. Weather was too cool around 12-15 degree celcius. Temple is neat and clean offers all facilities to the public
Lord Venkateswra !,"One of the world famous Hindu temples situated in Andhrapradesh,this balaji temple is really worth visiting for beautiful mountain ranges, waterfalls and above all the idol “ Lord sri venkateswara”"
Very spiritual temple...peaceful surroundings,"As you enter the Tirumala hills , the nature takes over....The green hills and winding roads offer serene landscape . The approach roads are very well managed and secure. The temple entry and way to inner temple ring where the actual balaji temple is very well monitored and secure with toilets and water points is provided. The Darshan of Balaji is very pleasing and content. The single visual of few seconds is heart pleasing. Thank you to TTD for making such good arrangements"
Beautiful temple,One of the beautiful temple I visited in my life is tirumala temple. I entered the Temple at 9:00pm and finally got god darshana around 11:30 to 11:50pm and I enjoyed the que because in between the que u will get enough food and also the rush is low in the night time. So if u want to see god in less time then visit the Temple at night time.
High spiritual place,Excellent temple of the lord . Totally  as you go inside the temple you start feeling  the  divine vibration .
Very good darshan,We took the sarva darshan tokens and then went to Tirumala total time taken was 3.5 hours. We were made to wait in a hall for an hour. Post which we had the most bhavya darshan. We were told that the best day for a crowd less darshan is wednesday.
Bhagwan ke darshan,"Sri Lakshmipati Balaji templeSituated in Tirumala, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh.India's richest trust. Richest Hindu temple.Must visit once if u r nearby Andhra."
One of the Greatest of the Hindu Religious site,"This place does not require any introduction and is one of most sacred place in Hinduism. Place is thronged by Hindus from all over the world in large numbers. There are long queues for the Lord's 'Darshan'. Considering the number of people visiting the temple everyday, the overall arrangement made for the pilgrims is very good. While visiting the temple, the 'Laddus' which has the Geographical Indication Tag and are distributed as 'Prasad' are not to be missed."
No Religious Place in the World as Satisfying and as well organised as Tirumala Temple,"It was the young German couple whom we met in the ""Queue"" for taking ""Darshan"" of Lord Venkateshwara that made me think yet again of the fame of this massive Temple, or Temple Complex or what can be described by no other word than the reference for such places - ""Tirtha Kshetra"" in Hinduism. (Sacred Town / place, the closest that English Language can reach, doesnt have an iota of what a ""Tirtha Kshetra"" means!) I have similarly put ""Darshan"" also in quotes. Because, the word translates in English as ""View""!! So Oxford has painstakingly added this explanation:- Quote ""An opportunity to see or an occasion of seeing a holy person or the image of a deity. ‘Hindus attach great importance to a darshan, or view, of a saint or holy image’"" Unquote So it is difficult for anyone to 'review' the Temple of Lord Venkateshwara that is located on the hills of Tirumala near the temple town of Tirupati in state of Andhra Pradesh in India. To have that experience, our well advised German couple therefore decided to visit the Temple and take Darshan themselves to experience the power of this 'tirtha kshetra'. It is said that it is difficult to get a Darshan of the Lord. He chooses whom he can give Darshan. There are people who plan to visit the Temple for months in advance and then there are people who just get inspired for some reason or the other, or suddenly get a holiday which makes a perfect long weekend for a visit to Tirupati and therefore pack their bags and leave the house and end up getting a fantastic Darshan of the Lord. Let's be very very clear about one aspect. Millions visit the temple every year. Lakhs of visitors sometimes in a day. But the crowd management is the best in the world. Except for the few metres just before entering the main ""Garbha"" or sanctum, everything is smooth. It may require few hours of waiting for your turn. You keep walking through mazes of security lines and large areas(called compartments) where you probably will wait for 20-30 minutes each before you get back again walking through the maze till the next compartment. And again wait and so on. But you can chat up with people who have come from different parts of the country and you will make friends for the few hours that you are with them and all of them would be separated by the time you enter the sanctum. After that, if you don't plan to meet, you won't. Some quick facts that can help a traveller who is reading this on Trip Advisor:- (a) Howmuchsoever be the crowd, whatever peak season it may be, if you reach at Tirupati, you will get the Darshan. Period. Just keep a tab on the Darshan time on the website and keep a day extra. I am repeating this ""one day extra"" later in the review. There is a website that will help you that belongs to the authorised board that facilitates visitors and I have listed in the list of websites section.(b) If you can plan, book the Darshan online. The search for ""ttd seva"" on Google will get you the information It is preferable if you can do it few weeks in advance for normal days and four months in advance for important days (auspicious days, New Year Day, Long weekends, Festivals such as Diwali, etc) (c) Try to stay in some accommodation arrangement at Tirumala. Tirupati is a burgeoning city / town and it cannot match the serene ambience at Tirumala. (d) Look for accommodation in various ""Mutts"" at Tirumala. (e) Travelling between Tirupati to Tirumala is easy. A cab will charge about Rs 2000- 2500 for hiring for full day. (f) NRIs / Foreigners / Defence personnel with I cards etc have a separate queue system. Foreigners can visit by signing a form that says something to the effect that although you are not a Hindu, you have faith in Lord Venkateshwara. Please read through the rules on website. (g) Senior citizens have a separate queue system. (h) Sometime, when the crowds are unmanageable, they stop all special entry Darshans. But I have visited on 29 Dec 18, almost peak period in the year and they hadnt closed it. (i) You can walk up to Tirumala, it takes about 6 hrs from one route and about 3 hrs from a shorter route. You get priority Darshan, if you do so. (j) The crowds may overwhelm you for a few minutes while entering the ""Garbha"", but do not let that distract you from having a focused darshan of the Lord. You will get about 6-7 seconds of view as you walk towards the Deity, especially if you are tall enough to look over the heads of the fellow devotees in the queue ahead of you. And when you reach right in front, with nobody else between you and the deity, just absorb as much as you can. You will probably get half a second to watch the Deity in this condition, before you are whisked away.(k) You get ""Laddoos"" as ""prasad"", food offered to the God which is then consumed by devotees. The laddoos are available at dedicated ""Laddoo Counters"" series of about 20counters in a complex approximately five minutes walk from the main ""Garbha.""  However, remember that if you want to buy extra laddoos for people back home, then before walking towards the ""Laddoo counters, buy tokens for extra laddoos just after exiting the main Garbha. (l) Lord Varahaswamy had helped Lord Venkateshwara for his marriage. Therefore Lord Venkateshwara gave him a boon that a devotee's prayers will be answered only if he visits Lord Varahaswamy temple before having darshan of Lord Venkateshwara!! So please do that. The Temple of Lord Varahaswamy is just a few hundred metres from the main temple of Lord Venkateshwara. (m) Goddess Padmavati, wife of Lord Venkateshwara has her temple at Tirupati. Please visit that too, (n) Additionally there is a nice Science museum near Tirupati, so kids can have a good time there too. (o) Keep one day extra in your plan for Tirupati and spend the extra day at Tirumala. You wont regret it. The ambience will make you want to extend the stay anyway. So trust me on this. The additional day would be very well spent. To sum up the long review, our German Friends from Berlin, clad in Indian Traditional clothes as per the temple rules, managed to wait for the one hour and a half in the queue system for the Darshan. Obviously we couldn't meet them afterwards. They were looking radiant all through, soaking in the electric atmosphere. And we were radiant too, on being blessed to get the Darshan of the Lord, those 6-7 seconds being etched on our memories. And we exited with tears of reverence in our eyes, looking for the laddoos for my little son! And in the background, the crowd roared with the chants of ""Tirupati Venkatramana Govinda.... ""GOOO...VINDAAA"""""
Wonderful darshanas,The Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala is a life time experience to visit . The Tirumala city on the hill is very clean and beautiful with great facilities for the pilgrims . One must get darshana bookings done online in advance since everyday it's huge rush at the temple . The process of booked darshanas is very well organized and it takes 2 hours from start to finish .
Most revered temple for Hindus,Tirumala temple is the most revered and sacred temple of Lord Venkateswara in Tirupati.Only thing is the special treatment for pilgrims with special darshan ticket which gives preference to people who can afford.
The highest spiritual experience,"Probably the most visited temple in India, and certainly the best organised as far as devotees are concerned. We visited it in January 2019, having booked sheegra darshan a month earlier.we were lucky to get a 4 PM slot. We went in at 3:45 PM and were out after darshan at 7:00 PM.  The process was very well organised and controlled considering the number of devotees waiting. We came out satisfied spiritually and emotionally. Three hours in queues may be tiring, but everything was orderly and well regulated. There were drinking water points, restrooms. and places to sit and wait. being seniors we were tired at the end, but have no complaints.We were advised not to go during school holidays as the number of devotees would be much bigger. I think that was a valid advice.I do not think a wheelchair bound person could manage what we did. Maybe there are special routes for them with ramps and elevators."
A Divine intervention,"This temple is among the most holiest temple of the Hindus.The place is always crowded because of its significance.I would suggest to buy special darshan ticket from ttd seva online website for rs 300 per head. Even with this ticket ,get prepared to stand in queue for atleast 2-3 hrs . You will always get 2 ladoos in this ticket. Also one should definitely try the food at Anna prasadam at free of cost."
Tirumala - Real life changing Place.. ,No words to say.. Words cannot describe it give our the real feelings of anyone.. Come atleast once in your life and you could see a difference in your life.. First visit the varahasamy temple on the bank of the temple pond. Then visit Tirupati temple.. Then if time permits do visit A) Sila thoranam B) Nija Paatha Darshan ..For the above two places you could get jeeps easily for rent...
Visit the temple,Must visit..what more can one say about this holy place?Book rooms in advance else u will end up paying more
Extremely unhelpful people,"It is a place full of rude, arrogant and unhelpful people. I went with a lot of hope. But turns out this place is only for the very rich or very poor and not for anybody else. The numerous signboards dont provide any real information. One pilgrim facilitation center only provided rate card handouts for various poojas and sevas instead of providing any useful information to queries. Mobile phones - your most personal property- is taken away from you. Language is the biggest issue. It is very difficult to take or receive help if you are not aware of the local language. As per temple rules, luggage is not allowed inside the temple but it is not specified whether purses or wallets (which contain our cash and valuables) are included or excluded from the definition of ""luggage"". The free buses do not display any route information, so again we have to ask someone and again bear with the possibility of getting reply in unknown language. Different types of darshan make it very difficult to decide as to which among them is better. A shocking and nightmarish experience."
Superb,It's an amazing to visit temple at this winter season..... Its an very cold location with beautiful different types tress with different colours of flowers
Good darshan at Tirumala,We went on a working day (Monday). The crowd was not at it's peak since it's month of October and it's an working day. Had a divine feeling throughout the enroute to the main temple(via 'Q' complex) and feeling blessed to have a nice darshan.
Tirumala,"Tirupati,Andhra pradesh Lord perumal temple in Tirupati Tirumal .many of them people are going to visit temple."
tirupati darshan,visited tirupati in december had a good darshan main problem area is managing of the crowd near the main temple. Since the temple earns so much there are still lack of tourist facilities & management. There is a great problem of letting pilgrims do darshan in front of the lord they dont let you stand in peace in front of the lord imagine coming from far away spending so much money & doing darshan in nano seconds is unjust. The trust should think about this. The size of laddoo has also reduced drasiticaly inspite of increase in revenue of the trust is not justified. The management of distribution of ladoos also need to be upgraded scientificaly.
Must Visit Temple in Life Time,"One of Most sacred place on earth! You can reach tirumala by foot steps(2 ways)/Bus/car. Dharshans(Visiting Sacred Tomb) are different types. Free Dharshan, Special Darshan etc., Also you can avail special pooja tickets on TTD official Website."
one of the most sacred places on earth,Words can't express the experience of Balaji darshan as the self just disappears in divine. Book quick darshan tickets online and be at the entrance gate at right time with identity proof.
Divine and serene place,Wonderful and very well maintained temple. Good Darshan with the special darshan ticket. Lot of buses to the temple from the foothills
Get the blessings of Lord,"Tirumala is one of the richest & most well maintained temple in the world. They offer Sarva Darshan tickets apart from ticket for those who climb the steps (Alipiri & Srivari mettu). You also can book for ₹300 tickets in advance where you’ll be given a specific time to report at ATC Car Parking area.If there isn’t much crowd, you need not have to get the token. Aadhaar or any other Govt ID like DL/Passport/Pan Card is must which will be verified.If you’re going in ₹300 ticket, ensure you wear a dhoti/kurta/pyjama.The shrine also offers stay facilities but please book it prior to avoid disappointment especially during festive season.You can also see “Anna Prasadam” counters which are free food service offered by the TTD. You can eat them without giving a second thought.There are free bus services available which is red in colour & looks like a chariot which will take you from the railway station to the hill and these are available in hill as well echovme h will drop you closer to temple or to the bus stop(to go down). Otherwise a single way ticket from the bottom of the hill to go to Tirumala would cost ₹55 for adult & ₹30 for kid. If you book two way, you only have to pay ₹100.If you’re going on your own vehicle, kindly ensure that you do not ride/drive too fast especially while climbing down because your timing is tracked & if you’re reaching earlier than prescribed time(45 mins), you’ll be fined. Not many are aware of this."
Always Crowded - Seniors and NRI's can avoid long queues,"This temple is unique in a way that you can't jus go, unless you are destined to.Expect large crowds on a daily basis and extra large crowds on special occasions. On an average there are 75000 people coming into the temple. On occasions it touches 100-120K our day. Hence the queue time is longer and you get 5-8 seconds to have a view of the lord. Senior citizens have special timings and NRI (with proper documents) can cut the queue by large. I queued with two little kids for less than 2 hours, whereas the normal timing for Darshan due to school holidays in Dec was 1.5 to 2 days."
Most visited template or shrine in the world,"This is one of the most visited temple shrines in India.  The temple is always crowded in all seasons.  Make sure you book you stay in advance to take advantage of the facilities provided by the temple trust, amenities like the stay and food are pretty decent for any type of visiter"
Divine Experience with a excellent travel plan with KSTDC,"I used to visit Tirumala temple frequently and somehow in the last 10 years i couldnt make it. As the calling comes by divine, we decided to visit immediately and since we stayed outside India the option of booking online was there and we couldnt find any tickets available for next 3 months. However we took a call and with a hope landed in Bangalore after which we checked couple of packages and KSTDC was the only choice we could see as we wanted to visit Kalahasti too. We went ahead and booked this package. If you need Kalahasti then this package is from every friday to sunday. Super reasonably priced it was just Rs 3500 per person. I didnt really expect much but the journey was excellent. First thing i loved is the timing ! Absolutely on time every where, super discipline on timings made us get the darshan on time without much of a hassle. This package was inclusive of special darshan tickets hence we hardly spent around an hour in the que. We visited Padmavati temple, Govindaraj temple, Kapilathirta along with Tirupati Balaji. Not to forget this package also included boarding facility in a very decent hotel at the foot of tirumala. This was the first time i felt the darshan to Tirupati was so peaceful and hassle free .  Tirupati darshan was so serene and we could see Lord Balaji atleast for a minute without any push and pull with the crowd . Divine blissful experience i am grateful for ."
Danger Dont Visit with Your Family and kids Its Battle Group At Temple And Worst Maintains There,"Danger Dont Visit with Your Family Its Battle Group At Temple And Worst Maintains There there is no proper line no one we found no one to maintain Q (Line) it was 4 hours of battle your kids may be crushed or can die due to suffocation god is everywhere i dont think it is compulsory to visit there and i will never ever visit there again in my life temple having 2,00,000 of corers equal to 28,56,80,00,000.00 United States Dollar but they dont have respect for the pilgrimage The temple owners just want to eat money and sleep The temple is a biggest scam of all time in this history of univers"
Once in a Life Time Divine Experience,"Thirumal Hillsa,Abode of Lord Venkateswara isone of the important Piligrim Centres of South India. It is always Crowded and on Festive Days Devoteed have to wait for hours to have a Darshan of the God. Unlike many other temples you can view the Deity only for a Few Minutes and there is no Special Puja you can offer to the Main Deity.Pujas are performed only for Utsava Murthy. We went in December engaging a Chauffer Driven Car from Chennai.The Tour Operated arranged for Special Darshan( Costs Rs300 per Head) and we could finish Darshan in Two Hours,No words can describe the Mesmerising Spell the Deity Casts on you.It has to be experienced.The Temple is well maintained and the Temple Authrities are doing all that they could do to make the experience of Devotees pleasant. Must Visit."
Pray,Great experience despite everything seemed to be money minded.we booked a car with driver and did the whole experience .overall was great
Wonder of Wonders,No Elevation is enough to describe the Supreme Lord Venkateswara Swamy Temple. A Definite must see for all Hindus atleast once in their Life Time.
Precious,"No words to explain the satisfaction Within ourselves on reaching this place. You will have to wait for a long time for Darshan. But it is worth it. As a precaution, Its better to book for the Darshan online through website. Further, Keep your shoes inside your bag to keep safe as you may have to wait longer. Keep calm n wait. At the end Darshan will satisfy you totally. Sri Venkateswara will fullfill all your wishes."
Great experience,Great to walk around the Mada streets around the temple - very well maintained.  We had made a booking for a special darshan  of Rs. 300 per head and  had a darshan of the lord in just 2.5 hours.
Tripati temple,The temple is one of the most popular not only in India but throughout world.It was pleasant visit in spite of heavy rush Darshan was well managed and Prasad was good.
Good,"Tirumala is a census town in Chittoor district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The town is a part of Tirupati Urban Development Authority and located in Tirupati mandal of Tirupati revenue division. It is a hill town where Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is located, which is the abode of Lord Venkateswara"
a pious place,"Went early morning for darshan, beautiful drive up the hill, neat & Clean place, prior booking for darshan is a must."
When the lord calls you,"This visit was planned quite a long ago, and am thankful that I along with my family can visit and pay respect to Almighty.The piousness was visible all round the corner and when we saw the other pilgrims, our belief reached many levels up.Hope Lord Vishnu bless us and all the followers who visits the pious place everyday"
Miraculous Temple where Law of grace has prevailed over law of karma,"How and what can a mere mortal write about the effulgence and sheer magnetic and benevolent material power emanated by the presiding deity of this Temple-Balaji-Venkatesa- the infinite lord of the 7 hills.This Temple is a heritage temple for the planet and not only for India or for the people of the Hindu faith.What can I say about the opulence & heritage of this Temple nestled on top of seven hills, the road infrastructure, the IT driven orderly booking systems,the security and orderly management of pilgrim traffic, the all round development of Tirumala ??adjectives fail me.I can only share not one  fbut innumerable cosmic experiences of the majesty and the potent power of the Temple to not only satiate material desires but also of granting spiritual beautitude.Havent experience the kind of material peace & bliss that I experience whenever I get the physical glimpse of the Lord.Just wish it could always be longer for my thirst and desire to be infront of the Lord to partake his profound blessings is insatiable.Have experienced miracles just days after praying in this temple.Also,I urge people to ascend up the hill after darshan to the papanashini..extremely beautiful and enriching experience."
Safety and convenience of devotees in Tirumala Temple,"I have visited Tirumala temple yesterday through APTDC tour package from Chennai.We are 30 people in our Volvo bus and would like to share the experience as below:1)When i came out of temple after dharshan,there was a crowd,which leads to  pull and push to the extent to test your stamina or to show your muscle power.After coming out of the temple,i noticed that Rs 7500 currencies were taken from my Kurtha pocket.2)We were trapped inside room number 34 for about 2 hours from 12.15 to 2.15 PM,where there is no seating arrangements,no water,no toilets,no food available and the room was crowded more than 10-20 times beyond its capacity which leads to accumulations of carbon dioxide which caused vomiting sensation and dizziness for many people. One of the family having 5 members in my tour had left from the room and didn't have darshan."
Venkateshwara Swami temple ( Balaji),"What to write about this world famous temple where daily thousands of devotees pay Darshan , it's on the Tirumala heel , always very big Q , various ways one can pay Darshan , I will not go into detail , as one can open the net and look for various options , but it is one of the most divine experience , which lord Balaji permits, I would like to go through again and again."
Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Travels,"We are planning to visit Shri Tirupati Balaji Darshan from 26th till 28th December 2018. We planned well in advance, still from the middle of Nov-2018 online booking of Rs. 300 Darshan was full till Jan-2019 1st or 2nd week.By google search I found Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Travels, Chennai. I booked on their website Darshan for 10 AM on 28-Dec-2018, I paid money online and then after till date, I am struggling to get my tickets. My calls from Abu Dhabi to Chennai are either not attended or hanged up without a proper response. Even for such a devotional service, they make business in such a poor way that they don't care about customer service at all. By chance, if they pick the call they ask every time some new query and I full fill that immediately, still, we are now helpless to get the ticket for darshan.I usually don't post negative reviews, but I request the Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Travels owner that for devotional services please don't act this way. We human, be service oriented. Your business is for God's service if you will act this way and we remain without Darshan then for sure God will not forgive you and your business."
Terrible crowd management,This is one of the richest temples in the world. You would expect better crowd management. It seems the temple management is artificially creating chaos and frenzy by not allowing people into the temple on a continuous basis. Seems like a scam to create difficulty for devotees who come to get a view of Lord Vekateshwara. You will end up waiting 7-8 hours for a 2 second view of the lord's statue. Very bad crowd management with no consideration for senior/disabled/children/sick people.
Devotional,It is beautiful &cool place.god place on earth.excellent facilities by ttd for preligrimis.but don't eat food in tirumala in private hotels
Grand Temple on Hilltop.,"Tirumala temple is also known as ""Temple of Lord Venkateshwra''.it is also known as 'Tirupati ke balaji'.We took ticket of Rs.300/- for 'Special Entry Darshan'.It took around three  hours to reach the main temple and to have darshan of Lord Venkatshwra.At the main gate of temple ,general line and  ''special entry darshan line'' are mixed and only one line is made to have darshan. We had very good darshan of Lord Venkateshwra.After darshan we sat for a while in the temple and made our offerings to the god in the hundy."
"Worst quality buses, please dont use APTDC Tour packages.","Worst quality buses, please dont use APTDC Tour packages. I want to bring to your notice that I have faced severe breathing problem yesterday night while boarded the below bus/trip to Tripati at 11 PMi. At 12AM, I forcibly asked the driver to stop the vehicle to get down because I was feeling suffocation due to bad air / AC quality or no oxygen.When I boarded the bus it was so suffocating and after 15 mins I was not able to breathe and started sweating completely.I reported the next seat passenger that he is also having the issue and they told its bad quality of AC and they were masked their face by towel/handkerchief when he boarded the bus. Then immediately I came to the driver desk and reported the issue, They said they will decrease the AC temperature but still I told I am not comfortable and asked them to open the windows if possible. They denied that there is no option to open the windows. Finally due to suffocation and no oxygen inside the bus, I told them to drop the nearby bus stop so I can return to Bangalore. The driver stopped at Hoskote and I returned back home. I want to request your team to please check the AC condition and Air quality where more oxygen should be present inside the bus,  If I could been adjusted then I am sure if I would have survived. I felt its narrow escape from APTDC.I have traveled in A/C Sleeper/Coach and this is the first time am experiencing this issue only with APTDC.Please ensure the quality of the bus is properly examined before you start any trip. The outside of AC Coach is looking good and internal qualities are really bad."
a very good darshan of Lord venkateswara,We waited in the q for about 5 hours but it was worth the wait to have a darshan of Lord Venkateswara.  Indeed blessed to have a nice darshan.
TTD BEST MANAGEMENT,At most worshiped and crowded  god in india need to visit the temple of venkateswara swamy(BALAJI). The maintainance  of the tirumala by ttd was well maintained . Time slot for dharshan which will be available online and ttd kalyanamandapam .
Namo Venaktesaya,"Recently I visited Tirumala. As usual it is maintaining neat and clean roads. Hats off. All you can get free like free bus, free food, free haircut, free Darshan, free accommodation, free prasadam. Its awesome to provide to such a large number of people coming every day. But only thing I observed Q lines are changing every time I visited, it's very difficult to find it. They can shortcut the Q when not busy. Its easy to tell this and  hard to do but with some effort they can do. TTD has done many things like this. Govinda...."
Govinda Govinda,"At the insistence of wife had to travel to the temple, despite being fully aware of the rush. My experiencesBeen to many renouned temples, but poor organisation of this one takes the cake.Mismanagement starts from the entry point at the start of the journey from mountain base, everything will be thoroughly checked and your luggage has to be scanned. Long queues there and for tokens for toll will need at least 30 minutes before you even start you up journey of 1 hour. So for 10 am durshan you have to be at the toll at 8 am at max. Finding the VIP durshan entry is another exercise, with poor markings for directions. Where the vehicle drops you it is at least one km walk to the entry point with no cover.1. Take your chappals as much inside as you can, don't leave it in the car, even for VIP durshan, as the walk is long and without cover. Take an umbrella too apart from water, as it rained and there is no cover till the time you reach the entrance.They will not allow you to take chappal and umbrella inside, so need to deposit at the entrance. But there is place to deposit at the entrance! Place to deposit is at least 500 metres away, and for luggage is 1 km away! Excellent. Enjoy the walk.2. There would be at least 4 double lines, with bottlenecks reducing it to a single line and check points everywhere, so your movement is slow and painful at best. 3. Lines of all types of durshan merge so be prepared for jostling like Mumbai locals, if you have ever been in one. If it rains, then you can be prepared to have slippery floors as water enters everywhere and you have to be very careful.4. After at least one to two hours of standing in line (if you are lucky), you reach the deity, which you can view for two to three seconds at best from at least 50 feet away as inner sanctum is reserved only for VVIP. And you are pushed out by the sevadars.5. Then you stand in lines to get Prasad, (not the laddos, which can be taken later at a different venue, but what seemed like tamarind rice). The area after that is a huge mess, with absolutely zero cleanliness as people will drop Prasad. Rains made it worse. In the ten minutes of my stay there to eat Prasad, I could not see a single cleaning process, surprising considering the mess being created there.6. Then you reach another area to get laddos, where you have to buy plastic covers first as it is not free, costs RS 3 per bag, then stand in another line to get your laddos that you booked. Surprising to see a weighing machine at each counter so that you can check the weight of the Prasad. Why? People don't trust them for Prasad? 7. Getting out and trying to find your vehicle is another exercise when no clear direction and no one seems to know the way or the direction.Please don't take this otherwise, I am just sharing my experience, hopefully which would help you prepare for the arduous journey ahead."
Divinity at the abode of the God,"Every time I visit the temple, I am overwhelmed with the way the management and handling of close to 60,000-70,000 devotees are handled.Here are a few unique practices the temple follows:1. Unlike other temples, where devotees carry pooja plate and offer flowers/ coconuts etc, in this temple that is not allowed.2. There is very highs security in and around the temple. So mobiles need to be surrendered and bags are scanned. So please be light about your baggage.3. There will be people who will push you due to the immense crowds that are handled everyday. Please do stay CALM and think of Govinda4. Enjoy the yummy prasad that is distributed after the darshan.5. As you take a pradakshinam ( walking around the diety), do look up and enjoy the gold carvings on the Gopuram6.There is a separate Hundi  which is kept outside the main sanctum. No other place is kept for donations.7. The glorious ladoo is made in pure ghee and is richly filled with kajus etc. Do make it a point to take the ladoos for yourself and your near and dear ones.There is so much more to say about the practices in the temple that I shall pen it down as and when I do rememberGovinda Govinda Govinda"
Divine one,The Holy Temple needs no mention here as its one of the most pious places on this planet. Special mention is the Seva Tickets that one needs to buy online which makes the Darshan easy.
Horrible Planning by TTD,"Avoid going for divya darshan as they do not give a damn about the common man here. We were told at Alipiri that there is no rush and the darshan can be completed in 2 hours only to stand in line for 7 hours. They huddled the folks into these closed rooms (they call them compartments) where we were made to sit and wait for hours with no information or communication. All because some VIP idiot visited the temple, the authorities have to lick these VIP shoes so they stop everyone else until these fellows fulfill their darshan. Go if you must but try getting some VIP to get you in..The TTD folks will not care for you if you are in the Divya Darshan or Sarva Darshan Lines so avoid those as much as possible"
Always a divine experience!,"Despite the challenge of long queues and the waiting times, it's always nice to be there. Went from Chennai in the Special Darshan category of INR 300 per head. Taking a tour package helps to do it all in a day."
Vasanthotsava Seva @ tirumala,"I have booked Seva through ttdsevaonline 2 months before for 26th Nov 2PM slot. since accommodation is not available for that date, have booked pai viceroy hotel at tirupathi. Seva will be conducted at vaibhotsava mandapam exactly opposite to Main entrance next to temple car. we have to take online confirmation receipt and id proofs submitted during booking to get into the mandapam. Ursava deity will be brought to the mandapam in a palanquin/litter and abhisegams will be performed. Arnd 3.35pm, final haarathi is shown and allowed to have close look at Ursava deity in Queue where sataari/shadari is placed on heads and insisted to leave the mandapam. After leaving mandapam, you have to walk to supatham entrance( have to take stairs to the left of main entrance, south mada street). it will take you to VKC-Q1 where in the middle of the way, seva booking receipts are scanned for bar codes and sealed ""checked"" to confirm your entry. 2 laddu's will be given only if these seals are there (entries are confirmed), laddu counter in north west corner of temple. 1.30 hrs we finished a nice darshan and back."
Near god experience. Best managed Temple in India,Tirumala is the best managed temple trust in India. Lakhs of devotees arrive here daily. The place is clean and well maintained with free food and lodging services. The Balaji temple of course is the most beautiful thing there. It has lot of places to visit as well.
Wonderful experience,All the pilgrims are well taken care of by the TTD management. I didn't any problems which l heard from others regarding long waiting in the queue.
Truly Blessed,It was my first visit to the most popular and the richest temple in the world. The vehicles are allowed right upto the base. In all humility I thought of seeking blessings by doing some penance. It was a three hour long queue before we could set our eyes on the holy deity. But it was worth the trouble.
Holy trip,Very divine. Very easy to get tokens for darshan. Darshan in normal tokens take 5 hrs. Not much of a hassle.
Govinda Govinda all the way,"Do's	• Most of the dos and donts are mentioned clearly in the below mentioned website and bookings may also be made on it :ttdconline.comttdsevaonline.com	• Plan your trip for three days(if coming from a far off city like Delhi, Mumbai etc. ) and make sure you make your booking for darshan and accommodation on this official website of TTDC:	• Carry a pair of light woollen clothes as it may get cold at night and early morning	• Plan your trip according to the availability of above two and NOT as per your CONVENIENCE.	• If you don't get accommodation here, book a hotel room in Tirupati instead of the TTDC area.	• It's about one hour drive, at max, and a beautiful experience. 	CONS:	Inspite of the holiness, sanctity and attachment associated with the shrine, there are many loopholes in even the online booking as well as the Darshan system as it is the approach of high shot politicians, beaureaucrats and influential people and your links only that works here the best.	• It is a hard truth that If you want a room and willing to pay the requisite charges, you'll get it, if and only if, you have any recommendation letter.	• VVIP Darshan booking is not at all available online. May I ask how do we get the same?	• There's no possibility to get Darshan from the least distant if you are not in VVIP Quota.	• Even though I have been to many pilgrimages and temples but ultimately the Holy Darshan is the same for all the pilgrims and yatris. But here in Tirupati ji, Darshan is different for common man and VVIPs.	• This is kind of unacceptable!	• A system should be devised wherein all the bhakts/devotees should be entitled to equal opportunities to Darshan of the Lord Tirupati, irrespective of their power, position and status, even if it means to stand in the queue for longer than usual. These are my personal views and not meant to offend anyone in any case."
My visit Balaji temple in Tirumala.,"Last week 10th Nov. we visited Tirumala temple with Trichy RPN travels by bus. We reach Tirumala at 4.45 am. They arranged a hotel for take bath and refresh, after break fast we travel to Tirumala by AP state bus. The tour company already purchase the special dharisan tickets. Directly drop on Vaigundam gate no1. Little crowd was there but moved fast, We got Very good Lord Balaji dharisanam. Govinda Goovinda. We got very nice prasatham and purchase some Pooja items. After lunch we visited Sri kalakasthi Siva temple and visited Padmavathi Thayar.On the way we had our dinner and reach home at 4.40 am in Trichy. Really nice bus,responsible drivers and knowledgeable guide. Every thing was good. Thanks RPN travels Trichy."
blissfull visit,"Visited the temple with family. My parents were senior citizens and as such had to take token early morning. However when they reached the place to wait, it was a real surprise. The temple authorities really took care of my parents (and all other elders in general), gave food, water etc and when it was time to to Darshan stopped all other queues. Within about 15 mts they were able to a peaceful Darshan of the deity. Eventhough we went separately we didnt wait long for the darshan. Overall good experience"
Need no words to review,This is a world famous temple that is very powerful. You will need to wait for 4-6 hours atleast to get a 10 second glimpse of the god.
Spiritual visit to Tirumala,"We visited the place in IRCTC 2 day package from Hyderabad. Though the trip was hectic, the hospitality of the guide and hotel staff was good. We completed the Darshan within 2 hrs of time. Overall it was a nice trip to the seven hills"
Om Namo Venkateshaaya,We don't have the right to review the almighty's divine place. Just want to say Wowww and mesmerizing. Om Namo Venkateshaaya.
"Govinda, Govinda, all the way!","Do not forget to book your Darshana Timings in advance after logging on to the TTD website, otherwise, be ready for serpentine queues. Be at the premise atleast 30 minutes before the timings and pay attention once you enter the sanctum. A short glance at the Lord Almighty after a long wait, but worth it. Do not miss the tradition of snan in the pond first, then visit to the Varaha Swami Temple and after that to the main Tirumala Tirupati Temple... Also many other attractions in and around the Tirumala Hills. Excellent service by the Transport Department right from the Tirupati Airport upto the Tirumala Hill top bus stand. Do follow the security drill and do not try to be smart by circumventing any rules. Maintain the sanctity of the Holy Hills."
"""Paradise of Lord""",Excellent place... If u want to visit a devotional place in INDIA... Tirupati (Tiru Mala) is the best and excellent place.... If u just visit then u feel very comfortable and devotional feelings definitely..
All the time I love to go once a year !!,"This is my favorite place, I went on 7th Nov evening to tirumala, I have already booked room with 500Rs, so no need to wait for room, jest in sec you will get room allotment, once we get it go to the room and took rest after dinner in Balaji bhavan where the hotel was in the same guesthouse which is lovely to stay there. Very nice room with two Bed and hot water with both indian and western toilet.   8th Nov morning we started at 8am to visit darshan with 300Rs ticket, it took around 45 minutes to see lard Venki, no crowed due to diwali so very nice and smooth queue flow. After that we got laddu, we can get how much we want now a day, i mean if you need more laddu then you can get it. So plan your trip on Wednesday so that you will get good and nice exp."
Namo Venkateshwara !,"The Temple is its self Vaikuntham for all Hindus. I do visit almost every year. It's over crowded but once you have darshan of Lord Venkateshwara you will forget every struggle that you did for take darshan. Everything is organised, from q to darshan. Annaprasadam. Temple commenter kept everything organised from accomodation till prasadam. A great pilgrimage tour. Namo Venkateshwara."
For religious persons a great pleasure,We are moved by the devotees to Lord Balaji and even those who are not particularly devoted to Him tend to get moved by the crowd of devotees.
Nice visit...,I visited Tirupati balaji temple on 14 the of Oct.. it was a rush due to bramotsav.. i have a kid also.. so little bit problem.. the most embarrassing moment with me is that two pair costly shoes from my family was stolen from the shoes stand in the presence of police on duty.. when i told them about the matter..they didn't respond.. till i didn't understand that what the police on duty do near shoes stand.. there was no much rush on there as well as no security..  lastly i came to know from my father that when we keep our shoes..one police on duty laugh... My papa noticed the matter.. when we come to collect after 2 hr..the police was not there..i am pretty much sure that police on duty  was the culprit.. Overall experience was superb.. so if any one have to go for darahan.. kindly keep your shoes at room... When i went to Tirupati.. in a small town like tirupati there is at least 70 shoes store... He he he he ...Govinda...gooovinda
It's a good temple for the one who can wait for days and days.,"It's no good management who can take care of visitors. It's a very awful journey if u came through Allipiri way(walking way). We aren't treated like humans right there, they notice us like who don't receive respect."
Always beautiful ... ,"Amazing place, people and experiences every time I visit this temple. Has its own vibes which are difficult to put into words but am sure worth a visit.Bought the Rs. 300 ticket and the darshan was over within 2.5 hours. So if you have less time, then VIP lane is best bet. I suggest try weekdays and you may get the darshan done within less than 2.5 hours."
Very beautiful temple and place,Tirumula temple is the most famous temple all over India of Lord Srinivas...  The temple is crowded with many people from all over India. There are free lunch services to the visitors to the temple...  The place is very beautiful. But inside the temple because of crowd we feel some uncomfortable. Rather than that that the place is awesome...
Trip to Tirupathi,"We have started at 7 am from Chennai.Reached tiruttani at 10 am after completing breakfast en route. Car can go to the top of the hill, so we reached near the temple. Being sunday, rush was there in free darshan; so we took Rs 100/- ticket & entered. Darshan completed within 30 minutes. Started to tirupathi at 11 am from Tiruttani.Reached Tirupathi at 12.30 pm. Stayed at Hotel Govind heights,Tirupathi.Visited Sri Padmavathi amman temple in evening 5 pm.My special darshan timing is 11 am on Monday. So on monday 7.15 am, checked out the hotel and started to tirumala. At hill entry, we have to remove & scan all the luggages in our car. Car will be fully checked by the securities. Entry ticket is Rs 15/- for up&down. Reached tirumala in 40 minutes from entry toll. There is the ""KALYANA KATTA"" in the hill entrance for MOTTAI/TONSURE. Its free.

Nice and quick darshan,We took the special entry darshan ticket of 11 AM slot. We joined the queue at 11 am & finished darshan withing next 2 hours. Its a divine experience
Excellent ,No ward to say a highly maintain temple everyday thousand of people came here but the still keep so clean n disciple   Prasad  is also great
Its all about Faith!!,"When you visit Tirumala for Lord Balaji's blessings you must be prepared to spend 2-3 hours in the process of darshan. While there are options to stay the night, there are more options in Tirupati. Electronics, cameras are not permitted so please secure them in a safe place before visiting the shrine. Recommended to carry drinking water. It can get difficult for infants. Please prepare accordingly. Dress code is strictly enforced. Only India wear, it is also defined on the rear of the ticket. The Tirupati ladoos are my all time favourite. It is good to plan in advance and book the Rs 300/- special darshan ticket including paying for the ladoos."
SATISFYING VISIT TO BALAJI TEMPLE,"We had a darshan after attending Kalyanotsavam.  This temple being one of the most famous in India is crowded throughout the year.  However, it is well maintained and Darshan is well managed with online booking and systematic queue system.  A glimpse of the lord is more than sufficient to any devotee.While the entire process of booking and Darshan is very smooth, the authorities should plan something to move the crowd out of the temple with ease.  Free Prasadam counter just outside the temple create lot of rush."
Must Visit This Holy Temple At Least Once in Lifetime,"This Temple (Temple of Seven Hills) is dedicated to Lord Sri Venkateswara, an incarnation of Vishnu. It is the richest temple in the world in terms of donations  received and wealth (collection of around Rs.1000 crores in Hundis every year). The temple is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily. Hence, online booking for Special Darshan is highly recommended. Booked Special Darshan ticket online (Rs.300 per person- 2 Laddus as Prasad given free). Visited after 44 years. Took 1 hour for Darshan. Strict dress code. For Men- dhoti & full or half shirt-white or any colour or kurta/full or half shirt & pyjama. For Women- Saree or half Saree & blouse or churidar with pyjama and dupatta. Purses, wallets, small bags (preferably plastic or cloth) containing food & water is allowed. No electronic gadgets or mobile phone are allowed inside temple.Temple premises and roads outside are very clean. This Balaji or Venkateswara temple is one of the best mainatined temples anywhere in India. Free shuttle buses are available to go to car parking areas or anywhere outside temple area. Toilet facilities are available when you are waiting in Q for Special Darshan."
Felt like entering a fortress with iron grills all around!!,The crowd is over whelming...the darshan took exactly an hour in the line.. couldn't see much of the gardens as it is cordoned for general public.. had the basic and simple meal at anna prasadam centre..seating on the floor...very different experience from the last time i visited the temple 20yrs ago..left longing though...
Devine temple,Fully devotional.must follow ethics at temple. Darshan took two hours. Advise online booking for darshan.felt peaceful and blessed.Very powerful God and must visit temple.  Wonderful temple with huge campus.
Must visit during Bramhotsav,I have been visiting Balaji Temple for quite sometime but this time went in September during Bramhotsav. It was amazing. Excellent ambient. Must visit during Bramhotsav. Children will enjoy but of course everything must be pre-booked from accommodation to Darshan.
A Divine temple in a serene environment!!,"There have been countless visits to this temple as I can recall from my childhood and yet each experience is different and refreshing. One always feels welcomed at this abode of god. It is a very well maintained, small town at the top of the hill, with people working, dedicated to make visitors journey pleasant and comfortable. Everyday thousands and sometimes lakhs of visitors, with hopes, wishes, prayers come to have a 5-10 second darshana of the god from across the world. Its a must visit to witness this immense faith with which people visit the temple.Tiru means title given to men (addressing as tiru with name followed) and mala means hill as it is on top of a hill.For first time visitors tickets are available online, and also after reaching tirumala based on the crowd. There is also a free darshana available.But if you havent visited this place at all, and you happen to be in Andhra pradesh, please do not skip this."
Great Experience,"Very well maintained & clean devastanam. The journey from the base to the temple was refreshing & rejuvenating. It's tempting to take the trip on walk, but needs a fair amount of time & resolve. With the Lord's blessings & special pass could have a great darshan. It's a great feeling as it's being told that it's all as per the Lord's will since hundreds of thousands of devotees seek darshan of the Lord daily."
"Heaven on Earth, to put simply","Visit here, if you'd like to get a darshan of the Lord himself in all his glory. Make sure you book darshan tickets well in advance to prevent last minute rush and hours of waiting in queues. The Rs 300 Special Ticket is the most recommended one. There's some great accommodation in downhill Tirupati, so it'd be best to camp there."
Holy place well managed,I do not recollect the number of times I have visited the temple. And every year feel like going to Tirumala.Really feel blessed every time we visit.Had darshan within an hour this time. Thanks to online booking system.
A Holy Journey for every Hindu,"Macca for Muslims as well as Tirumala for Hindus. It is a divine place of Lord Balaji (Sri Venkateswara Swamy). At least 50 thousand pilgrims visit every day. If you want reach Tirumala first you need to reach Tirupati. Tirupati is well connected by Road, Rail and by Air from across all destinations, from there you can reach Tirumala by Walk or Road. You can take a bus or taxi for road. If you plan well advanced you can get a Darshan (Visiting Lord Balaji) ticket and a room by online otherwise you have to be in long que at triumala."
Devine Blessing,It has been a wonderful experience and feeling whenever I visit.It is crowded throughout the year. During school exams may be the best time to visit for less crowd.
Pilgrimage.. ,"Divine place of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy, also called by his devotees with sheer devotion as Sri Balaji, Venkkanna Swamy and with so many distinct names. Lord Balaji, has his presence that can be felt across seven hills, along with a mystic aura. This pilgrimage bestowed by grace of lord as best historic and spiritual world.Devotees have darshan of Lord Balaji, streamlined and organized perfectly by TTD management. Types of darshan are many, like Divya Darshan, Seeghra Darshan, sarva Darshanam etc. Special Sevas are available.For types of darshan and sevas booking may be had through their respective official website and App."
Holy Journey Towards Tirumala Temple in Tirupathi,"This was our second visit after 4 years and things have changed for better for the worshipers  with lot of easy way of traveling including the main roads, signage to find out the entrance etc. Place was kept clean and tidy for the people to have  ahealthy time as well."
First visit to Tirumala,"We starred journey from Mumbai to Chennai by flight (Go Air), Chennai to Tirupati by train. Now Chennai airport & central railway station is connected by Metro so it is hassle free transfer. From Tirupati, state government transport buses are continually ferry people to Tirumala. We have online 300 rupee Darshan pass & we are lycky that we had darshan in 1 hour. We also witnessed Bramhostavam & to our surprise there are very few people. We feel the vibrations when we saw the chariot. After Tirupati we complete our journey visiting Kolhapur. It is nice trip with quiet darshan of Lord Balaji."
Blissful visit,"Best temple in India/World, despite heavy footfall temple and 7 hills are maintained very well. You should be prepared to spend at least 3-4 time in the queue for darshan. Do not hesitate to ask for assistance from volunteers as they are very helpful"
