Russian Robson St. (but better),"We spent several hours walking up and down Red St. (Krasnaya) both on the weekend and during the week. It’s great no matter when you go if you’re looking for cafes, restaurants, boutiques, entertainment.Weekends are probably better as the main part of Krasnaya (about a mile) in the business section is completely closed off to vehicular traffic.There are cafes and restaurants to every taste and a farmer’s market sets up with a wide variety of crafts and foods.In addition there is a lot of interesting architecture and there are several fountains and statue worth seeing. On top of all this there are a couple of really peaceful parks where you can just chill out from the crowd.At night the street is lit up with Christmassy over the street lighting and there always seems to be music playing, recorded and live.A wonderful walk for the whole family."
Good walk,"On Sunny, not so hot, days; the walking along the middle island of the street is a great activity to do. With shading trees on the left and right and a lot of people around. The only negative thing is that at some part, near McDonald’s there were bikers blocking the walkway by their bikes standing and chatting. Otherwise, there is enough space for walking, roller skating, cycling. It is really enjoyable"

Boring street,"there is nothing beautiful in it. A lot of people, cars, shops.In the evenings  Lights turn up.colorful!"
Very Positive ,"Weekends this street closing the traffic and all people are on this street. You can find mini concert performances , street musicians, dancers, animal lovers and lots of kind of animals. The street seems like a carnival. When you are in, you can feel so happy here."
Fabulous stay,"This was our first ever visit to Russia.  What a glorious surprise it was.  Red Street was wonderful for the gardens, the fountains, the sculptures and just to walk. Very clean, no litter, no grafitti and we felt totally safe."
No one believes me,"The best part of this street is most of the main street closes during the weekend and holidays and you are able to walk on the street. No one so far believes me that the main street closes!The street has a lot of statues, cafes, bars, restaurants and shops.The northern part is know fro the flowers and the southern part for the shops and cafes.I would recommend to walk in this street on a weekend and you would have an amazing experience."
the main street in Krasnodar,"It is the oldest street of Krasnodar full of nice shops, cafes and restaurants, half of the street is a boulevard with beautiful trees"

Main street of Krasnodar,"It's difficult not to give 5 stars to the whole street. Most of the attraction of the city are located if not on this street, then in the very close vicinity of it. Nice to stroll through in the evening - the lights, music playing, people watching. Lovely"
Great to walk around there car-free on weekends!,"Shops and ""Galerya Krasnodar"" shopping mall from 10 to 21 hours everyday. Delicious sandwiches at ""bread history"" (chleb istorii), souvenir shops, parks, cathedral, monuments, very convenient to walk around."
Nice for a stroll,"The wide sidewalks - punctuated by parks and statues - offers such a nice opportunity to get out of your room and stroll.  Weekends are especially nice as the street is closed to vehicular traffic - all the locals are out enjoying the good weather (which is pretty often).  At night it is lit up and beautiful - and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.  Street sweepers are out regularly - tidying up."
Krasnodar's main street,"If you want to see most of the important tourist sights of Krasnodar, simple walk the length of Krasnaya Street."
nice place to have a walk downtown the krasnodar city,nice place to walk ... no car around and ... shops and other attraction are in this area ... in the beginning (est side) one of the best church to visit ...
"Clean and green, beautiful and romantic",A short walk from Krasnodar gallery or galleria. The place has beautiful buildings on the side and its awesome place.
Beatiful avenue,"Krasnaya Street runs through the centre of Krasnodar.The night views of lit up buildings, The Aurora theatre and fountain show are spectacular. The walk from the Aurora to the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral takes about three hours with many interesting and unusual buildings and monuments to see. There are numerous cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. The street is extremely cultured and safe. Try and visit the Kuban Cossack Theatre-there was a school choir performing during a Russian Orthodox event when I visited. Extremely touching. Well done to the people of Krasnodar for designing such a terrific thoroughfare."
walking is amazing,Walking through Krasnai street is relaxible  and affected with sculptures. Especially night time is so nice watching water show with music. I like it.
