An incredible spiritual experience!,"It took us multiple attempts to get to Tian Tan Buddha due to the strict cable car schedule but what an experience it was. Soak up the temples, statues, and gorgeous nature, and then take the bus to Tai O village for dinner."
Big Buddha,It is a great experience once. A must see.Go in the winter as the walking will be tough for older people. There are a lot of tourists so do not expect this to be a peaceful retreat with the family.
Very impressive!,"The Tian Tan Buddha or the Big Buddha is a large 34 metres bronze statue of Buddha Shakyamuni.  It was completed in 1993. A very impressive statue of Buddha indeed, also from different angles!. (In my previous review of the Po Lin Monastery, the spelling of the late Hong Kong entertainter should be Anita Mui).üôè"
"Down, not up unless you're fitter than me","The best way, in my opinion (and I'm old and fat) is to take the bus up and then walk underneath the cable car down to Tung Chung. It's an excellent trail which is pretty challenging going up but pretty easy going down."
nice experience!,You need to take a cable car ride to this and the entire trip is worth a few hours. You can find good deals on Klook.com for the cable car. Visiting the statue is free. There is a monastery nearby where you get Chinese vegetarian food as well
Big Buddha-A peaceful haven,"The Statue of the 112 feet tall Big Buddha, constructed from 202 bronze pieces and 34 metres tall is a must visit when you visit Ngong Ping. It is visited through the year by a large number of tourists. Very peaceful and worth spending some time.  The Buddha statue denotes the harmonious relationship between people and faith, set amidst the lap of nature.  A total of 268 steps lead to Buddha. However, there is also a small road for vehicles etc. so that any one with a physical disability is also able to visit. Beneath the statue are three halls and there is a relic of Buddha inside which can be seen only by visitors who purchase an offering for the Buddha.Worth a visit totally!"
Amazing,"The weather was very hot,  and the sun was so big.  But it is worth when you finish the stair and saw the Buddha. A super sizes Buddha that I have never seen  and the inside area will have air conditioner,  you can take a rest after finishing the stair."
windy,it is very impressive. the Big Buddha statue to me is the icon of Hong Kong. please come here. very recommended
Nice Holidays walking excerise,It‚Äôs a good place for a nice morning excerise   up the 277 steps. Especially during weekdays when there are few visitors getting into your viewfinder of your camera. From Tung Chung you can either take the Cable car (Expansive option) where you can enjoy a great view from above or you can go the the bus station and take the Air-con bus No.23
Amazing Buddha! Must See,This is one of the fantastic attractions of Hong Kong. You need to take a cable car ride to this and the entire trip is worth a few hours. You can find good deals on Klook.com for the cable car. Visiting the statue is free. There is a monastery nearby where you get Chinese vegetarian food as well
Amazing,This was an incredible sight. It's a must see when visiting Hong Kong. Make sure to bring comfortable shoes or sneakers for the almost 300 steps to get to the top.
Worthwhile Hike with Hidden Gem !!,"Since the COV19 pandemic started. Being far away from the city, like hiking, cycling and adventurous things have been so popular. Me, my brother and my cousin decided to hike Lantau peak coz we just finished our quarantine (14 days at home ) back from the UK.We took a bus from Tung Chung. Only bus no. 23 were operating every 30-40 mins. And we got off in Pak Kung Au and we hiked to Lantau Peak (which is the second highest peak in HK after Tai Mo Shan). It was such fine weather, the sky looked so close. It was like hill after hill and my cousin literally gave up cuz he hiked after such a long time. We finally reached the top which was 934m elevation from the sea level.. It was lovely weather with a cool breeze. We decided to sit for a while and have some snacks that we bought. And after a while we decided to go to Big Buddha, the board showing us NGONG PING. It was like a hidden gem hike with some resting areas and a wisdom path was very beautifully decorated. Very peaceful, very positive vibes. And finally we reached Tian Tan Buddha for the 3rd time after 4 years. It was a beautiful and worthwhile hike. Since it was closed due to the epidemic, we couldn't go upstairs inside the belly of Big Buddha. That's what it called* ? We prayed and visited the small temples nearby which were opened. We rested and took some pictures. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in a very good location. Never make you feel down !!!Better to hike and go. It's seriously so damn beautiful. You can see the other path of the hidden gem there. Def. going back again!! Always feels like when I go back to HK.Cheersss !!"
"Peace and Quiet, when you need it","After many years of absence from Hong Kong, I was taken aback by the ferocity of the protests at the time. To be able to turn off the news for an afternoon, I decided to go to visit the Big Buddha in Lantau Island. Instead of taking the cable car, I took the ferry to Mui Wo, from the Central Ferry Pier, and then a bus to the monastery and village. The ferry ride took about 45 minutes, which was perfect for a short afternoon nap. The bus stop is just across from the ferry terminal. The ride up to the Big Buddha area is still as thrilling as before, with quick turns in narrow roads, at a pretty good clip. The bus was not busy - I was only one of three passengers onboard, and the only one going to the Big Buddha area. It is now more popular to take the Ngong Ping 360 cable care to access the area.The arrival of the Ngong Ping 360 cable car has transformed the area near the Big Buddha. It is more commercialized now, almost like the Peak area in Hong Kong Island. It is quite convenient and kid-friendly in the Ngong Ping village, with souvenir shops, 7-Eleven stores, theaters and restaurants.But outside of the shopping village, things are much like a couple of decades ago - with cows and other animals roaming freely, along with the visitors. After a long climb up the stairs, you are quickly rewarded with an expansive view of the island. Surrounded by green mountains, the ocean and the sky, you get some time to forget the disturbances of the day, and feel at peace. The Big Buddha, after all, has your back!"
Amazing Trip!,"It's my second time visiting Tian Tan Buddha in 15 years, extremely impressed with the cable car.It's highly recommended to get there early about 9 am (about 15 mins getting the ticket) unless buying in advance. Otherwise, you might have to wait at least an hour if you're there after 11 am. Also, highly suggested to board a crystal (glass-bottomed) cabin on the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car to Ngong Ping village (25 mins ride). Walking up to the big Buddha and pray.  We got a private cabin on the way back. Then, can do a (window) shopping at the Citygate Outlets"
Extremely Large Buddha,"This 100 ft tall bronze Buddha is considered the largest seated Buddha in the world. There are a lot of steps to get up to it and there is a restaurant inside - buy tickets at the base prior to climbing the steps. From the top there is a good view of the lush green surrounding mountains. Next door is a pretty Buddhist temple you can look into which is quite ornate. There are nearby shops, restaurants and bathrooms if needed. We took the bus up to the Buddha which takes longer than the cable car but is a picturesque ride."
Worthwhile Trip,"This is a good destination to visit for the whole day which also include Lamma Island's fish village. There is also good vegetarian food available at the temple. Apart from visiting this beautiful temple, the fishing village can also be a good place to visit for the evening which brings one back to the age of 60s and 70s. The seafood is very good and walking around the village can be a worthwhile trip."
Gem,"Accessible by MTR you will need to then take a bus for about another 30 minutes, or you can do a taxi for about $20USD each direction.  The taxi is worth it as there are some beautiful beaches along the way that you may want to stop at..."
Magical and Majestic,"Wonderful experience taking the gondola up to Tian Tan Buddha, take the gondola with the glass floor, it's wild! Ensure to go on a day that is clear and it is not raining. Make sure to wear good walking shoes and be prepared to walk up a big staircase to get to Tian Tan Buddha. It's simply gorgeous and there's a lot more to explore while you are there. Here's a great tip: GO EARLY - the earlier you go the fewer people."
Go there on a sunny day. I didn't...!,"It's amazing. Love to see things like that in foreign countries. To see how people who are more religious than me show their respect. Huge area with a lot of exhibitions here and there. Go there on a sunny day to get a good view of it. Pretty misty when I was there. Cable car was not working, but bus 23 from Tung Chung did it. Make sure you're in shape to make the 236 steps to the top. Btw. the live cattle out there is funny. Didn't know they had that in Hong Kong"
"Yeah, its pretty boring but you still need to go see it","Despite the cable cars were not in operation due to COVID-19, getting to Big Buddha is easy via the bus charter from Tung Chung Station.The virus has had a huge impact on visitors.  There is very little tourist and mostly locals that are visiting.  While the Buddha is big, photo opportunity especially near the bottom of the stairs.  Photos are PROHIBITED inside the Buddha.It is pretty boring but still a must see."
Disney-fied...,"The Big Buddha itself is fantastic and well worth visiting. But the area around it had a Disneyfied air about it, and the cable car that leads to it often has looooooong lines. I strongly suggest going off-season."
Terrifc Cable Car Ride with scenic views,Stay at the nearby Novotel for convenient access to the shopping mall and the entrance to th cable car. Enjoy!  Fr. Bruce+
Amazing attraction in Hong Kong,We really enjoyed to visit the Big Buddha. We took the Ngong Ping 360 cable car to go up to the Big Buddha. The view is beautiful.
Worth The Bus Ride!,"The Ngong Ping 360 cable cars were not running because of the novel coronavirus hysteria, so we took a First Ferry out of Central pier 6 to Lantau Island, Mui Wo Village. From there a bus will drive 40 minutes to the Big Buddha. I preferred the tour of the island by bus over using the 360 cable car, and I was able to use my Octopus card for the Ferry and the bus."
Landmark attraction on Lantau Island,"The Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha) is a major tourist attraction and landmark on Lantau Island, near the village of Tung Chung. After nearly 12 years of construction, the Big Buddha opened to the public in 1993. It is a 34-metre tall bronze figure of Buddha seated in a lotus position. Entry is free and opening hours are 10am to 5.30pm daily. The Big Buddha is situated between the Ngong Ping Village and Po Lin Monastery. There is a long set of 268 steps that you must climb to arrive at the base of the statue. At the base, You will also see six more bronze statues. These are the Six Devas, each facing and making offering to the Buddha. On clear days, views of the surrounding area from the hillside base are really nice as well. You will also have very good close photo opportunities of the Big Buddha. Afterwards, you can visit the museum situated within the multiple storey podium that holds the landmark statue. The museum (HK$30 inc. bottle of water and ice-cream snack) includes exhibition halls, Buddha relic (crystals) and a large bell which is rung periodically throughout the day. You will also find artworks and other information regarding the concept, design and construction of the Tian Tan Buddha statue. Note: If you want to climb up to the Big Buddha and see it up close, allow 15-20 minutes to do so. Add another 15-20 minutes if you are plan to visit the museum there as well. Note: Most visit the Big Buddha along with Po Lin Monastery by way of the Nong Ping 360 cable car ride from the Tung Chung Lower Terminus to the Upper Terminus on the other side of the Ngong Ping Village, 5-6 minute walk to the Big Buddha. You can alternatively take taxi from the airport or Tung Chung as well as bus transportation to/from Tung Chung (route 23), Tai O (route 21) or Mui Wo (route 2)."
Amazing,Highly recommend a visit here the Buddha is amazing and the little town is lovely with nice restaurants and shops.
Take the walk!,"Nice day tour when there are riots in the city. Take a bus or the cable car up, enjoy a relaxing hour, and then take the walk down. Plan on spending about 3-4 hours on this very well maintained trail. If you are in good shape, take the walk up!"
Amazing Spot,We really enjoyed viewing this Giant Buddha and we were fortunate enough to have a taxi that drove us up to the Big Buddha so we only had to come down the stairs instead of up the stairs.Great views and a Great Buddha.
It certainly is a big buddha!,This was one part of a day trip. We drove in via the back but you can climb many stairs at the front. The views are really good from the base of the buddha. You can go in at the bottom and visit an information centre. Good way to spend an hour.
Big budha,"Beautiful place, better to go during the week than on weekends (a bit overcrowded with tourists) The inside, which is not very worth it, not a lot to see inside, but it is only a few $ so it is ok if you go, you dont loose much"
Big Bhudda,"Well worth a visit, it is so impressive . Pity the cable car was not working when we went. The notice blamed Coronavirus for it not working ??"
Mystical and magical,"So you can easily do this attraction in half a day, you can take the MTR right to Lantau Island and take the cable car to the village where Big Buddha is held. Bring comfy shoes because it is a hike to get up to the Buddha, but very worth it! The cable ride is a lot of fun, you can see the people hiking below you. The Village itself is very quaint as well."
Historic landmark,"Good to see but the area can be quite touristy. Not too busy at the end of January though. The steps to get up to the Buddha were a challenge, even for the fittest visitors. The vegetarian restaurant by the monastery was also a bonus with a taster meal included in our ticket. Cable car was closed, I think due to Chinese New Year so bear this in mind if you visit around this time. Well worth the bus trip to get there though."
nie short trip to get out of hong long for a day,The gondolas were shutdown so we had to take the 45 min bus ride from the mtr station (tung chung?).  bus was full but it had some nice views of local mountains and the coastline.  Climbing the stairs (250?) can be a chore for some but take your time.  The view is amazing and there is a bathroom near the top.  The displays inside are interesting and look great.  We also checked out the gift shops.  They were not that expensive and had some really nice stuff...chopstick sets and jewellery.
Breathtaking From Afar or Up Close!,"We saw this as part of a tour out of Hong Kong. The cable car to get up is pretty awesome so you want to do that too, From there a van met us and drove us near enough to the top so we did not have to walk all of the steps. It is an amazing piece when you consider the effort that it took to make. Regardless of your religious beliefs, you have to respect the size and scope of it. Great statues around it as well and great views from the top. Either see it with a tour or go on your own, but don't  miss it when in Hong Kong."
Worth a half day,"We took the bus to the Big Buddha since the cable car was not running and had a great half day climbing the steps, viewing the relic, and visiting the monastery.  The Buddha is amazing. Be aware that it is over 200 steps to get up to the Buddha so take your time, it's worth the climb for the views all around."
Worth the time!,"Take the time to visit the ‚ÄúBig Buddha‚Äù and monastery when visiting Hong Kong!   Once one clears the numerous shops and tourist attractions, one will find the steps up to the ‚ÄúBig Buddha‚Äù. Take the time and energy to climb to the peak!  Take time not only to see the views but to read the historical information presented inside the monument.    Once back down, be sure to visit the numerous buildings that make up the compound of this functioning monastery!  They are breathtakingly beautiful!   We were fortunate enough to witness part of a service on our visit.The return trip down the mountain on the top of a double decker bus was in and of itself an adventure as we descended the winding and steep mountain road!  Transportation and facilities are well organized and more than adequate to handle the visitors!"
Very Impressive,"Firstly, I underestimated the size of the Buddha itself that being said it was beautiful to see and I can see why there were loads of people around to see it"
Beautiful ,-Take the Ngong Ping cable car to get here-It‚Äôs a short walk from Ngong Ping Village-268 steps to reach the top-The Big Buddha is made of bronze and is 112 ft tall-The view from the top is amazing! you can view the mountains and the monastery nearby. -It‚Äôs so peaceful!-This is worth leaving the airport for a layover trip-We got there around 9am and there‚Äôs no crowd
A long haul up over 200 steps but worth it.,"Worth the exhausting walk up the steps but the Budda is brilliant. Views behind the Budda of the other side of the island are excellent on a clear day.  There is not a great deal of room at the top so it can become really congested. There is a museum inside the Budda which is well worth visiting.Beware - By the entrance at the bottom of the stairs there is a booth where you may assume that you have to pay to see the Budda. You don't, the fee is for a meal at the Monestry later. However that turns out to quite a bargin and enjoyable in itself."
One Buddha like another,"The trip up in the cable car was the highlight, very high and not for the faint hearted.  The Big Buddha at the top was OK but an extra charge to reach it I'm not sure is worth it."
Well worth the climb,"A fabulous cable car ride, a short walk and then a climb up lots of steps brings the substantial reward of amazing views and an inspiring monument.  Climb back down and turn right to the monastery which is worth a few hours of anyone's time.  Vibrant colours, stunning architecture and lovely surrounds.  As a contrast to the craziness of Hong Kong a trip to Lantau Island and the Big Buddha is worth the full day it really requires."
Pretty good to see ,This was a pretty fun thing to see. It's big and impressive enough and can go on afew walks around nearby in the lovely bush. The cable car going up is the bigger highlight though
Rain or stairs I made it,It rained but we decided to walk up those stairs anyways and was not disappointed. Breathtaking views regardless and something you gotta see while visiting Hong Kong. Try going during the Chinese New Year and you get to see some festive culture!
Should be family trip WITH elderly,"The cable car is the worse. Elderly or those walking with walking sticks were not given priority nor a waiting place for them. The queues were cut by saying ""we are together"".@ the big buddha, those people picnic behind the buddha and eating meats! The taste foods that restaurant selling is not up to the value of the charges I'm so disappointed with this trip to Lantau Island (Big buddha)"
Nice day trip from Hong Kong,"My wife and I took a day trip from Kowloon via subway. The travel is easy and uncomplicated. Between the final subway station and the cable car station, only a short, 5 minute walk, there is a giant indoor discount mall, for those who might be interested. The cable car ride is about 6 km long and provides, among other things, a spectacular aerial view of the airport and the surrounding mountains. There are two cable car options, one slightly more expensive with a glass bottom to the car. At the terminus of the cable car there is a kitschy village with a number of shops you have to walk through, but that can actually provide a little rest and diversion before you get to the Big Buddha. The crowds can be extremely large but the site is impressive and it‚Äôs a fun and interesting way to spend the day!"
Definitely worth the visit ,"Easily get to via MTR. Lucky it was not busy, crowded, and the weather was great. The Buddha and the temple are next to each other. Taking the tram was a nice experience and great views of the airport, mountain and the longest bridge from Hong Kong to Macao to China. Be prepare for long flight of stairs to get to the top of the Buddha."
Cable car trip,"Only had morning before our flight,  but was a really nice trip , you could have spent longer up the mountain as bars restraints shops . But still worth going for hour or two as we did . Don‚Äôt think it would be worth it if not a clear day ."
Tian Tan Big Buddha,A must see when in Hong Kong. Get the Ngong Ping 360 cable car from Tung Chung at Lantau up the mountain to see this incredible 34m high bronze buddha. The views from the top are spectacular.
Great place to visit,"Travelled up by cable car which was fun.  Lots of shops and places to eat near the Buddha, and interesting things to see."
Great harmony and good Chinese vegetarian food,We were a family with two children. We took the cable car up to the Big Buddha. The ride was quite expensive but our children enjoyed it. All of the shops in the area is very expensive. I do highly recommend the vegetarian food on the left side of the temple. Walk to the end than you will se a stall with plenty of vegetarian food you can choose. The radish cake does test very good. So when you are up there do not forget to eat that. Our two children had great fun walking around the temple and Big Buddha. There are plenty of dogs walking and sleeping around the temple. Most of them are very friendly but still be careful with your children so they do not get bitten. /Henrik

When I saw the Buddha first, I was stunning. IMPRESSIVE. Also, there is so many restaurants and souvenir's shops that you can visit. If you are traveling in Hong Kong, you may have a look in those spot. In my case, the meals and drinks are a little bit expensive."
Worth seeing,"Went to this location using the cable car but you can get a bus also.It‚Äôs an awesome structure and if your in HK it‚Äôs one of those places you need to visit just for the architecture and the way they built this structure, it has a load of stairs to climb but it‚Äôs worth it for the views, you can have a meal if required at this location there are temples to see as well and shops at the village which is very close"
Very worthwhile visit,Used cable car to reach Giant Buddha. Very enjoyable. Lovely atmosphere and very interesting. Delicious and affordable local meal. Beautiful views.
Truely special,"Loved this day out. The glass bottom cable car ride was quite thrilling. Then the view of the buddha came into sight and took our breath away. Once off the cable car we made our way towards the buddha, a short walk away and climb the 268 steps to the top. The views and experience was majestic."
Lovely place,"Well worth a visit this place has a lovely atmosphere great shops and stalls and plenty to see. Temples are lovely, great local food and the Buddha itself is very impressive.Plenty of steps up to the Buddha but worth it for the views!I found this visit very tranquil calm and peaceful."
Fun excursion,One can take the cable car and climb up to the Big Buddha. The view is good and it is a great day out.
Mild climb and great views plus wildlife ,Big Buddha is one of those ‚Äúmust see‚Äù places in Hong Kong. It is very easy to get to by the Ngong Ping 360 cable car (which is a pricey but whole other attraction on its own). The climb up is a gentle one of 268 steps and the views from the top are worth the climb (which is free). There were also a few cows roaming around if you‚Äôre into that.
Cable car a must,"A great experience a bus which struggled up the hills.to.get there, the impressive buddha and fab views. The cable car ...just do it not nearly as scary as it looks and outstanding views."
Breathtaking,Knew this was going to be big but didnt appreciate how huge it actually was. Simply stunning. We were on a tour but had enough time to wander round and enjoy the scenery. Its another must do if visiting the area.
A beautiful hike up to see the Big Buddha,"If you choose to take the Ngong Ping cable car to the Big Buddha, you miss out on a really nice hike up to the top. Actually the hike and FINALLY at some point getting the first glimpse of the statue from a distance was the best part: the village with all tourists and souvenir shops was disappointing and ruined the feeling of a pilgrimage that we reached during the 2,5h uphill walk. We walked all the way from Tung Chung MTR station, and needed some Google Maps guidance to find the right path. We encountered maybe 5 people during the 10km walk. I recommend this hiking experience, but not to anyone who is not in a rather decent physical condition. Going up non stop for 2,5 hours can get a bit straining. However, challenging yourself and finally getting the reward of seeing the Buddha make it worth the effort! You can take the cable car down, and enjoy the ride. Before to go, check the cable car schedules to get down or prepare to walk back down, maybe in darkness."
Beautiful,"Had a great time. Beautiful site. Well cared for cows walk around. Finely detailed, decorated buildings. Great food to eat while visiting. The NPing30 was such a smooth, relaxing way to the site."
Impressive ,"Not only the giant Buddha but also the temple. The vila is very comercial and full of tourists trap. If you are looking for a proper local lunch go into the Buddhist temple, the best vegetarian meal I had in HK."
Sommet to Heaven,"Everybody have felt different spiritual visions about the Tian Tan Buddha but When You reach the path to stay close to him, You can feel the great and open world of love that invited the humble emotions to opening the doors to our hearts."
Great visit,"I didn‚Äôt expect this place to be as tranquil and peaceful as it was. Definitely worth a visit.  We did the cable car up and the view is worth the ride. The themed village is definitely gimmicky but also pleasant enough. We had lunch at Po Lin monestery and discovered we really like sago pudding and the monestery itself was spectacular. Rather than catch the cable car back down we caught the bus to Tai O fishing village. The smell of fish is overwhelming but we enjoyed visiting and found it interesting. The bus ride back to Tung Chung MTR with the smell of fish and winding roads was a challenge but doable, was overall a great day out."
Amazing Buddha statue ,Great couple hour trip. Do the sky team for sure. About a 20 minute ride and very scenic. The Buddha is amazing. A bit touristy in the town but not detracting. Well worth the trip.
Top of the mountain...,Took the cable car up to the village and had the chance to visit various monuments to Buddhism. A decent hike up the steps and great views. Enjoy.....
Nice place to visit while in Hong Kong,"We got a 2 for 1 ticket for the cable car, tour of the big Buddha and Tai O fishing village, which was great value for money. We were told about these deals at the tourism office. You can check for deals on hkison.com , which is apparently by the tourism board. The cable car ride is nice and smooth, with great views to the airport for the plane watchers. The Buddha is impressive in size (we were told the second biggest sitting Buddha in the world), and the Monastery nearby is nice to visit. Our tour started with the most beautiful demonstration of the blooming tea at the Tea House, right next to cable car terminal. The tour also gave us the fast pass to the cable car, which was a life saver given the extra long line."
"Seemed a bit of a gimmick, really, but if you have the time, worth going for the views from the cable car","Definitely take the 3.5 mile cable car to this attraction on Lantau Island. Hiking there will take you at least 4-6 hours. Very touristy but this huge Buddha is impressive. If you are able, buy your ticket from a park worker before the entrance so you can skip the ticket line, if there is one. Even with the cable ride, you still have to climb 268 steep steps to get to Tian Tan, the Big Buddha.My favorite part was the cable car ride -- what a view -- of Hong Kong, the airport, the Big Buddha -- and I also enjoyed the feral cows on the premises. Not sure I would pick this attraction if my time were limited. Cable car was 220 rmb pp."
Tian Tan Buddha,"We caught the ferry from Central Pier to Mui Wo and then a bus to Tian Tan Buddha. The bus only runs every 1.5 hours so it worth checking ferry and bus times before you go. The Buddha is good and worth the trip. However we were a little disappointed as our expectations were quite high as we've seen lots of Buddhas in Sri Lanka and Japan. Don't forget to visit the Po Lin Monestary which is right beside the Buddha/ We caught the cable car back down which has great views over out over the Sea, the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge and the HK International Airport. Check the visibility before you go because if it is cloudy or hazy you won't be able to see anything."
Just breathtaking ,You can read about this but until you visit you really cannot appreciate itThe fantastic sight of the big Buddha sitting overlooking all it surveys is breathtaking We got there early so it wasn‚Äôt too crowdedOne of the most memorable sights I‚Äôve ever seen and definitely one of my favourites
Very impressive,We visited the Tian Tan Buddha on a short trip to Hong Kong. We went directly from the airport on the way in as we thought that would be the easiest option rather then heading   into Hong Kong and back. We took the cable car up and back. Our flight landed about 1pm and we were able to get up and back  before the cable car closed.Once we arrived at the top it was a short walk past some restaurants and shops before reaching the stairs you have to walk up to get to the buddha.Its very beautiful but also very busy. There was also a monastery next to the buddha so we spent some time there as well which was lovely.There is further to walk around the area if you have time but we did not have much time to exploreI think this is well worth a visit and easy to get to. The cable car is another experience you can use to get there. I think you can also get a bus if you dont want to get the cable car.
Nice day out,"A nice way to escape the Hong Kong shopping mess.If you are lucky to go there on a sunny day it is really worth spending your time and relax in this beautiful space. Do choose the cable car to go, the view is really fantastic"
Spectacular views and well worth the trip,"If you‚Äôre on a stopover or have 2-3 hours free, this is well worth the trip. The location is very easy to get to via mtr to Tung Chung station then you can either take the bus or cable car to the big Buddha. We took the cable car and the views were spectacular. Due to low season at the moment, the place was very peaceful, we paid for the tickets to see the relic at the big Buddha and also got a full vegetarian meal with dessert at the temple which was worth it. The place is very serene and a nice getaway - highly recommend it."
The second largest buddha in the world,"421/5000Arriving from Hong Kong to the island of Lantau is already an adventure and climbing to the Great Buddah is the culmination of it, you will have to climb many stairs and once up you can admire all the complexpo that is also composed of a temple that is worth the worth visiting.The views are splendid and you can also find shops with souvenirs in the surroundings, as well as some cows that are loose along the way."
Pretty amazing. Good for tourists.,"I have been there once. Yes. The Big Buddha is amazing and gigantic. You can even get inside the buddha. However, too many stairs and there is not really interesting spot except for this buddha. Still, the crystal cable car, one with a transparent floor, will give you amazing experiences."
A remarkable place. ,Amazing place located at the mountain top near the nong ping village. Big buddha is a must visit.  adrenaline junkies can take the nong ping trail which is a medium level hike where the first hill is quiet steep and afterwards it's a can do trek. Those who dont want to sweat can take the cable car from tung Chung right to the peak. Big buddha is located about another 260 steps uphill.
Fantastic experience,Great chair-lift ride to the Big Buddha; provided some spectacular views.  We were lucky to travel at a quiet time due to being off-peak as well as the effect of the protests.  Was a great trip.  Highly recommended.
Great,"I try and travel as cheap as possible and as I already went to Lion Rock and Victoria peak I didn‚Äôt mind not using the Cable car.If your the same then get the subway to Tung Chung and get the no. 23 bus as some on here have said. What I didn‚Äôt read was that on a Sunday the price changes. Monday - Saturday it‚Äôs $17 and on Sundays & public holidays it‚Äôs $27. One way.I enjoyed the Buddha. It was free to go up but you can pay for a meal ticket and to go into the Buddha. The monastery was very nice too and it had the hall of 10,000 buddhas - it was so peaceful inside. The village is a typical tourist site. (It has a Starbucks & subway if that proves it) All in all I really enjoyed my trip :)"
Very nice village ,Easy access from the Ngong ping cable car. The village has got some nice sights and it‚Äôs a stop to check out the Tai O fishing village.
Very worthwhile,We took the train out and then the cable car. Walking around is lovely and the walk up to the big Buddha was great. Would recommend the vegetarian restaurant located near the main monastery
Beautiful place and view ,A beautiful view while taking the cable car. It's a must see race in Hong Kong and there is a Outlet very close to the cable car station for those who love shopping.
Must visit,I took the glass bottom cable car (must do) from Ngong Ping. View was amazing.There's an area with statues of chinese zodiac which I found really cool. Tourists were amused by the cows walking around as well. They looked very tamed. There are plenty of shops and restaurants (both western and eastern) on the way to big buddha statue. Prices were fairly reasonable. There's a nice tea store as soon as you enter the village with really nice staff. Feel free to check it out if you are a tea buff like me.There are plenty of steps to climb so will be your cardio workout for the day. But the views and the feeling at the top well worth it.If you buy a ticket I think you can go to a balcony just under the buddha statue I didn't do it.If you have time please add this to your list. You will never regret as this was one of my highlights of the Hong Kong trip.
Worth a visit,"Went to see the big budha, on the cable car, the cable car journey is really good and long and well worth it and includes the entrance to big budha, there are shops and places to eat when you get up there, you can walk up if you want and are very fit."
Pleasant Experience,"We took the cable car up and down to Ngong Ping. It is cheaper to take the bus up or down, but you may want both experiences. Climbing the stairs up to Big Buddha is not hard; we are both fit. We explored the accessible parts of the monastery and ate lunch at one of the newer restaurants. We would have given the sites five stars if there was some sort of information while we were touring that didn't require scanning QR codes to get to buggy websites. Perhaps an english audio tour or similar. We wanted a more accessible way to learn about what we were seeing. We spent approximately three hours all-in-all here. It is very close to the airport, so we did this experience on our way out of Hong Kong."
Amazing,"We booked a guided tour to the ""Big Buddha"" during our 3 night stopover on Hong Kong. Absolutely jaw-dropping."
Great view and really cool experience,The view from the cable car on the way to the Big Buddha is phenomenal. Would be interested to actually hike up next time. They offer really good vegetarian food at the temple as well.
Go for the Views,"We took a bus to the nearby village of Ngong Ping then walked to the giant Buddha, half way up Lantau Peak.¬† It is the largest seated, bronze Buddha in the world, according to the literature.¬† Which, when you think about it, means there could be several larger standing Buddhas or reclining Buddhas and probably a fair few seated Buddhas made of alternative materials.¬† But it was still worth the visit, not least for the views and natural surroundings."
Wonderful view and great photo opportunities,"Easy day in HK.  I took the MTA to Lantau Island and walked a short distance to the gondolas.  I went for the regular ride, not the glass bottom gondola, and was very happy with the views.  The walk to the Buddha was wonderful in the pleasant weather.  Lots of commercial stores, but I enjoyed the more local shops tucked away behind the big stores.  The 100 steps to the Buddha were easy to climb, and the view from the top was worth all the effort.   I also bought some ""monk blessed"" items as gifts at the bottom of the stairs.  Nice quality.  Prices okay, but it was a donation."
Go for the view,"My partner and I went and I‚Äôm not sure what we were expecting but it wasn‚Äôt quite what we arrived at. The Buddha is not really historic as it was built in the 90‚Äôs. We took the cable car which was great and the views are spectacular, you can also hike but it looks like you would need to be quite fit to do it, 25 mins in a cable car one way versus 3hrs by foot?When you arrive you‚Äôre instantly faced with gift shop after gift shop of tacky merchandise. Hurry through these and you get to a number of flags and the the steps up to the Buddha. The best thing about this place is the views down to the surrounding islands but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a place of enlightenment."
No Bad Weather warnings given,"We paid to go both ways in the glass bottom gondola. It was alright as we set off but by the top you could not see the ground or the gondola in front.The village of shops at the top were good and we saw one of the sacred cows. BUT, After climbing the steps we could still not see the top of the Buddah.We came down with no visibility and only when we got down did the visibility clear.No signs and no warnings given before we played 60 plus pounds for the trip and the staff were not interested."
Must-go for Travellers,"The Big Buddha in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, is a popular attraction to go for travellers for several points. With more than 100 steps of stairs, you can challenge with your friends or yourself. Once you reached the destination, you will see the beautiful scenery of Lantau Island as well as the Tian Tan Buddha. Do go to the Big Buddha if you visit Hong Kong and pray for yourself and your beloved!"
Good day out,After an enjoyable ride in the gondola we found the place very peaceful.  This time there is a lack of tourists which makes it more enjoyable to be able to stroll about.
Lantau Island major attraction,"The main attraction on Lantau Island is the large bronze Buddha statue, completed in 1993, it is located ten minutes on foot from the Ngong Ping Cable Car Terminal.  To reach the Buddha there are 268 steps to climb, there are plenty levels between sets of stairs to rest or take in the view and staircase adornments.  After walking around outside the statue on the two levels we ventured inside where no photographs are allowed to pay respect the those who have passed and are remembered on the walls.  Also inside on the walls are photographs and information on the construction of Big Buddha which only a few notice."
Great views,"A great trip with spectacular views, a pleasant walk through the village takes you up to the stairs to the Buddha. Great sight."
Amazing views of the island and Big Buddha via cable car!,"Take the cable car (about 25min) or walk the trail (about 3hrs of stone and wooden steps within the trees up the mountain) to the top of Ngong Ping to the Big Buddha.Once you get to the top their is a small village with food and shopping (tasty ice cream place - we tried ) and if you keep walking you see the Giant Buddha to your right. You can climb stairs to get closer, then take the time to visit the temple. Very beautiful scenery and peaceful."
Breath taking !! Beautiful !,"It was a fantastic place to visit , the Buddha is immense , stands so tall within the islands .. Stunning .. Really peaceful, tranquil setting"
Highly recommend.,Visiting the largest Bronze seated Buddha in the world is a must. take the cable car or if you are feeling fit & healthy you can walk up but it is steep.
Amazing place to visit by cable car,An amazing place to visit and the only way is by cable car. Easy to get to using the MTR and a short walk to cable car station. Very commercialised area to walk through but the temple and Buddha are breathtaking.Definitely worth a visit.
Big in Stature,"Survived for very long time throughout a turbulent history, still attrarcting pilgrims and tourists alike for whatever reasons."
An Truly Breathtaking Monument,The size of this Buddha is like nothing i could have imaginedThe steps up are part of the experience
Peaceful and blissful ,Must visit if you are in hongkong. Very peaceful and the cable car to it is also very scenic. Had a great experience
Great trip,We got there when it opened around 10am on a weekday and it was already busy. If you want a good vegetarian meal I'd recommend the Japanese place in the square near the cable car rather than the temple food which didn't look fresh and seemed targeted at tourists. The Japanese place had a full page of veggie food in the menu and you could have a beer in the sun.  Recommended arriving by MTR and cable car - the bus wasn't much cheaper but took ages and walking is more like hiking - both up and down - and would take at least 3 hours each way (going down still involves some going up!). Recommend the wisdom walk - only about 20 minutes but much quieter than the rest of it.
"There are a LOT of steps, but worth the effort to climb them",The grounds around the Big Buddha are really nice.  There are things to do.  Lots of shops.   Then you get to the stairs that lead to the Big Buddha.  You have be psychologically ready to climb what seems like an endless number of stairs.  I had to stop once or twice to catch my breath and give my legs a break.  It was worth it though.  From every distance the Buddha looks beautiful.   When you get up close it is HUGE and wonderful.  Put on your sneakers and go - you will be glad you did.
Huge,The whole experience of visiting the Tian Tan Buddha is majestic. From the cable car ride up from the MTR to actually climbing up to and around the Buddha it is a very well organised and enjoyable experience.The sound of piped Christmas carols on the approach to the Buddha was a little surreal.The structure is massive and quite awe-inspiring.
amazing place,well worth the visit it‚Äôs an amazing space and statue with spectacular views lots of steps though so take your time.
Fantastic,Travelled to Lantau on the MTR but arrived too early and had to wait for the cable car service to open.  The cable car trip is a long way with excellent views.  We were surprised by the ambience when we arrived.  The Big Buddha is very impressive.  We also loved the flowers displayed in the monastery.  We left feeling very relaxed and chilled.  Would definitely recommend
It's ok,We took the cable car to the top of the mountain.There was far to much up hill walking to make it to the base of the Buddha.
Loved it.,We took the Cable car up to the Big Buddha but after seeing the pathway below us from the car we actually regretted not doing the walk as it look stunning.
World‚Äôs largest outdoor bronze Buddha!,And 268 steps to reach the top. But it is totally worth it!  I recommend taking the cable car up from the Citygate mall in Tung Chung. It is a great adventure in itself (get a glass bottom crystal car) and it is great to summit the first mountain on the range and to see the Big Buddha come into view. There is a while village near the base where you can get souvenirs and a bite to eat. The view from the top is amazing making this a Hong Kong must-do.
Good view,"Cable car is the fastest way to get there. Cultural and scenic, worth a visit. Don't mistake Budda as fat baby like my silly bf did."
Good day,Great experience to visit Big Buddha. Long steps but not very difficult. It has lots of restaurants and shops nearby. You will see healthy and friendly cows wandering round on the ground.
Must see attraction when you visit Hong Kong!,Visiting The Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery were highlights of our stay in Hong Kong. It was a 35 minute taxi ride from our hotel by the airport to the Big Buddha. You could also take a cable car to the Buddha from a town close to the airport. We got there right as they opened. It was so quiet and peaceful. We climbed the 256+ stairs to the top (took about 5-7 minutes) where the views of Po Lin Monastery and Lantau Island were amazing and seeing the Buddha up close was a great experience.
Great Place,"An exiting view on the hill of the Tian Tang Buddha made of bronze. The statue is 34 metres tall, weighs over 250 metric tons, and was constructed from 202 bronze pieces. Constructed from 1990 till 1993."
Worth a visit.,"Joined a Viator tour to go see the Big Buddha. Haven't been there since I was a kid when I lived in HK. It was a great experience to see the Buddha and its surrounding, also you will see the Buddha's relic... which was a bit hard to see but if you are a Buddhist then probably worth it. A good trip though regardless."
Great location - but allow whole day out so you can also see traditional village.,"This expedition was well worth the visit, buy the cable care tickets in advance online to avoid queues. The area surrounding the Buddha itself is very touristy but still worth it."
A must do in Hong Kong! ,"A spectacular monument! Especially once you finished the steps you are on the top of the world. The view was panoramic. Clear air and blue sky, tranquil. Get your own experience."
Bucket List momeny,The tram ride to the top is beautiful and the 268 to Big Buddha is worth it no matter how many times you stop on the way.  Take the city bus going and leaving; you‚Äôll save a bundle and the view is spectacular
Great Views from the Top,"Lovely peaceful area.  Lots of steps to the top (not suitable for disabled) but still an awesome view from the bottom which is wheelchair friendly.  Definitely worth the visit and the steps if you are able.  There is also a lovely little shopping village, plenty of places to eat/snack. Travelled by MTR from Central, then by local bus to fishing village, local bus to Tian Tan Buddha and local bus again back to the MTR - cost less than ¬£10 each for whole trip.  Fishing village also has little boat trips to see the white dolphins approx ¬£3 each."
Big guy,The visit is worth while with an excellent guide. The scenery both around and inside the monastery was fabulous.
Giant Bronze Buddha,"Tian Tan Buddha was a gift from the Hong Kong government to the government of China when the British handed Hong Kong back to them. If you thought this was made in another century, wrong guess. The place is very well preserved and it is nice to feel some nature in a city so packed of buildings and cars like Hong Kong. The site is located in an island called Lantau.PROs: get a nice picture, have a nice walk, learn the history of BuddhaCONs: you need to get a tour to take you there or the cable car"
Worth a visit,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Buddha via the cable car. It was about 250 steps to get to the top but the view from there was sensational. We spent about 45 minutes there just taking in the majesty of it all. Then further on from the base is a temple of 10,000 buddhas. Wow! What a beautiful place. Well worth a visit to this beautiful place"
The Tian Tan (The Big Buddha) on Lantau Island ,One of the best things to do away from the centre of Hong Kong.Combination of MTR and Cable Car (or #23 bus for a fraction of the cost) will get you to the base and then a couple of hundred steps to reach the Buddha. Requires reasonable fitness to climb the steps but is worth it for the spiritual experience and the views from the top.
"Beautiful visit, a bit touristy","It is an absolutely lovely trip, getting out of the city and experience the buddha, but it is an experience slightly hollowed by the amount of tourist shops you have to pass before you actually get to it. Still worthwhile though! Make sure to take the cable car there for a beautiful trip!"
AWESOME SIGHT,it is definitely a wonderful and beautiful tourist sight.We enjoyed the surrounding temples and history. We enjoyed this tour
WOW,"You could walk up the mountain to see the Big Buddha if you want to but we took the cable car and were blown away by the views, Wonderful experience - just WOW"
Fantastic views from the cable car,"We went up by cable car which gave fantastic views of Lantau, HK airport, Hong Kong and surrounding areas.  The Buddha is very impressive and worth the climb up.  We also went to the monastery and the room of Buddha‚Äôs is amazing.  It was a peaceful and tranquil place."
Great day out ,Had a bus trip to this amazing TempleVery informative tour guide who could answer all our questions. The temple is is a very peaceful place and the giant Buddha is amazing .  Well with the visit
Trip to see The Big Bhudda,We travelled by MTR to Tung Chung station and then took the cable car to the village. Spectacular views right over Hong Kong and great view of the Bhudda on approach.  We spent about 3 hours there in total visiting the Temple and climbing the many steps to see the Bhudda.  There are  lot of tourist shops and restaurants in the village but we chose to to pay for the meal ticket on our entry to the Bhudda which allowed you access to the exhibition of the temple relics and on return down to the Temple we then ate a delicious vegetarian meal at the Temple Restaurant.  All proceeds go towards the upkeep of the Temple.We throughly enjoyed our time there and would recommend the trip to everyone.
Amazing place to be,"6km cable car ride to get there (or you can walk along trail through forest - not advised thou, hills are like small mountains). Cable car departs at bus station area and very short walk to shopping village with restaurants, gift shops etc. (Chopstick shop is really interesting). Walk on to monastery and then you reach the steps. 272 steps up to Big Buddha. It's great to view, but not gonna lie, a killer to climb - lovely coming down thou. It's well worth the visit. Get there real early and then take bus to 'TIA O'. Will have enough time to return to cable car before 5pm close. Really good experience."
Amazing,"Really spectacular sight Great cable car ride with amazing views Really nice little village to walk through up to the  Buddha statue The steps up are a little tough but you can take your time There is a small fee to go inside and walk up to the top of the Buddha, you also get a free food and drink voucher for the vegetarian food store which has really nice food Amazing view from the rear down into the bay We did the train then cable car but you can also do a bus or walk if your crazyNeed a couple of hours up there to see everything"
Wonderful visit! ,Took the MTR to Tung Chung Station then got the cable car up to the Village. (Book online for discount) We must have been lucky as it wasn‚Äôt busy and there were no queues at 10am on a Thursday. Cable car ride is spectacular with 360 degree views and the Buddha and surrounding area was breathtaking. So peaceful. Be mindful there are a lot of steps up to the Buddha! We paid for the vegetarian lunch at the monastery made by the monks and it was delicious.  Spend some time exploring the temples and village before getting the cable car back down.
Breadth taking!,"It was an amazing experience.  I was taken back by the size of the Buddha statue.  It is only when you see it in person that you realize not only how big it is, but how amazing and beautiful it is.  Definitely, it is a must to visit.  I took the Ferry to the Lantau Island and that was amazing and beautiful.  You get to see a lot of the Hong Kong skyline.  Once I got there, I walked around the village.  The village is wonderful and has a lot of nice restaurants and bars"
Impressive Statue in a nice location,Impressive Statue in a nice location.There is a big and nice to see temple situated further down the street.At best you take the cable car from Ting Chung MTR station to get there. You them can walk through the nicely done traditinal village with many little shops and restaurants.
Long Journey,"To get to the Big Buddha we took the E23 bus to Tung Chung Fire Station (about one hour from East Kowloon) and then transferred to the 23 bus (opposite side of the road; about 30 minutes journey time) which wasn't for the faint hearted and/or easily travel sick!Upon arriving at the site we found it to be almost desolate, and we went at mid day; sadly this was probably due to Hong Kong's political issues at the time. It wasn't hard to find the Big Buddha (just look up) and it wasn't much of a walk to the top. As mentioned by many, admission to simply walk to the summit and around the landmark is free, you can also pay to have something to eat in the restaurant at the top. There isn't much to do other than walk around the landmark and admire the views which can be particularly spectacular on misty days I've heard. To exemplify the emptiness of our visit, we managed to get photos at the foot of the statue without having to wait for anyone to move. Unfortunately the village at the bottom seemed lifeless due to the vast reduction in tourists on the day, but equally this made the experience more unique to us. To conclude, it is probably worth the long journey there and back, we stayed for about 1 hour 30 minutes, but I can't comment on what it's like at busy times. Still, it is an amazing site, the statue is truly massive!"
Wounderful place ,The Tian Tan Buddha is a must visit place while in Hong Kong. Around 260 steps to the Buddha but well worth the effort. Also nice to go and see the Po Lin Monastery temple and get some local food while here.  Found the whole area to be very quiet but I put this down to the current situation in HK. Please don‚Äôt be put of by the trip as I felt very safe throughout my visit & didn‚Äôt encounter any problems. I used the MTR from Honk Kong Central to Sunny bay as Tung Chung station was closed (a free coach service was running from Sunny bay to Tung Chung) Then used the Tung Chung cable car to get upto Tian Tan Buddha - this was fairly expensive (470 HKD for 2 x adults return - approx ¬£47) but you get some great views of the airport and the country park & takes around 25 minutes from start to finish.
Wonderful and exciting place!!!,Great place and quiet. Lots of rides to reach The Lantau. Very exciting since the scenery is just beautiful. You will never get bored going to this place. In addition to that; there are a lot of souvenirs to buy. Highly recommended.
Very long queue it‚Äôs a nightmare ,"I was in Hong Kong for business and I had a Sunday free. I thought I‚Äôd better go to Tian Tan Buddha than as going alone to Disneyland as an adult (without kid or companion). So off I go by MTR to Tung Chung station. The station to take cable car to Lantau island is just opposite Tung Chung station. I saw people already queue there; there were two lines, one was much faster and no queue while the other line was slow and there was queue. Being not having ticket or made any reservation, a man showed me to take the dedicated line for those who have not had any ticket or reservation. And this line is very, very long and slow. Unlike the other line, for those who have had ticket on their hand or have made reservation, which was by far much faster and less people. So I suggest if you want to go to Tian Tan Buddha, book in advance or purchase your tickets online rather than just show up like I did. I ended up spending 1.5 hour queuing!!! There was no going back, I thought I was there already and it‚Äôs quite far from my hotel in Wan Chai (around 1 hour until I got there with MTR); so I made up my mind and stayed in the queue... I could not tell if I was ok though, I was a bit pissed off to myself why would I do such a thing and spent so long in the queue just to get there?!I bought standard ticket (not crystal cabin) as actually I am kinda afraid of height. I did not want to have floor that‚Äôs see through because I would feel like falling if nothing is beneath my feet! The cable car ride lasted for about 20 minutes and I must admit that it was an amazing journey. The view from above was spectacular and I immediately forgot the pissed off feeling that I felt from the queue.  Cable car arrived in a nice and charming village of Ngong Ping. Lots of shops and restaurants here. If you pass this village, then you‚Äôll arrive in the stairs that will take you to the Buddha. I did not count the stairs, although some said there were 268 steps but I did it less than 10 minutes. Maybe 5 minutes only. They were not that bad as I was imagining.The Buddha was big and impressive but also there is monastery around the Buddha and I enjoyed the atmosphere around monastery. It was quiet and serene, with sound of birds chirping from among the trees and branches. It was nice! I sat on a bench outside monastery tried to take in the atmosphere while thinking if I should wait until sunset or not. Glad that I did not, because when I decided to go back to cable car station to take me back to Hong Kong island, I saw the queue was worse than the morning. Thousands of people already lined up for cable car since Ngong Ping village! It was unbelievable!!! I could not bear the thought of how long would it take until I get a cable car and be back to Hong Kong, and to my hotel? It got dark fast and by 6 pm it was completely dark already. It took me more than 2 hours just to reach the station!!! So total queue I made that day was about 4 hours!!!The minus point about this trip was the queue, it was a nightmare! Really! Although Lantau island is quite close from Hong Kong, but it was an all day trip. Allow yourself to have all day if you want to visit this Buddha, especially on weekend. I don‚Äôt know how it would be if I visited it on weekdays, perhaps less people. I don‚Äôt think I want to go back again in near future though...because thinking about the queuing only is really putting me off."
Don‚Äôt miss it,This place is magic with lots of amazing energy and it was an experience to be there. Everybody so helpful and smiley. Try the food also at the temple.
Maybe overrated but it's Buddha,"I've seen plenty of temples and places like this in my past but this here was crowded! Probably theee main attaction. If it's a must visit? Yes, I'd totally go for that. Our bad that we woke up late that day and thus missed the early entrance we planned. But as time was short we had to go this day. Anyway, I think this Buddah has something special, to me at least. The reflection of the statue and with the view in combination left me totally relaxed, I forgot about the crowds around."
Must visit,"A nice trip outside of Hong Kong to see the beautiful views of the airport and the Hong Kong skyline from the cable car.  To me the temple at the base was a better visit than the Buddha hill and statue itself.  As is common with all things Hong Kong, they have made it too commercial with shops, eateries, loud tourists, etc.  But, I guess that's Hong Kong.Tip:  during high season pre-book the cable car tickets and be prepared to stand in line to board."
Must see while in HK,"The tian tan Buddha is really worth one day of your stay in HK. It takes roughly one hour by ferry to reach Lantau island from Central and then probably 20 mn by bus to reach the site.The big Buddha itself is amazing, on top of the long stairs, but the temple and the ll area is also worth the visit, for the site itself as well as for the ambiance.You will also find a pretty good vegetarian restaurant inside the Temple"
Very touristic but very impressive,"The views from the cable car and from the foot of the hill are breathtaking. Do not miss the beautiful temple nearby. There can be a lot of people, so a lot of queues if you take the cable car up and down. A slightly more expensive ticket for the ""crystal"" floor cabins puts you in the (very) short queue to these cabins."
A good place to relax,"Having stress at work or at home, need some time away to relax? This is the best for you . After several months working nonstop, my husband and I took some time off and Hong Kong was just the place for us and definitely Big Buddha did justice to our stay. So affordable and costumer service is top notch."
Wonderful Trip,"One should  leave in the Morning and take the mtr up to tsung Chung and than take Bus nr 23 to ngong Ping. Bus costs only 55 hkd for a dayticket  at lantau.....the area around the buddha is wonderful!In the monastry you will find a nice vegetarian Restaurant.....In you choose the cable Car from mtr Station, please book tickets in advance, as sometimes queueing only for buying tickets can take around 2 Hours.....the view with the Bus going around the landscape is nicer and cheaper."
Great Big Buddha,"I took the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car to the Tian Tan Buddha and Po Lin Monastery area. The cable car ride was a fun trip - I would recommend purchasing tickets online and if you pay a little bit extra for the ""crystal car"" the queues were shorter.The Buddha statue is actually quite new (completed in 1993) but still impressive.The Po Lin monastery area was peaceful"
Well worth a visit!,"When you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of central HK, this is the ideal place to visit.Cable car to get there offers fantastic views.The Buddha itself is incredible to see close up.Other things to see and do, including Chalin dncers and sacred cows."
a good place to clear your mind ,it's a peaceful and beautiful place especially after the incident in Hongkong you won't see full of mainland people anymore
Mark Richards ,"The most beautiful, peaceful place. There is definitely something going on here, something special. Every town should have one. I loved it, we all did. The minute you turn up youre just in awe of the place, a certain calm comes over you..and stays gor days. The world suddenly seems a better place.Go see. Go now."
Interesting to see,"I‚ÄômNot a religious person at all but this is worth a trip.  The cable car ride provides a good view but not great for those afraid of heights.  It‚Äôs about 25 minutes.  The queues can be long so a good idea is to buy your tickets online first to skip that part of the queue.  The walk to Buddha is ok, but with quite a few steps but it‚Äôs worth it.  It‚Äôs an impressive sight."
The Big Buddha is BIG,An amazing sight from a long distance but even more impressive close up.  A very long flight of steps leading up to Buddha is worth the effort.  The Big Buddha is near the monastery which is beautifully restored and a wonderfully calm and peaceful place.  The monastery offers vegetarian meals which are delicious and excellent value.
"Hot, busy but worth it!","An essential destination whilst in HK. Take the cable car from the station, walkthrough the villages and climb around 240 steps to the top for an awesome photo moment."
Spiritual enlightenment with amazing views besides the Big Buddha,"Always on the list as an attraction to see when in Hong Kong and it is very impressive.However you get to Ngong Ping to get through the Ngong Ping Village and Po Lin Monastery, we recommend the cable car with the crystal bottom, the Big Buddha is stunning. You have to walk about 250 steps but it is manageable and there are stop points just on case. Once at the top you get to see the Big Buddha, the museum with a gift shop, an extra higher bit that you need to pay extra and the amazing views from there.Best checking beforehand whether the weather will be good, as I have been here when it's been cloudy and couldn't see the top of the Big Buddha!"
Amazing sight,"This was the second time we had visited - the first time was during a downpour so this time it was nice to see it in the sunshine.We also managed to go to the monastery as well, and this was beautiful.Took the Ngong Ping 360 to the top and wandered through the village shops to the Buddha. We booked a Crystal coach - a little more expensive but you do avoid some of the queues.Once we had looked around we also took a A21 bus down to the Tai O fishing village - the bus depot is situated behind the shops. After you can take a A11 from Tai O to the MTR station.Really great day."
Lantau highlights,"We visited the Big Buddha and monastery via the cable car on a weekday and it was a real highlight of our trip to Hong Kong. The cable car trip gives fantastic views over Lantau and the airport - those with a fear of heights beware,  it goes a long way above the ground! The tourist village at the top has a theme park feel,  not really our thing, but the Big Buddha and the monastery are beautiful and well worth the visit. We also got the bus down to Tai O which was fascinating with the stilt houses particularly interesting. It's worth checking the bus times though as the service is only hourly and was busy even on a comparatively quiet day. Judging by the queueing facilities at Tung Chang it will be very busy at weekends."
Simply Amazing!,"After leaving Victoria's Peak,  I Had more than enough time to do some exploring and wanted to see The Big Buddha. Simply Amazing!  As part of the experience,  i would definitely recommend taking the 20 minute cable car ride to the island to add to the beauty of the experience.   The cable car opens at 10a local time and my suggestion is to arrive about 30 minutes prior,  as the line increases by the second.  They also have options of upgrading to a Glass floor view.  Explore the Monastery and the shops in the village.   Also,  if the cable car is not your thing,  it is also accessible by taxi or bus.."
Big Budha Hiking! ,"there are 3 ways to get to the Big Budha: cable car, bus and hiking!.we've chosen walk till there. so, we've donwload a offline map (maps me) and from Tung Chung station we walked up till there. the map leaded us until a walking trail but the 'open way'lasted long just for the 1st 500m (1st pic). then we had more then 1 hour clibling and following a trail in the middle of the bush. there were RIBONS in the bush to lead the trail (pics 2 and 3). Until the last km, when the bush trail ended up to the normal track until the Big Budha place (pic 4). There you have a great square, can buy some water, snacks and be ready to climb a big stairs. it looks huge, but we climbed it in just 3min (we were still fit!üí™).From the top, you have a beautiful 360o view of the surrandings. I'm sure there is an easier way hiking track till up, but our offline map leaded us to the bushes and the hard trail."
The bast place for hiking,"You can take bus , the cable car or walking up. I did hiking up one time with my friend. It was the best day of my life for hiking up. The view so beautiful clear blue sky."
An Impressive Statue and Journey to Reach It,The Buddha is an impressive statue and well worth a visit. Lantau Island can be easily reached by smooth and cheap MTR train and the Buddha can be reached by a wonderful cable car ride lasting some 25 minutes or so. This gives great views of the island and the airport. The area before the Buddha has the usual tourist shops but these can be ignored although the ice cream parlour is worth a visit.
It could be better to see from afar rather than being there close,"This could be a good view to look at from a distance, especially when the sky is clear and the sun is setting.  However, when you get close by, there's nothing really special, everything is artificial and commercial.  It might not worth to travel so far just to visit a small place with a few small shops selling nothing special.But of course, if you want to try out the cable car, it could be another story."
Big Buddha!,"Worth the visit, it was very misty and rainy when I visited and about 100% humidity but still an enjoyable morning spent up there."
Good day trip.,We took the MTR then the sky lifts to the Buda. The sky lift can be done with clear bottom or regular we chose regular. About 20 minute lift ride to the small village and shops. Places to eat and shop. The big Buda was really cool and walking up the steps is not easy.
Quick trip,"Used Klook to pre purchase tickets. Was good as this allowed us to join a smaller queue and get the tickets cheaper. Went early at around 1030am, which was great because the queues started getting longer around midday. Great view on the cable car. Also had a nice snack at the temple."
Bug Buddha and Ngong Ping cable car,"Book your ticket in advance for the cable car and get a crystal car if you are not afraid of heights as the floor of the cable car is clear glass. Now I am not a lover of heights but both the cable car and the glass floor make it an awesome trip. If you book the glass cab then the queues are much shorter and for me this was a must. Also try to get there as soon as possible in the morning before the coach parties arrive, again less queueing. The journey up takes about 15 - 20 minutes and it is fabulous especially if you have a clear day with good visibility. We booked a ticket that involved a bus journey to Tai O the fishing village on stilts and a boat trip round the harbour and village. You must NOT come back down and then try to find the bus (our mistake!) you actually catch the bus at the top near the village. The trip to the village didn‚Äôt take long and the boat trip was only about 30 minutes but well worth doing. The bus then takes you back up to the Buddha and you return back down on the cable car. We made the mistake of coming back down, but then caught the Number 11 bus (for $11 each, so ¬£2.20 in total for a half hour bus ride). This took us to the village where we showed our tickets and got on the boat. Upon our return we found the bus going back up to the Buddha but the driver seemed reluctant to take us but I shrugged and pleaded and he let us get on fro free. We then got our second trip down from the Buddha by cable, great fun!! But the trip to the Buddha is well worth it. You can pay to go inside for an exhibition which includes a free vegetarian snack next to the temple, which again only cost about ¬£4 each and the snack was a plate of noodles with a choice of snack and a tinned soft drink. Good value!"
Tian Tan Buddha,Highly recommended.  Nice weather in October - not too hot.  Worth visiting if you have a day to spare when you are in HKSAR.
Busy but fun ,We hit the big Buddha the day of a trial race (which looked lots of fun). It was still a good day out and worth the trip. It‚Äôs a beautiful structure.
Nothing too special,Nothing special at all. We enjoyed it because we enjoyed the long tram ride from Subway station to the statue area which has a magnificent view.
Great Tourist Attraction,"One of the nices one day trip in HK, reasonable price and interesting. Combination of ferry and bus to get to the island."
Impressive Statue and Cable Car,"Wow! Is the first thing that springs to mind, the cable car is quite a long journey but I enjoyed every minute of it. We travelled to Lantau Island by the MTR and picked up the cable car from there. There are lots of shops once you get off the cable car and before you reach the Buddha. Be warned there are lots of steps to reach the Buddha statue, but well worth the climb.  Wear comfortable shoes because of all of the walking. Very impressive statue and nice story behind the making of it."
Amazing structure!,We took the cable car up and the bus via Tai O village on the way back to the station. It was very hot when we visited so we didn't do the climb to the top although I wish I would have done it now!
Fantastic views,200+ steps to the Buddha but the views at the top are beautiful. The tributes to departed loved ones are moving. It seems that the older bars/restaurants have been pushed out by the new village of shops etc at the top of the cable car which seems a shame. Overall a great afternoon.
Have lunch there!,"When visiting and if possible, go to the VIP restaurant which is not only very reasonable but also grant you entry to the inside of the Buddha. Why miss it while helping the monastery and having lunch ! (Knowing that you have 249 steps to digest your lunch too !)"
Impressive!,"Visited the Buddha on a week day and the crowds were not too bad.  The location is excellent, albeit the sun was right overhead at about 11:30, so not ideal lighting for photos -  nevertheless still worth the effort.  Some 250 steps to the top but it has to be done ....."
A must see! ,"Take the MTR then the cable car. A fantastic way to see Hong Kong. It‚Äôs a long walk (approx. 236 stairs) up to see the Buddha, but so very worth it."
Great Climb,This is a destination with all sorts of attractions at the Buddhist Monastery but the climb up to the Buddha is great
Beautiful!,"This place was one of my favourite parts of my trip to Hong Kong. We took the cable car up and the view was lovely. We climbed up the steps to the Buddha and there is a great view from the top. It is well worth a visit to the monastery too as it is very beautiful- especially the room of 10,000 Buddhas.The town at the top itself is very touristy, but there are good places to eat and drink, and very clean public toilets to use."
Good experience,"This is one of the most popular attractions of HK. Do take the cable car. You will enjoy the views. Strongly recommended to take glass bottom cars at least for one way. They are called crystal cars, I think."
Impressive,The 25 minute cable car trip up to the tourist village is impressive - even more so because of a glass floor to the cable car if you book a crystal trip.There are eateries and up market souvenir shops.The big guy is impressive - even if you're not up to the climb.Well wort a visit but choose a clear day if you can.
big is an understatement !,it should be called HUGE Buddha. Its amazing and well worth the trip out. Make sure to take the cable car as its spectacular.
Impressive,"Nice ride to get there, enjoy the trip with a cablecar (spectacular perspectives!) and explore the silence of Hong Kong."
WOW,"Came here on the train, then cable car up to the bug Buddha.It's a must whilst here in Hong Kong and not so far away.It's quite breathtaking looking up at this."
Cable Car Ride is a Plus,"The big buddha is just that - a big buddha. Once you get off the cable car, it is an easy walk up plus about 120 or more steps to climb. The views are nice. The museum offers a glimpse of the life history. The mosastery and building that houses a 1000 gold looking buddha is moderately interesting. The vegetarian fast food restaurant offers a variety of uninspiring but edible menu choices.Visit this place for the cable car ride. It is a long ride with multiple relay points. I think the cheaper car without the glass car is just as good as the one with the glass floor. The views are excellent."
Execllent day trip,"Take the MTR to Tung Shung, then the cable car. Choose a clear day if you can because the view from the cable car is fantastic! Buddha statue and temple are very impressive. The little ""town"" is very touristy but pleasant. Very nice contrast to HK city,"
Impressive shrine,"Site a bit commercialized, but beautiful , plenty of restaurants topick and choose your fancy, impressive views on your way up."
really enjoyed this,"Totally free when up via the cable car, very well done and well cared for, all clean and respectful.  cows roam free, u can light up sticks in memory of people past and present. Lots of steps to climb to get up to the Buddha but take your time and it‚Äôs so worth seeing."
AMAZING,"Fabulous trip to Lantau. I was on a pre booked trip and glad I did as think would have gone wrong alone...although others said was simple!!!Just to see this Budda is an eye opener, it is massive and stunning... a must see when in H.K. Definately not to be missed.If getting the cable car back down upgrade to a glass bottom one."
Outstanding worth going,Took the MTR and cable car to monetary and Tian tan Buddha. Took 45 mins from Kowloon MTR station. Worth it. Can skip cable car by taking local bus then longer time to get there. Truly a memorable site.
TTBing with my teen son,"Wow, our first encounter with the East, Asia, Buddha and it was terrific. Enjoyed the trip over, enjoyed the climb, walked inside. It would have been nice to have some English speaking guides to tell you the story and not have to google it all. Bought the tickets to go inside, and instead of ""free ice cream and water"" took the souvenir.On a hot day come prepared (shades, hat, plenty of water). The ""village"" from the s60 cable car to the TTB is more of a ""modern village"" with Starbucks (kinda spoils the day) and plenty of places to eat and get souvenirs (for those who must). Great visit.Yariv & Son"
Worth the travel from Central HK,"Almost delayed our trip, but glad we didn't. The cable car trip up is worth the visit alone - 25 mins of amazing views.  A further 10 minute walk is the Buddha - great place to take in the views and get a few photos.  Worth taking the time out to visit."
Well worth the journey,"You need to set aside at least half a day to do this place justice, but it is absolutely worth putting on your Hong Kong itinerary. It turned out to be one of the highlights of mine.If you're staying in Kowloon or Hong Kong Island, there's a bit of a journey on the MTR to get to the Ngong Ping terminal, but it is well worth it for the 360 cable car experience. We went first thing in the morning (fortunately on a clear day) so didn't have to queue long for tickets and only had to share with three others on the way to the Buddha, and had a whole carriage to ourselves on the way back. The cable car journey is fairly long (about 20 minutes) but when the weather is right you get a brilliant look at some truly gorgeous Hong Kong greenery, not to mention the airport. It's also quite special when the Buddha slowly appears in your view.Once you get out of the cable cars, you're in Ngong Ping village. It is clearly 'manufactured' and designed to be a tourist trap, but I quite liked it. It feels Disneyland-esque in part, but also quite authentically Chinese. It's hard to describe. Still, the various shops there are well worth a visit.Once you've made your way through the village, you're at the steps of both the Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. The Monastery is great but of course it's the Buddha that everyone's there to see. The steps really aren't bad at all, though for anyone concerned about their fitness levels, rest assured that there are plenty of levels for you to stop at every 13 steps or so. As impressive as the Buddha itself is, what no one mentions is the great view you get of the nearby monastery and surrounding area from the top. If you can ignore the hoards of fellow tourists, it's a great place for reflection. I'd love to go back again one day."
Nice,Really nice place with other things apart from the Big Buddha. We used the cable car here(the glass ones) lovely experience. Some places to eat and some temples too around. Amazing experience
Excellent trip,The big Buddha statue is the largest bronze statue in the world. 168 steps to reach it are worth the climb. Nearby temple as well as the local village and cable car ride make this a great tour.
Worth the trip I guess,"After visiting this tourist trap built in the 80‚Äôs I though to myself ‚Äúisn‚Äôt there older, more historic places to go? Did I not to my research?‚Äù  Getting to the top is a good bit of exercise, the highlight was really the glass bottom gondola ride to get there. In another life (and cooler temp) I would have considered the hiking path."
A positive experience,"One has seen the odd view of the Buddha from the cable car but of course one is still a long way away. One steps of the cable car and enters a village of many different shops and restaurants. The shops are classy and quite expensive but of course there are cheaper tasteful goods on sale too. In fact there was a seasonal sale on when we visited, some good bargains were purchased. There is a feeling of space as one walks towards the foot of the Buddha. The climb up the Buddha is 268 steps. When we walked up we noticed that one set of steps was in the sun and the other was in the shade. For obvious reasons we took the shady steps. Stop along the way to take in the ambiance, take photos and catch your breath. At the bottom of the steps along the way to the Buddha are smaller statues of the 12 Divine Generals. At the top around the Buddha are 6 statues of Bodahisattbas, 3 on each side. There are small shops inside under the Buddha selling quality related products. The views from the top are very good indeed on a clear day."
I had been waiting to get here,"The last time I was in Hong Kong was over a decade ago, and my then-teenage son didn't want to go.  So for me, the anticipation may have been higher.  I was super stoked to finally get there and took my time with everything.  Make sure to walk inside and look at the exhibits in there.  There is place to buy drinks in there as well."
Worth the Hike,we were fortunate the lines were nonexistent to take the tram to see the Big Buddha. Once we got there we walked through the shopping area and then climbed the steps. The trek was well worth the hike. The view was amazing! We had a lunch of steamed dumplings in one of the restaurants on the premises. The meal was great.
"Cable car trip with good views, then a very unusual place ","Asia seems to have quite a lot of cable car ski lifts where there will never be any snow.   They can transport you to the most other worldly locations. The view from the cable car are fairly good. My kids got just as much enjoyment from watching the plans take off from HK airport as anything else. When the Buddha comes into view, it looks fairly small. That‚Äôs because your still miles away. When you disembark there‚Äôs a fairly modern shopping district with a bloody Starbucks.   Once you clear this space, then there are wild cattle and buffalo.  Stray but peaceful dogs (absolutely to my cup of tea, but they weren‚Äôt aggressive).  Lots of tourists not quite sure what to do. At the steps, the only way is up.  268 steps later then you get to have a great 360 degree view of the area. Getting to and from the site is easy via the MTR line."
nice trip,"you can go by metro then enjoy a bus ride in between the mountains, the big Buddha is a huge statue on the top of the mountain, so it is a nice trip only if the weather is favorable, but if it suddenly turns into an outbreak of rain like what happened with me you'll just get soaked and messy."
First visit ever for trying the 360 cable car,"It‚Äôs a great trial to take the cable car because you can view the HK -Macau- Zhuhai new bridge from the bird eye angle . Secondly, Lantau Island has many unexplored tree over valley . You can also view from the top .  When arriving the 360 market there . Quite enough rest places to hang out . Famous Ex Hong Kong female singer Ms Anita Mui memorial tomb was there too ,You might need to ask where it was . When returning to the Tung Chung station , I highly recommend to take a 50 minutes bus which travel almost entire island . From which tourist can enjoy the Lantou old village and one mile long sandy beach"
Well worth a visit,"A nice relaxing cable car ride with some lovely views take you to the small village which has a lovely atmosphere but quite touristy. Head to the Buddha and then prepare to climb the steps. Well worth the effort. If you have the time walk the Wisdom Path when you get back down. Expect to spend a day here, but it will be a lovely day with spectacular views."
Beautiful & Majestic!,"I had seen photos before coming to Lantau, but the real thing took my breath away! So beautiful and majestic-looking! Almost feels magical!"
Beautiful Buddha,The big Buddha on Lantau Island is a lovely trip. Don‚Äôt be daunted by the stairs!  We did a private tour for the four of us and it was well  worth the time and money. Travel up by cable car learning the history of the area and traveling back down via bus. Terrific day!!
Nice place,Very nice place to visit. Aii area is pleasant and very nice. The Buddha is very much impressive and nice view.
Your hk trip isn't complete until you go,"I can't recommend this slice of culture enough. The Buddha and Monetary are a great place to emerse yourself in Buddhist customs.The village you arrive in is pretty touristy with wifi everywhere and even a 'Subway sandwich' place that sells beer.The walk up is high, but me with two extremely clicky knees got up in about 10mins. Its lovely from the top looking up at Buddha and his statue ladies with offerings and then down to the monastery and the South China Sea views. Going inside the Buddha is pretty amazing too, the plaques on the walls commemorating those who have passed is quite a site to see.If you've got the time, I highly recommend it. Next time round id take the cable car 360 both ways, not just in. The bus took forever!!"
Highlight of our trip,The whole experience from getting there to experiencing the actual buddha and lunch at the monastery...amazing!
A day with the Big Buddha,"This was a very welcome outing to escape the concrete jungle that is central Hong Kong (we stayed on Nathan Road in Kowloon). It was great to getaway to the island and enjoy some fresh air. The Buddha isn‚Äôt as big as I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be, but it was beautiful."
Beautiful setting,We had a great trip up to the buddha using the cable car. We were lucky that it was a bit quieter than normal (due to the unrest) but this was a great spectacle. The temples surrounding the buddha are also well worth a look.
Beautiful place,"Went there on my own and loved my visit a lot. The place is very beautiful and relaxing. I took the cable car from city gate outlet mall and walked then to the big Buddha. As I don't exercise, climbing the stairs was a bit of a challenge so don't forget to take small breaks every now and then. Going down was easier of course. I highly recommend this experience and I'll do it again one day."
Good day out,"Lots of fun taking the cable car up to see the Tian Tan Buddha. Not too crowded and great for photos, it‚Äôs nice to see the city from the top of the mountain. Not much to do around except some restaurants and shops."
Worth a trip to marvel in views,The vegetarian food was memorable eating at the Buddhist restaurant! The monument is stunning with rich history plus the views from the top are stunning! Enjoyed the cable car ride up to it as well!
Serene crystal cable car with a perfect destination ,"The combination of the crystal (glass floored) cable car with the short walk then steps up to the big Buddha was an excellent day out. There are plenty of restaurants there if you need food or a drink. This is one of the smoothest cable cars that you‚Äôll ride in, excellent turns and an amazing view of the busy airport Well worth a visit"
Make the trip,"First things first do not bus it to the big Buddha, sure you may have to wait a while but take the chair lift you will not regret it, start you trip to the big Buddha with a fantastic trip of around 25 mins each way on the chair lift the views are fantastic be sure to have a camera handy as the sites you see are something you don‚Äôt see travelling around other ways. Once off the chair lift you make your way through a small village offering other things to see and do you can get something to eat drink or shop on your way the the Buddha and what a Buddha this is the size is unbelievable but make sure you have a drink handy because if your going to the top it‚Äôs about 260 steps to to top so just take your time and head up the sites at the top are great well worth the effort and it is a lot easier on the way down."
Peace,It was a wonder place.. visit must will get peace. Lord Buddha will bless everyone. Want to go once again
Good day out,Caught the cable cart up to the mountain and a great walk up all the stairs to the top to see the Buddha
Fantastic views and so spiritual,"We visited Tian Tan Buddha when we were in Hong Kong in July.WE took the cable car up which has some amazing views although on the way up and down we did experience some wind and rain.Once at the top we walked up to the temple via the bars and restaurants where we had something to eat and drink first.After eating we decided to walk up to the Buddha and walked through the lower entrance and past all the statues and climbed the steps. The walk up can be a challenge for people with walking difficulties but there are places to stop on the way up, and indeed many stop and take photos.At the top you can walk around the outside of Big Buddha, the views from the top are amazing and on a clear day you can see for miles, while we were the clouds were coming in but it didn‚Äôt spoil our experience.You can go inside the Big Buddha, there is a cost but included in the cost is an ice cream which was lovely as it was fairly warm although the weather was closing in and we had rain during the day. After visiting the inside we walked back down and had something to drink and did some shopping before getting the cable car back down,We really enjoyed the whole experience, whilst walking around there was cattle walking around as well, they should be treated with respect and are sacred animals and free to roam."
Expensive gondola but worth the trip,Right beside the airport this is something that can be done on a short stop over or a long day waiting at the airport. The Gondola isn't particularly cheap but it is 6KM long! and has great views and well worth thrip rather than bus up.  The buddha itself is huge and there is a small town up there as well.
Buddha is BIG,"When in Hong Kong (HKG), the Big Buddha is a must see.We had a light breakfast in the morning and arrived at the ticket booth area around 10:30am.  The line was long, however, it does most quickly.The gondola ride to the top gives you a panoramic view of HKG - bonus.There are shops and restaurants around the upper complex.  The Buddha is amazing to see."
Big Budda with brother,Had a few hours to fill in while kids where at school. Was a cool trip line up at gondola was ok but we did arrive a little early. Gondola ride was nice. Nice little climb up the stairs to see the big budda. Also took a walk around the rest of the site quite interesting. Don‚Äôt expect to spend d more than a couple of hours there. Plenty of food options available if you need it and plenty of gift shops.
A perfect place to visit before flight,"We had an late flight out of Hong Kong, so we went there by bus and cable car. The cable car ride alone is an experiance, since you can choose to sit in a ""christal"" car. At Ngong ping I recommend to buy the ticket to go into the budda and have a nice look from the top. Then use the ticket to ge a tasty snack at the temple"
Good afternoon excursion,"Good for an afternoon excursion. Take the MTR to the end of the Ting Chung line,  then the cable cart up to the top of the mountain and then walk through the souvenir theme park (only negative) until you get to the Temples section. It is worth climbing the steps to see the Buda. On the way down visit the Temples and if you are lucky, enjoy the monks chanting during their prayers.If it is not too hot you can go for a walk all g the wisdom trail.Note: do not get scared looking at the maps on site... the scale is way off! Distances are much shorter than shown in the maps!"
Need to be fit,"It's a hell of a walk up those stairs to visit the Budha, nice village there, a bit expensive. Great photo opportunity"
Great day trip,Catch the cable car to the top.  I would advise taking the clear-bottom car if you can handle it as the view is much better.  I would also suggest to leave as early as you can in the day to beat the crowds.
A trip to big Buddha ,"While visiting Hong Kong a trip here was top of our to do list it was a wet day which made it more of a relaxed visit with not so many people around, we got the MTR to Tung Chung from Hong Kong main station which is the orange line,on arrival there is a cable car that goes from around the corner of Tung Chung MTR station which we had planned to take but because the weather it wasn‚Äôt running so we took a coach bus service up to the village where big Buddha is based which you can use your octopus card on. When you arrive at big Buddha there‚Äôs a fair few steps to the big Buddha itself and one outside it you can go in and have a look inside and for a fee climb up inside it which as part of the ticket included food at one of the outlets outside big Buddha. Great views from the top and the village it‚Äôs based at is very nice to visit also"
must do,"Lantau is best visited on an organised trip ,on your first visit,to get all the real history, and facts,eat with the monks visit the statue ride back on cable car.check out shopping outlet at the bottom, you may want more time,if so ditch your coach ,a taxi will not break the bank"
Fun,The air is comfortable to breathe however the trek on the path is very tiring. They sell gorgeous souvenirs too.
Cable car ride to the top,"Get cable car tickets in advance as they‚Äôll be cheaper, the hike up to the Buddha is not for the amateur. The Buddha and monastery are well worth the visit."
Wonderful spectacle,"If going to Hong Kong this place is a must to visit, together with the huge Buddha on Lantau  Island is the monastery, and of course the inevitable shops in the form of a very pleasant Village."
Good Day out from the City,"recommend the cable car ride into Lantau, great views of the Island and the attractions in the area like the gift shops are worth a visit"
Totally worth the drive up! ,While on a long stop at Hong Kong airport the Big Buddha was a perfect thing to see. Left airport on a cab and got there in 25 minutes and spent two hours touring this incredible site. Gotta climb stairs to reach the Buddha so wear comfortable shoes. Beautiful site as well as the monastery!
It's fine,The big buddah is fine but frankly not that interesting. The ride over on the cable car is great but the buddah is not terribly interesting to me. We took a few photos and then moved on to the next thing.
Great visit to Lantau,"Caught mtr and cable car to get to Buddha. Fabulous journey. Cable car very stable , despite wind , and have great views of Island and airport. Worth climbing to top"
Big Buddha,Cable car ride is amazing.  Loved the Buddha.  I went down to the fishing village and took a boat ride but didn't see any dolphins.
Checkbox kind of visit,"Good for Buddhist but I‚Äôm not so I came with friends just to tick an item out of the checklist of what to see in Hong Kong. It is a really big Buddha though, not usually seen elsewhere. There is also a Buddha temple 5 mins away from the big Buddha. We took the cable car to come and then went to the Tai O fisher‚Äôs village after that. Good package of things to do in a day."
Interesting attraction,"268 steps to reach the base, however well worth it, even if viewing from afar. Interesting museum also available to visit."
Gondola ride and Big Buddha ,"Took the metro to get there early but ended up waiting about an hour before the gondolas were operational! It was all worth it in the end. The gondola ride took about 30 minutes and the scenery was fantastic. The Big Buddha is very impressive even from ground level though the climb up those many, many steps is worth it. The Po Lin monastery is very beautiful. Ngong Ping village is very touristy but still worth a look around."
Amazing to see,we drove to the top and entered there we had a guide who gave us the choice of either walking down the stairs or driving back I chose the drive but my whole family walked it down and took fantastic pictures. It was really something we also ate at the monastery I think that's what it's called it was a vegetarian meal which was delicious.
The Gondola ride and the Buddha were both great.   ,"Easy to get out to the Gondola via the MTR.  The Gondola ride is about 30 minutes and every minute is enjoyable.  The actual Buddha is impressive and is worth the 450 steps up the hill.  Overall, a nice place to visit, however, do plan on 4 hours from Hong Kong island to visit given the MTR and Gondola time."
Must do!,We took the ferry from Hong Kong to Mui Wo and caught the bus there to the Big Buddha. Although the weather wasn't co-operating on our visit the statue was even more impressive in real life. Take time for a snack from the vegetarian cafe before heading down on the cable car.
Great day out!,"The cable car ride up is a great experience - we used Klook and saved 19% for a group of 5 people and were even given a glass floor car called ‚ÄòCrystal‚Äô, this gave great views of the jungle and footpaths below.  The buddha itself is placed above 16 sets of 16 stairs - a good workout."
One of the best Landmarks in HK.,"One of the best parts of visiting the Tian Tan Buddha is getting there in a cable car. The first sight of seeing the buddha's silhouette from the horizon as you approach sitting inside the cable car is just breathtaking.  Try to get there when they first open as it gets extremely busy by Lunchtime. The experience just isn't the same when the place is crowded.The Buddha is an HK landmark that you shouldn't miss, it's just a wonderful place to visit with the children and they also have lost of reasonably priced restaurants on site.  I really love the Tain Tan Buddha and would highly recommend it."
Impressive,Worth the climb upstairs to feel the immensity of the Big Buddha. Also at the top under his feet there's an exhibit of how he was built.
Beautiful Big Buddha,We arrived to the gondola at 3:30pm and paid for a standard return trip at the cost of HK$235 to go see the Big Buddha.  You can pay HK$55 more if you want a glass bottom gondola but don‚Äôt do it if you are afraid of heights. It was a perfect time as there was no queues (line ups) and we boarded a gondola immediately and had a private ride. The views from the gondola were spectacular and the ride itself took less than 30 minutes. You alight from the gondola to a quaint small village that I was so surprised to see feral cattle and buffalo wandering around! We arrived to the base of the Big Buddha and started to climb the stairs. Due to the heat and humidity we did have to stop twice on different landings to catch our breath as we climbed. The Big Buddha was amazing! The views amazing! It was so peaceful. Everywhere is the perfect spot to take photos however there are signs requesting no photos once you enter the Big Buddha itself. Leaving on the gondola I am glad we did not get the glass bottom gondola as the queue for it was long as for every 1 glass bottom gondola there are 5/6 standard ones so the standard line was minuscule. We had a 24hour layover and stayed at a local airport hotel and was so easy to get to. So worth visiting!
Hong Kong big Buddha (Tien Tan Buddha),"Great site seeing of Hong Kong. Tien Tan Buddha is a place u will not regret going to.. We took the cable kart up with was worth every cent, great views from high above. The other option you can take is by bus if u don't want to spend the dollars. The bus trip will take roughly 35mins however there is a lot of winding roads.. once you get to Tien Tan Buddha you will find it sits on top of the mountain. The walk up and down isn't as bad as it looks."
ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE THE CLIMB,"We visited the Big Buddha as part of a tour....personally we could have spent much more time than we had allocated here, at the Po Lin monastery and the quaint little touristry village that you pass through on the walk up to them....I'd recommend trying to make your way independently to this site & enjoy it's beauty & serenity at a more leisurely pace.We unfortunately didn't have enough time to make the climb up the 200 odd steps to the top of the Buddha but the view would have been awesome!"
Impressively large Buddha,"After riding on one of the worlds largest cable-cars arriving at this huge monument was a little anti-climatic. Sure it is imposing but having visited quite a few Buddhist temples around Asia I found it strangely lacking that aura one associates with the belief. Nevertheless, still definitely worth the long trip out from HK to Lantau island and I'd say it was a must-do place to visit."
Nice ride over lots of steps,Not a bad day out. Lots of stairs to get to the big Buddha. They will try make you pay at the bottom but just walk past as that‚Äôs for entry to museum.
Quick visit,"We got the cable car option to have glass bottom but did not choose this to be honest the views up and around are more exhilarating than below,  can hike around d if you wish. We choose to just look around at top and not go into this was free again beautiful views across to other islands,  brochure helpful in points of interest. Lots of lovely shops too on the way to buddha. Worth a visit.We dropped our bags in storage at airport then did this which took 20min to cable by bus from airport, then 25min cable each way and we had about 90min to look around. Manage it although longer would of been better but we had flight to catch to Seoul"
Good day out,"We travelled out by MTR to Tung Chung and walked the couple of minutes to the cable car for the ride up to the Big Buddha. We had been warned about long queues, so got there around 10 am when it opened, so only had to wait a few minutes. Enjoyed seeing the Buddha but the monastery is absolutely stunning and the Path of Wisdom walk also worth doing. On its own the Buddha is worth seeing, but the cable car, monastery and walk definitely made it more memorable."
Beautiful Buddha,I love the cable ride there. It was a hot day but cool and breezy in the cable car and scenic views. We enjoyed walking around the wisdom path. There‚Äôs special energy around this place üôè
Must See Place to Visit While in Hong Kong,"During my trip the cable car ride was down for maintenance so we took the MTR and bus to see the Buddha and we were not disappointed.  There is an indescribable beauty and peace that surrounds the area and be prepared for a nice workout if you decide to climb all 268 stairs to the top. The Po Lin Monastery was also out first encounter with the ""squat"" toilet, which is pretty much a hole and you need to bring your own toilet paper. There are several nice small shops around the area as well as other trails and parks to enjoy while on the island."
View of the Big Buddha.,"The 30 minute journey to get there by Cable Car is a great experience to start with.The view from the base of the 168 steps is magnificent.However, it is best take a bus to the top and look down for a great view too.If you have a tour guide, the information about the museum under the Buddha is interesting too.There are many gift shops with a good variety of items too.Well worth a visit."
Niew view of giant Buddha statue,Very nice to see this huge Buddha statue eventhough have to walk many stairs to arrive on the top. The scenery is very beautiful on the top. Enter the museum where there are various stories about buddhism.
Amazing,Tian Tan Buddha also known as the Big Buddha. It was an amazing ride to get to this place. You board a cable car which is a 25 to 30 minutes ride through the mountains. You can either take a normal cable car or a glass bottom one call crystal. Once you get there you have to walk to the top. I suggest you go there early to avoid crowd.
Very good,This is definitely worth a trip.  It is best to try to get there early as it gets busy. It is easily accessible using public transport then the cable car. The views from the cable car are amazing.
Amzing and mystical..............,"A highlight for me in Hong Kong, got the MTR and followed by the cable car up to the Big Buddha.Exceptional spot, great vibe and along with the monastery a great place to see.Plenty of steps to the top. Go early to avoid the crowds."
It is one of a kind! Beautiful settings and very peaceful.,"No doubt, memorable visit. Go early, it opens at 10, so it is more peaceful. We were lucky to be at the Monastery for a ceremony. The singing and music is overwhelming."
Wow what a site,Amazing Buddha.  As you are in the cable car as you get near this huge Buddha appears in the distance.  This is my second visit.  Worth the trip.  Be ready to climb around 300 steps when you arrive.  Dont miss on your next visit to Hong Kong
Wonderful Journey and Experience,"We had not booked in advance and were expecting long queues for the cable car especially as it was a Sunday. Nothing could have been further from the truth. We exited the MTR at Tung Chung station (only 10 HK Dollars each way concession-for over 65‚Äôs- from Olympic). Had breakfast at Urban snack bar then off to the cable car....no queues.....great. Wow, what a journey up and over the hills to the Buda. Once there, had drink in the village before heading to the Buda. So many steps to climb but boy, is it worth it when you reach the top. Thoroughly recommend this location."
Bus tour,This tour included vegetarian lunch. Very warmly received. The big buddha apptley named. Museum inside very interesting. Tour guide was excelent. Very informative. Plenty of time to look around. Took the chairlift back down. Wow what a long ride and beautiful view of hong kong.Recomend it
Plan Ahead,"Knew we wanted to visit but did not plan ahead!!!  Book tickets in advance so you can avoid the snaking lines of people.  Once you do make it up, the displays are interesting.  Well worth a day out from HK city."
A must do on your Hong Kong agenda,"Absolutely breathtaking.  You get up by cable car, the ones with the glass floor cost extra.  Once up there is a small village and a monastery and many gorgeous statues.  I was dreading the steps to the Big Buddha to be truthful it was not that bad at all.  It is spectacular and a must do."
Must do ,What a beautiful village and cable car that takes you there. The actual Buddha statue takes just over 200 steps up towards it but it‚Äôs easy to walk and every step offers incredible views. It is very chilled day out and away from hectic city. We took MTR and it was very easy to get to there.
A Must ,The best way up is with a cable cart The way up was breath taking and the seen out of this world The location is interesting and the monastery is one of a kindThe actual Buddha statue is on the top of the hill and the view from the terrace  where it stands is grate
A great time to relax and amazing view,This is a MUST DO if you have the time and weather permits. Make sure it is a clear day and you will experience the most amazing view on both ways - up and down. The Buddha and the village is very nice and the steps are something! Especially when it is hot. Make sure to ear comfortable shoes. But it is amazing.
Big buddha ,Super views if the weather good..lot of steps to climb but we'll worth it. ..bit touristy with all the he shops n souvenirs on sale
Wow,"Tranquil, beautiful and breathtaking,  I felt closer to my feelings and inner self.  A great way to see hkg from a height and wow is not enough.  12 years to build a beautiful sight.  Thank you"
important buddhist shrine worth the visit,this is a ride from Central. Worth it but be early as the lines can quickly become very long. tig Buddha is worth the trip- but to get the full impact be prepared to climb the many stairs to the top
Simply Amazing !,"The Buddha statue is truly a wonderful sight to see.  Pictures don't do it justice.  We took the bus up and the cable car down.  It was one of the most serene, inspiring and amazing sites to see.  It is a little bit away from Hong Kong proper, but worth the bus ride.  We had some rain and fog, but miraculously when we got to the site, everything opened up for our time there and even the cable car started working on the way down!  Truly breathtaking!"
Great spiritual and touristic site,"This is a great way to get out of Central Hong Kong for a day. You can access the site via ferry to Mui Wo and from there you can take the bus to Po Lin Monastery. The Buddha statue is impressive to look at. There is a 3D view of Lantau Island at the top of the stairs. Po Lin Monastery offers a variety of vegan food, which is delicious. Worth to visit!"
Buddhas statue,"Very enjoying cable car journey to Buddhas temple, statue and village. Calm, quite and peaceful atmosphere. Worth place to visit."
New experience with bus,"It not first time we go there but this time we take a bus from Tung Chung station to big Buddha ,,is new experience with Amazing view then we come back by boat"
Interesting,"It‚Äôs a nice place for a view of the Ocean. The cable car will also provide a fantastic view of the airport. It‚Äôs definitely a must go, but be prepared to sweat a lot during the summer. Budha stars are a killing one."
a must see while in HK.,"worth the visit, linked with the discovery of Tai O, fisherman's village reachable by bus, few miles away."
Too commercialised at the entrance,Very quiet day. Too many tacky food stands at the entrance which kind of spoils the image of a peaceful religious place. Worth the long climb up though.
Nice half day at Lantau Island,"We spend half day at Lantau Island. We used the cable car, which is beautiful and arrived at the top. There we started our walk to the Tian Tan Budha: nice impressive statue. We were not interested at the Monastery but went to the Wisdom Path, where there were very few people and very attractive walk with I highly recommend."
Trip to Lantau Island,"If in Hong Kong this is a must see, but make sure you go on a clear day as the views are breathtaking from the top, also beware to get to the Buddah you will need to climb 236 steps to get there."
Breath taking,Wonderful place to go with a guide as you learn all the history. Make sure to take umbrella and not good for anyone that has any difficulties walking
Nice visit,A nice way to spend a few hours via the cable car. The entrance is a bit Disneyland. Some nice places further back toward the monastery. Don't pay to go up to the Buddha. It's not required
A must do in Hong Kong if tune permits,"A bit on the out skirts and takes about 1 hr from the central station, the Buddha is a site to visit.You will have the views and enjoy the sky tram ride fora good 25 minutes.I took the crystal cabin on the sky train which I thought was not worth the 300 $ spend.Would advice you to take the regular one.The temple is really nice and you can spend an entire days picnic here.The food offered is vegan and really flavorfull with great prices.The structure itself is fabtastic. And inspiring"
Don't miss,"Beautiful place that is not be missed if in Hong Kong. Plan a day, as it takes about and hour and a half to get here. The views are stunning, the 20 minute gondola ride is fun, especially if you get a cabin with a transparent floor.  We loved it all, from climbing the steps to reach Buddha, to the charming town its located in, to the walking cows and bulls freely roaming the streets. Unforgettable."
A Great Way to Spend Half a Day: Cable Car to the Big Buddha,"We rode the glass-bottomed cable car to Lantau Island and then walked to find the Big Buddha - it is a fun half-day adventure. Once you make your way to the foot of the Big Buddha, there are lots of steps to climb closer to the top. But older people (or people in not great shape) can still enjoy the big Buddha - they just would not climb the steps. They will try to sell you tickets for VIP access to the inside of the Big Buddha base - we did not do this extra-fee access so I don't know what it is like. Our view and access was just fine - we saw what we wanted to see. This area can be quite foggy, so obviously the cable car ride and the Big Buddha are best when there is no (or minimal) fog."
Totally worth the day trip!,"As we were in Hong Kong only for 3 days, we were a little hesitant about spending a day in Lantau Island but it was totally worth it. We made reservations on the NP360 Cable Car  (reservations open 2 weeks prior I believe) and that ride itself was completely worth the stunning views. Once we got to the island, it was a short walk, and a bit of a climb to the Buddha. But the views were again something else. Lantau Island is covered by green covered hills and the fog that keeps rolling in and out from the bay just makes it much more beautiful. As this is now a major tourist attraction there a lot of places to eat and shop and once can easily spend 5-6 hrs here."
Watch the weather,"Visited in August and came early (I was basically the first one there). Unfortunately the Buddha was covered in fog, which became worse as time went by.The cable car ride down was even worse as I couldn't even see 10 meters down (glad I didnt pay extra for the 'glass bottom').The Buddha is very touristy with a 'tourist village' (consisting of souvenir shop and restaurants) next to it. Kind of takes away from the atmosphere if you ask me."
Worth Your Time to Visit,"We took the gondola to see the Big Buddha and it was a great way to spend the afternoon.  When you get off the gondola, it does feel like a tourist trap, with lots of shops and restaurants and even a 7 Eleven.  After you walk past that area, the grounds are beautiful and the views are spectacular.  There is a fair amount of walking involved."
Bi budda,Long travel on gondola but it has to be done as it is famous to see in Hong Kong. It‚Äôs also quite a long way from central Hong Kong. It takes about 45mins on mtr train. Then you have to queue for tickets which took another 1hr.
Well worth visiting ,We decided to visit this site due to the cable car ride which gives you amazing views of Hongkong. It is well worth visiting and I loved seeing the cows wandering in and out of the street.
A must see in HK,"Be ready to walk up a lot of stairs but it's worth the burn! The Big Buddha is awesome, from your trip to it all the way up it is amazing . I have been up there a few times and I will be back.."
Harmonious place : To do absolutely,"If you go to Hong Kong, you have to go there. You'll understand. Nice temple, everything is unique and on top of that there is a nice panorama when arriving at the big Buddha."
Big Buddha,Very nice cable car ride to the top. Lots of steps to get up to the actual statue but you can get a good view from the bottom of the stairs.
"do visit, not overwhelming","yes, it is large, yes it is worth visiting, but not that overwhelmingly memorable - especially on a cloudy day when you may hardly be able to see it!  But do visit places, e.g. fishing villages in the local area"
A must do,Must check the web cam to ensure the sight is not fogged out or you will be disappointed. The cable car ride to the just awesome. Besides visiting the Buddha must visit the monastery.
"Absolutely wonderful, a MUST do in Hong Kong","Absolutely loved this attraction, highly recommend as a MUST do in Hong Kong. Definitely worth paying the money to catch the cable car (about $44 return each per adult), when the mountains pass and the statue of Big Buddha comes into view, it is wonderful. The little village is beautiful (even thought it is just shops, they are really nice shops). Visiting also the monastery that is opposite the Big Buddha is 100% a must also, the architecture is beautiful, the hall of 1000 buddha's is a sight to behold. Climbing the stairs to the Big Buddha statue is well worth is (there are over 200) but easy to do slowly, there is a plateau to rest every 20 or so steps. If it is a hot day when you go, there is a space under the statue to cool down when you reach the top."
Need to see it to understand 'BIG',"Lantau Island, great little escape from the hussle and bussle of Hong Kong, here you'll find the 'Big  Budda', make sure you're fit, there are over 250 steps to get up there, great photos and views."
See this Buddha,Great visit and learned a lot about buddism. Did the tour and had a pleasant talk with the monks. They guided me in their rituals and are always happy with a donation!
Worth both the time and effort...,"Advise cable car ascent and bus down to fisherman's village after spending a couple of hours exploring both temple and Buddha... Wander around, talk to strangers, light incense and say a prayer if you are so inclined... Marvel at the abundance of dragonfly elegantly negotiating both garden and visitors ... Allow yourself to stand in awe of this amazing Buddha and be intoxicated by the deafening silence...Seek out the Triple Lanterns cafe in the fisherman's village to cap off a wonderful day and put things in to perspective a little..."
"Big Buddha, o.k., if skies are clear.","While this is a recommended ""must see"" it isn't very old and is a bit of a tourist trap with souvenir shops and restaurants. It is a sight, but only if the clouds aren't too low. We lucked out the day we went. We arrived just before 5 p.m. and could see the statue as we approached in the cable car. When we left, shortly after 6, you could no longer see the Buddha. There isn't a lot to do or see although the view from the cable car is spectacular and you can see parts of the trail - stone and board, up to the top."
majestic view,This creates a new horizon in Lantau Island. The scenic location creates a solemn vibe and it should be really on anyone's travel list for Hong Kong.
BEAUTIFUL VIEW,"The Big Buddha is on Lantau Island so the views from the top are amazing. You can see for miles on a good day, the Buddha really reflects the culture. A must for tourists"
A great spot to relax after all the busy city,"Great spot for half a day trip to take rest from busy Hong Kong.You start with a great cable car trip, with option of crystal cabin with glass floor.After 25 minutes you rach final station and through nice village with high quality souvenirs shops you reach path of wisdom, a stairs to huge Buddha statue. After visiting statue you have an option to have a veggie lunch in monastery, very tasteful and reasonably priced. The monastery itself is also a nice spot to calm down in clean and calm surroundings."
A peaceful visit,Located at Lantau Island and located near to the airport. Had to climb apporximately 200 steps and view was amazing. It was a serene experience.Definitely a place worthy of a visit duing Hong Kong visit.
