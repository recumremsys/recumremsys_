Just one of many historical sites that makes an attractive backdrop for this town,"Side was clearly an influential port to the ancient Romans, & evidence of their history here can be found all around the town. It does make an attractive backdrop to the town"
Takne by surprise,"We were strolling through the old town and when we turned a corner we came across this site, a very pleasant surprise"
So romantic,"Lovely to explore, the Temple is extremely well preserved. It is a stunning location to watch the sun set.  Whilst we were there we saw a bride and groom having their wedding photos taken‚ù§"
Sightseeing ,"Lovely place must of been something amazing in its time , setting is an absolute must as is all of side to be fair the amount of Roman ruins is amazing especially at night look fantastic all lit up would recommend and return ."
A wonderful sight to behold!,"What a lovely surprise this was, within 15 minutes walking from our hotel, too. I could not believe that on the doorstep of where we stayed was this lovely monument and all of the associated ruins nearby, which were quite the spectacle. A real treat!! Just be aware that there are people around who will give you a guided tour for a fee, but without you knowing this in advance!"
Holiday ,Went to see the ruins. Loved them. It was a long walk for us. But we didn't mind. We enjoyed walking. Had to have photos taken
Apollo Heaven,Cannot believe you are allowed to get up close & personal with these fantastic pieces of historical importance. I absolutely love meandering through & touching the architecture of the past! Daytime or Night time adjacent to the beach you can imagine the photography available.
Nice trip from hotel ,"Visited during our stay in side,  only a short journey by dolmus. Hardly anyone around due to lack of tourists. It was hot so take plenty of water with you."
Must see,"The ruins coupled with shopping and great restaurants is a must, boat trips from the harbour can be booked by the hour."
Worth a visit,"Amazing to see historical monuments still standing after 2000 years bring some water it gets extremely hot up there, the walk along the way is so prettyüòç"
Beautiful place,"Side- small city and Roman temple near by the sea. Wear comfortable shoes , lots of walk, nice place to take photos."
It's a temple,"The whole of Side seems to be built in to, on, and around the ruins. Apollos temple sits proudly just off the harbour. Interesting monument and very photogenic"
Amazing,What an experience this little town is a must see....great little town that I highly recommend visiting
Must Visit ,This is a few minutes walk away from most of the rest of the ancient city but well worth a visit. Stunning during the daytime and outdoors means an easy location with COVID in mind. Red lines in the brickwork show where it's being restored. Went twice during the daytime - once was kinda busy but plenty of space and could still get some great photos. The other time there were only a couple of people there.
Lovely,As everyone says the time to visit is at sunset unfortunately everyone knows that so is very very busy. However at most times the area is not busy due to the current difficulties. It's loverly
So lovely,The sunset made this look even more beautiful. There were lots of wedding couples taking their photos here.
Beautiful sunset scene,Although busy it‚Äôs definitely a must. Go at twilight when it‚Äôs all lit up. It‚Äôs really stunning and great for photos
Harbour then walk,Quick look after a meal at harbour.Beautifully kept ruins and a walkway with ruins under glass pavement.
Sunset wow,What a great view for the sunset although a lot of people do go and then once the sun is down a visit to old town is superb with some superb restaurants personally found GUL the best
A lot to see and free,"Great place to visit. Lots Of history to see and spread out over a large area. Bars , shops and restaurants nearby so plenty to do."
Gorgeous Location,"Visited Side on a sunday, lovely and quiet, beautiful ruins, the scenery was pretty, shops and bars weren't busy and the locals were friendly. Definitely somewhere to visit when in the area, there is a tour guide in the bars as you walk along the beach just past the ruins offering great tours by local companies and at cheap prices, we went diving with Silver Scuba Diving and couldn't fault the day."
Great Location,By the harbour overlooking the sea. Must have been wonderful in all original glory. Do not miss the view.
Lovely,"Lovely just to walk around and see all the ancient site. It is near the harbour, so you can stop for a coffee and continue on. Most of the site is free."
Old town Apollo ,"It‚Äôs lovely around Apollo temple right in sea side.History just there but, need more attention to what is left In that old town... I believe more history to find out... authorities should do more about it."
Beautiful in the sunset,"This place is just magnificent, visited here at sunset and during the day, and its a splendid (and free) site. Highly recommend looking round old town Side, some of the restoration work is amazing including glass protection over the old ruins. Highly recommend seeing this and all the landmarks in and around Side. My teenage daughters and 6 year old son were in awe! (As were we!)"
Stunning ,Takes your breathe away every time either day or night. Best time as the Sun is setting as it casts shadows of the past.
Historical landmarks,Some great historical landmarks available to see. The temple of Apollo was very easily accessible and there were good historic descriptions  in multiple languages for people to read.
Beautiful when lit up,"We were in the area anyway and so went along to see the ruins, which were interesting and looked impressive when all lit up. Not sure it's worth making a special trip for however, as not much else there."
Basic...,"It‚Äôs a beautiful temple and impressive ruins but that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs in an area that isn‚Äôt looked after at all. The temple had been restored badly and the rest of the area is just open with ancient rocks strewn everywhere. There‚Äôs no information available, no staff and it‚Äôs absolutely strew with litter. It looks great at night all lit up but the hundreds of people taking selfies with it make it hard to appreciate. Make sure you set a side a good 5 minutes to visit."
Simply breathtaking ,I neurotoxin sorted to behold both in the daytime and at night when it is all lit. Simply a short walk into side old town and along the harbour front.
Nothing to see,Ruins... Not much to see except few stones. Expected much more according to previous reviews... Bit dissapointed.
Beautiful area,Went there last Wednesday by ‚Ç¨1 bus ride around lunch time on way to get a boat ride....boiling hot but very beautiful.
Bricks,Once you have seen it you have seen it not much to look at  waste of a bus ride and money nothing more to say
antike side,"lovely sunsets here, there is so much history in side so much to see and learn. i have been to pompei and found side easily rivals there and not so many crowds. you must visit all off antike side if you get the chance so much to see. thoroughly enjoyed my time wandering around."
Amazing!,Totally free! I think you only have to pay to go in the amphitheatre but it was closed when we went.
We had this view from our apartment window <3   STUNNING,"The history in this BEAUTIFUL town is staggering.. this beautiful structure is just as amazing up close as in the pictures, we were lucky to stay in an apartment where this was the actual view. It never failed to capture my attention at different times of the day and night, I took loads of pictures.. such a beautiful place.."
Stunning !,Go in the evening for an amazing experience transporting you back in time! A beautiful bride was there having her wedding pics done too üòä
A lovely walk from Side promenade ,Just a nice coastal walk from Side nice place cafes restaurants to relax. very hot take water good shoes.
Holiday,"The remains are a must and the glass floor so you can see from above the underground remains! We visited Side last June an we visited the Temple a few times. It's a very busy place an best time to go would be day an by night it becomes really busy but definitely a must go to if your visitors to Side Turkey ,‚ù§Ô∏è"
Awe inspiring,We visited the apollo ruins and the Aspendos. It was truly magnificent to see. Beautifully maintained and well looked after.
Lots to look at,We went to side turkey march 10 stay at side su hotel .the temple of apollo is  20 min walk  along the prom. It is on a very large site  you need trainers as is very rocky.also on site ampitherter  architecture  and coloms
"Once again a great 2 weeks holiday at the, Commodore","Had 2 lovely weeks at this hotel and will be going back again later this year if possible. The staff are very helpful and friendly, good food with plenty of choice."
Great History and Heritage,Very beautiful and exotic place.Good faciliated for tourists and great shopping possibilites for tourists.
Beautiful visit,Visited with family such a nice and relaxing place and great for photos. Is just pass the shops and harbour and no charge to enter. An impressive part of architecture and history accessible to all.
Manoj sharma at Side Antalya ,Amazing experience andceasy access to the old town and amphitheatre. Can easily access via local bus outside the hotel. 7TKL. About 1pound. Cheaper than JET2 price. You can access all the surrounding area via local bus/ taxi service. It's cheaper and safe. Don't waste money via jet2 rep or TUI rep. The choice is yours!
It's Just Six Pillars...,"6 pillars and that is all.1. Nothing special if you really want to look for something more unique.2. It is not really that well perserved.3. Too overated and over-reviewed for a deteriorating building with only 6 pillars4. Don't visit it when it is raining, it makes your mood worse."
Magnificent ruins,"The old part of Side is just that, there are Roman avenues, an amphitheatre, remnants of villas, shops temples and more.  The bus terminates at the top of this site where there are some toilets, these are clean and cost 3 lr or 50 cent euro. There is also a museum (18 lr) which is well worth a visit. The ruins are all accessible on foot, however, the terrain is uneven. There are boards up every so often explaining what you're looking at. While walking about don't get fooled by someone saying they are an archaeological guide, they are con men who after a while demand money from you (200) lr just for telling you what it says on the boards. Don't be put off visiting because of this just ignore them, as it truly is a wonderful place to visit."
History,Best place to visit if u r in history But make sure u visit in summer as its freezing in January when we visited little bit expensive but all worth it
Beautiful Ruins (July 2019),The Temple Of Apollo is absolutely worth stopping for when visiting Old Town Side. It is a beautiful example of Ancient Greek architecture.
Scenic view,Very scenic view of the temple ruins. Perfect photo spot. Just stroll around and snap some pictures.
beautiful location,"Perfect for sunsets and sunrises the temple has a backdrop of sun sea and sky.  Beautiful location, close to the harbour at the end of the historic peninsula. Many other fantastic ruins/sites nearby as well as the beach. The marina is lined with cafes and restaurants so this is a great place to relax after having explored the ancient sites"
Wow,"The Roman ruins are all open plan and free to visit. Amazing to see,  and all within walking distance of each other."
Romantic Setting,"Situated at the Marina with beautiful sea views and lots of bars and restaurants, the Temple of Apollo is a lovely place to stop and take a photo or 10 day or night. Eat at Ocakbasi restaurant whilst you are there. (Thanks me later)"
Amazing History,"A must see, steeped in history.  Near the harbour which is also very beautiful.  Just a stroll along the promenade."
Good ,Lovely to stumble into these old structures whilst walking along the coastline many more not far from this
Breathtaking,"You cannot go into Side, without having a look at the Temple of Apollo.It's truly a sight to behold."
Temple of Apollo,Great ruins some good information about ancient side lovely to see all the excavations and repair of these old buildings
Magnificent Monument,"The four pillars do look overbearing and stand out; it's amazing how the architecture has remained intact for so many years.  It's on the side of the sea, which makes it even beautiful- definitely worth a visit and looks lovely on the pictures."
Must see!,Beautiful scene set against a beautiful backdrop of the sea. Worth the drive in and the walk in. Can get rather warm even in November.
temple of Apollo not to be missed late afternoon or early morning  less people,stunning  its been rebuilt in places but you still get an idea of the grand splendour of the site . fantastic photo oppotunity  bus station near by and its worth taking a stroll down into old side harbour
Ruins on the sea front,Lovely to stroll ruins on the sea front.Temple of Appollo close to the Harbour and centre of the very attractive Side.
Fascinating sights,Absolutely brilliant scenery near the town of Side. Ruins can also be viewed through glass floors in the streets.
Loved Old Town Side,"The entire area of Old Town Side was beautiful.  From the minute you step through Vespasian Gate, to walking on to the quaint little streets lined with shops and restaurants to the history that is oozing from this area, I enjoyed every minute.  The Temple of Apollo was beautiful, as were all the ruins around. A definite must see."
1st visit,Just amazing and is left untouched for you to wonder around. if you just follow the prom to the end beyond the small marina you will find it
Stunning Side Old Town,"Enjoyed our visit very much, went back for more. Old Town is lovingly preserved, a spectacular compilation of old and new. A must see!"
Nice photo opportunity ,Lovely area by the sea hopefully they will restore more add more information about the ruins. Maybe some seating areas
Magnificent,After walking around all the ruins the temple of Apollo was the icing on the cake.  The area is still being restored so would love to go back and she it all again once completed
Old town,"Absolutely stunning, you have to visit. In the old town of Side the detail is amazing. The town itself is lime a picture postcard with immaculate paved streets, scenery which is out of this world."
Amazing,"We were fascinated by the view, the monuments and the culture.  A unique place with a strong spirit and emotion."
Beautiful,"Visited this both in daylight and at  night and  it was gorgeous. Lit up at night maybe gave it the edge, very impressive"
Great,Loved visiting the remains of the temples. Also nice to see they are keeping these and not just destroying the remains. A wonderful sight. The old village of Side was picturesque with the harbour and local shops. Well worth a visit.
Fantastic.,"Very impressive structure right by the sea. Well worth a visit loads of ancient stone work all around, fascinating to think how these were fashioned and erected so long ago."
Amazing,"This is a wonderful  monument near the seafront in the old town of Side,Looks lovely by day but absolutely stunning at night time."
Nice for photo opportunities ,Nice area of side for photos and to see the historic sites of the town. Not much else to say really.
An impressive monument,overlooking the sea it's an impressive site with lots of ancient stone work surrounding it worth a visit.
Totally unexpected,A walk down towards the Old Town and via these ample and magnificent part of Turkish History is a must.....You could mistake yourself for walking in Rome.
Apollo ,Great place with history.great sunset and some great boat restaurants.small village with beach hotels.nice shopping street next door.
Disapointing ,Not much to see. Didn't go at night when it's lite up. What you see in photos is about it. Much of it seems to have been taken away. In a bar next there are columns made into tables
Really pretty of a night ,"Really pretty of a night, ensure you wear comfy shoes as ground is uneven and dusty. Also a lot of mosquito‚Äôs here ensure you use spray or a band! Gets a bit busy but is Defiantly worth going to see!"
Ruin of a Temple,The ruin of the Temple is near the harbor. If you want to take a picture you have to rise very early or accept that other visitors are in your view.
A bit of history ,Great architecture - well maintained and looks really cool - oneOf the best attractions in Side. Obviously a must see when in this little town.
Impressive on a clear night,This is one of those 'must-see' sights which of course is free of charge. Dating back to biblical times the remains of this Temple provide an insight into the grandeur of that bygoing era.It is very impressive during the day but is a must-see on a clear night at sunset.It is easy to see why wedding brides seem to flock here for photos at the edge of the sea.
Ruins,Absolutely breath taking. Amazing at night when it's all lit up. Very very expensive to eat and drink in the old town and harbour
impressive roman site,In the centre of Side one can wander through these impressive Roman remains..It is close to the ancient Roman harbour.
Lovely for photos and history,Went here several times when visiting side. Beautiful setting with a lot of history. Excellent for photos in the day and night.
Great place,"Worth visiting, very nice view of the sea, lots of nice cafes nearby, good place to take photos, no entrance fee"
Awesome,"A must to see, fantastic , great scenery and so, so much history.  Great photo opportunities ,  awesome"
Glad I seen it years ago.,"I'm so glad I saw the Temple of Apollo years ago, on previous visits to Side;  when I was able to walk. Unfortunately I am in a wheelchair now and unable to access the grounds. Side is under major renovation, so wheelchair access should be considered for disabled people to see the historic sights."
Don't visit,"The temple is uninteresting and the Old Town of Side is best avoided entirely.  The town is horrible 1970's buildings, tacky stores selling fake YSL bags, Nike shirts etc and crooked shops keepers happily overcharging tourists.  Don't go there even if you are staying in a nearby hotel"
Under construction?,"It is one of the highlights in Side, Turkey.  They are currently restoring the temple.  You can also work in and around it"
Well preserved,"A well preserved archaeological site, with unlimited access, and a good photographical point. Worthy of a visit."
Great experience ,"It is great to see how much effort has been put into restoration. Well worth a visit. There has been some very welcome improvements to the shops close by, the glass floors are innovative and add to the atmosphere of the area."
Worth visiting,Well worth visiting if you're in the area. It's a nice walk along the shore from our Hotel (Acanthus) which lead to here just outside the shopping area.
Amazing ,"Spectacular piece of architecture free to visit, especially beautiful at night when lit up . Just in the old town of Side well signposted , just by the harbour beautiful scenery around temple of apollo and quaint little shops ."
Right on our doorstep,"Beautiful ruins just a few minutes walk from our hotel, lovely to see it during the day and lit up at night."
Stunning,"Stunning Roman monument and FREE. You can take a nice pic from this view with the sea in the back ground, but you need to be quick if you want a pic with no one in the back ground"
After sunset cruise ,Have visited Side at daytime and night so obviously visited the Temple of Apollo. Also both times from land & sea so from all angles & distances. If you are on a tight budget the Temple is free & the boat trips quite cheap. It is a stunning monument & although some pieces have obviously fallen over the centuries they are nearby so you can see the detailed carving on them too. At night it is lit up and makes it all the more mysterious and atmospheric
Unbelievable place!,"Went there with my mum and my wife. It pored down all day but what a day. The people there can't do enough for you, nice food, cheep beer and a good laugh with the German guy and a cockney bolke. Happy days."
Great day,I visited Old Side Town to do a bit of sightseeing. It was very impressive.Lots of ruins a lovely beach and many tourist shops bars and restaurants to visit near by.Worth a visit
Ancient ruins that are still being built ?,"The ancient Roman ruins are a must see , not just the Temple of Apollo but many other areas all around Side in Turkey . There is a lot to see and some bits are intact but they are being worked on everyday and being added to by today's workmen . Some of the repairs in some areas are very poor . Just look at the poor rendering done to the columns of the temple . It is a must see but much of it are just solid walls of mixed old and new stone ."
Lovely evening,We had a really lovely evening walking around the ruins .and got some great pics . It's better at night as all lit up looks really  impressive
Apollo temple,"Not as big as I thought it would be, but nice to see the history, parts are all over the site which it looks like they are trying to rebuild some parts."
Amazing old city,"The temple itself is nothing special. if you expect to see ""in a good condition"" temple, you will be disappointed. But the old part of the ancient city is great. Some buildings were reconsteucted a bit, some is just ruin, but I guess all people who like history will be the same amazed as me."
"Beautiful history, worth the walk!",Lovely bit of history to see. Very busy at night but that's because it's not as hot as in the day. Visited both in the day and at night. It is at the bottom of the old town next to the harbour so you can see them all in one day. People tend to get their photo with it and then leave.
Dee + Paul - Blackpool ,"Simply wow !  So beautiful and a definite must see along with the other ruins that are close by in Side , which by the way is a lovely little town ."
Amazing in the dark too ,We walked here in the day and in the evening it was amazing in both. NotToo many people and free to look around
Beautiful place,"Beautiful place to stroll, especially at nightfall. The lighting creates a nice, romantic atmosphere."
NIce,"Dramatic Roman architecture, looks even more spectacular lit up at night. Some nice bars and restaurants close by"
Nice Area,The temple is just a short walk from Side old town and it‚Äôs free to wander around there‚Äôs not that much to see so about 30 minutes will do you but there are some good photo opportunities.
Amazing,Side was totally amazing with the Temple of Apollo right in the centre of old town. This is a unesco protected worth a visit.
Temple of Apollo - nice but heart breaking,"Really nice , but what was heart breaking is that the ruins are not protected , they made houses , restaurants with the marble blocks from the temple ( something usual in Turkey ). It is nice , really worth seeing while still exists"
Needs protecting ,A very beautiful historical place however I think in the future the Turkish may regret allowing people to trample all over it! Worth a visit.
Good ,"Nice walk round Side Town leads you to this, The  Temple of Apollo, this is open and free to take a look around and is great to see, local bars nearby  and shops, well worth a visit"
Good temple location,"Even though the remain is just column but the location makes this temple remain is recommended for a visit in Antalya region. With background of Mediterranean sea, Apollo temple makes a good spot for photo session. The surrounding village of Side is also nice to stroll around. To reach this place you have to walk past through the village which full of restaurant, cafes, and souvenir shops.Date of experience: June 2019"
Awesome,"Visited at night awesome place, spent time looking all over the site, lot of different things to see , definitely going back for a day time look around"
History,Nice place to go and see a bit of  historic architecture and to try and understand how they did managed to build it a tour guide recommended
We went to Manaugat by local bus it stopped 1/2 a mile from the shops. you walked past the ruins an amphitheatre,"We booked 3 trips with a man from Bluemania, 2 trips out of 2 were disappointing, the 2nd he didn't turn up in a taxi booked and tried to say it was an hour later. we tried to cancel the 3rd and lost ¬£70, he wouldn't give us our money back, with more than 36 hours notice."
Beautiful,This is beautiful to look at but there are parts of it that are like a construction site which i think detracts from the beauty.
Beautiful and well preserved. ,Didn‚Äôt realise they close within 30mins patter arriving. The people at the entrance could‚Äôve advised us or not charged us for entrance. After entering within 30 mins was called to leave which I was fuming but couldn‚Äôt do much as to leave but the overall sight and scenery was breathtaking. Had a short stroll around the area.
A great photo opportunity,The Temple of Apollo is a great photo opportunity and a must place to watch the sunset. You won't be alone but what do you expect.
Must see in Side old town,"We went both i day time to see the ruins, few minutes walk from our hotel since we lived in Side Old Town. Later that week we also went there in the evening.In day time you get to see the ruins clearly and the blue sea, and in the late evening, the lights makes it very beautiful."
It's a must,Breath taking not far from hotel but we took taxi what cost 30 Lira well worth it as you have the harbour and plenty of shops selling every thing you can think off. Just go careful if u've never been here before as the try and con you. Lucky I've been to Turkey many times and 1 shop said they wanted 467 Lira in our money around about 68 pounds for a unbranded watch what was basically tack. So go very careful. But very picturesque
Quick visit,Nice to visit as we were passing. You can take some good pics.If you are staying near Side worth a visit
Perfect postcard picture,"We went to Side for the day whilst staying in Antalya.  The temple of Apollo standing by the sea was beautiful and looks like a postcard.  If visiting the ancient city this would be a 5 minute stop.  It is a little rough underfoot so may be awkward for people with walking difficulties.The temple of Athena is next door, again  this has been well reconstructed."
so interesting,we were awestruck when we saw the ruins of the roman cityand wondered why we had never read about them it so interesting you could walk round all day to think they have been around thousands of years
Very interesting,"We visited after going to the nearby Saturday market and it was lovely to see the old ruins, in places you actually walk over glass floors so you can see some ruins underneath you that have been left in situ for you too see, like others have said you do get hounded by the shopkeepers wanting you to go in to they‚Äôre shops which more people would do if you were left alone, many places selling food and drinks at reasonable prices.Go visit if you can"
Temple,This was stunning at night and only a taxi ride away from the hotel hermera. We walked along the promenade which took about 30 minutes but go early in the morning as it gets very hot as the day goes on
Amazing picture setting ,"Great place to visit and to get pictures. Theres also a museum nearby. If you follow the road to the little port you can get 1 hour ride along the shoreline for only 3 EUR, believe me you will enjoy it)"
Lovely but annoying,"Very nice to visit  but spoilt by to much hassle from Traders to get you to buy, It can get very annoying,If they were to hold off and let you look at your leisure it may be in there best interest,"
What a find,"Went to old town shopping ., and just walked to the other side and found this it was beautiful fair play we didn‚Äôt no it was there .. it‚Äôs on the sea front, with some  Beautiful restaurants ..it was our second time there as lots of shops bar and restaurants everywhere"
Stunning,Side is wonderful full of the hustle and bustle of Turkey then turn a corner and you see this amazing piece of history. Just wow
Very nice,Go there but not with your car. Take a taxi. In the evening there are some many people so you can feel suffocated.
Lovely place,"Definitely worth a visit, lot's of interesting things to see with some great history.. the only regret I have is not going back in the evening as I'm led to believe it is even more beautiful lit up..."
Life affirming and educational,"Full disclosure - I love Turkey so could be accused of being biased but the Temple of Apollo, Side itself and the area around the amphitheatre are a wonderful place to be. For one week my morning run concluded in the ruins. Often I was the only person around so I immersed myself in the thoughts of what this place would have been like 2k years ago. You can walk on the ancient roads, imagine the busy shopping area and even see where the toilets would have been that serviced the amphitheatre. There are a few information boards scattered around and your imagination can do the rest. The old stay dog wanders around but I was never bothered by them. If you are in one of the hotels nearby I thoroughly recommend coming here."
Temple of Apollo ,Absolutely love visiting this place when I go to turkey.. 2nd time visiting turkey. I'd like to visit in the sunset
Amazing‚ù£Ô∏è,"this place is exciting My advice to you, you have to go there with sunset, One of the most beautiful places you can see in side.."
"Ancient, Huge, Facing out to sea","We only managed to visit at night, but this ancient ruin - the Temple of Apollo, is well lit and freely accessible at the end of Side harbour. After eating at one of the nearby Restaurants (Liman or Aphrodite) its good to stroll to the end of he harbour and take in the view of the Temple, which is dominated by the Huge remaining doorway structure, as can be seen in the photos.Side is literally littered with Ancient Roman ruins, this is a famous one and well visited even at night."
Time well spent,"A fantastic combination to feel and learn a bit of history and enjoy the amazing photo opportunity. In between the sea and the harbor, the walk towards it is a pure pleasure. Do not mind the shops on the way as they are overpriced and money-oriented. Just enjoy the scenery and these amazing accomplishments of human civilization. It is even more fascinating at night"
love this type of stuff,"side is full of old ruins and I like the way the old town is done - the temple of Apollo is lit up  at night and great for holiday snaps -  I love history, Cleopatra , marc Anthony, Alexander the great all spent time here.  If you are like me and can use a bit of imagination what more do you need."
Something to do,Ok for a walk great view of harbour surrounded by shops .. and shop owners always in your face and the pressure to buy very off putting but the apollo very nice
Spectacular ,This is worth going to see when in Side if only to admire the accomplishment of the Ancient Greeks. There are great photos opportunities and other ruins to see while there as well
"Basic, but beautiful.","Free for you walk right up to and take photos, inspect etc.  Beautiful piece of history.  Lit up quite well at night too."
Impressive,"Its pretty crowded around this temple, and in the evening even more. But it is ok. There are also some old buildings around it."
Lovely site,Visited here mid-week with kids.  Lovely location which is part of much larger 2nd century historical set of structures/ city.  Marble is well worn as expected but they are doing a lot of restoration nearby.  The site is on the sea so lovely breeze most of the day.It‚Äôs hot so take plenty of water.
Side history,"Spent a couple of hours exploring the ancient sites in Side. Very accessable sites including the amphitheatre, temple of Apollo and the Byzantine hospital. Well worth a visit."
Beautiful day and night,Go and visit. A walk in the ancient area is a must! Beautiful night and day. Free to visit! Beautiful walk around the harbour!
Great Place,"Great place to watch the sun go down, awesome photos then a few nice restaurants close by!!Can get very crowded at certain times in the early evening though."
Amazing,"This temple was only a 20 minute walk from our hotel, it's magnificent, set right on the beach. I could not believe how huge the ruins were. I recommend it to visit."
Temple of apollo,Wow is all I can say about this place. A beautiful setting for a romantic walk. We were lucky enough to visit this on a sunny evening where the sunset really lit up the place.
Beautiful at night ,Visited here one evening so beautiful to see and even more so at night. Lots of people here taking in the sights .
Beautiful seaside village,"I believe Side was one of Cleopatra's favourite venues when she wanted a break from all the Egyptian political intrigues, and I can imagine why.  There, one seems to step back a few thousand years into another world.  There isn't very much to see in Side - an ancient amphitheatre, and some ruins sums it up pretty well."
It is the only place that is free in Side. ,You should read story behind the ruins. You will not spend more than 15 mins there and it is free. We also took a boat $5 per person.
Worth a visit,"A lovely spot to visit to walk round the ruins of the old temple, situated overlooking the sea, a great spot for pictures both in the day and at night."
Worth a visit ,"This is a great way to experience history. The ruins are accessible, you can touch lots of the area including the Temple of Apollo if you like. Lovely back drop of the beach, and a number of ruins s some of which are tastefully preserved are nearby. Worth a visit. It's free!!"
Great to see this ancient temple,"Apollo's temple  and the other  ruins are well worth  a visit  in  Side.  We took the bus feom our hotel whoch was only 5 turkish lira each, much cheaper than the taxis, and they drop you at the bus station so you take  a lovely walk through all  of the ruins, passing the  amphitheatre down through the old town gates to the temple.Unlike here in Britain with some historic sites, the temple is fully accessible which makes this a magical and tactile experience.As we also did  the boat tour a different day - we had the opportunity  to see it  from the sea, imagining what it was like many years ago when others may have come tonthw temple and harbour in this way.Well worth a visit."
Must go at night!,Must go here both during the day and at night.Stunning and an amazing bit of history.We walked to the site however I believed there are guided trips on offer.
Place where you are feeling history...,"I was here twice (October, 2018 and July, 2019). You can feel history by touching those an old stones, colognes and etc. When I was there the first time it was the end of touristic season that is why I felt it better. But even the second time I felt that specifical historical vibes... And to think how could people built such things so many years ago without any technology..."
Awesome at night!,"To get to the harbour from our hotel we had to pass this fabulous ruin.  I took lots of pictures, from morning ones, to afternoon ones, to ones at night.  I loved it.  We will miss our walk past it."
Side by day,This is near the harbour area and is in the process of being renovated as there was plenty of boarding and plant nearby so not much left.
Nice view,"It was nice to visit also this part of Side, where the Apollo temple has a gorgeous view of the ocean. History aspect is definitely interesting, given that Cleopatra of Egypt and caesar Marcus Antonius had a few private sessions here ;-)But as it was August, we were there together with hundreds of other tourists all trying to get their Instagram picture perfect. Especially the last part was fun, hilarious how people make a fool of themselves thinking they are looking great ;-)"
Day or Night worth a visit,"We saw this at night lit up, and during the day, it‚Äôs great to see, worth a short visit, lots of restoration work going on nearby."
Side,This is really worth a visit it‚Äôs absolutely amazing!! There‚Äôs lots of lovely shops and restaurants near by
Nice!,We went for sunset and it was nice if you like visiting historical sites. Lots of nice picture opportunities. Would definitely recommend taking a look.
Must visit,"Set beside the harbor in Side, the Temple of Apollo cannot be missed. It is absolutely free to browse, touch and take photos. Information around the site is displayed in English and German and details the incredible history of both the Temple and Side itself."
Boat trip,We visited via a boat trip from our hotel. The place looked good. However there was construction machinery on site including a large crane which was disappointing. However as this was part of a great boat trip from the Ali Bey Club hotel we did not mind too much.
Quick trip,"Went on a very hot August day, the temple is in ruins but the facade impressive. Worth a visit, free to walk around."
Must see place,Once ur in Side this is the place to visit. Before getting there u can walk on the main shopping street and at the seashore
Stunning,It stands by the Mediterranean tall and strong. I wish we visited duri g sun set. It would have been even marvellous view
Stunning by the sea,"This stands proud by the sea, so the view is fab. Amazing that it has stood the test of time. Lots of work in the whole town to restore and preserve the ruins."
Amazing ,Loved this bit of Side. The temple makes for some great photos come sunset! Looks fantastic lit up at night time too.Also worth a travel round the coastline on one of the many boats moored across the harbour.
Amazing,Place is just stunning.It is unbelievable that this amazing piece of history is sited in town and can be accessed by all. If this was in England we wouldn't be able to get anywhere near it. It is a wonderful site. we visited during the day and night and saw it from a boat trip. Very impressive
Beautiful site,"A must view if visiting Antalya, very busy in the evenings as situated in the harbour at Side, lots of historic ruins to see."
"History, History, History","Loved this site,I just can't get enough of places like this steeped in history. We got there via a lovely seafront walk and spent about an hour just soaking up the atmosphere.....outstanding"
WOW,"Just an amazing place, just stunning.... this place is a must see on any trip to the area..... simply beautiful"
Amazing ruins,"The temple ruins are so huge and old. No other ruins in the town of Didyma, but had lunch at a local restaurant overlooking the ruins. You do this tour combined with Prienne and Miletos."
Site seeing,"We went to see this at 9am, it is an open area and assessable at any time, it was stunning as we were virtually alone there, next to the sea!Some friends went later in the day they said it was crowded so their experience was not as nice as ours"
Beautiful,A beautiful place full of amazing history in an amazing location. Visit on foot or also view from the sea.
Worth a look,Jumped on the bus to the old town for some shopping and came across this. Very pretty with good photo opportunities we went early morning so it was empty. You could grab a boat trip from the harbour whilst your there.
Impressive!,"It‚Äôs just impressive, and the fact it‚Äôs just there! For everyone to see and touch! For free! Amazing!"
Impressive ,Side has many Roman ruins to see which are unspoilt.  Having visited Rome many tines Side has more things you can see and touch from the Roman period. Well worth a visit and walk around all the perfect Roman ruins.
Temple of Apollo,We walked here after visiting the amphitheatre.  Worth seeing but I‚Äôd like to have had the time to see at sunrise as I can imagine it would be amazing views.
Beautiful sight that leaves you speechless,"We arrived at the coastal down of Side by the bus and walked through the ancient ruins in the city to arrive at the temple of Apollo. The monument is huge, clean, beautiful and awe inspiring. There are crowds but the area is so huge, that you don't get claustrophobic. You can walk to the sea but the beach is extremely rocky - so leave your shoes on. Its extremely sunny and hot in the day - so wear your sunscreen and carry an umbrella and water. On the way back, one can visit the shops in the beautiful streets of this town to pick up some well crafted artefacts. There is a town shuttle that runs a round-trip every half an hour or so and can be taken to the visitor's parking area."
Well worth a visit,We was surprised how nice this is well worth visiting even if temperatures are high even the 6 year old enjoyed the visit
Temple of apollo,This was a great place to visit. The temple and buildings were nice to look at and there was also camel rides. The markets are really good and we spent hours looking here. There is also lots of restaurants within the markets fo choose from. All the people are really friendly and serve you really well. Lovely place to spend the evening.
Worth the walk,Walked to the temple in blazing heat luckily only the baking evening sun... it was beautiful to see and worth every minute
Lovley,"Lovley ruins of temple of Apollonius, took some great photographs  .  Imagined going back in time . Saw a. Couple having wedding photographs taken ther so beUtiful."
Interesting old site being renovated,"The site is currently being renovated, the temple is accessible and you can walk all around, but there is fencing and machinery to repair/renovate the older parts. Well worth a view"
Apollo Temple,The Apollo Temple was only a 45 minute walk from our hotel so we walked there several times during our month's stay. Truly stunning.
Amazing! ,"Beautiful evening visit here with the family. Amazing historical place. Didn't get enough time here, but will be back in October. Looking forward to exploring more!"
Beautiful ,This is why we came to Side. A beautiful piece of history. Stunning especially when the backdrop is a clear blue sky which meets the sea.
Interesting lots of building work,Visited recently interesting although very hot would like to return when all the excavations are finished.Loved the glass walkways in Side with ruins underneath you.Visited Side 30 years ago and what a change to the town excavations have been tastefully done and the town is good for bargains!
Place was empty,"Took the dolmas from our hotel Roma beach resort and spa to Side 5 Turkish lira one way so cheap. Took about 35 minutes. Only one restaurant had people in and the rest empty. It was a hot day but it was deserted. A tip when you get off the dolmas don‚Äôt go near the camels it‚Äôs a con and they take you on a ride whether you want one or not and charge you high prices, hang on to your mobile phones. They even charge you to go to the ladies or gents. Been to side before not a lot changed, dearer and there taking there time preserving the ruins."
Awesome!,"Totally unbelievable, to think of the people who have stood there so many years ago!  Something free to see, and amazing."
Amazing to see,"We popped along to see the temple whilst on a shopping day to side, 20mins taxi from our hotel Arcanus. People in the town great, the ruins are amazing with great detail, hard to think thousands of years ago people had these skills with limited tools, so hot so we had a pit stop in Liman beach bar great setting."
Side is fine,Side is ancient city. You can enjoy walking anytime. There are a lot of people. But you have to visit this place if you have holiday near Side.
Wonderful sunset,Arrived here early evening to a stunning site. best photograph opportunity is at sunset  wasnt too busy and well kept
Wow,Visited Side early June. What an amazing place. So much to see and so much history to be discovered. You walk on glass floors with ruins under them . The temple of Apollo is situated near the harbour. We firstly visited at sunset. What a beautiful sight!
Amazing location but not a lot to see,"A bit disappointing given the other sites around Side, which are well worth a mornings visit. Amphitheater and walled approaches to the town far more impressive."
old town,well lit at night for photos and you are allowed to get close up although some were climbing all over them I think it is disrespectful
Must see,Really impressed by this hidden gem on the coast of Side.The whole area has many historical attractions and this is one of the best. If you have a push chair or buggy beware that the area around the temple is sandy and difficult to manoeuvre.
Nice landmark,"Nice remains of greek temple. Kind of sleepy place, which is nice compared to the humm of resorts. There is a lot of cafes around with nice view"
Is this it?,"The excavations in Side are very interesting. You can walk around free of charge and see lots of interesting things. And you begin to understand that underneath where yoy are standing, there is even more, which is not yet exposed. The theatre itself is impressive and ok to see, but the rest is more exciting. I would recommend reading the history of Side on the internet before going exploring."
Beautiful,This place was so beautiful amazing pictures were taken. Highly recommend you to visit if you are in side
Apollo Temple,"Absolutely beautiful, a must visit when your in Side, all of the ruins and harbour area are stunning."
Stunning,"It's a must to go and see these ruins, it's history, it's stunning and well worth an hour of your time to take it all in"
Great visit.. ,Amazing views. Great to witness a bit of history with a glass of vino in hand. Looks great during the day and amazing at night when lit up..
Perfect,"Very nice place. Place you should visit when you are in Side. Entrance free of charge, the most beautiful during the sunset"
beautiful setting for photographs,A lovely walk along the seafront brings you to the temple while we were there we witnessed the moon rising one evening (17th June 2019 ) where the reflection of the moon on the sea started as a narrow strip with sharp edges and as the moon rose it widened.  All in all a beautiful spot to get away from the constant hustling of the traders.
Amazing ,"These ruins were breathtaking an amazing sights ,side is a lovely quaint place to visit so much history and charm."
Beautiful,"Beautiful temple, nice area to walk around in.Would definitely recommend visiting and I will come back next time I'm in Side."
Beautiful ,"Located just next to the harbour, so we linked the trip here with dinner and went at sunset, a great place to take pictures and soak up the culture. Many people were seated around this area, having a drink and watching the sunset"
Amazing,I cannot believe that these places still exist where you can walk around for free. I passed this every day on my walk around the peninsula.
Interesting site,A beautiful position right on the coast providing lovely photo opportunities.  Interesting historical site.
Interesting,Large rather untidy site right on the beach and close to the harbours where both short trips on small boats and longer trips on large ships are available.The main arch supported by columns and with some of the original stone roof is impressive.  The rest of the site features other structures and many large stones and parts of columns are scattered around.very much a work in progress.
Simply stunning ,What more can I say? It is a very beautiful monument and is hard to beat. Just at the end of the harbour but you can‚Äôt miss it - honestly!!!
At night is the best,This temple is most beatufull at night... wind from sea and lamp doing amzing romantik atmosfery. Is free...we went there by promenade near sea.
More being discovered each day,"Very interesting site most of it free to enter, the main Roman road through site is still being uncovered now."
Ruins,"Ok for a 5 minute look, easy to walk to a nice bar to stop at at the end.  Quite impressive, not full of tourists."
Worth a visit,If your ever in Side or even thinking about going to side I highly recommend you go here. Absolutely stunning and right next to the sea. Plenty of information boards so you can read about the past and get a feel of what it was like there at that time
Great views ,"Visited the temple June 2019, 2013 and 2008 still very nice to look at, great for a photo. Lovely place"
A piece of history.,This attraction was so beautiful when lit up at night. Spectacular site. Worth the walk. Took lots of photos.
Beautiful ,"Beautiful views, lots to see! Not much information given about the actual site but you can just google search it It‚Äôs lit up at night and looks just as beautiful. Great for photos in the day and night. It‚Äôs surrounded by sea- beautiful view Take comfortable food wear to make the most out of walking and climbing. Free attraction unless you take the tour. Near by is nice lots of restaurants, shisha cafes and shops"
Day visit,"Part of a day visit to Side... Very surprised to find free access to the site, not much in the way of information about the site but easily remedied by a quick Internet search. Beautiful views, a lovely visit."
Just look down,The ruins are fantastic in this area and the harbour is lovely but in our experience all the shop owners and restaurant owners ruin the experience as you cannot walk 5 minutes without being pestered which gets rather tiresome. Also try to go later in the day when it cools off a bit as was way too hot for us which ended up with us leaving early.
"Free Attraction, great photo opps","You can browse the harbour and Temple of Apollo at no charge. Nice area, go during sunset for best sunset views and photo opps"
Family visit - May - June 2019,"Visited Apollo place for a check-mark. Not impressed, but still Ok.Can get there on bus from Manavget to Side"
Apollo and Aphrodite Temple,"This ancient Temple in ruins is just  a few metres off the main promenade of Side, Turkey and overlooks the Mediterranean.  It covers only a small area, and it is easy for individuals without disabilities to get around, as long as appropriately supporting footwear is worn.Great architecture that seems to be undergoing reconstruction in parts, there is narrative writing to describe the history of the temple.  There is not a huge amount to see, therefore a short visit would suffice, but it is a superb site for photographs including the sailboats passing in the Med., as part of a magnificent backdrop!It is uneven in areas so care must be taken on getting around, and if planning to spend an hour or so there, it is advisable to take a drink if you do not wish to pay for drinks in the nearby pub (cannot provide any comment on this as did not go in).It is well worth a visit, if only to imagine what has occurred centuries before, and to appreciate the fabulous skills of the architects and builders at the time of construction.A really good experience that was free!"
Spectacular view ,If you like ruins ....perfect photo opportunities .. wearing good footwear is advised as the ground was very uneven ...well worth a look ..better at night when all lit up ...
Not to be missed,The temple of Apollo is right on the sea front in Side and is beautifully lit up by the sun in the day and floodlights at night. It‚Äôs a must see if visiting Side (you can‚Äôt really miss it). There was loads of people taking photos as expected when we were there but it did not stop us from getting some really good ones.
Worth seeing ,Deffinatly worth going to look at you can see some really intricate well preserved carvings and if you get a chance go at night as it looks even more impressive with the lighting then
Beautiful bit of history ,"One of the main reasons we chose to go to Side was to see the historical sights, and apollo doesn't disappoint its spectacular to see"
Stunningly beautiful ,"History and beauty all rolled into one, stunning.  A must visit along with all of the ruins in Side.Great place and very informative."
Beautiful ,Absolutely beautiful huge ... take a hat as its boiling but well worth visiting  is right next to the harbour  and side town so shopping is unlimited  ...
Spectacular views,"Easy to get to and free, amazing to check out with fantastic views worth the walk down.There isn't much there but great for photo opportunities."
Amazing,"Centuries on and still standing. If you‚Äôre in Side, be sure to walk around these fantastic ruins... its free !! Well preserved columns and archways and great photos to take back home."
Nice temple ,"Nice temple , but the ruins are not WoW ! Its small the area , there is only these pillars , the rest is wrecks which People use for bowel movements and bon fires . It doesnt feel like an ancient site . We need excursions and it would be nice if they cleaned it up abit ."
Must see........................,Good to see...well worth the visit to this monument.Plenty to see and read plus perfect for pictures............
Excellent view ,"Loved visiting here, especially around the evening time.Amazing views, well worth the visit. It‚Äôs well lit at night time too for visits. If you are in Side, would recommend temple of Apollo."
Meh,"Place is closed and you cant access.Photos of the place give it fare share of attention, drove around it couple of times due to traffic"
Romantic and fun stroll at night,Really nice to walk around and take photos. At night time it‚Äôs beautifully lit and for some photos it‚Äôs perfect. I think it would be nice to go with a low sun for some day light photos and then you can walk around to until the sunsets for some night photos too.
Nice to visit if in the area,"Nice to visit if in the area, close to the beach. Some interesting ruins and some details about them."
Lovely at sunset,Absolutely beautiful for a sunset stroll along the beach to here.Lots of little bars and restaurants.
Must visit in Side,"If you are in holiday in Side area,you must visit it.Is very nice in the evening.I came with my family and it was amazing."
A Must visit if in Antayla,Wonderfully preserved and in touch with what the Romans accomplished all those years ago. Idyllic back drop for some wonderfull timed photos
Nice to have a look,Windy down by the sea. Nice to walk there when temp is climing up to 32+degrees.nice plase to visite
Stunning views at night,By day very impressive but the Temple really comes alive at night when it's illuminated. It makes a breath taking backdrop to any photo
well preserved,It is a lovely picturesque scene near the water front that is great for a photo opportunity as it is a great location
Side at its best,Its about a 30 minute walk from the bus station or you can catch a free shuttle bus to the shopping street and it's about 10 minutes from there.Its worth the effort certainly.
worth a visit,nice spot to get photos with sea as the backdrop-a must visit in the night when its lit up also some ruins by the side of it
Beautiful,"Really worth a vist, amazing it's still standing. So much history, beautiful at night with the lights on it."
Beautiful ,Lovely place in day and at night. We walked down here almost every night at was still as great the 1st time.
A nice way to spend an afternoon,There‚Äôs no reason why one shouldn‚Äôt visit this place. It‚Äôs free and definately a sight for sore eyes. One can easily spend a half a day just wandering around the ruins. If you get tired just stop for a cup of coffee and enjoy the magnificient view to the sea.
Worth a visit. ,"We were staying just down the front so visited a few times. Both in the daytime and on an evening when the temple is lit beautifully. Excursions combine bussing people here with lots of other bits so be prepared for it to be busy. We found it quieter on an evening. The whole of S√¨de has ruins all over but these are up there with the best. Defo talk a walk, Dolmus or taxi here!"
"Side,","Amazing ruins. Situated all around the harbour area, free access to all but the amphitheatre and museum. Still plenty to witness with many of the ruins by the roadside . A good way to spend half a day, and is very popular"
Beautiful!,Easy to get too & location by the sea just makes it all the more wonderfulCan go to the museum but we spent an afternoon around the other sites. Would have gone to the museum had we visited Side again
Stunning to see in person,"Very impressive ruins, positioned overlooking the coast, the arrangements of the damaged rocks around are well thought out and well preserved, although the tourist do keep climbing on them for the ‚Äòperfect selfie‚Äô ‚Äì shame, but otherwise a great sight worth going to."
Fantastic ruins,Be sure to walk around these fantastic ruins. Can't believe its free to do so. Well preserved columns and archways to be seen.
Amazing !!,Such an amazing place to visit and for free !! We visited it 2 times during our 6 days of holiday !!! Highly recommend
Naseem,Beautiful visit in the evening well worth the visit to this historical site many 5 star hotels to  stay in would love to visit again
Awe inspiring,"Sitting near so many other antique sites in Side, this is surely one of the best for a photo opportunity. Absolutely steeped in history and is complemented by multi language information boards throughout the area.Amazing."
Positioning,A wonderful sight to behold at the edge of the peninsula. A fantastic opportunity for a photo for all. The ground is uneven so pay attention when admiring the view. The harbour is just around the corner as well as bars/ restaurants.
Amazing to see,So your just taking a nice stroll along the coast when all of a sudden you are faced with the towering columns of the temple of Apollo stooped in history and free of charge what an amazing site well worth a look
Amazing,"To be able to walk around the ruins of old Side and be able to touch, see and look at the artefacts close up was brilliant. Keep an eye out where you walk though as you may stand on a mosaic and not realise."
Gorgeous ruins,We stayed in one of the resorts in Side and walked here approx 30 min walk.  This is a must see attraction. Gorgeous tall ruins with the blue ocean as the backdrop. No entrance fee and a great place to take selfies. Thousand old ruins still look amazing. A short walk from here is the port and local shops and restaurants. Watch when you go to shops though. I looked at one of the hand bags and the seller was pushy to get me to buy and when I didn‚Äôt he hurled verbal abuse at me all the way as I was exiting the shop saying if I said I like the bag then why was I not buying it and that I am a liar and that my job was a teacher in school of lies.
Goregeous..!!!,Great place to visit on Side's Peninsula not far from Manvgat Falls.Centuries old ruins still visible. On entrance we got internal transfer to the temple from the parking. A nice walk back from the temple with magnificent  view of the Mediterranean sea and walk through street both sides with shops.
Beautiful against sea backdrop ,Stunning against the ocean backdrop. Nearby bars and shops for a drink on the way or a bit of lunch . Harbour around the corner.
Worth a visit,Pretty amazing how the columns are just lying along the road. Hopefully they may rebuild it one day!
Impressive site,Amazed at the area these ruins cover over the old part of Side. Worth a visit when coming here and use the free bus back to the dolmus after exploring
Family fun,Great place to visit. Some great history here. Well worth a visit. Even though it's a reconstruction.  Its gives u an idea of what It was like.
Stunning view,"The bus station is a lettle bit further away (15/20 mins walk) from the attraction. Howevere, you can catch a free bus ride from the bus station to the actual attraction. The free bus drops you at the Amphitheater entrance. The attraction looks nice during the day but it is lit up during the night which make it even more beautiful. Take your cameras for beautiful pictures. There is no entrance fee to pay and remember to wear good sensible shoes. There are lots of seafront cafe and bars with great ambiance but the rates for any food or drink is very expensive."
"Great during the day, but better at night.","Situated after the harbour, this is free to visit and interesting to look at, but far better visually at night especially with the lasers in the background.Just be careful as the ground is very uneven and rocky under foot.Some nice bars and restaurants nearby as well."
Interesting,"The temple is spread over a large area against the backdrop of the ocean, ground is pretty uneven and would recommend wearing proper footwear"
Fabulous,"If you enjoy history then Side is the place to go. You can wonder around the sand dunes and come across old pieces of buildings city walls ect, lots to do, the museum and amphitheater are well worth a visit."
Amazing,Nothing to tell just go and visit this magical place There are few small hotels around and the view is perfect its clean and the sea view is amazing also there is a wish tree as u can see in my pics
Lots to see and do ,"Lots to see and do for free. Could do with more information about what you are looking at. It almost doesnt seem like its genuine. ""Artifacts"" all over that you can freely touch and take some home if you like lol. Not protected in anyway. We went for a boat tour very close by 30 lira each for an hour, was nice. Easily reachable by car with ample parking."
Beautiful ,"A must for all, my first visit and I had to return for a second visit. Lovely when the sun goes down and to see it illuminated."
Stunning,"A must see location if you are ever near Side. Astonishing to think that this structure has survived so long.No pestering, no souvenir selling near by just sit and absorb the atmosphere and enjoy."
Side ruins,When you arrive at the ruins they are a feature and you can stroll through the ruins at your leisure with no charge.
Temple of apollo,A must see while your in side. You can just wonder round and get some lovely photo's. Close to the harbour with its bars and resturants. And best of all it's free.
Temple Ruins lovely walk around,"Lovely little day trip well worth a walk around just be wary of people trying to sell u maps etc.Also lovely little markets to walk around and restaurants/Cafes to have a coffee, drink or food.  Just be careful over pricing make sure u find the out upfront so u don't get charge more than expected"
Lovely place ,"Enjoyed this trip to Apollo, shopping experience and scenery was beautiful. There's a free bus from the park to this area, which takes us straight through the temple with shopping and eating experiences."
Temple of Apollo ruin,"It would have been an imposing site back in the day when I was built.  Unfortunately there are only 5 columns remaining standing, but they still give you a good idea of what it would have been like."
One word... amazing,"Walking around these ruins were breathtaking, the carvings on the remains are fantastic, it makes you wonder how they managed to do such intricate work without the use of the tools we have now..... do not miss and take time going around."
Only a few columns left but still impressive.,Less to see than other artefacts but still impressive how these columns are still standing after hundreds of years. They are free to see and make a good location for photos especially out to sea. worth visiting then having a drink looking out over the harbour and chill an hour away.
Worth a look while visiting the area,Lovely feature worth looking round while in the area. Me and my mum stayed in Kumk√∂y for a week while on holiday. One day we got a bus into side and had a look around the town. The temple of Apollo is a nice addiction to the shops and sea front. Found it interesting as I like to know about the history of places I visit. Bus was only a few lira each think it worked out about 50p each both ways so would recommend checking out if staying in a nearby town. Free to visit and great for photo opportunities!
Lovely ruin,"There is something special about these ruins, especially if they are authentic such as this temple. The ruin is very old - dated around 2nd century AD. It makes the whole area look special. It is located on quite a big area, you can see it from several blocks away. There are quite a lot of restaurants and cafes in the neighbourhood. During the evening it is really well lit up, I really liked walking around this place."
You should see before you die ......,it is a great historical location..side is a new city that built in historical city. you can live in history.
Temple of Apollo,"It stands, almost a complete ruin apart from the front columns and pediment. It is located by the sea overlooking the harbour. Cleopatra was a visitor her for 6 months. The ruins are not well preserved but they are beautiful. There are other Roman ruins in the area such as the amphitheater."
Must visit,"When in the old town of Side, you must visit the Temple of Apollo. Next to the temple is good restaurants and excellent shopping."
"Important site, accessible to walkers.","Although not, the grandest temple, this one is visible while walking the pleasant and tranquil paths of Side. Antiquities preserved and respected among commercial development is important."
Interesting place to visit.,Its an interesting area to visit. Lots of restaurants to visit and shops for gifts. Temple of Apollo is huge and impressive next to harbour. Worth seeing.
Ancient history at every turn,Wonderful to admire all this ancient history and in beautiful surroundings near the harbour area. All free to wander round and admire the views too.
beautiful place,"I was so Impressed by this area that I went back twice, stunning views and the harbour temple is a sight to behold, places to eat and drink nearby, very friendly relaxing place to visit"
Terrific,"Stunning site, beautiful by day, great to see at night. Large site lots to see ancients ruins, magnificent"
Temple of apollo,Nice location by the harbour.Great place to take a photo to show your friends when you get home.Once taken their is loads more to explore in the old town of side.
Fantastic ruins,"Great place to visit and you can wonder around ruins all day absolutely free,and with side town with its bargain shopping right next to it you won't be bored."
Beautiful,"This is a beautiful ruin of a temple. It's free to visit. If you wander around you will see other parts of the temple which have collapsed/fallen and have been left where they are. Some even at the edge by the sea. It is heavy with tourists here so patience is required if you want to get that ideal photo. The only bad thing about this place was the  copious amounts of empty water bottles littered around the sight. There are plenty of bottle recycle bins dotted about but obviously some people can't be bothered. All in all, this is a lovely place to visit on the edge of Side."
well maintained site,"Visited this November, so being off season I was able to see everything on offer without hordes of other visitors. A wonderful site well worth the few Turkish lira entrance fee. Put it on your list to visit."
Breath taking ,"This is a must visit, especially when the sun goes down, well worth a visit to see the hard work they have done"
Visiting the beauty of side,"Make the temple of Apollo a part of the stunning tour of the ancient ruins around Side. My family and I were fortunate to walk the streets (old and new) of Side on a beautiful day, which made the Temple that even more amazing with the contrasting white stone against the turquoise sea and blue cloudless sky.Definitely worth taking a few hours or an afternoon to enjoy the town and all it has to offer."
