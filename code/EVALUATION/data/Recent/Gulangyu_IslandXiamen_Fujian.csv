So much too see ... ,"And explore. It‚Äôs difficult to just pick one place and say you must go there. My simple advice, take the whole day to walk around and go to very place, even when they als for entrance fee. From great views over Xiamen to ancient history when this was a commercial outpost, many things to see. Don‚Äôt forget the piano museum, even if you are not a music lover the displayed instruments are fabulous."
Fun but hot,"Good day- get your tickets early and get across. No cars, lots of shops and food joints, including cafe bars to shade from the sun. Some hotels too. Plenty of places to see Xiamen from and worth a half/full day."
Ferry to gulangyu island,Gulangyu is an island just a short ferry ride across from Xiamen. Around 15 minutes ferry ride which was very convenient. Just make sure you book your tickets before the day of departure. And collect it at time of visit. We book ours via a yellow APP called ‚Äòma feng wo‚Äô. Only one ferry terminal is running during our visit due to the pandemic. So make sure you check prior to visit. We are holding foreign passports but residing in China. No problem getting the tickets. Thought I‚Äôd mention it here because that was the first question on our minds. We were afraid they were only open for locals at this moment and only allowed local IDs.  Ferries are all on time. No delays. Do purchase a route map on the ferry itself. It was very helpful for us. It‚Äôs an only pedestrian island so prepare to do a lot of walking. And it‚Äôs kind of a hilly island. Not flat. So going up slopes can be a little tiring but still fun. Lots to eat and lots to see. Spend some time at the sandy beach. Beach is relatively clean and beautiful. Gulangyu island is considered a touristy place. But we could still find a lot of authenticity.
Great place to see Xiamen‚Äôs past ,"If you only have time to visit one place in Xiamen, this is the place. You will see a lot of old wester style buildings built in 1920s by the wealthy at that time. You can also enjoy local food in the back allies. Walking around will take a day, although you can also take electric shuttle cars.  During pandemic, you need no reservation in advance to visit Gulangyu. But make sure you bring IDs and mask to ride on boat to the island. The roads were not friendly for stroller though."
Stolling along the streets without cars,"It's not easy to enter this place as you need to take the ferry which cost some money, where you need to que. There is nothing iconic but you can just enjoy walking around narrow streets, have some great mango juice and seefood. I would avoid any holiday or weekend time, that might be crowded."
While in Xiamen,This little pedestrian island should be a must-stop for visitors in Xiamen. The first time we were there was in 1988 and the last time in 2020. What a difference! It was very crowded in the summer but still worth to spend some time there. Our private tour guide was able to book our tickets ahead of time and it was just a relaxing day for us. There are a lot of history here on this island being a UNESCO site with plenty of Victorian style buildings built after the Nanjing Treaty period. Stay for a day to fully enjoy this island.
Lovely structures,"We went before the crowds return, they have  a Starbucks now! Quaint town.  Wear good walking shoes.  I love it there."
A little island next to Xiamen,"Good place to go! Just avoid public holidays... too many people and too much noisy. You can take a boat from Xiamen port, it needs just 20 minutes to arrive in that tropical little island! It is not place for swimming etc but it is beautiful and it worth to go!"
One day tour ,This place is reachable with or without tour via ferry. But would recommend a guided tour as there are many historical sites on the island. One full day is recommended.
Quite nice,"Touristy - yes, definitely . But there is still enough small things to do on the Island that you can enjoy. We walked to Haoyueyuan and was able to climb to where the statue was to look back at Xiamen Island. That was fun and easy enough to walk to and navigate back. Zengcuoan (could be spelled wrong) is the pedestrian street with loads of little shops and vendors selling snacks and treats. Price was reasonable - more than in Xiamen but not nearly as inflated as over tourist-traps). It is busy there, lots of travellers from mainland China visit this island. This does mean there is some pushing and shovelling to get on and off the ferry. To get there and back, you could go through a travel agency or some hotels may help with booking. You need your passport to book."
A bit disappointed,The island itself is neat and quite pretty but don‚Äôt really live up to the hype... the experience of the ferry ride was the primary upset. Many people pushing and yelling rushing to get on the ferry. The island itself was also over crowded. Many attractions also required additional payment to visit and are quite overpriced.  Nevertheless it‚Äôs ok to visit but keep the expectation down.
Touristic,"Our hotel concierge helped to buy the CNY 60 ferry ticket with an additional charge of CNY 10 the previous evening.We arrived at the terminal 1 hour prior. Scanning the bags was fast for the higher priced ticket while lower priced had longer queue but not as bad as what was highlighted in some reviews due to the low season travel now.  The ferry ride was just 20 minutes. Many tour guides would approach you to provide chargeable service the moment you get off from the ferry.There were many tourists mainly from other states of China. All places of interest would charge additional entrance fee ranging from CNY15 onwards so you need to be selective in the places you wish to see.There are shops selling souvenirs, fruits, snacks & drinks everywhere on the island. You will notice 3 shops next to each other having long queue for rice flat noodle, cheese potatoes snack and Lin Shi Fishball.Tips to share: 1) There are not many public toilets and dustbins around. 2) Travel light since you can easily buy snack food & drinks.3) Peak hours to leave the island is from 3-5‚Äôish pm.Overall we found that Gulangyu Island was over-rated and too commercialized which has spoilt the peacefulness of the island."
Many tourists ,The place is good. Natural scenery. Can walk around for the whole day. But too many tourists. The ferry ride leaving the island not enjoyable. Really too many people.
I don‚Äôt know why I went theree,Full of domestic travelers. Very crowded even on a weekend! Nothing special. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to overseas travelers. The ferry ride was fun but - just for such a short ferry ride u will hve to go through a lot of hassle
I love Gulangyu Island ,"Grateful to explore  Gulangyu Island in half day, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site which is an 8 minute ferry ride from Downtown Xiamen. It is the home of beautiful villas, ancient relics, narrow streets, beautiful museums and good food!The beautiful island is famous for its natural beauty, colonial style architecture and a myriad of interesting museums. A great place for sight seeing with so many interesting shops around the area. A must visit while in Xiamen."
The spirit of Europe in the cemter of China,"This little island is just accross the canal from Xiamen city. The water tram takes you there in just a few minutes. On the island you will find all old style buildings and small streets from the times of european citizens of this island. You can visit piano museum, sea zoo, old churches, monuments, etc. There are several restaurants serving seafood attractions im local style so the lunch or dinner will have an oriental taste which is great."
Must seen ,"A very nice historical place you must see in xiamen. Easy access with a wonderful super comfortable ferry , costs 60 Yuan per round ticket. Goes and comes back every 30 minutes ( 24h ) so you don't have to be worried about the time. Don't miss to see the piano museum and the wax museum. Food is great but a little expensive ."
Unique Island with Multi-Nationals Buildings ,"In the history, China was ‚Äòinvaded‚Äô by many foreign countries and ‚Äòrented‚Äô her land for trades and military purposes. Gulangyi is one of them. There are many mansions built on this island by foreign countries and they are now renovated to become homestay for tourists. It is unique and beautiful. Scale up to Sunlight Rock to have a birdeye view of the Island, as well as the seafront of Xiamen."
Beautiful but crowded,"The journey to the island is a little bit stressful, even though I had a reserved ticket, nobody spoke English in the terminal and I was directed to various gates before finding the right one for my ferry. Once on the island, it is a bit of a tourist trap and the crowds are a bit much. However, the tour groups seem to be directed to go a certain route and it is possible to find quieter places. I particularly enjoyed the small pottery shop and some of the quieter tea shops. I would visit again."
so much so interesting ,spent nearly five hours on the island and covered not even a third of the interesting sights.  buildings were very well preserved and utilised ... a great mix of museums and commercial interests.  bring good shoes because no cars in gulangyu.
Impressive,"Took the public ferry with a local resident which was fantastic as she knew where to go and how to get there. I was surprised with the number of visitors but even though it was busy it was peaceful and relaxing. If you have plenty of energy make the climb which is a massive rock centrally located on the island which is 90 meters above sea level. Afterwards we walked down the back of the island and went to a beautiful garden. We racked up close to 17,000 steps do come with plenty of energy and enjoy Xiamen finest üëç"
Crowded with tourists,Not a bad place to visit when you visit Xiamen. Limit numbers of visitors daily. Taking the ferry to the island is kind of chaotic if you are on your own. Take their tram when on island to certain points of interest. Too far to walk especially with kids. Food there are ok. There is a food street where there are many food to choose from n there are some stalls that hv super long q.
Don't dismiss visiting in the evening,"We chose to take the first local ferry available to tourists in the late afternoon rather than trying to fight for a day ticket at the international terminal.  While we would not have got to see all the attractions, we found the night atmosphere in the food streets to be very enjoyable and we had great food at low prices.  If you cannot get there during the day, it is still worth a 2-3 hour visit after dark."
Worth a day trip,"Beautiful island, we walked all over it. Cool little villages that sometimes make you think you were in Europe with the architecture. Very pretty landscape, we saw a whole lot of people getting wedding photos taken there.many great restaurants and coffee shops. A lot of tourist areas packed with funky shops and restaurants. Total tourist trap areas but it was all so cheap it was fun to check it out and try different food. You have to take a ferry to get there and back but it wasn't bad at all."
A beautiful island within Xiamen with a piano museum,"As part of a Viking Ocean excursion, we visited Gulangyu Island and enjoyed the scenery, Shuzhuang garden, and the piano museum. There is a cultural tradition on the island which also features mansions and impressive European style buildingd and bridges. I have numerous photos of our experience on the island."
Waste of time,"This place is popular only by historical reputation. It is full of Chinese tourists, but the place is no more than narrow streets full of small shops selling the same stuff. The ferry is unpleasantly crowded, the famous scenery and serenity are totally gone, the shops mundane and and the food uninteresting. I would avoid it like the plague."
Missing Gulangyu,A lovely tourist spot with breathtaking view and lots of local foods. I suggest to buy the ferry ticket in advance as there are many visitors even on normal days. Hope to be back again soon.
Charming little island ,"Tickets wise: bring a passport as you‚Äôll need it to buy ferry tickets. It is possible to buy tickets on the spot for CNY50 and up, up to an hour before departure, depending on availability. Coming back is free.GLY is with colonial relics like Building‚Äôs and stuff. It is worth spending half a day here just wondering around and getting lost in the Warren of tiny streets. The place is filled with a Chinese kids and couples getting their photos taken, so you won‚Äôt feel shy trying to take a photo like them."
Busy little island,"The island was packed with local tourists. Getting in and out of the ferry could be an experience due to number of people trying to get in. Some local tour group could be quite pushy in their way to get to the ferry.Many many shops inside. Not many English written sign which could be a challenge trying to find your way, particularly if you are on limited time on the island like i was."
Pretty,"Gulangyu Island is about a 15 minute ferry ride from Xiamen. Ferries are every 15 minutes. Being a visiting foreigner, I had to bring my passport to purchase a ticket. I was doing some volunteer work on the island for Tzu Chi foundation (separating garbage - recycling)It‚Äôs a fairly hilly island and lots of colonial type buildings dotted around the place. It usually has a plaque on the wall by the buildings stating when it was built and what it was used for.Lots of touristy groups so be prepared for crowds. No vehicles allowed on the island so be prepared for the walk around although there are lots of little stalls, cafes, souvenir stalls etc around.Worth making a trip there either for a half or full day. There are local places to stay in too."
Excellent hotel,Great location and staff.  Easy to get to all the key sites in Xiamen.  Really helpful with any of your needs
Nice,"No cars. Lots of walking and photo opportunities. Lots of things to see. If you're a non Chinese tourist, make sure you get the correct boat back. Some are for nationals only! The last one leaves at 6pm if you're planning on not staying overnight"
The piano museum is a must!,"Buy your ticket directly at the pier. Don‚Äôt believe the hotels / travel agencies/ taxis even who tell you that these will be sold out! They are trying to sell you your packages, which (if you‚Äôre used to independent travelling and hate tourist traps) you‚Äôll regret! We visited on a public holiday and it was fine. At the pier, you‚Äôll need to queue a short while to buy your return ticket, with a fixed boat time for the outwards portion. The sunlight viewing point and piano museum are my top recommends. Incredible collection of beautiful pianos and harpsichords that you can admire, with impromptu performances. From the viewing point you have great views across the island and towards Xiamen. As long as you‚Äôre prepared for the crowds, you‚Äôll be fine!"
Superb historical buildings,Fantastic day. Ferry with great views of the harbour. Lots of great architecture and some really brilliant old colonial buildings. Excellent walk around the island. Gardens and piano museum pretty good too. Climb sunrise rock for panoramic view
Colonial heritage and western legacy,"Gulangyu is a small island just some 1km off Xiamen. Its cultural heritage is rooted in its western colonial history and legacy as it was opened to western countries more than 100 years ago. Once there was a strong presence of a flourishing western society including foreign ambassies, churches, residences and even hospital etc. There are a few major tourist sights such as a rich overseas Chinese home and garden. The city centre is a bit over commercialized with lots of gift shops and small restaurants selling more or less the same kind of souvenirs and food. The island can be reached by ferry from Xiamen and the ride takes about 20 minutes."
Arrive very early or else!,"We booked tickets online for the 07:50 ferry on a Wednesday morning. Got in line 40 minutes in advance of departure to pick up the tickets. Got the tickets in our hands at 07:41, but the (single and only) line for the security check was at least 200-300 people long. Security check involves scanning your ticket, ID and your bags, and it almost seems like you're going on an international flight as opposed to a 15 minute ferry ride. We tried pushing our way to the front, but so were half the other people who had tickets for the same departure time, so we got nowhere and just abandoned the idea of going to Gulangyu. Interestingly enough the ticket windows were still selling 07:50 tickets at 07:40 when we picked ours up, and I don't know why because there's no way anyone could possibly make it to the boat on time (ticket checking supposedly ends 10 minutes before departure).I've been in China a long time and I'm used to long lines and chaos, but we usually get to where we're going. However, the setup they have here for tickets to Gulangyu is nonsensical. My advice: Arrive at least 90 minutes in advance of departure if you plan on making your boat on time. Gave a two star rating based only on the pre-boarding experience."
Quirky but touristy,"A visit is a must and once you move away from the ferry port, which is very touristy, the island is a great place to explore at leisure.  There is a lot of history and architecture to see, and little places to grab a coffee, juice or something stronger.  Be careful when booking your ticket, we were 'ambushed' and ended up on a half-day tour, most of it in a tea house trying coffee.  Having started the tour at 2pm, we eventually got to the island at 4pm."
Amazing place to visit,"Love xiamen. It's a great place and kinda garden city. When you go down on the streets, you can see the hospital people from China. Gulangyu is the most famous attraction there. Even though it's a small island, it's of great attraction. Beautifully old-fashioned and classic garden buildings, lanes and trees etc. That's a dream island."
Hard work,"Went there last year under recommendation it wasn‚Äôt all words of wisdom ! . For me it was hard work to get there the ferry was like being in a sardine can , packed but I guess not unexpected . The island was probably very nice in years gone by but to me it was very run down and had seen better days . There were many people who were walking around that looked like they were trying to find something of interest but just hadn‚Äôt. The only people that seemed to be having a great time and having a lovely day of it were the wedding photo party people ( and on the day we went there were a LOT ) . Sorry to put a downer on it but my feelings on the day"
A must-go attraction for Xiamen,"Gulangyu island is arguably the No.1 touring attraction for the whole Xiamen, which is generally a charming and beautiful city. There are regular ferries to cross the channel and get to the island. There are at least a handful of famous gardens, museums, memorial, parks ...  One may easily spend 4-5 hours there."
Small Island to walk around!,This place is really nice in the middle of sea very close to Xiamen. Just few minutes of ferry ride and you are there.It is fully crowded with Chinese tourists. When I visited on weekend I hardly found any foreigner. There is a KFC and Macdonalds and lot of Chinese food stalls and restaurants. The place is very humid. Good for a half  day trip.
Must visit when in Xiamen,"I've visited this place twice, the first time on a weekend and the second time on a weekday. It is more relaxed to visit on a weekday (if you can) as there are less visitors so less crowding, less pushing and less chasing over ferry space. On my first visit we rode the golf cart to explore the island but on my second trip we walked around. This place is quaint, rich in history, very clean (no cars are allowed), and it has plenty of places to take nice pictures. For take home goodies, visit Sincere Co. They sell handmade pies, dried seafood and dried fruits."
A place full of history,"The island is quite difficult for travellers to get to as you need to ""book"" your tickets which are limited. The island requires lots of energy --- you need to walk a lot, for example walk uphill and downhill. Thus it could be a bit challenge for kids to go. Looks like half of the buildings are out of maintenance and lots of bungalows are abandoned.The way to the Sunlight rock could be challenge for kids and could be very narrow at certain section, but the rock itself provides a spectacular view of the entire island."
Great sightseeing!,"Wear good walking shoes! There is a lot of distance to cover!Plan to spend the whole day, if you can. Too many neat sights and places to visit if you are trying to squeeze it all in a few hours.The admission to Sunlight Rock (litkonggiam) is well worth it. It is a moderately strenuous walk up several flights of stairs, but you are treated to a 360 degree view of Gulangyu and Xiamen that cannot be beat.Take time to enjoy the interesting eats and snacks of the island! The deep fried potato and the grilled octopus legs are delicious!"
Choose carefully based on holiday style,"this island should be considered depending on the type of holiday you are looking for - if you would like to walk around a lot , relax and take in atmosphere and sights - it is awesome there is shopping to be done on the island - but the same things can be bought in siming district for much cheaper extremely tranquil and beatiful especially when walking away from the crowds kn the outskirts on the island getting here can be a slight hassle and should be considered before booking accomodation on the island the beaches were not as clean as i expected but still quite picturesque"
Gulangyu is something that used to be interesting and hip...,"Well folks, the Gulangyu Island is unfortunately become overrun by visitors and well saturated with people.   The place used to be quiet and cool - somewhere to get away to....Not anymore.  It seems everyone in China (and overseas) got the memo and decided to ""get away"" - as a result all steps including buying a ticket for the ferry, getting on the ferry boat, walking around the island... requires a lot of effort and patience.So, all in all, if you want to explore an interesting place, Gulangyu island will not be it"
Interesting ,"Gulangyu has a very interesting history behind it, so read up a little on it before you go, and it makes your visit that much more meaningful. It is a huge island, accessible only on foot, or you can take their electric buggies for a price. Lots of Victorian era style buildings, food vendors, sculptures, and greenery everywhere. Good way to spend a day."
Need more than 2-3hours!!,"So many treasures on this island! If you love old buildings like me, you are in on a treat! Prepare to stay the whole day. Wonder into small streets and get lost... I have been there twice and still feel I have not explored everything yet...Book the tickets online early if possible or else you are only left with afternoon tickets or buying from touts. If you have time, stay a night in one of the many cool boutique hotels! Some are even like castles!"
GLU island,"Since the waiting to board the ferry to the island, we were so exited, not to be disappointed at all, look for the hidden nice coffee shops!... 100% recommended, no exceptions..."
A beautiful tour,"Interesting Colonial buildings. during our visit it was enough to arrive at the ticket office and buy there, no need to purchase tickets via a site."
Ferry ticket procedure,"A quick reference guide for those who want to travel to Gulangyu Island by ferry.  This is my experience of getting a paper ticket from the ferry pier in person.Getting the ferry ticket for foreigner is not quite straight forward.  There is a ticket office and pier for the local (when I say local, I mean local xiamen residence.  I am a Chinese from Hong Kong and I am considered as a foreigner).  For foreigner, go to the international cruise terminal/ferry pier.  This is a separate location from the local, which is about 2km away.Ticket is 50RMB (luxury, more decorative ferry) round trip.  There is 35RMB basic option but that wasn‚Äôt available at the time.  You need your passport or travel document, ticket will have your document number for security check and boarding.  You need to specify the departure time; the return trip is on ‚Äúgo show‚Äù basis, using the same ticket, so don‚Äôt throw the ticket away until your feet are firmly back on the mainland.Budget time for security check, takes time during peak hours/season.  You need your ID here to match the ID number on your ticket.Once inside the waiting area, look for your boarding gate.  Be at the gate early because seats are very limited.  People shove and push aggressively as soon as the gate is open.  Here you will need your ID again.Walk down the path to the ferry, you will wait for a brief moment.  Again, as soon as they open the second and last gate to the ferry, people shove and push to get to the front to get on.Once on the ferry, the ‚Äúfirst floor‚Äù is air conditioned.  Second floor is open air; third floor wasn‚Äôt open at the time. Ferry time 20 mins.  On the ferry, you can stamp your first ‚Äúsouvenir stamp‚Äù, something that you can collect throughout the island.Return journey:You can board at the Nei Cuo Au ferry terminal (the one you got off, on the west side of the island) before 5:xxpm.  OR San Yau Tian Ferry Terminal anytime, 24 hours.  Note the ferry from San Yau Tian ferry terminal will drop you off at the local terminal instead of the international cruise terminal.  The journey from San Yau Tian is only 5 minutes.If you lose your ticket, you need to buy another one which is 18RMB.  Ferry schedule is posted next to the ticketing window.Hope this helps"
Here's the latest ferry information,"We found the ferry information we found here before our trip extremely helpful, so here's the latest for foreigners traveling to Gulangyu.1. From Xiamen airport, take an airport bus to the International Cruise Terminal. This is called  Xiagu Matou 'Xiamen Drum Pier' (Âé¶ÈºìÁ†ÅÂ§¥), or Dongdu Matou 'East Ferry Pier' (‰∏úÊ∏°Á†ÅÂ§¥,). It's RMB10 pp (a taxi to there is RMB 50). Exit from Gate 7 in Terminal 3 and buy the ticket from the counter. It's the 2nd ferry pier stop, as the first stop is the local ferry pier only for Xiamen residents. It takes around 30 minutes.2. Get in line to buy the ticket for the next departure. Depending on when, you might need to wait for 3-4 ferries, but they go every 20 minutes. This is a ROUND TRIP ticket, so save it for the return. (It does not say that.)3. You can go to San Qiu Tian pier, which is the one on the near (east) side with all the restaurants and small streets. You can also take a ferry to the back (west) side of the island with the beaches and resorts. If you're staying overnight and your hotel is closer to there, take that ferry instead. [We saw lots of tired people hauling suitcases up and over the hilly center to get back to San Qiu Tian pier.]4. After you go through security, watch for your ferry time to be posted and then you will be herded onto the boat. It takes 25 minutes. Don't forget to keep your ticket for the return.5. When we returned, we thought we would be going back to Dongdu Matou. However, the ferry we got herded onto this time just crossed over to the locals ferry pier. It took 5 minutes. Then we grabbed a taxi to the airport, but there's also a subway stop right there.6. Enjoy all the sights and foods of Gulangyu. We stayed in the Louis Hotel and recommend it for its shabby chic and great location (just straight down the promenade past the local ferry pier and the turn right into the alley next to the seafood restaurant.)7. The Piano Museum is no great shakes, just a bunch of old pianos, but they're interesting enough. The best thing to do is just wander around, eat and shop.Have fun!"
Lush like a garden but a bit old,"The island is lush with tropical plants.  It felt like a big garden with trees everywhere.  There are a crowd of tourists on the main streets,  and a lot of the usual souvenir shops.  But if you walk away from the shopping area,  it is nice and quiet.  There are a lot of old mansions from 20/30's revamped into small hotels if you want to stay the night. Western restaurants are limited but i did manage to find 4-5 places who provide western cuisine."
Nice scenic but very crowded,"The only access to the island is by ferry and the we were told by locals that the ferry tickets can only be purchased if we pre-book. Paid RMB198 per person with the high speed rail tickets at their authorised dealer which incld pickup sightsee at nantou temple, free trade zone, tea drinking near the ferry terminal and then ferry ride to gulangyu. The cost does not cover entrance fees to any if the attractions. The ferry ride is very short 5 - 10 mins depending on which terminal you board. The locals and foreigners includeding those mainlanders from other state use a different terminal.Be prepared to be pushed to board and also when disembark from the ferry. The place is surrounded with eateries. Was told by locals becareful when you go for your meals, menu indicate certain prices but once you order you might end up paying a bomb. Better pick food street food or fast food like kfc or Mc Donald"
Nice small island with old architectural buildimg,I had been visited here with my colleague. It is a really ni e island. Only way to reach here from Xiamen is ferry ride. Nice scenic view of Xiamen in night from this island. Bet time to visit this island is evening. Lot of of eateries here.
Getaway island,This is a getaway island for visitors to Xiamen. The trip to/ from the island is via the international ferry terminal. Foreigners need to produce passports for verification when buying tickets. Journey to/ from the island from Xiamen island is about 20min and quite uneventful. Would be good to arrive early and join the queue. Be ready to be pushed around as everyone pushes and rush to board/ disembark the ferry. The island itself is a good change from the main island. The streets are narrow and mainly used for walking. There are hardly any cars on the island. Be prepared to pay for every attraction you want to visit. I went to some of the gardens and the piano museum. Nothing much per se unless you know how to appreciate  pianos of the different ages. There is a labyrinths of streets that has many different local food - both snacks and restaurants. Grab a quick bite if you want. You will need about 3-4hrs to explore the island.
A nice experiance,"Me and my friends visited the island, took a ferry boat ride and started off with exploring the buildings, then went to the undersea world and had a nice time. But for me I wouldn't go there again, saw it once and that's enough for a life time"
Nice day out but watch out for crowds,This is a must do when in Xiamen. Note foreigners must go from the International ferry pier. The ticket is now RMB50 which is a return trip. Also note ferries go to two different ports. We did not have to wait to buy a ticket but we did have to wait just over an hour until the next available ferry. This one happened to be going to the far side of the island but that is no problem as you can walk around to the other port for the return leg. You may return from either port and you simply turn up and wait with the crowds for the next available ferry which run every 20 minutes. There is a lot of pushing and shoving but this is something you have to get used to in China. The island itself is very nice. There are restaurants all over. Make sure you head to the top of Sunlight Rock to say you have truly been to Xiamen!
Do visit Gulangyu!!!,"We had a fabulous day on Gulangyu. If I visit Xiamen again, I will definitely stay on Gulangyu. Loved its narrow windy streets and the history, the architecture and buildings, the parks, the museums. Food was good too and the ferry trip there and back was fun."
A must visit heritage site!,"A trip to Xiamen would not be completed if you skip visiting Gulangyu. This place is filled with historical sites during the settlement of Gulangyu island during the early 1900s. There is a quaint piano museum that you should visit as well. The buildings on the island were designed by foreign settlers that came to Fujian to work or build their businesses. It's a short ferry ride to Gulangyu and as there are no vehicles on the island, wear comfortable shoes to explore the island. Lots of beautiful photo spots around so don't be afraid to explore!"
Noisy but nice island ,"The number of people visiting this island is humongous, and the boat I took to go to Gulangyu was packed with people. I had to endure several minutes of hustling due to the enormous number of people waiting to board the ferry. The climate there is quite humid. The island has a lot of shops, from Tea Shops to Umbrella shops. When walking down the street, I saw many people holding the same umbrella as mine. The island offers cozy restaurants to relax and eat. However the day I went it was raining and the maps built to indicate the location of the city and to indicate where the map was were imprecise. I spent 5 minutes trying to look for the toilets.So overall, good island. Give it a visit!"
Nice buildings,Great to stroll around. But buy ferry tickets in advance to avoid crowds. Remember to go to DONGDU ferry pier to board boat if you're not a local.
Great days outing,"We spent the day on Gulangyu Island and I really enjoyed it. Note that foreigners need to go to a specific terminal to cross to the island. It‚Äôs about a 15 minute cruise. It‚Äôs probably a good thing to book on line before you go, which we did not, so it took about an hour to process and board. Once on the island, one can walk most places, but there is a LOT to see and plenty of people. It gets really busy in the middle of the day with tour groups, but they do arrive at a different ferry station. Also note that there are no vehicles on the island, except electric golf carts. You can do a trip around the island on one of these, there are 3 stopping points. It‚Äôs not really worth it, as you cannot really see that much, better to walk everywhere. They only go around the shoreline.I would suggest that you consider sleeping in the island, so that you can experience the island without all the day visitors. You will need some sort of plan to explore the island, unless you get a guide. It‚Äôs also probably worth downloading a map or having one on hand, so that you can find all the spots you want to visit. The island is a warren of lanes and roads. Most enjoyable day. The return ferry is included in the ticket. You do need to pay an entrance fee for some of the places"
Overrated,"The island is a nice place to relax considering that is one of the few palaces in China where cars have no access. The sea area is nice and  clean, while on  the main Streets it's only possible to find very touristic shops and nothing more. If you've  been to Xiamen, Gulangyu is like a big Zhongshanlu. Restaurants and hotels on the island are overpriced. The island is very small and you can walk all around the coast is one hour and a half. Pay a visit to the mountain and enjoy the view of Xiamen (if the weather is nice)"
WIsh I can stay there forever!,"Beautiful island with so many colored flower and colonial type building.   The weather was good during our visit, many couples snap their wedding photo there.  I really wish I can spend my entire life on this beautiful place."
Classic European building mix dotted about,The beauty of this little island lies within the streets and allies and not so much the view from the island. You can reach the island from Xiamen. The ferry runs every 20 minutes and the journey is barely 15 minutes. Cost range from US$4.5 - 6.0 for the return tickets. There are lots of boutique B & B housed in some of these amazing architectures. We stayed in Hong Tang at US$38/night. It's a tasteful conversion of a beautiful 1930's brick house with lovely gardens. Two or three nights will be adequate to explore the island in a relaxing manner. Some do day trip depending on the kind of holiday you want. There are local specialty dishes such as stir fried rice noodles and oyster omelette. Dishes are very cheap unless you go for fresh seafood through and through. A hidden little treasure is at 83 QuanZhou Road. We discovered on a Sunday night this local dance club where the lovely old folks gather to play music and dance. So quaint and sweet. They are so chuffed by the spectators. We enjoyed this 4 days/3 nights short break much.
Piano Island,"Due to its colonial history, this island is also known as ""Piano Island"" and it has a long and interesting history. This is one of those favorite tourist attractions around Xiamen and it will not disappoint.You should set aside the best part of a day to visit the island as you will have to catch a ferry there and back and the ferries run a few times a day.This island gives you a very good glimpse of the history of the area and the succession of colonial powers who dominated the area during the last few hundred years."
Must see,No cars on the island. Only walking and bicycles.  Good walking to the top of the island for the scenic spot.  Highly recommended.
Heritage buildings ,A nice place to view heritage buildings and to the different styles of buildings they have on the island! Worth a walk around the place and enjoy the lovely sea breeze! Check out the lovely souvenir stores and the sea produce!
Visit to the island,The ticketing procedure can be tricky here. We booked our tickets through internet and the staff at the booth could not find our records. We showed her our confirmation slip in our hand phone but she refused to look at it as she claimed she does not understand English. We persisted and she tried checking using other numbers and eventually found our records after gruelling 35 minutes. Good thing we reported early at the ferry terminal. On the island we met with very good guide and overall the trip turns out to be fun
DIG deeper and see more.,"Lots of heritage buildings, don‚Äôt just walk surrounding those two piers, dig deeper. You would find lots of old houses and buildings, ABANDONED P0RN among those small alleys. It has two tunnels which might be former air raid shelters, there are some sealed exits with big chip, saw some blankets and daily life objects, some people might be living in those rooms."
Great walking tour to see old buildings and to taste traditional local food,"For those who can walk and climb steep slopes, be prepared with good walking shoes. For those who cannot walk much, you can hop onto buggies at the Ferry Terminal which have stops at strategic spots for you to look around and hop on to another buggy back to the ferry point. Around the island there are many food and drink stalls. There are restaurants which serve very good seafood at reasonable prices. For tourists, better to go on a weekday as weekends are crowded and go during cool Spring season as it can be very hot during Summer"
Fascinating island,"Worth the day visit to the island to see how early merchants built their little mansion compounds away from the mainland. Several lovely gardens and old restored houses. If you are in good shape you can easily walk around the island. If not in great shape, know there are hilly walks in several places. The ferry over there can be very crowded with *lots* of pushing to get on, so be a little wary of the boarding process and the rush to get to the rails to see the view during the crossing."
a little crowded,"a nice day trip, but seems to be a crowded island, nice view in the Shuzhuan garden. you have to get on the battery car, or you will feel it's too tired to finish the walking"
"A beautiful island called ""GuLangYu""","This winter vacation, I went to a small island called ""Gulongyu"" with my parents. It's in Xiamen and not far from Jinmen. You have to take ferry to go there, it costs 38 yuan per person.     The island is small but beautiful. The environment on the island is quite good. There aren't any cars on the island. You can walk around the island in a few hours. There are several beaches on ""Gulongyu"". The sand is wonderful. I had a lot of fun there. I suggest you to go there.The food on ""Gulongyu"" is delicious. There were many seafood and they were super fresh. The thing I liked the most is the big mangoes. They were pretty sweet and tasty. You can try it.     All in all, I had a great time on ""Gulongyu"". It values a lot to go there."
Facing the sea,"I have a house, facing the sea, with spring flowersFrom tomorrow on, I will write to every family memberTell them of my happinessThe happy lightning told meI will tell everyoneGive every river and mountain a warm nameWent to the beach.Occupied the blank beach, suddenly the bottom of my heart aftertaste that poem. It seemed that the sonorous roar of the sea was coming nearer and nearer from the surging tide. The closer I got to the sea, the more real this feeling seemed, as if the sea had really swallowed the sea -- I was facing the sea, the real seaNot far away has been happy over the waves of the crowd blots out the sky to cover the full, under the billowing, the tide is far less than the human tide, the sand between full of color, slanting sandals in the sand or the waves turned over the clothes, bright to cover the monotony of the sand itself, leaving is a person nostalgia colorful. He took off his shoes and socks, burying his feet mercilessly but enthusiastically. Is the rough texture, as the sand personality, rough. Compared with the sand, the sea is gentle, but it is indisputable, only a slap, the place is inclusive is big, overbearing to occupy a side of the sand, and even the indomitable rock barrier. With soft ke gang, soft and firm together, perhaps this is also the yellow and blue could be so fit the reason. Back against the sand, facing the sea.  Maybe that‚Äôs what I just want on this trip"
Gulangyu Ferry - Some Advice - March 2019,"I visited Gulangyu more then ten years ago, and in those days, visitors could travel to the island using the Xiamen Ferry Pier  on Lujiang Road (near the Zhongshan Road walking street.) This is no longer allowed. It seems only holders of Xiamen City residents' cards can now use Xiamen Ferry Pier.All other visitors (whether from China or overseas) must use the International Ferry Pier, which has a dedicated Xiamen/Gulangyu pier (XiaGu Ferry Pier). This pier is located in the Dongdu District 4km NW of the Xiamen Ferry Pier.All travellers need ID. Foreigners will need their passports, and cannot use the ticket machines, but must queue up at the booths to buy a ticket. [I'm not sure if tickets can be bought online -I never checked].You will be given a choice of 35 or 50 Yuan tickets - some seating difference I think - but I bought the 35 Yuan tickets. Ferries are about every 20 mins, but there may be a backlog at busy times. These are RETURN tickets - but nothing tells you that.....You need  to keep them with you for the return journey.After purchasing tickets, you go through security, ticket check/passport check into the large waiting area. This is comfortable and has a Starbucks and washrooms.About 15 mins before your ferry time the gate will open. Queue up and tickets will be scanned again. You go down into an uncomfortable and crowded queuing area. There will be a rush for seats when gates open. Try to stay out of it! It's only 20 mins of standing, there are straps to hold like on a metro system. These ferries go to a newish pier on Gulangyu called the Sanqiutian Ferry Pier, north of the residents ferry pier.For returning, as I said keep your ticket... The tickets are scanned again on your departure  (seems they are valid for 20 days which is useful to know if you are staying in a hotel on the island - but I coudn't see any guidance in English on that subject).The two days that I visited I left the island after 6pm. The ferry did not go to the XiaGu Ferry Pier, but to my surprise went straight across to Xiamen Ferry pier only 5 mins away. That was good for me as my hotel was there. I'm not sure if that is the same all day, or only after 6pm. Once again no guidance available on site!As for the island, a bit over commercialized in the centre compared to 10 years ago, but outside of the town, pretty much the same, and still many empty and derelict mansions /residences but a few more are shops and hotels now. Worth a visit, but be patient. It's a major attraction for tour groups and wedding photographers and you will find it crowded at times."
Nice day trip (but please start early),"Nice day trip from Xiamen, but please start early to avoid congestion at ferry terminal.Tourists will need to go to a specific ferry terminal to take ferries. So aim to take the first few ferries of the day to avoid congestion at late morning.Very touristy island, but a big place to wander around and see the various places.Suggest to buy the tickets online to gain access via QR code.Although can buy on site."
The best thing to do in Xiamen!,"This was a charming oasis of calm during our China adventure.  It's very easy to grab a taxi to the International Ferry terminal and get a ticket for 50 cny per person.  Definitely go directly, do not go via any travel agency who tells you that you need to book tickets in advance and pay through the nose for this, there is no need.  There is a Starbucks at the terminal so you can enjoy a black tea latte on the way to the island.It was a hot and hilly, with a lovely beach and gorgeous parks.  This island was formerly Canton (site of former western trade), so there are a number of charming colonial buildings, lovely architecture and terrific views over Xiamen and the island.  Do get the ticket and take the time to climb up to the highest point on the island - Sunlight Rock, it was fantastic!"
tourists love to come here ...,"This is a good place to spend a day away from cars, buses and motorcycles. Cannot recall seeing bicycles either. Only motorized vehicles are buggies to transport tourists."
Want to learn about history and taste local delicacy?,"It is a very inexpensive way to spend a day of walking, sightseeing, and eating!  The boat ride to and from the island is very inexpensive as well."
Must visit when you are in Xiamen,"Great place to visit, make sure you get to the terminal early to buy your ticket.  I went when it was low season, but there was still a crowd.  Plenty of street food and things to buy and things to see."
Musical island,"My son who lives in Shenzhen took me to Xiamen and we spent most of a day on Gulangyu.  Winding streets, European architecture, churches, street food and a piano museum.  Very enjoyable. We took one ferry over and a different ferry to get back to Xiamen."
Great Respite from Bustling Xiamen,"This world heritage, pedestrian only island is located very close to Xiamen city. Well preserved architecture left over from colonial times (1840's onwards). Full of small lane ways, small shops and cafes.Very very popular with local tourists. Suggest to go mid week to avoid as much of the crowd as possible and to soak up the atmosphere unhindered. Is worth spending a day or overnight if you have the time and wish to slow down for a brief period.Ferry is cheap at RMB35 return"
Worth A Visit,"This UNESCO World Heritage Site is full of history & culture.It  is small enough to walk about for half a day. Foreigners leave from a different Xiamen ferry terminal from locals. Be early & dont miss the ferry as the ticket to GLY is time-specific. If you climb up to to the highest point ( Sunlight Rock) , be sure to descend with your group together as there several paths down & you may end up separated."
Mix of old and new,"We bought ferry tickets for 50 RMB at the large ferry terminal at the west-end of Hubin North Road (to kill the 2 hours we had to wait, we went to the area around Yundang Road for a snack and a walk) Gulangyu is an interesting mix of old colonial buildings and a lot of restaurants, bars and shops selling whatever you can imagine. You can easily spent a whole day here. The fact that it is car-free (except for the golf-carts transporting tourists along the main road) adds to its charm."
Island,"Just an island with beach and many restaurants. Not so excited for us. Ticket for entrance can be bought at ticket counter at ""xiagu"" ferry terminal. We bought 50 rmb for just only an entrance."
Worth checking it out,We tried to check it out ourselves by walking around the island and found ourselves eating a lot of snacks and street food along the way. Ferry tickets could be bought from both piers either in the city or outside city parts of Xiamen. There is a very nice brewery on the island which served cold and awesome beer.
A walk thru time,This island is a fascinating place for history buffs. Its influenced heavily by Dutch raiders and holds the most former embassies in one location close to each other I've seen yet. It's more of a shoppers place and the prices are higher than the mainland but some items are not so easy to find on the mainland. A bit crowded on the ferry ride to and from the land and keep an eye out for back alley sellers making you think the items they sell are a secret and worth more.
Gulangyu island,"I've gone to the island a few times.  A lot of shopping, sightseeing, dining and ability to walk around and unwind.  It has changed over the years as the ability to buy cheap knockoffs has diminished, but you can still find some good deals. When you go to the port to get the ferry ticket, you'll need your passport. When buying the ferry ticket, you have 2 options.   The more expensive ticket drops you off further from the shopping area, but it is a pleasant walk.  The cheaper ticket gets you dropped of nearer to the shopping area.Nice way to spend an afternoon."
"Absolutely beautiful, well worth the visit!","Fantastic mix of architecture, an easy walk around the island.  You could pick up a map and you can find some attraction that interested you.  Also plenty of restaurants and snacks along the way.  A place easily spend 1/2 day if not longer. Highly recommend to visit!"
Well preserved interesting historical island,"You need a guide to explain the history of the building and sites as you walk around the island. After all, it is an UNESCO world cultural heritage site. Getting there by ferry is also part of the fun as you enjoy the sea and skylines of Xiamen. The island is well preserved with many big mansions, small street that have vendors selling local food and snacks. Take time to walk around the island and sample some food. May be drop in for a cup of tea in one of the shops."
Perfect island to visit if there is lesser crowd,"We have a local friend who bought the ferry tickets online for us, which only left the afternoon 3:30pm departing time. Since it is on a weekend, she told us it is impossible to get the ticket at the ferry terminal. The ferry terminal at Dongdu is crowded and it took 20 minutes to reach the island. The jetty at Gulangyu last departing time is 530pm but there is another jetty at the other side of the island that operates 24 hours.  Since we have limited time , we decided to walk to the 24 hours jetty. En route we actually wanted to visit the piano museum but by the time we got there, the museum is closing in 30 minutes time. Hence we gave up the plan. We have seafood dinner on the island which is expensive. There are many restaurants and shops selling local produces which you can spend time here to look around. My wife was here 2 years ago and it was less crowded. She stay on the island for a night. There are also many quiet cafes, which you enjoy sipping a cup of tea or coffee and enjoy a relaxing moment but we did not search for one since it was getting dark. This would be a perfect place to relax with lesser crowd If you decide to visit this island. You should come during the weekdays. We have a friend who came a few days before us during the weekday told us it was less crowded. The 24 hours jetty return trip took 5 minutes back to the mainland at another docking point."
Historical architecture delight,Spent one enjoyable day and night on the island. Loved walking around the island and checking out the quite well preserved villas. Many of them are now hotels and I would recommend staying in one as we did. It was very very humid May/June which which I found quite tiring. The restaurants were great. Access via the regular ferries is very straightforward.
A Lot to Learn from Chinese Culture,"Kudos to our tour guide, Sunny! without him, we will not appreciate the island. It was just tiring, so it is a must that you wear comfy shoes and attire. :)"
Nice view but nothing spectacular,"I went to Gulangyu Island in November. The sky is always gloomy in the day time during our 3 days visit in Xiamen. Our tour agent has help us to purchased the ferry tickets for us.There's always lots of people lining up to wait for the ferry from and return to the Gulangyu Island. The island has nice view and suppose to be a relaxing place but due to lots of tourists scattered around the island, those relaxing and refreshing feeling are gone! I would advise that you just walk around the island. No need to purchase any package that are offered by the tour agent. We bought the package for 3 attractions entrance for RMB150 per person. There are not much stuff to see actually."
Gulangyu Island,A senic iland in Xiamen China Have plenty of seafood restaurants and a cave museum with clay figures.
Popular Piano island with European architecture,"Gulangyu is a island 20 min ferry ride from Xiamen Dongdu International Ferry Terminal. It used to house an international settlement, hence the European architecture.Island is very popular. Tourists and non-locals must take ferry from the farther Dongdu terminal. Go early to get the tickets. We visited in Nov, reach the terminal at 7 am and managed to buy the 7.30 am tickets. Ferry departs every 20 min. 35 RMB per ticket. Online purchase possible but with Chinese payment system.Island is not very big. Good for half or one day tour. Key attractions include the Riguang Rock (offers beautiful view of island and xiamen, very crowded), Piano Museum (surprisingly interesting, even for non-musicians like me) and Hao Yue Garden (stone statue of Zheng Chenggong). There are also some nice beaches.Island has no cars. So be prepared to walk.After 5.30 pm, all visitors can take the local ferry to the more conveniently located ferry terminal near Zhongshan Lu."
3rd visit,"Nice views , but needs cleaning up.The restaurants and snack boothes  thereOvercrowd the place , vendors are too agressive"
A pleasant place to spend an afternoon,"Full of Chinese tourists and very few Westerners. This is a pleasant place to stroll, snack / dine and shop. Very well kept and clean with sandy beaches and some interesting architecture from its heyday between the wars.The ferry terminal for tourists is the main one that is farther from the Island. It is worth taking the longer ferry ride that circles the island. You can return by a shorter route that drops you close to the main downtown eating streets."
Spectacular Island,"Gulangyu Island is a beautiful island, so quiet and small, but you need a whole day to visited it. There are a lot of restaurant and the mountain on the island you really have to visited!"
Great Place to Visit,Small alleys roads and plenty of foods. But cost more than normal city. Tourist area. Take ferry for luxury $50 yuan 2 ways. Try to stay on the island if possible as many area to cover.
Wasted time!,"We booked a ticket surrounding the island for 158 Yuan. We spent one hour on this slow vessel! Then we walked through well maintained  parks along the coastline and turned left into the center of the island - disappointing!Past a large cimetary and through a small food, we ended at a tunnel to get to the port.Some villas were in a good condition, others badly need renovation.Getting back to the mainland was rather chaotic:First, we had to wait a while on a ramp for the ferry. When it finally arrived and the gate was opened, People pushed recklessly from behind, no good management!Fortunately, no accident happened while the mass of impatient Chinese visitors behaved like a flock of agitated sheep. All passengers made it easily on bord, no reason for this peculiar behavior.The trip back took only 10 minutes."
Perfect with toddlers ,Although for you to get there takes effort it‚Äôs worth it. We took a taxi as we were staying a little far and was reasonable but getting the tickets I head out to there was the problem ( got sold out quickly despite was on a Friday) we had to wait at east 2 hours . Luckily there are restaurants on the same place so we had to enjoy a meal as we waited. We got the ticket for the half island and worked well as we took a car that took us round for about 30 Rmb and we saw the beach and all other places till the entrance of the place of the aquarium. You have to walk back which is not too far and good for you to see lots of things. Will definitely return .
Great place - Great Lobsters!!!!!!,"We arrived at the island in the evening. We headed to the hotel right away, but it was hard to find it because the streets were very complicated. After we unpack our belongings in the hotel, we went to the night market to eat dinner. Lobsters were very cheap and delicious: it was the best lobster that I had. In gulangyu, cars are not allowed to drive in, so there weren't any cars on the island except small tour buses. I really liked it because I didn't have to be careful of cars. We also went to the piano museum on the island, and we saw many different kinds of pianos. In general, I really liked the island, and I would love to visit it again."
Well worth a visit,"I took a bullet speed train from Shantou to Xiamen on 30 Sep 2018. The first thing I did was to go to the ferry terminal to purchase a ferry ticket to Gulangyu. I was worried that I could not get a ferry ticket as the following day was the very first day of the Golden Week (1 Oct is the National Day of China). The ferry ticket counter girl told me that during the golden week, there will be no advanced booking of the ferry tickets and all customers have to book their ticket online. I told her that I am from Singapore and would not be able to pay online as I do not have any bank account in China. She spoke to the supervisor and subsequently advised me to come early the next day to buy the ticket over the counter. I could only purchase tickets that customers decided to cancel. So, the next day, I arrived very early at 7 am and fortunately, there was a `rejected' ticket and I was on board the ferry at 7.30 am to my beloved island of Gulangyu. The ferry ticket cost me RMB 35. Gulangyu seem like the old day Sentosa where you could take the ferry across from mainland Singapore and the journey took only 5 mins. Sentosa is now connected to the mainland by road and it would save all the hassle if Gulangyu can similarly connect to the mainland by a road or a bridge. I like this Gulangyu island. No vehicle ply on the island. It is full of greenery and the atmosphere is calm and tranquil. It is a good place for recuperation and ideal for retirement. I strolled and wandered my way through narrow alleys and streets taking my leisure time to admire the sea view, visit the many museums and appreciate the many old western architectural style of houses built in the 20s or 30s that were studded all over the island.I made a mistake for not buying the combo ticket at the beginning and ended up paying RMB50 for just one entry into Sunlight Rock. The combo ticket is just only RMB 135 and it covers the significant `Must See' 5 attractions:(a)  Sunlight Rock (Êó•ÂÖâÂ≤©)(b)  Shuzhuang Garden including Piano Museum  (Ê∑ëÂ∫ÑËä±Âõ≠)(c)  Haoyue Garden (Zheng Chenggong Statue) (ÁöìÊúàÂõ≠)(d)  Gulangyu Organ Museum  (È£éÁê¥ÂçöÁâ©È¶Ü)(e)  International Engraving Museum ( ÂõΩÈôÖÂàªÂ≠óÈ¶Ü) Do not repeat my mistake. My sincere advice: Go early and buy the combo tickets and cover these 5 star attractions before you go further. The views at these 5 attractions are spectacular. For the Sunlight Rock, go in the evening so that you can see the sunset. There are also many titbits tasting opportunities when I roamed the pedestrian streets lined with rows of shops and eateries. The shops were meticulously decorated and artistically well designed and you feel like you are in wonderland. There are also a sizeable number of museums. Gulangyu boasts the world largest organ museum. There is a museum dedicated to Koxinga, a Ming admiral who defeated the Dutch in a maritime battle and drove them out of Taiwan and Gulangyu. There is also the John Ma's museum (a pioneer coach in Modern China Sports); the Wax Museum, the Underwater world museum, the Gulangyu Museum (display exhibits on the history of Gulangyu)I think it would take 2 full days to explore the whole of Gulangyu. If I have the luxury of time, I would just stay overnight on the island and continue to explore her the following day. Gulangyu was designated a World UNESCO Heritage site in 2017. The island is impressive, just so filled with history, culture and buildings and abundant with attractions. It is deserving the title and the exploration on the island is just so leisure in this traffic free loving environment. Do not miss this island if you are in Xiamen. I would say you have not been to Fujian Province or Xiamen if you did not visit Gulangyu."
Great day out!,Great place to walk around and explore. The architecture is superb.Climb to the top of the mountain (temple) to get breathtaking views of Xiamen
Very Nice Visit .. Crowd Alert,"We visited as part of a tour group. The crowds were incredible to say the least! From the initial Lineup queues, ferry ride and majority of our walking tour we bobbed & weaved. Despite this, I enjoyed the history importance of island and the views of Xiamen. Make sure to leave after dusk as the city lights are incredible."
If you have a free day worth a visit.,"It‚Äôs only worth a visit if you have a spare day to spend. It gets very crowded during the weekends , I do recommended that you book a ticket in advance or else all the tickets for tourists will be sold out."
Nice ireland,"We took the ferry really nice boat then walk around the ireland. better to avoid saturday and sunday, too crowded. When you came back from the ireland (different ferry terminal), near by you have many street food restaurants. great moment !"
Beautiful Island!,"If you plan to visit Xiamen, Gulangyu is a Must Visit destination. They changed the ferry port now and also, if you are foreigners, you must bring your passport to purchase the ferry ticket. No cars allowed in this beautiful piano island. Worth to pay for the ticket to visit the highest point Run Rock - picture perfect island. Ferry cost: CNY 50, Run Rock: CNY60."
Beautiful Architecture....,"Went to this unique place in a gloomy morning and thus managed to get the last minute ferry tickets. Regardless of the drizzling morning, there were many visitors visiting the island too. We  took about ten minutes to reach the island. Soon we saw the crowded tourist who probably reached there early morning. We took the tram ride to tour the island and stop at the Piano Museum somewhere in the Island. From there we took a walk on the other side of the island that filled with Colonial building with beautiful architecture design which hardly be seen in any other part of Xiamen. The building are well preserved and the surrounding area are clean and well kept. Besides, the island also filled with plants and trees which are well trimmed. Many shops can be found here too, dried seafood, souvenirs, restaurants etc. We found one book shop that tugged in a small lane which gives you a sense of tranquility when shopped inside. The whole Island would have been an ideal home to stay if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúintruded‚Äù by  too many Tourists."
Revisit Gulangyu,"The last time I visited was in about 1992 and things are so different now. Xiamen has become a modern city with population more than 4M. We took the ferry from the International Cruise Center. The return ferry changes after 5 p.m. and is much shorter. The Island is well-kept andclean despite so many tourists. There are many snack shops and restaurants. We liked the oyster omelette cooked in front of you. The old buildings are well-preserved and the views of Xiamen are magnificent, especially after dark."
Tourist spot,First difficulty is trying to get tickets to the island. The ferry terminal is really crowded. Go early so you don't miss the boat! The island itself is full of tourists. Many food options available and souvenir shops aplenty.
Unique spot in China,"The pedestrian only island of Gulangyu is understandably the city‚Äôs top attraction.  Even on a weekday, the ferry over was packed with tourists.  With clean beaches, walkways lined with palm trees, and western style buildings, it feels more like somewhere in the Mediterranean than China.  Definitely one of the most unique spots in China I‚Äôve been to that was well worth a half-day trip."
A must visit in Xiamen,"You go Xiamen for tourism you can‚Äôt miss a visit to Gualangyu island, best stay one night and enjoy the all around beaches.The island is full of small restaurants and shops, you can enjoy walking around and see the remain old constructed building made by foreigner who lived the island during the colonies time. There aren‚Äôt big hotels on the island only small accommodations."
Visit to gulangyu,"The visit to the island was interesting. We sat on a tram car to see the nice scenery. But a visit to a shop that sells dried seafood items was disappointing. We bought sea cucumber ,fried fish bones etc .the sea cucumber was very small even soaking for days. Please dont buy anything from those shops."
Lovely day and evening trip,"Came with a friend and we had a lovely time and a wonderful Lobster dinner overlooking the ocean, I have been to Xiamen many times and wish I had come here on past visits. Definitely recommend coming at night as the view of Xiamen is great"
Great place for a quite drink. ,Brought a friend from Brazil here for sightseeing and some quite drinks overlooking the ocean and had a great time.
lots of walking,ferry carries 300 people every 20 minutes. lots and lots of bus tourists. no cars on island. golf cart tour 50 yuan p.P. no English speaking tour guides on island. lots of walking. meutermedia
Great experience,"Gulangyu Island is a great place to go when you visit Xiamen ,from the golf buggy ride , to walking through the streets tasting different types of teas and eating the traditional handmade noodles üçù In market area fantastic!!!Gulangyu Island is very popular, lots of tourists, The ferry ride from Haicang is a short enjoyable experience, once again lots of hustle & bustle ...Enjoy"
Excellent Vist to the lovely island,"We took a taxi from our hotel by the airport to the dock area for boarding the river vessel which takes you to the island.  Although the river cruise terminal building was busy it was quite easy to buy tickets for the sail over to the island, which takes about half an hour.   Did a lot of walking on the island in tremendous heat, but lovely to walk along the shore side enjoying the views, after which heading inland to the centre of the island which has a few shops.  A lovely way to spend the day when on holiday in Xiamen."
A very crowded pedestrian island,Gulangyu is a must go to place in Xiamen. It is only accessible by ferry and it is advisable to pre-book ferry tickets as there is a quota per day for the amount of visitors allowed. The crowd is really insane but this is to be expected in a place like China. Do wear proper walking shoes as there is really a lot of walking all around the island. The island is beautifully maintained and there a nice walks along the small alleys in between some really old homes which had been beautifully preserved. At night it is even more beautiful. But the ferry ride back to Xiamen can be a nightmare and super crowded.
Oh My Gosh! I love this place!,"I love Xiamen and I love Gulangyu Island. What a cool place to just walk around and enjoy the ambience. You feel like you are walking around Hawaii, or perhaps Florida. Beautiful gardens, trees and foliage everywhere. Wonderful old buildings and nice places to eat. And Brides and Grooms everywhere you look, getting there wedding photographs. A really special place."
Nice for a wander - pre purchase ticket,"Gulangyu is a charming little island about half an hour ferry ride from Xiamen mainland - i talk about getting there at the end of this review. I can't say that it's spectacular or anything but still a nice little getaway from cars and mopeds. Several of the reviewers complained about crowds on the island - i actually didn't think it was crowded by China standards. The local government recently implemented crowd control by limiting the number of ferries in a day. Except for a couple streets that was concentrated with food vendors, most of the walking paths were fairly free. What's cool about the island is that it feels like an old park with overgrown trees and vines. There are colonial buildings but these have now been taken over by residents. This makes it quite interesting in its own way. It's not a tourist zone that is only inhabited by vendors during the day and empty by night, but rather a lived-in town where people hang laundry in the courtyards of historic buildings. The organ museum was worth a visit. Getting there was a lot more trouble than we thought it was going to be. Don't go to the terminal without a ticket thinking you can just easily catch a ferry every 20 mins. The ferries used to run from several ports, this has now been consolidated to one.  Things to note: (1) you MUST bring your passport to buy and board, else a PRC ID card; (2) Buy your ticket ahead of time. There are limited tickets, if you haven't pre-purchased your ticket, the next ferry would mean several hours wait. Note that you cannot buy your ticket at the counter for the next day. You can only pre-purchase online. Official site is only in Chinese and only accepts Alipay (which unless you have a China bank account, won't work). We asked the hotel concierge to buy it for us the day before; (3) even if you've pre-purchased your ticket, you still need to budget enough time at the terminal line up at the ticket counter to collect the ticket and go through security. I suggest getting there 40 mins before departure time. (4) you can arrive at one port (e.g. neicaoao) and leave from another (sanqiutian/3 something pier...). Your ticket will grant you a return from any of these ports at any time within 20 days. (5) peak return hours are between 3pm - 5.30pm. I would suggest going to the island early, have lunch, then head back before 3pm to avoid the rush.Overall, it's still worth a visit. Once you get on the island, the vibe's quite laid back and relaxing."
Consumption and food streets,"First as a foreigner you have to get to the international ferry terminal Dongdu cruise terminal which can be reached by bus 51, leaves close from the local ferry terminal. This separation is what I don‚Äòt understand?Anyway, ticket price for the ferry round trip is 35rmb, ferries operate quite frequent, let‚Äòs say every 30-45 minutes approx.The island itself and the narrow streets felt quite crowded even it was a weekday afternoon on a cloudy and rainy day. I mean I don‚Äòt expect there empty streets but it was a bit overwhelming in this right moment. Maybe we just were not in the right mood for the hustle & bustle. So we skipped all the spots and got back after an hour, but also because of the weather. During the nighttime it looked nice and less busy, but we just saw it from the coast of Xiamen.Nevertheless, we assume it‚Äòs the place to see in this area so we guess it‚Äòs necessary to see the island. We wouldn‚Äòt go there again but we are vegetarian what makes the food stands not that interesting (I know, vegetarian tourists here..). It can be interesting if you want to sample different food. This is just our opinion it doesn‚Äòt mean that it is not nice in general. We would recommend others to get there anyway, the buildings etc. might be interesting and nice. If it‚Äòs not your style you‚Äòre back in Xiamen quickly. We just took the ferry to the central pier (not the one going back to the international one, to avoid wasting time)."
lovely little island off xiamen,"wondeful place,abit crowded but great food and fantastic atmosphere. this was my highlight of my trip to xiamen. old western architecture and beautiful scenery"
Book early!!,"We had to book a cruise to get to the Island as the ferry tickets were sold out.(a limited number of people may visit the island per day) so buy your tickets early.  The cruise was long and hot and the international cruise terminal was 35 minutes taxi ride from our hotel.  The Island itself was worth the time spent getting there. Lots of lovely gardens, beaches and buildings.  The Island was spotless as was most of the attractions we visited."
Very crowded and touristy,"We had booked our tickets to the Gulangyu island ahead of time, as we were told that there is a limit to the number of visitors to the island daily.  However, even after having booked our tickets, we did not know that we still have to queue up with the rest of the visitors (who did not book tickets ahead and waiting to buy tickets) to collect our hard copy tickets.  Be sure to carry an ID with you such as your passport if you are a foreigner.  Needless to say, we were shocked to discover that there were at least 200 people ahead of us in all the 10 lines.  As we spoke no Mandarin, it was hard to communicate to see if there was a special lane to just ""collect"" our tickets having already paid and booked prior.  There was also no English language signs.Do note that if you miss the alloted time for the ferry, your ticket is voided.  You cannot board a later ferry if you miss your slot.There is a mad rush to board the ferry as there is no crowd control.  My dad who walks with a cane had difficulty as he was pushed and jostled by the crowd.  The ferry to the island was definitely over crowded.The ferry ride took about 20-25 mins and it was nice to enjoy some breeze.Upon disembarkation, the mad rush continues with no concerns for the elderly or wheelchair passengers.We were shocked to discover that it was so crowded on the island, despite prior booking and crowd control.  There is no map available to show where the attractions are, so we just gravitated towards a tour around the island on a golf cart for RMB50 per person.  If you dont understand Mandarin, you are at a loss because once in a while, the driver would point out an attraction in Mandarin.  There is also no designated walking paths for pedestrains, so the driver is constantly honking her way through the crowd so she can pass.The golf cart tour stops as a mid point where you can hop off to explore the island on foot.  It is near the Shuzhuang Garden.  We got off to visit the Garden.  You can hop on again later provided you produce your ticket (you won't know that if don't speak Mandarin).We have heard about the high food prices and quality of food on the island, so we did have any meals there.In total, we spent about 3 hours on the island before heading back.  Again, the boarding of the ferry was chaotic and disorganized.  We were glad to be back on Xiamen island as the ferry seems overcrowded."
Gulangyu Island,"If you go to visit Xiamen, you definitely shall go to the Gulangyu Island, but be careful!!!In previous years it was super easy to use the ferry to pay an visit to Gulongyu Island, but everything changed 1 or 2 years ago. The island was overcrowded with visitors!The major problem might be if you book one of the hotels at the island, if you are in bad luck, you don‚Äôt get a chance to get a ferry ticket!!!Until today I am not 100% clear how it works recently. All citizens from the Island still can use the old ferry terminal in downtown. Visitors need to use the new ferry terminal and ferry tickets now are limited, so you shall go in the early morning better to catch those ferry tickets. However it is worst to to Gulangyu Island if you visit Xiamen, discover the small roads and small restaurants, stay away from the big restaurants and the crowed, don‚Äôt follow them, get one of the maps to find your way back, discover the Island on your own, as mention the small roads and small restaurants are much better, they work not together with the travel agents! The tourist groups always bring their clients to that huge restaurants, bad service, loud and the food not so good. In the roads you find many food stalls, don‚Äôt even think about to try the BBQ oysters, you get definitely some stomach aches!!!Grilled squid and others so far ok. Be aware that you have to discover the Island by walk, comfortable shoes and light clothe are better, especially at the hot summer season. Interesting is the Piano museum, they got some really rare old piano. Btw. I booked 2 times there an hotel, both hotel belong to the same owner. The hotel is located in one of those ancient buildings, super nice and soft new decorated without to destroy the character of the old building, just beautiful you shall try."
Must-go attraction in Xiamen,"There is not many attractions in Xiamen. Therefore, spending a day-trip on Gulangyu Island is a must if you are travelling to Xiamen. Remember to get on the island by 10:00 in the morning to avoid the crowd. Admission fees are required for all attractions/museums, with a few exceptions, on the island. I did not get into any of them but save the money for a cold drink and a piece of cakes from those Western cafes."
Very pretty location lots to see lots of walking.,"We were taken to Gulangyu Island with local friends, it has so much to see and shops as well. Definitely worth the visit. The queue at the end of the day for the ferry was a bit worrying while waiting on the wharf at the front of the gate and hundreds of people behind us pushing the line as the ferry pulled in, I had two children and had to grab them as we were pushed on the ferry."
Good place to go if you want some good exercise. Don't go in summer though!,"Pretty ironic that a place called ""piano island"" has almost no pianos anywhere. I was imaging I could play pianos all around the island! I spotted one inside a hotel at the top of one hill but as soon as I sat down to play (there was no one around but two hotel workers) I was told to leave since I wasn't a guest at their hotel. The short ferry to get to the island is such a mess and gets pricier every year (was 35/person this year). You're crammed about like cattle which is typical in China. We had some food at a random place, it was overpriced and not good. Great place to walk around for exercise as there are many hills but as with most islands the things there are overpriced. Be prepared to sweat buckets if you go in the summer and the bugs eat you alive! I must've had 50 bug bites on my legs every time I stepped outside despite the bug spray and sunscreen I was covered in."
great place,"an island with no cars, lots of things to eat and seequite a picturesque place... I went in summer, so be prepared for the crowds.. but generally I love the place..would have loved to stay a night there.."
Island lack of human touch,"An Island with some attractions places like museum, old streets, western style buildings however I was impress by the Battery Car Centre staffs attitude were bad, yelled to me as they tired to answering similar questions from tourist, On our way searching the Organ Museum the staff were very unfriendly too; show us the way but not even informed that building was closed for renovation. Avoid going here in Weekend and their public holiday, it is crowded."
One of the must go place ,"If you are in Xiamen for leisure, you could not miss this place. It‚Äôs an island just a 20mins ferry ride from Xiamen. The 2 ways ferry ticket cost you about RMB35, and the ferry runs every 20 mins. You are required to book the slot during departure but it‚Äôs a free and go for your return trip. Having said this, you can walk around in the island without worry when to catching the ferry time. We didn‚Äôt spend much time there but we finished walking on the main old street with snacks and local dishes. There are old buildings left from the past colonial e.g from the British or ex USA embassy building. There is also one underwater world or some museum which required you to buy for entry tickets. Generally it is worth to go!"
Appalling logistics,"Just imagine getting packed into a boat like sardines, hundreds of people being ushered to and fro the pier into a confined space (where you wait for the boat). What‚Äôs on this island is not worth the chaos. I‚Äôd rather spend my time at the Zhongshan Rd walking street"
Timeless Island,Our group of 9 took Viator's half-day tour.  Our wonderful guide Aida booked the tourist ferry and showed us the main sights on this historic island.  It was like going back to the 1930's---very charming!  There were many tourists on this May Day; it was quite warm as well but our guide set a sensible pace and we did not feel rushed in any way.  (I believe she stayed with us over the allotted time.)  So thank you very much Aida for a wonderful experience!
Typical tourist trap,"Getting ferry ticket is a hassle as there is limited seats per ferry. On weekends, tickets get sold out fast. Next you have to contend with hordes of local tourist to board the ferry. Island is really just a park with old colonial style buildings. There are also residents on site so you basically see someone's house lol. Every attractions on the island are charged separately and that can add up to quite an amount (there is a combo tix for 3 fixed attractions). Island is not big but since there's no car allowed, walking can take a toll especially during hot summer so bring your hats & brolly."
A short ferry ride,This island has a lot of religious history represented by the many churches found here!  The ferry ride is very scenic while crossing the water between Xiamen and Gulangyu.This is a fun activity with or without family or a group of friends!
Not worth the time and queues,"If u have been to western countries, there is nothing special about the buildings there.I also hate the way the management makes money from tourists there.  Compared with the fact that i just needed to pay a few rmb to get to the island a few years ago, it's a rip-off to pay 50 rmb for a round trip composed of two 15 min rides on an overcrowded ferry."
Tourist everywhere!,Its a tourist island I can say. Do not suprise that at the Ferry Terminal you can see a lot of local tourist therefore please come early to buy the ticket. Came at 10am and we only can get the 1210pm ferry. You will be approached by the local guide there (100Yuan) to bring you to the tourist destination. But I skipped it cause I prefer privacy. You have to pay for the entrance fees for most of the places. The seafood there was fresh and not so expensive.
No 1 sightseeing place of Xiamen ,"It‚Äôs AAAAA certificate sightseeing place of National Tourism Bureau, you can walk to the tourist crowd sightseeing place likes Sunlight Rock and Shuzhuan Parker, but I suggest you walking in the small streets and see the historic villas if you‚Äôre free, you can get the quiet place of real Gulangyu island."
Worth queueing for.,We visited Gulangyu Island during the Chinese New Year which is a very busy time for tourists. The queues at the ferry terminal were massive but somehow once we got onto the island we found some lovely peaceful spots to sit down and enjoy the surroundings.There are no cars or motorcycles allowed on the island so everybody walks at their own pace and there always seems to be place to eat or rest just when you need to. People seem to be more relaxed and contented than on the mainland. Definitely worth a visit even if you have to wait a while for a ferry.
Too many tourists,Tourists must go to the ferry port 5Km distanced from Zhongshan street. Get the ferry ticket in busy season is virtually impossible. Local people doing business with the ticket. The island offers lots of historical sites to see but the number of tourists spoils everything.You never have silence here. The food street is awful with tons of garbage.Is this a unesco heritage? I can‚Äôt agree.Â§ßÂ§â„Å™Êï∞„ÅÆË¶≥ÂÖâÂÆ¢„Åß„Éï„Çß„É™„Éº„ÅÆ„ÉÅ„Ç±„ÉÉ„ÉàÂÖ•Êâã„ÇÇÂ§ßÂ§â„ÄÇÂ≥∂„ÅØ‰ΩïÂá¶„ÇÇ‰∫∫„ÅåÊ∫¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÇ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ‰∏≠Â±±Ê≠©Ë°åË°ó„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„Éï„Éº„Éâ„Çπ„Éà„É™„Éº„Éà„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„ÄÅÂ§ßÈáè„ÅÆÈ£≤È£üÂ∫ó„ÇíË¶ã„Çã„Å†„Åë„ÅßÈ£üÊ¨≤„ÅåÁÑ°„Åè„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇÂªàÈñÄÂÅ¥„Åã„ÇâÁú∫„ÇÅ„Çã„Å†„Åë„Åß„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇ
Average trip,"Ferry tickets: Foreigners cannot buy ticket in advance. You can only purchase on the day itself. Ferries are every 20 minutes. However, be prepared to wait up to 2 hours for your ride as tickets are mostly booked up by tour groups etc. If you want to buy in advance, you'll need someone who is a Chinese citizen to help.The island itself is very crowded. Recommend paying RMB50 for the buggy service. I only visited the piano museum. Worth it if you are interested in the history of pianos. It has an extensive exhibition of pianos from the early days. Food is expensive, which is usual for tourist spots. Recommend not to go on weekends."
Overrated,"Very crowded island, advertized authenticity lacking everywhere. It is picturesque, but pretty much a tourist trap (Chinese tourists seem happy enough). Fun to be there though, only after discovering that foreigners are not allowed on the 10 minute ferry ride; you must use the one hour scenic trip from the cruise terminal. Book timely! Return journey can be by ‚Äònormal‚Äô ferry."
Disappointed tour,"I buy a VIP tickets to take the ferry here but no seat to sit.  Full of people in the island, noisy, dirty here."
Exotic Island,"It is located not far from Xiamen and it only takes you 20 minutes ferry ride to reach. Upon arrival, you can hire a local tour guide at RMB100 for your trip regardless how many group members you have. He/She will lead you to tour the whole island. I have spent half a day with a group of 20+ pax with only one tourist guide and it was considered very cheap and informative."
Well worth the visit,"Getting to the Island was confusing as all the signs are in Chinese, and also VERY few Chinese speak ANY English at all. The main departure point for the Island is from the International Cruise Terminal - where some signs indicate the Gulangyu Island  booking desks. There are three prices quoted with explanations only in Chinese, but it is Y50 for the plain ferry return tickets, and higher prices of approx Y136 and Y236 if you want a guide (in Chinese of course!). When you get there the island is very well signposted with English subtitles, so you cannot get lost, so a guide is unneccessary.Having gone through security and passport control it becomes a little confusing as there is no mention of Gulangyu Island, only the jetty the ferry goes to - Nei Cuo Ao.Any map you get will invariably be in Chinese, and confusingly, on all of them, north is in the bottom right hand corner!There are three ferry jetties on the island, Nei Cuo Ao on the western side (the one you arrived at) and two others on the eastern side which have much shorter crossings to downtown Xiamen (in the vicinity of the large and colourful markets area).Whether you can use your return tickets from any jetty, I do not know, but all the ferry services are operated by the same company.You will need at least 5-6 hours to ""do"" the whole island, including Sunlight Rock and Shuzhuang Gardens."
"Too crowded, lost its charm","We re-visited Gulangyu in March 2018.  The whole place was so crowded and touristy, with so many shops and food outlets that we found it was no longer the tranquil and charming islet when we first visited 15 years back.  We got there and back via the new ferry terminal which is further away from the island which meant longer traveling time of about 30 mins.  Understand the old terminal which is directly opposite the islet (10 mins by ferry) is still operating but meant for Gulangyu residents only.  If you have limited time just give it a miss."
Overly commercial but still quite fun to walk around,"3rd time visit, went with a few colleagues who hadn‚Äôt gone before. Very crowded, lots of tourist, lots of snack stores (pricy and not delicious). They have lots of construction going on. It‚Äôs still worth a visit if you haven‚Äôt been there before as some of the architectures are amazing!"
Good if you have extra time,"This was fun to visit but if you don't make it, you won't feel like you missed out either. Definitely, virtually no one spoke English but it wasn't a problem at all. People were very kind. The ferry over is very crowded but it's also very short so no big deal. It's nice to walk around the island and see the architecture and gardens."
amazing,"amazing little island..beautiful architecture, a pleasure to walk around, climb the hills and look over the city"
Day trip,"The experience of getting on and off the island was enough to put me off. It is so packed and you get herded around like cattle. The island itself doesn‚Äôt have too much culture, most attractions are man made. As a fan of historical sites I found that quite disappointing. Nice place despite the disappointments, just from my personal dislike of crowds it was unpleasant for me. I would also like to point out this was on a Saturday."
If your in Xiamen you must go to Gulangyu,Gulangyu is a respite from the busy city - nice boat ride and nice long or short walks around the island.  walk along the beaches and enjoy the Dutch architecture.  Say hello to some of the western minded older Chinese people and enjoy the local businesses/art work/food etc.  If you come to Xiamen and you don't visit Gulangyu you missed the best thing to do.
Gulangyu Island is the Closest Island to the Taiwan Province,"Gulangyu Island is the closest island to Taiwan Province, and it was where the Chinese Communist Party tried to attack Taiwan during the 50 and 70 era when Taiwan and China were constantly at war.Nowadays, the ancient writings on the Taiwan side says ‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ª‰πâÔºåÁªü‰∏Ä‰∏≠ÂõΩ in Tranditonal Chinese Characters, while the writing on the Chinese side says ‰∏ÄÂõΩ‰∏§Âà∂ÔºåÁªü‰∏Ä‰∏≠ÂõΩ in Simplified Chinese Characters. It is a symbol of ancient stalemate between Taiwan and China, which nowadays are virtually gone, besides for politicians who are vying for votes.Gulangyu has many remnants from foreign rule during the early stages of the New Republic of China in the heyday of its rule.I enjoyed the ship that travelled from Xiamen to Gulangyu, and loved the seafood and foreign feel when I was traversing the Island, and even heard people playing piano on the island.Though I didn't stay there for a long time, I really liked the tourist friendly environment, and hope to go to Gulangyu again soon."
Not up to my expect,"It's spend one day for this Island, is beauty island, one of destination all the traveller will go, one thing i would gave a suggestion to others visitor, only buy ticket in taobao or others website, buy directly at the counter(visitorÔø•35), because you can only get ferry ticket on day, no seat will be control, one boat are carry over thousand people, and also only around 20mins to Gulangyu."
Pretty little Gulangyu Island,"If you did not visit this place, it means you have not visited Xiamen. This is because everything in Xiamen started from here. It is now a historical and cultural centre. To preserve very bit of history and culture here, the government has make this into a pedestarian only island. There is no car, motorcycle, van, etc. So to really enjoy and learn every pieces of history or culture, you must dedicate 2 days. There are homestay and boutique hotel here. Do not rush through the island, indulge yourself in every part of it. This is also my very first ecoerience to visit the piano museum. And the spectacular garden. In the island there are many shops and really authentic shop thst you cannot find in mainland Xiamen. People there are friendly and do try the local delicacy too."
A RETREAT,"A nice retreat a short ferry ride away from.the hustle bustle of Xiamen. Bobcats allowed so it's all on foot or peddles. Lots of boutique shops, cafes & hotels on the island. Very artistic & quiant. Good to spend a weekend max of 3 nights for me."
Xiamen Must visit place!,I had visited there for half day and i'd say that if i had much more time i'd spend a night there on the island.
"Very busy tourist spot, but worth the trip","You must get a ticket early from the Xiamen International Ferry terminal, and don't let the crowds scare you off.  As with most popular tourist destinations in China, it comes with the crowds, but once you get off the enjoyable ferry ride the crowds spread out and you can explore the island on foot, or find one of the shuttle carts.  I prefer exploring the streets most tourists don't go down.  If you want a snack there are tasty restaurants all over the island as well as snack streets, fruit vendors and more than enough shops on the east side of the island. Head over the island to the west to get to the beach."
Adventure of visiting Gulangyu Island,"Gulangyu Island is extremely popular with Chinese tourists -- and visiting there is a challenge for Westerners. It is worth the effort. The island is beautiful. (While there, we saw 5 different brides walking around in their wedding dresses. We learned that they came there to have their photos taken against the island's beautiful scenery.) The island has interesting architecture -- some buildings dating back to the early 1900s when thirteen countries established consular residences there. There are beaches, gardens, hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops, food stalls and the piano museum.Transportation to the island is provided by ferry boat service. Tickets are sold in the international cruise terminal. Our round trip tickets to the Nei Cuo Ao terminal were 50 Yuan each (about $8). It may still be necessary to bring your passport in order to purchase a ticket. Boarding the ferry boat is a challenge. People rush and push in the hopes of finding seats on the boat. All boat announcements are only in Chinese.The map available from the island tourist office is not very helpful. It is written in Chinese except for a few paragraphs that detail the island's history. However, island signage is in Chinese and English. This really helps non-Chinese speakers to navigate around the Island Ring Road. We were especially interested in the Shuzhuang Garden, which is where the piano museum is located. We had considered climbing up the Sunlight Rock but abandoned that idea.We made a wrong turn when trying to leave the island and ended up lost in the maze of food stalls. We had lost the Island Ring Road and its helpful English signage.We knew what to expect on the ferry ride back -- and were able to get seats.Warnings for Western travelers: - We were unable to locate any Western-style toilets on the island. - Although there is signage in English, we did not encounter people who spoke or understood English."
Leisure trip,"Hello guys today will let u know about the Gulangyu island, it‚Äôs a small island in Xiamen island. The place has got a history to it, and I am sure if you visit you will understand about it. The island is very different from the Xiamen which we see, here the island is the architectural wonder, the buildings back date of 1920& 1930 in here, and are well well preserved, another best part is it‚Äôs a walking street, with plenary of food options as well. The piano museum here is one which I am sure one should visit, you will never get to experience such experience in lifetime always. Their are many things one can keep saying about this beautiful island."
A Must See Place in Xiamen,"A nice place for strolling along the Taiwan Straits with lovely breeze, no air pollutions.  Wear a nice walking shoes if you wanted to hike up their mountain or around the coastline.  When I visited the place 18-20 years ago, it is quiet and nice.  Now, it is filled with vendors and food prices are expensive!  But the place itself is full of historical stories that we can all learn from."
Only go if you really need to!,"Gulangyu used to be a lovely place to visit and enjoy a day strolling around it‚Äôs charming streets, buildings and beaches.It is now the Xiamen equivalent of Blackpool complete with Kiss me Quick hats and ridiculously expensive restaurants and shops all wishing to sell you the same over-hyped and over-priced food and drink. Even when the local government has imposed daily visitor quotas there are still far, far, far, far too many people allowed on the island at any one time and all in the name of pure capitalism.Lovely place, incredible architecture. Totally spoilt."
A must in Fujian province,"A unique island, preserving its old architecture (~18th-19th centuries), no auto traffic allowed, lots of attractions for all ages and tastes.You need to allocate 1 day for visiting it (including the boat trip)."
Getting there is a mission,"There are two terminals for the island and if you are a foreigner you need to go to the international terminal. If at the bottom of walking street catch bus 51 for 1yuan each to get to the terminal. Then you would think the signs would have english as its the international terminal. Wrong. Big lines to get tickets, boats sell out fast, decided after watching the weather to forget it and go somewhere else. As your standing there you will be pushed and shoved as if its the last boat booking of the day.We got the bus back to where we started and walked the waterfront to the old fort, and caught a bus back."
Loved the Island !,During our six day stay in Xiamen we visited Gulangyu Island three times.We walked the circumference every time.
nice but usually crowded,"The best time to visit Gulangyu is during weekdays. If you want to enjoy the place better, avoid holidays and weekends. Its a nice place, mostly with European architecture."
A short visit but nice architectural,"Went to Gulangyu Island in Oct 2017 last year and though it was a very short visit, arrived at night and checked into the hotel, but we met a great uncle Wong, who really helped us all the way back to Xiamen and to our hotel. Ensuring our safety and as guide to show us around in the island. Without him, we would have missed the last ferry back to Xiamen main island too. Should stay 3D2N to fully enjoy this island. Nice place for your cameras."
Wonderful cultural and recreation destination,"Not speaking Chinese, we found many people to help us, even if we didn‚Äôt share a language. Many English speakers were kids, who liked to show their parents what they had learned"
Very pleasant,"My wife and I visited Xiamen for the first time last week.  Gulangyu was a fun place to visit.  It's a walking island with no motorized vehicles other than some tourist busses which are really open air expanded golf carts.  Gulangyu was also called Amoy in times last and was basically occupied by foreign powers in the 19th and 20th centuries for many years.  As such, the main attractions on the island are the many old buildings (built mostly from 1920-1935).  We stayed in a very nice hotel part of a global chain in the Haicang district and walked 10 minutes to the ferry; the ride on the ferry was all of 10 minutes.  We checked a few hotels on the island because we thought we might return someday and considered staying on the island itself.  I would NOT recommend you stay on Gulangyu - your room would likely be twice what we paid at Haicang and the rooms we saw I would rate as 2 or at best 3 stars - not nearly as nice as where we stayed.  Gulangyu is worth a day trip but would not overnight there.  We went on a Tuesday in February.  I'm betting this place is really crowded on weekends and in the summer so would not recommend those times for a visit.  Enjoy."
Gulangyu Experience,The visit to this unique island is a must for those who visit Xiamen. The tea-shops are very much of an attraction and offer good teas to take away with you to home....although slightly overpriced.
Gulangyu!,interesting walk on the island!Need to walk a lot and see the architecture.Only thing i dun like is must pay to go to the highest point for a good look of the island view.Some small cafe around offer a quiet time.many food there at the walking street!But also be prepare to get squeeze while getting onto the ship!
many small ship go to other island. there are,"small restaurant, younger hotel, hotel , night view, at night many one have romantic time.ship ticket be 2, today be 36. can be eat sea food. very wide sea.breathe fresh air.i like sea."
An excellent place to discover some of Xiamen‚Äôs past,"Visited with my wife, in-laws, brother-in-law, his wife and my nephew. First time for all of us and there was something for all of us to see and enjoy. The buildings were a fascinating insight into the past of this lovely island, mixing European, China/European and Chinese styles all into one small island. Some building were quite dilapidated, others not, but this all added to the charm, and it was good to see that some renovation to these beautiful old buildings is taking place so they will not fall into further disrepair.The ferry ride is quick (5-10 minutes) and easy (be prepared to take your passport or ID card as this is needed for the ferry ticket - I‚Äôd forgotten mine, but some sweet talking by my wife persuaded them to accept my UK driving licence instead).We also saw a white dolphin swimming in the strait between Xiamen island and Gulangyu, which was a nice bonus.There are plenty of restaurants and cafes, to suit all budgets along with some souvenir shops and small boutiques.All in all we spent about 6 hours there, and still did not have time to see everything, so would revisit if we visit Xiamen in future."
Lovely stroll around the island,It was interesting to walk around the island and imagine how the people in Gulangyu lived in the past. I really admired the grandeur and architecture of the houses there! ... Many interesting things to do for various age groups!Just be prepared to do a lot of walking as majority of visitors stroll through the winding roads of the island!
Great way to spend a few hours.,"This is a beautiful small island. It is kept very clean. I suggest to visit this on your own rather than a group. Make sure you bring your passport to buy your ferry ticket. Take the 8:50am ferry to go to the island. This ferry can be crowded, but once at the island, the crowd disperses and you can go a different direction. I went there on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded. When you take the ferry back around noon or early afternoon, it is not busy at all. The scenery on the island is beautiful. Definitely check out the Sunlight Rock, which gives you a good view of the island. It's bit of a climb but worth it. You probably won't spend more than 4 or so hours on the island, although you could."
Amazing and awesome!  ,"In love with this island!!  It's very beautiful and the weather was good when we went! One day trip is perfect. The scenery was awesome (photos). Although there are many steep steps and climbing, it was really worth it. Many couples took their wedding shot there. The street food was overpriced though and the queue was very long. Overall,  we enjoyed ourselves very much! Must go when you are in xiamen."
Nice place ,Nice place to have a walk many places to eat restaurant and street food best to walk 10 minutes as the restaurants get cheaper many Chinese tourists but hey we‚Äôre in China no pushing and shoving as some other reviews have mentioned Very clean as is all Xiamen good place to spend the day
"Must visit island, crowded most of the time, go private not tour group.","A must visit Island that seems to have the whole population on the island at any one time! The island is small at around 2 square kilometers and so easily walkable, quite hilly in places though! Lots to see and do, some payable some free, a lot of art deco buildings now in a state of disrepair- shame really. Plenty of street food and many samples handed out. Probably need at least 4 hours to do the essentials but all day is easyily doable. The journey across to the island is somewhat chaotic on the ferry and the terminal is rather confusing, take yor passport or you won't travel!I would suggest a privately arranged tour with an English speaking guide, decide what you want to see on the island when you arrange the tour and get the entry tickets and ferry tickets in advance. To the island is timed tickets, return is open. We actually booked with our hotel concierge and he came with us. The island really is a must but unless you are really brave do not do it on your own, and to get the best out of it go private not on a group tour."
The taipans are gone and the workers have taken over.,"Pretty island with great potential.  It is picturesque and you'll see locals coming for bridal shots.  However, be prepared to put up with the crowd of mainland visitors and endure the queques.It seems a pity that all the original owners of the art deco buildings are gone and are turned into tacky eateries and souvenir shops. You may still see coolies hauling heavy goods on wheel barrows.  Surprising for such a technically advanced nation.   The main shopping street has lots of food stalls and you can have quite a bit of free sampling of snacks along the way."
Nice little island ,"A small island with many attraction and rich history, get prepare with a pair of comfortable sneaker as there isn't any transportation on the Island ."
Top attraction in Xiamen,"This is probably the top attraction in Xiamen. Hordes of tour groups are expected, even during low peak season such as in Dec. The most challenging part is to board the ferry to Gulangyu and back to Xiamen. Expect the rush and long queue.For foreigners like me, the ferry point is at the International Cruise Terminal (Âé¶Èó®ÂõΩÈôÖÈÇÆËΩÆ‰∏≠ÂøÉ). I took a cab from Zhongshan Road, 10 mis ride, 12 rmb. Upon arriving around 08:35hr, I was glad the ticketing counter had no queue. I managed to purchase the 08:50 hr ferry to Sanqiutian wharf (‰∏â‰∏òÁî∞Á†ÅÂ§¥). Ferry ticket is 35 rmb, passport required. I also bought a 100 rmb combo entrance ticket, for entrances to 5 main attractions. This combo ticket can be bought at the ferry terminal as well as in all the attractions ticketing counter in Gulangyu.Ferry ride took about 20 mins. Once I alighted from the ferry, the tour groups started to disperse and head to different attractions. Hence I didn‚Äôt feel crowded as the island was huge.The main and popular scenic spots on the island are Sunlight Rock,Shuzhuang Garden, Haoyue Park, Organ Museum and Piano Museum. Please see my separate review for details.Besides the main attractions, I enjoyed leisurely walking the many lanes, admiring the European-style architecture, churches, etc. Such backdrops were popular for wedding couple photoshoots.There are many restaurants, cafes, streets lining up with stores selling food and snacks in the island. There are also many vendors selling drinks and cut fruits. I bought one stick of mango, 10 rmb, really sweet.I spent almost the entire day on the island. For the return ferry ride, I joined line 3 for the ferry back to Xiamen Ferry Terminal at Zhongshan Road, no need to head back to the International Cruise Terminal.Overall, I enjoyed spending 1 day at Gulangyu island."
European homes,European homes could be refurbished for tourists instead of crumbling. Rather sad state.Lots of public restrooms around Ferry services are rather desperate with people shoving. Old folk can be pushed into the sea.Perhaps more frequent services to cater to swelling demand during peak periods would help
Must visit,"Visited this island with the family,The ferry across to the island is very crowded a be prepared for a lot of pushing and use of your elbowsTake the small bus for a tour around the island.Lots of beaches places to eat.All in all a great day"
Highly commercialised - overrun by rude mainland tourists,"I know Kulangsu gets many great reviews. Reading some of them prompted me to actually go.Yes, the island is picturesque (if you can escape the locust-plague like crowds of noisy mainland tourists). There are many beautiful and scenic spots and lovely colonial and ""amoy deco"" architecture.Getting there and backThis being off season I entertained hopes of a relatively easy way in. No such luck. At quarter past 11 the next available tickets were 13:30. This ticket was 50RMB, but it includes the round trip. While cooling my heels waiting for the ferry I had a great experience at Jacky Angela Steakhouse, which is well hidden at the near end of the endless Chinese restaurants offering seafood that form the ground floor level of the Ferry terminal.The scenes observable when boarding the ferry (also on the way back) will be familiar to anyone who has seen ""Charge of the light brigade"" at the National Army Museum. A most undignified scramble, pushing and elbowing to get on first most unbefitting.That embarking experience was certainly awful, twice. Seeing this is off-season one shudders to imagine what it will be like during peak-season.Kulangsu - a tourist money extracting machineAfter disembarking the ferry you are urgently directed to take an expensive round the island tour in an electric bus. Almost any non-historical building ground floor is some kind of shop, restaurant or street-side food stall. This being off season some of the locations were shuttered, but the noises of hawkers and smells of various foods were essentially inescapable. Off the beaten pathFollowing my usual practice on looking where the biggest crowds go and then going the opposite way I managed a temporary respite and escape, crossing the island across the middle and finding hidden gems like the Chinese christian cemetery and scenic spots opposite from ""sunshine rock"". However once a bit down the slopes I was back in the embrace of the crowds. About two and a half hours of walking around and I had seen enough to make me happy to get the ferry back.ConclusionIf you don't mind Chinese crowds, rudeness and noise and commercialism crass enough to make Americans blush and you are willing to go off the common tourist track, you may still find some of the old magic. Otherwise, unless you have time to kill and nothing better to do, leave this paradise lost to the locust-like invaders that descend daily upon it's shores and instead just go to Amoy's old quarters and try the Shapowei area."
Well worth a visit,"This is a great place for a day out. I wasn't at all sure what to expect as we've had variable experience with 5A tourist attractions. It's easy to get there, just a trip to the International Cruise Wharf from where you take the ferry with 100s of other Chinese tourists. We visited on Christmas Day, a Monday, and there weren't so many people. Once at the island, you'll find a tourist office where you can get a map with the main attractions. The map isn't to scale and the streets are really difficult to follow but it's a very enjoyable place to get lost. The beaches are lovely and the main food area is very lively. There are lots of great old buildings to admire. You can buy a ticket to see the main attractions but if you choose not to buy the ticket, you'll find lots to do. I'd happily visit again."
Bring your passport!,"The Island is a must see if you are in Xiamen: great views, lovely winding streets, cafes, historic buildings, beaches. I just wanted to highlight if you are not on a pre-booked tour, you must bring ID, such as your passport when purchasing your Ferry ticket. I found out the hard way. Be prepared for incredible crowds on the Ferry, but the island is worth it. If you can find space on the upper decks you will have lovely views and photo opportunities. When on the Island, it does not feel crowded at all, it is just the ferry ride."
Had a great time!! Beautiful achitecture,"We spent about 1.5 day on the day. It's a very enjoyable side trip from Xiamen. We enjoyed checking out the old buildings and the scenery from the top of Riguang Mountain.  Note: 1. Book your ferry tickets ahead of time; 2. be sure to take the right ferry, there are several piers on the Xiamen side as well as on the Gulangyu side, one of the lines is only for the residents; check with your hotel concierge if you are unsure 3. go during week to avoid the crowds. 4. dress comfortably, expect lots of walking"
Nice but confusing,"To get to the island aa a foreigner is very confusing. There are new rules just introduced on the number of visitors to the island. And visitors have to use another harbour. It's best to book with another tour agency. However do ask properly. We were put onto a bus that took us sight seeing and only went to island in afternoon. The reason was that we booked late and they can only process the paper work in the morning. So need to book in advance so that they can process and can go to island in the morning. And the entrance fees on island is all separate. I find the entrance fees to attractions very expensive and overrated. Sure it's nice and unique but very crowded.  The island will introduce a one ticket soon, meaning that you pay a sum of money that has the ferry ticket and free access to all sight seeing places. I find that better.  The island is very small, if you don't visit all the sites, can finish in half day. Lots of food stalls too.  Still worth a visit."
A good half day trip to this really small island ...,"Although a little disappointed, nonetheless a great half day outing, way too many tourists, food and shopping very similar to what you get in Taiwan, great bargains on pearls from the area if you know what you are buying, should visit whenever in the Xiamen area."
Not Enjoying,"This is not enjoying journey. I boarded , but the ferry journey was interesting . Other than that there is nothing much interesting things inside the island"
Interesting and relaxing Island,Fabulous little island to visit for the day and early evening! Great evening views of Xiamen lit up also vice versa when you return. Lots of street food and great walking places. beautiful parks and fun to visit. If you aren't happy with eating Chinese Street food return to Xiamen for dinner!TAKE YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU!!! A must.
A great place to walk around!,"Gulangyu is not big, but it is good to spend one night there, so you can get on the top of Ri Guang Yan to see the sunset and sunrise.Take your time, walk around to enjoy the old housesAlso, there are a lot of seafood!"
Cheap day out,Just go to the ferry buy a 50 ¬• ticket (two way) and visit this island of love and many more Nice museum of pianos 30 ¬• and food anywhere
Beautiful Island with very interesting buildings and history,We enjoyed 5 hours on this wonderful island and walked many miles.  The gardens and piano museum were highlights in addition to the architecture and cosy coffee shops.  One side of the island near the closest very to Xiamen is too crowded and the return boat trip is a nightmare . Go early and leave Before 4.30
Don't waste your time.,"If you enjoy huge crowds, terrible, seafood restaurants, and shopping for jewelry, then take the trip. No scenic views, no relaxing beaches, no live music, and no island charm.  It is a low-end tourist trap. I did not have many expectations going there, but it fell way short of the few I did have."
Don‚Äôt visit with young children and the elderly,The queue at the ferry terminal to and from Gulangyu was terribly long and people were pushing their ways to get in and out of the ferry.It is advisable to purchase ferry tickets to the island one day in advance for your preferred departure timing. Please remember to bring along your passport or identity card to purchase ticket. Personally I felt that the island is over rated. I won‚Äôt visit again.
Nice pleasant island - Be prepared to walk a lot ,We came here as part of our tour of Xiamen.  There is a ferry terminal in Xiamen and you need your passport to board the ferry. Tickets were already purchased for us by the tour guide.The ferry ride is about 25 minutes from Xiamen to Gulangyu Island. It‚Äôs a small island and walking only island where vehicles are not allowed. It takes time to walk around the island slowly with beaches and restaurants along the way. There is also a piano museum and an organ museum and a furniture museum.A pleasant trip of about 2-3 hours on this island and time away from the city.
Great Place!,"I was there for one day. As an avid tea drinker, I visited many tea vendors and had a blast. Gulangyu Island is a great place!"
Charmning little island,"A very nice bit of a green hilly place in Xiamen. We went there in the late afternoon, it was a bit of a strange ride - cause we took a taxi from our hotel to the ferry - and it took us around 25 minutes to get there - apparently, it was a special terminal for foreigners (and, yes, don't forget you'll need your passport to buy a ticket) - but it was a 5-minute ride back, to a completely different quay - not that it mattered for us but ... The island is small, 1.5 h is enough to walk around, there seem to be some interesting museums like piano and organ - but they closed at 6 pm, and we were too late. Before the trip to Xiamen, we were planning to book something in a hotel on the island but then opted for Xiamen itself - and were pretty happy with our choice - pretty much all the buildings on the island look terrribly poorly maintained and run-down - and they are 60 years old at the most.Plus, we were going to go to the beach - and so we did, with the exception of swimming in the sea - presumably, it's one of the better beaches in China - and it was atrocious - there were piles of rubbish floating in the water at the shore - it's doubtful it was storm-related - so we didn't dare tread those waters and stuck to the swimming pool in the hotel.The place is unique, it's a nice island park, lots of little shops and street food - it was actually much better than dinner in one of the restaurants - they're just tourist traps, it's a much better idea to just snack on the island and have something much nicer and way cheaper in the city.Lovely place, worth visiting if you're in Xiamen anyway; a bit of breakaway from the Chinese architecture - but not sure how many years before these buildings finally give way to something more... in keeping with the rest.Avoid going there at the weekend unless you enjoy getting caught in the undertow of droves of tourists."
Nothing so special here,"Despite the beautiful sea view, I do not really think it worths travelling so far to visit this place. Some point of view requires tickets to view (and it is not cheap). On Saturday or Sunday, there're some many people here, you cannot stay long on the Êó•ÂÖâÂ≤© to take a full view of Xiamen"
Not sure it's worth the transit misery,"The island is quite large and there's a fair amount to see if you just want to wander and admire the European architecture. There are many galleries and museums, but they all come with an entrance fee. There are also many beaches and endless shopping/eating areas. It's a nice spot to spend a morning or afternoon. However, the journey to and fro can be murderous. It's RMB30 round trip and particularly if you visit on the weekend, you will find the return journey to Xiamen beyond trying and beyond scary. The hordes of locals trying to return on the limited number of ferries creates mayhem and crushing crowds that I found quite terrifying. For some reason, it's in the Chinese pysche that they have just GOT to be first and they don't care who they trample and shove to be the first on the boat. So having waited TWO hours in endless lines just to get to the dock, be prepared to be flattened against the barriers as you are shoved aside. Rather ruins the whole outing."
Lessons Learned,"My father's family originated in Fujian so for past few years, when in Southern China, I combine business with family visits and local strolling as much as possible. The mystique of Gulangyu aka 'music' island, British colonial period, ocean boardwalk, exotic fauna and foliage - tales told for years to me so I finally took a Tues-Wed off during off-peak season for a solo stay over. I speak Mandarin well, traveled and worked in China since 1994 but thought of my family who are 95% English only.  Day 1 was not good; Day 2 was much better.  Top 5 takeaways for western travelers: take ferry before 2 pm going to the island and the morning ferry from the island, no luggage is best, partake of the local food cafes in the main squares but save money and time for the higher roads and less crowds, and make sure you know your way after dark because local merchants are generally not friendly to help on finding roads and such unless you buy something. However, the trip was 'saved' with the amazing private inn my relatives booked for me and the morning stroll on Day 2 leading me to am amazing home converted into coffee shop and cafe.  Check out Phoenix Hotel and the Chu Family Coffee Shop."
"A worthwhile experience, but a bit crowded","Toured with some colleagues on a Sunday.  Ferry wait was about 2 hours, but I heard you can book in advance through a travel agency.   Once on the island there are numerous restaurants and street vendors selling food.  Quote a few shops selling tea, jewelry, and other souvenir items.  We hiked off the main loop a bit to see some of the historical buildings and beat the crowds.  Spent about four hours here including a lunch stop."
Overhyped and hordes of people ,"Ticketing: Try to get your hotel concierge to help you book the tickets so you dont need to queue to purchase it. You cannot book tickets on the day itself online. The 50rmb ticket guarantees a seat, you alight at niecuoer port. The 35rmb ticket allows standing, so seats availability are first come first serve, you alight at sanqiutian port. Tickets on the weekend are hard to grab. We purchased ours on a Sunday, arrived at the international cruise terminal at 1.30pm and managed to get a ticket at 3.30pm.Tip: Print a map of the island with key attractions, find it online. Look at where the hordes of tour groups are going and go another way, usually a small street is better. After alighting at the Port, immediately head off to a street in your mind and ignore Tour guides approaching you. Some are quite sticky. I only managed to brush off one of them after about 5min even after saying no, I just continued walking. Free and easy is more relaxed. Places visited: Zheng Cheng Gong museum, walking along the beach and various small streets and gardens. Didn't purchase any tickets. Spent 2.5 hours. Leaving the island: We left when the sun was setting at around 6pm. After 5pm, all visitors can only leave through sanqiutian port. The crowd was huge. We took around 25min to queue and board. People were squeezing and running up to board the boat. The experience wasn't very pleasant. It might be better to leave mid afternoon or late evening. Overall impression: There are better places to visit in Xiamen and nearby cities like Fujian."
Too crowded,"The worst thing was the ferry ride, people jump the queues and kept pushing, tickets do sell out. On the island everywhere was so crowded, island residents tries to sell some stuff, lots of street food and small shops, but you can find the same shops and everything in Xiamen, there is no point to buy anything on the island."
"Crowded, set up for tourists, interesting architecture ","Xiamen is quite a relaxed city, very different from the hustle of Beijing. However the crowds swarming the ferry to get to the island reminded us of the pushing and shoving we thought we had left behind. The island is quite pretty, just over crowded with tourists. Lots of young newlyweds having their photos taken, everywhere! The piano museum is interesting, the blend of architectural styles is noteworthy, a reminder of colonial times past, and the view from Sunlight Rock is splendid. Get there early, spend no more than a couple of hours then move on. There is so much more to see in Fujian province."
Beautiful island despite being a little overhyped.,"For most people a trip to Xiamen is incomplete without a trip to GulangYu so on my recent holiday it was at the top of my list to visit. When planning your trip bear in mind that you need to get to the ferry terminal early- we unfortunately found out the hard way that outward tickets sell out very quickly and had to return the following day. Also ensure you remember your passport! Once you have your tickets the ferry is around a 20 minute trip from Xiamen. The outward ferry journey is surreal and even features an onboard piano player!Once you arrive in GulangYu there is a lot to explore ‚Äì there‚Äôs of course the statue of Zheng Chenggong which looks onto Xiamen; the piano museum; viewing points; gardens; the beach and endless pretty cafes; shops and snack streets. Alongside this it‚Äôs enjoyable just to stroll through the streets and enjoy the beautiful buildings throughout the island. Despite this, whilst GulangYu is absolutely gorgeous, I was already so smitten with the charm of Xiamen that it wasn‚Äôt the highlight of my holiday and I found it to be a little overhyped. Many of the things so many enjoy about GulangYu ‚Äì the relaxed vibe; proximity the beach and quirky shops / cafes were things that can already be found in Xiamen, particularly in areas like ShaPoWei and around the University which feel less touristy, so I don‚Äôt think I would return to GulangYu again in future. However perhaps this is more a testament to how much I enjoyed Xiamen than anything particularly against GulangYu.Side note: On the return journey you are able to get a ferry from a terminal on the other side of the island to where you are originally dropped off. We didn‚Äôt know this before we arrived but saved it saved us a lot of time!"
Maybe the prettiest place in China,This place is beautiful with lots of interesting places to visit.  There are restrictions on what ferries people that are not locals can take and it is a little frustrating.  The island is also extremely busy with a daily huge crush of visitors.  Make a plan allowing you not to be in a hurry.  When we arrived there were lots of people available to take us around for a very reasonable price.  We were able to see a lot more in the time that we had.  I hope to come back and spend a week on the island.  There are several beautiful beaches and many restaurants to try.
Not practical to get to,"Went during golden week. Firstly, on the webpage (only Chinese) you can only book a ticket with a Chinese ID. Foreigners can not book tickets advance. The only way you can buy tickets is to go to the international ferry terminal that is located outside of the city. There you can I Ou buy tickets for the same days departure, which is really practical since the tickets can be prebooked by Chinese nationals online. Went twice to the ferry terminal just to hear that there are no tickets, didn‚Äôt see the island during a 3-days stay..Very badly organized for foreign travelers."
"A nice island to visit, but mostly a very touristy place","It's an easy ferry ride to Gulangyu from Xiamen.  We booked our flight/hotel last min 2 days ahead, and the weekend before Oct Golden week.  So it's not Golden week, but still felt very crowded and lots of tourists.  They said the week after would be crazy hectic, and they would only let 50,000 tourists in. After that, ppl will be turned away.You can only get there via ferry.  In normal time (non winter month, which is before end of Oct), you use the International Ferry Pier before 6:30pm, and use the LunDu ËΩÆÊ∏° Pier after 6:30pm.  Both will get to the SanQiuTian (‰∏â‰∏òÁî∞) Pier at Gulangyu.  The ticket is 36rmb and it is a return ticket.  There is also a ferry at the same pier at both piers for locals only. Even though it's a short ferry ride (7-10 min), but on a Sat nite, there were lots of people and they made you wait in a cage like waiting dock, for over 20 min before you can get on the ferry.  Also, our flight arrived Xiamen at 4:45pm, and mistakenly we thought the ferry change over time was 5:30 from 1 pier to another instead of 6:30, so we went to the LunDu pier at 5:30, but had to wait until the ticket booth open at 6:30.  the change over was only after end of Oct.  But we didn't know. so it was a long wait at the ticket booth to get tickets, and then a long wait at the cage to board the ferry.  All very unpleasant, and you know what it's like when you have to wait with a large crowd of Chinese tourists, noisy, jostling for personal space and stressful.  But the night view of the skyline was great.  It was a peaceful ferry ride.There are no cars on the island, which is great.  But that means you have to drag your luggage on cobblestone on foot as well.  Our hotel was quite far 20+ min, and up a steep hill.  And in the summer heat of 35+ even at nite, we arrived the hotel drenched.  So be careful where you booked, and how far it is from the pier.We stayed at Gulangyu for 3 nites, 2 days. There are a lot of things to see by just walking around.  We didn't do any tours or group activities, but just walk around the island.  It's advised to go out early, then have an early lunch and have a siesta to avoid the mid day heat, and go out early evening to enjoy the cooler of the day, and night time strolls around the island is just wonderful.There are lots of eateries around the island, but the varieties are mostly similar. We went to ‰∏äÂ±øÊ∞¥‰∫ßÔºå ÊåëÈ£ü, for dinner.  Both served mainly seafood.  The ambiance was very nice for both, food delicious, and not too expensive.  We enjoyed both places.  For breakfast and lunch, we mainly picked diff snacks on the street, actually mainly having beers at lunch by the beach since it was so hot.  Even though the island offers lots of great architectures, and formal and grand buildings from the early of last century to explore, it is still a tourist centric island and everything feels very touristy and artificial. Signs are adequate and some translation to English if that's what you need.Beaches were baking hot at the time, and not so easy to enjoy.  All in all, not too bad a summer escape, but not as relaxing as I expected, which is mostly my fault to have unrealistic expectation."
Visit while working in Jimei Xiamen,"The people are friendly, there're interesting architecture and history as well as many delicious local snacks."
Nice sceneries ,"Was there for a day trip at 30th Oct during China National Day 8 days holiday stretch.Going there(warning: paid extra:( )Reach the ticketing center via Google map and found out that this ticket center would only cater locals. Foreigners would need to take a 51 numbered bus to ticketing station serving foreigners.On the way to the bus, some lady approach me and sold me some inflated tickets at CNY80 instead of the CNY35 if buying at foreigner ticket terminal. Not wanting to risk not being able to get tickets at another station i decided to go ahead with this ticket. They didnt provide ticket at this point. After that pay another CNY2 to get on ferry. Get on ferry and reach yet another ferry terminal. Show ticketing booth your passport to get your physical ticket. This ticket is 2 way so remember to keep it for return.Get on ferry and finally reach Gulangyu Neicuoao Pier . Attractions:Ocean World@north of island@CNY90 Beach@south of islandLots of walking and sightseeingTry to go back late and check out their night lights.Food:Lots of street food here ranging from pork to clams, plenty of drinks inc alcoholic variants, fruits stalls and biscuit to bring back.Return: Go to San Qiu Tian pier located at north of island to get back using your 2 way ferry ticket if going back late.Verdict: Leg breaker and good way to spend a half-full day."
MUST SEE PLACE,"i used the regular ship transport to the island, there was other option which have higher price be careful not choosing them (some ships for 300yuan!!) It is better you go there afternoon (after visiting the Zhongshan Road) because the nights are amazing there."
"Great view, clean and easy to walk","Is a big island, you need to ride a 30 minute ferry to reach this island, cost 50rmb round trip. No car inside the island, if only we can borrow bicycle would be better, but not available so you can only walk. Map is available in visitor service, no need to buy.  Better coming here from morning as the international port only up to 18 pm, after that you have to wait to ride on ferry for the local port. Even better to stay in the island and spend more relaxing time here. There are lots to see, every scenery have different price, payable inside each gate, the sunlight rock is must see, but prepare to climb lots of steps. There are lots of sellers of food, drinks, fruit, and handicrafts inside all accept cash only. The walking sign is pretty clear and in alphabetical, so local guide is not necessary needed."
Horrible and racist,"I can't tell you what the island is like because they wouldn't let us travel to it. We tried to buy tickets, they said they were sold out. Fine, but as we went to left some Chinese tourists tried to buy tickets and were sold them no problem. We asked why, ticket girl said they lived on island. Fine so far again, but then Chinese tourists understood English and said actually no they don't live on the island - they are just tourists also. At this point tourist girl just said she doesn't like selling tickets to foreigners so go away. Horrible and racist."
Gulangyu island,"I liked this island, I enjoyed it there. It's small enough to walk around it in a day. We were there for two days and we done so much. First we went on a tour of the island in a tour bus. It took about half an hour to go all the way around. We went to ocean world I don't know who enjoyed it most the children or myself, the best part was walking through the underwater tank, seeing the fish and sharks swimming over your head. Took about 40 minutes in all. Next we went to the food street. It was ok but no western restaurants just McDonald's and KFC both of which we don't eat. The was a papa johns but it was closed down. There was a bar that claimed to serve steak but it was a Very very poor Imitation of it so we left it on our plates. The piano museum was nice to see how pianos changed over the years. The only bad thing I can say was he beaches. We found two out of the way beaches no one around but it was Dirty , broken bottles, rubbish , metal pieces . I even saw what look like a shipwreck on the beach. Not good for children to play.(that why 4 points not 5)  I didn't like the wait for the ferry going there, they packed us into a cage to wait for the ferry it was hot and crowded . Would I come back again yes I would most definitely."
Really a must see in Xiamen,"This island was really like visiting an old European city with its narrow pathways and little shops and restaurants. You can climb to the top of the mountain, I'd recommend not doing that in the afternoon heat. It's an easy and inexpensive ferry ride to the island. I would recommend spending the night on the island so you can enjoy a nice cool evening walk without the daytime crowds."
Go early and avoid the crowds,"This was worth the trip. After reading many reviews we were anticipating large crowds, so we left early. No queues, easy boarding onto the ferry and the Island was fairly quiet for the first hour. Fascinating place, lots of walking and great views from Sunlight Rock.Do your research before you go as you may find it difficult to ask someone for help in English."
A pearl of a pedestrian island,"This jewel of a place used to be the location of many countries' consulates when Xiamen was a busy international trading port. Now it's narrow streets and charming seaside attract tourists from all over the world. It's quiet--no cars, buses, taxis. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be ready to climb a bit. Sunlight rock has a beautiful panoramic view. There is a MacDonald's and KFC for those who want to see something familiar. Lots of souvenir shops. Go to Pearl World for amazing deals on genuine pearl jewelry."
2nd Time going to Gulangu Island now.,"Originally I went there like 5 years ago but reasons going back again because was travelling with my Brother in law who hasn't been there before, we went there just after Typoon Nesta went past because it was closed for the last few days and re-open, very big crowds, I used from Songyu Wharf to Neicuoao Wharf, its not very English Friendly but it has English writing there but my Wife speak Chinese so I'm not sure how its like to buy a ticket in English just be aware of this. The island has a lot of things to do, if you like walking and sight seeing, worth spending a day there."
"Beautiful place, very crowded","It is kind of a pain to visit here as a foreigner because a lot of hotels in the city only accept mainlanders and there are special consideration when buying your ticket, i.e. you leave from a different port. It is a great place though. In my opinion, it is a bit too big and crowded to enjoy on a day trip. I wish i had stayed the night and done some sightseeing once the last ferry left/ before the first ferry arrived. Also, the little boutique hotels on the island are beautiful. And go in the winter, because it is really hot and humid."
Foreign travelers ‚Äì Special instructions,"Passport, ports, crowd avoidance/mitigationBring your passport, this is required for purchasing your ferry ticket and boarding.  The fare is CNY35 for a roundtrip ticket (return).There are two passenger ferry ports on the Xiamen side (3.5km distance apart), one just north of Zhongshan Pedestrian Mall, referred to as the domestic port; and the other across from Hubin North Road, referred to as the international port.  Foreign travelers can only use the northern international port.  A recent exception is foreign travelers may use the southern domestic port after 6:30PM, understanding the last ferry returns to Xiamen around midnight.  Being the domestic port, there is absolutely no English signage and less chance of any English speaking employees or travelers.There are two passenger ferry ports on the Gulangyu Island (.8km distance apart).  Foreign passengers may alight at either port, but may board the ferry back to Xiamen only at the north port.  This is not a big deal as the ports are in 10 minute walk of one another, unlike the Xiamen side where the ports require a 10 minute taxi or 45 minute walk.It is extremely crowded during the weekends all day and night, and on weekdays all day.  The bearable times are in the early morning and weekday evenings.  The unbearable (and noisy) crowds tend to nullify any sort of tranquility of the colonial elegance of the island.  The bottlenecks are at ticketing, which could be mitigated with advanced online ticket purchasing, but it is only in Chinese and requires a WeChat payment account; and at boarding.  During peak times, you may have to wait for one or two ferries.  It is literally a cattle call once the cattle gates open.  It could be dangerous if you were to fall and get trampled. Thus, for most sane travelers who enjoy some sort of peace and tranquility, go in the very early morning or weekday evenings, then immediately head to the hills and opposite end of the island, further away from the ports the better.The better places to eat, as recommended by fellow travelers on this site, will likely have long queues, since it is a small island with relatively limited restaurant choices, most congregated near the ports.  A strategy is to enjoy a less crowded meal with more selection and more competitive price at Zhongshan Pedestrian Mall before/after your trip to the island.The ferry is the main way tourism officials limit access to the island, for purposes of minimizing impact to the life on the island and enhance the traveler experience.  The restrictions for foreign travelers are part of this understandable plan.Enjoy."
The colonial island ,"It is definitely interesting to visit. Different China. Lots of shopping and walking around. Most of stores give samples. One day trip was enough for us.  I'd recommend going in the winter and on a weekday. We did it in July in 34C and on Saturday, and it was pretty miserable heat and the amount of people was insane."
A great island off the coast of Xiamen,"We took tour to Gulangyu Island while in port in Xiamen. It takes about 15 min. by Ferry to get their.  The island used to be where the British, French and countries from Europe had their homes, embassy etc.  Now the island is a local place for families to visit and stay the weekend.  Their are dozens for rest., and stores. It you have time stop a a fish rest. for you can pick out the live fish or crab an have them cook it right their. We did not have enough time to really take in the island so I would recommend staying a couple of days to really enjoy it."
A Lovely Place to See,This is a lovely place to walk around and enjoy the streets. It can get very crowed. If it is a hot day please take a hat. Well worth the visit.
An Island with History,"As part of a shore excursion in Xiamen, China, we took a ferry to Gulangyu Island.  I gem of a place with both history and retail opportunities.  It is a place where we saw many bride's having pictures taken at the venues from the 19th century.  Once this island opened to the world, consulates from many nations set up here.  The last building in the old town area was built in 1921.  There is a puppet show with a pre-show of traditional Chinese instruments.  Easily 2 hours in the old town alone.  The rest of the island are shopping and hotels to easily be a nice day out in the Xiamen area."
Be Sure To Check the Ferry Schedule in Advance!,"Went there many years ago and decided to re-visit.  We only found out that the ferry terminal has moved to a new location when the taxi driver dropped us off.  Apparently, the old terminal is now only for the locals.  When we arrived at around 1:00 pm, we noticed the next ferry was at 2:30pm.  There was a huge queue - around 600-700 people waiting to board the ferry.  A notice there advises people to arrive 60 mins in advance to avoid ""delays"".  With a temperature of 34C, we could not be bothered to wait and decided to give up.   Feeling disappointed,  we decided to go to the old ferry pier and see what is available.  We found out they have a cruise going to view the Jin Men island (Taiwan) which costs RMB 136.  There was hardly any people there so we decided to take the 100 min cruise which was quite pleasant to see the scenery along the way.  So before you go to the Gulanyu island, be sure to check the ferry schedule ahead to avoid lengthy waiting."
overcrowded pushalong,"This beautiful island with its historical buildings would have ranked five stars some years back. It is now uverrun by thousands of cruise ship passengers whose malinformed guides urge them to move along quickly and close up the ranks. How I enjoyed it back in 1979 and how awful it has become. Visit it only when you see no cruse liners in port, otherwise visit the great shopping avenues like Zhongshan Rd in the heart of town or visit a nearby water village."
Very cute little island,Quite a few shops selling typical touristy things. Lovely to walk around the island. Look out for the brides (photo) and many dogs. Take comfortable shoes and an umbrella with raincoat!
Good exercise,"The little island is home to different architectural design due to its history (different nations lived there for a time). But the island is full of peddlers already (food stalls, teas, pearls...) and entrances to the gardens and other attractions are a bit expensive.  I think there's a 100yuan all in.I suggest getting that package and go early to the island. The walk around the island is nice. The view from the beach looking at Xiamen City is also nice. Yes, it's worth going once.."
Hate the ferry ride,"The island is beautiful and serene. Do not go during summer holidays the place is packed and omg the ferry ride was absolute chaos. People pushing and fighting over seats, absolute nightmare if you have small children."
A surprisingly 'European' island in the South China Sea,"A calm, easy-going community basking on the eclectic architecture of its affluent past and looking forward to an equally prosperous present and future. The early 20th century villas are impressive, the gardens luscious and the lawns manicured. The views are spectacular from the top of the hill - if you can make it up there... All in all, well worth a visit!"
Interesting district of Xiamen,"Interesting area to walk around that includes some fine, old mansions that are now open as museums, etc.  Can get quite crowded.  Commercial street is filled with tourist joints and not very interesting.  Worth a few hours if you are in Xiamen."
too many people,"This place like Tai Wan is a nice place for relax but too many peopleand the shop cheat the oversea customer,last time I travel to this land I feel this is a great place but now all around the shop, become a business center, in past this place like a little Taiwan, everyone very nice, but now only businessmay be everyplace if develop to be a travel place will have the same problem"
Quite a nice place to walk around and enjoy the architeture,"Quite a nice place to walk around and enjoy the architetureWe took a buggy (35 yuan) to move around the island faster, and hired a tour guide (60 yuan) to guide us.Weather in June was way too hot, and we could only last half a day.Looks like a place where plenty of wedding couples travel to for photo taking. Piano museum was quite interesting and we enjoyed looking at the different kinds of piano."
Had to Go,"Went on a semi-rainy day so I think we avoided some of the typical crowds, but the ferry station was still crowded and the least favorite part of the trip. Once on the island, we did the entire loop and tried to see most parts. Passed probably a dozen wedding photo shoots happening all in the same 10 meter patch of land which was interesting, there's a whole other island here guys. The hike up the mountain was probably my favorite part, stream of people when you get to the top but the paths in between were relatively quiet and it is a nice view from so high up."
Great ,"Beautiful island. Make sure you have 6 to 8 hours to spend there. A long walk is ahead of you. Locals sell water, fruits. There were few restaurants, hotels where you could also get an afternoon tea. We didn't want to eat there, but tea and cold drinks were good. We took a ferry from Xiamen, it took like 20 mins and the same ferry back but that time it was like 5 mins. Depends on the station. We bought round way ticket it was 35¬• per person and the departure time to the island is stated but the return time was totally up to us. We arrived around 12.00 and left around 7.00 pm. Had great time, was absolutely lovely."
Interesting island,"The buildings take on design features from various European countries. The scenery is fantastic almost everywhere in the island, either by the beaches or high up on the mountain looking to the ocean and the Xiamen shoreline. The piano museum is a must-see tourist spot. I have never seen so many different types of pianos in one place. The only negative aspect is that it is too crowded on weekends. Try going there on weekdays."
Visited Twice  In One Week,"We went with different Tour Guides to Gulangyu. There are ""millions"" of people crossing in the ferry and at the island. Many historical buildings on the island but mostly you can only see the outside. Restaurants and gift shops everywhere! It's a commercial tourist location!"
Must see for tourists ,Gulongyu Island is a great place to spend the day - a number of sightseeing areas around the island and things to do. Would recommend going early morning and staying until night (to see the sunset). Weather dependant. On the weekend or holidays many people go. But this is one of the must sees for tourists to Xiamen
Crowded Ferry Terminal,"Foreigners can only purchase ferry tickets via ticketing window, not self-ticketing machine. The whole place is full of stores selling snacks and souvenirs."
Must visit!,Easy to walk around whole island. Last ferry leaves at 5.30 and would avoid leaving trip till afternoon.
A very old Island resort,"Originally the Dutch arrived here in the 17th Century but didn't last long and it came to prominence during the Opium War when ""westerners"" established residences here - it's a quaint old town with many streets of great interest due to the colonial buildings established. Has no motor vehicles to speak of and its well worth a visit"
Individual island with minimal vehicle,"Fresh air at this island.Need to take buggy to move around the island quickly. Looks like a place where plenty of young couple travel to for wedding photo taking. The few resort or chalet along the road did not look luxurious, pretty normal looking. If you are walking along the shores of the island, please look out for the buggy as they might get real close to you and honk. Not exactly very safe. Do note that the gift shops in the island tend to be quite ex. Eg the dried squid u bought was half price on mainland."
"One of the main tourist attractions in Xiamen, but crowded on weekends","Interesting island with architecture influence from the West. Narrow winding streets with gated hotels that were converted from old conserved houses.Visit the garden, and stay till evening to enjoy the activities and life along the streets of the main town.Avoid weekends as it will be flooded with local tourists"
An interesting island with history,The island has its history and full of old buildings. Unfortunately too many street foods and noisy streets filled with mostly local tourists. Heard that you have to buy scalper's ferry tickets to the island during the peak season. It's a waste of time and money visiting the Water World on the island - great disappointment.
Overrated and overly crowed,"A huge disappointment from what I remembered 20 years ago. The place now is full of tourist and if you are not a local resident, you will be treated differently for the transportation. You have to either transit at another island (which is a total waste of time) or go some other far away ferry terminal for a direct ride. Expect the worst at the ferry terminals, especial during peak time.Anyway on the island itself, there isn't much to see as well. There are many repeated shops with way too much focus on packing. Every little tourist spot will have to pay extra entry fee.Overall, very disappointed."
Nice walking place.,"Lots of food, views are great, suggest the carts to lessen walking, guides available, 30 RMB, carts 30 RMB."
Understanding History,"A must go place if you are interested in the history & local culture. However, be wary of the local personal tour guides. Ask for the actual price before you make any purchase or accept any service."
"Not so bad, but not that great.","Went there for a few hours, the historical building and area were quite good, the view was okay. Had a lot of street food options and shopping streets as well. But for overall experience, it was only so so. Good if you like to stroll around and shop and see historical building. But if you go there for the view, I've seen better views."
Historical island in Xiamen,"An island worth a visit if you are in Xiamen. Rather croudy as it's very popular also for the Chinese people to visit, but still worth it. Nice views and possibilities to experience historical buildings (traditional tea serving buildings) and a Piano museum. Nice restaurants along the main street, but if you are brave try some of the small ones along the side roads."
Great island getaway for a day,"Caught the ferry (seems to be always crowded) to the island where numerous guides will accost you offering their services for between 30-60 yuan. We decided to explore the island ourselves, with the aid of an island map bought from one of the many vendors at the pier area. The Tourist Information Centre was next to useless - no maps, no other information and at the time we dropped by, only manned by 2 staff and not a single tourist inside.  Many different architecture can be seen on the island, on account of the various nationalities that had occupied the island in the past. Good photo opportunities abound, if you can somehow get a shot without all the other tourists constantly milling about. There are numerous attractions on the island to visit, most needing an entrance fee, though you could buy a  5 in 1 day pass for the attractions for 100 yuan.There are many restaurants and stalls selling food, though be prepared to pay premium prices here for exactly the same thing you could get off island. Shops hawking souvenirs and traditional foods abound. The pedestrian only streets can be somewhat narrow and hilly in some parts so a comfortable pair of walking shoes is recommended if you intend to be exploring the island extensively.Overall, not a bad destination for a day trip."
Quaint Island But Getting A Bit Too Commercial,"My mom used to live in Gulangyu but she had migrated out of China in the early years.  It's nice to go back and visit the place and it's nice that they have maintained it as an all pedestrian island.  Even if the old houses have mostly been renovated, the ambiance is still maintained and it's nice to feel and see the culture and history after all these years.I viisted this island more than 2 decades ago and another time 14 years ago and I still love the vibe this island gives.  Many locals still live in the island which makes it a real treasure.There is a commercial area now where you can go to eat and shop for local souvenirs and food stuff.  But it has become too crowded.  We went on a weekday but there was still a lot of people.  There is now a wax museum, an aquarium, Mc Donalds, KFC, etc.  Good part is that there is income comng in from tourists, foreigners an local Chinese from other parts of China.  Foreigners now have to take another ferry that's 4-5 times more expensive and most take the electric battery operated trams to get around.  There is a good balance nowadays of the commercial and tourism area versus the back roads where the locals still live in.  I just wish that it would not become too commercial to the point that it loses its charm.Definitely a place to visit when in Xiamen."
Nice getaway from traffic  and cars but not from people,"Gulanguy is always super crowded, no matter if it's raining or a cold weather. Tickets Chinese can buy online, but foreigners has to purchase is only at the ticket office. Line usually is not big (3-4 people). Before 5 pm ferry departures from the Cruise terminal that is near Dongdu station. After 5pm from Lundu. To get to both terminals you can by bus.Come couple hours earlier to buy tickets, because usually they are sold out for the ferries that are in a next hour.Bring PASSPORT and KEEP TICKET because it's a round trip ticket.Gulanguy is nice even for just walking around. But if you feel strength, you can buy 100 yuan all museums entrance ticket, which definitely will save you time and money."
"Interesting island, occupied by 13 different foreign nations in history ","Spent 5 hours on the island, assisted by a Chinese speaking guide that we met just after we arrived on the ferry. The guide is an official tourist guide as we paid the travel bureau and had to give an official review on a form at the end. Interesting to learn that the British were the first to occupy this island and that the Japanese were the last, so there are many buildings with a foreign influence.Lots of shopping, including cheap pearls. Plan to spend at least 4 to 5 hours to get a good flavor of the place. If you speak Chinese, get the guide for RMB 60 for the whole trip."
Good for the 10000 steps a day,"It's a very toeristic place, but you can have a nice walk. We enjoyed the sight of many bridal couples, to change clothes and walk to different places. Very funny. A lot of buildings are under restauration and some streets were to crowded to have a proper view. But it's nice to walk along the cost."
First Time Visit,"Nice to visit and to walk around the island.  Lots of photo opportunities and places to see as you stroll across different parts of the island.  At 5 pm as you try to catch the ferry back to Xiamen, be prepared to line up to catch the ferry.  Line moves quickly and ferries come every 10 minutes."
"People Sea, People Mountain",Too busy. Maybe midweek in winter might be a better time.Interesting colonial history. Lovely buildings. My highlight was the rugby team that I coach won the Xiamen Cup (all China ladies ten-a-side competition) on the Foreigners Football Field. The most superb rugby pitch I ever visited.Seafood stalls and restaurants abound.
Recreational ,"Its an excellent Place in Xiamen to visit, an island in an island :) very beautiful place, old houses, old streets but loads of tourists. Island is very beautiful."
Car free Island,"We took a ferry to this island and it was crowded with tourists even though it was not a weekend. Cars are not allowed on the island. Only electric buggies are used to transport tourists around the island.We spend sometime walking along the narrow streets lined with food stalls selling a variety of local snacks and fruits. There are also shops selling chinese tea, pearls, clothes and seafood. Along the streets, we passed some private villas and some were previously used as consulates but are now abandoned. Some consulates were turned into apartments and hotels.The island is a favourite place to take wedding photos. When we were there, we saw many young couples taking photographs in their wedding attire.Recommended to visit the island as China's only Piano Museum in Shuzhuang Garden is located here."
crowded but good scenery,enjoyed walking freely and safely on the streets of Island even though it is crowded. a lot of old buildings to view
Not worth it.,Very very crowded and extremely commercialized.  Not worth going.  Full of mainlanders.  On the day I went there it was very windy and full of mainland visitors.
A must,It's an awesome experience to go with friends.The view and touristic places are incredible.The food is expensice though.
Crowded and overrated,The ferry going over during the week visit was mobbed and hard to find a seat on 25 minute ride. Plus it was a rainy day. The island had some interesting buildings but all is very touristy with lots of shops and restaurants.  Majority of people were Chinese tourists. There is opportunity to spend the night on island and saw a small beach. I personally did not think it was worth the time and effort to go there.
If they could only limit the number of visitors,"The place used to be a nice tourist spot to visit. But the sheer number of visitors the island takes in on a daily basis doesn't make it that appealing anymore. Especially if you are travelling with elderly people who run the risk of being pushed around by the crowd. Otherwise, the island is very peaceful, serene with lots of scenic spots to visit. It is starting to get too commercialized, especially the area facing the ferry terminal. You are amazed when you see some of the old houses and gardens. I really hope they maintain the beauty of the island"
Worth a visit,"Britain made Gulangyu Island its fortress. After its turn over to the Chinese Government it has become a tourist attraction in Xiamen. The Island opens at 8 am and closes at 6 pm to tourists and local visitors. Everyone who goes in - needs to show identification like ID or passport. Visiting this Island is quite a challenge - Enduring long queue to the ferry terminal and the long queue to boarding in and out of the Island. Despite the hassle, many still come here because your Xiamen trip won't be complete without seeing Gulangyu. Avoid visiting on Holidays though. The ferry ride to the Island is an experience in itself. It lasts for about 20 minutes. Take the seats outside the boat to enjoy the view. At the ticket booth in the island, secure your tickets before entering. We bought a ticket to the Sunlight Rock at 60 rmb. We like climbing and taking short hikes. We were walking for a while but then we noticed the E cab. With a small fee, we got around the Island fast and easy. Other than the e cabs there are no vehicles in the vicinity. While touring the gardens I noticed that Construction materials were transported through carts pulled by strong  old men.  Unfortunately, the piano museum was closed during our visit. Six hours is not enough to explore the Island. As much as we want to stay longer, time limits us.  All the restaurants were full, so we ended up eating at a fast food. Given a chance, we will probably visit the place again. It is worth spending weekend here."
Romantic city,"Great city for couples, stayed in a hotel on top of a mountain. There was a piano outside of our room, 5 star services!Lots of little shops, slow post office (the mails take more than 1 year to arrive haha), seafood, beach, swimming and more memorable if you choose over night stay!"
Nice island ,It's worth to see this island as this is a more quite spot without lots of traffic. Take care that you take the ferry to the right port.
A breath of fresh from Xiamen,"Air is fresher than in Xiamen.Needs at least 1-2 overnight stay to fully appreciate the islet.  There are lots of places to see as well as just taking the time to explore the island.  Takes a good 4-5 hours to walk around the islet.Not recommended for folks who are not able to walk, because even with the electric carts, the route offered is incomplete, meaning that the cart takes you only to a certain part of the island, then you have to walk 20-25 minutes (some inclines, not too interesting) towards the Shushuang Garden/Piano Museum.  From there, you can pick up the cart again to the ferry terminal.  If you don't speak Mandarin, bring the map so you can ask if you are stopping at the correct ferry terminal to go back to Xiamen.  The walk from the S.Garden/Piano museum to the Sanqiutian dock (back to Xiamen) is only 25 minutes.  It is a very interesting one as you pass thru several shops and restaurants, Christ the King Cathedral, winding narrow streets, etc.Western style toilets are a rarity.  Can be a challenge to find one.  There is a very elegant hotel - Marine Garden Hotel- where there are modern facilities and where you can stop for dining.Worth the extended stay there if you can afford the time to see the landmarks.Crowd is part of the scenery unfortunately.  Streets are busy even on a Monday. Lining up for the ferry back to Xiamen is an experience by itself - packed like sardines, a wall of people pushing forward, no orderly ropes to guide the crowd to board the ferry.  This is a relatively inexpensive improvement that would make for a safer boarding.  Some folks even climbed over the ferry railing to jump the queue!  One wonders why the authorities have not thought of this at all."
Beautiful but so busy,"It was a beautiful place to just stroll around,but there are also many attractions, as well! It's a very busy island, super crowded, so be aware of that. Overall, really nice."
Good place to visit,The best time to visit is at dusk. But it's inconvenient to live on the island and it's too expensive. A lot of street food you can try.
A place to visit if you have a spare day,"I visited Gulangyu a few times whilst living in Xiamen with friends and family.Gulangyu is the sort of place to check out if you're living in Xiamen, or there for a few days and have a day (atleast half a day) spare.Spare shops/markets, a lookout, a beach for those wanting to swim (they bring the sand in)."
Beautiful Island with Plenty of photo taking scenes,You need to purchase a ferry ticket to go to the island. The tour guide told us that it has to be bought earlier as the tickets are usually sold out. There are a lot of old structures that has been restored and enhanced for photo taking session. one of the highlight was the sunrise peak that takes about 1.5 hour walk to and from. I also took the opportunity to visit the 1st Organ Piano that was placed in the Organ Museum. The view on the island is quite nice..
"ÂúíÊ¥≤Ëå∂ËãëÂéªÂñùËå∂Âêß! Have a quality Chinese tea time bah,","Special recommendation : Randomly visit a tea house on this island - ÂúíÊ¥≤Ëå∂Èô¢, the servant is patient to prepare different tea for trial, you can chat with her to know more about Chinese tea culture. Suggestion: Island is always packed with tourists, if you have time, suggest to stay 1 night to visit island by your own tempo - slow & alley visit. Typical south Chinese building is one of my favorite visit here.Spring time is a good season (Feb or March) to visit island.

quiet nice expeirence,It was a amazing experience which I thoroughly enjoyed and I wish I could have stayed there a little bit longer.
Dont visit during holidays,"Tried to visit Gulangyu during CNY, too much rush. All tickets were sold out for consecutive three days. Plans wasted. Will try to visit some other time."
Busy!,"There wasn't too much to do on the island apart from feast on a number of different street food. The atmosphere was what I expected it to be - busy and bustling.A pleasant 10 minute ride on the ferry will provide you with ample photo-taking opportunities, but the queues for the return ferry, particularly during peak hour will get painfully long so bear that in mind when deciding when to leave."
visited Piano Island for the Piano Museum,"Very hot weather, but worth exploring the pedestrian island that has banned all motor vehicles.  Very quaint, very atmospheric."
Scary ferry; serene island tour,"The ferry out is somewhat harrowing, especially for those not accustomed to Chinese crowds and lines. Poet Shu Ting, who is from this little island, complains that its character has been lost with the opening of the tourist industry. That said, the island feels large enough to hold us all, and provides a nice afternoon of wandering across beaches, gardens, parks, and little alleys filled with quaint cafes. Recommended, but book the ferry well ahead."
One place that you must visit,"Had a nice experiance here. A lot of shops and souvenirs. Be advise to come here early because it was full of people if on weekend or public holiday @ school holiday. A lot of colonial building.. toilet was nice but if you're muslim, be prepare with mineral water. There are not water pipe inside the toilet.. Got piano museum (cannot take photo) and garden. Nice place to be visit.."
Nice place for one day trip,Try to catch the early ferry to the island as it will not congested. Nice place to walk around the island. There is a street full with variety of food.
Charming little island ,"A must visit if you are in Xiamen! A charming small island off Xiamen city that is filled with beautiful old turn of the century colonial buildings and other rustic charm. Lots if lush greenery and old trees that aged beautifully over time. The island is virtually a picture a minute for the enthusiastic photographer. Many direction signs and summary write ups are available if you want to understand more about the many different old buildings. The English  explanation and signs are all very well done. There is also lots of shops, cafes and food to enjoy.  there are a lot of tour groups in the morning,  so I booked my ticket prior to the trip online. To avoid the crowds,  I choose to dock at the Neicuo'ao terminal on the north eastern side of the island.  When u arrive early , u will still hear the birds sing and the locals doing their morning rounds. This is the quieter side of the island. And as you proceed further south you will see more shops and food. They are to some commercialised but still for visitors I think some food stuff are quite unique to Xiamen. Must also visit the peak - sun light garden. U will get a beautiful view of the whole island. Lots to explore and at easy pace...one day is recommended.  no cars are allowed on the island so u walk and wander into many charming lanes and buildings discovery something at each corner.  you can leave the island at any ferry terminal but do take note of the last ferry and also keep yr ticket just in case."
A must excursion ,"Lovely Gulangyu is a 20 minutes ferry ride from the terminal. Foreigners must present passports for the RMB35 roundtrip fare. No vehicles except eco buggies, the island is a stroller's dream. Less than 2 square km, the main attraction is the Piano Museum. Seafood products and lots of local souvenirs line the main street of Long Tou Jie. Don't miss Gulangyu."
Small Island with a punch,"First of all, its Important to get to the correct jetty (Huangu Ferry Marina) to board & purchase you ticket, i was advise by the  hotel to go there early as the crowed is not that high. we manage to purchase & get on board with no issue, however when we arrive at the island, basically there will be alot of Freelance tour guide asking for hire. my personal tips: 1) you do not need a tour guide for this island. the island is not that huge & you can walk around with no issue (as long as you speak a little mandarin)2) wear comfortable WALKING Shoe. Yes, you will do quite a lot of walking in this island. the island do not have taxi nor other vihicle. the only transportation available is only electrical buggy.3) there are alot of food outlet & stall around the island, so eat until you cant stuff yourself anymore.4) Visit the highest point in Gu Lang Yu, Ri Guang Mountain. the view is breattaking.5) planned your return time carefully, the ferry will be quite full & you may need to wait for a few round to get on board."
Good intentions gone wrong,"I first visited Gulangyu not that many years ago, and this January, when I made a return visit, I was distressed at what it had become. Not that many years back, it was a quaint little island with a small commercial area where you find little cafes, restaurants, 'antiques' shops and art galleries. The businesses were small in scale and fitted in well with the ambiance of the islet. I was there during a weekday and the place was not busy.  One could walk among the villas and mansions, some in a rather dilapidated state, and be transported into a world that no longer existed outside of this islet. One could imagine what life was like last century for the people who lived there. You hear the tinkling of pianos being played by local residents. You could hear bird song. Not having vehicles on the island added to its charm as it was like stepping back in time, back to the 19th century. You can imagine a slower, simpler, more peaceful life.This time around, the noisy, large crowds at the new ""International"" Ferry Terminal at Xiamen gave an indication of what it would be like on Gulangyu. The ferry tickets were expensive, presumably to try and limit the number of day trippers but this measure was obviously unsuccessful and every day sees huge crowds travelling across to a small islet. Every ferry that departs every 1/2 hour or so would deposit another large crowd of day trippers on what is a rather small islet.Remember to bring your passport as for some reason, you will be asked to show it before you can buy your ferry ticket from Xiamen to Gulangyu. My Chinese was not fluent enough to seek an explanation why one had to produce a passport to travel the 20 minutes ferry ride. It takes 20 minutes because the ferry isn't doing the most direct route from Xiamen to Gulangyu.The islet was unrecognisable from my previous visit. The minute you step off the ferry, you will be assailed by touts wanting to guide you around the islet. The previously small and rather interesting commercial area has now been replaced by a larger, characterless, noisy place full of nondescript cafes, restaurants and shops selling all kinds of wares. There are touts yelling out their wares and touts trying to obtain patronage for their various businesses. Rather than stepping onto an islet where time stood still, it had become another busy Chinese market.Walking away from the commercial area does not bring much respite from the large crowds of day trippers. It appears the quaint buildings on the islet is a favourite for people wishing to take wedding photographs too. Gone is the bird song. Gone is the piano tunes from local residences. They cannot be heard above the din of conversations from day trippers and the zooming hither and tither every few minutes of municipal vehicles collecting rubbish.  Yes, many of the previously dilapidated buildings have been renovated and done up.  However, every second building is now a bar or a restaurant that appear over priced and sparely patronised. Unfortunately, it appears to be in that in effort to conserve the islet, the powers that be have caused it to lose its original charm and the main reason to visit. It has become a tragic victim of its own success.   Rather than a quaint islet filled with 19th century European and fusion architecture, where there are no vehicles, where time stood still, and one can hear the romantic strains of the piano and birdsong, it has now become another busy, noisy Chinese marketplace, like that of any Chinese city, except with historical European inspired buildings. The magic and charm of Gulangyu has mainly been lost although many of the impressive buildings have been renovated. I suspect that if you are an overseas visitor, or a Chinese visitor used to 'colonial' or European inspired architecture, you would wonder why such large crowds of day trippers flock here. The large numbers of Chinese from places where such architectural styles do not exist still find it interesting but it is no longer possible to step off the ferry and be transported into another time, another place."
Spend your time and money wisely on the island,"For international (non-china) travellers, please purchase the tickets beforehand prior to heading down. It's worthwhile to purchase the Deluxe Boat Ticket as the queue for the normal boat ride was madness. You will be swamped by tour guides once you get off the boat. The island is not that big with many directional signs. You really dont need any help from the tour guides. If you have limited time on the island,  Sunlight Scenic Area is a must-visit. Climb up to the platform to enjoy a good view of the rest of Gulangyu island."
A day trip to Gulangyu Island,Could spend a day in visiting the island which is full of western style buildings.  Don't miss Riguang Mountain (the highest point of the island) and the Zheng Chenggong statue.
Good place but,"Too many people , over crowed , should try to select number of people to access to island, hard to enjoy the moment when thousands people around in small tiny toads"
A stressful trip,"It was difficult to find out exactly where and how to catch a ferry to Gulangyu. We ended up taking a ferry for 2 yuan to Haicang first. From there there seem to be always ferry tikets available without pre booking, for 30 yuan. Passports are essential for buying ferry tickets.If you hire a tour guide please be mindful that they will take you to places that they can make more money out of you so best to avoid them. Signage in English on the island is very good so you don't need a guide. Overall the island is small and pleasant, though always overly crowded.  The stress of getting on and off the island makes the visit unattractive."
"Nice scenery, Luxury mansion",Many tourists visit this island on weekend because of the beautiful view and luxury mansion/building.
Unbelievably Crowded - Not That Good,"This is regarded as one of Xiamen's ""must do"" tourist experiences.  I went on a very hot day and it must have been one of the busiest days ever for this attraction!  The ferry over from Xiamen (Note: you must pre-book your ticket) was packed and the ferry back even more packed with huge queues and pushing and shoving to get on.  The Gulangyu island itself looked nice but I couldn't really see anything very special.  The massive swarming crowds everywhere made it difficult to get around easily.  Not pleasant and not fun.  Anyway I can say I have done it.  Would I want to see it again ... No."
Historic Scenes ,I good place to visit and even stay if you enjoy touristy and historical things. The ferries to and from the mainland are full of tourists and they crowd many spots for photo-taking. Best time to go there is on a weekday when there are less tourists. The island is well-maintained even though the locals do not advise to eat hawker street food or buy tea as they are a recipe for scamming unsuspecting visitors. One tip is to go a day earlier then start a tour of the island the following morning with the Sunshine Rock Peak then go down to the waterfront.
Area of heritage buildings developed during the colonial days,Take a short ferry ride to the island. You will see many things which you have NEVER seen before. Island well maintained and clean.
Historic island off Xiamen with only pedestrians and lots of small restaurants,"Gulangyu Island is a nice retreat from bustling Xiamen. Once you managed the crowd waiting for the ferry you arrive in a pedestrians paradise. Many footpaths crisscross this island which was originally inhabited by European foreigners. Many of the buildings are from colonial times and remind of the wealthy people who once lived there. Now most of these houses are being preserved and turned into boutique hotels and hostels at much lower prices than in town. Many restaurants opened along the narrow footpaths. There are even two tunnels crossing the local rocky hills.The center part of the island ist very touristic and massive crows flow through the small streets. The shops sell the usual souvenir stuff. But take a stroll little further and you find much less crowded areas with lovely restaurants. It is worth to walk a bit and spend at least a day.The only annoying this is how to get there. Locals can hop on a ferry right opposite of the island for about 8RMB. But foreigners have to take the 51 bus and ride to the International Ferry Terminal some 10 km away and line up. Depending on the time of the day, they pay 35 or even 50RMB to cross. Calculate a waiting time of an hour or even more in peak season. On a Monday morning we waited 45 min. Not very tourist friendly and not understandable."
Scenic and lots of lovely food!,"Something for everyone on this resort isle if you can tolerate the crowded ferries with the frenzied crowd rushing to board and get off, some with luggage that threatens to mow you down. Can be cold when the winter wind blows so make sure you have a warm jacket and scarf.Old-style architecture from colonial buildings and villas to modest cottages,  winding roads, plants, cats and dogs, Vistas to view the beaches, wedding shoots, seafood restaurants, street food, cafes make this a fun and lively place. You don't even need to pay for the combined ticket to visit places like the Sunlit Rock or Fishbone Museum though these are interesting for the connoisseur.  Just walk around using the very clear road signage,  plenty of toilet facilities too.Seafood options are fresh and delicious, you can try the famous peanut soup at one of the small shops or just eat the barbecued softshell crabs or oyster omelets at any of the stalls."
this is not a small island...,"plan to spend the day otherwise you will not be able to see much of the island. there are some golf carts that can transport you around the island, i'd recommend it, as it will take you from point a to point b faster. english is very limited there. hard to communicate with the locals but they are very friendly and they try to understand us to the best of their abilities. local food is delicious with all seafood prepared on the spot as you choose what you want to eat from saltwater aquariums. the piano museum is worthwhile your visit a the palace where it sits on top on the hill. i would not recommend getting into the ocean there as there were signs stating it was forbidden to do so. we visited a bar/restaurant that faced the ocean and had live music. the service was so so, due to the difficulty in communicate, but the food was great. several vendors selling local fruits, coconuts, etc. you can bargain a lot. sometimes it will work and sometimes it will not. there is a center that is located to the left of the main arrival pier and it has a lot of history to it. several important houses and facilities. too much to describe here. all in all, an excellent day trip."
