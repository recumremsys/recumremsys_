Stunning Coast line.,"What a beautiful line of Coast.   Pristine sand and such a big long wide beach that even though people were there, you still felt like you were secluded.   Many people were just up on blankets enjoying the views and the day.  The water is super warm and inviting, however Crocs are known to frequent the area, so beware.  Lots of places for photography and lots of places for the kids to play among trees and the sands alike.  And like all northern beaches Stinger season is well looked after as they do net a small area to swim in.   There are accommodation close and there is a little restaurant and fish and chip shop  just up from the carpark, so you could easy spend the day here."
Beautiful Tropical Beach ,"We are from Brisbane area close to Mt Tamborine and we still felt this beach compared to the rain forest and coast line is no where near as tropical as Four mile beach. We loved it and walked along it, however we felt a little sad we could not swim in it as there is Crocs about and stingers this time of year. We still loved the views and how hard the sand was to walk on, plus, if you pay attention, the sands have this silver kinda glitter sparkle to it. It’s real weird yet kinda awesome!!"
Walk the 4 mile beach,Very pleasant walk enjoyed every inch of it with the coconut trees coming right up to the beach. Beautiful clean beach
Beautiful pristine beach,"Wonderful pristine beach, great for a walk at any time of the day.  Great early in the morning when it is virtually empty and great in the late afternoon as the sun is setting.  Very busy during the middle of the day.Great to leave the car at one end of the beach and do the whole 4 mile beach walk and back again.At the Port Douglas end, the beach is patrolled with full life-saver facilities with umbrellas, beach chairs etc to hire.  Free change rooms and showers available."
Morning Walks,Beautiful beach for morning walks. Quite popular. Significant change in tide so had a different feel in the afternoon.
What’s the hype about four mile beach?,Went for a walk one morning - beach is average. It’s flat so that’s great if you want to walk or run
Iconic Aussie Beach,"A lovely pice of sand on the eastern side of Port Douglas stretching south. Out of sight is the Great Barker Reef. Lifeguards made it secure for us, but they did warn about stingers at the water’s edge."
"One of the best beaches I've ever seen, and I'm from NQ.","One of the best beaches I've ever seen, and competes well with the Rainforest and Reef as the ultimate draw cards of the region."
Beautiful,Loved the beach ..great for a long walk and for swimming in the safety of flags good area behind the beach to sit and have a picnic and surf club meals are great
Walking Four Mile Beach is a fantastic way to start and end every day,A beautiful beach - what more can you say? Just a beautiful stretch of sand with palm trees and one side and the Coral Sea on the other. Beware the crocs and the stingers. Walking it is a fantastic way to start and end every day you stay in Port Douglas
Great beach for relaxed walk or a swim.,"Long open sandy beach and not too crowded.  Beautiful breeze. Couples, families and a few well behaved dogs and owners enjoying themselves at a respectful distance."
Wow,"Just beautiful, peaceful and quiet well worth a visit to clear the head and relax and take in the sea air"
Just beautiful ,"Seen this on a good and bad day, both times it’s stunning. So peaceful and clean. It’s got surf life savers patrolling the beachThere is a cliff walk to offer a higher view. Highly recommend"
Beautiful beach,What a lovely beach to have your daily walks! The water is warm and the beach is fringed with lovely coconut palms.
Stunning walk along the beach,"Great beach walk.   Relaxing, great views.  Close to town and easy walk.  Access for wheelchairs too.  Beautiful, a must when visiting Port Douglas"
Beautiful spot,Idyllic beach with all the palm trees and calm waters.Great beach to ride a bike along and worth getting up early for the sunrise
Rainforest flanking the curving sands,"There are so many beautiful beaches in Queensland. For sure this is one of them, mainly due to the rainforest flanking the curving sands, but is it actually one of the best? We put it to the test with both a visit to Trinity Bay Lookout and then an afternoon stroll along its actual 3.2 mile length. Didn't quite live up to the hype for us."
Wonderful place ,"This beach is a must if you are visiting Port Douglas. Pristine beach, tranquil waters, life savers, nets to prevent stingers, shade, where you can witness how the Daintree meets the Great Barrier Reef. What else could you ask for?"
The beach on beautifully with hills in background,The beach doesn't have much surf but is fabulous to walk beside or lounge and enjoy the rolling waves.
Wow,"Standing on a beach, its hard to take in the full beauty, but once I visited the Trinity Bay Lookout, Four Mile Beach truly stood out as one of the nicest in the area"
Lovely,"Beautiful beach - a bit cold to swim in July but lovely for a walk. A few good cafes on the waterfront, and a nice walk up to the look outs from the northern end of the beach (don't have to take the full Flagstaff hill trek). Beach hut had beach umbrellas and deck chairs for hire at reasonable prices."
Beautiful location,Stunning beach with plenty of covered areas.A couple of local cafes nearby or short walk to main shopping area.Well patrolled and safe for families
Beautiful uncrowded beach.,"Nice firm sand, warm water (in winter). Friendly people. Dog friendly. A great walk. Avoid the southern end of the beach where crocs are said to lurk."
Beautiful! ,"This is one hell of a beach. Beautiful fine sand and warm water! Lifeguards on duty and lots of people running, biking and playing. Great spot for the family."
One of our finest beaches,"We were lucky enough to stay five nights on Four Mile Beach. This beach is perfect for a jog or stroll, and has to be one of the most beautiful beaches in the country. If you go for sunrise, you will see the most spectacular colours"
Beautiful Beach,Four Mile Beach is a beautiful unspoiled  beach where you will always enjoy yourself. A great place to meet your friends for a picnic.
Short break ,"One of the great beaches in Australia, watching the sunrise here has to be one of life’s memorable moments."
Visited beautiful Four Mile Beach in February 2020,My wife and I visited Four Mile Beach during February 2020.  We agreed it is a beautiful beach and observed many families including toddlers playing together on the beach and in the surf.  We enjoyed our time walking in the pleasant surf and wonderful weather.  I hope to be able to visit and enjoy Four Mile Beach again.
Great beach for a long afternoon walk,"We walked along the beach and there was so much happening - kit surfing, wind surfing, sunbathing on the shore, segways tours, people walking their dogs and patterns on the sand from the crabs."
Stunning ,I can’t say anymore about this beach - very special - walk it bike it Segway it jog it just do it if you can
Great position ,Cold beer and big screen tv for watching the footy. Great people watching as you can sit right on the street. Had the salt and pepper squid and it was tasty. Will go back.
Awesome beach experience,"Excellent activity Segway-ing (assume its a verb!) along the 4 Mile Beach with great guide, Ant.  We had lots of fun - smiles all the way."
Amazing beach,Very nice beach. Seemingly not recommended to swim there as crocs are lurking. But extremely nice walk and fun. Together with stunning view
Port Douglas beach ,This is the only beach in town but runs right down one side and is quite pretty. Patrolled section is close to town. Gets quite busy but definitely worth doing while you are here.
Beautiful walking beach,We enjoyed walking along Four Mile Beach each day. It’s a wonderful walk with beautiful views. Many people also hire bikes and it’s a great beach to ride on.
Amazing patrolled beach,Great weather with kid friendly waves. Stunning panoramic views of ocean and mountains. Tidy street with beach showers. Limited parking.
"Aussie, Aussie , Aussie!!! ","Such a nice beach to walk, ride or just hang out ! Very clean and patrol for a swim !Nice caffe at the end of it with a seaside walk going back to the Main Street"
Great place for a long Beach walk,"Great place to walk, take the pups and meet locals, very friendly beach. Afternoon walks are the best, quite comfortable weather."
Great spot to throw a line,"Our little family getaway had us staying at a resort which had beach access to the beautiful four mile beach. Many friendly locals walk their dogs along the area throughout the day where we visited. Whilst there we threw some lines in and caught several bream, stripped grunters and even blue threadfin salmon. It’s a beautiful place to visit!"
beautiful,This is a beautiful beach but was closed because of a very tiny jellyfish.  But a lovely walking beach.
cordoned off part to swim,"There was a small part cordoned off to swim. However, the beach charis to rent closed at 5 p.m. and the guy charged us 50% for 1 hour !!!!!"
Picturesque and peaceful,"A wonderful place for a walk and to meet locals. I frequented the beach morning and evening for a stroll on my recent trip to Port Douglas. The locals were super friendly and it was such a pleasant walk. The beach is very clean and well maintained. I cannot speak about swimming as it was stinger season :( and did not get an opportunity.A little tip for anyone who loves nature and/or birds... of an evening, head towards the end of four mile beach away from the port end toward the mangroves at sunset and you will find flocks of rainbow bee-eaters gathering there - quite a sight!"
Awesome walk,"We were warned not to go in the waTer because of the time of year, jelly fish. But we had a very nice walk along the beach. Would highly encourage it even if you cant go in to the water, enjoy the walk."
"Walk, walk, walk","What a beautiful beach this would be when it is clean.  Because we have arrived after some stormy weather, cyclone, there is a lot of debris on the beach.  Sea weed and drift wood.  There is a swimming section (flags) which is patrolled by life savers.  We have walked on the beach everyday, so have quite a few other people.  Joggers and bike riders also share this amazing stretch of beautiful coastline."
"Deserted, awesome & clean beach..","We stayed at The Peninsula Boutique Hotel, at the far end of this awesomely serene Beach (just off Main Street, at the town end).The hotel, sits back but next to the beach and is ideally scenically located for the beach.Four Mile Beach is a Stunning view to see & a pleasure to explore.. Its wide; clean and the sand is not grainy underfoot..Yes, there can sometimes be jellyfish in the water - BUT, you can swim in the safe / secure netted area (at the one end of the beach), snorkel & see the sea life very safely.. There’s also a lifeguard here, should you get into distress - again, adding to the safety of this lovely beach..Additionally, you can cycle down this beach easily and safely - as well as enjoying a gentle stroll👍Just, don’t forget the sunscreen - whatever your doing on the beach😎"
"Stunning Beach,shame about the Stingers.","We wandered along here several times during our stay at The Sheraton Mirage and it really is a stunningly beautiful beach and is quite breathtaking visually,but during our stay it was unfortunately Stinger season so were unable to enter the water at anytime."
Great beach and very romantic for a walk,"Love this beach.  It is an easy walking sand beach that has beautiful views.  It stretches the entire resort length and I recommend walking to town along it at least once.There is a patrolled swimming area close to town, but the rest I would not recommend.  Stingers are found here in warmer months.The furthest end of the beach has mangroves that are home to crocodiles - so defiantly not recommended to go in the water at that end."
Unspoilt beautiful beach ,Shame about the stingers so you can only swim in the netted area of the public beach but we did the walk from one end to the other and it’s stunning
"February 2020, low surf, lots of jellyfish, and locals said to watch for crocs.","It was a hot, humid February 2020.  The low surf brought in only a rare half clam shell at best.  Locals advised not to go swimming becasue of the jellyfish, especially around sunset.  They advised not to go into the ""safe zone"" ringed by floatable noodles as well.  Locals and seasonal visitors also advised about crocs -- which I did not see."
Awesome,What a fun experience. Hubby & I decided to give Segway a go especially since we were going to experience this on the beach. Ant our guide & owner gave us a few lessons patiently (note: we are baby boomers) . We had such fun. Saw a manta ray in the ocean and an Osprey along our trip. Felt very safe. This is a must do experience in PD.
"Beautiful beach, but not swimmable in summer","The beach is beautiful, however I was struck by the complete lack of people present.  Summer is marine stinger season (jellyfish) and no swimming is allowed except for an area which is screened off for bathers.  You can however walk the beach which was scattered with coconuts and have it all to yourself.  It felt like being on Survivor!"
Beautiful beach,"This is a beautiful beach, we were not able to swim because the ""Stingers"" broke through the netting and they closed the swimming area, but you can walk for miles.  Excellent bird watching, stop by Surfies for sushi rolls and a beer when you are done!"
Get up early and go for a walk,The best early morning walk... walked nearly the whole distance there and back.  The walk is just sensational.
Beautiful Scenery,"Visited the beach a few times, scenery is stunning- typical FNQ - but we were  slaughtered by insects during the afternoons. Don't leave home without the aeroguard 🙊 and don't expect to swim in the ocean during stinger season"
Excellent ,Walked lots on the 4 mile beach.lovely beach. Sea in the cordoned off area lovely and warm. Beach is great to walk on. Natural beach can beat some of beaches in Hawaii
Beautiful place wonderful for walks,Had a fantastic time here the views are beautiful the walks great  the beach cleanish except for the seaweed umbrella and sun loungers forty dollers all day best time to go is november to january but be careful of the stingers jelly fish wonderful wonderful wonderful.
Beautiful wild beach but wear walking shoes for box jelly fish,"We were there in December so it was box jelly season. It was safer to walk along edge in runners , even though there are bottles of vinegar at surf club you still have to visit hospital if you get stung. But it was worthwhile just to have the vista of the beach and landscape in its natural form, no housing or hotels can be seen as they are on other side of little forest and road. I absolutely loved my swim in the safe enclosure near surf club, the water was so clear and clean and hardly anybody there as December is low season in Port Douglas. I'll be back again just to have the pleasure of solitude, lovely weather and the expanse of 4 mile beach. There is also a lovely cafe across the road near the enclosure pool."
Beautiful beach but a shame I couldn’t swim in it,"I had a few late afternoon walks on the beach. It was roughly a 4km walk from where we were near the Bruno reiweg entrance to the lifesaver tower and beach nets. It was very relaxing and tranquil. I enjoyed watching the crabs do their thing on beach as there were little balls of sand the crabs make everywhere all over the beach.My routine was to do the walk along the beach, enjoy happy hour in town and then walk back. Very relaxing and refreshing."
Gorgeous walk from one end to the other,If you go to Port Douglas and dont go on Four Mile Beach then why did you visit Port Douglas?The beach is a gently curving stretch of sand that takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other.If you walk to town from Four Mile Beach Park (near Barrier/Reef St) then make sure you also head up the steps to the newly reopenned scenic walk. It has breathtaking views over Port Douglas and out to sea.If you walk from town to 4 Mile residential area then make sure that you pop in to The Beach Shack (if open) as this bar/restaurant is great.
Closed because of stingera,"The beach was closed because of stingers, but that’s actually pretty cool. Love stingers they are so fascinating. There’s also a lot of coconut palms and some hard work could actually pay off and give you a coconut.Lost my Ray Bans tho..."
Pretty beach with risk,"Balmy 28’ water, tiny netted section you can swim if you dare risk stingers and crocs. Patrolled by lifesavers. Beach chairs and umbrellas available at a price."
Beautiful,"Lifesavers on duty, a very beautiful, peaceful place to be. Early morning walks, walking tracks with places to stop and over look Four Mile beach and the Coral sea. A lovely little cafe across the road to relax in and look at the beach."
Beware the stingers,"Four Mile beach is lovely. The life guards are helpful and the beach itself was good. Please try to pick up any rubbish you see. It is annoying that people walk past other people's rubbish as it can detract from the natural beauty. Finding shoes, plastic and a toothbrush was disappointing from the perspective that people don't seem to care about our natural environment."
Lovely scenic beach,Swam in tepidly warm waters and were wowed by the scenery that the beach backs onto. The netted (safe swimming area) is relatively small but does protect against jellyfish risk
Long walks on the beach,Staying in accomodation near the beach was fantastic. We were able to take leisurely walks every day along this beautiful beach. Looking forward to returning in a dry season.
Four Mile Beach ,Maybe it's the time of the year that we visited Four Mile Beach which was Janurary but I was disappointed with how much seaweed there was in the water and other things that where getting washed up on shore. I felt disgusted been in the water. Its quite a shame considering the water was nice and warm. But like I said it could be the month that we visited this beach..
Beautiful beach and views,We went for a walk one evening before dinner with my husband and toddler ho loved walking along the beach. It wasn’t very crowded at all and lots of people relaxing and walking dogs or doing yoga. Shame we didn’t make it to the beach again in the day but would definitely recommend.
Best beach ever,Stayed at pullman sea temple 6 nights and to escape noisy kids came to the beach which was kid free yayyy! Beautiful beach
A beautiful beach,"The beach here is beautiful and with a very nice sunset light. The reserved area for swimming is safe and shallow, great for kids and enjoying warm water."
Be@utiful,"What a gorgeous beach, wander on your own or sit by the netting to swim safely. Great photo ops in any direction. SLC right on hand.One of the reasons for visiting port douglas"
A beach you can’t fully enjoy ,"Looks like a tropical paradise - but a potentially deadly one. Especially during the summer month you cannot dip into the water (apart from a small net area), as you would risk being (potentially fatally) stung by jellyfish. There are also some occasional crocodile sightings. The advantage is, that you can have a large stretch of beautiful white sand beach almost for yourself ..."
Four Mile Beauty,"Walked from our hotel to the Beach. This was a walk in heaven!  Sand and sea on one side  , and  rolling hills and tropical vegetation on the other!  Really gorgeous."
Pure nature!,"Awesome beach, pure nature and wild! Not good to swim, but that’s ok, still worth a walk from the beggining to the end!"
Nice beach ,Nice beach to swim at as well as to walk along either in the morning or in the evening. It is very pleasant with the Bush on one side
Tropical Paradise,"What a fantastic beach, clean & unspoilt with a dedicated swimming area and lifeguard station due to the crocs & jelly fish."
Four Mile Beach,"Visited the Four Mile beach on our way back to Cairns. We stopped for a dip I. The water, they have nice enclosure where you can swim in during December due to stingers. Lovely area I was expected cleaner sand but this particular day a bit of seaweed washed up along the banks of the water, still a picturesque view."
Lovely quiet beach,Beach is a very short walk from centre of port Douglas On our visits very few others were there. Beach has a netted area for safe swimming away from the dangers of stingers which are quite prevalent at this time of yearExtremely pretty beach with great views over the ocean
Lovely drive along beach hugging road way,Winding road hugging the northern beach. Scenic sea view. Road it self is good. But should not exceed the speed as there are many sharp bends and road get narrow at certain places. Should be even more careful driving when dark (no road lights).
Spectacular ,"I have been to many beaches across the world and there is nothing quite like 4 mile beach it is absolutely stunning, when we went it was stingray season so no one was swimming in the water and there was only about 4 people walking the beach which made it that much more perfect like an untouched piece of nature surrounded by beautiful mountains and forest, would definitely recommend"
Great Beach,Lovely beach. Stinger nets in operation so safe swimming only available where the net was in place. Clean golden sand. Restaurant available as are sun loungers and sun umbrella which is essential if you are staying any length of time.
How can you miss the beach?,"We went to the top of the hill, and looked down on Four Mile Beach, what views! We then walked down the beach via the path. At one point going down you need to head right if you want to get to Four Mile Beach. It is less than 3/4 of a mile and a very easy walk. Once there you can admire the beauty of the beach and you can get into the water, but be sure you are in the right section to avoid jelly fish! We would have liked to stay longer but we wanted to grab lunch and do some shopping before heading back to our hotel. This is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world."
Stunning,Great beach to swim or just lay on the sand.  Make sure you take the walkway around the point...a great way to experience the beauty of the place.
lovely walk,a beautiful beach to stroll along. definitely no swimming for us out of the supervised netted area at this time of year. water temp is quite warm too but a lovely walk none the less.
"Gorgeous, free, a bit of shade if you want it, and the jellynets!","My stay at this beach was quite nice. The sand was super soft and free of debris. And coming in the afternoon, there were some spots shaded by trees/cliffs if you want to avoid the hot sun.A highlight was the net for keeping box jellyfish out of the swimming area, which is apparently monitored by the lifeguard for most of the day."
Amazing.,"Awesome views, very lively beach lots of joggers, people on bikes etc. incredible settingCan’t wait to go back"
Beautiful ,"Beautiful beach, nice lookout area, There is a noted area to swim in if you're wary if the stingersNice and quiet and sereneMangroves reaching the sea"
The beach is beautiful.,A good place for water sports. Many beaches near a river mouth have salt water crocks. we stayed just off the beach with lots of shopping and restaurants close by.
Beautiful scenic beach,"This beach location is amazing.  The water was warm, and loungers and umbrellas were readily available for rent."
Great beach ,Great beach for swimming. The water was so nice and warm. Lots of shade cover from the trees in the afternoon but they do have beach chairs and umbrellas for hire.
Amazing and fun Experience,This tour is highly recommended for everyone and anyone. If you have never been on a Segway you must do this tour. Was a lovely and smooth ride along the beautiful “Four Mile Beach” also very easy to learn and ride. Overall we had an amazing time with ‘Anthony’ 😊
Beautiful beach ,I stayed away from the populated areas of the beach and was able to simply enjoy the beautiful surroundings.
Great walking,Loved walking the beach in the afternoon when the tide was right out. Beautiful beach and you can walk into town.
Swim/cycle/run/sunbathe,Can do it all here. Get up at sunrise and cycle (any mountain bike will do) or run along the beach (trainers are fine - don’t need to be bare foot!)The enclosed swimming area with lifeguards puts your mind at ease
Stunning Beach,Four Mile Beach in Port Douglas is a beautiful clean beach ideal for all water sports and swimming. Nice sandy beach to walk along and a gorgeous view from Flagstaff Hill.
Long beach walk ,"Just did the long beach walk in the surf , stunning beach with coconut palms and amazing bird life Just us like a desert island beach.  Perfect"
Absolutely Beautiful Beach,"This clean, wide sand beach seems to go on and on.  Nice waves, warm water (in October) and waving palms trees and other flora.  Just a lovely place."
Nice beach,"This is, as the name suggests, a lovely long beach which, when we visited, was clean mainly due to the tide reaching the vegetation and palm trees along its edge. There was some isolated debris when we visited but this was mainly drifting wood. Not a lot of dry sand to lie on due to the height of the tides but great for children to play on including digging holes etc. It appears most people walk this beach rather than sunbathe. Several cafes etc nearby. A good place to visit to watch the sun go down."
Never disappoints ,My suggestion is to climb up to the lookout and take in the birds eye view of 4 mile beach. Its beautiful. Stinger nets in place and honestly swam at Port for the first time in 3 holidays. Never felt comfortable to swim ordinarily as Crocs have been spotted in the sea on our previous visits. This time I felt safe swimming in the stinger nets. The sea is beautiful!
REALLY GOOD,"We visited a lot of beaches from Townsville to Cape Tribulation and this was one of the best in our opinion. Nice form sand, great for walking along, particularly around low tide. The beach is very long so you can go on a decent walk. The sea was pleasant to swim in and there were no big waves while we were there. The beach is so long and wide (at low tide) that you can easily find a bit of seclusion if you want to meditate or read quietly. Nice cafes and restaurant at the town end where it was a little more crowded."
Wonderful Port Douglas ,"A great laid back beach and town. Lot's of great accomodation, plenty of places to eat surrounded by world heritage reef & rainforest."
Best Beach in Oz,Safe swimming in summer in the nets. Very little surf or swell. Beautiful sand with lovely foreshore park.Next to the surf club and cafes nearby.Beautiful and untouched beach.
Walking the beach and trail,The beach is beautiful to walk as well as the trail that goes the other direction.  Has a bunch of steps but is a nice path along the cliff area .
Stunning ,"Love this beach , well maintained and clean with a nice cool breeze , great chairs to hire if you need them and the sand is like a fine powder . Nice penned in safety area too xx"
"Lovely beach, white sands",Lovely Long Beach to stroll along & take in the views. Clear waters ... no stingers at this time of year... warm water too! Recommended
Great beach for a stroll ,"Probably Port Douglas most popular and pristine beach great for a walk and swim when stinger nets are in, beach can vary depending on the weather on a nice day nice blue sea and white sand beach on a choppy day water is darker and not so beautiful."
Great walk on a flat sandy beach,"We've walked many beaches in our lifetimes but this one is among the very best.  Flat, lovely sand with friendly people met along the way.  Safe.  Wear a hat and use suntan lotion - it's easy to get a sunburn out there!"
Nice Beach,"This beach is patrolled by surf life-savers. Lovely golden sand. Safe for swimming BUT be sure to read ALL the warning signs on all of the North Queensland beaches. If in doubt, check with life-savers."
beautiful beach,We were walking along the main street which ended to Four mile beach.you can see lots of coconut trees alongside the beach and many coconuts on the beach. if you have time try 4 mile beach Lookout. you may see a Cruise passing by.
Worth a visit ,Beautiful beach. Water very warm. Not a bit of litter. So clean. If you go for a walk there take water.
Short beach covered in overgrown trees,"Was not much of a beach. Nice to walk along and dip toes in maybe, but have to duck and weave around trees"
A truly relaxing place,"With the exception of Cable Beach in Broome, Western Australia, this has to be my favourite beach in Australia.A nice stroll down  the beach does  wonders to your mental health."
Magical 4 Mile Beach,"The beach is very clean and has an area for swimming which is patrolled by Life Guards. There are always quite a few people taking an early morning walk along the sand. Also recommended is getting up early to watch an absolutely amazing sunrise. Take your camera for that. At the north end of the beach - near Macrossan Street, there is also a pathway to a lookout which is also worth a visit."
Paradise on Earth,"Many many years ago, living in rainy London,  I saw a photo in a holiday brochure of a location that seemed so distant and exotic, it seemed inconceivable that I would ever go there.  That image always stayed with me until finally,  in 2012 I stepped onto the soft sands of Four Mile Beach for the first time and said ""I made it! I got here!""  Perhaps it's for this reason that even in the times I'ver been there since,  I still feel bewitched by the place and have a special connection with it.  Either way,  There are few more idyllic locations on the Australian Coast.  On a clear sunny day,  the sand is white,  the water is warm,  the palm trees swing seductively over the shore, and you could be forgiven for thinking you were in Fiji or Hawaii, and the view from the end at Trinity Bay lookout,  is a sight not to be missed.  A truly stunning place!"
Plenty of space and clean,"White soft sand, safe swimming area with lifeguards and heaps of space to walk and relax....four miles of it I assume! You can also hire beds and sun shades. Cafes etc right next to beach too for drinks and lunch."
Four Mile Beach,Beautiful beach to spend the day. We were there in Oct which a great time of the year. Weather is awesome and the risk of stingers is low. You can rent beach chairs and an umbrella for the day. The beach is close to the town centre with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. Can walk from beach to lookout point. Stunning views. Loved Four Mile beach!
Friends and family holiday,"We stayed across the road from Four Mile Beach so we’re able to access it at all times of the day and evenings. At one end are stairs to a pathway to a small cove. This walk is quite strenuous but provides wonderful views across the ocean. It is about 1.25 kilometers to the cove and is a beautiful walk. Also walking along the beach very early or at dusk is amazing. There is the occasional turtle or dolphins can sometimes be seen. The beach is great for children and the sand is so soft. From about November and through the wet season, the beach has stingers so can only be swum in where there are nets. This is aniconic and much photographed beach."
Beautiful  Beach,Great huge beach and not too many people so at times you can have the whole beach to yourself. Barbecue pits and great swimming!
Stunning beach in a beautiful town!,"Four Mile Beach offers a beautifully relaxing vibe but beware, these are crocodile waters so caution must be taken."
Beautiful Beach,"Definitely visit this beach. The water is beautiful, the sand is clean and it is very relaxing. My husband and I spent many days relaxing on the sand. We also hiked up to the lookout and took some great pictures. If you are visiting Port Douglas, definitely check out this beach"
Beautiful beach 🏖 ,A great beach to walk along it’s long it’s nice and great at sunrise and sunset 🌅 Lots of people around which is nice in the mornings to say hi to people walking past... There were dogs not sure if it is a dog friendly beach but very nice to see!
Beautiful beach for morning walks.,We stayed a block off the beach so I did my morning walk there everyday. Go early to beat the heat. Not really a swimming beach due to stingers and sharks. Pay attention to the warning signs and flags to know when andwhere to swim.
Great beach,The beach is supported by lifeguards. It is quite assessable with a ramp and then a heavy mat from the concrete ramp down a fair way to the water. Toilets close by plus the lifesaving club for meals and drinks
Great beach,"Lovely beach, we purchased a deck chair and umbrella as it was a hot sunny day, the beach is surf life saver patrolled where we swam the water was warm and very clear the day we were there. Highly recommend a visit."
One of the most beautiful beaches we've seen!,"Four Mile Beach did not disappoint!  Stunning beach, lifeguards on duty, so swimming and water sports are safe.  We've seen other beautiful beaches around the world,  and this was as beautiful as the pictures we had seen."
Head out early to beat the sun,Amazing walk in the morning to see the life savers and umbrella people setting up for the day. Do the walk around the peninsula from the market area all the way around to Four Mile Beach. We did one way in bare feet and put our shoes on for the return but my calves were aching for days afterwards!Do wear/take your swimmers to have a dip between the flags on your way home.
Stunned ,Beautiful beach - was very windy during our visit but managed one day on the sun beds. Great for walking in the sea and also cyclng
Warm ,The water was clean and warm. Very nice beach for a walk or just resting with a book. Plenty of trees to protect from the sun.
Stunning 4 mile beach,"Beautiful walking , running on tnis beautiful stretch of beach. Not a great swimmimg beach but more of body surfing with lovely warm water. September there were no stingers when we were there."
My fave walking beach,"I've been to Port Douglas 7 times now just can't get enough of the place.  The weather, the food, the beach why would you not.  Best beach around for long walks to clear the head."
Beach Time,A pristine beach that seems to go on forever. There is a safe swimming area assisted by the life guards. Pay attention to the notices about stingers and crocs but don't let that stop you from having fun. The Aussies do want you to stay safe.
Nice but windy,Probably one of the better beaches this far north in Queensland but no where near as nice as those in Western Australia & we don’t have crocodiles or stingers that can kill you !
Beautiful place ,Beautiful long beach of corral sand. Used by swimmers in a stinger cage only at the northern end otherwise apart from the odd early morning runners you have it pretty much to yourself!
Picture perfect,"We were staying 5 minutes walk from this amazing beach. We were lucky, no stingers or nasty things that bite in October. So relaxing and just like the postcard."
Beautiful beach. Well worth going at low tide,Great beach! Worth walking the whole distance and back. Recommend going at low tide as high tide doesn’t leave too much sand. I also ran on the beach and the sand is hard. The photo I took speaks for itself.
Long beach,"Not a lot to say really,   Its a long beach with lots of people walking on it.  At low tide its quite easy to walk on as the sand is quite hard.   Good place for jogging if thats your thing."
a beautiful beach with rows of coconut groves.  The beach is great for walking,One of the most beautiful sunrises to capture on camera.  Though make sure to not just sit on the many beach side chairs - they are not free to sit on.  Just a tip
Late day walk,Enjoyed all of Port Douglas- including a walk on this beautiful place in the culture and history of the townClose to our hotel and easy access
A convenient delightful walk,Walked along the full length of this beach every day during our 5 day stay and enjoyed the ease of walking on firm sand and delightful scenery.  Saw many people use bikes and lots of locals walking their dogs
Beautiful ,A beautiful beach well patrolled. At this time of year you feel quite safe swimming between the flags.
Iconic BeCh,4 mile beach is the iconic Aussie beach with Long stretches of sand and blue ocean. It is life guard controlled so swim where the flags are position. You are able to hire equipment  for either sitting on the beach or water activities. Early morning yoga classes are also available.Great beach for long walks or jogging.
Nice beach but dirty water unfortunately due to rain,"I thought it was great how there is easy access, especially a carpet or paved footpath for wheelchair access. We come from New Zealand and are spoilt for choice when it comes to beautiful beaches, unfortunately during our visit in July there had been heavy rain and the water was dirty. I’m sure on a lovely day with clean water it would be a lot more appealing. The beachfront is large with plenty of space for activities and kids to play."
great beach,"great place for a morning or afternoon walk. you hire surf skies , surf boards, stand up paddle boards, banana lounges and beach umbrellas  eating places very close"
Beach stroll,"Went for a lovely stroll along beach, absolutely beautiful view. Reasonable priced chair umbrella hire. Was disappointed no activities were available to hire."
Golden sands,"Magical beach to watch the sun rise, keep an eye out for dolphins at play as the sun rises, easy to walk along down to the township"
Walking on the beach,good sandy and clean beach - water was safe - lifegaurds present and beach umbrellas and lounges available for hire
Paradise,"We made a point of getting up before the Sun (06.28) and watching an amazing sunrise every day.. Coupled with a leisurely walk to the end and back of roughly 2 hours it was a great way to avoid ""excess luggage!"
Morning walk,"Loved the walk on the fabulous mile long beach...... pristine considering the amount of tourist........nice, safe, clean, and relaxing  beach  to swim in."
paradise,four mile beach is a little piece of paradise  beautiful white sand beautiful blue waters stunning scenery a gorgeous place to see a sunrise or sunset
Beautiful!,Spent a relaxing afternoon at four mile beach. The surrounding mountains is a beautiful backdrop. The waves are gentle & the water lovely. The palms & foliage provide excellent shade. Highly recommend.
Great place to relax or simply walk ,I forgot my towels so i walked along this beach..  could take an hr to cross the beach. The stretch of sand is great.. also recommend to walk up to the view point
Lovely large beach,"I stayed a short walk from the beach for several days and went for several walks along here, and also hired a bike and rode the entire length. I did not swim (my hotel advised against it - probably to protect themselves more than anything!).It’s a lovely, expansive beach with coconut palms lining it and firm sand. The patterns everywhere from the sand bubbler crabs was something I had not seen before and lovely to look at.The beach is busier at the northern end near town where it is patrolled, but plenty of people spread out along the entire length walking, jogging, playing with kids, fishing, swimming, kite surfing, riding and sunbathing (not a good idea in the Australian sun!)"
Wonderful beach,Sunrise is beautiful on this beach.  At lower tide wonderful place to walk or run. Sand is hard.  Great views and beach is never that crowded.  Highly recommend time on beach
Awesome Family Beach,Patrolled beach with loungers and umbrellas available for hire. Calm water and wide beachfront means plenty of play time for the kids.
Beautiful tropical beach,"This is a stunning stretch of coastline, perfect for walking, exercising the dog, sun bathing, relaxing .... but not swimming. Although there were swimmers braving the waters when we were there as the marine stinger risk was at its lowest. Signs at the entrances to the beach warn beach goers of the presence of marine stingers and crocodiles. However, there are lifeguards on duty and in the height of the season there are stinger nets too. We loved walking the length of this beautiful flat beach bordered by palm trees and other lush vegetation. A must-do in Port Douglas!"
4 mile beach,I think I walked the 4 miles. Then again I walked back so I think I did 8miles. Where does it start from and end. As I walked as far as the mangroves.
Such fun!,"My sister and I saw the Segway tour on 4 mile beach and decided we would like to give it a go! All participants were met at a park where one by one we were trained on how to operate a Segway safely. It can be a little daunting at first but all of us were riding in no time and it really isn’t difficult at all and confidence quickly grows. Wow rode down to 4 mile beach and had a great time riding up to the south end. We mainly rode on the hard sand but we also went on the softer sand and in vv shallow water. We had to keep an eye out for things to avoid...such as holes, logs etc but wasn’t a problem. We also had some freer time in some sections of the beach so we could have a bit of freestyle!There was a lot of emphasis on safety, which was good and I never felt unsafe at all. My sister and I had great fun and would thoroughly recommend if visiting beautiful Pt Douglas!"
Stunning beach (weather depending),"Our first day called for a walk on the beach.We win with the weather and time if year, so it was an absolute picture postcard. Beautiful blue water and sky, glorious green foreshore and mountain hinterland.Clearly popular, dozens and dozens of people out for their morning constitutional.Time if year also meant no stinger worries.Other comments about water temp in August must be relative... We're from VIC and the water felt beautiful to me."
Worth a visit ,We visited on a breezier day but still worth the stop to marvel in its beauty. It’s a pretty clean beach and a lovely way to unwind.
Four mile beach ,Was okay... Nice mountains and scenery. It’s not turquoise water or white sand or anything like that! Depends what you’re expecting - some of the photos are doctored for sure! I don’t know...  the warning signs of jellyfish and crocodiles make you a tad uneasy lol ... not my first choice of beach! Was Pretty to walk down and splash around in though. Water was pretty cold in August you couldn’t just jump on in!
Morning drive,"We drove from Palm Cove to Port Douglas for a day st at the beach. Was nice place except for the gusty winds. Very choppy waves as well so unable to stay with young children. We saw the potential. However, perhaps check wind report if possible in order not to make same mistake we did."
Perfect beach to walk along,What a lovely stretch of beach.Very firm sand so very easy to walk along.We also swam between the flags of this well patrolled beach.
Stunning beach - swim between the flags,This is a very beautiful stretch of beach and you can easily swim here (recommend staying between the patrolled flags).  Beach lounges and umbrellas also available near the surf club for a fee.
Beautiful Beach,"We visited the beach just to have a look.Although not the best beach we've seen, it is one of the best in the area.The beach is patrolled and there are umbrellas for shade along with lazy boys for sun baking.  You can also view this beach and surrounding area from the lookout at flagstaff hill."
Beautiful Beach,"Beautiful beach, not too crowded, good facilities. Sand is too wet to lie on and beds a little expensive for frequent trips at 40 dollars for 2 with an umbrella. We are a family of 4."
Great way to spend a Sunday morning,What a lovely beach spent a very enjoyable 90 mins walking 3.5miles on golden white sand. Views are amazing rain forest overlooking the beach making a fantastic back drop. Make it a must do while in Port Douglas
Geat beach for walk and swim,"This is a great beach for a very long walk or a liesurely stroll, and on a not so windy day great for a swim in the cooler months when the stingers are less of a risk. The water temperature is very pleasant at the moment at 23 degrees, much better then the beaches in the far south NSW."
Great sandy beach,We went for a afternoon walk down the beach all the views are awesome Will spend a day on the beach as it so great
Sunrise and picnics,"We visited the beach twice today, once to watch sunrise at the comparatively sociable time of 6:38, and later on for an evening beach picnic as an alternative to pricey dining in Port Douglas. The beach stretches out as far as you can see and is still relatively sparsely populated despite the greater numbers of tourists in Port Douglas, compared to the last time we were here ten years ago. Back then it was jellyfish season and a lot of the beach was inaccessible, no such issues this time and we were able to stand in the warm Pacific water. It was a bit windy for our picnic so it would have been a good idea to make sure everyone had something warm to wear, despite this omission everyone agreed it made a nice change. There is something special about making a hole in the sand for your wine cup so that it doesn’t get blown over! As we were leaving the sun had set and the moon was reflecting on the waves which was just beautiful."
Fantastic,Great beach to walk and relax on. Come at the right time of year the ocean is great to swim in. Unfortunately there is always some selfish people laying on the beach who play music thinking that everyone wants to listen to it. And also some selfish people kicking balls around...But it is truly a great place.
Best beach,"The most beautiful beach you will ever see.  Great for walking, running, bike riding, sunbathing and swimming.  It is such a beautiful place and there is plenty of space for everyone."
Beautiful and Accessible,"Every day I was in Port Douglas this beach was a daily destination.  Ride the bike, walk or run or just lie and soak up the sun this has it all."
Beach,"That’s all that needs to be said. The beach is good. It’s open, it’s not rough or challenging, so good for family, children, older folks too. But basically, it is just a good beach, such as Australia has so many to offer, and not crowded like so many other parts of the world. Beach!"
Beautiful beach,"Great when wind not blowing. Hire a bike and ride across the hard packed sands. Lots of places to stay and lots of activities to do. Ride a bike, beach yoga or just sit and relax."
Lovely Beach,Been a bit windy this year but a top spot for walking.  Occasionally they clear the beach if a crocodile spotted but not too often.  We usually end our walk with a coffee at the excellent surf club who do good breakfasts and lunches.  The staff are lovely and friendly.
Nice beach,Top tip go after 1 o’clock for half price sun lounges and parasols and they will actually be a reasonable priceIt’s a nice beach which is well maintained and free of litter there are one or two nice looking bars near the beach and the rest of town is only a short walk away I’d recommend it for a day if you’re lucky with the weather but on the two days we went it did seem quite windy so maybe this is something that the beach struggles withOverall definitely worth a look
Great beach for families,The long and wide stretch of sandy areas is great for kids to run around. The beach is safe as it gradually deepens. Toilet blocks and shower available close by.
This is paradise!,"I know this sounds cliché, but this really is paradise.  I am not normally a beach person, but Four Mile Beach wasted no time in winning me over!Have you ever enjoyed a game of beach cricket while colourful butterflies flutter around you?Have you ever experienced the incoming tide gently rushing in between the spokes of your bicycle wheels as you cycle along the shoreline?  Due to the beach's super-fine sand, we were able to effortlessly cycle without getting bogged.Have you ever been able to say ""This is really paradise"" after having walked way way way out towards the reef at low tide, and looking back at the stunning view of the surrounding mountains and beach?We experienced this and more at Four Mile Beach.We holidayed down the southern end, although the beach is peaceful at both ends - even around the Sheraton Mirage.We were up every morning admiring the sunrises, and there was just a nice sprinkling of people walking their dogs or jogging.  The kids I was holidaying with were out gathering shells and finding crabs for hours as the tide changed.  We travelled in July, which made this possible.Take a drive up to Trinity Bay Lookout for a postcard-worthy view of the whole of Four Mile Beach.How I wish this piece of paradise was closer to Sydney.  There's something for everyone at this beautiful beach."
Picturesque,"4 mile beach is beautiful a great walk it's good to look at things around where you come in to find your way back, can be a bit hard. Great to watch the kite surfers as well."
Lacking,"Maybe on nice, windfree day this beach would be worth a walk along. Seen better, but everyone goes as its Port Douglas. Cannot swim for some of the year so extremely frustrating when hot and looks inviting."
Wow,It is so long and empty. Lovely hard sand to walk on. Views both ways are great. A fantastic early morning place. Worth walking along.
"Gorgeous beach, not crowded, good facilitties","I'm so glad we traveled an hour North from Cairns to stay in quieter (but not sleepy) Port Douglas. This was suggestion by my Aussie friend in US. This beach was beautiful, there was life guard present and there were two restaurants, bars and public bathrooms there. Pure bliss. Note there are signs with vinegar bottles attached for those who may be stung by jelly fish. But in Winter (July) they are not present."
Meh,"Decent place for a walk or a run, but as a beach it is not very usable. Swimming is not really a goer, nor is surfing"
Stroll along the beach,"Wow, what a beach, plenty of people but it is so vast you never feel crowded. Beautiful views in every direction and spotlessly clean. Just a few steps from the bustling streets of Port Douglas but it is like a different world."
Nice beach,We had a.nice time strolling along the beach as well as skim board and try windsurfing. There’s a van that rents sup and other boards. Water is warm and we were lucky to have sunny warm days.
Superb ,"Loved doing the four mile beach walk. The day we did it the weather was lovely, clear blue sky. We took some superb photos & it is a great way if you are looking for something special & getting exercise at the same time. I would say if you are staying in Port Douglas this walk is a must, most enjoyable."
Palm trees to the beach :),"Very pretty, clean beach.  Coconut trees and palm trees to the beach line. Resorts are hidden back from the tree line so the views are beautiful. Comfortable to walk without shoes. Lots of little crabs and their holes. A special mat goes from the footpath onto the sand - looked like it was for wheelchair/ prams.  A drinking fountain catered for pets and humans. No toilets, but there was a breakfast cafe that probably has some. Beach equipment was for hire in a portable caravan near the flags. Morning yoga sessions at a few different places on the beach. A great way to start the day!"
Great beach,"Lovely beach. Nice firm sand, good for walking or bicycle riding.  Water nice for swimming with caution."
Famous 4 Mile Beach?,"It was a choppy windy day, so the beach was not quite as friendly as I had hoped.  There were many people enjoying the water.  I was impressed that there were sun lounges for hire.  Well done Port Douglas, I have been wanting to see sun lounges all the way up the coast from Brisbane, but no other place I have visited has had them.  It is so nice just to be able to sit in comfort, read or relax without having to actually lay on the sand!  Thank you!"
Swim if you dare!,Big patch of beach. Lovely. Just worries with all the signs to be beware of crocs and jellyfish. The sand is beautiful and water was pleasant.
Just get out there!!,"Beautiful spot with endless possibilities, go enjoy a walk, a paddle or make some game up, just go!!!!"
Decent Beach,"Five minutes walk from centre of Town. Dry Season the beach has Life Savers.Good for children as there is no surf. As the name suggests, the beach is four miles long. It is a good beach for enjoying the sun or having a swim."
Staying at the Sheraton Mirage Hotel,"A great location with beautiful scenery. We are spending a week here - bed and breakfast buffet. The staff are very helpful and it’s clean. The room has all the amenities you need and a decent size fridge. In-house food a bit pricey but coffee and tea are on tap for guests. It’s worth joining the Bonvoy Marriott Hotel Group (free) before coming as you’ll get 10%off food/drinks bought at hotel. We hired a car for the day $70 (£40) to go sightseeing - transport to and from the town of Port Douglas $5.00  (£3.00), each way pp works out rather expensive- it would have been a nice gesture to have free shuttle buses for guests. Alternatively you can walk along the four-mile beach to town. (Approx 1.8 miles away)."
Afternoon walk.,Beautiful walk along the beach with a small area fur swimming that is carefully manned by life guards. Well worth a swim and a walk in the town as well.
Perfect morning walk from hotel to Macrossan st,This is perfect to start the day. Yoga   Bike walk or run. Walk to town from Sheraton and catch the shuttle back
Beautiful ,"This beach like most Australian beaches is clean and beautiful, while not really a surfing beach due to a low swell it is great for kids and swimmers it was patrolled when we were there also had chairs and umbrellas for hireIf you want a nice secluded spot ther is plenty of room up the southetn end or  for a great view walk up to the lookout at the northern  end of the beach."
Simply stunning,"A wide expanse of firm sand fringes by palm trees. Great for walking, running, building sand castles, splashing in the waves. We loved it and our kids adored it"
BEWARE OF CROCODILES,"Four Mile Beach is beautiful. However, it does not tolerate fools. My mate and I visited Four Mile Beach during a trip to Australia in July 2019. We arrived at a protected area of the beach at around 1500 or so on 16 July 2019. The area of the beach we came to had safety nets, lifeguards and maybe about 30 - 40 persons swimming in the protected area.We were preparing to swim a few laps in the protected area (that is, the area with the marine stinger safety nets.) The lifeguard sounded an alarm as my mate and I were approaching the water and ordered everyone to immediately exit. The lifeguard then said that there was a potential crocodile sighting. We initially thought that this warning was a preponderance of caution. Then, about 7 - 10 minutes later, we saw a crocodile swimming maybe 50 - 100 meters from shore.Yes, you read that correctly. We saw a crocodile.We initially thought we must be seeing something else. Then, we saw the spikes on its tail. We honestly could not believe what we were seeing. The lifeguard ordered everyone to stay away from the water and then activated one of his drones. My mate and I were standing near the lifeguard as he was operating his drone. The crocodile looked like it was maybe 4 meters in length. The lifeguard then said that the beach is closed for swimming. I wish I had a video of this. Sadly, I had left my mobile phone in my hotel for safety reasons. This was one of the most incredible and awestruck things I have ever seen. The crocodile was a truly majestic animal. But it is not something I wish to encounter while swimming at a beach. My mate and I send our warm congratulations to the Port Douglas lifeguards for keeping such a close watchful eye. They must have a very stressful job.Four Mile Beach is beautiful. However, it is not a location to be taken lightly. DO NOT SWIM OUTSIDE OF THE PROTECTED AREAS. OBEY THE LIFEGUARDS AT ALL TIMES. AND DO NOT IGNORE THE WARNING SIGNS. In the summer months, Four Mile Beach can be infested with extremely dangerous marine stringers. Crocodiles can be in the water at any time of the year. We came in the winter months, after all. If you come to Port Douglas, by all means enjoy Four Mile Beach. But here is a general rule - if you see safety nets and life guards, you should be okay to swim between the warning flags. If you see a beautiful stretch of Four Mile Beach on a beautiful day with absolutely nobody in the water, there is a reason why nobody is in the water. Four Mile Beach is breathtakingly beautiful. But it is not a place to abandon one's wits and better judgment."
Ideal for young families,"This is an ideal beach for young families who are prepared to take a modicum of care.Calm water, inside the Great Barrier Reef), patrolled at the Macrossan Street end, vast space for walking and playing.Swimming is fine in June, July and August, as long as you are sensible.  (You are in the tropics.  A crocodile was spotted off the patrolled section of the beach last Tuesday and the beach was closed for the afternoon.)Swim only during the day, in the patrolled section and you will be fine.If you are not a water animal, there are beach chairs, cushions and umbrellas for hire as well as cricket sets, paddle boards, large inner tubes, kayaks and bocce sets for the more active.This beach is ideal for a stroll of any length"
Clean beach with plenty of room to spread out.,We enjoyed exploring 4 Mile Beach during our stay in Port Douglas.  It is an expansive beach that is extremely clean and with plenty of families running around.  The sand is packed tight enough that you can ride bikes along the beach.  There is a section of beach patrolled by lifeguards and an area to rent surfboards and rafts.
Amazing,This is one of the prettiest beaches we have ever seen. We walked it all one day. We watched two sunrises while we were there. We also went out and had a champagne toast our last night and found the Southern Cross constellation.
"Nice beach, nothing spectacular","I suppose I am spoilt living so close to Torquay, Bancoora and Ocean Grove beaches in Victoria, so this beach did not impress me that much.  The water is very salty - it stung my sons legs and eyes.  There were no waves, it was very windy as it is so open.  Yes it was a nice beach and worth having a look, but Victorian beaches are so much better!!"
Holidaying in Port Douglas,Took a number of walks at this beautiful and tranquil beach. Particularly early in the morning to see the sun rise. It was well worth getting up early for it.
Relaxing beach walk,"We walked the beach, starting about halfway along from our Ramada resort. Head south to the end of the beach or north to go into Port Douglas township. At the northern end there is a great walk around the headland, with a lookout at top over Port Douglas."
Beautiful beach but beware!,"We stayed in a unit just 5 minutes walk from the south part of 4 mile beach which is absolutely stunning - silver sand, lovely rolling surf and fringed with palm trees. It was a fab place for an early morning run when the wind was gentle and the sun warm. In the afternoon the onshore wind got up and it wasn’t ideal for sitting around with young kids as you could get shot-blasted with windblown sand!At the north end of the beach there are lifeguards. We saw families having fun in the late afternoon surf. There are points with medical vinegar at every point of entry to the beach but the stinger threat is much lower in July. However this afternoon we, and dozens of people, witnessed a huge crocodile swimming parallel to the beach about 100m offshore. The red flag was up and.no-one was swimming! This was a great reminder that the beach is part of the natural environment. This part of Queensland has beautiful wild places in abundance to enjoy with respect, and we must not abuse them by littering, overpopulating or polluting."
Wonderful beach,"Best beach. Clean, quiet, safe to swim. Peaceful to walk. Lovely views from the woodland walk. Perfect white powdery sand."
Beautiful Beach,"We walked this beach while visiting Port Douglas for the day.  What an amazing place!  The sand was packed enough to walk with ease.  The area between the flags was busy but not overcrowded for high season.  My kids rented boogie boards from a vendor and decided to swim spur of the moment.  The water was warmer in the Australian winter than the US pacific coast gets in the summer.  In addition, the beach is right at the end of the esplanade near tons of cute shops and restaurants.  We wished we'd stayed in this area and could hang out all day!"
Piece of paradise,"Four mile beach is a long beautiful beach that spans palm trees, beautiful sunrises and a gorgeous mountain range. The sand is quite compacted so it’s perfect for walking, running, riding a bike or just sun baking. One end has an enclosure for swimming and the rest is open. I swam in the open but was always conscious of what might be in the sea. That is, depending on who you’re talking to.  Thoroughly enjoyed the serenity."
Enjoyable and safe ,Safe for kids and patrolled with life savers if you swam between the flags. The backdrop of mountains was gorgeous and amenities to hire boogie boards and floaties. Parking was easy and not overcrowded.
Great to walk on,"This is a great beach to either go for a stroll or walk all day. No waves though, we didn't swim, water didn't look great."
"Great fun for couples, friends and families","With lifesavers on hand, the Four Mile Beach is a great place to build castles or frolic in the sea. Many also enjoy a morning walk, a great way to exercise or unwind after the hectic working lives we lead. Again if you love some yoga, a class usually runs at 8 or 9 am most mornings."
A delight. ,"We’ve been visiting Port for over 20 years and this is our 7th visit. We Like to stay at the bottom end of the beach beyond The Mirage around Solander. It’s quiet and for us the perfect location. So, a morning walk into town along this lovely beach. Generally gentle surf, coconut trees and clean white sand. Walk past the daily Yoga class and on to Macrossan Street which is patrolled by the Life Saving Club. And hence can be busy on a hot summers day. We love the town and the beach walk is a highlight for us. Have a beer at the Surf Life Saving Club in the late afternoon. Life doesn’t get much better."
Awesome beach,Lovely stretch of beach. The beach is quite wide so there is plenty of room for the kids to play on the sand.
Great place for a run and swim,Great beach we have been there for a run and swim everyday since arriving water is calm and many people ride their bikes on the sand as its compacted enough i have been running everyday with no runners and then jump in for a swim love four mile beach then having a beer or wine at the surf club.
Great walking beach,This beach is fantastic to walk on and it is beautiful and clean. If you want to lay down the sand is hard so would recommend bringing or hiring a chair. Sunrise and sunsets are beautiful and there is an easy walk to the lookout to view the beach from.
tropical paradise,This palm tree lined beach is gorgeous! It has a nice lookout (you can access from the stairs at the end) where you can get lovely photos of the entire beach. Many people were lounging and some swimming between the flags even though the water seemed cold to me.
Great long white beach,Great beach easy to walk and can be accessed at various points. Has a safe swimming area as well in certain seasons
Nice beach for a walk,"4 Miles, good walk, as with most beaches up this way the threat of stingers and crocs means swimming is a bit iffy but fantastic vista"
Pristine Beach,Walking with friends and seeing all the families just loving our beautiful coastline filled me with pride for our wonderful country.
Sunrise delight! ,"Watched the sunrise on the beach with the kids, so pleased we did, absolutely stunning. Incredible to be able to enjoy the beach in the middle of winter, seems a distant memory now I'm back in nz with the fire going ❄️😔"
Great walking beach,Not really for swimming- the very Long Beach has a small netted area up near the surf club ( although nets only out in stinger season ). Ever afternoon the winds pick up & it’s extremely choppy. Swimming in the morning the water was calmer - but visibility poor . Take a walk or ride a hire bike with the rest of the tourists!
 Beautiful beach,"This is a great beach - especially with the beautiful weather in July. Lots of room for everyone, beautiful water, lots of sun. A great break from the Melbourne winter."
Heaven on a beach,"Come early in the morning and greet the sun.The beach is flat and you will be joined by a multitude of other holiday makers and locals jogging or walking on the firm beach.Not many people swimming or surfing but if you want view, coconut trees and a place to find zen, this is the beach."
Nice long beach,Fun for a nice long walk. Not ideal for swimming but the beach is long and once you get out of the touristy part you at times have the whole of the beach to yourself.
one of the nicest beaches,nice beach with rainforest and mountains in the background. great walk up and down the PD city center.
Love this beach!!!,"Before going, I read someone say this isn't the nicest beach. I guess it depends on what you're looking for. I think this is one of the loveliest beaches I've ever seen. The best way to see it is to bike the length of it. Beautiful!!!"
"Sand, Sun, Chill","A wide and long sandy beach. If you stop and look in the shallow water you will see many small sea life, including crabs, creatures in shells of many small sizes, little fish. It;s great. Just keep an eye out for Crocs. The Lifeguards travel the beach on the lookout, and they are not often seen, but every few years one might come visit. And there are coconuts if you are really hungry."
No crocks.,Beautiful beach with patrolled swimming section closer to town where you can hire various water related equipment depending on your interests. Lovely for walking along and just enjoying the scenery. I am assured that crocks don’t like this area as it is too exposed. There are also body training stops along the streetscape for the fitness types as well as a couple of cafes at the city end.
Beautiful part of the world ,So glad we got to stay in this beautiful area of the coast! The kids enjoyed trying to crack open coconuts and playing on the beach. I enjoyed the sunrise!
Gorgeous in every way,"A must for visitors to this region of Australia, really nice sands and water with great snorkelling."
Beach walks,Lovely clean beach. Was advised to watch out for crocodiles but we stayed on the sand and tended not to go on a couple of tracks as advised by a local.
A Secluded Expanse,"Four Mile was exquisite in its expansiveness and natural beauty, and though winter weather and warning signs kept us out of the water, the sheer relaxation provided by this alluring shoreline was well worth the visit!"
"Long flat beach, good for a walk","Long wide beach with packed sand good for a walk or a run. Lot of waves and a small area to sunbathe. Lot of waves, so not for swinning."
Terrific beach to lose oneself,"I am glad to have this magical sandy haven to ourselves. We were appraised of the facts that early last century there were horses, motorcycles and foot-races on the beach, which incidentally offered a platform for Charles Kingsford Smith to land his plane on in 1932. Glad to be here, at one with nature soaking up the serenity and Crystal clear waters. The sand is course and swimming was not an option to experiment with cause of the crocks. We came back late in the afternoon atop two bikes on loan from our hotel."
Absolutely wonderful ,Such a lovely clean and beautiful beach. With a lovely  back drop of Palm and coconut trees so close to resorts.
The Beach,We stayed at the Ramada Resort which has a track through to the beach which is great for walking and/or bike riding at low tide which you may catch at varying times. Walking north we were approx 3.5 kms from the town where you could relax have a coffee and then walk back or catch the Shuttle back to your hotel. The beach is not what you could call golden sands but being palm tree lined and with a view to the mountains and easy swimming. Kite Surfing Lessons are also available.
Four Mile Beach,"The beach is close to most places and it was only a few minutes walk from the resort.Although the days were amazing sunshine, hardly any people. It's not really a beach for laying in the sun as the sand is not soft underfoot. Most people I saw were mainly walking the hard wet sand or riding a bike.View is lovely, but water is muggy and the thought of crocs worried me.Did not see any swimmers at all.I went a couple of times during a 7 night stay, but as with most people enjoyed my time more by the resort pool."
Hire a pushbike and ride the beach,"The sand is compact, flat and smooth and makes for a perfect pushbike ride. Palm tree lined and beautiful. Hire a pushbike from the hire shop in Port Douglas and ride from one end of the beach to the other.  Return along the beach or cut through one of the many tracks and return via the bike paths."
Port Douglas 4 mile beach,Lovely tropical rainforest mountain views along the beach lined by palms.  The sand is grey and like clay. Not the beautiful golden sands you would expect. The water is more often brown then blue. Very disappointing. We have been in the area a month now and yet to see the water blue between Cairns to Port Douglas like in the brochures!
Lovely stroll in am,Wind comes up in arvo- good for windsurfing .. take a stroll here anytime. Swim between flags and hire some sun lounges -
A beautiful tranquil beach.,"You can walk for miles and never be over run with visitors. The water is warm and you can swim (after May) with no stingers. its lovely and flat when tide goes out, can also ride the bike all the way. Also shady spots under the trees to chill out and have a nap."
Sand and water,"4 miles of perfection..Soft sand, clear warm water. Great swimming all year around. Lovely to walk into town"
"Nice beach for walking, wading but less so for swimming","Lovely long beach for walking and exploring in low tide.  It was recommended to not swim unless a lifeguard was on duty, which was not the case near us."
4 mile Beach,About a 40 minute to 1 hour walk one way. You can bike ride it. Lots of space for privacy and also if you want to join the crowd. No crocs sighted. Swimming was great when it was calm and flat.
A nice walk,"We stayed at the Sheraton recently and 4 mile beach is a nice stroll into Port Douglas from that resort.  The myriad of crab “sculptures” as they remove sand from their homes offers interesting patterns, but as a beach, it isn’t that great unless you are after a site for beach soccer or bike ride as it is wide and flat and hard."
Great stretch of beach,Walked the length of this beach ( both ways) almost daily during our visit. The stairs to the lookout at the northern end are not a real challenge but the view is good The southern end holds a few surprises like doobee smoking ladies and at least one topless yoga person!!Great seeing the patterns created by the crabs and fun watching the Segway riders
Beautiful flat beach,"Loved being able to run on the beach. I’ve never seen a beach so flat and the sand compact. Bikers and Segways are even able to use the beach. Nice calm water and clean. Because of crocodiles and stingers in-season, they only recommend you swim at the patrolled portion on the far end near town. Plenty of parking there and even a beach hire for chairs, SUP’s, body boards, etc. Great place to spend the day."
"Beautiful beach...warm waters, mountain back drop, coconut tree lined","We arrived at the start of winter....no stingers, yes! The beach was pristine and uncrowded. We frolicked in the small waves and walked the long lush green fringed shoreline to take in the natural beauty of the Coral Sea and the mountains in the backdrop. Gorgeous and soul refreshing! The sand is compacted and the slope of the beach is near non existent. If you lay your towel down it will suck up the water just below the sand and become a wet blanket. We learned that the first day. No wonder everyone was up under the trees where a small strip of sand was dry. I thought they just wanted the shade. Bahahaha! Lesson learned. Also, if you are looking for shells, good luck. I found one tiny eensy weensy one. It might be the time of year, but I was still surprised by the lack of them."
Lovely beach,Nice open beach....  near to Port Douglas town.   Not at all crowded and great for a relaxing walk or a lazy day relaxing and catching some sun.
Perfect,One of the most relaxing places for a walk or cycle. Just heaven. Lovely to swim in too but wish people would swim within the flags.
Great Beach,Fun & easy to walk on at low tide. Coffee shops close by. Easy access from the road. Unique scenery.
One of the best beaches in FNQ,Wander up the steps at sunrise for a cracker view. Great that they have lifeguards and a stinger net so you can swim all year round
Pristine ,A wonderful stretch of sand and water The area is monitored be SLS is small compared with the total length of the beach
Lovely beach,"Four mile beach is a lovely beach, although stinger netted areas are in force from November to end of May"
OK for a walk,"There isn't much to see here other than sand and sea the sea is restricted for swimming and the beach was busy on two of the days due to the carnival but otherwise a vast empty tropical beach, Great for a walk but  nothing special."
"Beautiful To Walk on, Not for swimming!","As its name implies, it is about 4 miles long and lovely to go walking. Unfortunately this stretch of coast is known for its ""Stingers"" (Jellyfish) that can be deadly."
Fantastuc beach for everyone,A lovely beach to walk and run and swim at . Palm trees and clean water safe with life guards and relaxing atmosphere. .
Lovely Morning Walk,Take the time to stroll along this lovely beach and enjoy the sea views. We did this in the mornings before we started our day and many times we saw cruise ships and other boats passing by.It won't be the deserted beach experience you may desire but plenty of beach for everyone. Best to ensure you also have bug spray on as sand flies are everywhere in Qld.
Beautiful sunny day or cloudy day ,Beautiful beAch no matter what the weather ! Can see mountains reaching to the sea . Often eagles flying around looking for food . Sometimes shells . Lots of palm trees . Flat sand great for walking running cycling etc .... a great walk everyday 👌👌👌👌
Nice beach walk,"We walked along the beach for about 40 minutes into town. It was a nice little stroll rather than going along the roads. Not many people there and we kept our eyes open for crocs! We were a bit disappointed in the sea and beaches, they were nothing like the pictures in the ads! However, they just don't compare to our beautiful WA beaches."
"Tropical paradise -well, nearly",A great beach just a stones throw from the town. Its safe for the family to play on and great if we you just want a walk along the sea edge which we did often. A delightful place
Lovely walk,Great beach for a walk. Gentle slope and palm fringed beach 🏖.Make sure you follow local direction depending on the time of the year in regards to crocodiles and stringers
Great Beach Walk,"Beautiful beach with great views of the Coral Sea and cruise ships sailing past. Great walk along beach in the morning, but check tide times as some high tides leave little room to stay on dry sand."
Escaping the cold,Just a fabulous escape from the cold Gippsland  with the family.. plenty to see and do in this fabulous area..
Lovely looking beach,We stayed a few minutes walk from the beach. It's clean and really beautiful. Shallow too. Watch out for stingers. There are vinegar stations scattered around the bordering parks
Great for morning and evening walks,Very long beach and best for walks .very small area is under supervision for swimming. They have nets for safety so you must swim in that.Sunrises are good.
Its a Beach,"Its interresting to stand at thee town oend and look along the beach, which stretches away into the distance. Theres a netted area for swimming right beside the lifesaving club, where they do very good coffee."
Sand flees,A half hour walk and paddle up to my calf’s resulted in hundreds of sand flee bites a massive allergic reaction with blistering all over my legs and up to my lower back accompanied by massive heat and itching- despite string steroids from the doc it still persists 6 days later - very very unpleasant- ps I had repellent on as well - avoid
"Beautiful, clean beach",This beach was just down the road from our hotel and is beautiful. It’s very clean and we just kept walking for miles without seeing too many people. There is a stinger net to section off an area in the sea to swim which is great but I guess that is the only let down that it’s not safe to swim.
4 mile ?,Its actually about 2.7 miles but who's counting .Great place for a early morning walk or evening stroll and has a surf patrolled safe swimming area
Spectacular,"Stayed at Sheraton Mirage, and walked this beach each day. Beautiful beach, and views. We cycled the beach as well .ideal."
Great Value Fantastic Morning,This is by far best value for money with tours in PD . Ant was cautious in training but it's a must to understand how these machines work and everyone learns at different levels.what a glorious morning gliding along the sand Gary
Great beach,"Excellent beach to enjoy warm weather and have a good day outdoors. Service at the beach is great. Beautiful sunset, excellent swimming without current, water is always warm, very fine sand, safe swimming behind the net"
Disppointed - maybe wrong time of the year,"The beach was dirty, had garbage all over. I donot know if we were at the wrong end of the beach. Not going there got a while."
Great for a relaxing walk,A very nice firm beach for a quick stroll. Has life guards and a safe area for swimming. Dogs are welcome and it is a very easy walk
Beautiful Views on Beach,We had a really nice walk on this beach. Did not finish 4 miles each way but got to turn.  Beautiful beach and views and a wonderful long walk with friends.
"Not the best beach ,but good for a beach walk ",Not the best beach for swimming as there are stingers but great for a 4mile walk there and back .That do have nets u can swim inside off .
Endless beautiful almost empty beach,"We walked and walked and walked along this beautiful stretch of coastline on firm sand edged with lush tropical vegetation, coconut palms and the ocean.  If you want some quiet time this is the place to go.  We passed a few walkers and several cyclists but had much of it to ourselvesThere was a safe section for swimming, manned by volunteer lifeguards, brollies and beds near the Surf Club for hire, by the time we returned around noon.Everything you could wish for and great food and drinks in the Surf Club afterwards.  Excellent value for money."
Beautiful beach,Just beautiful and unspoiled coastline. There’s a patrolled section for swimming but we also enjoyed walking along the beach. Be careful for the stingers.
So sad we couldn't swim!,"Arrived at end of stinger season, but warned still too many around to riskier. Beautiful beach anyway! Lovely place to stay for couples."
Beautiful Four Mile Beach,"We loved the four mile beach and used the swimming net to avoid the stingers, we went for long walks."
Beautiful long beach for a stroll and sand castles,"We stayed in a resort out the back of four mile beach and visited most late afternoons with our one year old to build sand castles.Great clean sandy beach. Lots of little crabs running around. Our daughter loved the freedom she had to crawl around. We did paddle at the tides edge but were very vigilant as there are crocs about, we didn't see any on the beach but did in the marina area. The water was very warm but certainly wouldn't go in too deep. There were men kite surfing in the water with stinger suits on and they didn't look too worried.Walk one way and you get to Port Douglas and the other just a load of resorts."
Very cautious segway tour,"Our family went on the Four Mile Beach segway tour with Ant.  It was great fun.  Ant had lots of chat and stories to tell about his life in Oz.  My only critique would be that it was all a bit cautious, lots of instructions about what to do and what not to do.  I can understand that from a safety point of view you have to be told lots of things but a little bit of freedom to go along the beach by ourselves would have been more fun I think.  Definitely go along, it was a fun thing to do, but expect to be hand held all the way."
Pretty- but you can’t swim due to crocs or jellyfish ,"It’s funny being at the beach but unable to swim in it. We walked this lovely beach daily to get into town in port Douglas. It’s pretty. We were warned by locals not to swim due to dangerous box jellyfish. We were also later warned not to walk or run it at high tide due to potential crocodiles. That being said, lots of ppl (with kids) on it at low tide. - Only Swim between the flags -only walk at low tide"
Enjoyable beach,"We enjoyed our time at Four Mile Beach. The sand is quite compacted as the water comes right in so might be worthwhile renting the sun loungers, however wait until after 1pm and they are half price to rent! The sunrise was beautiful just wish we had seen it in a clearer morning"
Great for a stroll - but keep out of the water,We stayed near the beach and spent many an evening going for a Beach stroll. Very noice. However the only place for swimming safety is at the (north end) netted section near Port Douglas - too risky elsewhere.
Awesome ,My husband and 16 year old daughter had an awesome afternoon on 4 mile beach on the Segway Tours. Ant was really informative of the area and being the only Segway tour allowed on the beach we felt like we had the whole beach to ourselves. A definite must if visiting the area.
Must do!,"I recently visited Port Douglas with my 12 year old son. We thought this would be a fun way to see and enjoy Four Mile beach and it certainly lived up to this expectation. I was a bit unsure of how I would go, but Ant’s down to earth training and guidance did the trick. Ant went above and beyond to ensure both of us got the most from the experience. We both agree this was one of the best things we did during our Port Douglas visit. An especially big thanks from Nik."
Stayed on 4 mile beach,Great view but beware - we were there during April and they recommend not swimming on the beach due to jellyfish and crocodiles. It’s not your typical white sand beach but still need to go visit and see.
"Great running beach, great views","Although you can’t swim at this beach due to jellyfish for most of the year, it is a classic tropical coastline great for the instagram photos. The sand is quite compact most of the time making for a great running beach. You’ll see many people walking or running and the entire place has a friendly vibe! Recommend a look if you’re in the area and an early morning run to beat the heat and humidity."
Leave your castle building tools at home!,"This is a long, wide and scenic beach. There is a section with a jelly fish net, near Port Douglas. As you would expect, this can get very crowded. You may be taking some risk at other sections of the beach but there won't be as many people there. You can try kite surfing and other activities asking the beach. There is at least one playground just off the beach. You can even ride your bike on it.However, if you are looking for a nice sandy beach, look elsewhere. The sand is coarse and firm. Our kids managed to get a few buckets of sand into something that resembled a fort,  but they only did this once as it was not worth the effort."
Beautiful beach and surroundings,Great spot for a walk but sadly cannot swim or paddle unless in the sectioned off area due to stingers and crocs.  Must have a pool where you are staying for a swim.
Lovely walk on Tropical beach,The four mile beach is a great place for a morning jog or walk.Lined with Coconut Palms it's a beautiful place for photos.Water is not safe for a swim due to jelly fish and Crocs.
Nice beach,"Nice beach, not that many waves, currently stinger season so the nets were out, was pretty windy at the beach when we visited so we choose to swim back at the resort in the pool."
Beautiful beach,"Great beach for walking, swimming. Recommend you stay within “stinger net “ area under lifeguard supervision so you are protected and safe. Also great walk up cliff path at north end. Affordable sun lounger and umbrella deal just haggle a little!"
Great beach,We stayed here for a week during Easter - 5 minute walk to beach and great for a morning run or kite surf!
"Great view, could not swim",Great looking beach.  Was unfortunately closed for swimming due to rough seas for the entire duration we were there in the first week of Apr 19
Amazing views and not crowded,Beautiful beach.  Take the footpath hike for extended views.  Bring water and snacks. Limited access to refreshments.
Great beach,"Lovely beach, safe for swimming and very clean. Lifeguards on patrol. Some nice cafes close by for a coffee after watching the sunrise."
Disappointing,"Nothing like clean golden Sydney beaches. Sand is dirty, good for walking on but no dry sand to out towel on. Water is dirty and churned up"
Breathtaking surroundings!,So calm and very relaxing to walk this beach. Undisturbed and soothing . We walked the beach every morning and afternoon to watch the sunset... amazingly beautiful andClean beach..
