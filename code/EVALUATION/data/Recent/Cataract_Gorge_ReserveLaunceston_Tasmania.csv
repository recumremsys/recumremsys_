Walk the Gorge,Walked in from The Penny Royal (over bridge and along northern path) and back Zig Zag track. Toll track very easy with just some slight rises. Good interpretation.Zig Zag track steep and high steps in places but a good experience for someone that doesn’t really walk such tracks. Great views. Tailrace interesting.
A Launceston must do,Lovely day out and very peaceful place We took the chair lift and went over the Gorge and then walked back down towards the Penny Royal and back again and the whole family had a great time.Definately a Launny must do and a great cheap day out
Pleasantly surprised,Underrated this place! We loved our visit here - the walks were great as well as the scenery - loved going on the sky rail - highly recommend
A Bit too Commercialised ,"Although this gorge is indeed beautiful, it is a bit too Commercialised for more adventurous travelers. In my opinion, this attraction is more suitable for families."
"""How amazing is Catarat Gorge"".","How amazing is Catarat Gorge in Launceston? Very, very amazing. To think this attraction is right in Launceston. We purchased the chair lift return tickets and were glad we did. Fantastic views right across the gorge and great for photographers. The gardens were beautiful and the walk over the suspension bridge is a must. The swimming pool is really good. There are piblic toilets, change rooms and bbq's onsite. Also a cafe and restaurant sitting high with beautiful scenery. Loved this adventure and thoroughly reccommend a visit while in Launceston and don't forget your camera."
A nice walk with a surprise at the end!,"We enjoyed the walk along the gorge - an easy concrete/tarmac path with fencing all the way, and information boards about the history.  We were amazed when we got to the end and found the beautiful Victorian gardens and recreation area with swimming pool.  It seemed to be a great place for families to spend a sunny afternoon."
Intersting but sloping terrain and paths.,We visited on a hot summer weekend and the reserve was pretty busy with lots taking advantage of the pools and green lawns to cool off and relax. Parking is by pay and display. As the cafe menu was unsuitable we did not use all our time. Its possible to cross the river and walk along the path to city bridge. But it was too tricky and busy for us. The paths within the reserve are steep though paved.
A great place to relax,"What an amazing place this is. We had a morning to kill before our flight back to Melbourne and chose this place. Parking is plentiful (metered) and close to the entrance. The staff, as everywhere, were friendly and helpful. The area is free to walk around and there is a delightful chairlift which costs about $12 return. There is abundant wildlife, including peacocks and wallabies. Lots of clean toilets and a great cafe with lovely cakes. We could easily have spent longer here and can thoroughly recommend it for people of all ages, including children. The walks are well-signposted."
Love this natural attraction so much. We always enjoy walking through the gorge.,"Stop at the cafe for morning tea, your sure to see a peacock or two. I love the flora, the magnificent red woods, rhododendrons, ginkos and ferns. Plenty of interesting walks. The suspension bridge is a must as is the chair lift. If your staying in Launceston walk or drive, you won't be dissapointed."
"Located just a few minutes drives from the Launceston city centre, the Cataract Gorge is truly an urban park","Located just a few minutes drives from the Launceston city centre, the Cataract Gorge is truly an urban park with all amenties you'd need. The park is well equipped with a chair lift, beautifully landscaped gardens, well maintained hiking trails, a cafe, a restaurant, toilets as well as BBQ facilities. The beautifully maintained gardens and BBQ facilities provide for ideal spots for picnics or just to lie down and enjoy the beautiful environment. The chairlift provides a beautiful elevated view of most of the park as you leisurely move from one end to the other. Ideal for the whole family."
Super beautiful!,"Very close to Launceston, you can spend hours walking there and I highly recommend to walk all the way to the old power plant. "
Easy place to visit and enjoy.,This beautiful nature reserve is in the centre of Launceston. So easy to get to and well worth a visit. give yourself about 1 hour to see the sights. A bit longer if you want to stay for lunch or go on one of the longer walks.
A few days in Launceston,"We've done the Gorge previously, however this time we walked up to the old Powerstation. What a ""blast"" from the past and it is so nice to see these historic features without the crowds. The walk is easy enough, however be prepared to take your time and let the scenery and…"
What a place - and so close to the city,"We spent both our full days in Launceston predominantly at CG. It's a fabulous place with nature, history, activities and a couple of nice restaurants. We walked all over there are heaps of trails for all levels of fitness. Fantastic display at the hydro station informing us of…"
A lovely place to roam aroand,"The gorge is well maintained, the chairlift system runs well and it allows for both long and short walks/hikes through the reserve.  There is a large amount of wildlife and the scenery can be spectacular."
Nice and relaxing,"What a day at reserve. Lift chair is too good. It’s a small ride but views are breathtaking. Swimming pool, cafes and walk on suspension bridge is unforgettable."
Wonderful experience and great exercise,We were staying in Launceston so took a lovely stroll to Cataract Gorge. A steep slope upwards but lovely views and lots of info along the way. Great gentle ride on the skylift and another casual stroll back. A must see for all visitors to the city.
Launceston Cataract Gorge,"Close to the city centre, parking available for a fee, and a spectacular ride on the chairlift across the gorge. There is a cafe on the other side with pheasants and chicks and wallabies wandering freely around. A very comfortable walk at the edge of the gorge towards the city, with other walk options available. There is a walkway to return to the carpark or get a return chairlift ride."
Beautiful spot shame about the toilets,"Beautiful reserve,   Chair lift was a great experience, staff were very friendly and even a tame wallaby.  BUT the toilets were filthy and disgusting each one clogged up with waste."
Cataract gorge,Beautiful a must visit.Allow at least 2 hours.Take water during summer Lots of information and wild life
Stunning spot ,We had an amazing time. The facilities were fantastic and the views spectacular. Very impressive and well kept
Worth a visit,"Catarsct gorge is stunning and a fantastic family-friendly day out! We had a great time hiking some of the trails, and saw some lovely wildlife! The views are fantastic, facilities are great and walking trails cater for everyone. The scenery is breathtaking, particulary from some of the hikes/lookouts There is a beautiful pool for if you are going during warmer weather, a great children's playground, and multiple places to get food. A must do while in Launceston!"
Great walking trails!,"Very picturesque reserve, with great walking trails. Highly recommend the walk up to Duck Reach museum along the river - its great!"
Must be great as a child,"If you were growing up in this neck of the woods, it must have been such fun exploring such places. Can't help but think modern kids miss out on this sort of upbringing in the more 'risk averse' European world."
Interesting ,You can either walk from the city or drive to car park near either basin. Would recommend parking near the first basin then take the cable car one way and walk back. Parking is not that expensive. Plenty of other walks you could do to other lookout points
A Must Do in Launceston!,"What a great experience - amazing structure and lovely walk.  We arrived late, so can't comment on the chairlift and seemed to be a popular walking trail for the locals."
Stunning place,"A beautiful place to visit just a short walk from the centre of Launceston. Stunning scenery, waterfall and gardens and a great place to walk in nature."
Spectacular views.,"The walk up the gorge on the left-hand side of the river provided some dramatic views of the other (very steep and rocky) side.  Returning on the right-hand side made for a good walk, though hardly as hard as the signs indicated."
Great for a family walk,"We walked to the Caract Gorge Reserve as family (7yo daughter, hubby, and myself) all the way from Kings Park. It is an easy walk, with incredible views. I highly recommend it for families with (walking) young ones (note, it is not pram-friendly). When we got there we were amazed by the views. At the end of our walk, we had brunch at the Basin cafe, which is DIVINE!!!!"
THE ABSOLUTE JEWEL of Launcestons crown,"The cataract gorge is a must do for tourists to Launceston  just minutes from the CBD the views and the amenities are brilliant.The Chairlift and top class resturaunts, the pool and surrounds are certainly worth a visit"
Very pretty,Staff were brilliant and helpful and the scenery was beautiful. Must do the chairlift and suspension bridge to get the great views
"Beautiful place, close to Launceston township","Nice place to speand a few hours.  Lust green reserve with a swimming pool, beautiful lake, lots of fauna, great walks and great views from the chairlift."
Stunning,Wow what a place to visit and a must for everyone. Beautiful place with wonderful views and lovely walks. This was one of the best places to visit for me in Tasmania
Worth it,"Saw the gorge from the water and then went in next day to see the whole gorge, only did short walks across the suspension bridge then sat at cafe for breakfast"
 For all,"This place was fantastic several different walks at various degrees of difficulty, chairlift right across the first basin, a suspension bridge 2 cafes 1 restaurants local wildlife saw plenty of birds especially peacocks and wallabies would definitely go again"
"Pop in and stay a while, lots to do or just look at the view","Very close to the  centre of Launceston, easy access, great view and activities if you are looking for something to do.Hike, swim, or chair lift and swing bridge."
Beautiful area,"Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to explore this beautiful area because we had only one evening in Launceston. We were planning to take the chair lift over the gorge, but they closed for the day just when we arrived at 5 p.m. We could only admire the place from far away.There seemed to be quite a bit of activity in the area such as swimming pools walking paths."
Amazing natural beauty ,"I visited Launceston for the weekend and just had to make a stop here! I’m always astounded that such a peaceful spot can just be over the hill from town. The walks are great, and quite easy for most people to get to some great vantage points. The idea of the chairlift is also good, mainly because as you walk under them you really forget that they are there and therefore don’t disturb the view. I find that they have found a good balance between allowing everyone to experience the natural state and adding features such as the chairlift, cafe & pool (why there is a fence around it with the gorge literally next to it is beyond me though)Hopefully I will come back, maybe ready for the big loop walk."
Always nice for a walk in fine weather,"We love going to Cataract Gorge when we visit Launceston.  The scenery, fresh air, and animals are always delightful to see.  The walk down from the top of the chairlift is easy and pretty."
nice!,Another must visit place when you are in Tasmania. Peaceful and sunny weather can be found here. Chairlift is fun too and one should try it at least once. The gorge is quite huge and might take half a day to chill and complete.
Great place in the heat.,Went both end of the gorge. Crossed the gorge using the chairlift and visited the river end by boat. Both worth doing.
Good walk topped off with a swim,Lucky enough to experience the gorge in good weather.  An easy walk alongside the gorge followed by a dip in the pool
Loved it!,A place where beauty and Australia meets together to make a placed everyone should see at least once.  Recommend it!
A sight to behold,Such a great place to relax. It has been popular attraction for more than a century and I totally understand why.There's public swimming pool for kids and adult alike. This is really great for me as I am not a big river-lake lover when it comes to swimming. An open cable car to enjoy the views better is a must.Fearful of this service... The an easy hike is all you need to reach the peak.Very well maintained greens as well. A must
Worth a look,"So pleased we went.  It was a nice, easy walk before dinner.  A couple of little hills but not too bad.  The views are lovely.   A little oasis in the city."
Worth A Visit,"So close to city of Launceston. Lovely gorge to walk through, or   take the chair lift  across to the other side and walk back an easy walk. Or further walks and sights to explore."
Great walk with beautiful view,"Great relax walk with beautiful view , if warm day ensure to bring swimming gears. There is a big beautiful swimming pool to relax in at the basin."
A sunny day walk,"We travelled to Launceston, visioribgthe Cataract Gorge area. After traversing two of the shorter walks, and reviewing the area we were so impressed with the walks, the sights, and the whole area. You can walk, swim in the pool or the force itself, have coffee or meals in the cafe, travel the chairlift and see t he sights from on high. A fabulous day out. We loved every minute."
Must do when visiting Launceston ,Visiting ‘The Gorge’ should be a priority when visiting Launceston and even more so if you are a swimmer. The water ranges from around 18C in summer to 10C in winter and there are swimmers there all year. The fresh deep water contrast with the ocean that is more commonly swum around the picturesque South Island of Australia.
A dreamy start to the day,We had an early swim at the basin (free) then caught a round trip on the chair lift ($16p adult return - $14 one way - or two for one with an Entertainment Book voucher). We them had a late breakfast in the cafe - beautiful views!The water was around 17 degreesC - warmer than some of tge ocean temperatures at present.  Swimming into the falls provides a great spa opportunity.The chair lift - with the longest single span in the world - was great. We saw an abundance ofpeacocks and peahens and many baby peacock chicks which we were told are less than a week old as well as some about a month old.  There was also a lot of very healthy and happy looking wallabys. Photo opportunities were prolific. We caught the chair lift back (we had a return ticket) and then ate a delicious breakfast at the cafe. I would recommend the ricotta and banana hot cakes.
Visit,"Absolutely lovely place, well worth visiting, be careful on the suspension bridge, I think they hire children/teens to make it rock 😁 when you are on it. The gardens are just beautiful with peacocks and ducks and other wildlife and the pool is a great place to cool down in. The cable car gives a wonderful overview of the entire place and the restaurant provides basics and quality meals."
Highlight of Launceston,"Wonderful area of Launceston. Great for walks, swimming in the warmer months, picnics, photography, and occassionally festivals and events in the wide open space."
Superb location to spend a day.,"This is a superb location and beautifully located. Full marks to all concerned for giving us this Gorge attraction. We did the circular trek around the gorge including on the return the zig zag track.  This must be the main attraction in Launceston, followed by the Tamar river cruise. But the Gorge is Free!! Excellent."
Loved the chairlift,"What a lovely place to walk, swim, picnic, bring family and friends for a day out. Close to town and a place that does not charge to park."
Afternoon visit,"We arrived at First Basin about 4:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon. There were still quite a few people around, with some swimming in the pool as well as in the gorge. The whole vista is lovely. There is a great playground for kids, which appears to be fairly new. We enjoyed a stroll over the suspension bridge. A great way to spend an hour or two.I recommend this as a must do for visitors to Launceston."
Great walking tracks,"Have been there before, but this time I did a walk through the reserve a must do. The weather was prefect great facilities"
Oasis in the heart of a city,"What an amazing place. We were lucky enough to be staying in a studio apartment overlooking the gorge, which was just a 5-10min walk down the zig zag track.An amazing local beauty located within a 15-20 minute walk into the heart of the Launceston city centre. It’s hard to think you are so close to a regional city such as Launceston!Beautifully manicured gardens, walking paths, flora and fauna, with a café on one side and a restaurant on the other! Plus there is an adventurous playground for kids, ample grassed areas to run around, an outdoor swimming pool, plus a chairlift and bridge to take in the views!When in Lonny, it is a must visit!"
not really worth spending a massive amount of time here......,"........unless using the pool/kiddies play park or eating here. best to take the 2-way ""skyway"" rather than taking the walk thru the gorge. lots of parking - buy a ticket, as wardens here are vigilant - and the attraction is reasonably priced. once you get into the main part of the gorge you are pretty sheltered from the winds that are blowing quite fiercely at the entrance area"
Lovely day out ,This is a must do if you are anywhere near Launceston. The scenery is picture perfect. There are walks to suit everybody. There is also a pool ( we dint use it) which was very popular. There is also a restaurant and good facilities. Give yourself at least half a day here and relax. Would also be ideal for a picnic!
Cataract Gorge Reserve Tasmania ,"Spectacular scenery and plenty of activities for kids. There’s a chairlift which offer great views of the area. Good walking tracks and plenty of areas for picnics. Cafes and other food outlets. Great for the whole family, friends or a solo trip."
So close to Launceston,"A credit to the council & grounds staff. Beautifully presented natural environment ,walking distance from Launceston. Plenty of walking trails for all levels. Chair lift for a special view. Plenty of paid parking. A terrific cafe with great food & magic views."
Must visit for all levels of fitness,"Visited late on a sunny afternoon, so cable lift and cafe were closed, but still a great experience. I wish that I'd brought my swimmers to enjoy the late sunshine on the lawn and free outdoor pool.I walked out on the flat path, over the cable bridge, then out to the stunning cantilevered Sentinel Lookout, back to the main area then back via the fun but strenuous Zig Zag track. All in all, a great way to spend an hour and a half - if I'd had more time I'd have carried on to Duck Rock and the Power Station. A magical place."
Cataract Gorge a delight,"Amazing nature reserve right in the CBD area. About a 10min drive from the city.The round loop walk is easy and they have a great swing bridge.  You can pay to use the chairlift, $16 adult return, and it was great fun.  Our party dud both the walk and chairlift.  There is a free swimming pool with lots of toilets and change rooms.  Bbqs ate around as well for family groups.  You need to pay for parking so make sure you check out the meters.  There is the zig zag track for those wanting something more challenging.  We also tried the coffee shop.  Standard price dor this coffe shop - around $12.50 for coffe and cake.  Menu items pretty steep."
Great for an Early Morning Walk,"I was staying in the city and decided to go up the Gorge for my early morning walk. Round trip took me 1.15 hours. At 6.30 am it is so peaceful, with a few other early morning walkers and plenty of wallabies and Peacocks. The walking track is paved all the way and follows along the side of the Gorge, around the restaurant area, over the old suspense bridge, around the park and swimming pool and back again. I would highly recommend it. Great walk, great scenery so close to the city."
Fantastic area,"This is a amazing place loads to do. I enjoyed the cable chairs which give great views of the gorge. There is a great family area and lawn area with play park toys for kids as well as a swimming pool, people also enjoying a splash in the gorge. So great walks across a suspended bridge and for the more adventures walker there is the zizag trail which again is amazing. Lots of information boards around explains the history too. Facility were great all in all a fantastic day spent here"
Amzing,"I loved this place, an amazing little GEM in the middle of Launceston, totally unexpected. Peaceful, great for young and old"
You can't miss this,"What a fabulous place to visit - we were there on a sunny day and it was glorious.  We didn't do any of the longer walks, but just the walk around the grounds, over the suspension bridge and back down the other side was enough.  I didn't do the chairlift as I am scared of heights, but it would have been a great view."
Leesa Western ,"Loved it! The lady at the chair lift was the most delightful, helpful person we have encountered in quite some time."
Lunch with the peacocks,"Imagine my disappointment on arriving at the Cataract George, and there was no access for a disabled person to get to the tearooms and the peacocks we had enjoyed morning tea with 12 years ago. Due to my disability I could not walk down to the tearooms because of the steep slope, and the distance."
Helpful staff,"I use a walking stick and we rode the chairlift, staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly, lunch in restaurant was superb, waitress lovely"
Worth a visit,"Two walkways run the length of cataract from the first basin, which is where the cafe and restaurant are, to the Kings Bridge where the South Esk runs into the Tamar. The Zig Zag track is very steep in places whereas the track on the other side of the gorge is easy to walk and still offers magnificent views. There is parking at the main entrance but if staying in Launceston it is quite easy to walk to Kings Bridge and start your walk there, negating the need to take the car. There are shorter walks once at the first basin involving a suspension bridge which wobbles quite a bit, or a much longer walk up the gorge towards the power station for the more adventurous. You can also take the chairlift (adult fare is around A$16 return) across the basin for a nice gentle ride with views."
Amazing place to visit,"What an incredible place for locals and tourists. So beautiful and so many options for walks and hikes.Great place to see wallabies and other wildlife.Nice cafe, free swimming pool and bbqs. Amazing!!"
Must see for all!,"Such a beautiful setting, which appeals to all. There are walks, a chairlift, expansive gardens and grounds, a cafe and even a pool! Absolutely beautiful and a must see for all visitors!"
Wonderful Nature Reserve,"Beautiful location close to the CBD. Lots of gorgeous peacocks wandering around with their young. We rode the scenic chair lift which was fabulous and staff were lovely. Beautiful gardens, lots of lovely walks in the grounds and there's a swimming pool for everyone."
Swim here,Theres a free swimming pool and also many brave the cool water and swim in the basin although its not recommended for safety reasonsGreat viewsWe didn’t brave the chairlift
Beautiful part of the world ,"This is such a magical surprise as part of Launceston city. It’s free, except for the parking and chair lift. You can get to both sides of the gorge via the swing bridge. There are native animals, friendly chairlift staff, cafe, facilities for swimming- showers and change rooms. The chair lift was lots of fun and a great way to see the whole space, but it’s not necessary given the bridge and multiple access points to both sides of the gorge. I can’t wait to go back."
Natural walking in the beautiful and amazing reserve,I’m glad I’ve been to this wonderful beautiful natural walk with amazing rocks and views. It’s really great experience and worthy to visit in my life. Also the meals were excellent and tasty sitting with natural animals such as beautiful peacocks and their babies..flowers are beautiful and colourful. Just a little concern about the safety issues for the mountains and rocks climbing people and young teenagers jumping into the rivers from the rocks and If the local council has some safety signs for warning that’ll be great consideration. Thanks
Stunning!,"Drove about 10 minutes from Launceston centre and was blown away by the views here. Have to say the pool is a random part of the scenery but it's a very family friendly place, somewhere to eat and a cable cart that goes across the river-  that was fun!   Good if you're looking for exercise as you can take the bridge across and easy if you don't want to over exert yourself. Saw some friendly wallabies,too!"
Love it to pieces!  First day must if you are new to launceston.,The Gorge is ever-changing and always exciting. Lovely food available whether take out or fine dining. Lots of people to meet and talk to as you wonder about this vast yet hidden expanse.
Great open space,It’s a great place to go for a morning run. Always on my to do list when I visit Launceston. Multiple walks are available and the views are stunning
"A highlight of our Launceston visit, and a good walk as well.","A quick walk from town will get you to the entrance of Cataract Gorge, and another 20 to 30 scenic minutes will let you enjoy the gorge with its magnificent views, geology and a little wildlife at the end of your walk (wallabies and peacocks roam arountd the entrance to the Cataract chairlift. Well worth the effort, with refreshments available up the Gorge. We'd also recommend the return trip on the chairlift, $16 for adults or $12 for seniors. This adds another dimension to your walk, and lets you relax before hiking back to Launceston. An easy walk, a great afternoon or morning."
Exercise needed after all the Holidaying,"We parked in the top car park walked down to cable chairs (13 oneway16 return) for ride across gorge and walked back, beautiful gardens  well set out."
Loverly trip and the chairlift was really nice,Friendly reception and nice facility. The chair lift was a fabulous experience. I am not comfortable with heights and still enjoyed it.
Exciting and wonderful,"A beautiful place in Launceston to visit - close to the city. Great for families and young children as they enjoy peacocks and native wildlife along the walk... The gorge is beautiful both in the evening and early morning. We did from Kings Bridge end and from chairlift end. Beautiful spots along the way for lovely photos. Kids enjoy capturing wildlife on camera :) Suspension bridge is great and the walk down the Rotunda/cafe is fantastic with beautiful peacocks. With the peacocks it is good to spend a little time as the male peacock fans his feathers when the female is around him. A full display of the feathers of the male peacock is a fascinating sight for the kids too. The First basin walk is very pleasant too. The chairlift experience is great. We did the walks before the chairlift and it was wonderful. A return ticket for an adult (chairlift) costs AUD 16/- Starting early in the day gives a beautiful view and about half day is needed to cover the gorge. With kids it may take longer. At the main chairlift station, there is a pool and a play area for kids with a slide and a sandpit which they enjoy. The staff at the chairlift station are very pleasant and helpful.There are steepy tracks for those adventurous too! A place worth visiting."
Fabulous,What a lovely place to visit.  We went on the chairlift and then walked back via the suspension bridge. The gorge is amazing and has a great walkway that runs above - well worth doing.  Kids will love the large swimming pool and the magnificent peacocks!
Don’t miss it.,The walks are just beautiful.  Not hard. We didn’t use the chair lift and we are not young.  Don’t miss it.
A great place to take the family or go for a walk/ hike,"We visited Cataract Gorge in January, 2020 as I had wanted to see the Alexandra Suspension Bridge. The Bridge is amazing, but there is so much more to do here. There was a pool, a great kids park, a cafe, walking/ hiking trails, lookouts and a cable car. This is an amazing place to visit as a family or even for adults looking for a nice, scenic walk.We would definitely visit here again, but next time we would give ourselves at least half a day to check out the whole place.It is great that accessibility has been considered here, with an inclinator travelling from the carpark level down to the restaurant and the pool/ park area. A great addition for wheelchair users, people with mobility issues, people with young children and people pushing a pram."
Beautiful setting,"A beautiful setting that is surprisingly close to the CBD. Loved the surrounding walks, swimming pool and kids play ground."
Cataract gorge,A wonderful place to visit. The chair lift is a must do.Friendly people and wildlife A must do is the suspension bridge walk
Beautiful Natural Attraction ,"We enjoyed our day here, it's a great mix of historical and new. the staff are all really friendly. Also good provision for motorhomes."
Something to do,"If you’re looking for something to do, this reserve provides that. It has a great a great chair lift that overviews the entire park. The wildlife is awesome to see and the bridge is a standout."
  Cataract Gorge Walk,We decided to walk the whole 10kms route taking in also Snake Gully and the old Duck Reach hydro-electric plant. On route we encountered a Tiger Snake on our path which kept us entertained for a few minutes.We walked the route anti-clockwise and did it in a comfortable 3 hours.
Very Scenic,A must visit site. Very Scenic. The chairlift is really great. The gorge is very pretty with lots of water.  I could see some peiple swimming as well. Lot of walking trails.
Beautiful gorge with lots of walking trails,"Had a relaxing afternoon walking around the gorge. So many tracks that give you pleasant views around the gorge. Didn't do the chairlift but if you're thinking of doing it, it's $16 return or $13 one way for an adult. If you're lucky you'll see some peacocks. There's also a pool. If you want to swim in the gorge it looks like you can. The suspension bridge is pretty neat too."
Having fun in the sun at the Gorge,"Have been here several times, the last time only a few days ago.  Was great to see so many people up there, swimming or just relaxing.  Wonderful tourist attraction for Launie to have"
Pleasant hours spent in an amazing parklands.,"How lucky Launceston people are to have this at the doorsteps.  Everything from rugged landscapes to sculptured parklands, wildlife, many walks, some easy some more challenging, a chairlift, swimming pool -  the list goes on!"
Hidden Gem,What a hidden gem. Great walk to the other side of the gorge. Fantastic scenery and wildlife. Heaps of peacocks. A lot of history. Would recommend a visit when you are in Launceston.
Fun afternoon out with the family,Warm day enjoyed by us all. Busy car park $6 for the day.Plenty of shady spots for picnic but a cafe there too if needed$34 for chair lift one way for family of 4. Nice walk back over suspension bridge Children had fun jumping off rocks into the water.
Wow....,"Day at Cataract Gorge was just great. What a view and scenery. We walked around the area, down to the city and back again. The kids went swimming in the river and had a good time at the river. Recommend to spend 3-4 hours at least, longer if you want to do more walking."
Must see,"We went on the hottest day, 40+, we walk there and the views were amazing, chair lift a must, gives you a overview of the place, relaxed under a shady tree then had a refreshing swim in the gorge. Scenery was awesome"
Nice to hike ,Loved the hike here. Lovely place to spend a couple of hours at this pretty place. You can see wallabies and rabbits here.
Tassie,"Really nice little spot. We went for brekky, and then did the chairlift and walked back along the bridge and look out. Lovely morning out. 👍"
Need a couple of hours,"Make sure you take the chairlift one way and walk back over the suspension bridge, walk along the easy track back towards town and look for the seal. Have some coffee and vanilla slice at one of the coffee shops with the beautiful view of the gorge. Lovely gardens with peacocks to look at make for a very relaxing time. Have a swim in the pool or just relax watching everyone else. Good for a couple of hours."
Breath taking!!,"Gorgeous natural surroundings so near to the town. Lovely relaxing walk with a swim under the bridge and waterfall. Picnic, sunshine- gorgeous"
Breathtaking! ,"Beautiful, great for family, lovely walk. A must go for family with kids!! We also did the chairlift that was the highlight of our trip there. My kids can’t stop talking about the whole experience."
Best of Launceston,"Fabulous walk along the gorge starting from Trevallyn Street. End up at the Cataract Gorge Reserve, where you can take a dip in the water, swim in a pool, ride the cable car, have a picnic (free bbq's), play in the playground, walk other trails, go over the suspension bridge and more.You may be lucky and see the resident seal in the gorge waters."
Great outdoor activity,"This was the perfect activity after a long road trip to Launceston. We rode the lift one way and walked back across the wooden bridge. Easy walk. Wallabies and pademelons and peacocks to see at the end of the lift. The gorge itself was one of the more idyllic and impressive ones we’ve seen. Recommended, especially with kids."
Great walk,"Particularly enjoyed the walk along the riverside - beautiful area - unfortunately just too late to take the cable car across, but looked like fun.  It was a very hot day - lady at kiosk kindly allowed to buy water even though she was closing up.  Thank-you"
Cataract Gorge,Beautiful spot in the heart of a city. Fantastic that this is basically a free place to visit (chair lift excluded). Choice to swim in a pool or the gorge is excellent. View from the chair lift is amazing. Great place to spend a day relaxing.
Good for a nice walk,"This is a lovely park area, with very nice paved trails.  We did a short walk up along the gorge and it was an easy walk.  Did not have time to do the chair lift."
A great day outing spot,"This amazing place is just 5 mins drive from the town. It has everything what it takes for a day out with family and friends. Short and long walks, wallabies and peacock spotting, a chairlift, swimming pools, open water swimming, bridges, small waterfalls, rock jumps into water, lot is picnic tables and bbqs."

Great workout very close to nature,"Enjoyed a beautiful afternoon walking the steep tracks of Cataract. It is't for the faint hearted, but feeling so proud of myself that I didn't give up. It is very tiring and steep, so if you can not continue do not push yourself. But with persistence, will power, support, encouragement and love from my beloved partner I accomplished it! Especially only 9 months postkidney transplant, so very proud of my achievement. Great workout for those who want to get their heart racing! Also has a great area for bbq, picnic, for kids to play, swimming pool and if you dare, you can swim in gorges water."
Day trip,Great walking tour close to the city centre. Amazing feature with water views from the walking trail.
Stunning,"The chairlift is perfect for all the family big or small, and the views were breathtaking, their outdoor pool was gigantic and is perfect for the hot days overall we loved it"
Cataract Gorge - beautiful views,"Has many levels of walks through and around the Gorge. Took the chairlift up to the top, then walked both side of the Gorge. The pool / picnic area was beautiful and a lot of families were visiting on this day. We parked in the car park and didn’t mind paying $6 for an all day park."
A gorgeous place to visit,"We love this special place of Launceston. So many things to do ranging from the pool, the gorge, chairlift & watching the residents peacock & wallabies. The kids love it!"
The perfect place for a summer swim,"There is a lake in the gorge where you can swim, or a pool if you’re feeling less adventurous. Free entry to the pool is a bonus. Beautiful views and a nice walk - best place we went in Lonnie!"
What a beautiful place.,"We visited New Years Day. Lots of people there enjoying a perfect day. We walked up to the old power station to escape some of the crowds and it was beautiful. The walk is well maintained and has a few stairs. Take a drink and allow 2 hours, we went at an easy pace. Had a good look around at the power house. Wear good walking shoes and stop at the lookout half way along for great views. We had a drink at the cafe/rotunda  when we got back. Large crowds as a PH. Took the cable car back over to the main cafe/carpark. Food place was too busy so we left after waiting half an hour for some wedges and went into town to Rupert and Hound Cafe and were glad we did. 5 star rest/cafe."
Nice short walking track,"You can go from the chairlift exit directly on a pathway nearby the gorge to the bridge and on the other side take the zik zak track back to the Bassin . You See the gorge with Great rocks, climber and swimmer . Many peacocks are in this area ."
Nice thing to do in Launceston ,"This place is a good compromise between farniente and walk. You have both activities at the same place. You can spend all day lying down on the grass, or swim in the lake or the pool or have a walk ( 2 hours or shorter). There is a play ground area for kids of all age,  there is…"
Easily accessible family fun,"Great place to visit. Easily accessible from the town with great and cheap parking. Lots of easy walks which we did with our 3 year old,  it also much longer, harder walks for older families or individuals. Plenty of activities with nice restaurant and cafe. Really enjoyable…"
Nice walk with swimming pool and a chair lift,"Good environment for hiking and other leisure activities, you can see wild wallabies and peacock if you are lucky.  There is a big swimming pool and grassland for relax which is nice."
"Cataract Gorge Reserve, Launceston.","A lovely day out! We tried to catch the free bus from town but it doesn’t run in November so we walked. It is quite a walk but is doable. Kings Bridge, wide walkways, a suspension bridge,chairlift, swimming pool, BBQ’s, restaurants which had a good range of casual and more…"
Unforgettable & enjoyable !!,"Very nice walk trough beautiful scenery  river ,cataracts ,rocks views, suspension bridge , a lot of animals like majestic peacocks ,wallabies & great vegetation . Strongly recommended"
Awesome Place to visit!,"Everyone is catered for here! There is an olympic sized pool, a kids pool, many walking tracks ,2 cafes BBQ and picnic areas a chairlift and more. The entire area is well maintained and clean"
Favourite Launnie spot,"Every time we head to Tassie to visit family in Launceston we always get to the Cataract George. For either a walk around to kings Bridge or have a crack at the zig zag Track. Or if in summer we hit the pool or the Gorge up for a swim . Plenty to look around here . Couple of restaurants, chair lift and walking tracks. A must do and see in Launceston."
Beautiful! Must visit,"A very very beautiful place!! The chairlift has a great view and was thoroughly enjoyable. The place is also wheelchair accessible which made it really great for my father to come along. A short walk to the suspension bridge from the entrance and it offered great views as well. Children can swim in the summer, looked so fun. Spotted wild kangaroos and peacocks here as well (a bonus)! Must visit in Launceston!!"
"Fun little walk, bring your swimming suit","Beautiful place with a choice of different hikes. You can choose to swim at the pool or in the lake, it’s beautiful."
Amazingly cheap. Chair lift a gimmick rip off. Easy walk in same time as chair lift circuit,Cheap. DO NOT PAY for chairlift as quicker to walk and you see more. Suspension bridge view an easy walk. Public swimming pool amazing. Circuit walk under chair lift to suspension bridge is so easy. Views amazing. Ample parking in busy times. Only pay ahead for what you need. 1 hr $2 approx gives ample time to walk circuit
A delightful oasis,"Silly us. We misread directions to the Gorge. Driving a car up over the steep hill to the First Basin car park is a whole lot easier than walking. However, the manicured lawns and gardens were a restful place to recuperate, buy a coffee and eat lunch.  On my second walking visit for the day, I discovered the easy way via the gorge with nary a hill.  The paved walkway which hangs miraculously from the huge boulders lining the gorge commences at Kings Bridge where the South Esk River flows into the Tamar.There are some interesting walks around the basin and along and above the gorge.  Sturdy hiking boots are a must should the track to the Cataract Lookout be attempted.  Not for the faint-hearted.  But the view down the gorge to the city is superb."
No visit to Launceston is complete without a walk in the gorge!,A lovely scenic gorge to complete any visit to Launceston. Excellent quality walking trails with a beautiful view up and down both directions of the gorge. The walks can be anywhere from 30 mins to several hours.
Family holiday must,Swimming pool and cable bridge walk as well as bush walking tracks. We saw wallabies in the bushes and enjoyed the well maintained and accessible park. Highly recommended!
Beautiful flowers everywhere,"The day we visited it was raining lightly, but we were still able to access the gardens and cafe via the chairlift across the Gorge.Lovely displays of flowers and even peacocks around the gardens as well as some impressive huge ancient trees."
Beautiful scenery ,Worth to visit esp open on Xmas Day where most places were closed.  Good to spend a half day there ....
Lovely Christmas night visit,"It’s always good to visit the Gorge when in Lonny. Especially on a warm night. There is a swimming pool, walking tracks, a chairlift and a cafe."
Nice visit.... Try the chairlift ,Had a nice visit. Didn't swim in the pool or the gorge but the chairlift was fun. We didn't walk back but did the return. Got some great pics.
A Hidden Surprise - A Must Visit,"The locals know about this place but it is not very well known by tourists which is such a shame as it is very accessible, easy 15 minutes drive from CBD and features a multi level waterfall gorge, a wide spanning walking bridge, chair lifts to ride over the water, a modern large public swimming pool with huge grassy surrounds and a good restaurant. This is well worth a visit."
Fun and beauty,"This place is a ‘must see’ when visiting  Launceston. It’s so easy to access and the scenery is absolutely stunning. The chairlift was a fun activity for our 7 year old sun, as was enjoying the cliff side walks.Well worth a visit!"
Beautiful,What a beautiful place to visit! The trip on the chairlift was fabulous and the walks spectacular. Well worth it!
Good day,"Lovely day for a walk around the park. Excellent scenery. Plenty of peacocks including babies. Please tourists, let them roam the area freely without harassment... it's THEIR home, not yours...!!"
Beautiful location,"This is a hidden treasure just minutes from the CBD, beautiful gardens and fantastic views.  Well worth the visit."
Good ,Nice place to visit. Great place to spend an afternoon and go for a swim. The walks around the area are pretty good to.
Great place with views,"Amazing location right at heart of city. Swimming, walking, hiking and many more things to do. Chairlift is a nice experience but not worth the money."
Great place to visit,Great place to relax and unwind. Definitely DO the chair lift. Great for photos. Heaps of peacocks to take photos of too. The restaurant in the gardens is in a lovely setting (although the staff were less than friendly on the day we were there). But the environment more than makes up for that. Worth a visit.
Excellent place to visit,Stunning place to visit. Loved the walks and scenery. Suspension bridge was amazing. Peacocks beautiful
Cataract gorge,Amazing what a treasure Launceston can be really proud of. The swimming pool and the park are free entry. Just be aware there is no pool supervision so be prepared to provide your own.
Family friendly attraction,"Walk over the suspension bridge, go for a stroll around the Basin, ride on the Chairlift, swim in the pool or the Basin or simply check out the wildlife - plenty of activities for all the family."
Great Spot within Launceston,"So close to centre of Launceston. Best place to take the family/yourself to run off/swim off excess energy. Short & long walking tracks, suspension bridge, swimming pool, natural water hole, playground, cafe, grassed area, picnic & BBQ spot. Pay $ for chairlift. Loved it, beautiful grounds, friendly & knowledgeable staff. Would go regularly if I lived in Launceston 😊"
Relaxing Place,"There is so much to do here. Firstly you do have to pay for parking. $1 per hour. They have a cafe at each side of the gorge. We decided to walk which is very easy and only about 10 mins. You can also use the chairlift for a different experience. Lots of grass, a children’s play area, swimming pool, lake, swing bridge, gardens and many beautiful peacocks."
“Peace and Tranquility”,"Fantastic place to pass the time away, saw the peacocks and other bird life in the reserve. Great coffee in the restaurant and macaroons. You will not be disappointed. We walked all over the reserve up to the power station, you need sturdy and comfortable shoes."
Great views!,Definitely enjoyed visiting this place and seeing the animals! Great views if you go on the walking trail.
Beautiful And Peaceful Walk,We arrived late afternoon and chose to ride the chairlift to the other side. It was a unique experience and very peaceful. We got to the other side and were met with some wallabies and peacocks. We walked all the way around over the bridge and back to the start again. Lovely walk over an hour stopping for photos. I would suggest that there needs to be better signs. Got lost a few times. A map is supplied but some simple sign posts would have been better. Although this did not hamper the experience. A couple of brave swimmers in the gorge too. The pool is a nice addition. What a lovely and peaceful place. Well worth the visit.
A lovely walk,Spent a couple of hours here getting away from it all. Did the full walk up to the power station. Only for the fit and with decent shoes on. It’s a very unspoilt part of Launceston. Didn’t bother with the expensive chairlift ride. It was a treat to see peacocks and they were very keen to show off their plumage!
Magical spot,Plenty of parking and great signage throughout the reserve. We traveled across using the chair lift which was a great way to see the majesty of the gorge. All of the staff were very helpful and there was much to see and do. Peacocks and wallabies were wandering around everywhere.
Superb,What a lovely surprise we had being taken here by our guests It was wonderful!!Would certainly come back and spend more time here on a future visit to Launceston
Gorge ous,"Cataract Gorge is a must see when in Launceston. Beautiful scenery, especially from the chair lift. Great walk if afraid of heights, Peacocks and Peahens roam freely/"
Cataract Gorge Walk,My girlfriend and I did the Cataract Gorge walk with my parents and other fellow relatives. It was an extremely beautiful walk and wasn’t hard at all. Certainly recommend it to anyone keen to get amongst nature whilst being in the city. A++
Natural park very near to the city,This beautiful natural park is very close to Launceston but it is also free of charge for locals but also for tourists.This is a good thing because everyone can profit of this very beautiful park.
Beautiful park,"Had a great time. Such beauty, rhododendrons were in flower. Walked halfway and took chairlift back. What a hidden gem."
Mother Nature at its best,Went here last weekend and it was excellent. Never seen so many peacocks in my life. The gorge would be great to see running although the old suspension bridge would be interesting .well worth it and close to city
A must see,A lovely place to explore either by water or along the gorge walkway . You can savour the history and the rocky features with appreciation of the physical hurdles overcome by the bridge builders in the past ( and the toll collectors)
Beautiful place to visit,What a beautiful place for a stroll and a snack! The basin is so beautiful see the peacocks and wallabies and let the kids have a play on the playground or have a swim in the pool ! Also they have a fantastic chairlift to enjoy the views! Great family spot in Launceston!
It's a gorge,It's pretty much the main attraction of Launceston. It's ok I guess.You've seen one gorge you've seen them all.
Wonderful area,"I visit the gorge each time I visit Launceston. A wonderful area with great scenery, trees, birds, wallabies and water. A fabulously walk."
Great walk,Bring comfortable shoes and ensure you put aside 45 minutes at least.  Not too strenuous unless you take the zig zag walk back.
Very accessible system of easy/ moderate trails.,"The Cataract Gorge is a must see for visitors to the Launceston area of Tasmania. A 10 minute drive from the city, the Gorge was well facilitated with trails and bridges a century ago, and has been consistently maintained and updated (there is even a beautiful large outdoor swimming pool!). The site itself is impressive, and there are several trails, some more strenuous. There is a vintage chairlift and easy access for seniors, and a cafe with full facilities for families. The best part is experiencing the natural setting, hearing the birds and admiring the gardens, perhaps seeing animals grazing in the brush."
Beautiful! Worth a visit!,"Had a fab day out hereIt’s not a massive place, easily walkable. Some trails are steeper than others.Gorgeous views.The chair lift is $16 for a return, it’s a short journey but worth it for the viewsWe saw lots of peacocks and baby kangaroos about Cafe on site nice for a chill Definitely recommend a visit here!"
Beautiful place with lots of walks,"This place is very close to the city and is soo very beautiful. Chairlift is a must do. We did it one way so we could walk the return. Breathtaking views, peacocks dancing around, pretty walks. Must visit place in Launceston"
Revisit the Gorge,I went there with my friends back in 1972.  It was so special to revisit the gorge with them.  It was beautifully kept and peaceful.
A Must,"We walked up the gorge several times during our stay in Launceston. Spectacular scenery and a beautiful “old English” feel. There is a restaurant for lunch or dinner but there is also a kiosk for coffees and light meals. Beautiful gardens with huge old trees, Rhododendrons and others that you would see in English parks. Not all exotic plantings though. Plaques show the native species and their uses by indigenous inhabitants. No visitor to Launceston should miss a visit to the gorge."
This is a must see in Launceston,A beautiful oasis in the heart of the city.  You can walk in and enjoy the scenery.  This place is so unique!
It was ok,"The circuit around the gorge was not difficult, but did involve lot of small hills. There is a more strenuous zig zag hike that can be done in the other side of the gorge for the intrepid. The gorge itself was nice enough, though fell short of spectacular or memorable. Walking distance from the city center so would recommend walking not driving."
Stunning feature in the city,"A boardwalk that starts at the Kings Bridge leads you into the fascinating gorge where you can also find walks to lookouts, peafowl and wallabies, a very good restaurant on one side of the lake and an equally good cafe on the other side and an outdoor swimming pool. An enjoyable way to spend a day for the whole family."
The Gorge,The Gorge is in a close distance from Launceston. You can walk (about 20 minutes) from the city centre to the Gorge via Zigzag track. At the main entrance where the main carpark is located you can find other tracks From easy to moderate hard level. You can also take the Gorge chair lift and travel across the river to top of the hill. From there you can walk over the Alexandria suspend bridge back to the base. You can spend your whole day there if you want. There are cafes and restaurants as well as barbecue facilities.
Nature amongst city,"A must see and a way to immerse yourself in nature within Launceston city. Great choice of walks and information about the flora. Time was limited so only explored the basin are.  Great little playground, picnic and BBQ facilities for families.  The chairlift is a lovely way to view this natural beauty."
A good walk,"The purpose of our visit was to walk. For regular walkers the guide timings are very generous. We walked the gorge and took in the scenery en route. A very pleasant walk, with historical notices. Once we got to the upper bridge and interesting old power station we climbed the steps and took the nature reserve loop back on seeing two runners, but many birds, animals and lizards. The whole walk was about 90 minutes."
Beautiful and with  amenities ,"There is a free swimming pool, but you can also swim in the gorge. There are free nice bathrooms, with changing tables, and wheelchair accessibility. There are even showers. There are lockers for rent. The scenic chair life is cheap, and fun to get a nice view. The operator had it stop for us as my friend has limited mobility. Many of the paths are doable with jogging prams/strollers. There are several easy walks, and several real hikes for more adventurous hikers. Parking lot (car park) outside the park for hourly fee or daily max of $6. Entrance to the pool and gorge are FREE."
Dont swing on the swing bridge,"The area is well maintained and amenities are great.  We loved the walk, but of course my husband had to jump up and down on the swing bridge just to get a reaction.  It really is a must see when in Launceston.   It's hard to believe something so beautiful is so close to the city."
"The ♿️Lift we were told did not open until 9am, despite gates and Cafe being open-the Council cleaner making 2-3 trips🧼","The breakfast @ Basin Cafe was good, Margaret  @Information before catching chairlift was helpful and lovely, as were all the jovial Chairlift staff. It is just common sense to have all facilities operational when the Cataract George Reserve is open to assist visitors whatever their mobility to fully enjoy their time there."
Such a gem so close to city,"We spent our afternoon here driving to the First Basin car park and took a one-way chair lift up and walking around the face cliff and the footbridge. It was so peaceful, fresh air and quiet by means no group tourists. Launceston is so lucky to have such a beautiful reserve so close to the city.We also treated by the peacocks on the ground, a couple of them open their feathers and do the dance trying to attract the females.. such a treat!!Absolutely recommended and a must-visit when you are in Launceston."
Wilderness 5 minutes from a city.,"An amazing backdrop of sheer cliffs waterways and Tasmanian lifestyle come together at the Gorge and it is so close to the city.Tasmania's longest river, trout fishing, bird life and many other wildlife groups are happy here, great walks and very peaceful."
Maybe wrong time to visit as water in gorge was quite dry up.,"Just have a quick walk around till the suspension bridge. Not as beautiful as photos seen in the net but I guess it's wrong timing as the water in the gorge was quite dry. Nevertheless, a nice walk around."
So close,This is a splash of wilderness basically in the township. You are able to walk as little or as much as you want and if you had some local parking knowledge you could walk this beautiful gorge for free.
Nature at its best,Beautiful views with many photo opportunities .Easy to walk around the place .Wonderful location for a good workout. Fresh air and is free except for the parking.
Spectacular views,A beautiful place to visit loved the lye birds in their natural surroundings. Enjoyed the chair lift which gave a great overview
Great for a walk and views,Parked at the Cliff car park then walked the zig zag track then back up the easier gorge track. Nice walk and great views. The zig zag track is steep and has steps made of big rocks so it’s not exactly easy. If you want an easier walk stick to the paved gorge track. A must while in Launceston.
A great place near the city heart,"I am a resident of Launceston and this is a special place that I love to walk or run in every week at least once.To find a nature walk like this so close to the city is very rare indeed. Great for just walking with a six or seven km loop up through Duck Reach (historic power station with a historic interpretation), or a shorter walk into the first basin where there is a chairlift and coffee shop, children’s playground, toilets and shower facilities available. Peacocks and other wildlife are also to be seen wandering freely In the landscape. Definitely, our jewel in the crown"
Walking to Cataract Gorge,The most scenic part of Tasmania that I visited. There’s a hard walk and an easy walk. I did the easy walk up and the hard walk back. Anyone could do the easy walk. The hard walk wasn’t as hard as I thought it would.
What a view!,"Just a quick drive outside of Launceston this scenic spot is well worth the trip! Wonder at the suspension bridge and take a ride on the cable car, fun for everyone!"
The staff at cataract gorge are fabulous ..so supportive of a person with limited mobility  in a potable wheelchair,I had emailed prior to arrival as I was bringing my elderly father with limited mobility We were able to view the gorge from the chair lift as the staff graciously stopped it to allow my 87 year old Father time to transition from the wheelchair and onto the chair lift seat.The lady at the kiosk was also very helpful as she provided easy access to the lift and reassured us that she would keep the wheelchair until we returned .She also showed us where the inclinator was to get back up to the carpark and our waiting coach which saved us from walking up the steep hillWe had a very enjoyable afternoon that was stress free thanks to their support and cannot thank them enough for all the help received
"Such a gem, right in the middle of the city","Spent half a day exploring this amazing place and loved it.  Quick trip on the chairlift, walked up along the river to the Duck Reach Power Station and return, quick drink at the kiosk - and loved every minute of it.Such a wonderful place to visit, right in the middle of Launie.Very special."
Easy walk about,"This walk from kings bridge into cataract gorge has been done a number of times. Easy walk with only cpl spots of slight incline. You can drive up to the centre part where there is picnic areas and cafe. There is peacocks, Roos wandering about adding to the atmosphere. A chair lift Across the gorge, suspension bridge plus other hiking tracks available. There is a swimming pool and Children’s okay areas. Great for families"
Lovely Early Evening Walk,Fortunate to visit at the end of a glorious day. A great asset to Launceston and one that's well used by locals. Fabulous walks and great vies. Must Do if in Launceston.
"Gentle walk, beautiful views","We did this walk following the Cataract Gorge river cruise. It is a gentle gradient beside the river Tamar with great views across the gorge, and various info boards en route. At the end is what one local described as ""the best restaurant in Launceston."" We chose to eat at a small Cafe next door which offered a small selection of  toasties, pies and sweet treats.There is another cafe I understand across the other side of the gorge 5 minutes walk away. Also a chairlift across the gorge. Worth exploring either on foot, or driving to the car park near to the restaurant.The walk is approximately 45 minutes gentle stroll from the car park by Tamar River Cruises. Child and stroller friendly but might be hard going with a wheelchair.Note that this describes the gentle walk on the right hand side as you head upstream into the gorge. There is a more demanding walk on the other bank.Recommend this as a very pleasant fine weather outing close to the city. There are also a variety of eating places close to the gorge entry in the city."
Wow,A must see attraction this is one beautiful place and a must see for the kids and parents alike peacocks and wallaby’s love to be photographed
Stunning Scenery,"Such a stunning area so close to the town of Launceston with so many activities available.  We were fortunate with good weather so walked to the park then took the chair lift in one direction before walking back along the river to take our time and admire the scenery.  There is a swimming pool & showers (seasonal), café, info centre or you can choose to see the Gorge from a river boat."
An Amazing Spot So Close To The Centre Of Town.,"There is a good selection of walks to do throughout the gorge as well as plenty of spots to relax and take in the awesome scenery, along with a number of peacocks roaming around."
Exploring,"A beautiful walk with both steep grade and easy grade hills. Beautiful views both sides the entire way, and nice cafe to relax and enjoy a good meal at along the way. We followed the Zig zag track through to the first basin then the Duck reach Power station track and came home via the Snake track through to the Cataract Gorge Restaurant then past the old caretakers cottage. Total time taken was around 4 hours and we were only walking at a comfortable pace and stopping frequently to take photos. The history and care taken to record and share all the details around the power station and the caretakers cottage were incredible definitely a worthwhile trek if your a history buff or a nature lover or just an avid hiker. Highly recommend!"
Awesome attraction for visitors,"Cataract Gorge reserve offers awesome views of the gorge, some walking opportunities, chair lift experience with great views, and a cafe. Overall, a 'must visit' place while in Launceston."
Worth a visit,Very pretty snd a hidden surprise in the heart or Launceston. We chair lifted in and out as were a little time poor. Spent 2 hours but if you were a keen walker or just wanted to chill you could easily double that
Beautiful Park and Gorge,Beautiful views of the gorge from the chair lift and the Alexandria suspension bridge. Many peacocks and wallabies wandering around the park (we were there in the evening). Lovely park!
‘Gorge-ous  (excuse the pun),"This is a must when visiting Launceston- chair lift across the gorge and grounds is a delightful and scenic ride for young and old.  Do as little or as much as you like- walk the scenic tracks, swim in the gorge or just sit back at the cafe and ‘gorge’ yourself on the tasty cuisine whilst surrounded by friendly and colourful peacocks .  Alternatively, take a picnic lunch and enjoy a shady spot in the glorious surrounds.  A wonderful, relaxing day out."
Lovely scenery,Lovely scenic location. A number of walks around the reserve through the forest and beside the gorge. One or two are quite difficult but most are nice and cruisey.
Fun for light hiking and spending time out doors ,"Just a bus ride from our hotel and a few blocks walk to this beautiful reserve. Nice trails, cable car rides for a fee, snack shop if you are hungry or thirsty. Peacocks and wallaby roam the area and are fun to watch. Worth an hour or two of your time to visit."
So pretty,"Cataract gorge was such a beautiful place. It had a BBQ spot so we could cook our lunch, had a swimming pool that they open in the summer and a beautiful rocky lake you can swim in. We went for a walk up the gorge and see some amazing views. We went on the chair lift across the lake to the other side of the site and it was so beautiful seeing everything so high up."
Something out of a movie! ,"What a beautiful location. Unfortunately due to having a toddler with us we couldn't do all the walks we would have liked to, although there were still tracks to walk with a stroller and a toddler."
Simply stunning,"Simply stunning at any time of the year. Peaceful and relaxing, but for those more fitness minded there are some very good walks around the area.A beautiful restaurant in the gardens to enjoy a meal.  A bit of a walk down some stairs or up some windy paths to get to it though."
Simply stunning,"Lovely walks, some a little challenging if you’re looking for that - every turn gives you another amazing view. Spectacular."
Beautiful place to visit,"Live the gorge and the location, so close to The town center.  The restaurant offers meals of all kinds,  limited choices but delightful location and setting."
Never leave Launceston without visiting this gem,"This place is amazing with lots of nature, bird and wallabies.  Simply can spent 4 - 5 hours walking around.  The chair lift is something that we don't want to go for as there is no safety belt.  We had 3 peacocks dancing attracting the pehans.  It was breathtaking."
Heavenly!,Must go on the chairlift! this place is a dream with peacocks roaming around! Breathtaking gorge! Great for a family picnic
Loved the chair lift,"Its a nice walk around here the gardens are lovely as was the chair lift, did my feet a world of good"
Jess,"What a gem of a place! I'm not great with heights but did the cable car ride one way, which was fun and walk back across the suspension bridge. Recommend!"
"Chairlift, wallabies and peacocks",A great afternoon taking the chairlift across the gorge with an easy walk back across the suspension bridge.  There are lots of available walks on well maintained paths.  Lots of wallabies in the area with many peacocks strutting their stuff.  Plenty of open areas for picnics and a play area for the kids.
Don’t miss this! ,"Lovely spot, very pretty and great gardens. Nice walks. Chair lift is enjoyable but very unsuitable for young children. For safety there should be an minimum age/size, we didn’t realise how unsafe it was until it was too late so had the most stressful trip across imaginable and did not use the return trip. Cafe is great, obliging staff and nice food. Highly recommended"
Casual stroll with an icecream,"Went here as we arrived in Launceston. Not too far so walked from our hotel and strolled the easier route through the gorge to the cafe and stopped for a snack [icecream for me!]. Pretty gorge with easy paths to navigate, suitable for all walking abilities and ages."
Hard to believe it’s so close to the city,"We walked from The Royal Park/Seaport area after reading a suggestion online. My husband and I, along with my 16month old son in the ergo carrier, walked the zig zag track up to the gorge. Definitely glad we did, as it made for a nice couple of hours walking up and back. The gorge is beautiful and hard to believe it’s so close to the city. It reminded me of Pacific Northwest Of America. We walked across the suspension bridge, and then let our son stretch his legs and have a play in the awesome play area before heading back via the way we came. Definitely worth the time and effort"
Must do this,A fantastic flat walk with great views. Restaurant at the end (2k) and you can go much further if you want
Beautiful place,"We enjoyed a beautiful sunny morning here. The chairlift was fun and the views were great. We walked back on the suspension bridge and found the rock formations excellent. Peacocks and Pademelons roam the grounds, there is a great park for the kids also. We had morning tea in the cafe and staff were lovely."
Great place for families.,"This is a great place to take the kids. The gorge is very pretty. There is a fun suspension bridge (watch out! It wobbles!), and there are beautiful peacocks wandering around the grounds, a reasonably good café/kiosk, and a very cool playground. There is also a swimming pool but that's something best left to a warm summer day. If you are a bit more adventurous, take the chairlift across the basin. You can walk there very easily from the bridge over the river near the Penny Royal (also worth checking out for families - awesome climbing wall!)"
Stunning location ,Truly worth a visit in Launceston. Peacocks. Cafe. Restaurant.  Chairlift. Walks. Swimming pool. Picnic areas.
Like stepping into another world,Visited on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. A perfect place for a stroll. Don’t miss the peacocks. The chairlift is nice but not necessary to see everything.
Beautiful and serene,A nice and serene place to hang out. All the greenery was such a pleasant sight and was very calming & relaxing.
Excellent hike and viewing,"Fantastic hike to the first basin and did the Zig Zag track back down. Very nice viewing platforms and old bridge. Didn't do the chairlift across as we had limited time, looked a good thing to do. Couple of resident Peacocks entertained whilst there."
Stunning and close,This is the second time I have visited the Gorge. My friend hadn't been there so I took her there to see the Gorge. This time I was able to do the longer walks (as I was child free this time). Very clean and pretty place to visit. The walks are great and the views are stunning.
A surprise so close to CBD,"This is a very beautiful natural place for a picnic or lunch is the there. We did have difficulty finding it with the address on the website. However after driving around a bit and using our common sense we enjoyed a quiet couple of hours with other tourists and the wildlife. Blue wrens and peacocks were quite prevalent. Be mindful, unless you park near the beginning of the chairlift, there are many steps to climb up and down in order to get to this beautiful park."
beautifil place,another beautiful part of Tasmania with lots of wildlife and a chairlift ride over the gorge. beautifull scenery
Right in the centre of town,"Was a lovely place to explore.  We spent a good few hours walking around, going on the chair lift etc.  We parked our car at Penny Royal and walked the scenic path along the gorge.  Highly recommend."
Beautiful day out,"We have visited the Cataract Gorge on a few occasions and it has always been delightful. The upgrade of the playground is excellent and the grounds are always well kept. The roaming peacocks are always curious and friendly but will be quick to steal your food if you're not careful.The trip to the Duck Reach power station is definitely a must, we drove up the hill to the power station and it was easy to find. The projection of the history of the power station was fascinating to watch. I recommend visiting this if you are going to visit the Gorge. There is a suspension bridge to cross the gorge at the power station and steps to walk down on to the rocks in the Gorge.The cafe and kiosk is well priced which makes this day trip an affordable option for everyone."
Family visit,"We loved Cataract Gorge such a beautiful site, even though the weather wasn't great, litte bit of rain & cold. The only disappointment was the cafe, staff very slow to take orders and didn't appear happy to be there."
Choose the best track for you,"We approached the Gorge from the street parking 200m downhill and first saw the track which was steep. Definitely for mountain goats! Our creaky knees thanked us for choosing the level path across the river. If you find nature worth photographing, take your camera. And if you want to admire every stone and fern, allow at least 1.5 - 2hrs. Could have done it in an hour, but would have missed a lot. A lovely setting for a relaxed stroll. We visited in dry weather."
How’s the serenity?!?!,The Cataract Gorge was just lovely. It was a beautiful walk along the path with lots of walkers/joggers keeping fit. The scenery was relaxing and awe inspiring. Thinking about the Gorge in flood and seeing the historical pictures along the way made it a great experience.
Cataract Gorge Power Station,Walked to Power Station. Some steep hills but great scenery. Tired the kids out which is always a good thing.
Great to get there via the zig zag walk,We went via the zig zag walk that added a challenge the walk was very picturesque and well worth the extra effort
Central Location - in the Heart of the City,We walked to Caract Gorge from our accommodation located in the heart of Launceston. We chose to do the walk alongside the Gorge and it didn't disappoint. The rock formations have various colourings within the rocks which change with the different times of day and the greenery along the way was beautiful and calming. We didn't get to use the chairlift as it wasn't operating at the time of day we chose to view this amazing site. The waterfall made for a beautiful photo as well as the bridges that encompass this beautiful Gorge - Birds could be heard in nearby trees as you meandered your way along to take in the views. A beautiful attraction well worth a visit in the heart of Launceston.
Saturday morning walk,"Myself and my partner started at the basin and took the chair lift. From there we did a short climb to a viewing point then did the 15 minute walk to kings bridge from there we came back by the zig zag route. It's a bit steep but not difficult, ending up back in the basin where there's a cafe. Good visit and we'll worth a trip. However when we got back to the Carpark our car and many others had received a $25 fine as there is no signage I felt this was a bit of a tourist trap we couldn't even see a parking meter. Disappointed to See this happening In Australia as it's more of the kind of thing you'd expect in Bali or Thailand."
Quick visit - this time,We’d left it very late in the afternoon but still thrilled we got a chance to ride the chairlift & see the gorge- spectacular! Such lovely scenery & friendly staff. Loved all the peacocks adding a splash of colour you!
Nice little park with peacocks ,Peacocks around the cafe. They are friendly and walk close up to human. The chairlift cable car is great experience. Nice and relax afternoon spent at the park.
Cataract fun!,The chair lift is really fun!! Great view plus! A scenic walk over the bridge! Peacocks and wallabies are EVERYWHERE!! )Daffodils in some of the fields! Very chatty and nice people selling tickets for the chairlift!
Delightful,"A great place to take time out with abundant walking trails, playground,  cafe/restaurant. Make a day of it and soak up the beauty."
beautiful walk,"walked here from our hotel, then walked the gorge to the swinging bridge. beautiful and very easy to walk"
Easy to explore,We had a relaxed morning at Cataract Gorge. There are walks of all varieties. Gorgeous place! We partially walked the zigzag trail and saw a number of wallabies and variety of birds. We also enjoyed the walk along the suspension bridge. Paths are accessible for all but as expected a few hills. The “inclinator” allows for those less able bodied to avoid some of the hills and get down to lower level. We enjoyed a nice meal at the cafe. Cafe was clean and staff friendly. Meals enjoyable. Parking costs...we paid $2 for two hours and it is a maximum of $6 if you wish to stay longer.
Just a lovely walk anytime of the year,As an occasional visitor I always find this a lovely walk.  The gardens at the end are always enjoyable and the peacocks and wallabies are great for the kids.
Cataract Gorge Reserve,One of the most beautifully presented Reserves have been to. Lots of different walks with lovely views. There is a lot of walking and can be quite steep for those like myself who aren’t very fit. The chairlift was great too.
A fine place to go on Sunday,"I go there every Sunday with my two little ones. A lovely place as it is, it would be heaps better if the wallaby poos can be cleaned regularly."
Scenic beauty,"Cataract Gorge boat tour was very informative followed by the walk 1 km to Cataract Gorge Reserve where we enjoyed a casual stroll over the suspension bridge and came down on the chairlift. Magnificent views. 2 cafes on sight. Peacocks and wallabies roaming around, very friendly. A must to visit when in Launceston."
Walking in Cataract Gorge.,Stunning scenery & a must see if you are in Launceston. We walked into the gorge from Launceston town centre. We are in our early seventies & found it quite an easy walk.
"It was interesting and so close to town,.","We had a short stop in Launceston, and drove out to see the gorge. We went for an interesting walk, signposted with information regarding plants and First Nations peoples uses for them. Walked over the suspension bridge and back to the car.In summer this would Be a great place to stop for a swim, as there is a pool, with a large children’s area, with good change rooms and showers.There is also a cafe and a cable car. We didn’t use the cafe or go on the cable car, but enjoyed our short time here and our encounter with the resident peacock."
Cataract Gorge,What a surprise—this gorge is right in the city of Launceston in Tasmania!  Free to visit and walk through with lovely picnic grounds and a cafe.  There is a skylift that is relatively inexpensive and gives beautiful perspectives of the gorge.
Lovely historical area and free facilities,"The gorge in Launceston is a beautiful area with so much interesting history. Lots of great walking tracks with differing  levels of difficulty, a restaurant, cafe, playground, swimming pool, chair lift and lots of beautiful scenery. There is no cost to get in which makes it even better! You could spend the best part of a day here in good weather if you dont mind walking. I love the peacocks that can be seen in the gardens"
What a stunning location ,"Right in the city, I still can’t get my head around this magnificent gorge, it’s s a stones throw from the city centre. Great walking track, so much to see and do. It’s just a stunning place to spend the day."
Great restaurant,Highly recommend. Service good. Food good too. Great location. Can be noisy but good atmosphere. Depends on what you like.
Short Stay,"An excellent day trip on the edge of Launceston.I recommend the chairlift and then the hike to the lookout, if you're fit.It's an easy walk down and across the suspension bridge.You're sure to come across wallabies, peacocks and maybe a wombat!"
What a gem so close to Launceston,"What a great place to visit and also free. Could easily spend a half day walking around and admiring the postcard like scenery. Beautiful in any season, totally recommended."
Great place for a leisurely walk..well worth a visit,"Easy access by foot (10-15 min) or car( 6-7 min) from town centre. If you are in good shape and like hiking,  I recommend walking the whole area for a couple of hours if weather is good. Scenery is gentle and pretty rather than wild. You bump into kangaroos, birds and peacocks in the grounds. If you are pressed for time or cannot do so much walking then the 2 seat  the gentle chairlift is a good option with one way or return tickets available. Definitely a pleasing and must do  excursion if you are in Launceston."
Peaceful scared place ,Very well looked after - we went to basin one which has a chair lift $13 per adult which is slow and not too scary.A few really lovely short walks and displayed history dotted about.There is swimming pool -Good amenities and a cafe And it’s Free to visit
Great views and peaceful,We enjoyed our visit of the Cataract Gorge. As you drive up the hill you get beautiful views of the mountains. The weather is beautiful. Of course you have to be careful as the roads are abit windy and so keep to the speed limits. My family enjoyed the breath taking views and scenery.
Great,Well worth it. Whatever cruise you choose  it's all ok. This place is special geologically and spiritually.
"Not bad, good for picnic","Isn't a great place, ropeway is reasonably priced. you can also walk to the other side by 2 different paths. Good for picnic. view is good. peacock sighting."
A little gem ,What a great spot on a sunny day great walking and the highlight local wildlife and that chair lift !
A place worth visiting,"Cataract Gorge was on my to-do list for Launceston. Since it was a beautiful day, I did the Zig Zag trail walk. While it was a moderately hard walk, it was worth the effort. I started the trail near the chair lift and did a loop through the bridge (near the road) and came back to the cafe. The bridge offered a good angle for photographs. The benches. gardens, peacocks and the various small birds added to the beauty of the place. I did not try the chairlift since I needed the exercise. Good shoes and a bottle of water is a must for those attempting the zig zag trail. After a brief stop at the cafe (First Basin) for coffee, I left."
Worth a visit,"This is a very attractive gorge with an easy walkway and fun chairlift. Lovely park like area with wonderful playground, toilet facilities and an open swimming pool for  use in the summer.Very pleased we made the effort to go here."
Lovely walks,There are easy and hard walks so make sure you choose what id right for you. refreshments at the first basin.
So pretty,The chairlift ride was fun.I am not a fan of heights but this was great.pretty views and an easy pretty walk back to the car.A beautiful park for a picnic.Nice wildlife with wallabies and peacocks.We went late in the afternoon but lovely cafes.
Gorgeous views and a good walk,"At 7am there was hardly anyone around. Great views and a nice way to get some exercise. A short walk from the city centre, it's very easy to find. There's 2 options to walk or do half/half."
Great day out,Close to Launceston this is a great place to visit. We took the ride across the gorge with great views walked across the bridge and enjoyed our visit. lots of grass for the kids to run around would be a lovely place for a picnic there is also a play area for the kids.
Lovely place,"We went and checked out this place. Such a lovely place to stroll around and even better to grab a coffee or a bite to eat and just sit and relax. Great for kids to run around, awesome in Summer time for the kids to have a swim in the pool. Just a beautiful place all together."
Nice spot,Worth having a look. There's a couple of nice walks. Recommend the chair lifts they are cool. Even go down there and have a picnic. There is a cafe.
A Day of Play,"What a wonderfully magical place!  It’s like stepping back in time.  The peacocks that meander amongst the native and introduced species, that spread around the manicured gardens of the NW entrance (Trevallyn) to the Gorge, are just beautiful and very tame.  The band stand and cafe lend a feeling of days gone by, and the chairlift ride across the Gorge is just breathtaking.  Having the option to walk across to the Basin Cafe and swimming pool (SE side - West Launceston) is just wonderful, as was the delightful possum we found foraging inside the rubbish bin at the Gorge Cafe.  The children’s sculpture water park at The Basin is clever and kept kids, young and old alike, totally mesmerised.  A fantastic day out!"
Stunning!,"It is a rare natural phenomenon embeded in the city. The walk on the tracks is relaxing for cataract walk, it is about 1km. There are peacocks near the cafe. There is a charlift service, which you can catch a good view of the gorge."
A place almost out of a fairy tale.,The Gorge is situated so close to the city it is hard to believe it is there. The Chairlift was so much fun and the kilometers of walking tracks were fun to explore.. we probably did about a 3rd of them and still covered 6km in the afternoon. The natural rock formations and mirror waters in the gorge were fantastic. A wondrous place.. We will come back one day and explore more.
Such an amazing place,Cataract Gorge should be on every visitors ‘to see’ list. It is a beautiful spot and only a few minutes from the town centre.
Scenery ,"Beutifull Just to visit and see, walk the view. Did not do much being winter but its refreshing scenery."
Lovers Lock Location ,"We had the pleasure of visiting this beautiful city and taking in the sights of Cataract Gorge. The chairlift is an awesome experience and the cafe has a great selection of foods. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We are planning our return in 2021.Lovers Lock Location,  on the side fence, before the Swinging Bridge on the Cafe side. ( No Locks on the Bridge.)"
Brilliant ,We were touring Tassie by car and a long walk was just what we needed.Lovely views. Well sign posted and very interesting facts and pictures were all along the route.The middle grassed area was delightful and the peacocks an added delight. The walk back we avoided but were sorry we didn't attempt it.Great place and it's free and healthy.
Lovely Place,"Lovely place, we did the zig zag walk and then crossed the bridge and returned on the cataract walk. The zig zag was a little strenuous but well worth it, and made the leisurely walk on the cataract walk all the more enjoyable. Did the chair lift back across, that was nice a slow and fine for someone who is a little nervous of heights :)"
Cataract Gorge Walk from Kings Bridge.,"Walked from the Kings Bridge to the cafe. Very peaceful, easy walk. Interesting signs on the way and a beautifully laid out reserve."
Amazing place,"Cataract Gorge Reserve is a truly amazing place with terrific facilities that cater to everyone. The cafe, with its wide glass windows and walls is really the perfect place to start your exploration of this natural wonder. The Gorge walks are easy and very informative, with a new landscape and story around every bend. A must see!"
A Must See,"It is so strange having something like this within walking distance of the city, definitely a  must see. Even though it rained on and off while we were there, we still thought it was amazing. The picnic area looked great and had a pool for the warmer weather. There are various walks for all fitness levels as well as a Kiosk and restaurant. There is an incline getting to the picnic area and pool but there is an inclinator that takes you to the various levels - this is free to use.There is also a chair lift for those that don't want to walk to the other side, but you do need to pay for it. We also saw plenty of Peacocks and Wallabies."
Amazing scenery so close to the city,"A trip to the Gorge is always a must when you visit Launceston. There are a number of walks (30 minutes to 4 hours) with amazing views, scenery and wildlife to see along the way. There is also a cool cafe and chairlift too."
a good place to go,"The place is accessible, just 5-10 mins drive from town centre.  If you take the Tiger Ride free bus, it is very convenient and comfortable.  The place is not as beautiful as what we expected but the chair lift, which lasts for 5 mins, is quite fun.  You may buy a return ticket and go up to the other side and take a short walk along the zigzag track and see the gorge and the interesting rock nearby (like the dog head rock).  And there is a cafe where you may have some refreshment, though the quality is so so.  Or you may buy one way ticket to go up and walk down via the bridge, which may take no more than 30 minutes.  Overall, it is a quite worthwhile to go for a relaxing morning or afternoon."
Always enjoy the gorge,Very few cities have such a phenomenal natural attraction so close to the city centre. Launceston is worth the visit just for a walk up the gorge.
"Friendly, clean ,relaxing, fun for all the family","We were travelling around Tassie is a 6 berth Apollo van. There was plenty of free parking, lots of room everywhereIt’s clean , tidy and cheapYou can get a meal, sit by the gorge or use the cable car as we did to see the gorgeous view There is a playground and cafe Recommended"
Stunning you location,"Visited with my family, we all enjoyed the chair lift and the stunning gardens. Such a beautifully set out area. The walk to the top of the gorge was pleasant and easily managed."
Sightseeing ,Lovely walks on well made paths and cool swinging bridge. Cafe overlooking the Gorge. Informative signs of Flora and Fauna
Beautiful walk,We parked in the carpark and were able to follow the signs easily to the various trails. Absolutely beautiful scenery and a pleasant morning walk.
Gorgeous location ,We visited the Gorge and found the experience really lovely. The scenery was really nice and everyone who we spoke to working there was really helpful. Would definitely go back!
Great walk,Walked from my accommodation in the city to the gorge. Signage is quite good if you are walking and not driving.  If you have average fitness take your time. Enjoyed a coffee and cake at the cafe when I arrived. The toilets are in the rotunda.
Good walk alongside the river,We took the chair lift downhill and then did the riverside walk.  It said that it was for hikers but we were just on an afternoon walk and found it easy enough to get to the end (the power station).  Some good views of the river from above.
Great view from the chairlift,"Loved this place. So beautiful and my kids dont usually like to walk very far but we all enjoyed the cataract walk and the scenery was incredible,"
So beautiful ,A must when in Launceston and very spectacular at the moment with so much water in the gorge and the chairlift ride is a must
Beautiful park and gorge with a historical side!,"We went on the chair lift which was quite fun, nice views. It has a strong Victorian influence around the park, with a couple of cafes and walks for all ages and abilities. We saw peacocks and a kangaroo and we enjoyed reading about the history of the gorge and park."
A must see in Launceston,We walked along the seafront on the board walk and then into the Cataract Gorge. The walk along the right hand side of the Gorge is not too steep and it is a pleasant walk.
Beautiful,We went in the early morning and it was lovely. The water levels were up so unfortunately couldn’t cross the water. Plenty of wildlife and beautiful walks
A free trip at your leisure,The beauty of this trip is Free，a  rarity in  Launcheston。Take the free Tiger BuS around 9。40，l2。40  and 15。40  to the Gorge。You  can haue a haIf hour walk to King's Bridge and take the board walk。  If you  do not walk the  whole way，take the  chair lift ($  13 One  way，$16 return)If you take it (not the feint  heart ) make Sure you hang on to your  phone/Camera/wallet/handbag  because ot gravitation pull。The reserve has a pool and a suspension bridge。You pay over $50~60  for a half day tour。
Great chairlifts ,Would recommend all families with young children to spend a day at this place.  Don’t limit your children’s time at this place.  Make sure you go to the cafe overlooking the swimming pool and play area and go up to the cafe in the middle of the park near the end of the chairlift and next to rotunda.  J could write for pages on this place but take your children on the chairlift and walk as much as you can around this great natural area.  Loved it so much and children loved it too.  Get the car parking app too as very handy to add time to your parking especially on the long walks saves you coming back to top up time.
Great new kids play area,"One of my favourite must visit places in Launceston.  The natural beauty, elegant history, and modern conveniences combine to create a haven of relaxation on the city's edge.  We were delighted to discover that a new natural interactive play space has been created for children of all ages.  The timeless play materials of sand and water allow for hours of occupation.Being able to observe wallabies, pademelons and possums emerge at dusk is a special experience.  Visitors should be mindful that attempting to hand feed these wild animals and the peacocks is a bad idea as it encourages pest behaviour."
Haven’t been for a long time,"Walked from the Penny Royal into the Gorge, it is a reasonably flat easy walk with some nice viewing points along the way.We walked over the suspension bridge. The pool was very dirty (green) obviously not being used. The park has some great play equipment for the kids they especially like the “hamster wheel”. We saw/heard peacocks along the way. We decided to walk back out the Zig Zag track, this track is a bit more of a challenge so may not suit everyone. (Steep in parts and stairs) Stopped at a viewing platform about half way to have a different aspect of the river. We enjoyed our visit and the walk."
Great Spot For a Walk,Really enjoyed the visit. Parked up the street to avoid paid parking in the main reserve car park and walked in. Headed over the suspension bridge and walk to Penny Royal and back again. The walk was fantastic with lovely views and some informative plaques outlining history of note. A relaxing couple of hours.
