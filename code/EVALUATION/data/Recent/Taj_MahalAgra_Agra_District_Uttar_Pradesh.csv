Excellent excursion ,"Some 388 years ago, Shah Jahan built this marvel to illustrate the adoration he held for his deceased wife. The result? A stunning structure nearing architectural perfection enjoyed by millions.On entering the complex, you are presented with the postcard perfect imagine of the Mahal in all its symmetrical brilliance, mystified by a veil of morning mist. The allocated three hour time slot affords plenty of time to enjoy the grounds and surrounding structures which are definitely worth a look albeit less grand than the main attraction. On approach, you are requested to remove your shoes/apply shoe covers to help preserve the white marble surround. This area offers the instagram enthusiasts a fantastic opportunity to capture that like conjuring selfie. For a small fee of around 200R you can enter the upper promenade and even go into the Mahal to observe the marble interior. Personally, after the grandness of the exterior I found the inside a little underwhelming but for the few minutes it takes to see it’s worth popping your head in. Walking around the exterior of this upper level definitely presents the best opportunity for you to appreciate the time and consideration given to it’s construction. With tickets costing 1250R (£13.50/$17.00) the excursion is certainly value for money.  Five stars doesn’t begin to do the experience justice."

It's Beautiful... ,Taj Mahal is beautiful if you select the correct time which is early morning or late evening but check the entry timings which are till 5 PM only.  It's not just the Taj Mahal but the massive gardens and the entry gates and the Yamuna river at back that enhance it's beauty and what more can I say where billions might have visited before me..... Highly recommend but go at right time and in the right weather which is winters.
Good,Best place I've ever visited in my life agra is the city of heritage and one of the place with a wonder of the World.
Beware of Guides and expensive shops,"Taj Mahal is great site to visit but be careful of the tourist guides. First they show you around which is all good but at the end they will say that they will take you to see local craftsmen. Then they will take you to big and expensive private shops where the guides have their commission fixed. Only one fake craftsman will be shown to you sitting at shop entrance just to give you a false impression.Once inside, you will get all things super expensive in these stores. If you go to other smaller stores nearby you can easily get same goods at half price and also do price negotiation. FINAL WORD: Once you are out of Tak Mahal just pay the guide and leave, do shopping yourself. don't be fooled by any talk of seeing local craftsmen or museum."
Just Beautiful,"just Amazing considering was built 400 yrs back.Beautifully designed  and well maintained , looks wonderful at night"
UNIQUE BEAUTY MADE OUT OF PASSION,Its Uniquely made.Took 20 years for this masterpiece.Wonder how they did this.Great architect considering bult anciently
Looks different at sunrise and sunset,The Taj Mahal is one of the most recognizable iconic scenes in the world. When we visited we were so lucky to be staying overnight in Agra so that we got to see the wonderful look of the white marble mausoleum both at sunset and again at sunrise.
Beautiful Monument,"Such a beautiful place,. what an incredible architecture. No words to explain the beauty of this place. Must visit monument in India."
Monument of Love,Tajmahal is amonument of love constructed by Emperor Shahjahan in fond memories of his wife Momtaj mahal in1648.Its made of white marble  in a garden 980 square feet In the west there is  mosque and in the Esat a guest house . These two are made of red sandstone gives a contrsting look. The main door is a arch type wit a dome on top .The walls are decorated with caliography . At the back of Taj Jamuna flows quietly . Shahjahan had a plan to make another Taj accros Yamuna but by then he lost his power to execute it .To watch Taj its best either in the morning or the late afternnon  so that one is not caught by sun.
The TAJ,"Taj has a everlasting mesmerizing beauty which no other monument has.It was built by Shah Jahan for his eternal love Mumtaz, it's  a wonder in marble to be seen again and again"
Arno,"It was a wonderful experience, especially if you go early in the morning, when the crowd is not there yet. A guide is indispensable, I think, to get the most of it."
Gold of world,Beauty of world. Superb place. Just relax in garden & view it. It's a diamond of India. Don't miss it. Beautiful carving
Anil Sen Verma,"Taj Mahal is an amazing master piece,archectural bueauful monument,,,indentification of India,,,a must visit in India"
Simply Amazing,"On the second day of our trip we woke up early. bleary eyed but excited at the same time as we were meeting our guide in reception at 6am to head to the Taj Mahal for sunrise. The entrance was only a ten minute walk away so we joined what felt like a pilgrimage along the long straight road and path to the entrance being past occasionally by large golf buggies (not really golf buggies but you know what I mean) taking larger tour groups. When we got to the entrance we just stood and waited whilst our guide got our tickets (another huge advantage of having a guide was that you felt totally relaxed as we saw quite a few independent people looking confused as to where to go and what to do. One poor French chap had almost reached the actual entrance when he realized that this was not where you got tickets so he had to go running all the way back, get his ticket and join the back of the queue again. I felt so sorry him but thankfully we saw him later inside so we knew he had worked it out).We then joined the actual queue to get in and at this point I literally had butterflies in my stomach and I was bouncing a little on my fight in anticipation almost like waiting for the gates to open to get in to see your favourite band in concert. The sky looked overcast so we did feel a little disappointed that we wouldn't see the sunrise (we needn't have been :-)) but just as we realized we would wouldn't see a sunrise a large troupe of monkeys decided to entertain us by climbing and jumping along the rooftops silhouetted in the early morning light and yet again we smiled not quite believing we were actually there. Then the gates opened and the anticipation and murmurings began to rise (the opening lines of Juke Box Hero by Foreigner were going through my mind if anyone remembers it) and you could literally feel everyone's excitement. We entered around 0645 first of all entering in to a large courtyard with high walls (look out for monkeys scrambling along the tops), impressive gates and garden and we were already in awe. Our guide gave us some of the background although in truth I was finding it hard to concentrate on what he saying as I was to busy soaking up what we were seeing whilst at the same time itching to walk through the arch to see the Taj Mahal fully. Finally it was time to make our way towards the arch and through it. The arch itself is very impressive and makes for a great photo opportunity of framing the Taj Mahal and with each step we took we became more and more in awe and just mesmorised by what stood before us. It really is just one of those most incredible wow moments and words can't come close to describing it (so you will just have to go :-)). Despite the lack of a sunrise we didn't need to have felt a little disappointed earlier as the white, misty background whilst not great light for photos added a whole magical, mystical unique atmosphere that really is hard to describe. It truly is one the seven wonders of the world.Our guide continued to tell us the fascinating history, and art behind the complex although the time our eyes were just being drawn to the magnificent buildings. At times as cheesy as it sounds I literally had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat finding the whole experience quite emotional in a good. Due to the changing circumstances we were told it was relatively quiet (we actually had a couple of groups of Americans rushing back as we were entering even though we were there at the opening time as they had literally just managed to see a glimpse of the Taj before having to rush back and travel to Delhi for the last flights back to the US) and there was no queue at all to get in to the interior of the tomb where photography is not allowed and where shoes are removed or shoe covers provided. Again the artwork and history is fascinating and our guide was just brilliant pointing out various features tat we would never have noticed without him. We then exited the interior before soaking up the views from behind the Taj over the river to the gardens where we had been the late afternoon before. Looking at the Mosque, the Guest House, the minarets with everything in perfect symmetry except for one detail and that being the replica coffin (directly above the real one) of Shah Jahān as he only decided to be buried there shortly before his death.We continued to walk slowly just taking it all in with all the different angles and views still having to pinch ourselves, Eventually and reluctantly we made our way back to where we entered although constantly turning round to take in the scene and smiling as we would spot another monkey high on the red stone walls. I can honestly say that this was one of the best experiences of our travelling lives (although The Amber Fort later in the trip probably matched it but in a different way so it would be wrong of me to compare)."
"Taj Mahal, 'nough said.","What's there to say. It's the Taj Mahal, one of the most well-known buildings in the world. The whole complex is beautiful. Crowded, yes, even if you go there at opening time. There's no escaping the crowds, but it's still worth it. Morning is the best time to go. Watch the colours change as the sun comes up. It's absolutley stunning."
Amazing!,"It was the last day of our two-week business trip in India and I am not going home without seeing Taj Mahal. From the parking area, we took a shuttle going to one of the gates.We had a private tour and much of it was already pre-organized. However, we paid for the entrance fee ourselves. We were given a shoe cover and a bottled water along with the ticket. Don't forget to bring your passport with you as they ask for it.For a smoother access to the area, do not bring big bags or too many stuff with you as much as possible. There is a security check at the gate and they are really strict. Don't forget a camera though!  There are also separate lines for men and women. Aside from the scanners, they also gave us a body check. That body check was weird! The security guard's touch was different and he squeezed my buttocks.The line was not that long but the whole area is really crowded. You need to be patient to get that perfect photo!The architecture is really amazing that you can stare at it for a long time. It is good to have a tour guide as you will be informed of its history and many trivial information. The garden is also vast and lovely. It is also nice to just sit at a bench and enjoy the view.There are photographers around who will take your pictures and upon exit, you can buy the already printed copies. Just before you enter the main building grounds, you have to use the shoe covers! The main building is huge, although I always thought that it is huger. Your are allowed to enter it but only one small room can be visited. The details of the walls of the main building is really nice, you have to come closer to see the carved colorful stones that decorates the walls.We were told that it would be nice to visit it twice on different times of the day as the building's color changes due to the sun's reflection. Some people also visit it at night on a full moon."
Mind Blowing!  Best Instagram Shot Locations.,WOW...it lives up to being one of the wonders of the world.  Make sure you are there before dawn and have a great guide!  We've done a full video of the area including all the best spots for great Instagram shots so you can spend less time taking pictures and more time taking in the site.  Search for DOUGandNIKI on YouTube for the video.
good,The minarets and other features such as the dome and the beautiful pool is absolutely  spectacular. I adore this building.
Scenic place,"Very nice to finally have been here. Very crowded, but this was not a surprise. Due to construction work there were a bit less crowded, so it was quite ok. Got to see it all, so another thing off the ""to do list""."
"Go early, bring you camera, plenty of patience and little else.","We attempted to go at sunrise as soon as they opened and while we arrived only shortly thereafter it was still a bit crowded, but from what I understand in Taj Mahal terms the place was empty.  Buying out tickets was easy but a little confusing so I am glad we had our guide with us.  Also note they they provide free shoe coverings, so get them before going in otherwise you will have to buy some to enter the actual buildings. Bring as little as possible, the security while friendly, nice and quick is pretty strict. Bring patience and plenty of it.  Everyone is trying to get the same photos and sometimes you have to wait to get to the front of group or the middle/perfect spot.  Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to defend your spot in line.  There were a couple of times where I patiently waited my turn to get to the front of the center of an area to get just the shot I wanted.  I waited my turn But when people behind me started to get nasty about waiting their's I sternly told them if they kept it up they were  going to have to wait longer.  So go in there knowing you may have to wait, don't be ""that person"".  We went with a guide and while not required I recommend doing so, for a few reasons.  They were able to tell us way more than we would have learned on our own.  Also, it seemed like every guide knew just how to take picture to make it look like you were the only ones there!  Having someone with you who knows this made out pictures that much better."
Magnificent,Its truly one of the world wonders. The site has a lot of history and culture and you can't just leave without immersing your self into this gigantic landscape.
Well A Word Beautiful,Tajmahal comes in 7 wonders of the world and whenever i got a chance to be here it proved me well.Taj Mahal is beautiful architecture which was built by shahjahan in the memories of her wife mumtajTalking about my experience it have 2-3 gates for entry and the zone is totally environment friendly So there are only electric vehicle to be allowed.And Overall its a good fantastic place
A wonder of the world,"We were lucky enough to get to the Taj two days before the close it for the pandemic, therefore it wasn’t unbearable crowded. We were literally the first ones to get there a little earlier that 6am. We could have good views and nice pics also. It’s beautiful to see the sunrise reflecting on the white marble.Some tips: we got our tickets online a little cheaper than at the gate. When we entered we were asked for a tocken that is given when you buy the tickets at the office. That was a little trouble but we could enter scanning the bar code. We didn’t get the bottle of water and the shoe cover they give you with the tocken but before entering the area if the mausoleum itself you can get the shoe cover from the security. You are not allowed to enter otherwise. Also, the slot you book has an time limit which is not really checked upon exiting the area or maybe we were lucky. Last thing, as in most of the wonders of the world the harassment agains the tourist is insane. Make sure you keep your pockets secure (someone try to steel from us) and your patience at high levels."
beautiful building,"this is amazing and beautiful building, it is a historical building, i heard about it but it is the first visiting. i recommended to visit it"
Fantastic building,With the help of our guide we saw this beautiful building from all angles and the visit was a wonderful experience
Stunning,Stunningly beautiful. The Highlight of our North India Tour. A magical place not to be missed. Probably best done as part of a tour so that as much information as possible is gained but just being there is awsome.
My Amazing Experience With One of The Seven Wonders of The World Taj Mahal.,"Wow!  What an amazing journey it was, I was really excited to visit India and for me it is very hard to pick the best moment or place of India which topped my list and shocked me due to its beauty and magnified aura. But if I have to talk about one specific location and monument that really comes in my mind or a synonym of beauty and excellent art design that it is none other than ""Taj Mahal"".Taj Mahal was built by Shahjahan who was a ruler in India during 17th  Century if I am not wrong. He built due to one reason, his wife Begum Mumtaz during his last time said to Shah that she wants a wonderful monument for their love so that their love will be remembered for years.It is full white marble and it is saying that ""No artist or engineer has the potential to draw this type of monument in future which makes it a wonder after all.From a visual point of view, park, atmosphere, guide, stories, mystery, beauty, Yamuna river, and calmness which makes Taj the eternal beauty and a symbol of ancient Indian architecture skills.You have to visit Taj once in your life and I promise that you will immerse in its divine beauty.Thanks!"
excellent,With Mr Syed's help we explored the city of Taj . It was an awesome experience. He planned our visit in such a manner we can explore everything in a short span of we had at our hand. Thanks Mr Syed will again give you trouble
excellent,It was a beautiful experience cant't wait to visit again and thanks to Mr Syed who was such guiding force
Breathtaking!,This was my first visit to India and the obvious place I wanted to see was the Taj Mahal. We went to see it at sunrise and OMG...it was awe inspiringly breathtaking!!The photos that I had since a young age don't do justice to it. It is so much more beautiful in reality.
"An architectural marvel, but that's not it!","There is so much more to visiting the Tajmahal than admiring its architectural might, prowess, and secrets that many Harvardians cannot decipher! There is a story. There are stories. You have to immerse in them and sink into oblivion to truly travel back in time and enjoy the visit!"
Evergreen always,This is my fourth visit to tajmahal. It always looks more better and beautiful than previous. December end is high time for tourist so it's better to be there on time. Hiring guide will be better way to see it. Entry ticket for tajmahal and Tom's entry ticket is different. One can buy tomb entry ticket from outside counter as well as there is a counter close to tomb to facilitate tourist who makes their mind to go inside after entering in main complex.   Remained closed on Friday and best time to view is morning and evening hours. Avoid foggy morning.
Amazing experience.,"What can one say about this famous monument and building? We have always wanted to see the Taj and were not disappointed. It is an amazing structure and the story behind it is also such a vital part of India’s history. Our group stayed at a nearby hotel which was only about 1.5 km flat walk to the Taj. We went late afternoon the previous day to a viewing area (by our small bus) to see the Taj at sunset – it gets very busy here so allow time to get a good place – standing or sit on a fence. Don’t miss the hordes of birds swooping and circling at sunset. Great photos! The main treat however is to rise early and walk from the hotel to the Taj for sunrise. You need tickets and one of our leaders went ahead and got the tickets as soon as they opened – it was still dark. The walk took about 15 minutes and we joined the queue forming to enter via the west gate. The first sight of the Taj is indeed amazing, the sunrises very quickly so do not be late – the colours and appearances change within minutes. The marble is almost translucent as it picks up the changing light. You have around 20-30 minutes and it is all over, take lots of photos. We had a guided tour which took about an hour and you learn the history, the intricacies of the building itself, the fact the minarets are on slight angles facing away from the Taj so in the event of an earthquake they would fall away from the beautiful building. You enter the tomb complex via a line that moves fairly quickly as you can walk past the final resting places of Shah Jahan and his wife, Mumtaz. You are not able to take photos within this area and unable to wear shoes here. There are good washroom facilities on site. The whole Taj experience took around 2 hours following which time we returned to the hotel for a hearty breakfast."
Enchanting everytime!,"This was my second visit to the Taj Mahal. The first time I visited Taj I was a teenager and its beauty stayed with me. This time I wanted my 12 year old daughter to see the Taj and I didn't expect myself to be enchanted again, but I was. The first glimpse of Taj Mahal through the entrance gates is truly mesmerising.There is so much to explore inside. We booked early morning tickets for both the Taj and the inner tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. The crowds were a bit less, but still there were plenty of people around. The Yamuna looked better than I recalled it and even the Taj looked whiter. There were monkeys about which my daughter found fascinating. And of course, it was pictures, pictures and pictures! What really amused me were the number of foreign ladies dressed in Indian Princess costumes, striking poses, at various strategic points, making right fools of themselves! Some seemed to be on a full photo shoot. I am not being mean, but very few foreign women can pull off the sari or the ghagra- choli or churidar- kameez well. Such inelegant antics aren't very classy.The last time I visited the Taj there was hardly any security, but this time around, there is a lot of security. So please travel as light as you can. And of course, try to steer clear of all the hawkers, touts, pickpockets etc who are going to besiege you, on your way to the Taj."
outstanding,been on the bucket list for a while.It was stunning.Got there at the end of the day so you could see the sun playing on the building as it went down.Will never ever forget this day.Take you time do not rush and sit down on the many chairs.
Experience of a Lifetime,"Neither words nor pictures can do this amazing piece of architecture justice.  It truly is something to be experienced. At first I was disappointed because heavy fog prevented our planned sunrise visit. But I now realize that anytime of day, this marvel will remain a wonder to behold. We were also fortunate to visit the gardens across the way at sunset, where you have a full view of the Taj Mahal from across the waters - so another great way to see this marvel at various times of the day. Do not miss!"
Beautiful while marbled building,"Having seen and read so much about the Taj Mahal that I was both impressed and underwhelmed. Impressive because it truly is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, and underwhelming because it’s the same as it looks in photos and documentaries.The best bit of actually seeing this white marbled mausoleum in person is to see up close the details of plant motifs on building walls, the Persian and Arabic calligraphy, and the inlaid pattern of jali lattices. The next best thing is the symmetric arrangement of four minarets that frame each corner of the tomb."
Wowed more than we expected!,"Because of its world-wide familiarity we thought it would be a bit of a cliche, but not so.  It is stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful and I was surprised to be quite moved.  We visited early morning but unsurprisingly there were many other visitors.  However, our entry wasn't held up and we didn't feel crowded out."
Must See This Amazing Place,"Up very early and off to Taj Mahal with our driver and guide,  Guide today did a great job and was very satisfactory. Long walk in to the Taj. Walk by the stables and into the center between four gates. Took 22 years to build the completecomplex (1631 to 1653). Built by the 5th Mogul. The main gate is the Rose or Royal Gate. 22 bells on top to signify how long it took to build. The first chapter of the Quran around the arch bottom right to bottom left. All 42 chapters of the Quran may be found on the interior of the Taj Mahal. Taj made from Macrona marble, from India. Active mosque to the left and guest house to the right of. Built on 42 acres. Persian ½ onion dome, Hindu lotus flowers and Chinese octagon shape. Four minarets tilt outward. The precious stone flowers inlaid into the marble are fabulous."
You simply cannot imagine how amazing this place is until you see it yourself!,You literally cannot appreciate the sheer beauty and splendour until you see it with your own eyes. It is absolutely magnificent. Its so amazing that it almost doesn't seem real. You MUST see it!
A true wonder of the world!!,This is probably one of the most beautiful man made construction I have seen in my life. Words cannot really explain what you feel when you enter the gate and have a first look on it. It just takes your breath away! I went there during the sunrise time as its the best time to enjoy without the whole crowds that gather to visit it. You can easily spend a couple of hours inside. There is an extra ticket to enter the mausoluem where you have the tombs but I didn't but that one. I am planning to go to India once more just to visit the Taj.!
Breath taking,The Taj Mahal is absolutly breath taking. It's a place you have to see in your lifetime. Must be the most impressive place I have ever been.
Absolutely stunning ,We visited Taj Mahal whilst in India last year. An absolutely incredible experience! We got there at sun set for when the gates opened and I would definitely recommend doing this because there was hardly anyone in our photographs!
Just magnificent,"An unbelievable experience, I thought I knew what to expect but being there was so much better. In the evening we viewed the sun setting from the garden across the river on the other side of the Taj Mahal. Then went into the Taj Mahal the next morning."
No must see,"A beautiful place often visited by tourists. However, on-site construction is not as impressive as on postcards. If you have time, you can visit, but it's definitely not a must-see for traveling around India. Prices for white tourists as per Indian conditions. The fountain cleaning system was interesting and we were surprised by the fog, which lasted until 10.00."
Majestic Mausoleum,"The Taj is set in the middle of a large garden area next to a river. It is fabricated of all hand carved white marble and the detail once inside is stunning. Be sure to look up also. No pictures, food/water are allowed inside. Definitely best to come early to avoid the worst of the crowds. Depending upon how long you linger for pictures, the visit can take 2-3 hours."
A MAGICAL MOMENT.,"A magical visit in the early morning mist. One more.  off the bucket list. I possible, do the visit in the morning, it is less crowded and much cooler than any other time of the day."
Lovely India (Hindustan),"Beautiful culture and fascinating architectureWe had a good time, but make sure if you go on summer you're hydrated enough, it can get pretty warmIn Iran we call India, Hendoostan, and ""Doost"" in Persian means friend (Doostan mean friends), and when you hear Hendoostan, you sorta hear Indian buddies! And saying ""I've been to Hendoostan"" sorta sounds like ""I've been with Indian friends""! Which totally describes our experience there"
Magical,"Magical experience, except for people asking for selfies and it was busy it was just so beautiful and amazing experience"
A waking dream !,It worth it for sure :)Lot of poverty in all Agra. Wish that the expensive entrance fees may be use to help people from Agra ... Where is going all these money that's the question?
this marble perfection brought tears to my eyes,"This is a stunning building and don't believe all you read that you must be there for sunrise to see a pink hue on the building! I went on a very cold, wintry day and silver light made the visit quite etheral. Of course the cold also meant there were far less visitors than normal so we were able to enjoy all the parts of the site in comforatable splendour. Just beautiful."
Why Very Good Only ?,"You may ask and I'll tell you. The Taj Mahal is Spectacular without a doubt. A wonderful story but lets not forget he was a Moghul Emperor who had the coffers to build this fantastic edifice to profess his love but Joe average didn't have that chance. So, the building is magnificent, the grounds beautiful but I found the interior and the sarcophagus to be bland, not up to the standard of the exterior ? Maybe that's just me ? But what really got up my nose was the no photo rule. We obeyed but 99% of the locals didn't and had their phones out snapping away as security idly stood by and let them ! So , the huge crowd was annoying & law breakers to boot ! Hope they take self isolation seriously ??"
The Taj,"Best way to see the Taj is at Sun rise (making sure the day you visit, you have checked the weather forecast),  be there 30 minutes before this time, to avoid any lengthy queues, queuing  will happen most times during the day. There are four entrances which can be used.  One crazy thing which you need to be aware of, is that video cameras can only be used at one location, then these cameras are to be put in storage lockers with a fee paid and a key given to you. For some reason those who have phones, filming is okay?  The great thing here is that you do have a two hour slot, which I saw as a benefit because there was no overcrowding (at this early time I went)It is truly overwhelming, due to its incredible size, notice the four corners all lean and the reason is so these tall structures fall away from the main central structure  in the event of any ground movement. We did take in shoe covers, for areas where you are meant take shoes off but covers are excepted.A wonderful two hour visit, with no pressure seeing all of the Taj in this time slot."
Visiting Agra,"Agra was our second stop in an amazing tour of Rajasthan which was booked through Shikhar Travels (Delhi). Our guide Mohd. Nadeem Khan was SO knowledgeable about this monument and made our tour exceptional in spite of the crowds. It IS possible to move away from the throng and find some beautiful peaceful areas to contemplate in this awesome place. Added bonus - our guide took us on a ""heritage walk"" on the other side of the river and gave us views of the Taj. that I expect most travelers do not get.  Yes it's very smoggy at that time of year (November) but get over it and do not miss going, early morning smog is not as bad."
Taj Mahal,"Went there for the first time, Love the taj mahal and it was a awesome experience. Love the inside and love the outside more."
At dawn - spectacular,"Too much has been said about it already, but no picture or words could do the sheer spectacle justice!"
A brilliant Persian architectural,"Taj Mahal (=crown palace) is a beautiful building. Except architecture, You can find many other Persian elements (Like poem, calligraphy, etc.) there, which looks like mosques and palaces in Isfahan. But Taj Mahal has a unique ivory-white color that differs it from other buildings all over the world. you couldn't bring any food to Taj Mahal. Javab (=answer) mosque (West of Taj Mahal) has a wonderful atmosphere and is good for taking picture (and praying). Taking photo inside the tomb area is forbidden but they take it easy. Original tombs are in the basement and what you see is not original one. The garden is a good for walking and see Taj Mahal from other angles."
Wow,"Photos dont do this justice its simply amazing. You have to see it for yourself to appreciate the true magnificence.Helps on the day we went only 14,000 visitors instead of the normal 22,000!"
Simply outstanding,"What ever you have seen or heard about the Taj is true. This is  a fabulous place to visit. The only downside is the total chaos at the entrance. For a World Heritage Site, the organisers have very little control. Pushing and shoving appear to be the order of the day. Suggest get there early!!"
Awesome,"The main reason for visiting Agra is to visit the Taj Mahal.  It is a splendid building, remarkably grand and better in life than photos.  We had an excellent guide (PK) who gave us good tips on the best views, quietest spots and loads of fascinating information about the Taj.We had a sunrise tour as we were told that this is the least busy time of day and because you can really grasp the full beauty of the building as the sun rises and highlights the colours of the marble and the additional shapes made by the shadows.  This is undoubtedly true but Donald Trump was at the Taj later that day and so a large number of tourists changed their itinerary as it was closed from 11 a.m.Be prepared to be searched as you enter the building and be prepared for your group be split up as men and women enter separately.  Do not take any unnecessary bags as they will be scanned separately - possibly some way from the gate that you enter through.  I am told this is normal and not because of added security for that day's VIP.Once inside enjoy every minute and do not get frustrated by other tourists as they push and squeeze for the best views.  You have three hours and your chance will come.  After you pass through the entrance hall you will see the Taj for the first time - remember it and compare the memory as the Taj changes with the rising sun and as the sky gets bluer.  It constantly changes and it is no surprise that most tourist leave with an album of photos.  The gardens on the approach to the Taj are immaculate and the centre pathway is quite crowded.  Take a couple of minutes to walk to the side and the whole place takes on a more peaceful tranquility. To the left and the right of the main building are identical structures - one is a mosque and the other a guest house that look magnificent but not as grand as the Taj.There is a steep stairway that takes you to the second level of the Taj.  You can walk around the whole structure and there are good views of the Taj and its surroundings.  You can go inside but have to remove your shoes or wear shoe covers.  Photographs are forbidden in the mausoleum.We enjoyed our experience and undoubtedly saw the Taj at its best in view of DT's visit.  They were still working on the preparation as we left at 10;30.  However, it did mean that we did not see the Taj as the sun went down because other parts of our itinerary were changed to work with the 'security shut down' for DT's visit.It was still a great experience and a must do if you are in Agra."
Exceeded my expectations ,A Must to visit and a guided tour. Outstanding place and gardens. Ticket is valid 3 hours once you are in. Not to be missed if you visit India and March is a great time to visit as if is not too hot but still shorts and T-shirt weather. The locals are annoying outside the gates trying to sell you souvenirs or begging.
A transcending view,"Obviously, the Taj Mahal means different things to different people. It is a temple of love.  It is a place where travellers have made it a lifelong ambition to get to. It is a worthy experience, as this building is truly glorious.  It inspires you and it gives you peace. My wife and I have planned a visit to India for most of our lives and now we are here, it is definitely worth it. This is the sublime spot that inspired us to come to India. We are travelling on a luxury guided tour of India from North to South and we have been humbled by the beauty of the scenery and the kindness of the people. This place is just heaven. We visited on a sunrise tour and later in the morning, we visited again for a tour inside. The historic gate, the gardens, the surrounding buildings all lend to the beauty of the wonderful Taj Mahal. A guided tour is not essential, but it is nice to learn about the history. A visit here is highly recommended."
Beautiful ,The history of the Taj Mahal coming to life. Beautiful  architecture and grounds with such rich heritage.
Awsome Beauty,"We had been dreaming for a long time about some day visiting the magnificent Taj Mahal after reading about it and seeing it on TV.  However, just seeing the Taj Mahal on TV and in magazines do not even compare to the ""feeling"" that you get while visiting this marvelous structure in person - walking up the long beautiful walkway from the entrance gate to the Taj Mahal itself.  The walkway from the entrance gate - which is beautiful itself - to the Taj Mahal through the beautifully landscaped gardens is a surreal feeling that is difficult to describe - like a ""dream"" feeling.  To the left side of the Taj Mahal is another lovely structure - The Taj Mahal Mosque, and to the right side of the Taj Mahal is the Taj Mahal Guest House which is identical to the Mosque structure.Visitors are allowed to go inside, but you must put on ""booties"" over your shoes to prevent scratching the marble flooring.  There is a very large upper level outdoor floor area that is nice to walk around and marvel at the marble flooring and wall structure - magnificent!  Also, the scenery view from this outdoor upper level is beautiful to see and take photos from.  Note:  NO Photos are allowed inside the Taj Mahal structure - Photo are allowed outside  the structure only.After visiting the Taj Mahal, we had finally fulfilled one of our of top ""places to visit"" listing, and we were not disappointed - I would highly recommend visiting the Taj Mahal while traveling in India."
Must See!,"You just have to see it.  The photos don’t do it justice.  One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it is well worth the visit.  The Taj was at its best the day we were there as President Trump was arriving later in the day."
Magnificent,Do the Agra Fort first to set the scene for your visit. The Taj Mahal was everything we expected and more. Hugely impressive and the highlight of our Indian tour.
Stunning experience T the Taj Mahal,The Taj Mahal lives put to all expectations and is a breathtaking sight to see.  Be mindful you have 2 hours to get round everything and be prepared for lots of people.  Nothing will prepare you for the first sight you have of this magnificent building and it’s history.  You can’t take pictures inside and watch people explain things and expecting tips.
Probably one of the most stunning sights on earth,"Didn't dissappoint, the sun was shining and it was absolutely stunning. The highlight of the trip to India"
Breathtaking!,Truly awe inspiring.  First glimpses take your breath away.  If you wish a professional photographer is on hand to take those iconic shots at INR100 for each photograph you buy.
Sunrise was the best time to attend,"Our tour group was given the option to go for sunrise which we all jumped on.  We were the first in line and it was definately worth it, we were able to get photos without to many people in the way. By the time we left, the crowds were really coming in. It is a very impressive building and if it is not on your bucket list, it should be!"
YEAH...OFF THE CHECK LIST !,What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said?Yup....its the Taj. It just twinkles when the sun light hits it.
Taj Mahal,So beautiful! Very impressive!We were so lucky to see it with few visitors the day before it closed due to Covid19
The Taj at Day Break,We were up at 6.30 am to walk the 10 min walk from the hotel to the Taj. It was not busy and we were some of the first through the gates by which time it was light. Definitely the best time to go if you want to avoid crowds. Nothing can prepare you for the beauty of this place. It is simply breathtaking and must be in the top 5 of world wide sights to see. The workmanship and detail is beautiful. The grounds are so peaceful and an aura of calm. To visit with family is a special thing as you enter and see the majesty of the building before you.
Good experience,"Visit with my family for the first time. Too much rush because of new year, but overall love the place. Send good time here with family."
Dream come true--breathtaking!,"Even though it was very hot and dry (97-98), we were happy to see beautiful blue skies for our visit to the legendary Taj Majal.  We got our first glimpse of the magnificent dome as we passed through the south arch and into the beautifully landscaped grounds.   We made our way toward the tomb, along the beautiful central waterway, taking pictures of the landscape and the amazing buildings, but also of the families and children we encountered.  They were all happy to pose for us and wanted to take pictures of us with their families.  We were overwhelmed by how friendly, welcoming, and warm they were.  The tomb itself was much smaller inside than we expected, but the intricately carved marble panels, inlaid with gems, that covered the walls were spectacular. The sarcophagi for Shah Jahan and his great love, Mumtaz Mahal, that we saw in the mausoleum were there for display only, as their bodies were actually buried in the basement below. This magical place, a symbol of great love, is definitely worthy of being called a “Wonder of the World.”"
Magical.,Our expectations were exceeded ten fold. A real goose bump experience. Nothing can match the magic of this stunning building.
Stunning!,"More than lived up to expectations. Lots of people but still didn’t feel too overcrowded. Knowing the story behind the building makes it more poignant. Once in a lifetime visit, would recommend adding it to your list of travel musts."
Lived up to expectations.,This building was everything we had hoped for and expected. We went at dawn and whilst it was busy it wasn’t overcrowded. Some great photo opportunities. The main reason to go to Agra.
Amazing,"Loved seeing the Taj Mahal. We had two visits with our guide, one in the afternoon and one first thing in the morning for the sunrise. Unfortunately, it was foggy so we could not see the sunrise but the structure is beautiful. It was very busy so get there well before the opening time. We took some great photos and it is quite a surreal place despite all the people. I loved it."
"The ""must have"" attraction of India","A nice, clean well known attraction of India. The differences between the dirt outside to the cleanliness inside is amazing."
WONDERLAND IN THE GLOBE,"It is a monument by King Shajahan for his lovely wife Mumtaj, Built in AGRA on the banks of Yamuna. It took 22 years to complete the Monument. Made up of White Marbles.The stones fixed on the Marbles are from Afganistan, AFRICA, Belgium, and India, It is one of the Seven wonders of the Land. It will look in different colours when the sun shines, after sun set, and full moon day."
Rare for an iconic place to live up to the hype,"Wonderful. As I said in the title, it's rare for an iconic place to live up to all the hype, but the Taj Mahal certainly did.  Visited in late February (two days after Trump!). The weather was sunny but not blistering.  The crowds were there but this is a bigger building and site than you imagine and the crowds didn't bother us.  We needed a wheelchair (wife's broken foot) and there are guys with wheelchairs willing to push you around. The price is negotiable but we paid 300R plus a generous tip because he knew the best ways round and great photo angles etc.  The chaotic entrance & security was the only downside to a magical visit."
Dense fog blocked the sunrise,I'm glad that I saw the Taj Mahal 25 years ago during sunrise and at dusk so I can recall how beautiful that day was. This visit was bitterly cold with dense fog which persisted during our visit and not letting up in time with our morning schedule. A few of us went back later that afternoon and viewed it from the other side - it is supposed to be the same from either side but I would rather have had the frontal approach with the gardens and water features.
Awesome,"One of the few places on earth that actually lives up to - and surpasses - expectations.We got there at around 3.30pm when the crowds had thinned and the changing hues - and mood - of the structure could be appreciated fully as the slowly sinking sun reflected off the Taj's gleaming marble facade. A truly emotional and unforgettable event.Top tip: optimise your first Taj experince by visiting either as a member of an organised trip, or employ the services of a local guide for a more personal adventure."
Stunning views,"Most people have seen that Taj Mahal in numerous photographs such as the ""Diana"" one and expectations are very high. The walk down to the ticket area is pleasant enough but watch out for thieving monkeys. We visited on a sat when the Taj had been closed for a VIP visit so it was incredibly busy. Our guide went and bought the tickets but we waited in a real scrum of people. Once through the ticket gate there are lovely grounds and you walk towards and entrance gate through which you see your first view of the Taj. It is a stunning building within beautiful gardens and a photographers dream (except that every single angle has been photographed thousands of times before. We visited for sunset and then dawn (much quieter) and enjoyed both very much."
Magical,A fantastic experience which lived up to all of our expectations. The inlay work on the white marble is majestic and the recent cleaning and repairs to the buildings have returned the Taj to its full splendour. Coupled with story of its construction it truly is a wonder.
An amazing icon,"We arrived before sunrise ( to watch the sun rise over the building and to beat the crowds) I was very much afraid that I’d built this place way too big in my head and that when I saw it I’d go “ ok that was alright, what’s next” but that’s not what happened, it was awesome, cannot explain my feelings, just put it on your list and do it."
Once in a lifetime visit,Arrived at sunset and even though raining was stunning.  Bit of a queue for epic photos but well worth it.  Quite a walk for those you are less able bodied but a once in a lifetime must do.  We arrived the day after Donald Trump so was looking exceptionally pretty with flowers
Magic Amazing monument,"Truly one of the biggest huge monument in this world, if you wish to visited keep on mind three simple thinks to duet, go at sunrise very early in the morning, the light reflecting the monument return as magic warm feeling, avoid crowdedness and confusions duet to lots and lots tourists, go with a local guide, there is huge important information to know in order to understand when and why have been built.If you follow this simplest suggestion you’ll remember and love it this place for ever.Even if you’re solo travelers don’t worry, place is safe, just avoid photography from tourists scams artists, is enough to say “no thank you” so you’re free to visit without getting continuously bothered from them."
It's the Taj Mahal. Nuff Said.,"C'mon, do I have to spell it out for you? The king who commissioned this nearly bankrupted his kingdom and had to be placed under house arrest by his son. You can safely assume that the Pearl of India is worth close scrutiny. Just don't go on Friday- that's a worship day."
Wonder of the world,"There's not really much I can write about the Taj Mahal that people don't already know.  It's one of the wonders of the world.Lots of tourists so try to get there early although you will still need to queue.  Our tour group got there before 6am and still wasn't first.After security screening, one of the first things one sees is the amazing entry gate.  Well worth taking time to check it out.Then the Taj Mahal appears like a white jewel.  It does change colour during the day depending on the light and when the sun is on the front the precious and semi precious stones glow amazingly.It's difficult to take a bad photo and there are a few places where you can get the reflection.  Very nice.We had a guide who gave us the history of the place and helped bring it to life.  A great way to do it if you want to get full value from the visit.Should be on everyone's bucket list."
Amazing,I watched the evening light fall on Taj Mahal from across the river and then visited early the next morning. It was shrouded in fog and beautifully mysterious. It is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.
Tour India and Nepal with Gate 1 Travel,Used Gate 1 Travel for an 18 day tour of Northern India and Kathmandu.  Highly recommend their service.  India and Nepal are places where only the most experienced travelers should head out on their own.  Let Gate 1 take care of everything for you.
Stunning,Absolutely breathtaking! Quite strict on what you can take into the Taj - have to scan handbags etc! Not really much else to say but definitely worth a visit!!
Stunning Monument of Love,"Built as the final resting place for a favorite wife of a king, the Taj Mahal is simply stunning. You can't take a bad picture of the buildings and grounds. And if you're lucky, you'll see some monkeys to boot! If you are anywhere near the area, go!!! You'll be so glad you did."
Worth it. Just go. ,Go early. Sunrise is amazing. Sunset on the opposite bank of the river in the park is beautiful too.
Meets the 5 star rating!,"When visiting the Taj Mahal it is easy to see why it is one of the seven wonders of the world. It is elegant , beautiful and is a unique ,architectural masterpiece located in Agra. We attended at 6:30 in the morning in the second week of March 2020.{ Note: Very few people are coughing or sick  in India !! LOL! All hotels we are staying at are temp. checking.!!] It should be noted that this monument is closed on Fridays for local Muslims to use for their own  religious activities. Entry was relatively easy, no crowds, just straight up to a ticket booth.We were given a bottle of water and shoe covers with entry which seems unnecessary and must add to the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in India. I am sure most people would have taken their own water bottle and the shoe covers were only needed if you were to buy the extra ticket needed to enter the actual area where the coffins are located.Perhaps they could be given out with these tickets to reduce the number? Our guide said only a small amount of tourists purchase this extra option.There are separate entry lines for males and females.[.I wonder what they do if you do not identify?] It is common practice in India  to  scan people. Women are taken, separately, into a curtained area   and everyones' bag is searched. You are only allowed to take a very small bag inside. I took my usual cross shoulder 20cm.x24cm.bag and that was fine. They only checked inside the large compartment. The check takes a few seconds......nothing too intimidating , so do not stress. It is to rule out terrorism. Guards carry guns at most, if not all, attractions.Food is not allowed to be taken inside the monument.  We did purchase  25 photos ,taken by a tout, for $2 Australia each . They were returned to our hotel in a folder , size 15x20 cms each. They were very nice although a few had shadows on our faces. Still, they were well worth the price compaired to Aussie photos!!  As we arrived early the sky was very white but as the time went on it changed to a gorgeous turquoise blue enhancing the white hue of the Taj .We also took our own photos with our mobiles and they turned out just fine. There are plenty of vantage points and benches available to pose on.You can get a few shots with reflections of the building by positioning your device near to the water features. The grounds are well maintained and we walked behind the main building and found a river and some local housing to the right.There was also cheeky monkeys and squirrels in the gardens . There were toilets located at the entrance that were clean for Indian standards. There was a toilet supervisor , although payment was not expected.This attraction is not to be missed and we are glad that we ticked it off of our bucket list. It is truly memorable.We stayed for around 2 hours . By the time we left it was getting a lot busier. Outside you are greeted by touts selling magnets , wooden elephants and booklets.etc They can be persistent , if not interested,  just tell them to ""GO Away."" and they will otherwise have a chat about India  They can be interesting ."
Monument to love -- and slavery,"The place lives up to its hype. Magnificent. Tour guides dwell on the fact that the king built it out of love for his wife. Beautiful! Of course, there is one nagging detail: He built it on the backs of thousands of slaves. Oh, the complexity of life.Go as early in the morning as possible."
Beautiful monumet. Skip going inside the mausoleum,"The monument itself is very beautiful. Here are some tips for Indian and Foreign tourists:- Book tickets online. During peak season, this will help you avoid the queue for tickets. - 5 - 10 mins on wikipedia will tell you all that you need to know about the Taj Mahal. Spend that 5 - 10 mins and avoid a guide to just know about the history. A guide is useful though in clicking photos on your mobile phone. If you need anything more than selfies with you in the photo, then you can opt for a guide. Negotiate upfront with the guide that he needs to take good photos. If you wish to avoid being scammed, tell the guide upfront that you dont want him to take you to any ""authentic"" shops to buy stuff. - Skip the mausoleum. Whether you are an Indian or non-Indian, the entry fee to the mausoleum is ridiculously high. For just going in and seeing two replica tombs and a few inner rooms (which have no architectural significance), it is not worth spending that extra money. During peak season, you can also expect a lot of crowd inside.- If you are traveling with infants, remember that only limited babyfood like milk powder or biscuits are allowed inside. Any other wet food like khichdi will not be allowed inside. So plan your visit accordingly. Feed your baby well before entering the complex.- Travel light. Mobile phones are allowed. Backpacks will not be allowed inside the complex. There are also restrictions on chemical items being taken into the complex. I heard that most makeup items are not allowed.- I personally enjoyed Agra fort and Fatehpur Sikri more than Taj Mahal because those places had more history and the guides were less of a rip off."
Beauty at its best,"Banane wale ne bhi kya bana daala.... superb work at that era when there was no technology and no resources. I wish just Govt takes care of it, which they arnt. Not the taj but surroundings needs a make over big time.Only trump visit made it possible for 2 days."
Spectacular ,"Taj Mahal is beautiful and a site to see. You cannot miss this when visiting India. A must see!! You have to go early, best to arrive at sunrise to avoid the crowds."
"Wow, it is definitely worth the hype!","I must say this was on my wife's bucket list not mine but after visiting the Taj Mahal it changed my mind.  The enormity and detailing of the grounds and the structures blew me away.  Pictures certainly do not do it justice.  If you are in India it is definitely worth visiting the small town of Agra just to see the Taj Mahal, you won't regret it."
Most fascinating place we've been to during our time in India,"Taj Mahal was our favorite, I can clearly say that. You might think it's overcrowded, but in Feb it was relaxed. We entered around late morning and there were not too many groups around. Our guide, we wanted to have someone with us to tell us more about it - keep it authentic, was experienced. He say he's done more than 1000 tours on Taj Mahal, that's probably 2-3 years of experience as he's offering 2 times. The palace is huge, I'm always impressed how human built places like this."
Spectacular!  Worth the long trip to get there!,"This was spectacular! We were extremely impressed. The photos don’t do it justice. The size is much larger than we expected and the grounds were lovely. If you can, try to see it at sunrise and sunset. The light constantly changes as the sun rises and sets reflecting off the monument. The interior is beautiful as well. We were so impressed and never dreamed this would be so beautiful.  One of the loveliest places we have ever been."
Wow! Amazing tour of Taj Mahal! You have to book with  Ajmal!,"This is a work of art! We had so much fun with Ajmal. He knows all the right angles and lighting to get all the Instagram worthy shots! I own a bohemian boutique in the UK and he was SO good. Not only is he a good photographer but he is very knowledgable, polite, kind. He got us in the que first too! His number +91 97569 69607"
A piece of history not to miss,Everything you have seen and read about but more.Once passed the outside world full of hustle and noise you enter a truly amazing and tranquil place.Security was good in comparison to other places.Gardens were very well kept and the numbers were reasonable but this may have been due to visitor numbers down due to coronavirus.Great photo opportunities and memories.
Wonder of the world - ticked,"We were fortunate there were blue skies o our view of the Taj were fantastic. We booked our visit to the Taj with a tour guide and by god it was a blessing. I think if we tried to venture by ourselves we would have regretted it big time! My biggest tip is prepare for lots and lots of people. When you arrive you have to queue to get tickets and chaos doesn’t even describe what is going on here. As foreigners you have different queues to locals so thankfully these are quicker and shorter but come at a price. Foreigners for the full tour pay 1300 rupees. But of a rip off to be honest when locals pay a fraction of it. With that entrance fee you get shoe covers and a bottle of water.They have restrictions on what you can take into the area, no food, carrier bags etc are allowed. This is checked on security. There are separate queues for men and women. Took a few minutes to get through. Once you are through it’s easy enough to get around and most people permitted on to the premises are only tour guides etc. So no one really hassling you. Our tour guide was our saviour and helped us get into good spots and area to take pictures. There’s plenty of areas to sit and relax and is quite systematic going into the taj too etc. At most you’ll only spend 10 minutes getting around. You spend more time outside. My main frustration came around the lack of queuing and people having the tendency to shove in etc. It seems to be a common practice and not specific to the taj. It’s definitely worth a visit and takes a full day from Delhi. It’s about a 3 hour drive each way which gives enough time to see the taj, fort and do some shopping."
Taj Mahal ,Blessed with the most gorgeous weather. The very reason to visit India and we switched our plans from a sunrise visit to sunset on recommendation from guide due to haze in morning lately. Amazing place and did not disappoint- feel very blessed
Bucket list tick and worth the wait,We went to see the TAj Mahal for a belated 25th wedding anniversary. It was worth the wait and everything we had expected plus more. You can read up on the history but this guy must have really loved his wife 😁To get to the entrance you need to take an electric car. No petrol card allowed near the monument. Very haphazard but eventually you get there!! To pay the foreign tourists get a slight discount when paying by card.  On the LHS of the box office. Inside prepare to be accosted by people wanting to take photos. There are some fun photos to take but luckily out guide was an enthusiastic amateur and happy to take for us.  Suggest you look at the photos people have taken and see where the good spots are from there. The Princess Di bench is not the only place to take a photo from!!We went during the day and then later that evening on the other side of the river to take pictures of th3 sunset. Magnificent and the TAj changes Colour with the change in light. Quite beautiful. The next morning we were back again at 0545 for the sunrise pictures. Unfortunately have to pay again and you just go in for 30 min to take photos. Worth it though as it was spectacular and the light just amazing. I was sceptical about going again but completely different feel and worth it.If I was going again I would do the fort in the afternoon and then see the TAj in the evening from across the river. Then go early and do the sunrise and then have the full tour after that. That will save you the cost of the additional entrance fee. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!!
Absolutely stunning!,"A stunningly beautiful place to visit, with beautiful surrounding gardens and buildings.  Good to visit in the sunshine and also as the sun begins to set.Surpasses all the hype!"
Beautiful and disappointment,"I learned about this building since I was in school about 50 years ago. The building is impressive and so a lot of hype came along with it. The background story of this famous building has an equal epic proportion.  There are no carved out markings where the diamonds and precious were supposed to have been embedded. A visitor is only allowed three hours to finish the visit. Depending on the time of the year you visit,  you might get a heavy shrouded Taj Mahal.  Keep the shoe covers if you are going to visit the Baby Taj. This is because the visit to the Baby Taj also requires visitors to remove foot ware."
Impressive but visit on a clear day,"This is my second time visiting Taj Mahal. The first time, I was a kid and the day was clear and sunny. That was impressive and beautiful. This time it was a winter day, foggy and cold. So, the full glory of the Taj Mahal was not revealed. So, if you can, do not go to Taj Mahal in a foggy, winter day!To enjoy the monument at your own pace, it is better to download an audio guide, which contains much more reliable information than the tourist guides near the monument. Also, there is a time limit of 3 hours of visiting the monument."
Absolutely wonderful.,Words cannot describe how fabulous this monument is and photographs do not really do it justice. The first glimpse we had through the arch was breathtaking.It was extremely crowded however when we arrived in the middle of the afternoon and the traffic was so heavy that the we didn’t make it to the other side of the river to catch the sunset which was disappointing. Do give yourself enough time to allow for the traffic at that time. I would recommend going for sunrise as the changing light was magical and there were fewer crowds. Due to the visit and iconic photo of Diana it’s almost impossible to get that photo unless you pay one of the many photographers gathering there. Even if you are prepared to pay the crowds waiting make it a lengthy process.
World Known Place,It is a world-known Place and famous for its architectural work. I did visit this place where I remained awestruck. This place is worth seeing and moreover famous for its glory all over the world.
.Beautiful ,Travelled a short distance by bus then you go in a  jeep to the entrance.You then walk to the gated entrance where you can see the Taj Mahal. We were there at sunrise do not too busy. It is was running as expected and a photographer's dream.As uou get nearer you can see the ornate carvings etc.You have to put plastic shoes on to go inside.There are good toilet facilities at the entrance.Well worth the visit
This should be on your bucket list,"well everybody loves a love story and that what youll find here, an absolute must do and go back in the morning at day break, the pink hue on the side of the Taj is spectacular. pay the extra 200rp and go into the main hall, its worth it"
Waha Taj,"Unbelievable experience with lot of cultural and unique monument of love which one can feel, a true story of love"
Breathtaking,"We had a tour guide who helped us appreciate the sheer beauty of the Taj. You will not be disappointed the craftsmanship is second to none, the skills and patience required no longer exist."
Fascinating,Very very beautiful! Stunning constructure and incredible design.  The area is very clean and pictures taken will be very nice especially if sunny (even if your camera is not very good as in my case). I would recommend click your own picture as they can charge quite a lot for it. You'll be given water when entering the area and if you wish to go inside (you definitely should) you need to wear shoe covers.
"Second visit, just as breathtaking ","Absolutely breathtaking. This was my second visit to the Taj Mahal, the first was more than 12 years ago, and I was just as much in awe of it this time as I was then. It’s a beautiful building with a beautiful story behind it and you really can’t visit India without making the trip to see this. The pictures we took of it were worth the money the cost of the trip alone."
"Amazing, stunning monument.....a must see if in India.","My wife and I visited the Taj Mahal as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February. We were scheduled to visit the Taj on a Friday morning for sunrise, but as the Taj Mahal is closed every Friday for local religious worship, our guide changed the schedule and we visited it for sunset the day before. Although initially disappointed with this decision, it turned out in our favour as the Friday morning was cloudy and foggy, but the Thursday afternoon when we visited was perfect with clear blue skies. Fortunately for us, our visit coincided with Donald Trump visiting, so everything had been cleaned.....the building, the grounds and the water features. Our guide said in his 200+ visits, he had never seen the Taj Mahal this clean. It was a great experience and the highlight of our trip. I would recommend paying the extra 200 Rupea and visiting the interior, where the tombs of the King and his third wife are located. This structure is truly an amazing wonder of the world and must see for everyone."
Must see at least once in your lifetime ,"Wow, wow, wow. Iconic and everything people say it is. Must be on everyone's bucket list. Don't worry about trying to see it at sunset if it is smoggy.  It just fades quietly into nightfall"
Classical must see,"We opt for the sunrise time and we could not do better. Yes, we had to wait in the queue for 20-30 minute, just because they opened a bit later, but worth the time to be there before the crowd.Around 8 there was much more people, and queues to the mausoleum were really long.Yes, this is a must see, but is really nice:)"
Wow! Simply stunning!,"Words can hardly do justice to this amazing monument - one of the few places I have been that fully deserves all the hype and superlatives given to it. We visited in the early morning, arriving just as the gates opened at dawn and were amazed at how relatively quiet it was. Yes, we did have to queue but not for long and the line was handled quickly and efficiently. (One tip - take as little as possible to avoid the bag search which can add considerably to how quickly one gets in). The site is so enormous that the crowd soon disperses and even at the famous 'Diana' bench there was only a comparitively short wait to get the 'perfect shot'.Our guide, Atiq, was superb - a fount of knowledge and able to guide us to the best vantage points, adding immeasurably to the experience. This is a truly beautiful building in wonderful gardens - an oasis of calm in a beautiful city and truly a 'wonder of the World'!"
amazing,"Fantastic. Contrary to many negative comments I heard, this placed was stunning, pristinely clean and not overrun with beggars ant hawkers. It truly is one of the wonders of the world."
Taj Mahal,"I now understand, why it's been on World 7 wonders list like forever. absolutely stunning & beautiful artwork."
"An amazing, beautiful building","A must see!What a beautiful, amazing and very busy site.  Peaceful despite being bust with people from all over the world.  Professional photographers on site to take your photo in front of the Taj.Able to explore the site and having been given directions by our guide, we were able to ensure we saw the major areas and also follow protocol of wearing shoe covers, which were provided, this meant we didn’t need to remove our shoes.A huge site, the beauty of which I cannot describe in words and the photos don’t really do it justice.Free toilets, okay by Indian standards.A must see and highly recommended."
A Great Monument,"The size, detail and magnificence of this symbol of love will always be felt even if you have visited many times.This is a great example of mogul architecture and the biggest building ever built our of love for a spouse, in the world.Always worth a visit."
Tajmahal tour,It’s really very good Symbol of love Tajmahal is pride of India I was so happy to visit there I would like to go again Thanks
A Monument to a Lost Love,"Mumtaj Mahal, the wife of the Emperor, Shah Jahan, was pregnant with their 14th child. She was 39 years old and knew that she would not survive her pregnancy. She extracted three promises from her husband. Firstly, he was never to re-marry. Secondly, he had to promise to care for their surviving children. Lastly, she wanted him to build a monument in her memory. Shah Jahan fulfilled all of his promises.After the death of Mumtaj Mahal, Shah Jahan imported artisans from as far away as Persia (today's Iran). 20,000 persons worked round the clock for 22 years to build what is universally considered one of the world's seven greatest wonders. The architecture of the place is wondrous. The craftsmanship, impeccable.No life is truly complete without a visit to marvelous place. The Taj Mahal is not open for viewing on Fridays. Plan accordingly."
"Taj Mahal India, Best place to see","Amazing experience, to avoid rush and que visit early morning , entry fee is 50 rupees for Indians , best place"
Beautiful Taj Mahal,The Taj Mahal is a beautiful serene place that is a must visit in Agra.  Early mornings or late afternoons is best to visit as it can get crowded otherwise.  Definitely get tickets online before hand to avoid ticket lines.  Make sure you get the inside tour tickets as you want to see if from the inside.  Just sit in awe of the beauty of this temple.
Well worth the travel to Agra.,"Despite my terrible experience at the Taj Haveli hotel, seeing the Taj Mahal was well worth the trip to Agra. Friends in India, said it could be skipped, but I'm glad I fit it in. Such an incredibly imposing monument that sheds such awe."
Terrific Taj!,One of the seven wonders of the world the Taj Mahal doesn't disappoint. It's architecture is breathtaking and fascinating. Obvious crowds are attracted to this icon   and patience is required to navigate this tourist hotspot. Not to be missed!
TAJ WITH AMIT JHA,"|Of course the Taj Mahal will blow your mind. of course it is so extraordinary that you stand breathless before it, of course the story of love that it represents will make you wish for your own devoted lover and cry for the loss of loved ones. Of course.But for all the inevitability of it it still is the most EXTRAORDINARY building and you must must see it if you can.I had the great privilege of seeing the Taj Mahal both at sunset and dawn with friends, under the expert guidance of wonder guide AMIT JHA.Do yourself a favour and find this fellow , either via f/b AmazingTaj or through India Personal Tours. He's intelligent and relaxed, takes great photos and finds unexpected ways to show the wonders of this beautiful place."
7 wonders,"Awesome experience, everone in there life time should visit this place. Very pleasant and wondeful place"
Corruption at East Gate. Be Aware.,"We were a group of 13 visiting on the 4th of March. We entered at 15h. When leaving at 18h, on the 3h time frame we were told at the same gate that we had exceed the 3h time frame and forced to pay extra 600 INR to exit. No receipt. No intervention from the Police. Shame on you Agra. When corruption gets to the symbol of a nation something must be very wrong."
Taj Mahal,"Great tourist attraction.Take cash as eftpos unreliable.A wonderful experience if only they had tap and go.History in every inch, get a registered government guide for a reasonable price to make the trip a  complete history lesson as their story telling is well researched.Beautiful art work and history.Early morning visit in the cool was a good decision.Take water with you as its a bit of exercise for seniors but all flat no climbing,and hydration a must along the way."
A symbol of love,"A stunning mausoleum, monument and symbol of love build right next to the Yamuna River in Agra.This monument has it all, the beautiful story of an emperor that loved his (3rd) wife so much he build her this amazing mausoleum and the actual architecture of one of the most symmetrical buildings in the world.If you look really closely, the four pillars are tilted outwards rather than standing straight. The reason why it was constructed that way was to protect the main tomb from being damaged in case of any natural calamity like an earthquake. In that case the pillars would fall outwards.Shah Jahan ended up burying his wife in the middle of the beautiful structure and later him self. His servants and other wife’s were also buried in the complex outside the actual mausoleum.The entrance fee (as a western tourist) is ₹1300 and includes a bottle of water, shoe covers and the right to enter both the complex and the mausoleum."
One of the Seven Wonders,"Spend time to take in all the buildings and things to see. The crowds can be a little overwhelming, but the details are well worth taking your time to admire the work that went into these beautiful sights."
Wow,"This place is amazing and definitely worth a visit.  If you are a foreign tourist it costs INR 1300 but included in that is a bottle of water, shoe covers and a guide.  Our guide was out of this world and along with telling us all about the taj he took numerous almost professional photos with our camera.  Please do not miss this spectacular building"
Just note off caution,"Taj Mahal is a must visit and agra too, you won't be disappointed at all, even thou there are loads off people it's still not crowded.if you have a guide get them firstly to take you to the park on the other side off the river first, here you can see the taj Mahal from the other side.secondly if you take an official photographer inside the taj tell them the number off photos you want ie 20 or 30 or 60, the more you have taken the more you pay for they are £1 a photo.so saw I only want 20 photos plz, just a tip so you dont get stung"
Brilliant Attraction!,The attraction can be made even more special by downloading the izi.TRAVEL/app on your android or iOS and relish the tour guide experience of the next level
Amazing experience,Tis was my 2nd trip to Taj Mahal and equally good as previous one.I found quite some good amount cleanliness and maintenance work done by the authorities.I found one thing different is to charge Rs 200 extra for the Taj mahal itself. Earlier this was not charged separately.
Exquisite,"Early morning, before the crowds, is possibly the best time to visit, catching the light of the rising sun as it hits the eastern side of this mausoleum. A testament to one man's love for his (favourite) wife, this gleaming white marble edifice, inlaid with semi-precious stones, stands majestically in immaculate, symmetrical gardens and is the highlight of any trip to India."
Just incredible ,"So after two and a bit decades of marriage my hubby and I made it to the Taj. And what a beautiful moment we had. Such a splendid endeavor rooted in love. And the craftsmanship of the building, the ambition of the design. It was beyond my expectations and the sentiment of love was a joy. It may have been busy but the sunrise and the emotions were wonderful. Don't miss this if you are in India."
Words fail me ...,"A visit to the Taj Mahal was part of the itinerary on my recent tour of India.  I was happy to go along with it as it's one of the Seven Wonders of the World after all.  I was simply unprepared for the beauty and tranquility of the place in spite of the crowd of visitors there.  You enter through a gate and this is the first glimpse you have of the monument close up.  It appears on the horizon and takes your breath away.  And then, of course, there's the photo on the 'Diana bench'.  Make of that what you will.  All in all I would thoroughly recommend that you visit."
We've visited India now we have seen the Taj Mahal,"We visited the Taj Mahal with our excellent guide Kogesh at 3pm.The whole approach is an exciting buzz of tourist industry with the streets packed with vendors selling the inevitable souvenirs. Once inside the grounds, designed in the  Islamic  style of 4 gardens with a central passage of water  you are met with an overwhelming  sense of beauty and peace, even though it is packed.This view and feeling is the part you will remember.Inside the Taj the fixed route past the tombs  shows the incredible beauty of the intricate designs.It is a moving experience. The following evening we visited  the gardens of Mahtab Bagh to view the Taj from across the river.  This gives a less crowed view of this beautiful building."
In awe of its beauty,"We got there just after sunrise. I'd highly recommend this as it was still busy but not overwhelming.You can't take your eyes off it, just beautiful to look at.You'll only be inside for about 5 minutes, but the beauty of it lies looking at the outside, the other buildings surrounding it."
One of the bucket list,We had our visit the day before Donald Trump arrived so the Taj Mahal was looking at its best and to be fair they were trying to clean up Agra as best as they could.If you can - GO EARLY before the bulk of the visitors arrive as its the only way you will get pictures that do the place justice.Don't bother with the gardens on the other side of the river.Beware of the token beggars and hawkers as you leave the site but a polite 'no' usually works.
Wow,"Just WOW! We booked this holiday a year ago and have looked forward to seeing the Taj ever since. It was amazing, everything we had imagined and more! What a love story. If you get chance, nearb is a theatre to watch the drama of the story of the Taj - well worth a visit to get the background of this amazing monument. Maybe I'll never see this again - but will remember forever."
Unique!,My second visit here after a space of 25 years. Absolutely stunning. Gardens were immaculate- perhaps after Donald Trumps visit earlier this week! Note it is shut on Fridays. An absolute must see!
Taj Mahal is The Best Place to Visit in Agra,There is no dearth of tourist places in Agra.Agra is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in Uttar Pradesh. Taj Mahal is an important place in Agra where every year a large number of tourists come from all over the country and abroad.Our experience of visiting Agra was very pleasing. We left the hotel for the Taj Mahal at 8 in the morning and we spent 2 hours visiting the Taj Mahal and its nearby places.The Taj Mahal Opening and Closing Time is - Daytime: sunrise to sunset every day (06:00 am to 06:30 pm) except Friday. Every Friday the Taj Mahal is closed and only accessible in the afternoon for Muslims to attend prayers. Nighttime: 08:30 pm to 12:30 am.
Classic check in point in India should never miss,"Magnificent but elegant Islamic style building, a tourist destination should never miss while visiting India. To most tourists, the main attraction of this place is the building itself, and it will takes you a long time taking pictures everywhere."
Absolutely well worth a visit,"A fantastic experience, only ruined by amount of so called guides & so called official photographers. It’s unfortunate that we have to pay 10 times the amount in entrance money than Indian people, we were also caught out BY THE NEW RULE THAT IF YOU ARE THERE LONGER THAN 3 HOURS YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY AN EXTRA 600 RUPEES PER PERSON. If you have plenty of time to spare take a rickshaw from Agra Cant railway station to the Taj Mahal fare very cheap. Be prepared to haggle for souvenirs in the local shops & for a souvenir booklet. Would recommend the train journey from New Delhi to Agra on the Gatiman express, it’s approximately 1 1/2 hours in air conditioned coaches, but book in advance & you can do this online with Indian railways, leaves New Delhi at 8.05am & leaves Agra at 17.55pm."
What An Experience. Amazing!,"This wonder of the world must be seen to be believed, it requires a long journey to get there but oh so worth it.We arrived just on sunrise and yes you will be harassed to buy trinkets from the many many locals trying to earn a living but we were advised not to say no as that means “maybe” and do not make eye contact. Believe me if you buy from one you will then have another twenty hassle you.Everything was worth seeing the Taj Mahal, an experience you will never forget.I highly recommend getting a good English speaking guide as their is so much to learn about the Taj Mahal and you will miss out on so much and not know what your looking at without a guide, this is my top tip.Our guide which was organised through our personal tour was a local man who has a Masters degree in History and there was nothing he didn’t know and to make things better he was an exceptional photographer, he knew all the tricks to getting lifelong photos on your camera."
"A must see, but expect crowds",WonderfulA must seeMake sure you know where the toilets areNo photos or videos allowed insideCertainly a world wonder
wah TAJ!!,"Vistied for 3rd time , i love the art there speaks volumes abt the history . must visit place in India"
WOW,One word is all it takes to describe this beautiful lady WOW there is no another monument like this that captures your heart from the moment you see this beauty. Truely a day I will hold close to my heart forever.
The Symbol Of The Love,Taj Mahal is one the seven Wonders of the world. This place doesn't need a rating . It's a class of its own. Really nice  place to see.
Truly a Wonder,As always a spectacular experience. Just as delightful with or without a tour guide. Be sure to explore some of the areas outside just the front gate for beautiful pictures and take time to visit the museum for more information and enjoy the gardens.
Incredible monument,"imposing monument, truly original history and architecture, wonderful park, suggestive environment.  good organization for the personalized visit"
Qatar,Taj visit was one of the best ones I've experienced during my travel history.I't an amazing architecture. Mind blowing beauty
It's all about the Taj,"It's the Taj Mahal! First time visitors to India should see this. No matter how crowded, you'll never feel it's too crowded. The building is simply beautiful. You'll get amazing photos from any angle at any time of the day (We went for sundown and the colors were magnificent). And of course, all the haters at home will be jealous AF."
This is why you came,"If you can choose the day in advance, check the weather forecast and make sure it's a bright sunny day. It makes the difference between beuatiful and absolutely stunning."
It is a wonderful place.  Buying tickets is not as complicated as having read reviews before.,"It is a wonderful place.  Buying tickets is not as complicated as having read reviews before.After purchasing a pass The atmosphere is loose. Did not push in any way The people who come here are mostly foreign tourists. As for the Indian people, they seem friendly and smiling. The queues were not overtaken. Everyone waited for the queue. Orderly, not chaotic The weather and sunshine in early February are good. Not hot, not too cold, very comfortable. It was good to miss our KLOOK ticket reservation. No need for anyone to come as a guide, walk yourself, indulge yourself. The history is as good as you can remember."
Taj the Real wonder of the World!,This is the first time I have visited the Taj Mahal during the winter season. Its beauty is ineffable.
Revisiting after a very long time,"I’m not sure if I can add to the millions of comments made about this symbol of unending love. We were planning to go afternoon of our arrival in Agra and also early morning. Unfortunately, everything was closed due to Trump’s visit, so we went early in the morning. We had an official guide, who saw to tickets etc. The queues were long but well worth the visit. First glimpse takes your breath away."
Go hard or go home,"The Taj Mahal way way exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely stunning. It is quite raised up which I hadn’t appreciated so it is even more of a spectacle as you come through the entrance. I cried. It is truly stunning. get your trip right here as it is quite a highlight for most people and you need to see it the best way you can. Sorry Agra but there is nothing else to do except the fort, so don’t hang around. really, it’s a big place with not much to recommend it. See the Taj early morning and again from the other side of the river and then go! it’s closed on a Friday for worship. I would say go with a pre booked guide to get the best out of it, navigate the queues etc. the security is high and the bag search queue is a pain and very slow. there is lady and man queues for security. We hired a photographer to get the iconic shots and they moved people out of the way, little chance of getting key spots by yourself as the photographers are well used to this and make an informal queue system. We had plenty of time after this to see the place properly. You go inside as well and that is also amazing. from the other side of the river you go into a sort of orchard and you can sit on a wall and just stare at it, it’s gorgeous. the back is the same as the front so it’s a great view. The sun rises and sets to the side, so don’t get too focussed on this. I would suggest maybe going again if you are going to try for photos, so that you can just enjoy being there. In February it was t shirt weather, maybe a jumper first thing."
Truly amazing structure,"Well what a surprise that I give this monument 5 stars...if there is anything on TripAdvisor that genuinely is a 5 star experience then this is it. We originally had an early morning visit booked to see the sunrise but were advised by local travel company that early fog was spoiling the visit so we went in the late afternoon (thankyou Indian Panorama). The site is spectacular..much larger than I expected, magnificently white and co scaffolding at all on the main structure. Yes it was busy but the grounds are big enough to deal with the throng. The Taj is ethereal and truly a wonder of the world you just don't want to take your eyes off it."
True Wonder of the World!,An awesome beauty that has stood the test of centuries. A true offering to love though the air inside does envelope one with sadness! NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
Breathtaking visit,"So finally we have come to see this and oh boy, big WOW, massive gasp, breathtaking. Nothing I have ever seen compares to Taj Mahal after Kaaba (Mecca) as a mosque or holy place. Our G Adventure guide took us from our hotel at 04:55 hrs to arrive to Taj Mahal at 05:00, we were first in the queue, it was bit chilly on 24 February but it was worth it as the queue very quickly became extensive. Luckily couple of coffee shops opened at 5:30 just opposite the gate so we had coffee and cookies. The other reason for going that early is that so you can watch sun rise and again was really a picture to die for. The Diana bench was perfect photograph spot, you have to queue. Over 25,000 visitors every day. A place well well worth the visit."
Amazing place,I think the Taj Mahl is more magnificent in person than in pictures.  It is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.
Spectacular!,"Our 2nd visit to this wonderful Monument but 30 years apart.  Still as breathtaking as the first time we saw it.  It really is an amazing sight and one that if you're lucky enough to get to see it, you will never forget.  Simply awesome in every respect."
Wah Taj,"It is amazing, mind blowing and one of the greatest architectural masterpieces in the world. 'Wah Taj' naturally came out of our mouth when we saw it for the first time. We are definitely going to see it again whenever get a chance to visit Agra. Undoubtedly TAJ is a WONDER!!"
One of the 7 wonders of the world,"The Taj Mahal, which is the mausoleum of Shah Jahan's beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal and  is now universally known as a monument of love."
Must visit! Detailed review for photographers.,"Don't really need to say how beautiful the Taj really is. But I would say it feels like you are in a wallpaper. Be ready to deal with a lot of crowd though.For the cleanest and best experience, go here early morning. The timings are from sunrise to sunset but people get in line quite early. There is a separate line for Indians and non-Indians so be aware of that. We wasted a lot of time waiting in a line which we didn't really have to.There are golf carts taking you from the vehicle drop-off point to the entry gate, however if you want to walk it down, expect to walk for around 10-12 minutes depending upon your speed (1 km). The walkway is lined with shops on either sides and there is various places to buy yourself some things to remember Taj Mahal by. The entrance fee for Indians is INR 50, for foreigners INR 1100, and an additional INR 200 if you wanna visit the mausoleum as well. The tickets are valid for 3 hours and a strict security check follows. You may buy tickets online as well. Tips for photographers:1. Go there as early as you can2. Don't take tripods, they aren't allowed.3. Rush to the photo spots once you're inside to get the least amount of people in your frame. For the ones that still get into your frame, there's photoshop."
"Ethereal, magical, magnificent!!!","I visited the Taj Mahal 20 years ago and upon my recent 2nd trip, I wondered if I would be as mesmorized as I was the first time round. This time I was also taking my boyfriend who was seeing it for the first time so I was expectant and a little worried that I had over dramatised her impact. I needn't have worried, still she reveals herself to you in part as you walk through the entry gate and then WOW, my jaw hit the floor as did that of my boyfriend. It is a marvel, standing in all her glory, it is still the best architectural masterpiece I have ever seen. Perfectly symmetrical, built in ivory-white marble, this mausoleum is situated on the south bank of the Yamuna river. Take some time to walk around it and marvel at it the Taj in the different lights. Take a step back and you will see the beautiful parrots among the trees worshipping this little piece of heaven as if they know it is a famous monument that depicts love. This is a must visit, you will never forget this experience, it stays with you."
Just Amazing ... even in the rain,"We arrived late afternoon hoping to see a beautiful sunset over this magical monument. Unfortunately the heavens opened, we had thunder and lightning ... but even in those conditions you cannot fail to be overwhelmed by the size, beauty and symmetry of this beautiful monument to love. As the rain cleared we were able to see the change in shade of the white marble - just incredible. One interesting fact ... the minaretsare built slightly sloping outwards, in case they were ever to fall - then they would fall away from the monument. Breathtaking!!"
