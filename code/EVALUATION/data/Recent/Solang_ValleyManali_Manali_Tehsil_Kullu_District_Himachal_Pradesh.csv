snowy experience,I have visited Solang valley 3 times. Each time its scenic beauty appears more attractive.  The route is definitely narrow and keeps you on the edge. One must not take very young children with them as they may have breathing issues. Also its important to check local weather conditions. One may come across traffic jams and that can be very irritating.  This usually happens during the vacations when there are more visitors. We as visitors should try to not spoil the beauty of this place . Maggi is a must
Memorable experience,"It was a memorable experience at the Valley since we enjoyed doing multiple activities. The weather, the view, the everything was beautiful."
we Hire taxi Alto for Rs 3000/- for 3 Days for All local Sights seen inclulding solang vally and manikaran .,its awesome......i hv just visited in Mar 2020...with full of snow. we Hire taxi Alto for Rs 3000/- for 3 Days for All local Sights seen inclulding solang vally and manikaran .
Solang Valley ! ,"Solang valley,Manali one of the bestest and memorable trip of my life.I wasn't sure whether I will actually enjoy the trip or not cos of the weather. The Hidimba temple,The Vashisht temple(hot water spring) popularly know as magic of nature. Then Solang valley covered with snowy mountains.Temperature which falls to -12°C.A small water flow give place heaven like look,a favourite for adventure enthusiasts, Parachuting to paragliding, horse riding to driving mini open jeeps specially available for tourists of all age groups, Paragliding is open for children also..Himalayan's costume dress is available for rent and people wear this and take photographs.Best time to visit: Winter❄⛄Note: Carry woollen clothes, caps, gloves, proper shoes."
The most sought after location in Manali in snowfall,"This is one of the most visited location in Manali, especially during or after the snowfall. This place offers brilliant snow experience including activities like paragliding, snow skiing, ice skating. You can also experience a short trip via the rope way. There are multiple stalls for food during peak season. Best season is post snowfall, i.e. Jan to Mar.The rates are also high during peak season and need negotiation skills. Also be prepared for long walks from the parking lot due to heavy traffic jams near the place. But, overall it is definitely a must visit place. It can be visited in half a day. There are taxi as well as bus services available from Manali to Solang. When we visited it, there was no snow as the snowfall got delayed that year, but we still enjoyed beautiful pine trees and the mountain peaks surrounding the valley."
GOOD SURROUNDINGS AND WINTER ACTIVITIES,"A must visit place for a day sightseeing from Manali, Can be planned for a day for activities specially in winter . Gondola ride is bit memorable for everyone to feel the surrounding on the way to top. Gondola station nearby places are best for photo shoot."
For activities ,"It's a nice place and affordable prices.There are different kind of activities like snow slides, paragliding and other activities."
Good place to have a day out from Manali,Visited this place on public transport which is available from Manali Bus Stand. Very limited services but great timings. Enjoyed Solang by tracking with friends  and loved this place
Tripping,No words to explain this amazing place overwhelmed with snow.This is the most wonderful and beautiful place in Himachal Pradesh.we will get a different experience with snow
Amazing,"Amazing place to experience snow, we experienced snowfall also. The gondola ride to highest peak is 600/- person both ways, gondola ride is highly recommended for it gives amazing view also u get to go on the top and experience fresh snow. The other activities are also quite fun. We went in March 1st week. The zip line, tyre fall, bunjee jump are all budget friendly and fun."
A must visit snow place in Manali,"As we visited this place in December, It was very cold and snow all around. It was the first time we were experiencing snow. It felt amazing. When we reach the place the people there attack you to take clothes from their stall, take shoes from them, take activity packages, etc.They also have food stall there which offers maggi, Paratha, etc.As it was the starting of winters and snow, the package was starting to be a little bit expensive.We choose a package where we got ATV ride to the top, Tube Ride, Skatting and Zip Line.Zip line is something must to be done there because it feels so good. Also they have photographers there who click pictures for 50-100 each. st time we were experiencing snow. It felt amazing.

The heart of Manali lies here at Solang Valley.,"Solang valley melts your heart. It is one of the most gorgeous and adventurous places to visit in Manali.  I was a bit unhappy because at this moment Rhotang pass was closed for visit. But visiting Solang Valley cheered me up. Luckily there was fresh snowfall and the whole place was appearing like Paradise. I am a calm admirer of nature and I had the best time of my trip to Manali, at Solang Valley. Here the snow graces you with its breathtaking beauty and every place had experienced fresh snow which transformed the valley  into a white snowy spread of absolute delight. Ropeway was exciting and we enjoyed playing in deep snow on reaching at the top. Overall it was a nice experience and if you are planning to visit Manali in the period when Rohtang pass is yet to open then Solang valley will surety make your trip worthwhile.."
Scintillating place,One of the most amazing places to have fun and scenic place too. Skying snow mobile paragliding  tube diving all in one place fun and adventurous place
"Zero for skiing, otherwise decent place for family fun","I'm a bit split while writing this review. I went there to check out the skiing and was thoroughly disappointed. The ski shop and one available lift was closed for no reason so couldn't rent any skis for the day. The ""ski instructors"" were offering ""lessons"" on a flat meadow which included pushing folks from behind. When I asked them about renting their skis, they said they'd charge Rs. 2000. Even the ropeway day pass was Rs. 2000 and they wouldn't let me carry skis saying it's too dangerous. So all in all, this is not a place to go to if you want to ski/snowboard.On the other hand, there are many activities to be had there esp if you're a family and simply want to enjoy snow. Be sure to bargain for deals. The flip side is that these activities take a toll on the environment and the garbage accumulated around here is an eyesore.So in a nutshell, absolutely avoid this place if your intention is to go skiing. If you with family and kids, this is a decent place to visit."
Must Go!,"Great place to enjoy snow to its fullest , with various activities happening all around. You must and must take the snow jumpsuits and gumboots which are available on the roadside before you climb up the valley. It really helps. There are 20-30shops selling the same, and you do have great variety available in various colors and sizes.You can take the ATV ride uo o the valley and to get you down as the walk up and down may be tiring and risky, as the road gets slippery bcoz of frozen ice and snow. And if you are really an adventure junkey, then you can run up and enjoy! :)They have small places serving maggi and chai, water and juices, sweet corn, laid up around the snow with tables and chairs for a quick bite."
Extremely commercialized!,"As much as I love snow and snowfall, I hate when people don't appreciate the beauty of it and make the place dirty instead. Solang Valley used to be a quiet peaceful place a few years ago. Now at every corner, there is a food stall. Where there is a food stall, there are more people. The road to Solang always has a traffic jam, and to top it all off, even when you reach Solang, there are these mini jeeps kinda vehicles that run on snow to take people to the top. The result is snow getting dirty, no proper place to walk, dangerous for the people who are walking. If you want to enjoy Solang Valley, when you reach to the top, just walk a little further from the Atal Bihari Mountaineering Hostel. The place is calm and chill and has the best view."
Switzerland week in India!,"This place really reminded me of our Switzerland family trip. It was on 27th December, 2019 and the entire place was covered with complete snow....Must do...-Hire your own car (better)-Get special dress, shoes and socks to protect that WINTER!-Get ready for 3/4 hours to be on road during peak season considering the number of vehicles/tourists visiting this place-Keep some dry food/water along with you-Have immense patience-Complete all your toilet related activities before boarding your car (as the toilet there was simply filthy (we being typical Indians)-Enjoy the snow scooter, the tyre skid, the para gliding and the Rope way, all in one place-Must start by 8 AM to have maximum time-Varieties of snacks available (not very expensive; manageable)Don't......-Stay safe from hell lot of agents (promising moon)-No need to get any help-Ask your car driver to drop you at the valley (in many cases, the driver will drop you at the lower level and you may not feel great)-Car parking is a SEVERE challenge-Don't stay beyond 4PM, you may again get stuck on road for 3/4 hours"
Beautiful beautiful beautiful,"So my car was parked mid way to the base where all the activities are conducted. On the way up I was offered to rent out jumper jackets and boots which I refused. I my opinion you should either wear shoes that can grip on ice or simply buy the boots. Jacket wasn't needed at all. Unless you intend to roll over the snow. Which would make your clothes wet. Walking up 4 wheeler motors were offered which again I refused and honestly you wouldn't really need it no matter who says what. It's a joy ride for sure but then that's about it. Do mind that the road leading up is practically a 2 narrow lane road so you would share the path with vehicles. And some parts of the road can get slippery. Watch out for it.On the way there is a Naag mandir. Do visit it.Once you get up there, enjoy all the activities and food. There is an ATM too up there right in the building that has ropeway. When I went it wasn't working though.Now if you want to really experience lesser crowd and more of scenics ... Take ropeway to the next level. They charge 650/- for the ride. Might sound too much but that's what deters most from going up and hence more secluded. What is expect up there is snow, snow, snow and some more snow. Best view I've seen! Snow clad mountains just made my pictures look wonderful.Keep one thing in mind please. These places are good as long as we visitors keep it. I found thrash over there and was disheartened! Did my bit of picking some idiots thrash to protect the place."
Frozen beauty with awespiring visuals,"I am also one of those tourists who came across this gem of nature's beauty while googling for snow places in India. I am detailing all the details of my experience of this place How to reach?a) Once you reach manali , solang valley is approx. 10 km from manali centre. b) From shimla its approx. 8 hours journeyc) From chandigarh its approx. 9 hours journeyIs this the only snow place?Though you see some small snow filled places all along ( typically set by resorts / private land owners to attract tourists) . Solang valley is the actual snow point on top of the peak. Do not fall in trap of any tourism operators of they show a patch of land with snow as snow point. Like the bane suggests solang valley is a vast landscape  with snow.What do we need to prepare for before going?a) Remember the place is at high altitude,unless you have any breathing ailments it's safe to travel and have fun there.b) you need to wear snow gear to avoid drenching your clothes and shoes. If you have it well and good and if you dont you can rent the whole set up ( dress and boots) for 250 rs and not a penny more. Gloves,mufflers, and socks will be charged extra c) you easily get dehydrated so keep your self hydrated ( you get water bottles and cool drinks all along)What activities can we do?a) you have zipline (500)b) Quad bike (500 to 800)c) Yak ride(300 to 500)d) skiing ( unless you want to take photo dont go for it as its lot of time waste with balancing, and falling down)e) Para gliding (really exciting costs upto 3000)Make sure you bargain When is the best time to goOct end till Feb end will be the ideal time"
Good Valley,We visited this place at the time our stay at Manali.This is the one of the attraction surrounded in Manali.At the time of visiting this place we have facing rain so we are unable to doing any activity.
Local sightseeing in Manali,"One of the best place in Manali for adventure lover. All kinds of sports activities like paragliding, skiing is done here."
A paradise for adventure activities,"This popular and touristy place is a paradise for adventure enthusiasts. Paragliding, skiing, zorbing. They have everything. If you wanna avoid crowd don't come here."
Awesome snow covered region surrounonded by beautiful mountains!!,"This place is one of the most sought place for all tourists visiting manali and it offers various activities such as zipline,atv ride,skiing,paragliding,etc.One needs a car or gypsy to go to solang valley from manali as buses don't ply in this route frequently!!. This is one of the best places to visit in your manali trip and you won't regret visiting here as this place is awesome to the core!!!"
Solang the destination of just married,Its been a wonderful site with only NATURE to see and Absorb. Instills oxygen and energy in you. With newly wed couple around its felt all new and fresh there. while travelling on timber trail to the top you just become witness to worlds biggest trees around and WHITE SNOW (in winter)
Amazing place,"We were lucky to get to this place when no personal or two wheel drive vehicles were allowed here. So, not much crowd. That was the best part. It was like heaven on earth. Covered with snow mountains from all sides, it was really awesome. Enjoyed the snow sports. One must take the gandola to go to the top. View from top is breathtaking."
"Solang Valley, a beautiful place near to Manali","Visited this beautiful place with friends. Solang valley is away 12-14 km form Manali. In cold season, there is shop to buy a cloth for protection against snowfall. Charges are normal for cloth. There is a large parking area for vehicle. Base camp main food is Maggi and Hot tea/coffee. There is not more option for food. Moter Byke is available there for darshan of Shivlling at top of hill. Shivling is just under the waterfall. View of that combination is great (Water fall & Shivling). Charge for Byke is also normal. Byke ride is awesome. Zipline, paragliding (3000-4000Rs), Byking, all activities are available there to enjoy."
Excellent place except for terrible traffic,"Lovely place to visit in December. completely covered in snow. Breathtaking landscape,  several snow activities, including Skiing, sledging, para gliding and tube slides, though some seems a bit more dangerous on a crowded day with low level of supervision. Take a cable car to the mountain top which is bit expensive but one can capture some beautiful pictures away from the crowds. The road to the valley from Manali town is narrow as one goes up, and on the day before the Christmas  we experienced 4 hours in terrible traffic each way. Parking is disorganized closer to the valley. in such a situation better to take a snow scooter ride which will take you to the top through short cuts. Horse ride is another option. perhaps ride a yak ? dont forget to clad yourself with a snow suit, which one can hire from many shops on the road to the valley.Though we do not know how clean or hygenic they are after being used several times.Warm clothing and shoes to walk on snow is a must as the temperatures are minus 7-8. The only cafe at the bottom of cable car serves classy hot food and drinks and a resting place for seniors till the young ones take part in adventurous activities.I wish the Manali City authorities will arrange for disciplined vehicle parking areas before the highest point and arrange shuttle service to avoid unnecessary long traffic blocks which spoils the fun."
Excellent place - what to do and how to reach,"Solang is a great place from main Manali around 13-15 Km. This is where the main snow activities take place in the winter or colder months when Rothang, Marhi etc. is cut off. In the way comes Nehru Kund which may also have snow in Jan, Feb, March and good for a short stopover. 3-4 hours can be spent in Solang doing snow activities and good time pass. If you're going as a couple you may be offered a package of snow activities on reaching which may well be more affordable as you may get to do skiing, snow bike, tire tube sled , zip lining etc. for a fixed price. But here also negotiate to get the best price.  Snow shoes (gum boots) are advisable to rent. Perhaps even the dungree / full set - on the way itself, if it is snowingTaxis from Manali to here are expensive so do check if there are HPTDC tours ongoing and these may be well cheaper and more systematic.Best activity i liked there was the most inexpensive one too - mere 10 bucks for  a wooden makeshift sled being provided on rent by local kids ! Good food options with tea, coffee there run by local cafes . A request to everyone to stop anyone from LITTERING as we found people had even spread some litter in this beautiful place despite their being dustbins nearby"
Excellent place for activities,"Very cheerful place with lots of activities and fun. From Snowbikes, Gandloa ride, Para gliding to skiing, all are fun. Just be careful while negotiating the prices. You would get better prices on spot rather than through some 3rd party or on road."
Valley covered with snow on 1st Jan 2020,We visited Solang valley in the new year and when we visited the valley it was covered with snow we enjoyed for 02 hours during that I suggest visiting the valley after it had fresh snowfall so u can enjoy the snow if u have not enjoyed earlier
Amazing Place,We enjoyed the Cable Car.....it is worth going to the peak for snow fun. The tickets for cable car is INR 650 for both the ways.
Highly overpriced,"We left our hotel around 10.30 with kids to see snow n do snow activities in solang. Biggest mistake, got stuck in jam for 4 hours reached at snow activity place (which is actually very small) at 3.30 and sun sets at 5.30, snow has gone all black due to so much foot fall. Also when u take ur special snow dresses on rent shopkeepers will try to convince you to pay price n book all the activities in advance there only at their shop. Never do that. Paid 5000 for a 500 snow bike ride and since we had already paid advance we can not turn back our cars and have to visit the activity location.Visit places on way to rohtang in winters instead of solang.for better snow n beautiful n peaceful time."
Winter festival,"Solleng Valley Winter festival mostly after first layer of snow in last week of Dec to jan mid. Area is flocked with tourists from all locations to embrace awe of snow and snow games. Yak ride, paragliding, skating, mountain bike, snow slide are few things this place is famous for."
Great place,"Enjoyed being here. Offers a wide range of activities like skiing, ziplines and even paragliding.Has quiet areas to relax too"
"Mesmerizing views, but beware of money looters","We visited Solang valley on 29th Dec. The climate was good. Sun was out and valley was covered with snow. We reached around 11 Am and spent around 4 hours there. It started getting cold around 3 PM, so advice is to reach there early. You can get stuck in bad traffic in the noon.Coming to cons.. we were advised by our cab driver to book package and pick clothes from the counters on the way. Please don't book packages there. They simply fool the tourists. They kept saying the rates are from the union and didn't allow any negotiation. Snow biking track was very short and not worth the money. Skiing guide hardly helped us to ski for 5 min, but package dealer said it's unlimited.Kids enjoyed playing with snow on their own. There is so much to explore near the river bed as well.Overall an unforgettable experience. Completely worth it!"
Solang valley trip (Manali) Dec 27-2019,"We visited Solang  valley on the second day of our Manali trip . Solang valley is about 13 kms from Manali town and can be reached in 30 minutes if trip is planned early about 8 am during peak tourist seasons . Roads are narrow and can expect 3-4 km long traffic jams when you return from there or if started late in the afternoon . Not enough parking space available there .Vehicles parked on the road sides and coming in the wrong direction can create a complete mess . Not enough traffic police personnel available on roads to regulate traffic . Don't opt  for trip packages offered by road side shops(plenty of them available in the route )  as the prices are not fixed and they may cheat you .  What you need to have to go for snow area ( if the sky is clear and snow is present in mountains) , are snow suits ( may cost only 250-300 Rs per person ) , Rubber boots , gloves made of  water proof materials and the thermals and jackets normally used to wear in hill stations . Goggles are not required . Don't opt for packages which includes skating , rubber tube slide, zip line etc and guide. Many of these activities can be enjoyed directly paying at the spot at much lesser rate and guide is of no use,  as there is nothing to travel around and see with the help of a guide .When we visited Solang valley days were sunny and the valley was filled with fresh snow . Place is good for a 5-6 hr trip and very beautiful during snow season  . A small stream flowing through the valley adds charm to the scenic beauty of the region .In my opinion skiing was not very enjoyable as there were too many people in a small patch of space. Skiing is not something that can be learned in few minutes neither the so called ""guides""  adept at teaching tourists. Most of the time, tourists were bumping into each other and falling over.Starting your onward trip to Solang post noon can spoil your plan as we saw kilometers long traffic jam towards Solang valley while we were returning from there. Our driver had parked much below the tourist drop point in Solang valley to avoid traffic, On our return, we had to walk thru' slippery slushy snow slopes filled with horse dung for ~ 2km. This trek can prove difficult for some.Many vendors selling Maggi , Bread toast , Hot tea/coffee are available there and provide good and cheap option during travel ."
Solang Trip 2019,"Snow Clad Himalayas all around and a truly divine feel. what more can one say as we visited just a day after fresh snowfall on 22nd Dec'19. This is the gateway to all adventures trip if one is also interested in sports like Skieing, Paragliding and Horse rides on snow clad and beautiful Himalayas"
Heaven on Earth!,"Never saw such a beautiful place before. I along with my family visited it on Dec 17, 2019. My car driver warned that we could visit it only if weather permits. Fortunately weather was excellent on that day. We wanted to go as early as possible while weather was good, but our car driver said nothing would be open before 9 AM. Further, our hotel could not provide breakfast before 8:30 AM! Finally left the hotel premises only just before 10 AM. Then vehicle had to wait for quite a lot of time along the way to the valley as one need to give way some-times for on-coming vehicles. Not only this, it took quite some time to reach the valley due to a patch of slippery section of the road. Due to ice on the road, many vehicles had difficulty in moving forward. We encountered many mountain bikes zipping along the road. Finally, we could reach the valley only at about 12:30 PM. First we tried skiing in a small flat area. There were many people but not too many fortunately. We also enjoyed snowmobile as well. Then we went about hundred meters down the valley where we tried zipline which went down over a river for about hundred meters. The place where the drive ended was simply superb! The entire are was covered with snow a few days ago with a few trees here and there and in between a stream of Beas river. There was quite lot of sun when we reached the valley. It was not cold at all. Many people removed warm clothes to avoid sweat. Played quite some time in the snow. Got many photographs taken by our guide who had DSLR camera. In fact he suggested us various poses for photographs. He said he had snow filter to get very nice pictures and they were so. The place was totally in snow and was extremely beautiful with Solang village at the far end on a slope of a mountain. There was zorbing activity and sliding activity on a tyre tube, but we did not choose to do none of them  as we already had tube slide done at Kufri near Shimla. If you did not have this ride before, I suggest you do at least the tube ride as the riding is better and longer than it is at Kufri. We did a ride on Yalks as well. No paragliding activity was available probably due to presence of snow. After spending about two and half hours we ate noodles and had tea. There were quite a few shops providing lunch in the valley. Toward end of our time at the valley, i.e., at about 3 PM, Sun started disappearing due to clouds and cold weather started. By the time we reached our hotel it was about 4:30 PM. You need to allocate a day for the Solang valley visit.Notes:- 1) Our taxi stopped at Bahang and the taxi driver said his vehicle would not come to Solang valley as we need 4 wheel drive vehicle due to existing snow on the road. He took us to a shop and had to go through agent who supplied snow boots, warm clothing and gloves, etc. The agent also supplied a guide and a jeep as well. Paid for a few rides at this agent itself.  But on the way we found a few regular cars as well!2) The jeep took us to the Solang valley and waited till we finished our activities. 3) The guide was exclusively meant for us. He took us to various places of activities and helped us doing them.4) The guide also offered service of taking photographs using his own DSLR camera for a price. We found this service quite useful. Of course you can always take photos with your own phone or camera. 5) I suggest you keep couple of pairs of extra socks with you as we found our socks got wet some how at the end of our visit."
Snow valley,"Solang valley reach to very traffic in season period..heavy traffic get irritate ... surrounding the hills and views will forgot the time ...Who are willing adventure and fun will definitely like it...Still need lot of improvement like parking ,basic like rest room and all.No need guide and all ..250 dresses. Given for rent including shoes ..If good driver he knows all places don't waste 2000 for guide .totally waste.Remain activities all lot of money asking ..If here snow is not  available going this place will get disappointed...Still government can initiate make do better. .."
Some tips,"Place is good, but chances of getting cheated are also very high. All rates are very much exorbitant. Start early from Manali, probably around 7:30am. If you are late past 8am then chances of reaching will be very late because of heavy traffic & huge traffic jams. Body warmers, sweaters, jackets, gloves & head cap is sufficient (which every tourist caries with during hilly tours). Simply no need to hire jackets from local shops. Taxi drivers & shop keepers will try to convince that you  are from plains & you cannot bear the cold; but believe me other than the rubber boots nothing is necessary. Just hire rubber boots only from the shops, even it is not compulsary that you have to take it from Manali only, you can take it once you reach Solang also; till that time you can understand the temp change and can decide what to take & what not. If anybody is planning to lie and roll around in the snow then please carry one windcheater so that your warm clothes didn't get wet. This experience is during peak winters 26 Dec'19 (in summers nothing is needed), follow the same suggestion for Rotang pass during summers. I've seen many who spend nearly 1K - 2K on jackets,gloves,socks & shoes only to find them hanging over their neck laterwards or kept them inside cars.Always keep your belongings safe. Chances of losing mobiles, walets are very high once you are on bumpy rides in snow. Many a times during rides your belongings may fall from jacket pockets which you may not even feel."
Do not go during peak season,"We wasted an entire day sitting in the car and getting nowhere. Too many people, of which we are also the problem. Went at 10:30, reached halfway at 3 and turned back and returned to the hotel. Even later in the evening the road still seems to be jammed. If you want to enjoy snow and nothing else, better to book a property in the higher reaches, or visit outside of the holiday season."
Great fun but too crowded ,Get there early or the traffic becomes a nightmare!Activities were great. The snow tube was thrilling
Trip to Solang Valley,Very beautiful place with Snow capped Mountains.as usual as it is in India everyone must be careful from getting cheated by People who conduct Package Games. My experience never get into game packages even though your cab driver insist. You will get good cloths n shoes which will protect you from freezing cold for 200 to 250rs. Go to the play ground and then decide what you would to play and pay accordingly. But they accept only cash. If you book a package on pressurizing by your cab driver then you are royally screwed. At the hill top all food items are very coatly. So pls carry sufficient cash with you. Hotel guys also accept cards to swipe. But be careful to protect yourself with sufficient cloths. At the end you will definitely enjoy. One worst thing is Swacth Bharat is complelte failure here. Very bad and unigenic condition. For Ladies it will be worst condition. I strongly recommend to Himachal Pradesh Govt to take necessary action towards basic necessity like good free n higenic toilet and protect tourist from looting game arrangers who are completely private and it is a full loot. It is very good destination like Switzerland but as usual we Indian lack in arrangements and get into looking money. Shamefull.
It was very interesting and adventurous,There was a lifetime experience of ATV bike ridewe had a great thrilling experience of paraglidingit was too shady
Holiday,Whilst in Simla it had snowed overnight so we decided to go to Slong Valley as it is supposed to be really beautiful. However a 15 minutes journey took us about 2 hours. Traffic was at a stand still as people had parked their car everywhere not taking into consideration of the ongoing traffic. There was no traffic wardens around to guide the traffic. When we got there the scene was absolutely breathtaking. We got our had a snow fight and decided to head back just in case we get stuck again in traffic. Thanks fully it did not take us that long. The main thing is that we had a great time. X
Beautiful White Christmas Cool Snow,"Rent a jeep for 4.000 Rupee ( 6 people ). Borrow coats and boots 250 Rupee. Wear proper clothes to enjoy the snow. The pine tress - the snow fall - the thick snow - knock out your heart to joy and happiness 😍 Pick good minutes to be there.. snow fall will block the roads ! Very crowded on Dec, people in India have holidays ! The flights were cancelled due to bad weather, so we rent a car from Delhi. Took 14 hours driving 😔. 4.200 Rupee for 12 people, return trip. The driver stayed for 2 nights with us. What a wonderful christmas I have ever after...."
Best place to visit,"White white white everywhere white snow only 😍, if we stuck in traffic it takes 3hrs to move , i stuck in snow Strom but we enjoyed lot when we enjoyed lot in traffic"
The Beauty & and the Beast of Indian Alps,"Solang Valley is beautiful and just so much reminds of the Swiss Alps sans the chaos and running madness of vendors who actually harasses you to buy their services, whether you need or you do not need. Nestled in the Himalayas and so near to Manali, Solang Valley is just a treat to one’s tiring eyes from city life and to lot of us who loves all and everything about Snow! The best part is that you can actually do so many activities at Solang. Right from a ATV bike ride upto the Snow point ( they ask for INR  1200 per person but if you’re lucky then you can negotiate it for INR 900) to ride on the mules to travel on a rope way ( costs INR 650 per person) to skiing to paragliding to other games for children and adults. Everything is not worth unless you’re ready to throw away money. Best time to visit ? Ofcourse early to mid part of December since till then your car can go to the end point from where Solang Valley begins or else be ready to either walk up or ride an expensive ATV. The ride to ropeway is just amazing and a whole lot of fun with children. You can witness the majestic Solang Valley from top and that’s worth every penny. Cons ? Exorbitant costs of all activities and that I think should should be regulated by some Association or by the Government. Even the cost of a cup of coffee at the top is just too much unless you’re not worried at all. Pros ? The view of the majestic snow capped Himalayas and able to play with real Snows with your family and friends and silently appreciate the gorgeous view of the Nature!"
in Love with Snow,"if you have never seen snow ever the this place would serve as a great first timer ! with experienced guides and not to difficult terrain this place is amazing ! get yourself clicked and enjoy hot snacks amidst snow ! don't avoid ATV rides , its once in a lifetime experience"
Had fun,"Visited in December 2019, temperature was always close to 0.   Solong valley had little ice.  You can find shops selling packages for activities.  Better take a look at the activities before you pay.  Skiing tub ride and bike ride space was very small.  Space constraints were due to availability of snow.Choose snow fall season if you want more adventure activities."
Best place to enjoy wintersports,"Solang valley is best place to enjoy snow as well as the games associated. be it para gliding, Snow boarding or just throwing it. Overcrowded at times."
Adventureland,It was a great time but some of the things that were mentioned were not there such as ice skating and bungee jumping. We did paragliding and rode the ski lift up to the top and played in the snow. Did a bit of trekking on our own but typically they don’t encourage this as there are lots of wild animals in the mountains. Not really any place nice to chill and eat after a long day of winter sports. Beware the sellers of fake saffron!
Solang Valley,"When heading to Manali for a vacation, two absolutely essential destinations in the itinerary are Rohtang and Solang Valley. 14 kilometres to the north west of the main town of Manali, Solang Valley is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Himachal Pradesh. Situated on the way to Rohtang from Manali, every year the valley welcomes tourists in huge numbers. A favourite for adventure enthusiasts, parachuting to paragliding, horse riding to driving mini-open jeeps specially available for tourists of all age groups, Solang Valley has it all.During winters, Solang valley is covered with snowmaking skiing is a popular sport here, with training institutes and trainers located in the valley to supervise skiers and train beginners. As the snow melts, skiing is taken over by zorbing. Another popular attraction of Solang valley, taking advantage of the slopes of the valley, you are likely to spot a huge transparent ball with mostly two people inside it rolling down the slope during summers. Yes, Zorbing is as much fun as it looks like. One of the most vibrant and enjoyable places in Manali, there is no way one can possibly miss this amazing valley, while here."
Icy ,"You can see snow here . Solang valley is situated at 10 kms from mal road , manali . Views from here can definitely blow your minds."
Snowww,it's a nice experience hotel is very good and and its location is also good the staff of the hotels is also friendly meta Chetan thakur the manager is also familiar person the food of the hotel is very delicious and yes I will come again Manali Khushboo resorts
Amazing view of mountains,I visited Solange valley with my family and started my journey from kanyal road and on the way to valley I am totally amazed with the beauty of nature and also the mountains with snow looking awesome. In reaching valley I found little disappointed that's why I gave 4 rating instead of 5 as there's not so much to have fun in valley with family. Last time o visited manali 7 yrs back same time and at that time so much activities happening in valley and food served in valley also pathetic with no quality and taste. People can enjoy the distance travelled from manali to valley but in valley not so much to cherish the moment. There must a peoper sitting arrangement so that parents can watch there kids enjoying on ground and also govt must take initiative to make a valley more beautiful as beauty of nature still there.
High on Adventure,"It was a quick afternoons trip to Solang valley, small, picturesque and a lively place. For us the USP of this place was the Para gliding over the green valley with the snow covered mountains making a dazzling backdrop. The activity was through their association, a fixed price affair, with ski lifts to the launching pad, experienced pilots and a smooth exhilarating swoop down.       Besides the Paragliding we didnt really stop for much else  apart from a quick cup of tea."
A relaxing valley experience,"Me and my husband went to Solang Valley in November 2019 on our trip to Manali.Its about an hours drive from Manali and can be done on your way back from Rohtang or Gulaba Pass.There are a couple of activities one can do in Solang Valley. - The cable car ride to the top of the hill- AV bike riding- ParaglidingThere are also a lot of eating options around Solang Valley. Do try the momos and Maggi for sure. Also, don't forget to carry shoes as you are going to be walking around a lot."
Adventurous & Beautiful,"My husband and I visited this valley on a bike and thoroughly enjoyed the ride from our hotel in old Manali to Solang valley. The road is scenic and adventurous as it's narrow with cars coming to way. There are various activities one can do here like paragliding, cable car ride, squad bike ride and hours ride. We chose to walk up the hill to enjoy the cold chilling weather and the beauty of the valley. Definitely a must visit for all those travel to Manali, highly recommended for a day trip."
"Solang Valley , One of Manali rarest Adventure trips","This was infact the first place , I visited on my Manali locations visit.Solang valley is full of energy, with super guide who take you on tour up on himalayas.Firstly , you have to climb on rocks, which is a bit Hilly on HORSE or ETV bike,Being scared of Horses , I chosed ETV bike. Then when you reach up, there are lots of activities unlike Recliner , River Rafting, ky walk and lots more , Walk on stones which are full of snow.What are you waiting for , Just come to Manali for this fully adventurous ride(For more info)Visitwww.themagicpr.comcPriyanka Raina"
Alternate to Rohtang Pass,"I heard that when Rohtang pass is closed due to heavy ice,the visitors opted for this place.30 mins drive from main Manali town.The place is mainly for adventure activities, but you can’t go exactly to this point by cab or any other vehicle.The rod before reaching this place about 1 km away is full of rocks and drivers not willing to go.So the alternate is to book a mountain bike by paying Rs.1500/-(off season rate) for 2 adults (one child upto 12 yrs may be adjusted) to enjoy the place."
Mr.,Solang valley is a must to visit destination in Manali. A very good place for para gliding. The ride on cable car is super. The valley seems to be very beautiful in the month of November.
Beautiful Solang Valley,Mt Patru in Solang is known for skii point and paragliding. Cable car costs you 650 INR per person to take you to the top point. 360° view of beautiful valley is mind blowing.
Tour to manali,Amazing climet and nature's beauty.Everyone has to visit once in life time to see the heaven on earth.
Solang Vally,"This Cally is having adventure activities like paragliding, four wheel scooter, zip line etc. One can enjoy the paragliding with cable car or without cable car. It is safe to perform paragliding as you will have professional pilot with you."
Honeymoon,"Visit 2 couples, a lots of fun, lots of Riding, peragliding, skeeing, ball, and a lots of awesome memories"
Good scenic view,"Its very good place with natural beauty. One can go top by local bike, there one temple & waterfall available."
The most cold place. Best one. ,You can enjoy different rides especially paragliding there. There is also one shiv temple anjani mahadev there. You can enjoy the route in between these two by four wheeler scooter.
Delhi to Manali,"Himalayan trip is best,feeling cheerful with mesmerizing MANALI VALLEYS and qualified trip advisor Miss. ROHINI DHOPTA. Hotel room and service was very nice (i reached Manali at 1am, then also they arranged some food for us). Driver was good.THANKS to all for making my family trip comfortable n memorable. ThankYou Rohini dhopta ji."
Delhi to Manali,"It was great experience, Thankyou Himalayan trip and specially ROHINI DHOPTA ji for great follow up and managing whole trip"
Whiteness all around,"Once you reach the solang valley, a picturesque view unlocks. White snow covered mountains take your breadth away. The place has few coffee shops to help you enjoy the chill with comfort"
Vacation ,The most must place u should visit if u r in manali .kids will enjoy the snow skating.riding with yak n eat smoked barbeque corn is a must.it took about nearly one hour to reach the place due  to massive jam n repair the road.no pain no gain.very chill n nice climate.should try mee noodle with hot masala tea at skating area
Scenic place,This is a must visit place if you are in Manali. It is some 30mins drive from Manali town. It offers very good views of snow capped mountains. Lot of adventure activities are done here.
Serene Solang Valley!,Solang Valley is very beautiful to visit in Manali. Manali being the attraction for Tourist walking from all over the world makes it more amazing. This valley has the greenery all around and serves no. of activities for the Tourist. In snow time this Valley covers with Snow. it has Ropeway to go on the top and experience the Nature.
Solang valley in September,"We visited in September,  and there was no no snow. The real beauty is when snow is there.  So missed it."
Beautiful Snowcapped mountains and valley ,This valley is without doubt the best place to visit around Manali with snow covered Dhauladhar and Pir Panjal mountains situated on both sides
Is it safe to visit manali now?,"Roads are open or closed between Chandigarh to manali? We are planning to visit shimla manali on October 2nd, it is safe to visit? Please answer"
Solang Valley,"Solang Valley is very famous for Paragliding, Ice ski, camping and other adventure activities. when I was gone there, I did enjoy paragliding. And I recommend you to go solan valley. Go there and have fun with friends or family."
Gone are the Days,Really These lines came to my mind when I visited Solang Valley after 14-15 Years. A beautiful Spot once covered with lush green grass is now occupied by paragliding operators and sports bike operators.But still kids can enjoy different games and sporting activities. You can visit once.
Too crowded ,Though it's a popular spot it's to crowded in april you can imagine in peak months of may & June. Best time to visit is February March for tourist and December to February for adventure seekers
Great view But Gobar All Around,Place looks great. Great views. Great but super expensive gandola ride.Its let down by Cows straying all round and their gobar lying all round. Rains make that worse. Watch your steps closely.But overall good place.
Good,"Good visit. Lack of hygein food choices. Quad bikes are very expensive.Cable cars are good, Ensure safety of your own if you are taking any activity"
Snow clad mesmerizing mountain top,"Solang which is a spring flowing beside the valley creates a majestic view when peaks around are snow-capped, and you can play in the snow and cam do skiing."
Nice place heavy traffic plus I lost something,"Trip was nice but traffic was very heavy... it took nearly 3 hrs to reach solang valley from Manali (15 km) ... paragliding, waterfall point (bahubali type) all was great... place was fun my one year old kid lost one of his cute batman shoe (left) in dhaba may be no no dhaba in solang valley when he was with his father and uncle. We realised it when we got back to manali and next morning we had to leave for Delhi... called mountain bike person to search but for no result... now I feel it would have been better if complete pair would have been lost... could have been of some use for someone... but now this remaining shoe pinches me more than the happy memories of solang valley.... moral- take care of your belongings.Reply if you can suggest something to overcome this mental discomfort.electricalexp@gmail.com"
Honeymoon place,There are two option to go on hike one is by ropway which is costly and another is donkey ride.This was our package part
Friends trip,It's very beautiful place and enjoyable.we spend more of time. Very good and perfect place to enjoy with our family. So go and enjoy more time their
For Activities,"if you are looking for Activities , then you will have to visit Solang Valley. This is the place where you can do all activities at same place. From paragliding to river cross. Ropeway make it convenient to take a flight down with an instructor. Cost is from Rs 1000 to Rs 3200 depending upon length of flight."
Gorgeous but busy,"If you're going to the end of the valley where the paragliding et al is going on, be prepared for big crowds of Indian tourists in June and July. It's worth paying to take the funicular railway up the mountain as it's then very easy to get away on your own through glorious mountain scenery (ie,snow-capped Himalayas) and cedar trees. They also serve food at the top should you need it."
Lovely destination,Besides Rohtang this is  the most popular tourist destination in Manali.One has to leave vehicle  at a point and then either trek or take a mountain bike up the hill.There is a temple and also a Shiv linga under a waterfall.view is good .Worth a visit while in Manali.
Less than satisfactory experience,"I visited this place with family in April 2019. All tourist points in Manali are places where locals want to rob you. This is not right, as tourists you come to a place to relax and enjoy the beauty of the place. The bike ride from the mountain foothill to the main place costs 1000 bucks per person. This is massively overpriced. They have horses which can be taken for a lesser price, but risky. If you can walk, I suggest trek the mountain. We did it and it took us 30 to 40 minutes to reach the top. Once you are at the top there are no toilets, so please get your Nature calls down before going up. The activities are super costly and it is a joke. I would suggest you don't do then unless you have lots of money to burn. The snow shoes, suit and gloves which is rented before coming to the valley is just a money making racket. The temperature wasn't cold at all and our snow suit and gloves were getting wet. What sub-standard snow suit and gloves were provided by the rental company. Each driver has their own vendor, so they will definitely stop there, but you can make the choice. Overall the views were great but the local people behaviour and lack of facilities provided by the government, makes this a poor experience. This is my opinion which can differ from others."
no common facilities like toilet at solang valley,"I feel sorry to say that i was disappoint to find the basic necessity facilitiy  like Toilet at Solang valley were so bad then the Mobile toilet . Government has to understand that during peak season if tourist are flourished you need to handle that situation. the food joint at the top of rope way was in messy , dirty, unhygenic. how could govt allow this people to run the food joint. There were few time power failure when we wanted to do Ropeway. the traffic was bad , for every 2 km drive take 2 hours. very bad... i suggest people planning for himachal do not go during holiday season as it will be mess. After 30 year i have gone to manali. in 1988 this place was heaven. now it has become complete commercialise.   Except Weather every thing was bad."
Great for kids,"Its a beautiful valley. Though as usual the place is swarmed with commercial tourist activities. There are just too many of them. Right from zorbing, zip lining, para guilding, etc. Wonderful place for kids. I do recommend that one takes the cable ride and go up the mountain. It cost 600 bucks per person. The view from the top is breath taking. The restaurant on top is quite decent."
Trip to manali with beloved ones,"Solang valley is an excellent place to visit when you go to manali.A place where u have sports activities, Good food,beautiful nature."
possibly good in winters,abhi to kuchh nahi tha khaas. Zorbeening was a quite a disappointment once you have done it in khajiar
Recommend,"Really a nice place.There are number of activities you can do.Paragliding was there.Horse riding till snow point.Gandola ride till hill top.Charges are very high for Gandola ride, 650/- per person, kids free.It will take you at the top of the hill with a clear view of snow clad mountains.Keep your warmers handy, its icy cold on the top.There is a small restaurant up there, where you may have coffee, Maggie, noodles, dosa, tea, pav bhaji, juice etc.Worth a visit. If you have never seen snow, better to plan it a day before visiting Rohatang."
Summer holiday ,An excellent place ..lush green with facilities like para gliding and cable car. The resort is a treat by itself. Its an easy drive.
Solang valley,"Visit this place along with my family,you have to take a ATV ride or phoney ride to go on the top of mountain,the price should be govt controlled as Rs 1200 for 5 km ride is expensive.Parking your vehicle was a issue ,there were temporary local restaurant set up ,will not recommend them because of the hygiene standards.There were zip line etc ,it was fun ,but was not impressed with the safety standards.There is a lord Shiva temple ,need to clump nearly 50 to 60 steps .Rest this is place you can spend half a day along with your family on Manali visit."
Fun-adventure-Beauty combo pack !!!,"The taxi will drop you at a playground like place from where you can avail cable-car, poney or motor-bike for going up. I availed motor-bike but now on retrospect, poney option seems to be the best both in terms of cost and also the fact that they take you almost upto the base of the water-fall. The natural beauty all around the place  is really fabulous with a rampaging Beas gargling its way all through the rocky terrains. Fun activities like River crossing etc are available. For the less adventurous, just sitting idle by the river-side and soaking in the natural beauty while gulping down hot samosas/Maggie/Pakodas all along allowing the feet to be continuously rapped by the gushing water, itself is an wonderful experience. My suggestion :- Start early enough for the Rohtang Pass and cover this point on your way back to Manali. This way you will save a lot of transport cost as both these points lie in the same direction."
Best place for activities,"Rope-way and paragliding are best activities, but too expansive. Snow point is slightly far from main spot and not accessible by road."
Best View and activities,Solang has an amazing view and there are all kind of activities that you can take depending on which season you travel .Since we had visited in summers they had Rope way and Para gliding.
Amazing place,"Very amazing place full of ice whole year, only the problem is it take long time in transit, i will suggest only couple and family members with teens to go there who have young babies please don't go with your babies bcz the transit time is too long and the temperature is also in minus plus the winds also flows in speed."
Awesome place to visit ,Good place to visit. Bike ride was awesome and adventurous.Paragliding at this place is too-too expensive as compared with time duration involved in the activity. Advise to avoid this activity but it is adventurous.
so much to enjoy for every member of the family,"While the valley becomes crowded during summer holidays but it still provides lots of fun activities for the family or individuals. The view is fantastic and facilities adequate. early summers and winters are even better. Trekking, zorbing, hang gliding, dirt bike riding are some of the activities you can participate."
Should be avoided during peak season,"Very very touristy. During peak season, every tourist is trying to go to Solange Valley. Hence the major traffic jams. You'll see people everywhere. Should be avoided during peak season."
Great time at Beas river side sleeping on mat,Great time at Beas river side sleeping on mat. Kids enjoyed Beas river and we loved eating maggi there
Perfect place for Adventure Activities,Thrill seekers travelling to Manali should head towards Solang Valley for various fun filled and thrill activities like Paragliding etc. It's usually closed during extreme weather conditions. Beware of Touts and unlicensed operators. Safety First.
nice fun activities,"in 1100, u can do river corssing, zorbing, rope gliding and jumping..if weather is nice, you will enjoy exponentially"
Paragliding!!!,It was a beautiful paragliding experience at Solang Valley. The team of piolets who help you paraglide are skilled and experts. They make you feel comfortable.
The Heaven gateway,"Solang Nala derives its name from combination of words Solang and Nallah. It is a side valley at the top of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, India 14 km northwest of the resort town Manali on the way to Rohtang Pass, and is known for its summer and winter sport conditions.A lots of review will tell you about the accommodation and facilities solang valley offers but the very few will you about the inside story.Lets goSolang is located Near the main Manali city just a few kilometers to reach solang from manali is very easy just take another jeep ride or a rental car. solang hike is very much fun to go about in winters actually when the higher points are covered in snow a local can take you up by a horse ride or you can just walk and enjoy the trek. don’t forget to enjoy the mountain delicacies the magi  noodles and tea  also just go about and wander alone as a traveler into the woods with lush green trees and rocks so gigantic. don’t forget to make a snow man and slide off the snow. When going to solang don’t go as a tourists just go as traveler"
Cabin car trip in Solang valley,"Lush green snow clad mountain with a nice view of the entire area from the top of the pt where Cabin car leaves you. You can take para glide, if you like getting a 360 degree view of the snow clad mountains."
Attraction of activity,there is 2 types of paragliding there one is short paragliding cost @ rs 1000 for 45 seconds second costs rs 3200 long for which u have to go up by ropeway including price and very high pragliding zip lining cost rs 200 balloon cost rs 250 river crossing rs 250 must relax at the paragliding groung with sitting on your mat under shade and enjoy seeing paragliding must  take all eating stuff from manali or u can buy there only nearly 14 km from manali but due to traffic zam ith took 2 hours to reach there
Best for Adventure Activities,"We did all the adventure activities available like Zorbing, Paragliding, Rope Climbing etc. the charges are a bit high but kids will enjoy"
paragliding,"nice place to go paragliding, ATV rides and trekking.Be ready to mix in thronging crowds during the holiday season though."
Fun filled with multiple activities to try out,"If you are a nature freak, or outdoor person; you will simply love this place. Be it parasailing, ropeway, zipline, or any other adventure of this kind; this is the best place to try it out near Manali"
Most happening place in Manali,"Solang valley is the most happening place in Manali and almost 100% people visit this place. Many activities can done be done.Snow ScooterParaglidingSnow climbingRope way trollyQuad BikeHoarse RidingTyre SlidingOne should negotiate for a package covering atleast 4 rides, which could be cheaper (about 1200 to 1800), also you can negotiate for extra time if they do not come down on rates."
Crowded though recommended,"its about 10 Km away from Manali town, very crowded with poor infrastructure. Multiple actvities as para gliding are available, place has a temple which can be taken with ATV, horse or walk. We took ATV and was really fun. Near to temple there is a lord shiva linga which is must if you have came over on that top.We missed other activities as kid was too small(1 year Kid) , ensure that you start early to avoid any congestion/traffic."
Crowded,"Better visit Gulaba, Marhi or Old manali to get away from the never ending crowd here at solang valley. Out of all adventure sports only paragliding is worth it. You can't learn skiing in 2 hours and the gear which they provide is not for every size and age. Food is quite costly, 80 INR for Maggi. Too many people selling Kesar and Shilajeet XD, you'll feel like you are in a farmer's market."
Family Spot,"If you want to do various activities like paragliding, tube, skiing, Zorbing etc everything can be done here."
Place of Activities,"its around 14 km from Manali, though the road are crowded and Jams are frequent during season, if clear will take you half an hour. in summer its green and activities are horse riding, para gliding , trolley. In winters skiing and snow scooters add up. you can get your video shoot when doing para gliding"
Great location but the infrastructure surrounding it very terrible,"Sollang valley is a great place to appreciate snowcapped mountain especially during the winter.  However, being the tourist attraction, the infrastructure is in terrible state. It seems most of the activity by the operator are not regulated and don’t have any standard being laid out. Please beware of tourist operator which will show you some video of snow falls which they say are happening right now and will try to convince you to join their tour. However, it turn out they are cheating and there are not even snow at the place they suggested. Our tour guide were insisted us to buy the winter wear from one of the shop along the road. Thank god we didn’t buy it. The winter wear are in a very dire state and I don’t know if they ever wash it. If you have your own winter wear, it’s more than enough for solang valley. Plus if you want to take photo of yourself, you definitely don’t want to be in that dress they were selling. I don’t feel you need to buy extra winter cloth as the temperature is not that cold. We went during the peak which in January and it seems our own winter wear is just fine."
Solang Valley,"Beautiful place surrounded by nature. Hills and vallies mesmerized ones experience. Even During summer, snow could be found. Snow activities such as skiing, climbing, paragliding, bungee jumping are available here for experience thrill. Recommended to everyone."
Whole Manali is Crowded,"During season days, Whole manali is nothing but traffic jam. Sometimes even 2 kms can take 2 -3 hours. Road construction is going on hence it is full of dust"
Fun filled trip at Manali,Everyone would suggest to cover this place at nice you are at Manali. Should visit the place only if you want to do paragliding or gondola ride; paragliding for kids is a fun activity for them. Takes 2 hours from city due to traffic in peak season
Excellent place for adventure lovers,What a place really it's one of best place for adventure lovers and one reach 10k feet by rope way and enjoy scenic view of snow capped mountains.  One can try paragliding  at 10k feet also their is small paragliding for children @500 rs . If one wanted to visit shiv temple can take horses or ATV @1500 rs . Full day trip can enjoy nature at best .
Good for activities,solang valley is basically an alternative for Rohtang in winters and in summers a place used as a base camp for various treks .It has a good cable car ride which may excite some people. Best time to visit throughout the year but not when snowfall is heavy
Pathetic Staff,"Please be careful when you go with friends and family. The staff are out there to cheat and mock you. First....the access to the car parking is not visible...if you have a Govt vehicle, you can park anywhere you want and the staff wanted us to remove our vehicle so some Govt car can be parked in a normal.parking area. In the ticket counter, the swipe ma home does not work and carry lots of cash for the rope car ride. On top, the facilities can be much better... however is very dirty and the staff charge a bomb for the tea and other refreshments ... The rope car operators are the one ones who are very courteous and very helpful and even lent their umbrellas when it rained. The guys in the counter are horrible...please be careful with the money you give as the tried cheating us....once swiping our card and later asking for cash, saying the card machine did not work."
A beautiful sightseeing area ,"Solang Valley located in the heart of Himachal is a great place which offers various services to reach the top. There are ATV bikes available, horses and ofcourse ropeway. Paragliding is also done at Solang Valley. Gulaba is a place where you can find snow at this point of time. The route for Solang Valley isn’t that bad. Also, snow costumes are available on the way if one wants to enjoy playing in the snow. Maggis are available throughout the route"
Solang Valley,"A nice place to hang for few hours... paragliding and many other sports available here. In evenings or early mornings this place look peaceful and nice. But best time to visit this place is in Dec or Jan because at that time this whole valley is covered with snow and one can enjoy all the sports activities to the maximum. This place looks so amazing, sublime and   completely different when covered with snow."
Nice but overhyped,"Great location, wonderful scenery with proximity to snow clad mountains and rolling green hills. We had heard too much about this valley but unfortunately felt it was a bit overhyped. Massive traffic jams take the fun out of this visit, most of the times. And the touts along the drive, who sell snow jackets and boots and what not, attire you like a cosmonaut unmindful of the need for it, leaving one hot and stuffy in summer. And the farce of the skiing experience (at Rs.2000 per person) is another dampener. Leave early, by 6.30 AM, to get ahead of the traffic snarls. Don’t bother with the cosmonaut suits if you have a decent jacket that keeps cold out."
paradise,"what can I say about this place...nature at its best...one of the must visit destinations in Manali.. .lush greenery,snow capped mountains everywhere...the cable car ride was beautiful.."
nice location . Template is situation at very nice surroundings. i love the ambience.its very beautiful and scenic.,nice location . Template is situation at very nice surroundings. i love the ambience.its very beautiful and scenic.
Not as expected,We visited this place during april time and we didn't feel very excited because of snow area where we play is very less.
Snow capped mountains,Take cable car at solang valley to reach at some higj altitude to see simply breath taking snow capped mountains with fresh snow. There are no adventure activities at top.
Quiet and calm place in hills,"We visited here in April 2019. There was no snow at the base however we noticed a Gandola ride (Ropeway) to top. Ticket (in April 2019) costed us INR 650 per person. We could see glaciers of snow below when traveling in the Ropeway Car. To our surprise, the top of Solang Valley was full of Snow and we enjoyed a lot there"
Lovely manali,"Grest place to see snow there.Many adventure activity can be done there like paragliding,skiing,qudra bike riding,yak riding.you will get the warm clothe there on some rental price"
Took the cable car ride,Sollang valley has various modes of transport to reach the snow points... Quad bikes (rs.1000 for 2+1) or horses (much cheaper) or cable car (rs.650 per person). We were not sure about rates and so took the cable car up. Though expensive and a bit of a walk to reach the station was relatively less crowded..we got the snow point all to ourselves.. really lovely experience. You can hire the Himachali dress up at the snowpoint for 50rs per person (down below the cable car station a lady was saying 100 per person). There is a basic restaurant on the top that serves the usual foods available in the area. Be careful about rates of everything. Seem to be hiked.
Spring visit - May - pro and cons,"Alone the way, the touts were trying to sellus some activity like riding of Yak, rental of skiing equipment and snow suit . We went for yak ride at 2000 rupee for a couple including winter suit. Which we ask him many time any extra we need to pay and he keep saying “EVERYTHING included”. Ok we pay. When our driver drove us up, there’s no Yak yet but has to pay 1500 rupee for a ATV to get our YAK ride - is abit further up and rocky. It was a totally dishonest communication from the tout who is selling the sport activities. Secondly, there so little snow why still trying to rent skiing equipment.We also found out from others that a yak ride is only 300-400 rupee.  To be fair to the touts the winter suit include boots is good to have but not the skiing equipment during May season. Nice view refer to photo."
Picutre perfect with snow,"Snow was less when we visited , still worth it . You can indulge in skieing , parasailing etc . Fun time guaranteed ."
Just for adventure,Solang Valley is beautiful place. If you have money in your pocket then you have to go. Because there is minimum exp. is Rs. 2000 per person. There is paragliding Rs. 1000 & Ropeway Car 650 per person. Total time for these activities 20 mnts approx.
An Adventurer's Paradise,"The Solang Valley is beautiful and an adventurer's paradise with para gliding, river rafting, mountain biking and trekking. The cable car takes you to a height from where you can enjoy the scenic beauty of the entire valley."
"a must visit, especially when snow is there",an hours drive from Manali this valley is about 2000ft higher. so its significantly cooler. must do the adventure sports which is available everywhere. or to get away from crowds one can trek a bit higher for relative solitude
its your luck,"this place changes based on when you are visiting. if you visit in early march or February, you will get lots of snow and less people. But once April starts thousands of people will be there and hardly any place to walk. but you can walk around this place. Also very nice ropeway."
Amazing when filled with snow,"Solang was filled with snow in the last week of March, when we were there, and the experience was amazing.There were enough snow activities and average of 4 feet snow at the base, hence we did not go to the top from where skiing and paragliding take place. Plus, the ropeway/gondola to the top, though open for everyone, seems to be privately run and quite expensive.Given the natural beauty all around, the place can be so much more developed though. The access road to the place and parking for vehicles gets choked. Also, there aren't too many proper eating outlets, apart from maggie and omelettes stalls."
Enjoyed snow and the cable car ride,"Visited solang valley in the first week of April 2019 . Actually the snow is very dirty once u reach the valley. One can play with snow around this place if you dont want to take the cable car ride which takes you to the top of the mountain.The cable ride costs you Rs 650 per person for a round trip. It is quite expensive only, put the view high up is very nice. From there we walked up in the snow and spent around 3 hours playing in the snow. please wear proper clothing so that u can enjoy the snow. A good pair of gloves will help a lot !!"
Visit for Snow...and related activity,Solang Valley is the place fo snow and related activities....We visited during mid April'19 and found snow every whereGo early to avoid traffic... should leave by 8:30 or so..Take snow suit on hire...fixed price at all places.

But ride is good...view is much better from top. Less people...there is a cafe at the top. And yes washroom as well...If wants to do paragliding can be done from top of rope way...If you do not want to have a look at view from top....skip it... because same snow is also available at below...Visit Shiva temple on ATV ride.... negotiate it....Negotiate for all activities you do there at Solang Valley...You can spend 3 to 4 hours as per your requirement and can visit Mall road in evening....
For snow Lovers,"Do your snow activity in Sloang valley, get really crowded , during winter you may not reach the place coz of snow slides and land slides. best time you want to see falling snow less crowd and readability, feb last week to march end.  you can do li bit od snow mobile riding skying and snow driving. the package will cost you from 3000 to 6000 for a pack of 4. better to carry your own gloves . you can rent the dress from many outlets available there. we took almost 4 hours to cover 16 kilometers  coz od land slides and vehicle getting trapped during the month of March. Its a place to visit in Manali"
YOU MISS THIS YOU MISS EVERYTHING,"I don't have words to express. This is the place to be, especially if you are bringing kids, they will love this place. So much fun, so much to do."
First point of snow from Manali in April,"If Gulaba and Kothi are closed, this is the only option we have for snow playing in April. The bottom landing area is dirty and muddy though. you have to take the cable car (charge Rs. 650 for anybody above 3 feet) to get to the snow playing area. Other places are having either dirty snow or far off for families to reach (need a lot of hiking with proper winter attire to reach there)"
Snow covered Solang,"Nice experience on snow at Solang. Hired jacket (single piece top and bottom and boot) from Manali before travelling to Solang. Govt. rate is Rs. 250 per jacket with shoe. Shop owner insists to take ski package or other packages. Took ski package @ rs. 1000 per person (including jacket), good for one time experience, but not worth. This spend helped in taking some snaps, which probably can be done by paying 100 bucks to the person sitting with ski. Likewise some more packages available. But most enjoyable is to play and roam around in snow. As weather was sunny, we could remove jacket and enjoyed 2-3 hrs. stay.Need to buy gloves and socks separately. Socks are of different kind and must, gloves one can carry or buy. All @100. Goggles not mandatory, though they insist."
Only snow destination when Rohtang is closed,Wonderful place and must do place when you are in manali.The place is about 20 kilometer from manali on the way you can take snow clothes which are available on nominal rent all snow activity can be done here skiing etc.
Solang Valley,"Solang Nala (Valley) derives its name from combination of words Solang (Nearby village) and Nallah (water stream). It is a side valley at the top of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, India 14 km northwest of the resort town Manali on the way to Rohtang Pass, and is known for its summer and winter sport conditions. The sports most commonly offered are parachuting, paragliding, skating and zorbing.A place worth visiting all round the year, that’s exactly what makes this place the perfect holiday destination. However, the best time to visit Solang Valley depends on why you wish to go uphill. If you’re looking to indulge in activities like paragliding, gondola, and more, the lush green summers are the ideal time. But, if you’re a winter lover and feel like tasting the thrill of skiing and skating, the snowy weather between November to February makes for the perfect time to plan your trip.09:00 AM - 05:00 PM is the time slot for paragliding. This activity is generally shut down during the monsoon season due to unfavourable weather conditions. Cost of paragliding varies from INR 1000-1200.Zorbing can be pursued here at a price of INR 500 per head and is a definite must try. Price: INR 500 and aboveQuad Biking: Price: INR 900 to INR 1000Skiing: Price: INR 300 and aboveSolang Valley Ropeway: Price: INR 450TIMING: All days of the week 10:00 AM - 6:00 PMTIME SPENT: 3 to 4 Hours"
A great place that is too commercialised ,"Very nice place where you can enjoy, but as happens, you can see perils of commercialisation over here... too much of bargaining... Deteriorating Hygiene and Cleanliness..."
It was my Home For Some days (Solang Camp) ,"One Of The Beautiful Place with beautiful grassland and adventures activities. Pleasant beauty all around. It is Just 12 kms from Manali and Taxi, Buses, Bikes and Auto will be easily available from Manali only buses have specific timing and even if you are traveling by bus you have to walk approx three kms to reach Solang valley. There is no direct bus to Your destination. All kind of Adventures activities are available - Paragliding, Rock Climbing,  River Rafting,  Trekking,  Night Camping,  Ball Ride , Horse Riding etc.  Be aware of the charges sometimes they might over Charge you.  #keeptraveling #anilthakurtravelblogs"
Solang valley in Apr mid,Don't visit this place during Apr mid as you will not able to see Solang valley as shown in picture like lush green. Snow was there but with mud so not able to see white snow and not lush green scenic view. I will suggest to go Khajjiar instead of Solang valley
What an experience skying!!!!!!,"Beautiful place covered with snow. It is lot of fun skying, of course with the help of locals. Landscape is captivating. There are other activities such as Zipline, quad bike ride, etc. available in Solang Valley.  Did not feel like coming out of the place. If anyone visiting in December, suggest you to reach the valley early morning to avoid traffic jam."
Must visit place,This is must visit place if u are in manaliGo in early morning to this place bcoz there ia single road to reach there and very rush at this roadThere is very good snow and adventure sportsDont take adventure package from guide bcoz they charge you higher charge from solang valleyGo solang valley and take there any sport adventure
India hot tub time machine of skiing ,"Beautiful valley and if you’ve skied in developed countries before, this is a trip back to the 1980s. Unreal!"
Not too great ,"Solang Valley is not too great. The snow is hard and dirty. There are some animal poop around. There are many adventure sports like snow mobile, paragliding, zorbing, skiing and snow tubing. We only tried snow tubing which was OK. But it wasn't completely safe. It was very crowded and a bit noisy. A good place for someone who wants to try some adventure sports but an ok place for someone who wants to enjoy the snow. There were some plastic wrappers and beer bottles thrown around in the snow. The parking is an issue and if you come late, you have to park 1.5km away from the valley. We came late and had to take an ATV to the valley. 4 of us managed to squeeze into 1 ATV which cost us Rs. 400 one way. If you walk a bit forward, the snow is cleaner. The view is great if you walk a little higher. There is no toilet here (which is a great inconvenience). The view is good but overall the place is not too great."
Could be a good sport to visit bu needs access infrastructure,Visited here mid March 2019. Off-peak but still horrendous traffic jam.Visitors park their cars anywhere along the narrow access road making the journey very tedious.Local developement authroties need to do a lot more by way of carparks and strictly enforcing parking restrictions elsewhere.Cannot imagine the bedlam during peak seasons of May June.Tourists must put pressure on the Development authorities to improve and regulate traffic otherwise give this place a miss.
Lovely plaxet and lot of snow to enjoy,We had fun doing skiing. We played with snow and made snow man. Having Maggi at that location is memorable. You will find snow everywhere. It so soothing to eyes to one who stays in Mumbai. Loved the place.
Perfect Place to Enjoy Snow,"Perfect Place to Enjoy & Play in Snow with Family / Friends. We were blessed to have full snow with a clear weather to enjoy the whole afternoon.- Avoid the skiing package. Not worth unless you are skiing fans.- Just take the boots & coat available everywhere at fixed price.If you are the adventurous types, don't forget to take the paragliding ride, the one from the top after taking the cable car ride atop the mountain. The below mountain one is just childish.We also enjoyed the tyre-tube slide a lot. Tip: Wait till the late afternoon (just before closing time) and they will let you do it for throw away prices."
Amazing experience,"When we had planned out trip to Manali in first week of April we were not sure whether weer will get to experience snow. It was a great surprise to see so much snow and snow activity. The surrounding mountains are so beautiful. You could spend hours and hours just looking at them.The way/rd to solang valley gets crowded, it would be good to go there early to beat the traffic. In the afternoon/evening again getting out of Solang to Manali gets completely jam packed. We had wait nearly for an hr. Plan to go early and leave early to save time."
SNOW EVERYWHERE ,Place is awesome. Since Rohtang is still close so to experience Snow it is the best place. Not too high . Very clean snow do far. One can enjoy skiing here . Small food joints here u can enjoy tea cold drinks biscuits and Maggi  Noodles . One can spend 2-3 hrs. One has to wear snow boots and the snow suits which can be taken on rent in the way . Suit and boots rent is Rs 250-350 . Don’t forget to take your sun glasses . A package with suit boot and skiing for 3 of us was 2500/- . One has to  bargain with them and with the Cab
Snow point great fun,Visited with family.  Lots of snow in the valley. Lots of snow activities. My family and I enjoyed a lot. The activities are a bit expensive but are lots of fun.
nice place to visit,"Great place to visit with family. the dress cost Rs.250/per person for rental, need to buy gloves, socks if needed cost rs. 100 each. The local force to take packages which costed me Rs.6500 for 4 members(including dress) with yak ride, Skiing and tube slide - better to avoid the packages.However we enjoyed......it...."
We got Snowfall and it was all we wanted,"A must visit place if you visit Manali. We went during winters this time and we got snowfall and we enjoyed the snow with all the activites. From Paragliding, Skieng and all the other rides."
about everything,As far as the location is very good and all you are excellent from the well it must visit Europe because there is very good view it will be cost around 650 Rupees per person but if you go at the top it will your all all money is not wasted.Where is the
Good place for family and newly weds,"The place has roads which get jammed regularly. I travelled by bike and it was far more comfortable than to get stuck in long jamsOn reaching donot take any type of package from anyoneTry tube slide which cost around 100 per personTry snow bike, it cost around 1500 for long ride and it is very adventurous.Donot take paragliding in solang valley, it cost around 3200 person for high fly, also pilots are not licensed people,so better to avoidAlso there is short fly which cost around 1000 per person and u have to walk 30 mtrs up for taking the glide, not worth the moneyAtv rides are also the things to avoid as there are jams on the roads."
Solang Valley - A Dreamland,"From manali it is near about 17km. Cab fare rs. 900 but it varies. This year huge amount of snow fall occurs in manali so it is expected that you will get snow in the middle of may also. But traffic is very bad. To cover this 17km it takes more than 2hrs. No problem of food and drinking water. Paragliding, ice sketing are common activities but very costly varies from 1000 to 3000. Dress cost rs 250 per person. You will forget all these expenses when you will see the natural beauty."
Awesome snow fall,Best time to visit a great snow fall i got restaurant and foods are also awesome on solang valley but you have to rent a clothes before reach the main place if you not rent a clothes you cannot enjoy your trip clothes and shoes on rent will easily available on local shops on cheap rates
Second best I'm Manali..... If Rohtang pass is closed ,If Rohtang pass is closed then this is the place to visit for seeing and other activities. However guide cost is too much... INR 2500 for a couple is high;  road is congested and there's heavy traffic on returning from the valley with almost 1 and half hour of wastage of time in traffic. The traffic however was due to random parking of tourists vehicle only.
snow ❄️ snow everywhere ,amazingly beautiful. Nature at its best. Rope way available. Try skiing ⛷ Qudrabikes rides are awesome
A treat to the EYES,The place is beautiful. The best of Nature. Saw the place on my way from Manali to Leh-Ladakh. I did not see snow as it was not the main season. I did not wait here much as i was on a road trip.
Solang Valley,Nice place to visit for entertainment. Rope way ride was good. Amazing view from the height of 3200 meters. Paragliding adventure was there too for adventure lovers. you should try opt to reach the place by 4X4 scooter. It was fun ride.
Popular Attraction,"I went to Solang Valley. During winters, as the valley is covered with snow, skiing is a popular sport here, with training institutes and trainers located in the valley to supervise skiers and train beginners. It is great place to go."
Heaven on the earth,"This is one of the beautiful place that I ever seen in my life. It's truly heaven on the earth if you visiting this place in winter season especially when it's snowing. The scene was breathtaking when all the mountains covered with white glacier and river passing by through mountains. There are lots of activities available which are costly and they are also offering winter clothes on rent with activities packages which even more costlier. But if You want to enjoy this thrilling experience then you can surely go for it which will be lifetime memory. But carry enough warm clothes, woolen Sox, Gloves which will save your money."
Love to visit Manali,I can say that you will love this place whole life if you visit once. Solang valley and Mall road is the best places.
amazing place,this beautiful valley just blew my mind when i first saw with me and my friends went up with atv which cost us around 800 rs for a round trip
Beautiful place with adventure sports.,This is a must visit spot for everyone! Rope car ride takes you to the top of the mountain with spectacular views! Sipping a cup of coffee watching the scenic views is mind blowing. You got para gliding but it is got expensive now. Do not opt for lower attitude para gliding as it is no much fun. OPT for a higher attitude one. You will be gliding for 15 to 20 minutes and make sure you have an action camera with you.You can hire a ATV motor bike rather than a horse where they take you to many places and you could spend your own time with no restrictions and you could also drive the ATV. Avoid zip liner in this place as it is a very short one! There are other places for zip liners.
Don't waste money for activities,"The place is good. But I suggest don't waste money for activities like Yak riding, River crossing ( they won't make us to cross the river ) , Skating. I had to spend Rs 5000 for all these activities. I suggest to go for trekking (if you are a trekking enthusiast ) to jogini falls. They will charge Rs 1000 for guide.This is as per guide information. But go as a group for safety and security."
Do not miss,Solang Valley is a must if you go to Manali. You can take the quad bikes of horses. You can also enjoy the activities on site but they are not very safe.
Want to Play in Snow? Come here...,Come and play in snow... Dont forget to rent clothes and gloves. Because without that we cant enjoy properly. A must visit.
"Awesome place, must visit","Places like this gives you lifetime memories, place fully covered with snow all over, a small water flow give place heaven like look, adventure sports available, snow scooter, ice skating...Very romantic place"
Ethereal,"As we started our time in Solang valley we were a bit disappointed seeing the litter, pan spitting and dirt everywhere at the base. We felt it was too much commercialized. Once we went up the rope-way to the pristine snow, it was a different experience all together. There was abundance of clean, fresh snow everywhere. Gentle sun. We played in the snow for a long time. We slid down the snow which was an exhilarating experience. But we really wish it is not so much commercialized. The ATVs were making the snow oily. There was strong smell of fuel which polluted the air.. Plastic waste dumped everywhere. Pan stains on the white snow stood out like a sore thumb. It is really disappointing to see the nature being treated so carelessly and selffishly. Wish administration took action to keep the place clean. Also we, as tourists should  behave in a responsible manner."
Snow...Snow...Snow,A wonderful experience to the valley with snow all over...Had the best vacation of my recent times...
"Good for domestic tourists, not foreigners","If you come from a country that has snow, or you've traveled to snow destinations (Japan, NZ, Canada etc.), then this is a skip for you. Don't listen to your travel agents (as I did). The ski is best suited for beginners - I was boggled at what they were offering as a ""ski adventure"". There are no chair lifts, barely any safety or demarcated zones and the rentals look shoddy. Travellers who are tired of being accosted at every monument/temple/attraction will not enjoy this either. Couldn't get any peace and quiet without agents trying to hawk their activities."
Solang ,"I couldn’t see it in real, we had to stop midway coz it was closed because of snow and all. Overall i have heard it was way too good!"
Lovely Comfortable stay at Solang Valley Resort,"Staying at the the Solang Valley Resort was a great experience, staff was fantastic as well as the service was incredible. The Snow fall added to the great experience."
SNOW COVERED VALLEY,"You should visit Solang Valley during winter enjoy snow and related activities. Please check weather report before you pack for Manali and Solang valley. Once snowing starts there is good chance that you may get stuck there. Be careful while you drive and walk on snow | ice. Cars may slip off the road, you may fall down. Take a local guide or driver to show u around. In Solang Valley you can do lot of adventure activities like snow mobiling, skating , paragliding , ATV rides , horse rides on snow etc."
Garciakavalam ,"I had one of the most memorable time of my life . I spent about 5 hours at Solang Valley . Tried my hand at Skiing, Yak ride . Enjoyed thoroughly"
Holiday visit,Excellent  all games are good .Full off ice and snow nature is good we enjoyed well all rides are very good
It's a good experience,"Reaching here I will say little expensive. If you are 1-2 people, try to form a group. Preferably from hotel. So that 4X4 cost will be shared among you.If going in winter, 4X4 will be almost necessary. Your taxi won't go there.Otherwise activity and beauty and snow, everything is good in the valley."
Must Visit!,"Solang Valley is a must visit place if you're traveling to Manali. If you love doing Adventure sports like zipline, skiing, you should surely visit this place. There are ATV's, horses, yak rides to go to the main area."
Definitely one of the highlight of Manali trip!!,"This place is not that from Manali Town Centre. Parking is available. To go to the certain point for the main attraction you either can hike / take a buggy / or a horse ride.I personally feel if you are in natures lap, why not enjoy all the traditional way (either a hike or a horse ride). You will be approached by the people who offer rides (of course at a charge – buggy and horse both)Make sure to bargain and fix the charges before getting on.We opted for Horse ride, did not calculate the duration of the trip to the point but definitely wasn’t that far. The Uncle who took us to the drop off point advised us that he would be waiting till we return after visiting the place, be it 2hrs or 3hrs. while many horse owner share the contact number with clients and ask them to call at least 30min before they descend so they are there for them. As in between they can make another trip.At this point you will see many photographers approaching you, they offer to take pictures (using DSLR) and share with you instantly through USB/ direct in the phone at the end of the trip or once you are done with the number of photos you prefer. You have stalls around selling woolen clothes, corn cobs, magi, tea, coffee and quick snacks. There’s river crossing also done here but we did not try here.And the adventure begins, you start hiking or passing through the man made walk ways you can enjoy the snow. When we visited it had recently snowed so we were lucky enough to make most of the fun. Spent good enough time taking photos and adoring the gorgeousness of the surrounding. There are many exquisite photo spots, even at the waterfall. The waterfall is from a busted pipe But it adds splendor to the neighborhood.When you return back to the parking lot, the other side has Paragliding option. 2 charges, 1 –INR1000 and another INR3200 or so. 1st 1 is just a baby distance. Second one looks nice, but Paragliding is Kullu is amazing with magnificent views.Toilet facilities are available near the parking lot and also at the drop off point where the adventure begins.This is definitely a must do attraction when in Manali !! Worth it."
The Best Adventure Valley of India,"Solang is easily the mecca of adventure sport lovers in India !ust in twoi days in the moth of Jan one could do Paragliding, Xorbing , Snowboarding, Skiing, Sledging, ATB rides, Snow Scooter rides, Gondola ride, 4x4 Gypsy rides, horse riding, yak rides, tubing, zip lining, rock climbing, rappelling, treks, birding , nature walks and what have you. Solang Valley is easily a one stop shop for adventurers of all age and categories !"
Nature at its best!,"For a family of four from Australia, the Solang valley provided us with a perfect winter sport playground. The scenery is just spectacular and it made the long car journey from Chandigarh, worthwhile. Due to the long stretches of roadworks, traffic and ice, the car journey to the Solang valley from Chandigarh, took us a very tiring 11 hours. Snow shoes and clothing can be hired for the day, from vendors along the roadside at a very good price (INR 150/person). The snow sports were very reasonably priced and certainly made our holiday to this very beautiful part of the world, a very economical action-packed one!"
Beautiful beautiful !,"Its beautiful mountain range and some snow to play around. The ground in the starting point had no much snow though vendors forcing us to try skiing and scooter kindaa to Mahadev temple for fresh snow.. we took cable car lone of worth 650/- each and was worth a try. We had wonderful time on top and the view from cable car is beautiful. Suggestion - be careful with photographers and so called ""coach"" around on top. Their filthy money making effort is worthless."
Beauty at its best!,"I enjoyed skiing there and is a treat to the eyes. The massive mountains , delicious Maggi and the cold weather. Should we ask for more? Besides , let  the pictures below do the talking for Solang Valley."
Best experience,"Solang valley is the spot for paragliding in manali.they provide you two type of paragliding.1st is short one cost about 1000/- where you have to run from a slop on your own.2nd one is from very high hill which cost rs.3500/- you have to reach to the hill with your guide by roapway then he takes you to the paragliding point.Where he fastens you with paraglider then be ready to fly.It is very adventurous you are actually flying like a bird over the trees,hills best experience of my life.One should give it a try if you are going there."
Nature being destroyed by Tourists,"The amount of snow in this place has been going down over the last 3 years - Probably global warming. Thankfully we went early morning - 9:30 AM. The number of vehicles were low at that point. There is enough snow to play around, but not much to ski around. Rubbish - Plastic, Maggi covers, Beer bottles etc - is strewn across places. We did have a good 2-3 hours there , but on the way back the line of cars was close to 2-3 kms. This place cannot handle this huge a quantum of tourists.If it continues like this, we would have succeeded in destroying natures beauty"
White wonderland,"A sure place to visit. Not to be missed. The journey to this place is okayish.  Not very good scenic road.  But surely the eyes keep tracing the snow clad mointain peaks while traveling to this place. On the way to this place you can find many shops which rent out the snowproof  dumgrees/ coats and gum boots.  Its okay to rent out on the way itself brcause we can get choice of size/color etc. Once u reach the valley point,  you will be cahsed by numerous guides offering  the snow activities list. One thing to note is... To reach the activities point you can either trek/ take horse ride/ snow motor bike.  There is a counter at the start point for the to and fro snow motor bike. The biker will leave you till the activity point. There is also cable car ride available for taking the scenic view ride. Please note...  The gum boots which we buy frm the shops arent enuf...  The feet gets too cold."
loved the place !,"Solang Valley is known as for snow place and related activity , loved we tried zip line and cable car and had lots of fun in snow !"
Dont Try Paragliding,"There is no safety whatsoever when it comes to paragliding.I did try it and rolled in the slope and almost hit my head in a rock , whats more is that there is no one around to help you up either, the pilot who should be with you simply shouts every time and does not even lift a finger to take you to safety.I tried a second time ( big mistake) and fell down again almost 5 or 6 times rolled in Snow and stones, could not feel my fingers, no one to see me through to reach a safe place to climb up or down, when i gathered myself to climb up i saw other para gliders, running down towards me, i had to almost fall on my face to save myself, finally got back to the rope car and came down, Totally not worth the hype.place is good for Scenery , but not so good for paragliding , run by amateurs whose only aim is to make more money."
"Ice Everywhere, Still Very Crowded and Adventurous",We went to the Solang Valley to try some adventure sports and play in the snow.We were taken to the top in ATV bikes. We tried the Snow Rafting and Skiing but could not do paragliding and zipline due to an early sunset. We enjoyed our time and would want to visit again.
I urge all of you not to try Paragliding,"I was pretty excited about doing an adventure sport, that too paragliding. But, it's my humble request to all of you not to try it at all. I could have lost my life today. There are no safety arrangements whatsoever. The pilot walked straight up to the flight site. There is absolutely no arrangements to walk, nothing to hold and a a little mistake can mean the end. I slipped several times and shouted for the pilot. He did come after watching me struggle. But, he could have walked with me. It was a very steep climb and a slight slip could have caused me my life. Obviously, they wouldn't have given a damn caus I signed a document. But, signing that never meant that my life is worthless. If you care about your safety, please don't try it or ask anyone else to do so. I wish I took pictures to show all of you but I couldn't see anything beyond my safety that time."
Snow,"Good place for snow n play  lots of activities like skies, cable car, bike ride lots of snaps to eat etc."
Cold and freezings ,"Nice place to hangout with friends. Best part the trolley which take you up to the valley! They charge 650 INR/person for that. There is option for. Paragliding also but we miss that due to long waiting, if any one wants to do that they should leave the hotel in morning! Food in valley not that good, I would suggest that food should avoid there, you can have fresh juice or tea coffee!"
Chilling Scenery,"Chilling freezing cold this place is and it has to be as its covered with snow. There are activities like zipline, yak ride, skiing, tube ride and paragliding. The best part is having hot maggi in such a climate."
The most popular activity here is paragliding,"Solang Valley, a picturesque place famous for its ski slopes and the glacier in the winter months is home to rock climbing, hiking, balloon rides, paragliding, rafting, skiing and zorbing, an absurd activity of rolling in a closed sphere.The most popular activity here is paragliding, through which one can experience the ethereal serenity while flying in the air. One can enjoy the beautiful bird's eye view of landscapes below."
Great Experience,"We were here to find snow and this place did not disappointed us. Kids enjoyed a lot in snow, we went from cable ride and the view was awesome.  There was snow all around and it is must visit place for everyone who visit Manali"
Solang valley,"A place where you can indulge in some adventure sports . HPTDC conducts a day tour here alongwith a visit to the Naggar valley. If you are not interested in para-gliding, then there is nothing much to do here except gaze around and admire the green carpeted valley surrounded by snow capped and forested hills."
Found valley with no Snow,Traveled there in mid-September. There was no snow at that time. Adventure activities were not much interesting. Paragliding charge is too high comparing wiht the timing they are providing.
Solang Valley Snow Experience,Good place to enjoy with many activities associated with snow for family and friends.Better to wear good winter gears and boots and care about walking around the area because rick in falling when walk on ice on the road.You can take life time memorable photos and videos with your loved once.
Adventure Activities,It is approx. 50kms away from Manali. It is famous for adventure activities in snow. If you go to Rohtang pass then u can avoid this place.
No go Manali ,Manali is choked. Roads are all under construction. All the roads to anywhere in and around Manali are choked and it’s just impossible to get anywhere. Leave your cars and walk wherever possible. Manali is a NO GO for minimum 3-4 years till the roads get constructed. It’s beautiful no doubt but on foot. In car it’s really frustrating to get stuck for hours for places only half hour away. We left our car outside Manali while on the way to Solang and came back to the hotel on foot.
Awesome place to visit in Manali,"I have visited Manali on 10th of December 2018, But didn't find snow in the lower part of Manali where I have booked my hotel but the people there they told me after 25th December it will be snow in lower part of Manali as well. But to do snow activities and if you are lucky you can witness live snowfall. It's an awesome experience for me and my wife in Solang Valley. Lot's of activities therein Solang Valley but we have only taken a few things like a dress for snow point and a guide who will take some pics and also they provide some ice skating gears for few mints and click few poses for us. And for that, they use to charge for 2000 including dress and that guide for 2 people. I feel it's fine to get it for once so that you will feel good.We have also witnessed live snowfall and we have visited 1 spot while going to Solang Valley which is around 4km before from Solang Valley where they asked as to do the activities as the snow is also very good there for activities.We went to Solang Valley and it was continuous snowfall there. What a wonderful and awesome scenario there. Everywhere it's white in color not to forget we have our lunch in Solang Valley. Mutton and Rice it's awesome in taste and super delicious not a big restaurant it's just a small food joint and it's very cheap 150 per plate for Mutton and Rice and our local driver told me he took more from me it only 80 or 100 max for that plate. Anyways, visit Solang Valley for sure to check the snowfall and do some fun activities but keep in mind activities are little costly but you will enjoy for sure."
Absolutely not worth it ,The place is run by cheats. Everything cost a bomb. The zip line is just a 100-200 meters long with no safety and price varies according to their moods. There are more cheats on the way that will cheat you into renting out suits and gloves for a price that is unbelievable. I will never go back again
Good for view and activities!,If you are looking for activities definitely visit solang valley . You will get a great deal after bargaining. The ropeway ride to 3200 meters is also great.
Damn fun,"the day we visited the valley.. had a lot of snow fall... this was the most fun visit in Manali.. we spent almost 3 hrs on this location.the fun activities are bit expensive... but at the end it was worth,.. just be aware of shilajit and kesar sellers,, you will find them throughout the HImanachal."
Good place,This is a good place in november . temple is located on top of it and snow bikes are available to reach there.
Solvang valley,It's a great adventure... So entertaining place..... We enjoying in ice we will come as soon as to visit Solvang Valley.. Thanks
Beautiful place with conmen all around ,"Mind blowing! This is a definite must go but beware of conmen waiting to rip you off. It starts with the rental of snowsuits and shoes then they tell you that you need a guide to take you up. Then when it comes to the activities, each one tries to sell a package at various prices. I don’t understand why can’t there be a designated counter for all the activities so that prices are fixed. One example, I was looking at going on the mountain bike for which one guy quoted INR3,000 while another one offered the same thing for INR1,200. For skiing, one guy said, INR3,500 while another one offered for INR1,500. Sometimes these things can be a put off. This is definitely a place worth going but be very careful with all those conmen out there including your trusted driver who gets a cut from rental outlet he takes you to."
the must visit place,"while visiting manali..the 1 whole day sud b keep for solang valley as there is lots of thing can b do there..para glidding,skimming,horse riding etc and more..they needs time and offcourse money..as nothing free there..but you will enjoy with kids and family..dont cover rohtang pass and sollang valley together as they both need time.."
Excellent place with snow activities,"There are many activities available here, the most exciting to me was paragliding. There’s also skiing and tubing. Around the area, there are old ladies selling hot soup and noodles. It is extremely cold there, I advise anyone going to wear THICK THICK SOCKS, waterproof shoes, and rent a full body ski suit. Also bring gloves and maybe a mask because your face will get very cold."

"How Green Was My Valley! Kumarhatti, Solan Valley, Himachal.","How Green Was My Valley... The early morning drive had no respite from traffic rush even on a gloomy Saturday morning. Bypassing the busy ISBT, it took almost an hour to reach Karnal road, as usual the chaotic Samalkha with mixture of cars, slowly moving tractors filled to the brim with sugarcane, the aggressive roadway buses, it was a fight for survival. Leaving Panipat, the site of the battle of Panipat where the Marathas lost suzerainty over Punjab till north of Sutlej river to the Afghans in 1780s. Soon  the excellent toll road soon took us through beautiful Karnal, the city named after Karan ( Kunti's illegitimate son). The beautiful lake carry a legend that Arjuna  had slain the fallen hero on it's  bank. A few miles more you arrive at Krushetra, the battle ground of Mahabharata, the famed Gita Kunj,  where Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna about meaning of life through verses of  Gita. A few miles into the the ancient land, you arrive at the bank of Daipaiyan Lake where Bhima finally had his revenge on   Duyrudhana, the villain of the epic.  If you walk a few  more  paces, you finally arrive at Bhismasthall, where the great warrior lay on a  bed arrows after Arjuna defeated him. Leaving behind this ancient land, you reach Ambala Cantonment, the vast fertile agricultural land with all kinds of vegetation is a sight to behold, fortunately there was no stubble burning this time. The Himalayan Expressway led us to the historical Pinjore Garden established by the Mughals and then the road slowly  climbs up. And we soon arrive at  the hills, the  air sparkled with pine fragrance, the chill carried the moisture from the far off Snowy Himalayas, the night   poignant  with mountain songs only  you can hear! The dawn finally breaks over silently, the  blue thrush has long migrated to warmer climates, only the bulbuls happily chirped, the mist slowly rose over the valley still swathed in darkness, but the first Sunrays carried the hope of a brilliant day! Happy in my  green hills. Random Musings, Solan, Himachal."
Amazing place,"This is a beautiful place you can have horse rides, Para gliding and even you can go to the top of the mountain in a cable car which is pretty high approx 3000 meters. Atmosphere is very pleasant.Must visit place in Manali"
ENJOYED,Luckily there was snowfall the night before our visit to Salong Valley. One must go upwards through rope way and enjoy. If you have hired a cab then ask the driver to take you right up to the main point or else you have to walk a lot. Thrill of snow biking will be good for some but the view from 3200m height is something more enchanting.
Awesome valley,"Solong valley is just awesome place...there we can do lot of activities like paragliding, biking, jip lining etc...wanna go there again"
"Great place to fo paragliding , zorbing, and other funactivities.","Great place to fo paragliding , zorbing, and other funactivities.  Visited there with group of my friends, One thing to note is para gliding does not happen in all weather."
Breath taking,"It is the valley between many hills and it is truely a breath taking experience to be able to visit. No cams can capture this beauty.. there are lot of things to do here... From playing area to sky cars, 4 wheler bikes, paragliding, or sit and chit with some pakoras or meditate. There are no big shops however and most of the shops are from the indegenious tribals...Try to get a glimpse of there living and surroundings as well. This is a bit above the tourist valley. There is a dumping yard nearby for rocks but it really seems a beauty in itself.. ice definitely. Gotta come with the right outfits (there are shops nearby as well where u can rent out).."
Adventure activities for the family !,"Cars will have to drop you 1-2 kms from the open playground. Drive an ATV or ride the horse upto the open playground. Therafter, paraglide (short -1000/- and long 3200/)-, experience the snow while sitting in ropeway cabin (650/-) ! There are also skiing and other adventure activities happening around. Ther eis also an ATM here - FYI.Overall, this is where you can enjoy the MANALI adventure experience, if not Gulaba (for hiking on a snow mountain)"
Pre snowfall time to solang,"There was some snow here. Can play in snow. Not much freezing at this time. It will be full covered with snow in December. Don't do paragliding here. its very costly and not from any height. Its like a demo only. if u want to do it, go to patlikuhal. It costs around 3000,but its really mind blowing. U can walk to snow point or take a horse ride or ATV. Atv cost rs.1000for 2 single bike(2 people max).walk up to the maximum. There is a springling waterfall at the top which is mesmerizing. But have to remove shoes there."
Scenic mountain view.,"Solang is surrounded by mountains covered with snow from all snow. It's scenic and must visit place in Manali.To do:After you reach the drop point of your vehicle, you have options of snow biking vehicle which cost more than RS.1000/- to reach in no time at the top or  horse ride which is slow journey, but of little adventure and can cost you only RS.200/- per horse depending on your bargaining skills. The way up is bumpy terrain, with stones, so it gives more fun for horse ride. When you reach top there are some eating stalls available, but the mission is the Shiva temple situated on base of one of the mountain. The temple has Shiv-Linga, the snow water falls on the Linga and the snow takes shape of Linga, just like Amarnath. But to mind you after getting down from horse half way up to temple you have to reach the temple with bare foot, seems adventurous!!! But walking bare foot on snow covered snow steps can cause you health problem. People with heart problem, breathing problems advised to avaoid going temple, best to reach the base camp and enjoy Maggi, tea or coffee. The Sun sets on the snow gives a pleasant view here. To come down back you can opt Zipline which is the longest here."
Great visuals,I'm based out in the southern part of India and this was the 1st time i had been in contact with real snow and was really amazing experience.
Enjoy snow in solang,We are planned for 1 day trip of soling valley during our trip to shimla manali .we got fresh snow in solang valley .we enjoyed here n masti with snow.
Solang Valley,"This was the last day of I was staying in Manali. I wanted to experience of doing Paragliding for the first time. There was two types of Paragliding fee structure- one for 1000 Rs and the other for 3000 Rs. Since this is the last day, I was so tight of budget. So I chose the cheaper one. And I did it and it was awesome"
Solang 'The Adventure Valley',"Solang is known as the adventure valley of Manali where you enjoy all sort of activities which will give you an adrenaline rush. You can do Paragliding, Zip lining, Cable car , Motor bike riding etc."
Awesome experience - covered in snow in November ,"The shiv mandir above the valley was covered in snow. You would need a zero degree jacket if you want to climb upto the mandir. You can plan either go by walk, on horse or ATVs to reach the mandir side from the valley. Such a beautiful sight."
must visit place of Manali,you can ride snow scooter to reach to temple at 2 km height of valley...adventures experience of riding on snow scooter.
Its Heaven on earth,if you want to enjoy please be there by 7 am the snow is fresh and the sunlight doesn't hurt you. once the crowd comes the snow gets dirty and there is big traffic on road.
Awesome ,"The paragliding at salong valley was very much exciting. They take you to a height of 10300 feet via a cable car. There had been snowfall already when we visited salong valley. So from the top you could see snow all around. I could not believe my eyes. It seemed that I was somewhere in Europe. Meanwhile all the preparations for the paragliding was done by the attendant.  He asked me to run as fast as I could for the take off. That 30 seconds were a bit scary but after the take off, it was very very enjoyable. The entire ride was approx 8 minutes. I enjoyed every moment of it. Even  the cable car ride was very nice. Myself, my wife and my son, all three of us did paragliding.  It was like a dream come true for us"
Snow covered,"It was a worthwhile trip to that place, loads of snow and paragliding. There are no good places to eat, just some small shops selling Maggi."
Solang Valley - Your adventure dose,"- I would rate it as the best part of my travel itinerary.- Gondola ride will take you to the mountain @650 INR to & Fro- No Costumes available on the hilltop, Rent it when you are at ground or rent one from highway shops @ 250 INR- You can also hire ski set with trainer - There is a restaurant at the hilltop, food is pathetic and expensive.- No food items allowed inside Gondola Ride.- Take proper waterproof suit on rent if you want to roll in the snow, else normal clothes work but it may get wet.- If you want to Para Gliding ticket is @ 3200 INR which includes yours and Pilot's gondola ticket and paragliding charge.- NOTE: If you want to spend some time at Hilltop before paragliding asks them, else you won't get time and pilot will ask you to glide immediately. Best approach is to take his number and call him once you are ready on the hilltop."
Amazing ,"I think all indian should visit once in the life the place is beautiful and awesome nature ,  sometimes there is snowfall if you are lucky. You will never fill bored and you will enjoy most then any other place ..."
Exciting time at Solang Valley,"Solang Valley is near Manali , on the way to Rohtang Pass. It is known for Summer and Winter Sport.After coming back from Gulaba, we went to Solang Valley. The place is known for Paragliding , Ski , ATV rides , Zip line and Ropeway. There are food stalls selling hot food , corn , tea, coffee, etc. It is an expensive place to enjoy. An ATV ride can cost you Rs. 1000 for 2 people and a Ropeway ride can cost you Rs. 650 per person. You can also do a Horse ride Cost aside, it's fun to take a ride on an ATV and Ropeway. If you are looking to do adventure sports and a few rides , head straight to Solang Valley."
Ultimate View,it was a unforgettable moments in solang velly with entire family. wehad lots of fun and activities.
Must visit if you come to manali,"If you want less crowd, do plan to visit on Tuesday since Rohtang is closed on Tuesday and you won't find traffic or busy roads.Views are too good from on the way itself upto solang.Must visit"
Lovely view,It was a very lovely view. We rode mountain bikes on five km up and down trip on bumpy Road with stones. Saw people paragliding and enjoying zip line rope way. Had nice hot Pakoras and tea at roadside tea stall. People very hospitable and nice
It was very amazing trip with Himalayan trips LLP,"Well I was having some other thought about my trip, but I already booked a package for Himachal with Himalayan trips LLP. My trip is about to start in several months. I was little bit confused about it, as I’m traveling first time to Himachal Pradesh. Today morning I had call with AJINKYA who is my travel expert, this guy sorted out all my confusions which I had before my trip. He shared some screenshot of his google reviews. So I came here to cross-check that and couldn’t stopped myself to write my own review before trip."
Breathtaking views!!!,"If you come to manali make solang valley a must place to visit. There are a lot of activities such as: paragliding, River crossing etc. And the views of the Mighty himalayas are breathtaking. "
Solang Valley--Enjoy the Nature,"Solang Valley, which lies on the Western bank of Beas River, Manali,  is a side valley at the top of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh.   It is about 14 kms  from Manali on way to Rohtang Pass.   Solang Valley is famous for its Summer and Winter sports. The sports that are…"
Nice place to visit with family,I had visited in the summers but still nice place to visit. Nice activities around the place and good view from the top if you visited the top with cable car. Cable car was bit expensive but worth to try.
Vacations ,"I visited this place in the month of 4th June 2018 & it was like heaven on Earth, mesmerized by it's beauty, feeling can't be explained in words. A must visit place for all mountain lovers & if your are not able to go to rohtang pass bcoz of snow & road blocks,this valley will…"
Place for adventure and sports ,"If you're looking for adventure and sports then it's solang. I suggest you to visit this place in winter because it's snowy in winter and as such there is no scenic beauty except sports such as paragliding,riding scooter and ropeway. Well for paragliding,there are two options…"
A place for youngsters,Solang Valley is all about adventure sports. It is a nice place to visit even if you are not interested in the myriad activities that will come your way. You can paraglide. There are different kinds of rides available (with or without snow). Then there is the ropeway which takes you up to a viewpoint which gives you a lovely view of the peaks nearby (but the ride is not cheap). This is worth an afternoon.
Solang - Good for beginners,"If you're looking for a convenient location for winter sport, Solang is great. It's about an hour from Manali, and is a huge open meadow with slopes around it. In summer, you'll find tourists zorbing and paragliding here, and in winter, they're trying out skiing and snow activities. However, because it's easy to get to, you'll find it full of tourists. There is rubbish on the ground - chip packets, cigarette butts, soft drink cartons, etc - and the snow is usually trodden on and mucky. In addition, many of the operators are not certified to conduct the sports, so their equipment may not be checked regularly. If you are looking for a snowy experience, you'd be better off going on a snow trek. Once you're in the mountains, you can explore the pristine snow as much as you like, and enjoy some peace and quiet. If you want to try skiing, head to Auli (Uttarakhand) or Kashmir instead. Auli has great slopes (lots of travellers from around the world come here for skiing), and even a fabulous cable car ride."
Waste of time and money,"It takes around an hour to reach solang from manali, the view from the rope way were not great and the charges 650 were like too high (not worth).The valley itself was not in good shape, probably in winters things might change but definitly a no go when it doesnt snow. As for para gliding again the flight is of 3min which is not worth for 1000-2000bucks."
Solang Trip,"Probably, I was not at this place at the right time. The place was all in ruins with dirt and stones dug up from construction site at Rohtang tunnel."
Half day can be spent here. Various activities,"Activities include 4 wheel bike ride, though not cheap. Near by when thre is no snow you can do paragliding and that's about it. The area itself is worth exploring. Rocky, some trails, a river near by and that's it."
Useless and complete waste of time,"Coming to Manali for the first time during the Dessert break, we drove down from Gurgaon in our SUV. Amongst all the sightseeing we did, the worst was Solang Valley / Nullah. Not because of harassment by anyone, but at the time we went it was a sheer lack of activities and absolutely nothing worth seeing or doing. Let me break it down by things we did / observed:Ropeway / Cablecar - This was the most disappointing. Costing 650pp we expecting great views, unfortunately the car doesn't go to the very top but kind of ends abruptly Midway. There is a restaurant on the top selling unhygienic food / tea etc. Small paths take you around the mountain, but no proper path or any kind or railing to provide support or protection. You are on your own. There is a loo there which was Ok. They have a paragliding jump-off point there, but the cost is 3200 which I found quite steep compared to Rohtang pass  similar activities. If there is no snow my recommendation is to don't bother.Paragliding: There are two options 1000/3200. Did the 1000 one, but be ready to trek up some distance. As with paragliding once you are up in the air it's fun as the cool breeze hits your face. The instructor is a local and really was knowledgeable and good at what he does. However as I mentioned, doing this on your way back from Rohtang Pass would be a better treat. For the 3200 one you need to take the Cablecar up the side of the mountain. The price includes the ride up.ATV: Sorry, but didn't really get what is the point of riding if you can't drive. Besides the concept of ATV is 'all terrain' all they did was go up and down a road. Skipped.Some shops and food stalls - as expected, filthy.That's it, that's Solang Valley / Nullah for you."
"River, mountains, temple","If you have done Rohtang pass then you can definitely skip this. This is nothing compared to Rohtang pass. More over there are these ATV riders and horse men to annoy you to take you to the top. ATV riders demand 1200/- but can fix it for 800/- Since we'd kids we had to opt for the ATV!! But the fact is it's wakable distance to the top. There is also the option of rope way. It's a nice place up there...view of the flowing river, a Small cozy temple. A slow trek with breath taking views is recommended."
Lots of sports,"Amazing place, which has lots of sports paragliding, snow ride, ice skating etc. If you are visiting Manali you have to visit this place."
Place where you can enjoy some adventure activity,Done paragliding. Nice experience. Would like to suggest people to have it. Place to relax. Worth half a day visit.
Closed due to lack of customers,Ski Himalayas stopped Ropeway because there were only few guests. Claiming power supply was unavailable.
Best place to enjoy leisure time and visit gandola and shiv mandir,This place is awesome and let you to reach shivay mandir where water is falling on the shiv link continuously and the view is really awesome.
Solang valley Manali review,Soang Valley  is  dirty place. Horses are spreading dirt around them. Government is not trying to improve this area
Great place for adventure activities,We stopped her for paragliding. If you come all the way to Manali from wherever you are coming from then paragliding is a must. The people are very professional and wait for the right conditions before taking off. I had a good time.
It was ok,This is quite overrated place. I would suggest Hampta pass if you are looking for an amazing view. The paragliding here is from short distance. Overall it was an ok place
Very Good Place,Solang Valley is very good place. There are a wide variety of activities and adventure sports. Must visit here.
Dont spend here!!!,"This is an average place to be visited. It is full of tourism scammers. Firsty, when u enter, they will convince you to take ATV which will cost about 1000/- The ATV will take u near a temple, which is not something new or great. So this can be skipped.After finishing the ATV tour, we were dropped at the actual Solang valley spot, which later we realised we could have walked. So they literally scammed us for this.Then, we took the cable car/ropeway to the hill, which we realised was nothing to do. We just took a few photos & came down, for which we spent 1300/- Another waste.All in all, go here when it snows to enjoy the activities.DONT BE SCAMMED!!"
It was Ok and not so great,"The place was OK Ok. The activities are too costly. If you think to spend whole day, then it's not for you"
most freaking view of Himachal ,Solang valley is pure beauty . But but visit this place in winters which addd double beauty to this place . I went in september so there was no snow but every time is an experience so it was good . There are many sporting activites which take place during winters so i am sure planning for december . Coming to the viewss are just so beautiful . I saw on Google exactly the same view but i was little dissapointed not to witness the snow . But there is always next time so yeah .. There is a waterfall name Anjani mahadev waterfall which is also a must visit place when you visit solang valley ..
Snow and green,Snow capped mountain. But ropeway was good. It cost 750 rupees but it was good to paid. Lovely view.
Worth a visit!,"It was March when we visited Manali and had no plans to visit Solang valley, as we had rohtand pas in our mind, howver night before we planned, Manali had snowfall whole night  and seriously Solang became the best place in Manali"
Breathtaking view,"Post visit of Hidimba Temple, we reached Solang Valley. There,we  can enjoy paragliding but we prefer to take the ride in Cable car and went on top of hill. The view from there was amazing and breathtaking. We stayed there for 3-4 hours and enjoyed some snacks in Cafe over there."
It was Memorable Trip I ever Had ,They day we reached Solang Adventure start it was our First Trekking from Manali to Solan Valley. We stayed there for approx 5 Days and cover all around sight seeing and Green Fields even we trekked to Paragliding Point which is around 2Km from Valley it was fun visiting.
Best in Manali,Solang valley is the best place in Manali. Its must watch .. Though i went in Sep there was no snow but the beauti of the nature is mesmerising .. Adventure sports .. temples.. waterfalls..ropeways.. horse riding ..everything is in there. And lot of guys comming to you for selling saffon ..
Solang Valley (Manali),"This place offers you with a lot of adventure options. Cable car ropeway, Paragliding and during snow offers skiing as well. Located at a distance of 30 kms from Manali Main market, you can reach on bike, car or mini van. This place gets amazing during months of Jan and Feb when the snow clad mountains can easily be seen."
Excellent place and alternative to Rotant Pass,"It was a pleasant experience for us when we visited this place back in 2014. We were wanting to go to Rohtang Pass but due to snow and weather it was closed till end of June. hence, we visited Solang Valley. To our surprise this place was good enough for us and we really enjoyed the place."
Awesome place,"We visited Solang Valley in February, ar that time this area was full of snow. Although Rohtang pass was closed. Me, my wife and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed parachute jumping. There are two different valley points one is very high and one is less high, You can choose one point for parachute jumping. The charges for very high point at that time were approx 2k per person which includes to and fro fare of rope way. Another hill was lesser in height for which you will have to walk to reach the point by yourself, the charges were Rs 700 per person. One person will accompany you to handle parachute during jump. If you want photo/video of your jump, there are persons who shoot all the jumps taking their turns for different customers. But they asked for Rs 300 for each person's video and Rs 300 for photo, soft copy only. Keeping somebody for making your video can help but it would be difficult to identify which one to  shoot because there are so many jumps happening one by one. One has to be extra alert and must have good camera which can shoot from distance. Some other enjoymemts can be ice skating, ice scooter etc. If you ask a professional to take photos while playing in the snow, the guy will deliver it to your hotel also. The charge for the dress and shoes to wear while going to the valley was Rs 300 per person. You can also enjoy juices,shakes and snacks in the cafeteria."
Sublime natural beauty with breathtaking views,"This is the best place I liked in and around Manali. The towering mountains, pine scented air, roaring waterfall and backdrop view of cloud studded peaks with snow is jaw-dropping. You can get yourself clicked with this beauty or enjoy some recreational activities like zorbing, zip line, etc. I went in September so there was no snow. However, the best time to visit this place with snow from November to March."
Beware with cab drivers,The cab drivers running between Delhi Shimla Manali are over experienced and they will stop only at places where they have tie up for money in the form of commission.it continues with restaurant water sports horse riding everything.worst experience with our cab drivers
One of Must visit place in manali,This is one of the must visited place in manali. You can enjoy winter sports. When we reach in june very little snow was there.
Ropeway view from the top,"In the top of the Solang Valley we felt that we are in the top of the heaven. Cool breeze, green trees, snow and Maggie at the top were the highlights."
Best ropeway I have ever travelled,It was the ropeway which attracts me very much. It was some costly but worth. View was nice. Very little snow were on the peak and it was muddy. But snow scooter driving was awesome. View was picturious.
A must visit,"The place is know for two things, Shiv Lingam (Anjani Mahadev Temple) & Winter Sports. After much contemplation we decided first to go and see the Shiv Temple which was situated at a height and could be reached only by foot or on a horse back. And we opted to ho on ‘foot’ (only to experience worst ever foot pain at night). After many breathless steps, unlimited halts, slip offs, blame game, water gulping and against all odds, finally we reached the point where we saw Ice covered Shiv Limgam and water turned ice falling on It. It was one of the most beautiful sites to watch with mountains and tress in the surrounding and frozen trail of water falling from the top of a stone peak. Thus, made me realize the main reason for this place being a magnet for the tourists. A cup of tea and a bowl of maggi pumped up our energy to go down the same height that we had climbed and experience people enjoying the winter sports. A little walk (once we climbed down the track) is an area dedicated to Winter Sports. Paragliding, Skiing are few sports which are the main sports attraction of this place and people take part in it whole-heartedly. This is one of the most vibrant and enjoyable places in Manali and should not be missed."
an hour drive from manali,"its like an hour drive from manali. i visited this place in august, so there was no snow and after Rohtang pass, that is why this place did not seem that attractive to me. there is a theme park. i took cable car ride from here, it was not cheap and view from the top was also disappointing. i saw ppl taking pony rides here and there are many food courts here and also has public parking and WC."
Awesome trip,"This valley is well known for its adventure activities like paragliding, skiing etc. We went for skiing early in the morning. Since we were very early so we got the whole skiing arena to ourselves. We had the time of our lives while skiing. We skied for close to 45 mins. The guide we got was so helpful and friendly. he also acted as our photographer :) this place is awesome"
Must place to Visit in Manali,"Must place to Visit in Manali. Lot of activities that you can do here like skiing, paragliding etc. Over crowded at times but must visit place"
Fun activities ,"It is a fun filled place with lots of activities like skiing , paragliding etc . We were lucky that it had snowed the day before we went. Make sure to support the local population by having tea and other snacks in the small shops."
Solang Nala,"It is a among the well known valleys of Manali. The time we visited, der was no snow fall. So we went climbing till the end. There is temple of lord shiv on the top. Couple of food stalls, water ponds to enjoy for. Pleasant weather with Natural Air.There are many adventure things to do, such as  paragliding, sketing. But make sure u do a proper bargening with them before doing it. Some hawkers & local Boys try selling Kesar here, by promising & proving that the product is origina & imported & make people buy with huge prices.So make sure u dont come in such frauds.Try keeping so needed essentials with u, such as snacks & water to avoid der huge mrps."
Overcrowded in May,Nice place and views.  the cable car was nice.  But very crowded.  could not do any adventure activities
Best Place....,"Yet another place ,,, so beautiful and picturesque that all one needs is just stay day and dream.. We hired two bikes which was worth the trip up, as the line of traffic was horrible. But by bikes it was so easy that you could just slip  your way up. the food is not that great only noodles.. but we did drink a lot of tea to keep our self warm."
Himalayan Beauty,What an amazing experience of Himalayan range. Drizzling clouds scenic view above the clouds from cable car. An adventures ride on mountain biking an horse riding all make it a wonderful excursion from Manali.
Best place in Manali,"One must visit this place with 2/3 hours time. Take rope way ride though costly. Restaurant above is not that good, but have clean toilets, and may roam around for quite windy with view of surrounding valley and Manali. Some may go for sports activities also."
Too Good,"It is a must visit place. Beautiful ropeway , beautiful scenic beauty. The drive from Manali to Solang Valley is mesmerising. Lots of activities can be done at Solang Valley. Don't miss out Solang Valley when you visit Manali."
Good Negotiations required for rides ,Go by trekking to shiva temple As we some viewHorse ridding is but expensive Other ride is need negotiation required Lot of middle man involvement
"Paragliding, cable car, shiv Temple visit very nice.","we enjoy on 3rd Jun 2018, 1st we try Paragliding it was costly but enjoy a lot with new experience from height to landing on Earth.Cable care traveling is feeling down to the upside on the mountain with the nice view and  we can get this by hard work of there staff and Manali systems. Near this after 3-4 KM traking we reached Shiv Temple the seen was nice a waterfall on shivling, best experience with good feeling. you should go there..."
Must Visit,"This is main tourist attraction through out the year. Particularly in winter, when Rohtang is closed, this is snow point for all tourists."
