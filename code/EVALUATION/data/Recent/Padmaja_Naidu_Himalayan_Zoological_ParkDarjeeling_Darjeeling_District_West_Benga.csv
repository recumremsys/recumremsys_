A good place,"Nice walk through the zoo and very more options to watch..Few spieces of animals will not be found in other zoo are available here...loved the black leopard. seems like my pet ""Augosto"""
Darjeeling Himalayan Zoo,"Darjeeling Himalayas Zoo is one of the beast places to visit . There is variety of animals and birds.Bengal tiger, Panther, Leopard ,Red Panda, snow leopard , Beer and so many another animals.There is also have 2 museum in this zoo . In the first museum there is a real body of animals.In the second museum there is material that they used 40-50 years ago to go to Mount Everest.If anyone is in Darjeeling, don't miss seeing the Darjeeling Himalayan Zoo."
Pretty good for a zoo,"Inherently, zoos are rather sad places and the animals are not happy. As far the Himalayan Zoological park is concerned, it's mostly well maintained, the animals have some space to move around, and there is community support from Darjeeling.Preserving the differing Himalayan animal species is a worthy cause and I supported this endeavor by visiting. It's never going to be perfect, but it is nice to see some of the native animals that  survive man's encroachment of the nearby environment.This zoo is definitely worth a couple hours of your time and the Red Panda display is always pretty lively and fun. It's also nice to see full grown native trees in the animal enclosures ....since a lot of India in this area has been deforested for decades."
Nature and its beauty,Not a very very big place.But saw many animals including Bengal Tiger which were rare.Very natural habitat and enclosures for animals.Vey neat and clean and well organized.Good walking with many inclines but not difficult.
Not just a zoo,"It might make you say ""Zoo? who goes to a zoo on a holiday?"" but this zoological park was way more amazing than I expected. It's the zoo which actually had most of the animals they have mentioned there. And, as i said, it's not just the zoo but also the HImalyan Mountaineering Institute. So if you wanna explore the history of mountaineering and some great summits till date, you can explore the institute, which is included in the zoo ticket. So if you're in Darjeeling for any length of time, do go to this park and you won't regret it."
must visit,I have been to a number of zoos . This zoo clearly keeps animal in great enclosures. Cages are not crowded. Animals seem to be in good health . It has a lot of rare animals . Must visit
A must visit place,"This is probably the fourth time I have visited this zoo. The rare species of Himalayan animals have been kept with proper care. The kids and teens of our family enjoyed a lot. The Yak, Takin, Himalayan Wolf, Red Panda and varieties of birds and reptiles have kept with great care. A must visit place for the travellers."
Preserving Himalayan Species,"Established on spare land of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, the role of this Zoo in breeding and re-establishing colonies of Himalayan animal species is invaluable. Species on display include the Bengal Tiger, Snow Leopard, Clouded Leopard, Himalayan Wolf, Jackal, Black Bear and Red Panda, plus many deer and mountain goat varieties."
Worthy to visit,"This is one of the must see place in Darjeeling. This Zoological Park hosts a variety of high altitude, particularly local species, which includes some rare animals like Clouded Leopard, Black Leopard, Himalayan Wolf, Thar, Blue Sheep etc. Beside that, the main attraction is Red Panda, which are seen in plenty at separate enclosure imitating their natural habitation.The place is well maintained & clean. The road side signages are appeared friendly while visiting the different part of the zoo. A museum on local flora & fauna is there showing replica eco-system of high & mid altitude hills & its base area. Some lively models & stuffed animal figures are kept there, which altogether worth a visit. The famous Himalayan Mountaining Institute also situated within the same campus & can be visited on same ticket@ Rs. 30 per person. The place is little away from the city centre/ Darjeeling Mall, but is nearer to Darjeeling Ropeway. One can plan accordingly to visit both the place together, which may take at least half of a day (depending upon the rush at Ropeway). As the zoo remains open from 9 AM (except Thursday), it would be better to visit this place first at morning (which may take 3 hrs including HMI) & then go for Ropeway.NB. I still remember a big Siberian Tiger as saw during my last visit to this place at about 15 years back. This time, I saw a Royal Bengal Tiger, but sadly missed that."
A zoo that you must visit.,"It is one of the best zoos that I have seen. It houses the Red Panda, the Snow Leopard, the Clouded Leopard, a Royal Bengal Tiger apart from the variety of deer, bears, langurs, civets, sloths and a variety of birds. We also saw a black panther this time in February 2020. There are a few colourful macaws that the zoo has acquired, which are quite brilliant. But what takes my breath away are the himalayan pheasants that one gets to see, especially the Monal pheasant, which is one of the most beautiful birds on the planet. The walk to the zoo from the Mall, is one of the best mountain town walks that you are likely to find anywhere on earth. The walk along Birch Hill Road is an added attraction to visit the zoo."
Animals appear healthy ,Animals appear well cared for compared to other Zoo's i have visited in India. Its quite a sttep incline for anyone less physically able. It was a dull day so many of the were under shelter or in hibernation as colder time of year .
Padmaja Naidu Park,"Good park to visit you can see white lepord, back panther, red panda, Bengal Tiger and many other animals zoo is maontained in very good condition."
Loved the red panda,"We've generally avoided zoos - especially after that horrible establishment in Trivandrum.  This zoo has beautiful gardens, it's peaceful and it was quite exciting to be able to come fairly close to a rather relaxed big tiger. Captivated by the red panda and the indoor display was well worth investigating."
Zoo visit,A rarity of animals as well as endangered species are a main attraction of this zoo and provides refreshment.
Nice Zoo,It's a good local attraction in Darjeeling. A variety of animals are there including Red Panda and various kind of snakes etc. Around 2 Hours are enough to visit it.
Visit it for the Pandas!,We visited the zoo only to see the red pandas but ended up seeing all the animals and it was amazing.Red pandas are really solitude loving lazy animals.They were mostly sleeping or moving real slow from one branch of the tree to the other and we just loved them.Its overall a good visit.
Must visit for animal lovers and also to understand Himalayan ranges,"This visit was totally unplanned but it was a great visit. We were able to see royal Bengal tiger. Zoo is so well maintained and so clean Bombay should learn from this zoo. There are many other animals like snow leopard, wolf. There's also mountaineering institute which is very beautifully planned and shows history of expedition and also the whole Himalayan range. There is replica of ranges. Worth visiting."
Great location sad animals,"I’d heard so much about the zoo, especially given the success of the snow leopard breeding program. With that in mind, the zoo was a huge disappointment. I liked the location, but the animals appeared stressed, and were continuously pacing back and forth, which I know is a terrible sign. The management seemed unable to control the rather unruly crowds, and some of the pens had a fowl stench of urine. We left with a very bad taste of the whole experience."
Well-maintained and must visit place,What a beautifully maintained enclosure for animals unlike Delhi zoo. The animals here look healthy and their lush green abode is admirable. A must visit whenever in Darjeeling.
Small but nice,"Not too many animals but got few rare species like the snow leopard, wolves, yak besides other. Himalayan bear was not there though the marking was there."
Nice zoo to visit,We visited this zoo while in Darjeeling and enjoyed the animal they had. Amazing price for a zoo coming from American prices.
Really felt sorry for the leopards,"Although there is a fair bit to see here, the condition of the cages for the leopards and panthers is really heart breaking, the animals look sad and bored, the cages for the leopards are so small."
Day visit ,"I visit the zoological park whilst in Darjeeling, there was a good number of animals native to India and I was surprised to see the big cats out sunning themselves instead of hiding away.There is plenty to see and the mountaineering institute is a bonus.I would definitely recommend a visit."
Enjoyed the visit for the the unusual animals,It's a nice walk out of Darjeeling to the zoo along the Mall.  The zoo is quite well organised inside and easy to navigate.  The animals are Himalayan mainly so for us from Europe it was an unusual selection including a Yak and wolves.  The birds were also amazingly colourful and not species we normally see.  The only downside is that the Indian visitors seem to have no respect for the animals and make so much noise around them.
A good clean zoo,A nice clean zoo with a good range of animals. Liked the visit as a family. Probably one of the best places to visit in Darjeeling which is unsatisfactory as a place.
Excellent Zoo,My toddler enjoyed the zoo; 1-2 hours is enough to spend time here. You can see big bengal tigers; snow leopard; natural museum inside the zoo is interesting as well
Amazing,"Liked it a lot,worth visiting if u come to Darjeeling,could see big cats from such close distance ,the name was not appealing me but just for sake went and liked it"
Good,"Great experience, lot to walk. Truly amazing, Red panda, bear etc, it's worth visiting. Neat and maintained well"
Must visit to watch the rare Himalayan fauna,"It was a long term wish to visit the place primarily to watch the Red Pandas and Snow Leopard. The collection includes other Himalayan & cross Continental Avi-fauna. Notables are - Clouded Leopard, Black leopard, Himalayan Tahr, Himalayan Wolf, Blue Sheep, Mishmi Takin, Temmincks Tragopan, Golden Pheasant etc."
Exciting visit,"This zoo contains some exotic animals which are endangered. Red Panda, Snow Leopard, Snow wolf, barking deer,etc. It was a great experience."
A Zoo Atop The Hills,The Zoo has very good collection of animals. Especially it is known for Red Panda and Snow Leopard. The Zoo is very clean. The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute and Bengal Natural History Museum are also located inside the premises.
Very good,Good place to visit and good collections at the museum and well maintained zoological park. Must visit place.
"Excellent small zoo, good enclosures for animals","A collection of mountain ungulates and big cats of The Himalaya, with spacious enclosures for animals, and a nice easy walk for visitors, who can also see labelled trees. Adjacent to the equally interesting Himalayan Mountaineering Institute."
Day trip at Darjeeling,"Need not to spend too many words to describe a short yet refreshing day trip to #Darjeeling town. At our leisurely pace, we strolled on the curved steep roads leading to Mall, visited the Himalayan Zoological Park, had sumptuous lunch at Glenary's and had some tea tasting sessions before calling it a day."
Unexpected pleasure,Not being fan so of zoos we were uncomfortable at the prospect of seeing animals in cages. Nevertheless they all appeared in good health and well fed. Indeed our surprising conclusion was that the visit reinforced our admiration of wild animals and desire to protect them and their habitats. The HMI was interesting too.
Wonderful place to visit,"Darjeeling zoo is an excellent place to visit. Very well maintained, clean and planned zoo homes beautiful Himalayan animals including Himalayan wolfs, Red Panda, Snow Leopard, Himalayan Tahrs. The list also includes Common and Clouded Leopard, Black Panther and Royal Bengal tiger. Apart from that Monkeys, Beautiful birds, Deer completes it. Very nominal entry fee is required."
Enjoy nature and the animals view,Animals are on their natural habitat(mimic). They seems happy and healthy. You can enjoy nature here beside the view of Himalayan animals.. HMI is also in the same vicinity.Must buy whole spices grown locally available near gate..
Great ,Love this place. Not only kids but the adults also will surely love the place. The animals are kept almost in a natural surrounding. The museum inside is also very informative. Worth a visit. Remains closed on thursdays.
Short outing,"Highlight of the visit, the RED PANDA, state animal of Sikkim.Must visit for families with kids. Good education and entertaining experience for all age groups"
Worth a visit,The Zoo is located inside the HMI Campus in Darjeeling. The Campus itself is in close proximity to Darjeeling Taxi stand. It has decent no of animals including some Red Pandas kept in small enclosures..If u have small children they will absolutely love this place. There is a small Museum inside the campus which covers much of mountaineering history of India including some wonderful newspaper cuttings and photographs. One can also watch a movie on mountaineering in India but show timings need to be confirmed. There is a small cafe inside for snacks and tea and a shop for souvenirs..Overall a good experienceHappy Travelling
Local flora and fauna ,This zoo housed inside HMI has all the Himalayan wildlife found in eastern Himalayas. One gets to see the wildlife from close quarters
Very well maintained and interesting,"This place was a gem in Darjeeling. The animals appear well cared for, and there are a range of species that are native to the Himalayas. The site is well maintained, definitely worth a visit."
Best place to see local animals,You get to see the animals of the Himalayas in this small zoo. Mostly in cages unfortunately but not the usual inhabitants of city zoos
Amazing park and nearly all animals there,Great park just the right distance and walkable. The wardens enforce the no silence board correctly so no catcalls like seen at gangtok. This is the best park in NE
Red pandas,The best attraction of this place obviously the red pandas rare species and beautiful and endangered and another my favorite are Himalayan wolves.. But security needs to be more tighten around enclosures because people are inconsiderate towards animals they are loud and obnoxious around this animals specially around somewhat open enclosures
One of the best zoo ever visited,"I have visited many Zoological parks but this one stands out. Such a well maintained park. There is a Black Panther, Red Panda, RBT etc. children will definitely love it."
Children will enjoy,Not a spectacular place but still you can spend two hours happily with your family.  With not much places to visit in Darjeeling this is an ideal place .  A mini zoo with good scenic environment you can make a visit. Elders will find it difficult to climb the steep road
Worth visiting,"Worth visiting this place, especially red pandas. 😊 Try to avoid going in the noon, as most of the animals are resting."
2 in 1 - Zoo + Mountaineering Institute,Worth a watch. Greenary. Preserved and maintained really well. You have an option to do indoor mountaineering at just 30rs per head. Museum and shows are a bit time consuming.
Worth a visit,"If you have 2 full days in darjeeling, this is a nice visit, the trees surrounding thus zoo is a sight by itself for botany lovers. All Himalayan animals are housed here, only disappointment was not seeing Bengal tiger, but saw snow Leopard, red panda, black panther, yak, and many others."
Red panda only here,A zoo with a difference with a nice variety of species and above all you get to see the red panda with a tail.marvellous
Animals kept in small areas.,As we are used to animal welfare we thought the cages were far too small for the animals and the areas looked tired and well worn but I am sure they do their best with limited resources. Toilet facilities disgraceful for western women visitors!
A special Zoo,I visit lots of Zoo but this one is special for a number of reasonsIn no particular orderIt specialises on animals from the Indian and near Indian regions so you will see lots of animals you will not normally see in zoos elsewhere in the world.The animals have a setting which is special..I get the impression the Zoo and the local botanic gardens are combined and this provides a special environment for the animals..often akin to their natural environmentThe animals are all in extremely good condition which means they are well cared for in every respectAn uplifting place to visit
Beautiful and peaceful zoo,We enjoyed it thoroughly as i had my 2.5 yr old daughter with me...its  filled with steep roads and it was little tiring for me but the environment inside was awesome..we visited the cafe inside the mountaneering institute and had mouthwatering momos..!
Good for kids.,The main attraction is the red panda which is very hard to spot in the wild. The place have almost all the animals found in the Himalayan region. The Bengal tiger the snow leopard even exotic birds. The kids love to be here.
Nice little zoo!,"Interesting place! Was excited to see a Snow Leopard & a Bengal Tiger for the first time (of which there is one of each), although it kills me to see these amazing creatures in captivity. Good selection of animals who look good so it seems they are looked after.The one annoying thing about the zoo is the staff set at dedicated points holding up signs saying 'Silence', yet everyone around them was running around screaming, taking selfies etc. Not really sure what the purpose of these staff's job is, of everyone is just ignoring them? Some discipline would help this zoo a lot. Same goes for forcing people to dispose of their waste properly."
A must visit,"If you are Darjeeling, then a visit to the zoological park n the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute should be a must."
"Simply Amazing,","I had such an amazing time here honestly speaking it is one of the best zoo's in India, it is well preserved and greatly located next to tea garden and rope way which make this place even better. There is something for everyone so many species of animals and for first time i saw Red Panda & Snow Leopard which was an experience i can describe. There was Indian Mountain Institute where you can learn about different Mountain,Rocks,Soil,Climate and more, the best was i did rock climbing which was my highlight of that day, In museum you can see mountains at a small scale replica which was stunning."
A Zoo on a Hill,"Our driver and guide thought it best to drive to the zoo even though it was quite close. The traffic was dreadful it would have been quicker to walk as most attactions in this dirty, rude horrible place called Darjeeling. Our guide decided to allow us to walk after about 1 hour of sitting in the traffic. The Zoo from this spot was about 7min uphill.Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park is quite small and is right in the centre of Darjeeling. The zoo was opened in 1958, and an average elevation of 2,134 m, is the largest high altitude zoo in India. It specializes in breeding animals adapted to alpine conditions, and has successful captive breeding programs for the snow leopard, the critically endangered Himalayan wolf and the red panda. The zoo attracts about 300,000 visitors every year. The zoo serves as the central hub for Central Zoo Authority of India's red panda program.As we had been stuck in traffic for so long we did not have that much time at the zoo so wandered around for 30min and saw the snow Leapod, black bear, red panda, Himalayan wolf and tiger. Even though they are caged they did look quite healthy. Just a shame about the very loud Indian tourists shouting at each other in conversation even though the signs around the park say ""Silence""I would recommend the zoo but walk do not drive if you are within walking distance."
Himalayan species special...,"1. Small and well organized, don't have to walk too much...2. There some animals and birds such as red panda, snow leopard, wild goats, yaks etc which cannot be found in any other zoo...3. HMI is situated inside the campus with a museum on various expeditions mountain climbing...A must visit place..."
Zoo,We visited zoo on 29th Sep.Neat and clean.Well kept variety of animals.A very memorable experience..
Zoo in Darjeeling,"Wonderful Zoo. The Chinese Pandas are added attraction. Otherwise, it is like any other zoo. Only on interest, a person can visit. Children may enjoy."
"Neat and clean zoo, needs about 1-2 hours time.","Very well structured infrastructure; wild animals kept sequentially.   I read reviews which said public transport in form of dedicated shared carts can be availed to the site, I hunted around and discovered as of August 2019 it has been discontinued.A cab from hotel can be booked or if you can find the way around, you can be guided by locals how to avail the shared local transport. This enroute to other places will drop at the site. The local transport it cheap but it just drops to the foot of the uphill zoo and a walk with small kids could be detrimental. A booked cab will cost more but waits for the slotted time. 'Pessimists' wrote reviews of ill conditions animals were kept in ...caged, not fed properly etc. One even said the animals looked sad ...hahahaha as if the visitors were expert reading animal emotions. And my question to them ..why did you visit in the first place then ? Or were you expecting wild animals to roam around arms in arms with humans in a zoo. Certainly it is not the size of what one would see in an international zoo but short and sweet place to visit. And they certainly are not kept in inhuman conditions, they are well fed and breeding also takes place to ensure continuity.My kids really enjoyed and it was quiet informative as well. I'm told the Gangtok zoo is better ...maybe next time...as for this we did not have any complaints.   Kids !! Don't forget to collect your postcards depicting the animals at the entrance after the visit."
Nice experience,"Good place to visit with family and kids.They have various varieties of birds and animals which we generally watch only on TV.They have Black panther , snow leopard , bear , wolves and dont miss out The Bengal Tiger.Place has a museum where they have kept small soveniers of different mount everest expeditions.Good time pass."
zoo,there are so many types of animals are there and so much wide area it is. in this zoo there are so many department like science and army and so nice place
Best Zoo I Ever Visited,Well organised and very neat and clean zoo I ever saw.It doesn't cover much area but it is very well maintained.Overall very good experience.
Best Zoo in India,My father adopted Bird's here in my birthday and my elder brother birthday as a birthday gift and we visited here often because we like these animals very much and the zoo keepers are really take care of these animals.
Excellent and Very Good ,"Best tourist spot in Darjeeling Town, all types of birds and animals of Himalayan Mountain they keep here very carefully."
Well maintained Zoo,"Highly maintained Zoo...One can see Red Panda( most sought after) other than snow leopard... children enjoys a lot...also do try ""local dress"" at the main gate after entering...he will give you picture of yours in local gorkha style..."
Place of Clouded leopard and Red Panda,"It is very spacious, unlike Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, very well maintained, and houses some unique species, some are even highly endangered."
Very few animals and very few birds ,"Charges is too high and its not worth as per me. We walked so much but there are only red pandas, snakes and monkeys. Bear is there but security guys are not helpful and they are not letting anyone know whether the animals are coming or no and also they should tell us that whwre should we go to see the animals. Very high entry charge. Its not worth. As per the animals the charges should be less."
Very clean and interesting fauna species,"The zoo is clean, organized, and well maintained. The highlights, for me, were the red pandas and the snow leopard. The black panther and yaks were the other highlights. Options for food are quite limited. The overly sweet, milky tea is ironical considering this is Darjeeling!"
Zoo at Darjeeling,"Overall experience was good, especially kids would enjoy at this zoo. Various carnivores and herbivores could be seen there. Two Red Pandas were the star attraction. Though it was monsoon, but luckily there was no rain that day. Worth a visit.Natural history museum needs renovation and maintenance."
Red Pandaaaa,We were so excited to see the Red Pandas....that was the highlight for us ...all the other animals were of course beautiful ...but it was a great experience even for us adults!!!
Don't miss the snow leopards,"I wasn't very keen on visiting another zoo and wouldn't have gone if it wasn't on the way for the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. But the snow leopards they have are such majestic creatures. That made the visit totally worth it. I couldn't spot the bengal tiger, but I had seen it earlier. The rest could be fun for young children, like any other zoo."
Great place,"A great place and well maintained zoo. It is a place in the must go list if you have kids in the touring party. A nice collection of animals are conserved in a very good way. We had a nice opportunity for photographs of the Bear, Tiger, Red Panda."
Must visit,A must visit place for iconic museums and HMA . Offers nice activities n great deal of knowledge for young children.
Nice zoos and well kept ,We visited the zoo in Jun 2019 with children. The favorite animal was the red panda that my children loved. A must see in Darjeeling for its fauna and flora.
Zoological Garden on the Hill,"It is a good place to visit,specially ,if you are with children.All the animals are kept in near natural surroundings.For the first time,we saw 'Red Panda"" and ""Snow Leopard"" here."
high altitude amazing Himalayan animals and some endangered species,"Visiting this place was on my priority becuase at this plac only i got a chance to view the rare wildlife of Himalayas. Other zoo’s in India do not have this wildlife due to the climatic conditions they require. This is the place where i foundf the high altitude amazing Himalayan animals and some endangered species that are rarely seen anywhere else in the world. In India, this is the largest high altitude zoo. Got a chance to see Red Panda, Snow Leopard, Cloud Leopard,Blue Sheep, Barking Deer, Himalayan Wolf etc."
Good place to see himalayan animals ,"Amongst the animals present in the zoo I liked Red Panda most. There are different varieties leopards, birds etc. With single entry fee anyone can visit 3 attractions at a time. The zoo, the musium and the HMI"
Zoo n mountaineering,"Mountaineering institute in middle of zoo,all geography,mountains in the area,people who explored, equipment carried definitely good knowledge arena how people struggle.The zoo has many species of birds,reptiles n Royal Bengal tiger.its delight to spend time here. Very gud for families,kids even couples."
Good experience,If one wants to see some of the lesser known species of leopard and panda... it's a must go!!!A lovely quiet winding road leads to the destination and those who enjoy long walks it's a treat!!!
A great place well maintained by the authorities.,"It was a good place to visit. Nicely laid out and with an excellent map for you to follow. Specially for our 2.5 year old son. Many of the animals were the one's he hadnt previously seen. The zoo is well maintained and has good collection of fauna from the himalayan region. The snow leopard, black panther and the red panda are the top attractions. It also has a museum inside. Only problem faced was that its located along a hilltop like most places ariund Darjeeeling. So reaching the entrance was a task. Cars may not always be allowed till the entrance as they block the road sometimes without prior information.But the overall effort of going uphill was worth. P.S. : if senior members are travelling make sure you request the cab driver to drop till the entrance. He may have to again go down from different route and again come to pick u."
Good place for a day teip,My family enjoyed this place. We spend couple of hours here. Go place to explore Himalaya related stuff
Beautiful Experience,"One of the largest high altitude zoo in India. the main attraction The Royal Bengal Tiger, Red Panda, Snow Leopard, Black bear, Himalayan Wolf, Blue sheep and wide varieties of peasants. my only suggestion is you need to walk in a little as the terrain is a bit steep sometimes. Do carry water."
Good,"The zoo is small but has many animals including bear, wolf, bengal (which we could not see),  snow Leopard,  reptiles and few others.  It is always nice to see animals from that close. Inside the zoo we also must visit himalyan Mountaineer Institute and museum. It is total a worth to see this. The zoo bears an entry ticket of Rs. 60/- each. If you are fond of animals you can visit this place."
Families don't miss it for sure !,"If you are someone travelling with young kids then you should miss this place at your own peril! Firstly, you are going to miss it immensely as it is something which nobody really misses when visiting Darjeeling. Secondly, this zoo is not like the ones you may have visited earlier, as it harbours many trees, animals and birds which are related to this habitat. Which just makes the place awesome !The weather when we visited in May, was just amazing to put it modestly. The spread of the Zoo is expansive and nicely landscaped. The collection of animals and birds is large and informative. They also have a museum of natural history in the premises which is also understandably good. The only spoiler is huge crowds with some hordes of undisciplined people hooting and trying to piss off animals. Can you believe this ? But, thanks to this zoo, my children would never forget the Red Panda and I for one, would always know that the national animal of Pakistan is Markhor !! ;-) Needless to remind, which national animal can hunt out Markhor!"
Good collection of animals ,"Good place where you can see Red Panda, Bengal Tiger, Snow Leopard, Black Panther among other animals and birds."
Must visit this Zoo.,"Rare Red Panda,Black Panther,with rare himalayan species under one roof of the. Zoo makes you visit a memorable trip to the city of valleys."
A Nice Kid-Friengly Himalayan Zoo,"Himalayan Mountaineering Institute and the zoo is in same premises, so it’s the same place after all. HMI was established in the honour and memories of the most popular sherpa Tenzing Norgay who assisted Sir Edmund Hillary climbing the Everest for the first time. The HMI Mesuem displays various accessories and items related to mountaineering. If you wish, you can also enroll in a various crash course or long-term courses. Regarding the Zoo, it in-houses a lot of high altitude animals and birds along with popular but rare animals like Snow Leopard, Red Panda, Tibetian Wolf etc. The zoo comprises of various sections for mammals, birds, reptiles and an aquarium for various species of fishes too!"
"Kids enjoyed it, healthy animals, well maintained","Healthy animals, clean well maintained environment, we could see all the animals. Red pandas were the stars. Infact all the animals were. The museum was also very good. very well curated and orgnaized. kids and adults both loved it. worth the visit."
One of the finest zooz,"Lovely Zoo with a lot of animals in an open enclosure.Mostly mountain animals like the black panther,clouded leopards,leopard,himalayan bear,red pands etc."
Great family outing,So this is a place in the hills where you can spend a quality time with your near and dear ones.and the best thing is it has got something for everyone.the only place where you get to see red panda and white leopard.also a variety of birds and animals where children and even adults can enjoy.also the HMI- Himalayan Mountaneering Institute is colocated where you can see Shri Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary feats can b revisited.people will enjoy this place.i have always loved it when you visit this place
best maintained zoo,Kids in our troupe enjoyed the zoo which was maintained at its best. Good way to spend your time at Darjeeling
Must watch if you are with kids!,"It's an amazing Zoo with a great variety of animals. The entry fee is 60/- for Zoo as well as the Mountaineering institute. You enter the gate and you're welcomed by a couple of bears who are cuddling and playing with each other! Such a pleasant sight! There are varieties of wild cats like the Bengal tiger, black panther, Cheetah, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, etc. Many mountain animals like sheep , goats and yaks. They even have a rare red panda which are endangered species. You can even see many beautiful birds. They have places to eat and shop inside. Also neat and clean toilets for our convenience. I would highly recommend this place if you are visiting Darjeeling."
Nice zoo one of the must watch places in Darjeeling ,The zoo is very well planned. You can see animals on both sides of the road/alleyway. There are beaches so you can rest a bit. The star attraction here is the Red Panda.
A good place to take your kids,"This is one of the better zoos I've seen. Most animals seemed to be well; except the cats - the tiger and leopards we saw looked agitated. In fact, the tiger was pacing up and down and it was very disturbing to witness that. The pathways are well marked with arrows for going up and down (though that didn't stop people from going every which way they wanted...like, when will that ever change in our country?) We were able to catch a glimpse of a snoozing red panda and some very majestic wolves. That said, it was pouring when we reached the zoo. I think a couple of stop points/pit stops with a shelter for rain or even a shelter over the already installed benches would be good. There are a few shops selling water, snacks and beverages. There's also a shop where you can hire the Darjeeling's traditional clothes for 50/- and take your own pictures or get their photographer to take a photo and print for you (about 100/- I think). Overall, a good place to go with kids. To stroll around and enjoy the immensely refreshing mountaineous plants and trees that have been beautifully maintained."
Very well maintained zoo with great exihibits,"The red panda was very cute and worth visiting the zoo just to see them.The zoo also has tigers, snow leopards, foxes and wolves.There is a bengal natural history museum with great collection of taxidermied specimens.The climb is a bit steep to see all the exhibits and no battery car is available...so will be difficult for senior citizens and you might have to carry the children..The red panda enclosure is very close to the entrance and that is a plus.Great place for the kids...they loved it...must visit if you are in Darjeeling"
Must visit place for families with young kids,"We visited the park in may 2019, it is very clean and well maintained. All the animals are displayed in open enclosures and only place to see variety of animals from Himalayan ranges, be it snow leopard, black panther, clouded leopard etc...my 3 year daughter enjoyed watching all animals and it was totally worth it !!!"
Good play to visit with kids,"The zoo is spread across a large area and houses variety of Himalayan animals, predators,reptiles and birds. The entry fee is 60/- per person. You would have to walk a lot and Himalayan Mountaineering Institute is also located within its premises. Easily you can spend couple of hours here. The zoo closes at 4pm. The are enough snack and eataries inside. There is a indoor rock climbing activity, HMI museum."
Nicely crafted and maintained zoo park over mountains in Darjleeng,It was memorable experience to visit Padmaja Naidu Himalayan zoo park with family and kids during our tour to Daejleen In May 19.Zoo is Mickey maintained and one could see White Bengal tiger /big Bear and famous Red Panda as attraction to kids
Zoo,Well maintained zoo at high altitudes. Many of those animals won't be available in normal zoos. Worth spending some time with kids and people find interest in associating more with nature.
Well maintained zoo park ,"Must visit when you are in Darjeeling,  bengal tiger, black panther, Himalayan variety sheep's, wolves leapord and so many. Also beautiful animal muesum. Tickets 60 per person"
One time visit ,One can go there if you have small kids. Nice cozy location. Reasonable number of animals. Reasonable price.
Awesome place,"Children will love this place for the red panda, tigers ..etx& also don’t miss the himalayan mountaineering museum"
Great,Wow ..... The animals are not found in other zoos. They have the cutest red panda. Cleanliness is very well maintained.
Wonderful animals but.........,"This is potentially a good zoo. A lot has gone into making animal pens  environmentally authentic for their occupants, but then the ongoing maintenance seems not to have been maintained at a high level. We saw some wonderful mountain animals and birds, but a lot of the animals showed psychological distress in their repetitive actions and pacings. We became a little distressed ourselves watching them.There was little or no evidence of staff around and there needs to be. Despite notices everywhere asking visitors to stay quiet, many of the visitors were very noisy, and frequently trying to goad animals into some action. Many people seemed only interested in their own food and taking selfies - we wanted to shake them and point out the wonders they were looking at.Sadly our visit was rather dispiriting."
One of the best zoo,Amazing zoo with a museum.Great view of animals.Treat to see bengal tiger and red panda.Very neat and clean. Had a great experience.ver well maintained.
Zoo and museum,The zoo was Nice for a short visit.  The museum was  a let down. A little difficult for the elderly to walk down the steep road to reach the exit
The Zoo with not too many animals but a lot of them as well,"A good and comfortable visit, as it gives a packaged deal of HML and Bengal History Museum.Must go if you like a slow comfortable stroll among nature and animals"
Nice place for kids to enjoy ,"Kids can enjoy watching animals.  Need an hour time to see all animals.   Not much of walking required, best picnic spot."
Zoo,Zoological park in near natural habitat. requires more maintenance. Animals looks bored.still several animals are there including Bengal tiger.
Red panda is attraction,This zoo is worth visiting if you one wants to Red panda which is an endangered species. It also has scow leapord and Royal Bengal tiger. Very cool place to visit. It has all other animals which can be found in a typical zoo
Well worth a visit,"Excellent zoo, well laid out and easy to see special animals.Wasn't over crowded although there were many visitors there at the same time as us."
JUST ONE WORD TO SAY awesome 👍,"Go and Check it out,it's a Very good Place for you childrens & Teenager for Give tham a good Experience for Know the Animals & thay have Many New & Himalayan Animal....Must Go and Watch"
One of the best Zoo,I visited Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park with my family. We found zoo was nicely maintained. Red Panda is the star attraction here. There are two separate open enclosures for red panda. The path in the zoo is nicely marked.
Nice place to visit for kids.,"Must visit place in Darjeeling.Many animals are there like fox,wolf,tiger leopard.Approximate one hour is required to visit."
Visit if you have time,"The zoo is well maintained, we got to see the red pandas and royal Bengal tiger, there were many other animals too which are available in the Himalayan region."
A Unique Zoo!!,"This zoo was not expected to be in the local sightseeing list. But still thought of paying it a visit as it was in the city. Once we entered, we were pleasantly surprised by the way zoo was created. In the hilly terrains, they had very beautifully made use of the space intelligently in placing animals in these areas, which also makes them feels less caged when compared to zoos on flat area. All were completely controlled ans unlike other zoos there were no steel grilles completely caging the animals except monkeys which was a good thing. Other facilities are also very nicely made and very well organised.Not to forget, the entrance to himalaya mountaineering institute is also through the zoo.Overall, its a must visit, if you are in darjeeling and especially if travelling as family with kids."
High Altitude Animals,"I'm not a great fan of zoo's but this one is a little different. Aside from the red pandas there were quite a few regional, high altitude, animals for example some Blue Sheep."
A must visit,It is on everyone's local sightseeing itinerary. And you should not miss. A very clean and well maintained place. All cages have animals. You see the Bengal tiger as well. Entry rs 60. You will spend about 2 hours here. For us the main attraction was the Red Panda. Within the same premises and compound is the mounteering institute as well.
Very well maintained zoo,I must say it's a very well maintained zoo. Must visit when in darjeeling especially with kids. There isn't too much variety of animals in there but those which are there are all visible unlike other zoos where we have to keep looking to get a glimpse of the animal.
Good for kids,"The zoo is good with different animals. This is a small zoo and contains snow lepord, common lepord, black panther, red pandas, Bengal tiger (though we did get to see this), different kinds of deers and two bears. Good place for kids, they can get to see different animals. Both Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoo and Himalayan Mountaineering Institute are in same campus."
Nice place to visit,As I have seen lot of zoo this was also one of the same zoo but two uncommon species which we saw was snow leopard and red panda which you will not find in every zoo and that too at such small zoo. My kid enjoyed a lot there so overall I will certainly recommend to visit zoo if you are visiting Darjeeling
Outing with friends,After long time back we went to zoo its reminds my childhood days we saw new animals new environment its was pleasure visit for us.
A good zoo,As zoos go this is a good one. Most of the animals had a reasonable amount of space but not all. Some seemed disturbed in their enclosures but thankfully not many. You can see many big cats and lots of birds alongside a lot of fairly local and rare animals. The site is far from flat much like most of Darjeeling!
A surprisingly good collection of animals for this small community.,"My driver and guide advised me that 2 rare animals are housed in this zoo...the snow leopard and the red panda? ( see picture above). However, the overall collection of the most colourful birds I have seen were also the additional surprise and being a bird lover i thouroghly enjoyed this. I also wore traditional Nepalese clothes and had some special pictures taken to rember this trip to Darjeeling."
This will probably be the last zoo I visit,"I kind of regretted coming here as the animals (especially the large cats) are not very well accommodated.  It was especially cringeworthy when quite a few visitors whooped and shouted at the animals to get a reaction. Plenty of signs were displayed asking them no to to. There were a number of local species of deer and antelope as well as yaks on display. There is at least one tiger as well as a leopard and black panther. A couple of red pandas (an extremely cute animal) are kept as well. Overall I left feeling a bit depressed that the animals, while not badly housed, don't really really belong in these places. Maybe zoos still have their place but I don't know if I'll be patronising them in future."
Walk among the legendary mountain animals,Often read about the animals peculiar to the Himalayas. Absolutely fascinating to actually view them in real time and not on a nature programme. First ever views of a Snow Leopard and Cloud Leopard. Made the visit so worthwhile!
"Red Panda, Bengal Tiger is the Highlight","Must for all. very clean and easy to explore. this place is not so big but the collection of animals & birds is really good. right from snow leopard, to bengal tiger to Red panda. must for all. easy to locate all of the animals."
ASIM CHAKRABARTI ,"Not a instructing zoo.Cages are not maintain properly, you will not spend more than an hour. Toilets are good enough, though on the month of June 18 those were under consideration. Not sure about the present condition."
Nice place,The best place where my kid enjoyed most during the trip. The zoo is well maintained with many species which are normally not available in plain land zoo. A nice way to spend a half day during Darjeeling visit.
Beautiful and well maintained ,It's a beautiful place and well maintained.was able to see red pandas and snow leopards and black panthers and Bengal tigers. It's a good place to visit and the famous HMI is also within the zoo.
Red pandas!,"We visited the Darjeeling zoological gardens and were extremely impressed with the natural styled animal enclosures and amazing views. Having visited Kolkata zoo earlier in our trip, this zoo was much much much better. The highlight was feeding time for the red pandas, just before 4pm which resulted in lots of activity and close up photos! The black panther and snow leopards were also a highlight."
Zoological Garden,Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Garden is located in Darjeeling. Here there are many animals including tigers and bears. There is a nominal charge for entering this place. People can come to this place by walking only. Children will like this place much more.
Nice Place,We visited the zoo as well as the institute at the time when the rain just stopped. The weather was very good and all the animals kept there were out of their shades. Kids enjoyed a lot as they came across animals which they have read in the books. We maintained. Bit of steep walk which exhausted everyone. A must visit place.
One of the best maintained zoo in India,"One of the best maintained zoo in India. Good collection of limited animals like 'Red Panda', 'Snow Leopard',  'Clouded Leopard', 'Bengal Tiger', 'Himalayan Wolf', 'Taskin', etc. Animals too kept in very well captivate."
very nice place,the zoo and the HMI can be visited together they are at the same place the kids enjoyed seeking the panda and the tiger  excellent place for the kids
Must ,Must visit if one wants to see Red Panda( my only interest to visit it)Well maintained but steep walk for elderly
Must visit if you are in Darjeeling,"Neither me nor the kids are fans of the zoo as such but heard such awesome reviews of this one that we decided to visit.My! What an experience it was. The rare red panda is the show stealer but we also got to see a glimpse of barking deer, cloud leopard, snow leopard and some rare birds. It was fun with family and doesn't give the impression of animals caged or anything."
Not bad,"I don't like zoos much as I prefer to see animals in the wild. At least here, they were in open air and for some of them in large spaces. The highlight for me was the bears interacting together. I wouldn't call this place romantic at all but it was a nice daytime activity. It's also possible to take pictures in local ethnic clothes for 50 rupees. It's quick and worth it."
Nice place for the visitors as well as for the animals,"Darjeeling Zoo, or Padmaja Naidu Zoological garden is a must visit place in Darjeeling tour. The special attraction in this zoo is the red pandas. Apart from them you will find good number of birds, Royal Bengal Tiger, Leopard, Wolf, Bear and so on and so forth. It's a nice place for the young children. There was a reptile room also but during my journey it was closed as they are saying that all the reptiles are on hibernation. For the tickets you have to pay 60 bucks for each individual. There may be some different charges for the foreigners."
Must Visit................,"We were lucky to get a good look at all the animals. Seeing up close the snow leopard, Royal Bengal Tiger, black panther, asian bears and red panda is exhilarating. You should take sufficient time to visit this place and avoid timings between 1 and 2pm because most animals would take naps then. 100% MUST VISIT!!"
"Good,needs to improve.",Good but need more varieties of animals which will attract more tourists. Clean and well maintained. Extension required very much.
North east india tour,Beautiful place to visit Reserved red pandas make this place worthy as well as crazy Different types of zoological & botnical things are described there with the facts which is very helpful for knowledge
Excellent zoo,Must visit with young children. The zoo is excellently kept with good distance from visitors...staff was also helpful
Very good,It is a very well designed and maintained . The cages and the open areas/roads are kept clean . If they can introduce a electric buggy it would be helpful to senior citizens.
Nice zoo but area is huge,"Zoo is okok. We loved red panda. Area is so big that it may take huge time to cover the zoo. So, be very specific. Overall as you are going to Darjeeling, you should visit it. But try to cover it within 2 hrs."
Must visit,Must visit place.. So many distinct animals.. Leopard and the bengal tiger was the highlight of the day.
well laid out zoological park maintained very well,the entire area was very well maintained.all the enclosures were neat and the informative board with very usefulthe staff were very much eager to help the tourists as well desist anyone from teasing the animalsred panda was a huge draw as well as the royal bengal tiger
Familiarise with Himalayan animals and birds here...,We went there on a misty morning. There are many Himalayan animals here. We saw the red panda for the  first time. The zoological park is set amidst tall trees and it is a wonderful experience to walk along the narrow lane observing the birds and animals. There are many varieties of trees here. If you want to observe everything then you need to spend one full day here. But we got only 2 hours. We tried to cover as much as possible in limited time. There is also a museum with stuffed animals and birds inside the park. It is a good place to visit.
"Well marked, well maintained and a must visit","Beautiful place, takes some strenght to finish it but it is very clean, well maintinated and the markings are superb which make it easy to navigate and complete without any confusion. The Bengal Tiger is beautiful but so are the rest of the well looked after animals."
Excellent Zoo,"Lot of animals including Snow leopard, bear and red panda gave us unique experience. The zoo was very clean and well organised."
A nice point of attraction for anyone,We had been to this Zoo for a spell of about two hours and noticed that every visitor is enjoying all aspects of the Zoo. We met a French family and their children's were looked to be like mesmerized by observing Red Pandas. It appeared to be  a haven for animals  and centre of attraction for animal lovers and nature enthusiasts.
Excellent low key zoo,We loved seeing the Himalayan bear and the snow leopard but as always feel we would rather see them in the wild but the true highlight was the Royal Bengal tiger.  Always have misgivings about caged animals and birds but will probably never see the aforementioned animals in the wild.   Very bust when we visited. Cheap to get in INR 100 which also included the Himalayan Mountain Institute in the same grounds.
The Zoo,Its alwz fun to see animals.Had visited the zoo with my husband n son. There arnt much animal but the ones which are there are well fed and maintained. The red panda is the cutest.whenever u are in Darjeeling u sud visit Zoo to bring out the child in You.
One time visit,As compared to the other zoos around country this one is okey. With limited number of animals around a good walk around the zoo is good.You can see tiger and black panther a d red panda and bear and many more.Good catagory of birds can be seen.
Zoo ,"The Zoo has some rare species like Red panda and snow leapord. Also special animals like yak, bear and Bengal tiger. The Himalayan Mountaineering building and the Museum is inside the Zoo campus."
Awesome!!!,This zoo is very much structured. They have maintained is very precisely. Just follow their direction to roam around.
Wildlife zoo,Went there with friends.spend around 1.5 hours in zoo & HMI together.Snow leopard Royal bengal tiger Himalayan fox are some of the animals which we have not seen earlier. So for us it was a nice experience. Also there's a shop near HMI where you can click photos with traditional dresses on rent. Tickets are 60/ person for both zoo & HMI together.
Costly and unhygienic. Very high price of ticket ,If you are a family of more than 4 to 5 then i will say you have to spend a lot to see few animals. Though the zoo is having animals around but the animals are not given proper food and are not taken care properly. There cages are not clean and the places where they sit and spend their time is very dirty. They take 60 rupees. ITS A HUGE Amount. Per person 60 rupees just to see few animals is a big amount. Earlier it was 40 rupees but now it is 60/-. Its too much.
Wildlife zoo,Entry into the wildlife park is twinned with a ticket for HMI. I have to say I am not a big fan of zoos or wildlife parks generally so I probably wouldn't have visited this by itself. The enclosures are ok but they are wildlife and you wish they were bigger.
Not at all looked after.,"We felt that the zoo is not at all properly looked after by the concerned authorities.Most of the animals seem to starve, with lean and feeble body. Cages are neither clean and nor hygenic. I really felt bad about the animals there. Entry fee is  Rs. 60 per head but maintanance is poor."
One of the best well kept zoos I have visited,"Located about 5 kms form central Darjeeling this is a must visit place of Darjeeling. Great layout, well kept, informative. Great environment for animals. Rare animals such as snow leopard, Red Panda and of course the Royal Bengal Tiger !!"
Clean and silent.,A very good number and varieties of animals. They are not cramped and have spacious living. One important word of appreciation to authorities is they've have nicely marked the route map by painting the direction on the road. You will neither miss nor get confused. There will be orderly movement of tourists.
Go for suree..,"Well maintained zoo, closes by 4pm.Red Panda, Benmgal tiger, snow leopard in full glory are the star attractions.A must visit with kids.."
A clean and Nicely Maintained Zoo,Properly pointed directions and cleanliness is very much noticeable.The landscape adds to the beauty of it.Loved watching the Black Panther and the Red Panda.
Great Place for Natural Life and Mountain Life,"Its a place not only for seeing rare species of Animals, but also the sacrifice and dedication our Indian Army has in guarding us at the -30 degrees in Himalayas and other regions, don't miss out the Video show which will give you the Spirit of Indian. Apart from this we have Museum with details about the Tribal Culture, weapons, dressess, animals etc."
TO SEE RED PANDA,"Well maintained zoo . Neat and cleaned .Good place for kids to watch red panda, tiger, Black panther, Bear and many animals."
Small one but good one,Its a small zoo but well maintained. Good directions provided for the path to be followed.Red Panda and Snow leopard were the best part about this zoo.
Animal point,"Small hill top zoo with limited animal habitation, closed on Thursday so plan accordingly, a tourist spot ."
An idyllic journey ,"More than the zoo, the walk to it is a very nice and idyllic one..the zoo is very well spread out and offers a good sunny experience"
Small zoo,"Visited as part of a tour of attractions in and around Darjeeling.Small zoo with quite a few empty enclosures. Most of the animals were kept in small cages.Steep climb; can be difficult for elderly and physically challenged.Had a few big cats -- jaguar, royal bengal tiger, etc -- and a very small aviary. The main attraction was the red panda.The zoo appeared to be clean and well maintained.Overall: Small zoo with limited number of animals. You won't miss much if you skip it but, perhaps, worth a visit if you have small children."
Very well maintained zoo,A well maintained zoo and good collection of animal. Specially Red Panda Black Panthar. Special to mention that all the animals are healthy not like other zoo in india.
A well-maintained zoo,"The enclosures are big, animals seem well looked after and the place has flora fauna that is native to the area. Which is fascinating. So don't forget to look all around you - the trees flower, insects, birds, etc.This is a much much much better zoo than the one in Bombay. Partly thanks to the climate and how the authorities have looked after it.Good strict policy against carrying plastic inside, mainly to prevent visitors from trashing the place."
The Beauty of Wildness,"The zoo was a great place to visit! Such amazingly is the place maintained with such a variety of animals, it is really worthwhile to spend time in here. The animals are distinctively organized and placed according to their types, e.g. herbivore, birds, reptiles etc. The place is clean, and is full of greens that is sure to soothe the eye. There is also a museum which is another attraction inside the zoo. Walking can cause a bit tiredness since the area is vast, but it's alright when one is visiting such a beautiful place!"
Worth watching,"This place has three points all inside the same.When you enter the park you will see animals and later you have Himalyan mountaineering institute , and Bengal natural history museum. All are worth watching. Walking there is a bit tiring but rest all is good."
Very well maintained,"The way this place is made is amazing, you get to see all the animals very clearly. They also have some really beautiful birds and they have almost all big cat family animals."
Hidden gem - unexpectedly awesome,"I've been to many zoos - both in india and outside. This zoo is very well kept, clean, and in short area there are so many herbivorous and carnivorous. Amazing! Must go."
Well maintained zoo in high hills of himalayas,"Its a neat and clean zoo where all wild animals looks to be healthy. Bengal tiger ,Himalayan white tiger are added attraction to this zoo apart from other varieties of wild animals"
Mrs,Nothing special seen lot of better zoos then this one. Poor Bengal Tiger look in disgusted stat. Felt sorry for him. Only nice thing was the way it was built on a slopes.
Must visit,Nice zoo to see the regional wildlife. Very affordable to get in and have access to several attractions at the same time. It will take you 2-3 hours to get around the park. A must-do when you’re in Darjeeling.
A must visit for kids.,"A very well maintained Zoo with different varieties of animals , birds and reptiles . A must visit if you are travelling with kids ."
Beauty of nature,"The only zoo in darjeeling with birds,animals,museum... Must visit place in darjeeling..main attraction is red panda.."
Zoo darjeeling ,"Great joy to see the zoo despite little time. Snow leopard, beer, tiger etc. Are main attraction. Mountaineering institute is worth to see"
Highlight of the trip,"More than the rarity of the animals at display, was touched by the way they have been kept - neat and spacious enclosures with an overall peaceful atmosphere. A must do on every traveller's list though the tip would be to do it immediately as the place opens in the morning - to avoid the typical tourist crowds later in the day."
Nice small Zoo,It is a nice zoo which is maintained well with some uncommon animals like red panda. The zoo has been developed very nicely and you feel nice walking around with greenery all around. A good place to spend an hour or two.
The animals in the Zoo were all looking well fed and well looked after,"It was very pleasant to slowly amble around the Park to look at all the animals. They were all well fed and kept in large enclosures with ample space and good shelter. The tigers were especially magnificent, and there is also a rare snow leopard, with spots on silvery-white fur, which I have never seen before. It was very interesting to see the Red Panda here, it is much smaller than the black and white Pandas, and is very cute!"
Good one,Nice place to hangout for a day.... We can see many endengered species there..... Nice place.....just outside the city.....
Its okay! Something is better than nothing ,"It's an okay zoo. It's nice because it has some unusual animals that you would not see in other places. Snow leopard, red panda, Himalayan goats, yak, Himalayan sheep, black leopard etc. The road is steep and hence it's a bit troublesome for people with less physical endurence. Tickets are too costly for this zoo- 60 rupees! Not worth it. But then again it covers the mountaineering institute too. If you have kids, definitely visit this place."
"A small zoo, with uncommon animals","Great place to observe some uncommon & rare animals like the red panda, snow leopard, clouded leopard, black panther, etc. But more animals/birds should be added to the zoo."
A zoo in the mountain and a Mountaineering Institute,"Kids would love this place. My 6 year old jumped with joy seeing the mighty snow leaopard, black panther, the huge tiger and of course the lazy and sleepy red panda. What makes this zoo different from the other zoo is the area and its layout. Keeping in view of its occupants' natural habitat, the various varieties of deers, mountain goats, wolves, fox, this mountain zoo has ensured that they have ample space to move around, rather climb up an down. Another attraction is the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute which has an interesting collection of mountain gears, information about the Himalayan flaura and fauna, about the tribal and collections brought in by various mountaineers as a memoir of their expedition.Alltogether it would be a wonderful experience to spend some time there and ofcourse there is no count of the amount of calories you would burn, which is always a welcome."
A different part of darjeeling unlike the other,"You can see a lot of varieties of Himalayan wildlife  in there, The Red panda is one of their best attraction."
Well maintained and good collection ,"We got to see quite a few animals endemic to the region like the Red Panda. We also managed to see the Snow Leopard and of course the majestic royal Bengal tiger, Samrat. This place should figure on your go-to list."
Beautiful,"A very small sized zoo that's been made to cater for the Himalayan specific fauna of the region. So run into Antelopes, tigers, leopards and most famous Red Panda, which are by the way, too cute. The entry fee is very nominal and they have restrooms and tea stalls inside. Do visit the HMI and the museums inside during the tour. Best place to bring kids."
A glimpse of some mountain predators,"A beautifully laid out zoological park with a decent variety of wildlife - predators, birds and snakes. At one end of the Park is the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) which houses an awe-inspiring museum. A must visit!"
Rare & exotic Himalayan fauna,"The zoo gas some of the rare n exotic Himalayan fauna consisting of a bengal tiger, snow leopard, bear, wolf a d best of all, the red pandas.. Also some very exotic birds.."
A beautiful zoo,The zoo had a very friendly bengal tiger and red panda s as their usp. Snow leopard and other felines area must watch
"Wonderful Zoo,one must visit at Darjeeling","By the word Zoo,many people may think what to see there beyond any city zoo,but the idea is totally wrong. Here at Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park,lots of Himalayan animals and birds are kept for visitors.One can also see Royal Bengal tiger here,but animals and birds of Himalayan range are surely added attraction here.One must have enough time to see everything,it takes three to four hours to properly cover all parts. One can see Himalayan bear,Himalayan Wolf,Red Pandas, varities of peacock class birds and panther to name a few.One has to walk a bit,but proper resting places are also available.Remember please,it closes at 4-30 AM"
Visit to Zoo,A good assortment of animals. Fortunate to see Bengal Tiger. Long and steep walk. Animal numbers are limited.
WELL DONE!,"I normally do not like visiting zoos as I do not like to see animals in such tiny enclosed spaces, but I must say that this is not the case with Darjeeling Zoo. It has been well maintained and all the animals look healthy and well taken care of. As we were staying at Little Tibet Resort, we were only a leisurely 15 minutes walk away from the zoo. The first day, we arrived in the afternoon and we were a bit rushed as zoo was closing soon. It was also a bit crowded and there were a few tourists misbehaving with the animals. This is one area I feel that the zoo could improve on. They should have more guards around the area watching over these tourists and take strict action against them. Next day, we walked back again at the opening time itself. There were very few people at the time and it was a lovely experience. The Bengal Tiger, snow leeopard and red panda were all out and enjoying themselves in the relative quietness of the moving in the absence of rowdy tourists. After spending almost 3 hours at the zoo, we walked to Shruberry Nightingale park on our way back to Little Tibet for lunch. Must visit place for all people, but would recommend it more in the morning before it gets crowded."
Hmalayan beauty,"One can see the Himalayan beasts here specially Red Panda, Snow Leopard & white Wolf. Within the zoo the Bengal Natural History Museum is awesome."
Biggest problem is parking,Huge problem of parking for tourist in Darjeeling zoo. More then 300 meters to walk just to reach zoo entrance.
Best zoo in the country ,"Arguably the best maintained zoo in the country. There are quite a few rare animals of high altitudes. The red panda and black panther are unique. The zoo is clean and although not the biggest, packs quite a few uncommon animals. A must see during the Darjeeling trip.Be prepared to walk up and down the slopes though. BUT it is worth it!!!"
Not great,"This zoo is full of sad animals kept in solitary confinement.  It's ok for an Indian zoo and, no doubt, the animals are well cared for generally - but you might find it depressing.  Not much to do in Darjeeling so you'll probably end up here anyway. Be prepared..."
Reasonable collection of animals,"The big cats were the highlight of this park. The royal Bengal tiger, snow leopard, common leopard were the star attractions."
ZOO- Should Visit if Travelling with Kids,"It's a ZOO- that's it is. If traveling with young kids of age 10 years or so, it's a place to visit in Darjeeling. Kids will definitely have good time. Himalayan Red Panda is main attraction there ...Take some snacks with you which your kids like to eat. Time required is about an hour depending upon what you like to see....Overall nice place for kids. For young couple or elderly persons, zoo can be avoided......"
Himalayan wildlife and mountaineering museum at one place,Good place to visit with kids. Mountaineering enthusiast would love the HMI museum inside the zoo. The place also offers great view of Darjeeling town.
Best ever views of red pandas,"The zoo is set on the side of a steep hill. You need good lungs to reach the top! The views of the red pandas were terrific. We loved seeing yaks, but felt sorry for the big cats, especially the snow leopard. It looked very old and tired. We got good views of the Himalayan wolves, we had never seen them before. Worth about an hour of your time to get a glimpse of Himalayan wildlife."
Nice zoo ,Well maintained zoo within Darjeeling..of all the sight seeing places liked this place..few animals like leopard tiger pheasant red panda can be found along with bird aviary..good for kids..clean place ..
Don't go on Thursdays ,"This zoo is closed on Thursdays.  The red panda, snow leopard,  Tibetan  wolf, the black bear...and wild fowl are the main attractions."
Best attraction for kids,Visit here with your kids and they'll definitely have a good time. The main attraction here is the red panda.
One of the best zoo,Amazing zoo with a museum.Great view of animals.Treat to see bengal tiger and red panda.Very neat and clean.
Awesome Zoo with rarities such as the Snow Leopard & the Red Panda!!!,"Beautiful and well maintained zoo that houses otherwise rarely seen animals such as the Snow Leopard and the Red Panda! Pretty well maintained too. Definitely worth a visit, specially if you are with kids!Don't miss the Natural History Museum and yes, be prepared to walk a little!"
Good Zoo,"Must visit the zoo when visit Darjeeling sight scene.There are many types of birds, animals, snakes etc. & 2 museums."
very nice zoo,Very good zoo with all the animals in their natural environment. this zoo is big and lots of animal and also u can see red panda there and also there is  museum of Himalyan Mountaineering Institute.
Worth a visit,If you want to see animals from the region this is the place to go.  For us the Snow Leopard and Begal Tiger were the main attraction
Darjeeling visit,Very good zoo with all the animals in their natural environment. The Royal Bengal Tiger was the must watch. Must visit place for children.
Very good Zoo,"Very good place for kids and even adults to understand  differet type of animals,birds and reptiles found in Himalyan range of forests. Must place to see when you are in Darjeeling. Also, DO NOT miss visiting the museum of  Himalyan Mountaineering Institute (HMI)"
Nice park with animals,Enjoyed the nature's park!! The red panda is a must see. They even have the snow leapord which is a very rare species.
Amazing Zoo,"Its quite an amazing zoo where one can find Bears, Foxes, Black Panther, Leopord, Royal Bengal Tiger, Yak & other animals."
Good collection of animals,Very nice to see the animals local to the place. Must visit in Darjeeling. Highly recommended but pls visit in the first half of the day.
Good collection of rare birds,"We could see lots of rare birds. But since are kept inside glass cover, it's very difficult to take photos. It also hosts several red panda including few young ones. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
Beautiful Park with a huge Zoo,Beautiful Place U can easily see different types of animals as well as birds...  The best part is they maintain it very well so that U can easily see all the different Species of Animal and Birds...
Worth a visit...,"If u r a nature lover then one of the best place to visit in Darjeeling..it has some uniques animals and a rich Natural history museum. Himalayan mountaineering institute ,zoo,and Bengal natural history museum is in the same campus. U can also take pictures in traditional dress also."
Wonderful zoo and Museum,"There are rare species of mountain animals like Snow Leopard, Red Panda and different species of mountain antelopes etc. The museum inside the zoo premises was wonderful and make this place in must visit list. Visited here in April 2017."
Animals looked starved and weak,The zoo is a nice place to be with family and children..we loved the place.. animals looked starved  and weak..
Animals in their original habitat,"Pleasantly surprised by the zoo. I have been to major zoos around the world and was preparing for the worst. The barking deer, Yak, and other mountain animals were on steep hillsides. They had lots of natural greenery. The only animals I was concerned with were the cats, but when are caged cats ever in a good environment. Lots of greenery once again. My only complaint was the visitors. They were calling to the animals and whistling at the cats. Even though there were signs to be quiet and don't tease the animals. They need employees to be there educating the visitors on proper zoo behavior. They had a museum section, with taxidermy. Bad job there, the animals did look dead. Poorly done, some birds looking like they were just shot and laying there."
Must go if you have kids,This houses some of the diminishing creatures and is to be visited if you have kids. Not so great if you have are a couple on a tour
Padmaja Naidu Darjeeling Zoo and Himalyan Mountainering Institute,"This is a High altitude zoo with variety of wild cats like tiger, black panter, cheetah, snow cheetah,etc varieties of Deer, a special Red Panda and other varities of zoo animals. Must watch for Darjeeling visit"
Splendid,"I went to Padmaja Naidu Zoological Park. Padmaja Naidu Zoological Park plays host to the only collection of Siberian Tigers in India and few other exotic animal species, such as Red pandas, Snow leopards, Himalayan black bears etc. It is great place to go."
Well Maintained Zoo,Well kept zoo. Nice big enclosures. Some interesting animals like the Red Panda and different kinds of leopards. There was a very big tiger also. The zoo borders on the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute which had a really nice museum. Very well presented with interesting exhibits of old Himalayan expeditions.
my kids enjoyed it..,"It is a good zoo with tigers, lions and red panda as its main attraction. Kids loved it.. also, there r food stalls outside that serve good fast food and tea.."
A well maintained Zoo ,"We generally visit the zoo atleast twice during a stay at Darjeeling . The zoo is well maintained. Animals are well fed and sign of caring attitude of the administration is evident everywhere. Very neatly maintained.This time we did not find the second royal bengal tiger and heard about his/ her demise because of old age . However this information requires verification. This time we missed the woolves also. Black Panther, Snow Leopard , Chitah , Yaks, Bears, Deers , Blue Sheeps etc and of course Red Pandas  all are there and seemed to be in good shape.The bird cage has been shifted to the Red panda area. There is a small restaurant within the zoo and one can find it just on the Road taking the turn to Leopard cages.Food is good , mainly chineese, and price is reasonable. Two separate Toilets are also maintained near the Bear enclosure.Visitors must note that Thursday is closed . And in all other days it is open from 8-30AM to 4-30 PM. Entry fee for SAARC citizen is  Rs 60/- per head and for others it is Rs100/-. For camera extra charge is required to be paid. Would come again ."
Worth a visit,Worth spending a morning. Some of the animals are rare in nature. Be there a bit early before they are fed otherwise most would be found sleeping.
A very best place to go for a wild life sightings .,"Huge enough to spend few hours with absolute silence and pure environment with more pure Oxygen.The park itself in steep paths,so take enough time to stroll otherwise if you rush you will go tired for sure.I will surely bet you cant see such a clean and higenic rest rooms even in airports."
Amazing zoo..variety of wildlife and well maintained,"Padmaja Naidu zoological park is one of the best zoo I have visited in India and is very well maintained. There is a variety of wildlife on view including Tiger, Bear, Snow Leopard, Red Panda, number of Birds, Panther, Deers and reptiles. There is an excellent museum with stuffed animals and birds; kids will absolutely love the close views in the museum. There is a lot of area to walk and in cool weather, one will enjoy the place. There is an entrance fee and parking might be a problem as the roads are narrow here. Highly recommended during visit to Darjeeling"
Best zoo in India,"One of the most lively zoological park in India due to such a nice climate in Darjeeling. A 15 minutes walking distance(steep) from Mal, this zoo is a must visit place in Darjeeling. Royal Bengal Tiger,black beer, Snow leopard , Red panda,Black panther,barking deer and lots of birds n reptiles are there. It will take around one hour to complete the visit. The zoo is well maintained and clean."
Nice Place to Visit,"Better than Kolkata Zoo. Moreover, if the weather is fine you'll enjoy walking through the place. Recommended."
"Nicely maintained, a must visit ",USP of the place r the museums . Especially the mountaineering one. One of its kind. Overall place is very clean and nicely kept. 
Freedom for animals,"Not all animal sitting in the cages, for those which are - good space to walk around. well maintained, green area with the nature museum. Was a bit shocked to see the animal mummies and heads in, but the keeper explained that the collection was from the time of British colonial…"
family Tour,The red panda and the Bengal tiger were the attraction of this zoo...Evey children should visit this zoo.
Rare animals like snow leopard and red panda in captivity,"One of the richest Zoo of the country. Some of the animals like Red Panda, Cloud Leopard and Snow Leopard can be witnessed here only. Also having collection of some very good Pheasants. You can also enjoy Black Tiger the famous Bagheera character of Jungle Book. "
Sanju,"Very well maintained,  a unique type of zoo, a great visit, makes it very interesting with uphill and downhill walks,  very near himalayan mountaineering, must visit place in Darjeeling"
A Cold Zoo,"Journey in this zoo, i was gain different experiences. A lot of animal and others their. But one of great things is about museum, there have a lot of important matter about mountain"
Good experience ,"It’s a well maintained and well organised place. We had an awesome experience. You have cafeteria, public conviniences, animals, birds and most importantly the red panda.We were fortunate to see almost all the animals even after the heavy fog.I would surely recommend a visit to this place if you are in Darjeeling."
Worth visiting ,"The zoo is well maintained and has a  bear, snow leopard, leopard, a royal bengal tiger and various other birds and animals. The red panda is a special attraction. HMI and the zoo are colocated."
SMALL ZOO,if are from a big city you will feel certainly cheated here . very small place with not so many animals . but i visited this place in 1990 - may be a lot of changes now
Places to visit,"What a fantastic outing spent at this extraordinary zoo.  We would never have been able to view a tiger, panther or panda if we hadn't visited.  A stunning day spent outdoors with blue sky and warm sunshine enhanced the experience.  I can highly recommend"
Must visit Zoo in Darjeeling,"Fantastic zoo, with animals like Tiger, Snow Leopard, Bear, Deer, Yak, Red Panda, Exotic Birds & Reptiles all available. People who like watching these animals must go. And it is a must if you have kids with you they would love it.40% animals are kept in protected open area, so it really feels like watching them in real without any cage.Tigers and other wild animals are kept in cage for obvious reasons :)Also the location is fantastic the clouds come at any time makes the place feel like heaven. You will need at-least 2-3 hours to see the entire place at peace."
Badly maintained,This zoo needs make lager enclosures for the animals . ......... Signs of distress on every animal that's exibited.
Interesting,Really nice Zoo and well maintained. Spotting Red Panda was really nice. Nice place to hang out with Kids.
"Good place if you're a ""Biology Guy""",Basically I'm not a Zoo guy. I mean I don't like to watch caged animals. Nevertheless this place has got couple of endemic mammals and iconic Himalayan Red Panda. It's not that big rather calling it small will be appropriate. But still it has great variety of long trees which remain surrounded by clouds all the time.You have to pay extra 10 rupees for your camera.
Wow!!!,It's nice to visit the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park. They have a wide range of animals in this zoological park. I would love to visit again.
Zoo park,"Nice place to visit to witness many exotic Himalayan animals, the zoo enclosure s are way too small and one can find stressful behaviour of animals, would be much better if it's a bigger place, nethertheless it's worth a visit"
Zoological Park,It is good zoo at an altitude above 7000 feet.Yes children would definitely enjoy going round this zoo.  a must visit place as Darjeeling has a few places for visit. Some of the animals are kept in small enclosures but most are kept in sufficient open enclosures.
must visit,"very nice, very informative. must take a GUIDE with u. we took one female guide with us and she had great knowledge."
Nice experience,"This is nothing like our city zoos. This is spread over a wide area and a lot of animals like Red Panda, Black Panther, etc can be seen. This is just beside HMI in the same compound. So this place is also a must visit."
Nice zoo,"If you have kids with you, this is a must-do place in Darjeeling. Some of the animals are kept in small enclosures but most are kept in wide open ones where you can see then doing routine things. You have to walk quite a lot (1-2 hours) but not too up/down and the cold weather of Darjeeling helps. The star attractions are the Red Panda and Snow Leopard. The whole place looks well-maintained and clean."
Must visit place,Very nice place with lot of animals around very neat and clean and a very good Museum located inside the zoo batter  taking guide that will make things easy for you children will love this place
Well maintained,"The animals look healthy and well taken care of. The enclosures are large. To top it all there are pkenty of rare animals like clouded leopard, Bison, red panda etc. My toddler daughter really enjoyed the visit. The uphill walk though can be challenging."
One of the best things to do in Darjeeling,"I dont know why this doesnt figure among the top 3 things to do in Darjeeling, the hours spent here are really worth it ! You get to see some very rare animals like Red Panda, Snow leaopard and others, which are difficult to find elsewhere in India. It takes around 2-3 hours to cover all of the zoo, which is very well maintained, has detailed information boards about the flora and fauna, and has proper facilities like washrooms, food stalls etc. Do make sure you include this place in your itinerary.Cheers !"
Must visit place,"Dont miss vsiitng the ZOO, especially wait the watch the most adorable and shy animal ""Red panda"". you need 1000 eyes to see the animal. Wonderful place yet made me sad looking at tiger and leopards in a small captivity."
darjeeling zoo,we are group tour with heena tour & travel   visited the zoo   is very well maintained good collection of snow leopard himalayn wolf red panda bengal tiger panther               himalayan mountaneeing institute is also located here     the mueseum inside the zoo is a best place to see
Animal found in snow,The zoological park visited by me was amazing. The animals found in cold place was there. This was first instance I saw these animals.
Small but Great,"As you walk in the entrance you are presented with the bear enclosure where unlike a lot of zoos, you can actually see the bears up close.   Not a great number of animals live at the zoo but those that are there look very healthy.   Also included in the price is entry to the Himalayan Institue of Mountaineering which outlines different mountaineers feats as well as has a climbing wall for young adventurers to try their hand at the experience."
Good for kids,"Visited this zoo during June during our stay in Darjeeling. Need to walk steep road, however the collection of animals are good. may not be recommended for aged people as it will be a tiresome one."
A must go place in darjeeling,It's a well organised zoo.I must say if u r in darjeeling then u  should pay a visit to this place.Kids love to watch animals .Himalayan mountaineering institute is also located here.Its also has a very good history of mountaineering expeditions. Overall a lovely place to spend time.It takes 2-3 hours for peacfully exploring this place.
My daughter loved it,Quite a number of animals..bear..snow leopard..Bengal tiger..we skipped the mountaineering institute since myy toddler was so happy looking at the animals..we dint want to interrupt it. Different from regular zoos that I have visited.
Should go once,"If you are in darjeeling and want to go around, this is one of the places you may go. Apart from the animals, the zoo is not like a conventional zoo as seen in India. Its a nice experience to spebd some time in this place between long trees and overlooking hills. Its very green inside and the zoo us cut out on the hills. The syberian slow leopard, black panther and the huge royal bengal tiger are the main attraction apart from the colorful birds. Its a big place and will take more than an hour. The himalayan mountaineering institue is also there back of the zoo. Kids will enjoy the place and so the grown ups. Not a place one should miss."
Great,"We could see Royal Bengal Tiger and must say that it ad a royal appeal. We could see many different animals in the zoo, its a well maintained place and must see place during visit to Darjeeling."
Park visit.,It's a great Zoological Park with lots of trees and greenery all around this park. Entry fees are reasonable.
Awesome Place,"One of the best place to visit at Darjeeling.All the Himalayan animals are available.Beside the zoo,there is a well maintained Historical Museum.The Himalayan animals are so cute."
A zoo on Hill,In this zoo you can see many species of animal & Birds. You can also see rare Red Panda there. Good facility inside the zoo for food & refreshment.  You can also see Himalayan Mountaineering Institute there
Different variety of animals,This zoo truely represents a mountain based animal habitat. We have seen different kind of animals found only in mountains. There are approx 25-30 animals in this zoo. Also it is jointly located with Himalayan mountaineering institute.
Birthday celebration ,"The zoo logical park is the house for Himalayan flora and fauna. Very well maintained and organized. Red panda and black panther are the special attraction. The park also has a museum that has various collection of butterflies, birds and reptiles.. The place will amaze you with varieties of insects as well. A perfect place for nature lovers."
Best high altitude zoo in India,One best well kept zoo....I relived my childhood memories as i could meet the charectors of mowgli right from baloo to ponya ☺️☺️.
Excellent,"Such a lovely zoo in the mountains!Excellent to view/watch animals! This zoo has paths that are above or below animal areas. So, you can really watch the whole area of an animal like on a plate - this is tremendous!!! A compulsory place to go - you definitely will enjoy it. Exotic animals. clean, quiet, beautiful views."
Awesome zoo,This is one of the best places to visit if you have small kids with you. Our family enjoyed a lot and so did kids. You can find almost all kind of animals here.
Good,It is a good place to get away from city and watch exotic animals and have afun time with your family
Nice zoo in mountains,"Visited this place with two Young kids and along with them, we loved watching all animals. The key attractions were red panda and black panther. Wolfs were in good numbers as well. Recommend this place to visit specially travelling with kids and if u r a nature lover urself."
Worth a visit while in Darjeeling,This zoo is very well set up that you need not walk long distances to see one animal after another. Nicely maintained too.
"Natural Enclosures, Selective Wildlife, Extensive Uphill Walks","This Zoo has an exclusive & limited selection of wildlife - Red Panda, Black Himalayan Bear, Snow Leopard, Royal Bengal Tiger etc. The Zoo is located near a hilltop at a 1/2 hour uphill drive from the city centre. A long uphill walk on paved road has a series of wildlife…"
Do visit for red panda,"Red panda can be seen only in this place ..its on the right side after entering. Its such a cute and rare animal to see. Other animals are also exhibited well , but its on a hill slope so some may find it difficult to walk through whole of it."
Small is Beautiful,"This Zoo is worth visiting, Normally you have to go miles to see the Animals but this zoo is very small and you don't have to walk much but can have lot of Animal to see from the very close. A must visit spot for Children..But take a Guide with you..They will charge 300 for 3 points Zoo, HMH, Bengal museum, but will explain you in details and with that you will get the essence of that place..300 for Guide would be worth spending."
"Must visit, small yet loaded with surprises","It's must visit place if you enjoy wildlife. It's sad to see life in cage but this zoo has some species which for normal person are very difficult to see in wild. Small place overload of surprises, clean. Where else in world can you see Snow leapord & Clouded Leapord next to each other."
One of the best zoo in North east India,"We visited the zoo in Last week of May. This one is much better than one in Gangtok with well laid out path.Must see different species of leopard, Himalayan bear and red pandas.Must watch in Darjeeling especially if you are travelling with the kids."
worth visiting,"good, specially red panda,well maintained.children will like a lot.a bit steep  but this place is worth visiting."
Zootopia,"Darjeeling zoo is well maintained. Animals look well fed. Variety of animals and birds is awesome. One of the major draws is the red panda. But dont miss the black panther, snow leopard, bear and the Royal Bengal Tiger. The tiger made us wait for some time and then decided to favour us with a royal walk. The one thing you feel with this creature is thankful for the fence in between. The museum inside the zoo is a must see. You will be astounded at the things on display. Dont rush, take your time, relax."
Red Panda!,Well maintained zoo...much cleaner than Alipore Zoo. Has a good collection of predatory big cats! Loved the close encounter with the Royal Bengal Tiger...
Northeast tour,A very good zoo. Eventhough it's small they have a good collection of leopard and red 🐼 and royal Bengal tiger were superb. Very neatly maintained.
One of the best attractions of darjeeling,"This is a must visit place for families with children. The park closes by 5.30 - do plan to reach by a maximum 3 pm to make the best of the place. Patience really pays well, as there is only 1 Red Panda. There are few animals which one can see only here. The museum's and Himalayan institte can be given a skip - depends on ones personal interest. The zoo does have a canteen with options for light snack. Ensure you ask the driver to leave you at the ticket entrance (vehicles are permitted), else you would have to walk quiet a bit. From the City sharing taxi is also available at Rs 10 per person, who would not drop you till the top."
Good,Breast view and natural. All facilities available in zoo. Animals are less bit good. Clouds are every where in zoo. I suggest all to go and visit the zoo
Average,"Get to see the snow leopard, the black panther and the red panda which are the main attractions.Zoo can be covered in 30 mins."
Nice Visit,Known for its Clouded Leopard and Royal Bengal Tiger and antelopes. You need to do a lot of walking and its pretty steep!!
Zoo,"This is famous for red panda, area wise its not very huge so can see all the animals with in one and a half hour. We enjoyed a lot."
Nature's paradise,"The most amazing thing about this zoo is red panda and snowlion.In a relatively small area, you can find nearly all animals. Fortunate enough to see royal bengal tiger roaming around inside the cage and red panda."
Less animals,Zoo is having less animals. Parrots are good to see. Samll Pandas never come out of their rest place. Royal Bengal tiget is attractive. Few panthers are there. But in overall it has very less animals. May need an hr or 1.5 hrs to visit the zoo.
One of the best kept zoos.,"(Seo 2014) Well, we can all criticize zoos as animals are kept inside cages there. But this was special especially many ""enclosures"". The variety of animals is huge. Saw many animals for the first time there. Red panda and clouded leopard to name a few."
