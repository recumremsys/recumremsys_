Really good place. Just that we visit before the countries went to Lockdowns,It was nice when there is nobody around not too crowded as half of the world is on a lockdown. But as based on older photos it was very crowded.
A magnificent highlight,"You just have to visit Fushimi Inari while staying in Kyoto! It is so amazing and I have never experienced anything like this. Get ready for a different mountain hike! Fushimi Inari Shrine - the ultimate Torii gate experience! Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousand shrines around Japan dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes were seen as Inari's messengers and there are statues of them everywhere! Behind the Shrine you will find the tens of thousands of famous Torii gates. All donated by private individuals and companies whose names and dates are written on the Torii gate they have donated. The Torii gate trails lead up to the sacred mountain Mount Inari and the trip up and down takes approx 2-3 hours. Make sure to have good footwear. I can highly reccomend to walk all the way to the top. What an unforgettable experience!"
A must visit place in Kyoto,The well known place in Kyoto. Just relax and spend your time here. I recommend you guys to come early because it will not too crowded.
Thousands of Torii Gates,"We came here on the afternoon of our first day in Kyoto and found this to be the most fascinating shrine that we visited during our two weeks in Japan. Dedicated to the Shinto God of Rice, Inari, the shrine features thousands of densely packed torii gates that provide a covered path up the mountainside. As we had limited time and it takes from 2-to-3 hours for a round-trip to the summit, we decided to hike for about 45 minutes and then return.A stream of tourists joined us for the climb, many hindering our pace by posing for photos, which required us to stop and wait. Some of the gates, which are vermilion with black at the bottom, proved to be in bad condition with chunks of wood missing. In a few places, a pole had been removed for restoration. Small restaurants and souvenir stands appeared occasionally outside the pathway, along with viewpoints. Signs unexpectedly warned about the danger of monkeys and boars, but we never saw any animals except a domestic cat sitting on a tree stump. Back at ground level, a wave of tourists poured toward us to begin the ascent. Many of them seemed to be with tour groups. None stopped to look at the shrine's main hall and Romon Gate here. They also ignored the statues of foxes, which  reflect the belief that the animal is an Inari messenger. The shrine is always open and no admission is charged. I think early morning would be a far better time to come than the afternoon when the area has a huge tourist volume. We got here via the Keihan Main Line, which has a Fushimi-Inari station., and then walked for about four minutes to reach the shrine."
Amazing - Go,"Just had to time it right to avoid a viewfinder full of Tourists, but a modicum of patience conquered all"
30 minutes climb to Mt. Inari,"It is located just in front of Inari train station. No entrance feeIt a solemn place, where devotee pay respect and homeage.Once reach on top, you will be able to view the view of Kyoto.It is advisable to visit early in the morning, to enjoy the scenery and early excercise to the top of the mountain. Crowds will start to come by 830am."
Incredible place,"This is must-do experience in Kyoto. We managed to walk to the top. Needless to say that it was just incredible; I must admit that getting to the top has been a bit of a struggle. It takes a while to get up there. Furthermore, on our way back, it rained a lot, and I mean, I lot!! I would do it again 1000 times though."
"Most important Shrine in Kyoto, ""Fushimi Inari"" by Empress Genmei","""伏見稲荷大社” or ""Fushimi Inari Taisha"" is the most important Shrine in Kyoto. This Shrine is dedicated to the Shinto God of Rice ""Inari"", constructed by Imperial Order of the Empress Genmei, who reigned during the Wado Era [708-715].Empress Genmei Ordered to enshrine 3 deities in 3 mountains on the 1st day of the Horse of the second month of 711, so it's believed that The God ""Inari"" was enshrined in that day.It's really famous for its thousands of vermilion Torii 「千本鳥居」lining the road up to the main Shrine.It's a must when visiting Kyoto! You can access from the JR Fushimi station or Keihan Fushimi Inari Station. Visit our YouTube channel [Let's Go Lab JP] so you don't miss any of our adventures! We will be giving you tips for your trip to Japan! What are you waiting for? Join Us!"
Make sure to bring home a miniature torii for your refrigerator,"From Kyoto Station catch the Nara Line (brown) and exit Inari Station, 2 stops.  It is truly amazing to walk inside the torii path.  Lots of pictures to be taken, no doubt.  Snap a picture on the golden bridge, or next to the two foxes at the gateway.  A must see shrine for all first time visitors.  Our visit was before the pandemic so masks and hand sanitizers were not required."
This shrine is not an amusement park!!,"Very interesting place, and great atmosphere.BUT... this is a place of worship, so don't act like so many jerk tourists!I saw Russian eating sandwiches in front of the ""no food allowed"" sign, Chinese tourists burping and yelling like no one else is here, and all kind of instagram fashionista blocking the tori gates tunnel so they could get that special instagram picture... Show some respect to the place and to other visitors please. This shrine is not an amusement park!!I'm so glad I got to visit a few years ago too, before the tourist rush!"
Fushimi Inari - Incredible ,I missed visiting this shrine on my last visit to Kyoto in 2018 and I was not going to miss it again. It was definitely worth the wait and I am glad that we spent the best part of a day here as there is so much to see. You cannot imagine the impact of a the Tori (gates) until you see them lined up. It really is phenomenal.
Definitely visit!,We loved our visit here - so intriguing to see so many gates!  We also found it reasonably pleasant walking in the shade on such a hot summer day.The gates are amazing and super impressive!
So happy to have visited,"This was one of the highlights of my trip to Kyoto. Easy access from the train. A bit of a hike but I was about to do it all in just over an hour with a couple of breaks. The journey is more scenic than the destination in this case.  Lots of shrines along the way and nice views of Kyoto. No view of the city at the top, it's a big shrine at the top and then you descend."
Amazing site!,Definitely a place you don't want to miss. It is awesome to walk through all the gates and find out the history.
Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine,"This is truly an amazing shrine to visit in Kyoto,  There are thousands of vermilion Tori gates of various sizes to pass through to start your hike up the hill.  I first remembered the Tori gates that was featured in the 2005 movie Memories of a Geisha.  It is so much more sensational when viewed  in real time,  This is the head shrine of the Inari Shinto god of rice along with the fox deity that serves as guardian/messengers..  The shrine has existed over 1300 years in one form or another in this particular locale.  Our family has viewed smaller Inari shrines on our tour of Japan but this one is the most breathtaking .  Probably better photo ops when one visit early morning or evening.  This area has intriguing trails and some amazing view if you venture high enough.  We couldn't have asked for better late fall weather.  The foliage is stunning against the amazing backdrop of the main temple, tori gates and other lessor shrines.  You could easily spend a good part of a day just wandering and criss crossing trails."
Hot but sometimes it's worth the challenge,"Nice Shrine.  Watched a ceremony which was very nice and interesting.  Went up the hill on the hottest, muggiest day of the year.  Should have brought a change of clothing, a camelbak water carrier.  Free parking is a plus."
Amazing place,"My heart affair. Come early in the morning to avoid crowds and hot weather. Climb to the top, it's a beautiful path through the forest."
Kyoto at a (Tori) Gate.,Stunning view. We had a lovely walk that was enjoyable. Tourists let your do you own thing and everyone goes at their own pace. There were lots of rest stops and opportunities to go back down they mountain.
Beautiful Red Gates,This place is a must visit.  Feels very magical walking thru the red gates. its a long hike all the way to the top. Managed to go half way thru n it was worth the experience. The small little shops at the entrance makes it more fun.
The most photogenic temple of Kyoto,"If Kyoto was to be associated with one particular picture then it would definitely be a picture of the Fushimi Inari-Taisha. The trademark orange gates, countless of them, make for a fantastic hike through this spiritual place and encompass the wonderful Japanese combination of spirituality, mysticism and nature like no other place I know. Regardless of you being an Instagram poser, passionate hiker or religious person (or all in one), this place is a ""not-to-be-missed"" kind of landmark that is rightfully the #1 suggestion on tripadvisor for Kyoto. And Kyoto has a lot to offer..."
Entering to a Magical World through Torii Gates,"We visited Fushimi Inari Shrine in the afternoon and the grand entrance from Senbon Torii was like entering a magical world. We enjoyed hiking through the thousands of bright red torii gates. There were many fox statues along the path, which regarded as the messengers and guardian spirits of the Inari Shrines.  The whole pathway is torii-covered along the loop to the top of the mountain and it took around 2 hours to reach the summit. It was a truly mesmerizing experience. The path went through passing restaurants, viewpoints, and smaller shrines along the way to the top of the hill. We could get some brilliant images of torii gates without other people in them. The view of the sunset at the top of the hill made an everlasting memory and this was one of the amazing journeys we encountered in Kyoto."
Worth checking off the beaten path here -some cool things not on the main track,"Have been here twice; usually crowded but well worth it. Take a look down the side paths -there are some interesting site (wood carver's shack, other views of the city, etc). The food vendors as you exit towards the Keihan line are worth a look too."
Bring your climbing shoes,"Even with the crowds, and yes there probably will be crowds, at least at the base of the shrine, the Fushimi Inari experience is quite magical. What makes the Japanese shrines so interesting is the active participation that still goes on today, and that you can be a part of it after learning the proper protocol. The gates did not disappoint. And while I thought there were only several rows of them, turns out there’s a whole mountain of them! And what a climb it was. It definitely was a hike up a mountain, but truly worth it once we reached the summit. Just bring a bottle of water, take your time, wear comfortable shoes for walking up steps, and you can do it! Definitely worth summiting if you have the chance. But if you don’t feel like hiking, there are plenty of gates to walk through at the base of the shrine. Just know the higher you go, the less people there are to take in the magic of the mountain."
Get past the crowds!,"To get the best experience here, I'd highly suggest hiking up to the summit and back. You'll escape the insane crowds at the base, and find yourself having a very peaceful walk through this beautiful shrine. I'd also recommend checking out the various side shrines scattered throughout the path, they're quite stunning. Amazing views throughout, and by far my favorite place in Kyoto."
Exhausting and beautiful,"Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine is a must do for visitors to Kyoto to walk upward ever upward via the winding path through hundreds of Tori gates is an amazing experience, stopping along the way to take in the prayer stations some with dozens if not hundreds of small tori placed as votive offerings.We arrived late in the afternoon and had to almost sprint up the hill as the evening darkness closed in on us, but then the lights come on giving the pathway a surreal air as the light casts its shadows through the Tori Gates.It is an arduous walk so make sure you are fit and have good walking shoes but well worth the effort"
A must-see in Kyoto,If you are in Kyoto you should not skip a visit here. There is nowhere else like it and is truly iconic. I would recommend going early to avoid crowds. We didn't go all the way to the top as we were short on time but I would like to go back and go all the way up!
rainy afternoon,"I was going there on the raining afternoon. gotta buy the umbrella at the shop near the station... I regret to go there on the afternoon since I'm solo trip, i am too scare to going up until the top of the mountain (usually I'm not that scare going alone, but it was dark and nobody there) so maybe i will going there again sometime in the future."
A wonderful place to visit but go early and prepared for a good walk,"The Fushimin Inari-Taisha Shrine lived up to expectations but as one of the more famous sights in Japan we thought we should try to avoid the crowds by going early so we got an early train from Kyoto and aimed to get there around 7am. If you decide to visit I would strongly recommend you do the same because it was worth the early start.The start of the complex is only a short walk from the rail station and begins with the large and very obvious shrines of Fushimi Inari-taisha. The temptation was to stop here and start exploring but the goal was to walk up the hill on the 4km path through a seemingly endless procession of bright red vermilion Tori gates so we headed to the left of the large shrine at the entrance and began our ascent up to and through the gates. It is a beautiful place and a wonder through a camera viewfinder but finding a stretch without a stranger in the frame was only possible because we went early and the difference when we were making our way down was amazing. The people who set off only an hour or so after us had almost no chance to see it as we had and as it appears in the travel guides and by mid morning it had become a tunnel of people.The shrine was originally dedicated by the Hata family in the 8th Century and the bright vermilion tori have been erected and dedicated by individuals and communities over a long period. As you begin to walk through them look back and you will see the black painted dedications on the side facing up the slopes of Inari-san. There are plenty of small shrines and four or five larger shrines along the route often with stone foxes that people have occasionally adorned with small bright neck scarves and others are thronged with a multitude of miniature foxes arranged in ranks and offering great photographic opportunities. The fox is thought to be a messenger to the god and where you see one apparently carrying a key this is symbolic of the key to a rice granary.The track itself comes to form a loop so staying on what looks like the main route will eventually lead you back to a spot you recall from the journey up. We only encountered one real side track and it was fortunately very short. On the other hand what isn't so obvious is the top!There is a large shrine of clustered stone monuments at the summit and shortly beyond it you will find you are consistently descending. We first thought we had simply passed over a ridge on the way up and carried on a little way passing a few people who had clearly done the same thing and had turned to make their way back up, something we did a few minutes later.Our visit to the larger shrine near the entrance waited until the end and by then it had already attracted crowds but we were in no doubt that to appreciate not only the long tori enclosed track up the hillside but something of the peaceful atmosphere and the freshness of the early morning here made our early start a really good decision.If you do the same though it would be worthwhile taking both a bottle of water and some kind of light snack to eat along the way. There are very few places to eat once you start and  a couple more that sell drinks and ice cream but when we visited we found these didn't open until 9 or even 10am. With more people on the ascent by then these were also quickly getting busy as we were on our way back to town.  The complex itself is free to explore and there are no restrictions on photography beyond the usual courtesies if you want to include someone you don't know in your shot.To sum up this is a free site very worth visiting for it's history and beauty, easily reached from Kyoto and one that definitely merits an early start. There are few opportunities for food and drink along the way so it would be a good idea to pack a little something along with some water and you are basically climbing a hill so if you have mobility problems it might not be very accessible much beyond the start.I hope this is helpful to you on your visit and very much hope you enjoy it as much as we did."
Must do in Kyoto.,"The Shrine with orange pillars - known as Torri Gates.Shrine is open 24 hours. We got there around 9:30 AM, not too crowded. Entrance is right at the JR Inari Station. Headed up towards the mountain on the walking path, take a photo of the map provided near the entrance for better path planning. Learned that this shrine is dedicated to rice and sake. Take your photos while heading up as coming back down the crowds grew larger, (triple the amount of people one hour later). Always be respectful, this is a shrine with worshipers. You will see a lot of steps but it is a very leisure walk. We could see the Torii Gates at night from our Hotel."
Amazing Sunset view,"We went to FUSHIMI INARI TAISHA around 4pm. People are packed as usual. We went up the hill, almost to the top and saw the best place to watch sunset"
An All-Time Favourite,"A visit here involves a long uphill walk so bring good shoes and maybe a bottle of water.  This place is worth the trip and the exercise you'll get walking.  It's like no place I've ever been.  As you walk up hill, you are surrounded by wooden arches/gates painted red and spaced about two or less metres apart.  You feel like you're inside when you're outside surrounded by tiny shrines (including one to cats), relaxing woods and some amazing views of Kyoto.  Also completely free and, when you're finished, there are a bunch of locals selling freshly made Japanese treats.  You gotta go!"
Magical walk through time,"A must-visit place if you in Kyoto. You can walk a lot or a little but working your way through these gates is a truly mesmerizing experience. Hard to describe for me, but if you are in the area make the time to go experience this."
Favorite spot,"Absolutely beautiful and worth the trek. Also great to combine with Nara, on way back (same train). Can even go at sundown, when crowds thin out :)"
Amazing place! ,"My partner and I did this while we were in Kyoto for a short time. We heard going at dusk/night was better as all the tourists leave and locals are just left, which is what we did and what we got. After the train station, they had food stalls near the entrance which we encourage you to try. Fair warning there is a lot of walking involved so you need to wear proper shoes but the sites of Kyoto especially at night at the summit after walking through the torii gates is worth it."
Everything Orange!,"I don’t know the exact name of the color until I’ve watch vlogs, it’s actually vermilion! I didn’t expect a hike until the summit, I just followed the crowd and continue my journey up to the summit! This is one of a kind experience for me before the lockdown! My first time to see torii gates in person! It’s awesome!"
Amazing Torii all an entire mountain,One of the best shrines in Kyoto for a pleasant visit and even a photography session.  Best to go early or late to avoid the crowds.
What a beautiful trek!!!!,What a beautiful trek up this serene and picturesque mountain! The shrines at various points of the climb are a must stop for those wanting to take pictures. This hike is a little bit long but focus on the beauty of the trek and it really does not feel like effort!
Uniquely Spectacular Shrine!,"The Shrine is not only one of the most important Shinto Shrines in Japan, but also one of the most uniquely  spectacular shrines with over 5,000 Orange Gates.It's suggested to go there in the early morning as the shrine is located in a hilly area. However, there are several cafes and restaurants around the Shrines."
Magical. Utterly breathtaking.,"Utterly breathtaking. February is a perfect time to go.Less crowds,nice weather, blossom beginning to bloom. Perfect."
Beautiful and well worth the trek to the top!,"What a neat and lovely place! Yes, it can be crowded. We got there early and it wasn’t too bad; the crowds also thin out the higher you climb. When we were there, everyone was very considerate and respectful, both of the shrine itself and of their fellow visitors.The views are lovely and it was definitely worth the climb. When you descend, you can take the back path and avoid those who are climbing up. It’s faster and it makes the torii gate path less crowded for those who are still going up, too!"
Beautiful Shrine,"Don't miss this!  It is so amazing.  This is very well kept, great photo ops as well. The pathway is actually very long, but you dont have to walk the whole thing."
"Disconnect to reconnect with yourself, nature, the divine...","What you see in the pictures is just the very surface of this place. You can spend hours here. We recommend arriving early (at or just after sunrise) and making this a contemplative walk. Our group of four split up at times to make this our own experience - praying, humming, connecting with nature, or whatever else might suit you. The views are breathtaking and it's really special this space is open to the public. Highly recommend you snap a photo or two at the beginning and then put away the camera to discover so much more by showing up to the whole experience."
Amazing Tori gates,"This is an amazing shrine with thousands of Tori gates. The rows of them make an extra ordinary red/orange tunnel which is surprisingly relaxing as you walk through them. I didn’t have time to do the uphill walk but I am sure it would have been amazing.Beautiful area with plenty of souvenir shops at the exit, this is where I bought a lot of items for myself."
"A must see sight in Kyoto, and a chance to burn off a Japanese Kit Kat!","Really, one of the things to do in Kyoto. We were lucky in that things are not that busy here so the walk was not that crowded. Moderate, but made easier as it is paved and steps all the way. Maybe pop an ibuprofen if you have bad knees."
Must see!,"If you are in Kyoto, you have to visit this shrine! I was staying right down the street, so I did the climb more than once. It only took about an hour round trip for me, but I do hike often. Going up at night is worth it for the view of Kyoto from about halfway up. But do keep an eye out for wild boar! We saw two during our night hike, one of which was big enough to make me a little nervous."
Awesome view,"The walk up the fushimi inari was breathtaking both at night and in broad daylight. I would recommend to go at daytime because at night it might be too dark and also scary with the monkeys and boars closeby. You should try two distinct routes for going up and down again, one through the gates and the other down/or up the mountain on the more natural side which is much less crowded and gives you more insights on how beautiful it is as well."
Beautiful,"I loved this place. It is quite a climb and we didn't reach the top. The crowds thin out the higher you go and the tori gates get less and less well cared for, but the atmosphere gets better and more peaceful. It feels like a pilgrimage. Enjoyed seeing all the shrined on the way back down and meeting the shrine cats. It did not feel over commercialised like many tourist attractions both here and many other countries."
Exceeds expectations!,"No, they are NOT red, they are orange torri gates.... that said, they really are cool to stroll through, even in the rain and hoards of people. Arrive as early as possible, they are open 24 hrs.When you have reached the end of the 1st section of gates, there is a non-descript dirt trail veering off semi-steeply to your right - it leads to a small shrine and lovely bamboo grove 3 minutes away - worth a visit.There are many small shops leading from the Fushimi-Inari train station that sell the famous orange gates, in a variety of sizes and prices... we got one, and now that we have it on display back in Canada, we are so glad we did - it brings back great memories :)"
Iconic place,"Fushimi Inari-Taisha is one of the iconic images of Japan. And it's worth. I won't describe it since everybody has seen photos of it, but I'll give just a few tips. In the lower part, you'll find tons of people. Geting photos of the red toris it's almost impossible. But you can walk the path.. and as you walk, you'll be more alone, on your own. From the top, you have great views of Kyoto."
Stunning but overcrowded,"The swathes of orange gates really do have a stunning appearance. It's easy to see why people flock here, you might be waiting a while if you want that perfect picture without someone walking through.It's a nice hike to the top with some beautiful views and definitely worth the trek to escape the crowds in the main areas."
Fabulous,Beautiful place. Very lucky to have  visited on a quiet day.  Highly recommend you spend half a day here. Good f or the soul.
The famous Fushimi Inari,"Very impressive. There is a long way up to go, and the further up the less tourists. This is a good place to check out of the temples in Kyoto."
Magical place,"Tranquil and peaceful place with magical lighting at night. We came after the sun went down and it was not crowded and very beautiful, I’ve never seen anything like this before. We didn’t go to the very top because of the rain, but maybe next time..."
Don’t let rain stop you!,"We went on a day that it was raining and took an umbrella each. It was well worth it!! It was not overcrowded so plenty of opportunities for photos without other tourists in the background. It takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to get to the top of mt. Inari and back with a quick stop for a drink and souvenir shops. The train station is practically across the road and most people are heading there so follow the crowd and you’ll find it. Stop number 6 on the trail has an awesome view and a pit stop cafe/drinks/icecream. This is where most people stop and go back down and I wouldn’t have regretted turning back at this point but we pushed on to the top, which included lots of stairs, and at the very top there was not a designated good view spot, but a large collection of shrines. There was a small building that I don’t know if it opens to the public or not as it wasn’t open. The trail of tori gates and shrines really left you in awe and the forest was a refreshing contrast from the cityscape.My legs were jelly once we started descending (from the top) and I’d consider myself to be of average/above average level of fitness, which is why I think stop 6 on the trail is a good spot to turn back if I did it again"
Great shrine in south-east part of Kyoto,"We were there in the evening (about one hour before sunset, so the place definitely was not overcrowded. Orange/almost red Tori gates are absolutely unforgettable views. The whole shrine area is rather big. Tori gates lead to thetop of the hill, where there are a few platforms allowing for great views on Kyoto, other surrounding hills and even Osaka. Additionally, everywhere are everywhere stone fox statues, as the shrine is devoted to deity of foxes, which are the messengers observing people. Very nice place, with some quiet, contemplative places, especially when not overcrowded. Absolutely ""must see"" in Kyoto."
Always a great place to stop by. Mixed blessing with virus since currently less crowded,"Being that I lived in Japan, have always appreciated Japanese lore of the fox. The shrine is a good place to walk though, observe and contemplate the day"
Stairway to Heaven,Just go - the Torii Gates are quite the sight and the higher you climb the more the other tourists fall off so you have a better chance of getting a photo without others in the shot. The views are not spectacular but the experience will stay with you. Make sure to visit the cemeteries on your way down - it adds to the emotive atmosphere. Remember to look backwards as you climb!
Shinto Temple,Wonderful horse statue and examples of fox deities or avatars. Wonderful vermillion colored arches create a mystifying walk.
The Torii gates is one different experience,Heard much history about the Torii gates and why such color- all thought about in a sensible way. Great instagrammable event.
Worth the visit,"Quick ride from Kyoto station. The hike itself was nice and calm. It may be strenuous for some as a portion of it is uphill. No entrance fee was required. On your way up, there is a nice, little stop with a great views where you can take a break with ice cream, coffee etc. Upon reaching the top, do not expect spectacular views, there are none. Still a good experience."
Many Tori gates - nothing interesting,"Other than the many tori gates, this is almost the same as any other shrine.Many people are taking photos at the tori gates, so sometimes you have to wait for your turn to enter."
Love Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,We truly enjoyed visiting this Shrine as a family. When you first arrive you will see the beautiful Tori gate it is breath taking.
"Very interesting complex including the Twin ""tunnels""","It is one of the most visited shrine in Kyoto. Apart from the rows of Torii gate, there are also other shrines in the complex. The highlight of the shrine is the rows of torii gates though. Along the main path, there are around 1000 gates, all coloured in bright  Vermilion colours. Some of the gates have inscriptions, that people have carved in. The current structures date from the late 15th century. We were there late in the evening and dark and gives a different perspective and colours. You can hike up to the top of the mountain but it takes 2 hours to get there. Naturally, we could not do so. There are also many monkeys around and they can be quite nasty. Nevertheless it is a must if you are visiting Kyoto."
Mind boggling,"This is unquestionably one the highlights of any trip to Kyoto. We visited this shrine as part of a day long private guided walking tour. Fantastic, in every way..."
Beautiful shrine!,"We visited Fushimi Inari as part of a tour (highly recommend to do a tour so that you understand the stories and meanings behind each part of the shrine). This place is huge- it sits on a mountain and you can hike through the entire shrine. It was still crowded enough with locals and quite a lot of tourists despite all the virus hype, so I can’t imagine how much busier it is during normal tourist season! It is better to visit early in the morning. In one part of the shrine, there are small local stores, one of which sold boiled eggs- a must try! Delicious and boiled in the sacred waters of the shrine. Also, get ready for a major workout - if you plan to walk the entire length of it, there are many steps and lots of long, narrow trails."
Just beautiful. ,This was part of our tour I was looking forward to. Was crowded of course but what can you do. Didn’t get to see all of it because of the tour schedule.
Go early to enjoy,"If you go early enough, you get this most magnificent view of the amazing orange arches,.  Half way up on the right side is a side path that leads to a small temple and continues for many kilometres into the forest.  Definitely worth the peaceful walk"
Very moving,One of the most emotionally moving shrines that we visited. Can be crowded and touristy but just try to be in the moment beneath the vermillion torii. It’s magical.
Spectacular!,This is a bit of a hike and could be strenuous in hot weather.  It is well worth it though.  It is spectacular and you will wear out your camera while doing it.
solemn,"i came here around 5pm the place is so calming, meditating, i kind of think of my debts heree. . hahahhahaha. . i like the place good for internalizing also . ."
Amazing work of the monks,"Here we found hundreds of Tore gates each painted the lovely orange colour representing fire. There are shrines and wooded gardens around them that really gives the place a serenity. Worth the visit, be prepared to climb a few dozen steps like many temples and shrines they built them on a hill."
Grab your walking shoes and explore,"Kyoto has so many great places to visit and I was lucky enough to live there for 6 years so I got see so much. With so much to see, if you are a tourist it is hard to see it all.If you can, Fushimi Inari is a must. You will get to walk a lot, up the mountain with thousands of red gates, many cats, great nature and history mixed in with the commercial side of Japan. You can see that many of the gates are purchased or sponsored by many commercial organisations.A great day out, so if you have time, its worth the visit."
The Most Beautiful Shrine in Japan,"This shrine is spectacular!  If you only have time to explore one, choose the Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine. Home to 100 orange gates, it is hard to describe..you have to see it to believe it.  Make sure to leave enough time to buy souvenirs. We loved it!"
"it was a 24 year revisit with a patient guide to these old shrines, temples","great if u are a keen photographer, too many tourists even in winter from mainland china be4 the coronavirus pandemic"
Pay your respects to the god of rice :),If you want the full cultural experience then do the full hike. Its a decent walk with lots of stairs. If you're only in it for the photos then you can do a short version of only about 10 minutes if you just want a sample or are not able to do the whole walk.Allow time to browse the shops at the bottom.Train station right by the site makes visiting very easy. Lots of food available in the surrounding streets too.
Wonderful Cultural Experience,Awesome! Peaceful! Respectful! There is much to see and experience here. There is quite a bit of walking and many steps to climb. It takes almost the entire day to experience this location.
Take the photos but don't go up to the top.,"Fushimi Inari Shrine is definitely worth going for taking selfies with the Tori gates, it's a way way long walk up the mountain. Once you reach a stop point where the lookout is, just go have a look, take some pics then go back down coz there is absolutely nothing to see up the top, no view over looking the city or anything, nothing worth the effort. Just go back down and keep your energy to your next destination. And no matter how busy and crowded people are, you will always find a spot to take pics of the tori gates without people as long as you are patient."
Must see,The climb to the top was quite a hike but definitely worth it! The scenery from the top is amazing and the shrines itself is something you have to see.
A must visit,Make sure to buy the fox crackers outside the temple - yummy and made before your eyes. open 24 hours. I want to go back!
Best Kyoto Attraction,"This shrine is unlike anything you will see anywhere else in the world.It is stunning, it is vast, and it is in a beautiful location.Very easy to get to, just 2 train stops from Kyoto Station (covered by JR Travel Pass) and easy to find when you get off the frain.To walk right to the top and back will take about an hour, it is a decent workout but not too arduous.  It's set in a beautiful forest on the mountainside, and it's a very pleasant place to visit.  There are literally hundreds of side-shrines to visit, and the photo opportunities are limitless.It is a bit crowded at the start, but it seems that most people don't do the full circuit, so if you just keep walking you will soon be able to enjoy the site without crowds.It is a wondrous place.And it's free!"
Beautiful shrine,Getting around the place enjoying their beautiful shrine. Getting up the hill and walking down to try some snack stall.
superlative in every way,"the senbon torii paths are lovely by themselves, but there's something truly wonderful and breathtaking about this temple complex. you can avoid the crowds by visiting before 9am or (like we did) after 3pm. there's always someplace serene to catch your breath amidst the forest, though, no matter how crowded the main areas are. remember when you're here that this is a place of pilgrimage and worship, so be sure to conduct yourself accordingly."
Quintessential Japanese experience,"Beautiful temple, long uphill trek is well worth it with fantastic photo ops and a spiritual oasis even amidst the tourist traps. Definitely worth aeeing"
Long Trek,"Be prepared for a long trek, A lot of it up hill, plenty of uneven steps, But worth the trip.Plenty of shrines along the way."
Cool place to be in Kyoto,"There are a lot of stair, be ready to do some hiking/climbing. Went there around 9 am and it was very crowded. Other than that, had a really great experiece there."
Japan Trip,"Me and my wife visit this special Shrine on our second day in, and it was very long day as this Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine in Kyoto is very huge and to discover it takes long time, and you have to be physically fit as the walking paths are ups and downs and mostly if your not fit will be a challenge to discover the beauty of this place. all the orange colored entrance ""Shrine"" are individual donated by different personals. I was very pressed of the landscape and how the arrangements of the Shrine been set and the explanation.  I recommend to have a guide if you are none Japanese in order to understand the writings on the Shrine. Should not miss to visit this beautiful Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine."
"Really cool place, nowhere else like it",There is no place like it. Thousands and thousands of torii Gates on a mountain path. Come early not just to avoid crowds but greet some friendly cats. Recommend hiking up to the lookout.
Be prepared to walk some stairs!,It's a lot of stair climbing but worth it if your up for the hike. Great views and it should be on your list of in town. Easily accessible via the Nara train line with you can use your JR pass to ride for free
amazing construction..great for photos..if you can compete w others for spots..,"bloody amazing place..but crowded...better go early..to avoid the hundred of people slowing down the walking to take selfies(annoying)..but has kind of magical peaceful  sensation..nice to get out of the colums ""tunnel"" and look from outside..some hidden interesting areas..but lots of warnings signs regards to ""wild"" monkeys..what brakes your adventure spirit!..but worth a visit..."
Beautiful to visit at sunset,"Open to public at all times, free and close to the Inari station, few minutes away from Kyoto. Totally worth the visit, we were lucky that there were not many visitors at that time."
Wonderful,"A great piece of Japanese culture, ideal for holiday photos. Nice and quiet early in the morning before the crowds arrive."
"Huge, Crowded, and Free","This shrine is very crowded because it is famous and have no entrance fee. But if you walk bit further you can enjoy this shrine, because most  of them only want to take photo in the famous torii. The path is actually quite long and steep, it is larger than expected so allocate  2-3 hours if you want to walk from start to finish."
Impressive,"My second visit to this shrine and it was still impressive and memorable. This time we chose to walk all the way to the top and it was certainly worthwhile. Along the way there will be times when it is so crowded with other tourists, but then you will find times when it feels like you have the place to yourself, so make the most of those times! Spectacular!"
Amazing Visit,"Amazing experience and a must do activity when in Kyoto - be warned it takes a good hour or two to get to the top, but it's a fun trek! Highly recommend!"
Keep going and the crowds do thin out ,"Despite tourist numbers being low,  Fushimi was still extremely crowded but the higher you go the less selfie sticks there are. We got a bit lost, the signs aren’t so helpful at the halfway point but we did seem to go to the top along a path not many others used as the descent was busier, then we ended up going through some pretty back streets at the end. I’m glad it was a cold day, it was hot work. I did see several people struggling so be sure you can manage it. The kids whinged a bit but did enjoy it overall & forgot all grumbles exploring the food stalls on the way back to the station!"
"Must go up 10,000 steps","I would recommend hiking all the way on top of Mount Inari, and not just taking photos of the vermillion gates. Older Japanese people have more energy than me! Hehe"
Night time trip,We went here at night and it was a fabulous experience! The poles cast shadows in the light. A highlight of our trip.
"Lucky time of the year, not too crowded and beautiful Shrine","Great visit, well worth the time and the long walk! Don’t despair after the first climb It is something unique in the world! Simply amazing"
Meh,It’s cool for the gates and the little shrines on the way. Once you get to the top there’s a  view of the city. But not my favorite. It’s very busy so hard to get pictures. Not sure it was worth my time.
Oh my it’s busy and not much fun....,"So this is the “Instagram” picture everyone wants. Thousands of bright orange Torii heading up the mountain. It’s not much fun as a result. There are a few great picture opportunities and it is probably much nicer to spend the 2 hours or so and walk to the top. We didn’t have time unfortunately. It’s one of the places to visit so I won’t put you off, but don’t expect too much and you’ll be far happier."
Impressive temple,"This is a large temple with a walkway of tori gates leading up the hill, which is an impressive sight. It is a very popular and busy place, but the further up the hill you go the less people you see. It is very close to the JR Inari station so this is a very convenient way to get there. There are a series of gift shops and food stalls leading from the temple down into the town."
Fushimi is over rated ,I think only people who believe in shrines should visit for us it was tiring and the views from the top of the mountain well nothing to write home about. Waste of time.
Thousands Torii Gates,"Iconic landmark for Kyoto.Many orange torii gates, it goes on and on.Very good exercise to stay away from city and walk up the hill.There are many food stalls before the temple, so u can come have a bite before or after the hike."
Great must do activity,This is an iconic place to visit whilst in Kyoto. Beautiful picture opportunities but a long climb so make sure you bring comfortable shoes!
Tough Climb - Worth it for Lookout Spot!,"Make sure to get there early before the crowds come! We started climbing before 7am and there were several people at the base and already climbing as well. We were in a little bit of a hurry so we hiked straight up and down, stopping only for a picture or two, and we were able to complete it in an hour and 15 minutes. The climb is tough - stairs on stairs on stairs! We lost most of our layers on the way up and that’s saying a lot since it was around 33 degrees fahrenheit that day. But if you are able to do it, it’s pretty neat. The only frustrating part was that the top of the mountain literally had a piece of paper that said, “TOP.” There were no rewarding views at the top, which was a bummer, so make sure to take the time and hit the lookout point on the way up or down for a nice picture."
Enlightening,"Visiting here is like visiting some great catherdal in Europe. You can feel the history, and the spiritual connection here to the mountain. It's open 24 Hours a day, so you can visit in the day time, the night, or early morning. Be warned, at night time there are monkeys (Aggressive) and Boars (Also aggressive ) That wander the area. It's nicer to go during the day since you can enjoy and experience the red gates. But also the busiest."
Pure perfection!,"Went there early morning, alone, and had two hours for myself. I believe that experience would be totally different seeing it packed with tourists, because this place gets really packed. This is a must. There is a lot a walk around, but it is so magical that you don't want to stop. Follow the path to the top, and don't feed monkeys."
A must see! ,You must head here if coming to Kyoto. Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds! It’s remarkable to see and also a work out. You can get drinks along the way as there are lots of little places to stop.
Fascinating climbing over Kyoto,"We went for the climbing on Fushimi Inari on a very hot day in Summer and our daughters were reluctant to go over. However, after few steps under the orange arches they became enthusiast and did all the climb up and down (probably ca 2.5 hours with few stops for photos). There are literally thousands of wooden arches and the atmosphere in the forest is magical. Unmissable if you are in Kyoto!"
Great,"This shrine was beautiful! The walk to the summit is quite long and challenging (about 80 flights of stairs) although you can walk as little or as much as you like. So if you are strapped for time, I personally do not believe that you will be missing out in any way by not completing the whole walk- even just walking the first few hundred metres is an accurate representation of what the whole walk is like. There are some shrines at the top of the mountain too. There are great food stalls at the entrance as well and some souveneir shops"
The Highlight of my life!,"I cannot express enough how massive the site is. Allow yourself at least 3 hours if you want to hike the entire Shrine. Wear comfy shoes, tennis shoes and bring water with you and be ready for 12, 000 steps. This shrine is massive and crowded but somehow very peaceful and beautiful."
Beautiful Shrine,"You could spend all day following the trails to the top of the mountain. We went only about a third up the mountain, but it was beautiful and peaceful. Each gate is donated by a family across Japan. It may have been less crowded the further up you go, but we didn’t have enough time. Also great street food/snack vendors at the bottom of the shrine."
A must for visitors to Kyoto and free to access!,"This is an amazing place - miles and miles of orange shrines climb the mountain and make for an incredible visit.The shrine is free to access, located very near a train station in Kyoto and visitors can downed as much time as they like at the site.We opted for the full ascent of the mountain, which comprises a circular path up and then down a large number of steps. Aside from the huge number of orange frames through which visitors walk, there are a number of small shrines to either side of the pathway, most of which feature a number of smallIntricate stone carvings.For those who don’t fancy the full climb, they should at least aim to get to the halfway viewing point, which offers great views out over Kyoto.The forest setting makes for a very zen experience all round.  A must for any visitor to Kyoto..."
Incredible place!,"This is one of the best places to visit in all japan for sure! It was a really good experience, perfect to go with family and friends and easy to get there."
Thousands of Torris,"The Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari, the god of rice, sake and prosperity and patron of business, merchants and manufacturers. The shrine is at the base of Mount Inari and includes many smaller sub shrines. At the shrine’s entrance we saw the Romon (tower) Gate, which is the main gate, and was built in 1589 thanks to donations from the samurai warlord and ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. We noticed stone statues around the main shrine that appeared to be unusual looking dogs. There were dozens of these in various poses. We learned that they were foxes. Foxes or kitsune in Japanese are regarded as the messengers of the gods. Some of the stone foxes even had keys in their mouths. Those were the keys to the rice granaries which they were protecting.The main attraction at this stop are the thousands of torii shrine gates. There are more than 11,000 of them. Each of the famous torii shrine gates has been donated by an individual or a Japanese business in the hope of receiving good luck and fortune. The name of the donor is inscribed in black ink on the back of each gate. The cost of donating the torii starts around $400,000 JPY ($4,000 USD) for a small sized gate and increases to over 1,000,000 JPY ($10,000 USD) for a large gate.The shrine is recognized by UNESCO and is certainly worth your visit."
Unique Experience,"This is one of the must visit places in Kyoto. Getting here is kind of weird with it being just a few blocks away from the city, but when you see it, it is unmistakable. Beautiful place to explore and take photos. When we went there were tons of food stalls that had a lot of delicious food as well."
Japan 2020,"A ""must visit"" when in Kyoto.You can go up halfway but the best part comes afterwards on the ""round-trip"" to the top and down again. Less tourists there."
Free and fantastic,Plan to spend some extra time here so you can keep walking until the crowds abate.  Spectacular sight.
Walking up hill while it snowed,"It was my dream to come here one day, so when we were there early (8:00) to beat the crowd, I was so happy that there were only a couple of people. Plenty of opportunity to take photos, especially if you go a bit uphill. A lot of people stay at the beginning. We walked through the gates and it suddenly started to snow a bit. It was truly magical. We went all the way up to the summit. Quite the hike but as long as you rest a bit every now and again, I would recommend to go all the way up. The view and the shrines are so pretty."
Great orange walkway,"This was pretty good, the seemingly endless orange walkways. Loads of people. Didnt see any of the much warned about monkeys"
For less crowds head up the mountain!,"This shrine was one of the highlights of our time in Kyoto. Its much more extensive than we realized, with walking trails way up into the mountain with lookouts over the city. Most tourists get stuck at the entrance taking their selfies but the crowds are wild here and you cannot get a photo of you without 10 other people walking in it. But if you continue on the walking trail and dont turn back to the entrance at the first trail (which is about a 10 minute loop) but continue up the mountain, they still have the orange wood structures the whole way up and there were times where we didnt see anyone else for 5 whole minutes! So if you are visiting I would highly recommend take some extra time and do the longer trail to enjoy some peace and tranquility which is supposed to be the point of this place anyway. And some people-free photos never hurt either :)"
Beautiful Place-Give Yourself Time!,"We went to Kyoto between Christimas and New Year's and went here as part of an afternoon tour through Sunrise Travel. We were late for the tour and had to take a cab to catch up to it so we walked through this area very quickly.It is beautiful with all of the gates and as you would expect, it is very crowded especially when we were there. I expect that it is crowded all of the time as it is worth the trip.Very colorful gates and a very lively area.We were an hour late so our tour really spent more time here than we did, but although we were rushed, it is a beautiful place to go.. There is a big shopping area nearby but we did not get there, We will return on our next trip to this area."
A New Years Must,"We walked the shrine path- gorgeous orange gateways and joined in the traditional walk with those who came on pilgrimage to set the tone of the new year, It is tradition to walk the gateway path to bring in good luck and abundance for your business. There are older shrine that have a powerful prsence not to be missed- watch out for the monkeys"
Great Experience. ,"The shrine is a great experience and workout if you're keen to go to the top.Located directly outside the Inari train station (JR line, 2 stops from Kyoto). We got there early around 7.30am there was maybe 2 other groups ahead of us. Best time to get some unrestricted photos of the Tori gates. Now be warned it is alot of stairs so be prepared for a workout. We were up and down in 1.5hrs and we weren't rushing, stopping alot for photos. Once at the bottom again there was a small food market setting up. We stayed here for breakfast and walked the market. Souvenirs are available from here too. Overall, loved it. Great morning activity. Go early, the hikes pretty and peaceful"
Mysterious and Magical,"We arrived at Fushimi Inari around 6pm, so it's not yet that dark, but not really light as well... a twilight of sorts and it was magical (check the photo). I recommend visiting at around this time as there's not much crowd, plus the view is so, shall we say ""instagram-worthy"". You can actually feel that this a holy place. Japan has many beautiful temples, and we've visited quite a few, but this is probably one of the best we've seen."
Gates kept me coming back,"Fushimi Inari made me visited it 3 times. The gates were so cool, mysterious and instagramable. The shrine was very nice. Even the street food were so delicious from slice pork belly, mochi, chicken, and so on"
Definitely a must to visit in Kyoto!,"Another one of Kyoto's amazing gems. The Inari gates you see all over Instagram and social media are located through out the mountain. Best advice is to visit early if you want nice pictures without people in the background. The hike up was quite the workout but there are some shops along the way for refreshments and some souvenirs. Although I wouldn't climb the whole mountain again, I would definitely visit just to enjoy the area."
Must Visited Place,"This is mandatory place for first timer.Always crowded.Many locals too, because the temple have a regular schedule of praying time"
Magical!,"This was the place i wanted to go and didn't want to miss. I loved loved loved it! Going early, in the mist of the morning almost empty. It was just beautiful."
Amazing! Definitely worth the visit,This should be on your list to visit! It's a lovely place to walk around and is a lot bigger than you would imagine. We got the train here and the station is directly opposite and about a minute walk away. Walking around this site is really nice and there were hardly any crowd's so made it even nicer. It does show a circle for you to walk around but the last bit is a path through the street so I would recommend to double back on yourself and go through it twice. Lovely place to visit
"Nice to walk through, but","It really nice to walk trough the area, especially trough the torii gates. The only negative thing was the hustle and bustle in general, because during my visit it was very crowded.  So I didn‘t spend that much time in there and increased the pace a bit."
Shrine On ,"A long walk if you can tackle the whole mountain unfortunately we only made it half way but still a nice experience , good culture and a few photo spots ... you will need to time it right tho as there are lots of visitors here A"
Early morning to avoid crowds and free!,Great photo opportunities and a bit of early morning exercise.  There are several temples to see as you go round.  It was easy to get to on a train from Kyoto Station only 10mins.
The Thousand of Torii Gates,"Detour from Osaka, more or less an hour of train ride to the Fushimi-Inari Station. Definitely one of the key attractions when you think of Kyoto. Crowded as expected. And the thousands of tore gates were definitely spectacular."
Top shrine in kyoto,Had been looking forward to this visit for years and it did not disappoint.Be sure to wear walking shoes.
Fabulous- and keep walking,"After a 30 year relationship with Japan, I am not sure how I have never been here.My hint, go early.I arrived at about 8:30 on a Saturday and by the time I got up and down (I ate icecream at the top and had a sit down to admire the scenery),which was around 10:45/11, it was packed.My advice, keep walking, so you can get decent photos, and save some room in your belly for the little street food market at the bottom. Easy access from Kyoto by train."
Torri Torri!! ,"There are many temples and shrines in Japan. Fyi, Temples are for Buddhist worship while shrines are for Shintoism worship. Fushimi Inari is therefore a Shinto shrine but unique with its never ending sea of iconic red/orange torri style gates arching over the pathway which in turn weaves its way up the mountain - over 10,000 gates to give you an idea of the treat you are in for. Given the path is up a mountain, the shrine is more than a building but an experience with the environment. Parking was easy enough and close for our guide to find.  As you approach the entrance to the shrine - it will immediately strike you as spectacular. There is a grand avenue with lanterns on either side that leads to a large and beautiful torri gate. Lots of photo ops in all directions. I recall there was also a Shinto ceremony you can observe if you are there at the right time. Fox sculptures are another highlight from the entrance to the shrine and as you walk among the well kept and concrete path. They do have a significance you can learn about when you visit. The feeling is surreal as you walk up through the torri gates lining the pathway like trees and all shades of red and orange, accentuated by hanging lanterns of similar hue. The pathway sometimes opens up and is dotted  by the occasional gift shop, lake views and cemetery. You may also see workmen maintaining the torri gates demystifying its presence as the older wooden ones tend to rot. Throughout the shrine and it’s satellite buildings are a sea of red decorations. If you want to walk all the way to the top (I didn’t) and assuming you are reasonable fit, our guide said to plan for about 3hrs. One pleasant surprise is how friendly the Japanese at this busy tourist sight. One old lady in particular sat making paper cranes to give to the children without wanting anything in return. This shrine is unique to other Shinto shrines in Japan with its thousands of torri gates one after the other and well maintained to be a consistency of colour. It’s definitely a must see in Kyoto. There is a scene from the movie in Memoirs of a Geisha that was filmed there and showcases the steps leading to the torri gates. We did this shrine as part of a Kyoto tour with Novaland Tours who were beyond excellent in organizing the trip.  We didn’t experience much crowds that others have reported on and I attribute this to Novaland’s advice as they put the itinerary together with specific times to avoid crowds. So they had encouraged me to move things around to my original schedule with this in mind. Other places we visited in Kyoto that I would recommend are Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, the famous Kinkakuji or Golden Temple, Samurai and Ninja Museum with the add-on lessons in samurai and ninja techniques, Togetsukyo Bridge and a cultural night show at Gion Corner."
Very interesting,A sight to see when in Kyoto. Make sure you come very early so you can get better picture with lesser crowd.
The photos say it all,This shrine offers endless steps up to the top of the hill with gates most of the length.  A busy place (at least at weekend) but worth the effort.  Easily reached by JR only a couple of stops from Kytot to Inari.  You do not need to go to the top to experience the shrine but the higher you get the less the people!
Beautiful,"Beautiful shrines and gates, plus the mountain makes a wonderful hike if you have time. There's even a bamboo forest here for great photo ops"
❤️,"It was night time when we went, so we had it to ourselves for taking photos though cannot appreciate other surroundings."
Uncountable Tori gates and a climb to its peak,A tedious climb up the steps all the way to the peak (~400m) in about 2hrs but sadly you don’t get very good views at the top but an achievement though. You get to see some souvenir shops along the way up and back down. The only good thing is that the higher you climb the lesser the crowd and more opportunities to get a good photo. There is also a string of food stalls on your way to Fushimi Inari. The bacon wrapped rice ball with kimichi was delicious. The Takoyaki balls were nicely done but the octopus inside does not taste that fresh. You can also find an orange juice stall that juice the orange within while keeping the whole orange peel.
"Crown jewel of Kyoto attractions, the beauty just goes on and on","My absolute favorite attraction in Kyoto, and maybe all of Japan. When you enter Fushimi Inari, you are greeted with the tori gates with a big orange building with shinto foxes on both sides. This is the iconic picture of it, and one might be forgiven for thinking this is where it ends. However the beauty of Fushimi Inari lies beyond the entrance, and moving past it to the other temples on the long set of stairs. Neither me or my wife are hikers, but we absolutely loved going up Fushmi Inari as we kept being greeted by ever more imposing thousands of tori gates. There are multiple temples along the way to the summit, which in itself are beautiful and worth stopping and paying homage. You will keep seeing the beautiful fox statues all across the hike too. Unfortunately our feet were too sore from all the walking in Kyoto, Osaka that we stopped a little bit short of the summit and never reached Mt. Inari.At the base and even along the hike, there are food stalls selling local food items. We didn’t grab a bite, but if you’re adventurous it could be worth a try. With it’s free price label, I’d rank it Kyoto’s must-visit attraction and one of the “shouldn’t miss” places"
Missed it,"As we walked out from Fushimi Inari Station, we followed the crowds and took some pics of the big lovely temple in front of the station, with its majestic torri gate.Then, we walked along a small street with many quaint Japanese houses and came across a food section where many varieties of food were sold.  After enjoying some food and resting, we walked on.  We failed to find the entrance to the orange torri gates and Shrine.  We tried asking some locals but were not successful with the directions given.In the end, we gave up because we visited Arashiyama Bamboo Forest that morning and our legs were so tired.We immediately regretted not persevering as we entered the JR train to return to Kyoto, but it was too late.  Beats us how we could've failed to find it when so many others mention its proximity to the station.Anyway, we told ourselves, this would be a good reason to come back to Kyoto again, to visit Fushimi Inari Shrine!  But we must be fully prepared with really clear directions on how to reach it."
Mountain top - kids,Came with our 16 month toddler. We made it all of the top while carrying the stroller (not kidding).  I felt like I was going to die climbing all those stairs up and down.  Absolutely incredible sight and journey but make sure your kids can handle about 3 hour journey on their own!
HELP! Be careful of angry wild boars!,"We decided to visit Fushimi inari at night. It wasnt scary at all. however, we managed to climbed our way to 1/2 way to the top just a little after Mitsusuji and a wild boar saw me. it screamed an angry voice and ran towards me. I paniced and quickly ran back down. ""That's it, Im outta here"" I said."
To the Top (Haikyuu reference),"Been here twice and on my 2nd visit, I finally had the time to try and go to the top. It took me a lot (I mean a lot of stops) to reach the praying area to the top but the experience was worth it (not necessarily the view).I love the Kyoto merch around the area as it captures ancient Japan."
A fabulous Shinto Shrine and grounds,"Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine is positively breathtaking, and also extremely popular! As you head farther towards the top, the crowds thin out and the views out over Kyoto are impressive. Note that the little refreshment/gift shops you see as you go along the path are all owned by different families and offer different merchandise. One has a post office where you can purchase postage, get a special post mark from Fushimi-Inari, and mail post cards. Go early if possible!"
Walk around at Fushimi Inari-Taisha,"In place more identically with orange gate. Many people very insteresting to this place since entrance until end of that area. You can enjoy arrround this place, hunting food or trying yukata."
Cool shrine and decent walk,Worth checking out. We did the walk to the top of the mountain. It's pretty much more of the same from a shrine perspective but you get a good view of Kyoto and can see Osaka in the distance on a clear day. The walk up the mountain has a fair few steps so that's worth taking into account.
Beautiful shrine and easy to get to!,"This shrine was very easy to access ... the entrance is literally across the street from the metro station, and we had japan rail passes so the trip was free for us. The shrine is beautiful .. if you arrive early enough the crowds aren't too bad. As we were leaving the crowds were growing, but we really enjoyed walking through the shrine. The orange posts were so unique and beautiful to see in person. We only spent a couple of hours here but it's worth a visit."
Start your Kyoto experience here,This is a great way to begin your Kyoto experience.Use the JR Nara line and go to Inari station from Kyoto station- very close.There is a fair amount of easy climbing but well worthwhile experiencing the orange Nori gates .Go early as the grounds get super crowded by late morning This is a must see venue in Kyoto
Photographer's delight,"This area is 5 minutes walk from the  JR station but it can get very crowded during the day as the tour buses come in The are a is open 24/7 and there's no entry charge if you don't mind crowds then go during the day ,but we found that around 10pm was the best time to visit  and take a few photos and there's a good  view over Kyoto from the top."
Fasinating Fushimi Inari-Taisha,It was a short train trip from Kyoto Station to JR Inari Station. We visited the shrine in the evening. The entrance gate looked beautiful. The orange torri gates were fascinating. Couldn't stop taking photo.
Beautiful Views and Experience,"What a beautiful walk through the orange ""gates"". I wish we had more time to make it to the top. Stunning views from the higher points, makes for beautiful photos and an absolute must in Kyoto. We were lucky to be there in late December when the crowds were minimal."
Quick Visit after Bamboo forest,It was fun exploring area. It was late when we got here and did not have the chance to reach the temple at the end of these gates.
By night ,It’s so popular to visit this place and cause of that really crowded. That’s why we went there a second time in the late evening and enjoyed that a lot and could taken great pictures
Top Kyoto place to see on a visit ,"Top place to visit in Kyoto. Free entrance (it is respectful to make an offering) and parking. Main temple complex at base of hill then its 12,000 steps up a pretty arduous climb to the top of the hill through the 10,000 gates. Lots of small shrines all the way up and around the main path. Some great views down into Kyoto and the  surroundings hills on the way up. Could not see any access route for less abled visitors and this is a fairly long steep steps climb. Really interesting and colourful place ..lots of places for food and souvenirs up and down the route. The place gets really busy, my guide told me the site is open 24 hours a day?!. Definitely a must see part of any Kyoto visit."
Tourist Central!!! ,"Tourists arrive by the bus load and it’s like a production line. Out of frustration we deviated and took a small path to the summit (climb via the right hand side of the mountain...anti-clockwise) fortunately it was the best decision - we could reach the summit without being pushed and pulled all over the place and along the way there were stretches with nobody - making for some great photos!! It was a longer journey (allow more than 1,5 hours) but worth it. All said with some effort you can enjoy but for sure bring plenty of patience!!!!"
"12,000 steps - 10,000 torri gates","This is a must do while in Kyoto. We did the full loop/hike all the way to the top of Mt Inari. It’s 12,000 steps, and quite the uphill hike. The torri gates that line the trail are so cool to walk through. There are shrines and small shops along the way. Bring water and good shoes! The entire hike takes about 2 hours"
Arrive early and hike the trail!,Make sure to arrive before 8 to avoid the crowds.  the trail itself is around three miles and goes up through the mountains with orange torii Gates the entire path.  The views of Kyoto from the top are stunning!  The trails very peaceful if you don't have a ton of people around you.  They're wonderful cats most of them belong to the shop owners along the way.  This is a photographer's Paradise
Kyoto must visit,"I came here in the afternoon, and sadluy the stalls are closing down already. Plus the sun is setting so pictures are hard to take with phones. I suggest coming here early in the morning or while the sun is up. It's crowded here for people come and pray plus tourists gather to walk. The train station is designed differently. Try the inari here it's good. Oh yeah there's a lot of souvenir shops that sell cute stuffs. From socks to magnets keychains name stamp and furoshiki napkins."
Unforgetible experience,Try to climbe up to the mountain to enjoy beautiful sunset! Experience the unique atmosphere when walking through the mountain route during the time. The reflection of the light is amazing! Highly recommanded!
Hiking in the dark,"This was our last stop in Kyoto as we noted that it was open 24 hours! We got there after 8 pm and there were not many people around but the whole area was lighted enough for you to walk around and hike! We learnt that there are over 1000 Shinto shrine archways. As we started, we were really fascinated by the view and also managed to have a glimse of Kyoto night scene from the top. We walked up to the summit which is 233 m high. A bit tiring but it's worth it. It's almost 11 pm when we finished. There were 5 of us but we were not alone. I believe it is a safe hike."
Different Experience at Night,"We went for a night trip to this shrine and trust me, the atmosphere is totally different. It was quieter and more peaceful at night plus the lighting around the gates were simply splendid. If you’re looking to pray/give respects to the temple, you should definitely hit up after 7pm"
Loved the aura of the place. Worth walking to the top.,"The place had a positive aura about it. The gates were magnificent and the cultural significance of the gates indicating fulfilled wishes added to the hope and positivity of the place. Breath taking views, lots of good eating and souvenir shops around.Well connected by the train."
Must see,Th is place is amazing. Went on a Saturday so very busy - markets are fantastic and the BBQ stalls are sensational!!!!
One of the highlights of Kyoto,Wear comfy shoes and make the effort to climb to the top. There are interesting little graveyards along the way. We went at sunset and were not disappointed. Many photo opportunities.
Iconic touristy spot in Kyoto,"A trip to Kyoto is incomplete without visiting Fushimi Inari Taisha!From Arashimaya station, we took the JR train to Inari Station for our next itinerary, the Fushimi Inari Taisha. We started our walking tour from the shrine which sits at the base of the Mt Inari by walking through the thousands of vermillion torri gates which straddle a network of trails behind its main building. In fact the vermillion torri gate is the icon of Japan. On the way, there are many fox statues across the shrine grounds. We climbed up to Mt Inari which is 233m above sea level. It was just another 15 minute walk before reaching the peak, but we abandoned it as it was getting dark and there were not many visitors going up. So we decided to descend and walk back to Keihan Inari Station. It’s a good walk with fresh air and some beautiful scenery along the way. On the way to the Keihan Inari Station, there are many hawkers selling various type of local food. We tried the grilled Wagyu beef before boarding the train to Gion-Shijo Station."
Make the effort and walk to the top!,"Very, very busy around the entrance to the shrine but the crowds soon thin out as you ascend. A stunning site once away from the crowds, it makes for pleasant walk . Allow 2-3 hours to the top and back"
Very busy even at night ,I have no idea how people get these gorgeous photos with just themselves.  We went at night because we ran out of time. There's a colony of cats that  live there that we got to cuddle which was cute.
Unique Fushimi Trisha shrine on Mt. Imari,Unique traditional structures on long winding slopes of Mt Imari. Nice pond scenery near the top of the mountain.
A good walk,"Rising up the mountain, this is a huge and spectacular temple.Climbing to the highest peak is not for the faint hearted. But half way up you get great views of Kyoto."
Good place to go ,"30-45 min walk along the trail to the view point , if you go after 4pm less crowd and better. Really amazing shrine."
We had a great time,Definitely this is a place to not to miss when in Kyoto.... we were luck it was not so crowed because I´ve seen pictures where it was completely full. Wonderfull experience. The energy and calm you can feell it..... priceless.
A must visit but very crowded ,"Yes, one must visit Fushimi Inari if in Kyoto. It’s beautiful and impressive. Best time to visit is early in the morning to avoid buses  of tourists.  Wear comfortable walking shoes."
"Lots of people, but still well worth the adventure","When we started the climb the area was packed with people. Everyone was trying to get their selfies and I thought this is going to be horrendous. However, we took the path less traveled through a bamboo grove around the back of the mountain and up a very steep track. The good news is, when we reached the top, the crowd had completely evaporated. As most people don't seem to make it past the lookout halfway up. When we then went back down, via the conventional path, we were delighted that we almost had the path to ourselves. Until the lookout where once again we met the masses. Still this is a truly amazing venue."
Busy but a great walk,"The beginning of this walk will be packed to the brim with people but the further you climb the mountain, the quieter it’ll get. Get ready for a lot of stairs if you want to head to the top, but it’s worth it for the tranquility along the way."
Great shrine to be at ease ,What a great place to visit when you want some tranquillity time. The closest station I believe was Inari station. You can walk to the top which takes just under an hour I but I’m slightly unfit.Take some water with you as you can buy water and other soft drinks near the top cost a bit more money because you’re quite limited on what you can buy at that stage.You could even buy a shrine mini replica which the sellers will put the date that you came with your name I believe as well but I can’t say about the name as I am going by when I bought it 10 years ago but they are still selling the same articles.Once at the very top as you’re coming down feel free to take pictures as it is such a wonderful view as you can see on my photo.At the bottom you can get trinkets have a good luck charms and I was just coming here at least one time in your life.
Feeling authentic at Fushimi Shrine,"Loved this Shrine and I  made a wish while I washing my hands and my mouth at the holy well ! Really want my wish to come true , so I can return !!!  Indigenous holy  Japanese shrine!!"
A must see! ,Such a great place to visit! All the surrounding areas are stunning too. The walk to the top isn’t the easiest but totally worth it as it’s far quieter than the very busy touristy end.
Amazing-Don't miss,"Beautiful shrine, with all the Torri gate,We enjoyed going through, it was very impressive, sorry we didn't have time to climb to the top."
A temple like no other,"It's said that this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan, and I can believe it: we were there on a cold day in December and the place was absolutely swarming. I hardly dare contemplate what it must be like in the high season.However, don't let that put you off. The temple complex covers the whole mountainside, and as you go up the mountain, the crowds fall away. The vast bulk of visitors only visit the lower part of the complex and of those who go further, most stop at the saddle where there is a great view of Kyoto, and a small restaurant. If you climb to the top (about a 15 minute walk from the saddle) and then take the loop path that leads you back  to the saddle, you can enjoy an uncrowded walk along the forest path, dotted with those iconic orange Torii gates. It's probably obvious, but it should be noted that this is NOT a destination for the mobility-impaired. The paths are steep and often narrow and there are a lot of irregular stone steps."
"10,000 Torri Gates","This shrine is one of the more famous shrines due to the number of Torri gates on the property. The shrine itself is lower on the mountain and the Torri gate pathway starts there. It is a little bit of an uphill walk with steps to get to the shrine, so keep that in mind."
Beautiful shrine and free entry,One of the most beautiful shrine in Kyoto. Entry was free but was crowded. We didn't walk too much due to the crowd.
Very cool,"Cool from a design, look, cultural and activity perspective. Takes a couple of hours at least to get the full value of the walk and views. Top site in Kyoto."
Open 24/7 - Come at night,"Due to our schedule, and a desire to avoid crowds, we came in the evening after dark which turned out to be a great choice. Got the JR line from Kyoto centre and the entrance was just over the road. At night this place no doubt has a very different feel, all lit up by lanterns. The crowds had almost vanished and just a handful of people were making the walk up and down the hill through the gates. We went to the very top (lots of steps, some effort required) and I felt it was well worth it. Heard monkeys in the forest, saw plenty of joru spiders on their webs, and met a bunch of friendly feral cats. One of my favourite places in Kyoto, available all around the clock, and best of all completely free. This is a must do!"
Worth a visit,"Saw this in the guidebook and thought that the red/orange arches were limited to one part, but no they stretch the whole way around.  It’s a long way and uphill too so you have to be fairly fit to get to the top - or very determined.  Great exercise with a good view with Japanese culture thrown in."
A future Wonder of the World,No words can describe the beaty of this site.Mind to schedule a visit for half a day and try to avoid the crowds to the maximum.  You'll enjoy this wonder even more.
Nice and free but crowded. ,It’s close proximity to the Kyoto station. Went almost towards the evening but it was still crowded. But then again it’s free so it’s worth it unlike other places in Kyoto where you pay only to find that you are just walking around the places without even getting the feel of being near it.
tori gates,"Wonderful place to visit. Allocate at least 2 hours to navigate hill and see all the gates. Take left route to avoid crowds. Much better photo opportunities on the way down. Wonderful, not to be missed."
Beautiful shrine! Must go!,We went at night. It was beautiful! I’m gutted that I can’t read Nihonggo coz there are writings on the torii gates! It was amazing walking through thousands of torii gates!
Incredible experience and view,"An absolute must whilst in Kyoto! We went in the early afternoon via train from Kyoto station. The train was quite crowded but as everyone lined up in an orderly fashion and 90% of the passengers were getting on at Kyoto station and off at Inari station, it wasn’t an issue with access. Going in the first week of the new year meant for large crowds so it often took a few minutes of waiting to get a non-crowded photo under the famous torii gates. I would highly recommend walking all the way up to the top of Mount Inari to see the spectacular view and the shrines scattered along the journey. There were many good souvenir shops and food options on the walk out as well."
Must go in Kyoto!,"Breath taking place, maps are all over the area so you know where you are, i strongly encourage you to hike all the way up, its not a hard hike, just take your time. Its very serene up there and its a nice photo place."
Amazing,"Fushimi Inari is open 24hrs...so...it's not a problem if you want to visit but you only have a time at night..just like me, i visit fushimi inari at night..hehe..not many people at night visit fushimi inari, so you can walking around fushimi inari with ease.."
Well Organize,I must say I picked the wrong time to visit it would be nicer if I visit some other time not a peak weak like New Year.The magic of the red collar still there even overwhelm by the river of people.I will come back again to have a picture as the Memoir of Geisha movie.
Just awesome,"we were there right before New Years, a huge holiday in Japan, so it was plenty busy, but it was still inspiring and well worth it"
Amazing views ,"If you go early isn't crowded and you can enjoy it more, the climb will take about 1 hour or more if you make stops"
So busy! ,"Lovely attraction, starts off very busy through the first part of gates then dissipates thank goodness"
Crowded Attraction,"After reading reviews, we arrived at the later half of the day, thinking there would be less crowd. Unfortunately, it was still very crowded. There were also large numbers of tour groups that added to the numbers.The place itself is really nice and as majestic as the photos seen. What we discovered was, the higher you go, the thinner the crowds get. Most of the visitors are at the start of the gates. They stop to take photos and such. There are many sections and the further one goes, the lesser people and plenty of photo opportunities (without having strangers in your photo)."
"10,000 gates and a climb up a mountain ","Visited on 2 January 2020 during the holiday season here and boy it was packed which in a way added to the experience.  Honestly it’s a hike up a mountain through 10,000 gates with a great view of Kyoto on the way up.  However it is very touristy now but still worth the walk.Tip: we did this with a private tour guide who parked nearby and explained the history of the site and showed us around.  Best way to do it instead of battling the crowds on the public transport"
fushimi inari,Though it is crowded the temple and the gates are amazing. It drizzled and so I didnt go uphill it became slippery and muddy. Be sure to check the weather first. Below the temple are the mini shops and food booths. I tried most of the street foods and they were all taste good
The magic of ancient Japan,"This legendary temple is way beyond what you could expect, from readings and movies. The purest air, on the top of a mountain, a 4 km walk through the ascendant path of the wooden platform built by and for ancient monks, the shrines waiting silently for your offerings (a prayer, the recollection of ancient and recent dreams,...)...It is really a place out of this world. The affluence of tourists does not disturb the solemn, yet peaceful, atmosphere."
Very nice,Very nice thing to do when you go early and later. The crowd will mess up the experience. Earlier in the morning is really nice.
Amazing place,"We brought our three kids with us, ages 12, 8, and 4. It was one of our favorite sites in all of Japan. We arrived later in the day, which I liked because there were less crowds and made for some gorgeous lighting. It was getting quite dark, though, so with kids in tow, we only spent an hour or so here. If I had to do it again, I’d plan to spend an entire half a day here (either early morning or evening) so we could have done all or most of the trail. The higher up you climb, the less crowds there are, and the more you get to see. It’s a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city and the shrines are crazy. I cannot believe how much work and money and construction went into building this! It’s truly something to see!"
Long but grounding,"We took what I’ll describe as the Robert Frost route (“two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I - I took the one less travelled by...”): that is to say we took the forest hike that diverts from the main path and meanders around, and up the back of the mountain. Along the way you’ll see stands of tall bamboo, and many smaller shines at regular intervals. There’s birds, insects, plants, and frogs along the path to keep you engaged. There’s also a woodworking workshop with a small waterfall. The road trail turns sharply and narrows up the steepest part to the summit. If you’re lucky the lady at the shrine at this point will give the kids an ice lolly! BEST! There’s no real view from the summit, but you start your descent down the path everyone else comes up (so you get to see everything they do). Enjoy the little shops on the way down (buy a unique tenugui cloth as a momento - and to mop the sweat from your brow!). And there is a gorgeous view of Kyoto 15 mins down the path. At the bottom, and to the right of the massive Torii gate, is a narrow street with food stalls for your lunch. You’re welcome!"
Something for all activity levels,"This well known shrine offered all visitors something of value.  For those who were energetic, you could walk the entire path, yet for those who were not as keen there were plenty of places to stop and admire the area or take a side-path through the gardens.  The entrance area was perfect for those who didn't want to walk too far as there were spaces for quiet reflection or simply people watching."
Many tori gates,"It’s an very interesting place to see so many tori gates being stack up. One of the most Instagram worthy place in Kyoto. Although it can be crowded, u can wait for opportunities when there are less people to snap a few shots. There are also some interesting tori gates made of bamboos and other materials."
Stunning at night,"Has to be on everyone’s list of things to do in Kyoto to be sure, but the concern is mostly about the enormous crowds that flock to this site.If you can wangle it, it is well worth visiting the Shrine after dark as the crowds are negligible and the venue is just as incredible with the lights on.  It was easy to get plenty of shots without people in the images.Great venue to visit and it is free (and huge) - make sure you have comfy shoes on if you want to walk the entire trail!"
Beautiful and easy to get to,We took two trains which puts you right out the front of the shrine. The area was beautiful and the torri gates were amazing to walk through. Very hard to get a picture as so many tourists but overall was a good experience. Perhaps maybe get there earlier in the morning (we got there around 10am)
Amazing Shinto shrine,"One of the highlights of Kyoto; an amazing experience climbing the hill through an endless series of tori gates. The shrine is centuries old, but like most Shinto sites there is very little sign of pre-war activity. However, the layout is amazing, with superb views of Kyoto from the higher areas, and a series of interesting alters scattered across the slopes."
Beautiful!,"Go early, so you won’t get into the hundred of ridiculous teens taking pictures of themselves and forgetting to actually look at the shrine."
Crowded,Really enjoyed this other than the crowds. Very hard to get a nice picture without tourist groups in the background. Car park was free which was a bonus. Entry free too! And it’s open 24 hours so my husband and dad went about 10pm and said it had an amazing atmosphere and no crowds!
Go there early to avoid the crowd.,"We went to Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shine very early in the morning as we want to avoid the crowd. It is a big shine located in Kyoto. Be prepared for a long walk to enjoy the view of the Tori gates and the scenery. Parent with baby stroller please note, there is some parts that require you to climb some long stairs."
Crowds crowds crowds ,Visited this shrine on arrival at kyoto. Beautiful shrine and immediately embraced the local feel. Crowds were huge but manageable . Would be far better to experience at another time which enabled a more spiritual feel. Lovely food stalls on the way down the street and back to the station and tried loads of interesting local delights.
Beautiful,"This is a beautiful place to visit, but you need to make sure that you go really early in the morning before the crowds arrive. If you are into photography, this is a dream spot. The hike is fairly doable, but very doable at a slow pace."
Beautiful experience ,This is one of the main shrine of the area and most popular tourist spots. The main shrine sits on a hill and there is a long pathway to reach to it. The climb up is long and is surrounded by numerous Tori gates which is beautiful.But if you are unfit or cannot afford a steep walk better turn around as quick as possible.
Long but great walk and view,"Very beautiful and peaceful. Full of torii gates that will make you company all the way to the top. There are traditional shops (for souvenirs or drinks) and restaurants where you can truly experience the Japonese way, by sitting on a cushioned pad (after removing your shoes). I tried myself and it was great after all that walk and even had a warm tea plus the traditional sweets. I'm just not that flexible to stay closed legged in a sitting position for a long time. I would advise to have comfortable shoes to make a better experience in each step and warm layered clothes if travelling on cold season.  Great Place to visit  it and would go again."
Magic walk,"It is definitely worth to walk all the way from the station to the top of the entire temple site. Of course, there are crowds of people especially in the lower parts of the site, but the more you walk to the top, the less people you will encounter, and the more you will be able to enjoy the spirit of the site."
Interesting to see & views from the top are good,"Interesting walk,  plenty to see on the way to the top. There are alot of steps, so be warned you need to wear sensible foot ware. Take some wayer too. However, there are machines to get water ay a cost. It will be busy with many tourists, as you get further up it thons out and not so busy."
Tired but worth walk.,Very tired after the walk up to the top but totally worth the time. I recommend that you go up to the top because the view is glorious!
A must see in Kyoto,"Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine is a must see place in Kyoto. It has pathways formed by thousands of torii gates. If you go to Kyoto by train, just change to JR Nara Line Local and head for Inari station (price = 150 JPY). Exit Inari station and cross a road then your are in front of Fushimi Inari-taisha. The place is crowded so it is a little hard to take photos of you and your family with the torii without distraction!"
Easily accessible and a wonderful shrine experience!,"The Fushimi Inari Taisha is extremely accessible; it is just right at the exit of the Inari station. The shrine has its characteristic path lined by many Torii gates, definitely photo-worthy!"
Well Worth the Long Walk,This place gets very crowded so it’s better to go either very early in the morning (before sunrise) or later in the afternoon when the sun is beginning to go down.
Great place to visit,"So, Kyoto is one awesome city!   And the shrine is absolutely worth the visit...crowds or no crowds!   We biked from out hotel so got there mid day so was crowded but took out time at the food vendors then started the trek through the gates...and interestingly the further you go out, the quieter and less crowded it becomes 😂😁. We enjoyed it all!  Kyoto is my favorite city in japan and tori gates are well worth a visit"
Impressive and peaceful,"When you are arriving there are multiple street food tents that tempt you into eating before going up. After walking for a bit, it is easy to take photos as most people there just for photos don’t go far. Multiple place to stop along the way to rest and feel the peacefulness of the place."
It might be busy low down but climb and it soon quietens,It might be busy low down but climb and it soon quietens - we didn't heed the arrival early warning and it was busy but not crazy. Climb to the summit and you'll have lots of photo opportunities to yourself. Had street food at the bottom after which was yummy
Don’t miss this amazing place ,"Tranquility, charm & spiritual. This is a must do!! Amazing photo opportunities. Can been busy in some parts but just be patient and you’ll get a break for the perfect shot"
Awesome place,"The gates extend all the way to the peak of the mountain and further down.  It is a pity not to be able to climb up as we joined a day tour for Kyoto.  If there is another opportunity to visit, will definitely do that."
Night visit and a lesser crowd,"Having read the past reviews on Fushimi Inari Taisha, we had decided to visit it in the evening to avoid the crowd.We took the Keihan Line train to Fushimi Inari Station and then a short walk to the main entrance. It was about 5.30pm and past sunset when we arrived. We were walking against the traffic as we saw lots of visitors heading to the train station.The beauty of a night visit is that there were just a handful of visitors and therefore no time wasted waiting for other people in order to take a perfect photo shot. The shadows of the shrine gates on the floor provided interesting angles for black and white shots.The climb up the mountain of seemingly endless rows and arcades of torii (shrine gates) had a calming effect on me. Perhaps it was the thin traffic, the night fall and cool weather. The orangey gates felt like a protecting hand over the shoulder of the visitors.The steps up the hill are well sign posted, with maps of the area at certain intervals. Do note that the lightings at some spots can be quite dim. On our way down we could see graveyards and mini shrines along the way. I’d only realised that they were graveyards much later.We exited Fushimi Inari and walked to the Inari station (JR Nara Line) for our return train journey to Kyoto Station.It was a memorable visit. We’d enjoyed the leisurely pace and the cool weather."
Exercise opportunity - many many steps up n down,"We spent 1.5 hours up and down. Reached Inari station late so was crowded at the start of the trek. Crowd start to thin as you go further up so leave the photo shoot to later part of trek.After the trek, we had a yummy tempura meal at Temupra Oe restuarant. Short walk from Fushimi Inari Taisha."
Miserable slog to nothing,"Poorly designed, little english. Too crowded. No elevators/escalators or convenience shuttle. No thought given to handicap access!"
GREAT TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ATTRACTION AS I THOUGHT MAYBE TOO HARD FOR ME AS OVER 70,Was not too hard at all and enjoyed it with our tour group but it was very crowded so went at a slow pace which suited me anyway
World famous Tori Gates ,We went to Fushimi shrine during our Kyoto trip. It was very crowded even though it was weekdays. The Thousands Tori gates are the one of the most famous icons for Kyoto. These were appeared in the Hollywood movie “ Memories of Geisha “. We only took the half trip as we have limited time but perfect enough to take pictures with famous Tori gates. Tips - it can be very crowded at the beginning of the entry of Tori gates but on the way back there are less people and you can take your perfect postcard picture without many interruptions.
Look forward to this,I look forward to seeing this every time I visit Kyoto. So wonderful and so iconic. Inspirational for many art.
Beautiful torii,"A beautiful long trail of torii, those nearer the entrance seems bigger than the ones in between the track. Walking in the direction of the torii are plain ""pillars"" of orangy red. If you turn around, you'll see inscriptions of sponsors on the other side of the torii pillars. Full of tourists, just have to move further up the trail and wait for pockets of opportunities to catch a nice photo without any photo bombs."
"Respect the Local Value, Culture and Norms","To most, this climb is for an Instagrammable moment, but for others, this is a pilgrimage, and I think the tourists should recognise the local culture. They are not rude when they want to make the climb. You are when you blocked their way just to take a picture without anyone else in your picture. This is selfish. Remember this... you are at someone else’s country, respect their local value, culture and norms... this is their sacred mountain, not yours."
Hot tourist destination ,"This certainly met my expectations, it was beautiful and we were surprised by how many gates there were.  It is busy but this does not take away from the significance of the destination"
wow! what a walk all the way,"Nice place to walk all the way, people at the shops are very friendly, one could see orange wood all the way in thousands, nice experience."
So crowded,We arrived about 0800 and there were already so many people it was difficult to get good pictures. It was the busy fall colors seasons in Kyoto. Definitely recommend going early in the morning.
Shrine Tour,"We visited the Fushimi Inari Shrine overall it was a nice experience but there are lot of other tourists however and it got a bit over crowded. Don’t get too close to some of the shrines as the caretakers don’t like it. Which is fair enough. The architecture was pretty cool and the climb to the top is a decent work out, they have yummy street vendors at the bottom which sell all kinds of local foods, a must try."
Best place to visit early morning,"This Shrine is absolutely stunning! My only and biggest advice is - GO EARLY! I went the around 7:30 am and I did not have too many people, which made my hike and time at this spectacular place even more enjoyable. Don't make a mistake even if you go later and don't try to make a nice picture with no people at the beginning of the track. There are thousands of vermilion torii gates and you definitely can get a nice shoot if you will just go deeper in the forest. Keep in mind, if you want to walk all around the track, it will take you about an hour and be ready to do some steps!"
Evening visit is well worthwhile,Less people and very atmospheric if you have some peace and can walk leisurely. Just be aware that there is the odd trip hazard so a torch would be handy in a few poorly lit areas. Other than that a place to take your time in and perhaps walk up before sunset and enjoy the different atmosphere on your return.
Kyoto tour,Spectacular and magnificent city to explore the ancient tradition of Japan from shrines through temples to food and culture of present day Japan
"Really cool to see, be ready to hike","Don't take pictures at the beginning! Everyone does and it's congested. Just hike up a bit and you can take the exact same picture. People and organizations pay money to have gates constructed here for good luck. Some look old but I think most aren't that old because they end up being turned over. The colors are really vibrant. The hike up at certain points get strenuous. However there is a nice view of the city. At the top portions there are some shrines. However they are not particularly impressive. If you get tired, you're not missing much by not going all the way to the top."
Night views of the shrine,"Second time to the shrine. The first time didn't leave a good impression on me as the whole place was crowded with tourists and I could barely move among the crowds, and the photos didn't turn out great. This time, when I reached there, it was coming to six in the evening. The stalls lining in front of the shrine have packed and started to move off. It was surprisingly beautiful to see it in the night time. However, didn't manage to complete the climb up the torii gates as hardly saw anyone going up or coming down. The place is easily accessible by stopping at JR Nara station or Keihan Fushimi Inari with the latter passing by the rows of souvenir shops and stalls."
Great exercise!,"It is a lot of walking, but worth it. It wasn't too busy when we arrived mid morning but got pretty crowded after lunch. The street food on the way in and out was great."
3 hour Mt Inari loop,"I found out about this attraction in Vlogs and Vloggers often show just the first part where you enter the first Torii  that leads to numerous more. What I found is that there is more to it and if you have a bit of time take the Mt Inari challenge and reach the summit. As soon as I get to path no 6 (I thought I have reached the top!) and realised it is only the base of the actual loop. I was already tired at this stage and the steps leading to path 6 was ardous. I nearly gave up but my daughter pushed me to get to the top and off we go. Between each rest stop are unique shrines, there’s even a lake at the top of the mountain. The challenge was at a certain point you will no longer have access to a rest room yet , I need to drink to replenish my thirst. So either you get to the top quickly or I had to just take little sips of water 😂. I am not fit and my knees were feeling it but I still managed to reach the summit in 2 and a half hours. Going down and back to the entrance was of course a breeze but it still took me a good half hour. Lots of mini shrines and hidden gems in little pockets so have fun!"
Good cardio work out!,"Visited the Inari-taisha Shrine on a sunny day, only a few stops from Kyoto station. was very busy though, I went in the morning around 9am. As I was leaving about 11.30am, place was packed, so go early! Can be hard work but well worth it, take some drinks with you, although you can buy food and drinks on the way round, I found it was getting busy. a geart 3 hours and, would recommend you visit."
Good to tick off the list,"One of those sights which you’d have to do to tick off the ‘have visited Kyoto” list.  Experience was underwhelming - certainly looks better in the photos whereas the reality is it seems a lot more jaded.  Lots of people around, which probably makes it more difficult to appreciate as you are just trying to avoid people walking in front and behind.  As you go further up, the crowd thins and that’s the positive."
Checked off Kyoto’s must-see places,Got there in the afternoon. It was awfully crowded. Did not walk through the whole route as there is no time indication at various split points and was not sure if we had enough time. Street food around the temple was interesting though many are overpriced.
Get lost and loose the crowds,"We got lost around the back of the mountain - we also lost the crowds! It was magical. Loosing the crowds was by far the best way to appriciate the beauty of the place, especially walking through the gates with autumn leaves falling. We too the path to the right. As the crowds thinned out, we walked through a bamboo forest. We passed lots of little shrines along the way. While we stopped at a vending machine, we found a clowder of cats. The track got steeper and steeper - it definitely took more than 30 minutes with kids. Looking down the gully, there was a breathtaking view. Reaching the top, there is a larger shrine. Travelling back down, we found the crowds again. We came across little shops, where the kids enjoyed icecream while resting and watching an amazing view."
Good Easy HIke,"As most reviewer stated, if you want to avoid crowd you have to be there really early. On our first try, we got there around 08:30 am and the place is already very crowded so instead of walking up we decided to just walk around the area surrounding fushimi and tried some of the street foods.We came back two days later and arrived just after 07:00 am where there are fewer people where we are able to walk up to the top at a slow pace without holding up other people behind us and stopping to take photos."
Stunning,I went on a Wednesday and it was still very busy. The tori gates were stunning as were the bamboo Forrest that surrounds the mountain.
"A good, slightly crowded, experience","One of Kyoto's three unmissable experiences. Although fairly crowded, mainly with Japanese visitors, this did not really detract from the pleasure of the site. My overall impression was of a fun but respectful shrine. The main element is of course the long series of red arches. The good natured crowds were clearly enjoying the visit - added to by the number of food stalls."
Highlight of Kyoto Visit,"Visiting Fushimi Inari Shrine, you are transported in time to a magical place.  Walking through the red gates, climbing up the hills, is a beautiful experience.  Wear comfortable shoes!"
Go Early; So beautiful,Well I thought since it was November there weren't going to be that many tourists but....I was wrong.  You really have to go very early to avoid the crowds but even though it was really busy there are still breaks in the crowd for good pictures. Hike the whole thing and take in the beautiful sights.
So many Tori Gates,This is certainly the place to see the best Tori gates. You can get some great pictures as long as you are quick to avoid the people in view. Try taking an alternative route at certain places to achieve this. It is very much worth visiting to see the amount of colour set in  this area with the writing on the sides... must have taken them years to build these shrines.
Go early to avoid the huge crowd,impossible to take nice photos unless u head further up the hill as the crowd thins when going further upwards. there is graveyard. head there with a friend if you are worry.
Nice walk up,We went around 2pm and the place was packed with locals and tourists. Its quite a long walk up but there are exits along the way. On the way down there are many street food.
2 Hour Hike ,"This massive shrine has been around for more than 10 centuries!  Numerous, massive orange gates along most of the trail, which takes about 2 hours if you want to do it all."
Great place to visit with family,Very nice place for a visit & walk up the mountain. Lots of scenic photo opportunities and chance to learn about the local culture. We went with a pair of  University student volunteer guides from the Kyoto Good Samaritan Club. They were highly knowledgeable about the history of the temple.
Completed!,A bucket list item for me! Managed to complete and went all the way up this time round. The start of the climb was extremely crowded. Persevere and hike up and the crowd will not be as bad. Enjoyed it again! There are food stalls around.
Serene,"We took the very first train at 5am to beat the crowds at Fushimi Inari. We got there when it was still dark and I think it’s the best way to do it. I climbed all the way up to the summit and the higher you climb, the less crowded it gets. The tori gates go all the way to top so it’s pretty amazing. It is definitely a lot of walking and climbing so wear comfy shoes and bring water. There are some washrooms and and vending machines along the way. There’s also a lot of signs warning against monkeys and boars but I didn’t see any animals, save for a couple of cats.  The view of Kyoto near the top is beautiful. I got down from the mountain at around 8am and by this time, the crowds have arrived. This is a free attraction and well worth a visit."
Kyoto visit in fall,"Our family was here in Nov 2018. We went to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. Out of all three cities, Kyoto was my favorite and out of all temples and shrines, this was my favorite one. I agree with other reviewers, the place is ridiculously crowded but that’s something we had to deal with everywhere in Kyoto, not just this temple. It’s even worse in Tokyo. Nevertheless we were quite surprised y the number of people and were quite hungry by the time we got there. There’s a street going up to the shrine where there are a lot of food street vendors, we were so hungry that we ended up grabbing some chicken and ate there. It was so crowded that I had to look for an open spot on the sidewalk to sit down and eat (we’re a family of four). That being said, the shrine is stunning, the further you go up, the less people you will see. If you like to hike in general, you will love this place even more because you can go to the top of the mountain. We were there at lunch time and by the time we ate, we didn’t have enough time (or water) to go all the way to the top, we only made it half way thru....that’s my only regret, I wish I had done more research before we went and had known that the gates go up a mountain so we would’ve been better prepared. I loved Kyoto and Nara and hope to go back some day, this shrine is at the top of my list to see again.Kyoto, like a lot of areas in Japan is very crowded but very beautiful, you need to make it past the shock of how crowded it is and just enjoy its beauty and history."
Long walk but beautiful shrine,Husband and I are not buddhists so we came her just to have a look. We came on a Saturday mid morning and it was quite crowded. To go all the way up and down will take an hour or so. Quite many steps so for those with difficulty in walking may find a challenge to walk up.
Wow!,Such an amazing place to visit. Start of December was a bit quieter but still busy so would recommend going before 8am if you can. Look out to the sides of the main tracks as some more gates without the crowds worth a look!
"Avoid the crowds, go early! ","This is not my first trip to Fushimi Inari so this time we made sure to wake up very early to beat the crowds and do the long climb to the top!It's very exhausting, I don't recommend it if you have any joint pain or issues with walking.Many reviews here say its very busy and that's true for the most part. It's far less busy if you get there early in the morning and if you climb higher up."
Nice views by night,"We have visited the place by late Nov. and happened to see the night scenes there. Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine was built to honor Inari, the Shinto God of rice.  Apart from that at the entrance and nearby structures, visitors could walk uphill and view many other sub-shrines on the way.  Special experience by night time upon illumination."
Keep walking!,It's about 10000 steps up and down (if my iPhone app was right). But it's worth every step and huffs and puffs along the way. I climbed early in the morning to avoid the crowd and late at night to seek quietude.
Arches galore,One of the busy shrines in Kyoto. Was part of our day trip on Kyoto Bike tour. Having a guide to explain the background of the many thousands of 'gates' was interesting. There are tens of thousands some you can walk through others just to hang up. Its commercial atmosphere does slightly detract from the principle of why it stands. Walk up the path and you do get a more peaceful atmosphere.
Unique,"This temple was very nice and unique. If you decide to do the whole loop, it may take you over 2 hours because there are lots of steps to go up. The orange torii is great to take pictures but it’s always crowded! The food they sell prior to entering is amazing too."
"Very busy, but well worth the effort","I'm glad I visited but I really wish I had come very early in the morning to avoid the heaving crowds. It's almost impossible to get a photo without thousands of people in it.You can walk all the way up the mountain or only do the lower part and then return another way to the base, as the traffic mostly flows up not down."
Overwhelming,"Couldn't get over the sheer amount of Torii gates at this shrine, believe it or not there seemed to be more gates than tourists which is hard to comprehend. The climb was spoiled by regular showers and low cloud which spoiled the views over Kyoto. Easily reached by public transport so you can dictate how long you wish to spend there."
Fabulous,Get there early...the shrine opens nice and early so take advantage. Once you get to 9am or after it gets busy. Ideally you want to walk through this astonishing shrine with as few people as possible. It is one of the most unique and stunning shrines.
Go to the top,"Whilst the start if this shrine is absolutely packed with tourists all trying to get a selfie with the first orange gste they see, if you manage to make your way past the crowd you start to climb Mt Inari and see some beautiful sights. It take maybe 3 hours in total to go up and 3again, but it's worth it as at the top you get some awesome views of Kyoto, and some peaceful places to enjoy the shrines on your own...and maybe get a selfie with them."
Our Visit at Night,"We arrived at Inari Station in the late afternoon, headed to our nearby rental house on q quiet street nearby.  We had researched exploring and experiencing Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine would be a highlight for us.  It had been shared with us to go early or late afternoon or evening as the shrine is open 24 hours a day.  We walked a few blocks to enter the shrine and found only a handful of locals at the shrine.  What a wonderful experience for our small group, to explore and just hang out for hours to soak in the cultural and emotional experiences of being at the Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine.  We were able to wander up through the temples and then up the path of all the Tori Gates taking photos and making videos without any other people.  We highly recommend this shrine and to go early or in the evening."
Get There Early!,"This is a big tourist destination, so my wife and I got up early.  We arrived there about 7:30am and there were already about 100 people at the base of the walk.  However, we ended up having almost the entirety of the walk up to the top by ourselves, which was amazing.  On the way down there were many more people."
An awesome experience!,"Don't be afraid by the crowd when crossing the first torris, it gets way better after passing the first shrine.IMO the 45 mins of climbing to the summit aren't worth it... There is a small shrine at the top but no view.The best point of view is the one close to the big stopping area that has a tea house and a restaurant. When you reach this area, there are some stairs on the left that are leading to a nice spot with less crowd."
Battle of the crowds ,From the train to the exiting of the station to walking through the shrine it was shoulder to shoulder walking at a set pace. It would be lovely to see with only a few thousand people but it was so very crowded thou just had tho move with the crowd.  For the energetic fit  and with more time to trek to the top of the mountain you would then escape a lot of the crowds and it may be more beautiful.  We found asmall place tho still and sit on the way back down  and you could buy an ice cream and view a lovely pond.  We c did not see anywhere to buy snacks or coffee but apparently there was alittle side laneway  with stalls which we missed  2.7 million people visit on new years day alone so avoid that day at all costs.
Get there early and have an amazing workout hiking through the torii gates!!,Leave Kyoto early in the morning to have the mountain to yourself and other early birds! It is marvelous and quite a workout with a zen-like peacefulness. Do take the right side up the hill; the number of continuous steps is less than on the left side route. It took 90-120 minutes to complete the circuit; my Fitbit (that apparently only counts up steps) said 81 floors.
Nice place to have short hike,"Came to Fushimi Inari in the morning. Around 8am and it's less crowded. Glad we came early, since the time we walk down from the peak people already gathered in main entrance. And almost impossible to take pictures with clear view without people passing by."
My Favorite Active Temple Visit in Kyoto - The Early Bird Gets the Worm,"This is by far one of the most famous visits in Kyoto. However, with that said, the crowds will be at Fushimi Inari. I would highly suggest setting your alarm very early at getting there by 8am. You can go up to the highest point for a view of Kyoto before the majority of visitors. If you don't want to take the same way down, I would suggest taking a detour down the fire road to another sight, Tofuku-ji Temple."
Very crowded,"The crowds thin out as the shrine winds its way up the hill. If you're looking (as I was) for the bit with two bits of the shrine corridor side by side. That is at the very beginning! So there's no need to toil on up the hill. That said, if you press on you get the bits of the shrine with Japanese characters on the sides."
"Peaceful in the morning, food after that!","Took the 8am from Kyoto station and two stops later we were there. Very few people at that time which made it easy to see the shrine and then walk up. Agree with the other reviewers ... the higher up, less people. By the time you get down all the food stalls to the right are open and you can feast on many offerings."
Go there early!!,"Came here on a weekday a little after 7am (they are actually open 24 hours, but not sure how photography is after dark), sunrise was about 6:45am, so perfect timing.Practically got the whole place to ourselves and few die hard fans and early birders.  You can take all the photos you want and lots of elbow rooms everywhere.Got all the way to the top in less than an hour with leisure climb and lots of Kodak moment stops.  Beautiful late November, weather was perfect.  Blue sky white cloud as it got passed 8 am.  Under 10 Celsius, no sweat at all.That's my recommendation pretty much on all major tourist spots here in Kyoto.  And you will justly get rewarded for being early."
Fun in the dark,"We came after dark but I thought it was beautiful. Enjoyed walking around visiting the shrine. Quiet, peaceful."
Crowded but fun!,"Autumn is a crowded time of year to visit, but we had a great time, and the higher you climb, the more the crowds thin out.  Walking through the torii is unforgettable."
Great place but crowded,"November foliage, history, culture and great tour guide made this trip memorable.  Very crowded however, all worthwhile"
Obligatory when in Kyoto ,"Of course this is a must do in Kyoto. My advice would be to read as much about the history behind it beforehand, as there's not much info given on site. Its a long walk  to the top, and there's just a shrine (no view from the top! The only view is a view over Kyoto, somewhere halfway). We had a nice time."
Worth a visit,"Crowded with tourists. Climbed to the top of Mt Inari, which is a hour climb. As you climb higher, there will be less tourist and could get some good photos"
Crowed but Must See Shrine,"I was told before our trip that this was a ""must-see"" shrine. When we arrived, I was a little nervous because of the crowds. But this was the most memorable stop in Kyoto. The faomus trail of the Tori Gates is so much longer than you realize. At almost 75, my wife and I had a pretty good workout following the trail, which seemed to be uphill the entire way. Despite the crowds, the length of the trail will provide those moments when you can feel alone. By all means don't miss this important cultural shrine in Kyoto."
A must see in Japan,"Amazing!You have to be at the opening to avoid the crowd. Waking up early in the morning is the best. Because walking with nobody is the most relaxing thing you could do. Take some water in order to avoid overprice bottle.It's a good walk, but nothing's difficult. Just go early in the morning and enjoy!"
Go early and go to the top,"Once you climb high enough to lose the crowds, it's incredibly calm. A beautiful spot and Kyoto highlight."
combination of beauty and fun,"It is striking beautiful to look at it and it is also a real fun to walk inside. The orange colors, the writing and the green surrounding  makes it a very pleasant place to visit."
Super crowded but cool,"This is a great place for great pics. Unfortunately, it is super crowded because everyone is trying to take a selfie. I would go super early to avoid crowds."
Sightseing,My daughter took me here and it was an enjoyable trip for me it was so crowded with tourists but we have no choice but to just go with the crowd anyways i was able to take some photos as souvenir of our trip. i think you better go there early right afer it opens or late in the afternoon before it closes...have fun.
Climb to top,"The trek up to peak was doable and interesting with shrines, statues, red tori gates, snack shops, fountains, and most important, less crowd and more doable photo shoots with less photobomb."
Love the Tori Gates of Kyoto,"They’re an iconic picture of not just Kyoto but also Japan.  For me the place lived up to expectation and made for a nice walk / exercise up the hill and gatesThere must be around 1,000 gates and can give some amazing photosHowever it does get busy so worth while getting there before 8am to beat the crowds"
Steep climb,The main attraction to me would be the city view from the lookout area mid way up. There is no view at all at the summit so don't waste your energy and time climbing all the way up.
