Nice place to visit,"must see it, if you are in lukhnow, greate Art of workmanship. go in Evening or early morning only.."
Ambedkar park :the best place to enjoy,I visited there quite a few months ago and in winters and i have to say in this context that me and my friends enjoyed a lot there and we took photographs there which were so awesome
Amazing how this has been built,This is a great few hours out and about.  The architecture is incredible.  The whole park is made of marbel and you see dragonflies trying to lay eggs on it.  Not the best for evolution but there are bloody hundreds of them so can't be doing too bad for them.
Ambedkar Memorial Park,Ambedkar Memorial Park is a fantastic place to hangout and enjoy with dear ones. One should definately visit this place.
Concrete jungle ,Too much of concrete is eye soaring. Came to know from the cab driver that the area had lush green forests before this park was constructed.
Park,"Now Ambedkar Memorial Park, formally known as Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal, is a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar. The memorial is dedicated to B. R. Ambedkar ""father of the Indian Constitution""."
Simply Awesome,"The Ambedkar park has entry fees worth it. I went with my friends in this park and really amazed with the architectural beauty of the park. Must one time visit , if you are in lucknow. I see many people enjoy by admiring the park beauty and click awesome photographs."
Amazing place,I visited here with my family . Loved this place will like to visit here again. Don't visit during summers as monuments here are made of marble or stones . Enjoyed a lot here .
Picnic,It was great going out after long really had great time with family and friends. Monument is completely made of marbal and stone must be hot during summers but overall liked the place
Very nice,This part is very nice main is very nice I am go to with boyfriend enjoy this is very beautiful place
Best trip but chosen in wrong season!,"Hi there, this is Rajat.Firstly let me tell why I wrote title like this.Friends I went to the trip on the month of June and the place was fully made up of marble and stone and just imagine sitting on a marble in June month.But this turns into a happy trip at evening... there are lots of statues (max elephant) and very precious structure...I suggest you not to visit in Summer but prefer to visit in normal days.There is nothing like Tree in the park... I have seen the only park with no trees that was a minus to it.Although visit just once and enjoy the beautiful architecture.Thanks for reading"
Beautiful Park,"We were amazed with the beauty of this park, except smell of Gomti river water. Lukhnow development authority should consider daily light and show program which should help to bring tourists."
Time pass in Park,"As we had to pass time for an hour so we decided to visit Ambedkar Park ,having fountain but it works only in the evening from 6pm to 9pm.We had a good time to njoy green part of park.very well maintained."
Huge park dedicated to Ambedkar and elephants…,The park is very huge with open wide spaces in all directions. There are several elephant statues and huge statues of Dr. Ambedkar along with other political leaders. The view from the top is good and the park is well maintained.
"My Visit to Ambedkar Memorial Park, Lucknow","Lucknow has a rich cultural heritage with many historic monuments, gardens and famous parks. Everywhere one can see greenery with shady trees and spacious parks. nearly there are one hundred parks such as Gautam Buddha park, Dr.Ram Manohar Lohia Park, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Swarna Jayanti Smriti Vihar Park, Chandrasekhar Azad Park etc.  The Nawabs of Awadh beautified this city with many gardens, palaces and mosques. During my short stay there I had an opportunity of visiting the Ambedkar Memorial Park, a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar. Ms. Mayavati, the former Chief Minister and leader of B.S.P. established this park with many monuments and pillars to represent the democratic ideals of social reformers and noble persons who worked for the upliftment of Dalit people. The foundation stone for this memorial park was laid in 1995. It was called Dr.Bhimrao Udyan. Construction and development work continued up to 2002 and the park was re-named as Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. In 2007 it was further renovated and developed. On April 14, 2008 the park was opened to the public. Finally in 2012 the park was re-named as Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. Red sandstone from Rajasthan was used for this megalithic construction. Nearly seven billion rupees were spent to build this lofty monument which has become the pride and glorious symbol of this city. Unlike other parks, here one does not find much greenery and gigantic trees. So we don’t find any shelter if it suddenly rains. It would be better if the authorities have set up some shelters for visitors to protect themselves from intense heat of summer and rainy showers. You will see a very spacious land of 107 acres with a broad stretch of road flanked by sixty-two stone elephants on either side at the main entrance. This spot is called “Pratibimb Sthal”. Priority is given to statues of elephants as the elephant is the election symbol of Mayavati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and also of  Ambedkar’s Republican Party. Nearly three thousand elephant figures are seen in this grand construction.  In the center of the park there is a massive musical fountain. It stands as a symbol of Dalit empowerment and dignity. On the left side of the park one can see a huge building called Ambedkar Sthupa located on a mound. Inside the Sthupa one can see a big bronze statue of Ambedkar seated in a chair. At the base of the statue a message in Hindi is engraved which means “My struggle of life is my only message.” Many statues are seen depicting the life of Ambedkar. In Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sangrahalay spread over 2.5 acres, one can see a monument with two domes. Under one building one can see the statues of eminent social reformers like Jyothi Rao Phule, Shri Narayana Guru, Dr.Ambedkar, Kanshi Ramji and Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj . In the second building the marble statues of Gautam Buddha, Sant Kabir Das, Sant Ravi Das, Guru Ghasi Das and Sri Birsa Munda are seen. This monument is an objective representation of equality, humanity and social justice. In Drashya Sthal one can see an eighty- foot tall pyramid structure with water flowing from its top. From here one can have a panoramic view of the whole park with its monuments and pillars spread around. In Dr.Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Gallery spread over four acres one can see many bronze murals. It would better serve the purpose of spreading the ideals and message of Ambedkar and other leaders if a gift shop is set up there where one can buy books, photos and souvenirs that contain the teachings and messages of these noble personalities. This park is open from 11.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on all days except on Monday. This park was under the supervision of the Lucknow Development Authority."
Excellent place,"It's great place to see, to roam to enjoy with friends and see the beauty of Lucknow...This things are like assets for the UP."
Great place to visit,"We visited this outstanding one-of-a-kind park honoring writer of the Indian constitution. Great walking venue. The elephants are magnificent. We were there just at dark. It is beautiful in the day, but the night time is really delightful."
Oh really massive park and monument,"Massive park with marble floor, had herad of controversial statements on this, could have been left more natural, on both sides of Gomti anyway good open space in Lucknow!"
Lucknow's pride,"This place should be your in list whenever you visit Lucknow.Beautiful place with some information and great place to click pictures or for Photoshoot. Many movies shooting were done here. This place is the pride of Lucknow. So whenever you plan to visit lucknow, dont forget to visit this place"
Voyage alone,Admission fee is just 15 rupees. It was worth it. I have never come to this low cost park entrance fee. I like building work It indicates commitment and a heart that believes in this.Is a wesome place.I love this place so much
Vizit,"Awesome place for enjoyment. So many and so clean and beautiful statue of elephant. Unique architecture with so many interesting facts. facilities are good like lock rooms ,washrooms,drinking water, security. Many reason to visit with family.I would like to recommend all of you to visit at least one time.Ticket price is just 20"
Open area,"It looks good in the night with lighting. Lot of area is there, park to roam with kids. Not very well maintained, nothing special there though but still famous due to political reasons may be."
Lovely ,"This is one of the must do places in Lucknow. Rather recent but built keeping in mind the traditional architecture of the city. On 1 side of Gomti river, this place a huge, well maintained. Dr Ambedkar is a celebrated leader. He is called the father of the Indian constitution. He has many followers even today. And this park is a tribute to him."
Picnic,This is Good Park to relax for all ages peoples also for good for little child who can play there with fun.
Unique but should have been better,"It's uniquely designed on a very grand scale. It's probably unmatched in size & design. But lots of design flaws leaves this park a potential unutilized. As far as this fact I'd concerned, lots of public money seems wasted. 9 large statues of mayavati is the lowest point in making of this park. Don't ever think of visiting this park on a summer noon. I was as much disappointed as i appreciate its grand scale design."
Good time,I always want to visit the place which has a beauty of art in architecture and love in side but the place is become hot at the time in mid day best visit the evening time after 6 pm must visit
money wasting,just wasting money you can imagine only elephant last visit janeshwar i think may be some attractive but really disappointed
Waste waste waste,"This place is proof how people's money is wasted by the politicians. This place is full of king size statue of politicians with no greenery, billions are wasted to make this so called park."
Must see once with friends or family,New concept park. Well organized and maintained one. Only problem is the political inclination. Rest is OK.  One must see particularly in the evening if you are in Lucknow.
A NEW LANDMARK FOR LUCKNOW,Innovative concept to introduce large open spaces. Nice place to hang around in the evenings or cloudy weather? Never visit the place during Summer ?? The best example of Political Marvels - construct during your Party is in power and pass on the responsibilities of maintenance to the next ??
Properly Maintained ,"Good Place, Nicely maintained. But during summer it should be looked. Need to have alternative on the same. An awareness programme has to be spread in terms of afforestation and utilisation of plastic products."
grandure defined! ,This place is extraordinary and big in size with multiple places to see and chill at! It's a grand size park and also features around 62 large size elephants in a line near Mr Ambedkar's statue and it's a must visit place in Lucknow. Try going in the evening and enjoy the sunset with these pretty structures in the area!
Place for an evening visit,It's a nice place to visit with the family in the evenings. It would have had been better if there was more lightening during nights
Nothing special ,A big marble construct and not a park at all. Lots of fountains that clearly don't work. Do not go out of your way to visit. Very disappointing.
"Shah Jahan Built Taj Mahal, Mayawati built Ambedkar Park",Be prepared to be struck by the sheer size and expanse of this magnificent modern structure. A must visit if you happen to be in Lucknow.
Monument,Just a monuments for photos... Statue and park... Better time to go after 6pm... Because its hot...Day time go only for photos since there is no shade...
A good visit,I went for a walk with my friend and saw that there is so many amazing building which can't define. enjoying alot my friend also talking about this
AVERAGE,This is historical place. One of the famous park in lucknow. Every one must visit here for some experience.
A must see,"Created by Mayawati when she was the CM , this definitely is not to be missed for its grand scale & opulence . It's built over a very very large area & one needs at least two hours to go around if one wants to see it properly. A photographer's delight , one must carry a good camera or mobile to capture the moments."
Dr Ambedkar Park  Mayawati tried to make a second Taj Mahal,"Its a very good place to visit during evening and night. During Mayawati period of CM it was highly maintained and cleanliness was very good. But now its care is very poor. still buildings in the park, are representation of Dr Ambedkar and other dalit social activists"
nice and creative place,if you are visting lucknow dont miss to visit ambedkar park . it is near 1090 women poerment chauraha in gomti nagar opposite to taj hotel and wonderful work of marbel you will observe here..
Good Place ,I had visited this place last month. And found very much memorable to see at Lucknow. Please go once and see.
Park review,Good place to visit at lucknow. In between 1090 chauraha and gomti nagar. Neat and clean park. Tickets are available
Park review,Neet and clean park in between gomtinagar and 1090 chawraha. Its a big park and nice place to visit in the evening
Beautiful Park at Gomti Nagar,"Well planed park for morning walk. Provision for drinking water should be there for the visitors. The temporary Road side stalls for quick bite should be restricted, otherwise they will cover the entire park in due course of time.."
Ambedkar Park Lucknow.,Very impressive monument.Vastness and cleanliness was most attractive.Statues were most impressive.Many young people are visiting this place and getting inspiration.
Leisurely stroll into the Indian constitution architect ,The sprawling area is a wowThe statues and structures are magnificent The greatness of a man who wrote the Indian constitution is well respected and portrayed The whole park is a leisurely stroll Wish there were more English descriptions and some maps to show the directions
good visit,the park is looking so awesome in really there is no such think to visit you can only go the park for photo shot and for time spend with your love ones
Recent build monument to Visit,Its one of the recent build monument to visit. If you are on visit of lucknow then you can visit this place.
Grand,"One of the most beautiful memorials/parks in India, if you don't mind the self-promotion in many places."
Nice Picnic Spot,Superb layout with ample of parking space. The place is full with morning and evening walkers. Evening a good place for Youngsters.
Very Big Park but must visit.,"Very nicely maintained and huge statues of Mayavati Ji, Kanshiramji and Babasaheb Ambedkar. Must visit park, if you are in Lucknow."
bhim park,the park is located to next of gomti river front and a very famous park in lucknow . the park is spread in massive area and in evenings the park is lit with different lights which adds more beauty to the park . the park is dedicated to dr bhim rao ambedkar
very nice and peaceful place,"constructed in the memories of Dr. Ambedker by Shri Mayawati  her political symbol Elephant is present everywhere, beautifull modern architure.. prefferred to visit hour before sunset so one can see both day and night beauty"
THE PARK,"The Amedkar park is a park in a very large area.In this park statue of Ambedkar, Lord budhha etc are established.Park is well mentained."
Good place to hang out,"Well this place is nicely located, and is massive in area covered. I had gone on week day here and found , number of elephants made of stones were much more then tourists."
Like being in ancient Egypt or Persia,This park will take your breath away!  It is indescribable in its beauty and magnificence.  We spent hours there just in awe of such a unique place.  There is nowhere in the world to compare it to that we know of.  Do not miss this under any circumstances
Awesome place,"The lighting, the architecture and the entire atmosphere is amazing. I absolutely loved it. I think I roamed around the place for couple of hours just enjoying the view and peacefulness of the place."
Heritage place ,Its made for BABA SAHAB DR.BHIM RAO AMBEDKER.Nice place to visit there with family and friends  best time to go there winter and evening but summer is not great time to visit there just because of heat and open area. Marble floor is very hot. If you're planning to come here then give atleast 4 hour's for get experience about Ambedker park.
A gargantuan egotrip,"The monument is built over many acres. On the plus side, it is beautifully landscaped. There are stupas and there are gardens. The elephants erected in scores gives it a pharoic appearance. There are statues erected of a living person, while the doyens of social transformation are humbly scattered to the periphery. The surrounds are cool and serene. The nighttime lighting is also excellent."
Grandiose!,"Visited during the evening, and was impressed by the large structures and lighting around the memorial.  Everything is grandiose.  The main statue in the interior is modeled on the Lincoln Memorial."
Ugly as in what!!!,"someone built this trying to leave a legacy, but its become a monstrosity. only Granite and only self-proclamation statues that even legendary kings of lore and craziness have not done"
Excellent place,Very nice place... Many people are came here and enjoy... Best place for Girlfriend & Boyfriend... Also it's a lover point.Here you can come with your full family. 😍😍🇮🇳 If you are a 📷photographer then this is a good place for photography.    Ticket till now days only 15 Rs./person. Good place.👏  👏
Picnic,Nice park for picnic with family and children also .Nice area for playing games with children for football and cricket with little kids for enjoyment and also good water fall in the centre of the park .Most beautiful thing that most of tree are green and diffrent types in this park.
Expansive ,Well maintained premises. Full of statues of elephants.  Even the column is topped with elephants.  Two large buildings having a an Ambedkar gallery and museum.Handicap friendly but should have wheel chairs for the elderly. Needs more waste bins.Toilets unclean and poorly maintained.No English toilet for senior citizens. No separate urinals.
Great place to visit with family and friends.,It is a great place to spend weakend with family. It's clean and comfortable place for tourists. Hope to visit again.
Should have more greenery.,Looks like granite and concrete maidan. There should be more trees and the pathway should have been lawn
Breathtaking monument,"we went there with our driver and paid the entrance fee and went inside and took many photos. There were few people there but as went there early, maybe! It is a beautiful place."
Elephants,it is constructed at the river banks of Gomti. Nice to see 30 elephants each on two sides in a row. vast area with no shelter. you need to walk. not even water is available inside. you can see even all 70 pillars have elephants on the top. you see elephants of all sizez at each and every place.
Its a good place to visit in the heart of city,Its a place with good architecture. It is easy to commute and located near Gomti river giving a pleasant evening experience.
Vast!,"It is certainly worth visiting the Dr Ambedkar Park, but in the heat, with the sun reflecting off the marble (or whatever shiny stone was on the ground) it made for quite an exhausting outing.  However, it was very enjoyable although we didn't see it all due to the amount of steps up to many of the structures."
Huge and beautiful ,"Everything is neat and clean in this huge establishment. Very open and beautiful. Only drawback is the floors have different levels which might be accidental .When visitors are walking through the floor,they must watch their steps especially in the evening."
Ok,"Visit in the day time ,you won't see much crowd there and would wonder why you are wandering in the park. If you have tight schedule, you can skip this or just visit statues in the park."
waste of money / bad for the environment,"Such a colossal waste of money, very hot - adds to the heat in the environment bcoz of the pink stones used. couldn't the money to improve the public services and infrastructure, specially public health in the city"
What a place ambedkar smarak,"Mesmerizing,spead in huge area almost 5sq km, many full size elephant of stone looks wow, I think this is now address of Lucknow."
park hi park,"This is really a good park if you like to jog in the morning because of the greenery and open space in the park. The best things is the park is never too much crowded ,and you can relax here"
Huge and Expansive,"We visited the park because it was very much talked about and it was very close to Taj.The place is very well maintained but poorly illuminated for the evening strolls. Trees and greenery is lacking, an overdose of concrete and stone. It would be very hot in the daytime, so evening is the best time to visit."
Good monument,Very beautiful Park made in leadership of mayawati Best place to visit. Very good quality work and of dalit leaders. Very neat clean park. Stone sculptures Very good quality. It is permitted entry in daylight only . .
Good place,"Dr Ambedkar park, our first visit to here, after reaching the city , we all like the place only problem is too hot we reached time, but superb and enjoyable"
"Great Gift to people of Lucknow, India & world","It glorify the mind & people visit, ticket for visit is very cheap, great park, lots of new technology adopted for construction, very good place to visit and spend evening during visit to Lucknow. Presently maintenance is not up to date, needs more vigilance for keeping park intact with all lights, cleanliness and repair."
Pride place for depressed class,"There are crores of temples in India where public is looted in the name of chadawa/ dan. But this is a temple of those real gods, sho have fought for equality in society, as such all the so called upper caste people indicate it as waste tax payers money. Modi had wasted more than 100times of that in their luxury life and foreign visits, but no one called the waste of tax payers money. Why? No one had pointed that gold in golden temple is waste of money, khajana of all temples are public property and should be used by government. But only ambedkar park, why?"
Excellent...,Must visit place of Lucknow... Great piece of architect.. Go and visit at least one time if you are in Lucknow.
Monstrocity,It was a monstrocity. In a park you expect to see grass or greenery. Here you see acres of tiled space.
Memorial for the greatest humanist!,"Remembering Dr Ambedkar is a must for all those who believe in human equality and I visited this memorial after sunset, while going to the airport.  I wish if I could have had more time to spend here."
A good example to see how to waste tax payers money,This is one of the place which is a good example to see how any government can waste tax payers money. This is sheer concrete architecture and a mere waste of money. Very disappointed. Lot of land has been used without any purpose.
Phenomenal Waste of Tax Payers Money,"The Ambedkar Park is concrete park, decorated with stones & sculptures. It is quite beautiful & artistic but extremely hot & uncomfortable, particularly in noon. It was widely criticized for the amount of funds spent by the government on construction & subsequent reconstructions. The park is one of the most famous & well built parks in India and though there is some rush at the ticket counter, the vast size ensures enough space to crowd inside.The best time to visit is evening & rain, but remember to bring your umbrella/raincoat as the park offers little shelter.Overall a good place to go on weekdays."
What a waste of the indian peoples money,"This monument in the centre of Lucknow is a concrete eyesore. At a cost in the multi millions the monument is hot, unattractive and offers little in the way of comfort or shelter for the locals or tourists. To give a little explanation there are 64 concrete elephants each one cost 1 million rupees. This monument was commission by 1 politician at the expense of the Indian people"
Must see park at Lucknow.,"Made by lots of white and red stones,marbles..Situated at the centre of the Lucknow city.Spread area , lots of green."
Must see place in Lucknow,"Located in Gomtinagar, central Lucknow. It is spread over 107 acres. It’s a great monument to remember the master who created the Indian Constitution. It is mesmerisingly neat and shining."
lots of elephant,bhut he aacha park hai gomti nagar mai hai or elephant to bhut hai par natural nhe hai winter mai jaaye or enjoy kare is best for winter
A very popular place recently added,It is a very large park added in recent years in memory of a past leader of India and attracts large number of visitors every day. It is well maintained and presents a neat and clean look.
Grand architecture ,The Dr. ambedkar park is definitely having the grand architecture and the place is a must visit place.
Good Place ,"The place is good to visitHuge place and you should visit thecplace in night so not too hot, so you can enjoy it. Lots of elephant are placed there.If you are in Lucknow than you cant miss this place."
Thanks for  brilliant design to all engineers,"This park is really good for hangout with friends and family,its cover huge areabut best time to visit in evening.and morning walkers too."
Marvelous dream of a politician,It took lot of time to build this place but the end result is good. This place is not must but one should visit. It is very big park and not recommended to visit in summer until it's raining or pleasent weather.
Concrete Park,Actually it is not a park because few trees are planted there. This place was very hot during afternoon. Ticket is there to go inside. Photography is allowed free of cost. This place can be skipped if you are tight on schedule.
Awesome!!,"Here is the rememberance of our great Babasaheb!!This place is awesome, I can't describe it in words!!"
Dr.  Ambedkar park,Very excellent and peaceful place to visit.The facilities here are excellent.The park is spread over many acres and many beautiful things are here to see.This is a place which everyone should visit.
Good place to visit,Recent monument dedicated to great BR Ambedkar. Should be visited during evening hours as it can be really hot in the day time.
Nice place to spend time .,Nice place to spend time with friends and family.Entry charge is of about 15 per person.There is water cooler available for visitors.And public toilet is also good.Nice spots to click the pictures.
Ambedkar Park,Dr. Ambedkar Park in Gomti Nagar is a good place to go for evening stroll. It has been beautifully constructed.
Not best place to visit,"It hold no historic significance, architecture tries to mimic old Buddhist design but fails miserably."
Best place in Lucknow,Visited this place few days back with family. It's one of the most beautiful place in entire Uttar Pradesh. A must visit.
Place is okay.,I visited this place in March 2018 with my friends. This place contains many statues and buildings. There are less number of trees or plants so this place is okay for visit. This was built by Mayavati the Ex Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.
Where is the park?,"I wish there was some greenery at this 'park'. A vast expanse of granite, floors, statues, pillars, everything. DON'T GO IN SUMMER MONTHS. Definitely not in the afternoon. Evenings maybe. Since it is all stone, it's hot in the summers and cold in the winters. Having said that, it does make a pretty picture when the weather is right."
New Lucknow,"Ambedkar park is so beautiful neat and clean , it is very good thing made by Maywati for Lucknow , it is entrance fee very little just Rs.20 but at night night it looks very nice , one should who visit Lucknow must visit this park, it give look of new modern Lucknow, surrounding ares are also well maintained. Very nice to see."
very big park ,very big area cover and gud them  parkentry ticket is 100 rs but bed menor use by mayavati big statu
Awesome park,"A must visist to this place, it have entry ticket of rs. 20. It is best viewed in after the afternoon till night. the park itself is self explanatory why it is beautiful and why should one visit, the beautiful views , the big elephants, the lights in night and the big idols. all in all best place to visit."
The finest creation of lucknow! ,"I can not express the original feeling which felt at that time when i visited there with my friends, it was too big to walk and so much things like structures, unique plants, lightings, fountains, pictures etc.. it is the mirror of real modern lucknow. must visit once. But please keep some food, some energy drink to make your trip more crunchy. And visit in cloudy or rainy season."
Disappointing,Go here if you have nothing else to do in the evening. Perhaps a nice open place to just sit and chat after sunset. Nothing much to do or to see otherwise.
A monstrous structure full of stone elephants,"A large complex with replicas of buddhist stupas and stone elephants in fountains, as a a large congregation etc. Seem to be waste of money, serving no material purpose"
Waste of money,It is huge construction. Lot of money wasted in building this by politicians. If the same amount was used for building super speciality hospital which offers free service then it would have been great!
beautifull park,is too good and big one so guys if u go after the sun set because is some reason so go and enjoy the park an beautiful elephant
Political monument,It is a beautiful park with nice architecture. There are minimal entry charges for entry to the park. It is also an example of politicising one’s own agenda as the massive stone work including numerous elephant statues have been enacted which also resemble the election symbol of ruling party at that point of time.
Amazing Park,I think this is one of the amazing park which I have ever visited. This park is built by Mayawati ji and is covering a large area. The architecture work done here is really one of the best. Visit this park only after sunset to feel the real beauty of the park.
Govt wasted public money,Such parks and building developed by govt are example of wasting money recd from public as taxes. Such parks are not meant for family. You may caught couples in compromising position which is shame on our society.
Wonderful monument,Wonderful monument to the advocates of social change in India and dedicated to the nation. Enormous area with large statues and elephants and only 15 Rs entry fee. Very clean and well maintained. Visit duration 2-3 hours. A must see venue when in Lucknow.
Nice park,"Ambedkar Memorial Park is a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is more formally known as Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal (Hindi: डॉ. भीमराव अम्बेडकर सामाजिक परिवर्तन प्रतीक स्थल ) and is also referred to simply as ""Ambedkar Park"". The park honors the lives and memories of Jyotirao Phule, Narayana Guru, Birsa Munda, Shahuji Maharaj, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and all those who've devoted their life for humanity, equality and social justice. The memorial was constructed by Mayawati, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, during her administration when she led the Bahujan Samaj Party."
Ambedkar Park,Ambedkar park is a very beautiful park in Lucknow city India...this made by BSP government of uttar Pradesh..
Dr Ambedkar Park is with full of huge elephant statues.,The park is very neat and clean and is having very huge statues of elephants. It is built on the banks of Gomthi river. Visitors can see once this park. Since its clean and neat people surrounding to the park who effort to pay an entry of Rs 15/- can daily enjoy the walk  and specially it is good in the evenings the beauty of water fountains. The entire park needs at least 3 to 4 hours to see.
Humongous man made marvel,It is a huge park and will require lots of energy to roam the entire park. It has amazing lighting in the evenings and a must visit place while in Lucknow
Beautiful park kept very clean,"Unlike the traditional parks where there are flowers and trees, this one reverses the formula with complete granite flooring and many statues. It's a beautiful place which needs at least 2+ hours. You can spend more time but you should be able to walk. No food is available. The elephant sections cant be missed."
Elephant Park,"This place is very beautiful and photogenic, an excellant place to visit during evening time to get the best views with the lights on, this place is built with granite marble and specialized maintenance free stones for walls, there are lots of elephant statues done for some personalized reasons and water fountains which were not working during our visit, here they charge Rs 15/- per person as entry charges, the toilet rooms for public use were in bad shape with no lights and bad up keeps, needs an urgent look into this to maintain the repute of this place."
Family visit,Worth enjoying in winter season . Must spend approx. An hour to see entire park.  Near by is Gomti River front which should be a evening visit.
Huge Park,Its not a Park because normally we found in the park Flowers and plant how ever here every where marvel along with Elephant and statue. But look wise its marvels.
Grand Park,This is a grand park with almost no green. Lots and lots of elephants of all sizes. Good architecture and one must visit the place... You can ignore huge statues of political leaders.You can spend 2-3 hours at this place.
Big monument,Lot of money and efforts into creating a landmark monument for centuriesBig space well maintained and beauty to watch.. must visit a place in Lucknow
Nothing Great,"Having seen the Park in Noida built by former CM Mayawati, I felt there was nothing new here. Only plus point was that it was on bank of the River"
"Large Park,well maintained","This is a large park on the banks of the river GomtiWell maintained walking tracks,play areas and seatingLot of greenery,plants,trees"
First,Was good Decoration and ambience would say was above par..even for .......the local community surely a peaceful place to hangout....
Huge park,"It's a huge park with many facilities like toilets, drinking water and music near the tracks always on, good lighting, entry ticket is Rs-20 per once , one can get monthly pass too, parking space available nothing to eat or enjoy here"
Picnic ,This is a park  and a picnic place for family in vacation time. It's is spread in very huge area and looking very beautiful.  From  a heavy crowd to a piece full place but during a vacation you also feel crowded place but that is more enjoyable.
Nice visit 👌 ,Its near my home and build beautiful we can travel a lot and also have nice places to take a selfie. Nevertheless all is good for that amount.
A Politician's Monument to Herself,"Be that as it may, this is a monumental complex adding a public domain for the public to the city of Lucknow, and making the city a grander place to live. The craftsmanship of the stone work is excellent and quality of materials and work has not been sacrificed for the typical PWD inverted way of self service!"
Useless place,Useless place. Wastage of time and money. Made only of marble. No greenery inside. In summers u will be fried inside and in winters u will be shivering. No concept nothing. Just a monument of dr. b. R. Ambedkar ji. The place holds no historical value. U will repent after going there. So dont waste ur tym in going there.
Vast marble clad park,Stunning looking park with huge marble clad steps and some massive buildings and statues.There are collonades of huge elephants that look amazing. It is hard to understand how big this park really is until you decide to walk to an area to look closely and it takes you 20 minutes to get there.Overall well worth a visit but make sure you have drinks and comfy shoes
Ambedkar park,Nice place to visit with freinds n family... Calm and peaceful.. Thers an entry fee but that is worthfull..
amazing ,this is something huge and pride of lucknow .u can visit this place as with your friends and family also .huge area good environmental feel make u smiling and happy .
Go only a cloudy day or evening only,"Beautifully done, but no shade at all.  A park with no trees, lots of elephants.  Lovely place, but since we went on a sunny morning, could not fully enjoy it."
Dr Ambedkar Park,"Ambedkar Park or Ambedkar Udyan in Lucknow in Gomti Nagar area is the new tourist attraction in Lucknow. This is a huge place built on the banks of the river Gomati. However, there is no green in it though the park is spread on 107 acres of prime land. It is all stone and have huge statues of few important leaders. There are more than 3,000 elephants including big and small statues here."
When can enjoy the magnificat construction and the Exotic plant,It is a beautiful park in Lucknow. When you will go to Lucknow then go to Ambedkar park. It's a nice place to go to with kids. The open space is good for strolling and one can enjoy the magnificent construction and the Exotic plant.
Nothing much in it,"This is a huge place built almost on the banks of the river Gomati. However, unlike as expected from a par, there is no green in it. It is all stone with broad walkways and three halls in three different directions that have huge statues of few important Dalit leaders. One of the halls is built like the Colosseum but is not at all impressive."
Park of stones and elephants!!,"It was made by Mayawati, former chief minister of UP. One should visit this place in morning or evening."
Unusual and interesting monument,Worth spending an hour or two if you like interesting architecture and aesthetics plus some interesting things to learn about the reason for the park - commemorating key figures in the recent struggle to abolish the caste system.
Garish display of public money wastage,"We should learn from our politicians how to waste public money. Giant elephants with huge stone carved statues of politicians. Sure, you will have a nice time but such a waste of public money is shameful"
Lung of the City,Huge Park of about hundred acres... With lot of walkways and seating areas.... Located on the Gomti riverfront .... Because of time constraint I had to visit in the day time ... After 6 p.m to 9 P.M is the best time ... With all the lights on....
Good place,Good place but needs more maintenance to attract tourists. Overall good for one time visiting. The architecture is very well built.
walk  around,Beautifully planned and constructed .... maintained by state govt. must visit if you are at lucknow specially couples
Ambedkar Park,"it's amazing , really such a classy park is located in Lucknow,  but my suggestion please come in evening time , because of his lighting view, such a fantastic view"
Very vast !,"This is a beautiful park cum memorial dedicated to Dr.Bhim Rao Ambedkar and other social reformers of India like Kanshi Ram, Birsa Munda, Narayan Guru etc.  The construction of this memorial cum park commenced in 1995 during the period when Mayawati was CM of Uttar Pradesh. The place houses Ambedkar stupa and statues of several social reformers of India.  It's lush green place and very well maintained. It is spread across several acres of land."
Awesome ,Very nice place to visit... Architecture is awesome... Everyone must visit this place if anyone visit to lko...
nice place to visit,This is nice place to visit you can see the elephants made of stone. This place was developed by Ms Mayawati
Over hyped,This place can easily be skipped from Lucknow tour. Other than time pass no reason to visit here.  It has covered a large area of ground and occupied with huge structures and elephants. None of the water features were operational.
Amazing ,"This was a last minute choice however it should be at the top of everyone's list to see.  Very cheap (R10) place to spent at least an hour and a half.33 acres of granite and stone with numerous huge beautifully designed buildings. Although very open and hot, peace and shade can be found in the calming stone buildings. The never ending avenue of numerous (too many to count) elephants is breathtaking.The only let down is that all the water features weren't operating.The quotes from famous Indian people is enlightening."
Glorious place,It is one of the best place for spending time. Looking wise good. Suno na sangmarmar song is shooted here.  many other movies also shooted here
Ambedkar park,Me and my girlfriend are both going....in Ambedkar park.... biggest elephant here and many. People come here.
A concrete jungle,Does not go with the general ambience and style of the city. This city is fast losing its charismatic beauty. The overhead metro will be the death knell.
A GOOD PLACE BUT POORLY MAINTAINED ,The place is good specially at night but maintainace is very poor.in evening very few lights are working there max portion of the park is in dark.one time watch.at day time it's a scorching place...avoid at day time.
Most Beautiful,"I have been here for just 2 times so far, it's beauty has fascinated me. It's remains very great. Must visit place for everyone."
Big park,This is big park where lots of statues are there..one of is mayawati statue..greeny garden with lots of tree ..entry fee is only rs10
Leisure,It's nice but not maintained well. Half of the lights were not working. With 10 rs entry few this may be the only possible alternative. Everything was cool except ugly mayawati statues years dozens of them. Perfect pic opportunity however need 2 be publicised.
"Nice park , but nothing attractive","U have to pay for entry ticket, available for monthly pass also, as u walk around on track music is played , by speakers fitted near tracks , a huge statue of Baba Ambedkar, clean toilets, drinking water, security guards at each 700-800 meter, nice to have a walk"
sight seeing,I was curious to see this place but was really appalled at the wastage of public money. No doubt Dr. Ambedkar is a national icon and all Indians look up to him but can't agree with the wasteful opulence of the place. Just the statue of him with the museum would have been enough and the park should have had trees and gardens to walk around and contemplate on his history....not walking around under the hot sun on blocks of marble and granite. Also the elephants are put there for the political party's identity which was not necessary; much better use could have been made of the money spent here.
Recently built Park,This Park was built some years back during Mayawati Government. It is inundated with Lord Budhhas statues. This is more of a weekend getaway for the localites
AMAZING PARK,Its the biggest park in the city . Its one of the famous  tourists place and most of them never miss to visit this place. Its nice place to hangout with your families or even friends in the evening time.
A concrete park,"Huge park, made of marble and elephant statues. Nothing much to see. Not much crowded too. Can visit it to see stone structures and statues. Personally, did not like it much."
Dr. Ambedkar Park,This place who has developed by LDA team part of Gomti Nagar who Chief minister of Mayawati has been announced to built this placed
Elephant statues.,"Though this is called a park, there's hardly any green cover. Sure it  is vast ,  but the sight of stone structures/ walls  all around; just too many doesn't inspire. Nothing much to do or learn or observe here. Can be easily skipped."
Huge stone park,The park is huge. The grand layout of the park is very pleasent to eye. The park is well maintained. Giant stone elephants are placed in a row. Peaceful and good place to spend time with your loved ones.
Beautiful,"Nice building with great architecture, this is so beautiful, many movies get shooted here. This is a prideful thing for Lucknow. Mayavati ji has done good work."
A nice place to visit and be a spectator for the mordern architecture,A nice place to visit and be a spectator for the mordern architecture which are beautifully crafted and sculptured.
A nice place to visit in Lucknow,"Ambedkar  Park is a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. The park honors the lives and memories of Jyotirao Phule, Narayana Guru, Birsa Munda, Shahuji Maharaj, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and all those who've devoted their life for humanity, equality and social justice. The memorial was constructed by Ms Mayawati, the Honbl’e Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, during her administration when she led the Bahujan Samaj Party.The foundation stone of the memorial was first laid in 1995.  It was initially opened to the public on 14 April 2008 by Ms Mayawati, the Honbl’e Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.The entire memorial is built using red sandstone brought from Rajasthan. It is situated in the posh locality of Gomti Nagar, the largest planned residential colony in India. Cost of the memorial is estimated at 7 billion Indian rupees.Its name was changed from Ambedkar Park to Bhimrao Ambedkar memorial in May 2012.This construction is the heart of the entire memorial. The sanctum sanctorum consists of many statues depicting the biography of Ambedkar. There are four doors in opposite directions. There is a statue of Ambedkar seated in a chair, facing towards the two domes.Opposite to the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial is a museum, constructed over an area of about 11,000 sq.m. The building has two domes on top. It contains large statues of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, Shri Narayan Guru, Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar and Shri Kanshiram.

Very nice,Truly a memorable destination to roam with friens and family.Please try once to have beauty of UP and its historical place to enjoy and for your memory.
Ambedkar park at Lucknow,It's a very nice and beautiful park must see attraction at LucknowSituated near the outskirts of gomti river it is all made up off marble stones with the different art work and form of elephant entry fee is just nominal 10 rs but to visit in the evening is the best time as marble floor are hot at the day time
Loved the fountain lights at night,"I went to the riverfront park, as this is called while I was staying at Lucknow in the Gomti nagar area. The park is very large and spread over a vast area. I had visited in the evening, and it's an easy to locate landmark of Lucknow. There is the park with lovely grass that you can laze on, the Gomti river that you can watch from the sides of the park. Around 8:30 ish there is a light and sound (Bollywood music) play of the fountains and it is quite entertaining to watch. The place is quite crowded in the evening."
The park is one of its own kind...unique due to its stone work.,A Nice place to visit .It has a large space covered with gardens and the area coverd by stone is also quite large. It should be visited in the evening to see the lights.
A huge Park,This park is really a huge park and very well maintained. You will find a series of Huge Statues of Elephants in a line. Statues of Ambedkar and Mayawati can also be seen inside big halls of the part.
Holidays in lucknow,I visited to this place was good view were good nd good place for spend time with friends. Such a big park nd big statue of Dr.ambedkar
Designs & Architecture of this park is really impressive.,"Ambedkar Memorial Park is a public park and honors the lives and memories of Jyotirao Phule, Narayana Guru, Birsa Munda, Shahuji Maharaj, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and all those who've devoted their life for humanity, equality and social justice. I visited Dr Ambedkar Park, Gomti Nagar Lucknow for several times. Here one can find great concept of architecture. You will find beautiful pillars, domes, lovely elephant statues etc. Designs & Architecture of this park is really impressive."
A day well spent,Spend the day at Ambedkar park as it was cloudy and windy. The support of the weather and beauty of the architecture made the place amazing
Masti ,Awesome park but waste of money by government although happy to visit it is too big Nd enough to play many games with friends ..it is just near to gomti river
At picnic,"I went this park at picnic with my friends, nice place for picnic, we do much fun here, we took some food with us, that was a perfect picnic."
Worth 7 Billion Rs!,"The park is dedicated to Dr BR Ambedkar and was constructed at a cost of rs 700 crore. The park is situated in Gomti nagar in Lucknow and is known for the wonderful bronze statues of Ambedkar, mayavati, and various saints. The Pratibimb Sthalin in the center of the park is guarded by 62 life like elephant statues which is one of the highlights of this park. There is an entrance fee of 10 rs which is nothing compared to the wonderful experience inside."
Stone Bounded,"A place where is lot of stone work, just a  side of Gomti River, lot of Elephants Sculpture , Making of park Buddhist Architecture, Unique place roming few time"
I was not in lucknow😲,"OMG 😲. So mesmerising. I have been visited lucknow many time,but never been at Ambedkar Park. But trust me once you visited you never want to come back."
Amazing Its a very good park built recently in Lucknow. Everyone must visit this park once with their families.,Wow what a fantastic day .Its a very good park built recently in Lucknow. Everyone must visit this park once with their families.
In the memories of great politician,this place is just next to Vivanta by taj gomti nagar lucknow ..its a great place to visit ... you enjoy some great welcome by the stone structure of lots of elephants on either side. followed by two dome like structures in which you get to know about some great leaders who rule the country by their majesty thorough which today you are able to live the Independent life ... each and everything is made of imported marble so dare not to visit it in summers as it really get too hot out there .
A very nice park ,Dr. Ambedkar Park is quite beautiful and peaceful. Good for morning and evening walk and visitors also.
Nice architect with less maintainence,"Was part of evening tour and enjoyed well and experience Designs and architecture were awesome make impressive tooOnly thing some of the stone are not well maintain during time as polished of elephants on the second side ,marbles on the floor was not settled properly, some of stones of the stairs brakedPeoples split  tobaccos sides of the wallless dustbins for garbage lighting are not working properly It is good product to promote for  Lucknow tourism and to make us proud have like Dr.Amedbkar Ji memorial park  in India"
Mordern architecture,A vast land to cover in a single day. Very good place. Big monuments specially elephants. A good place to be and have spend an entire day in learning and seeing this eye treat.
Awesome experience at lucknow,Its a very good park built recently in Lucknow. Everyone must visit this park once with their families.
Awesome,Awesome place to be in. I went there in the evening and it was very nice to see the place in lights. Must see in Lucknow
Worth visit,"Dr. Ambedkar park is very big park. One needs to buy a ticket to enter the park. This is just good to visit to see its architecture and buildings. There is nothing to visit. This park lacks water, sanitation and fooding facilities."
Place worth sending couple of hrs with friends or family.,"Good place but needs regular maintenance. Ok for few hrs to roam around, sit or relax.  Crowded on weekends."
Soo beautiful park and silence,It is a memorial park and museum. Many historical thing are their we have to see and learn. Many people visiting that park and enjoying with friends and family
"A great place to see, ","I visited Dr Ambedkar Park, Gomti Nagar Lucknow for several times. This Memorial Park is made by Ms. Mayawati the then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. You will see the great concept of architecture. You will find glossy pillars, beautiful domes, well finished elephant statues etc. Ambedkar Park is a must visit place of Lucknow."
places to visit in lucknow,"Its newly constructed park in the name of Dalit icon .Constructed by mayawati govt.The place is good to visit in evening.Plus:1.New architecture,provides good photo points especially from top during evening.2.sprawling,will provide your legs the workout.3.safe.Minus:1.Cant visit in the morning or afternoon as stone will heat up and there is no shaded areas,a flaw of the architect.2.No greenery,nothing much to do inside except take a stroll and come out"
Visit to Ambedkar park,"A new addition in the list of monuments to be visited in Lko. A creation of Mayawati, it is a place/park made of granite and marble with murals of Dalit leaders and elephants. A very well designed monument and a place to visit in Lko."
imposing and impressive,"A must visit in the city of Lucknow.  A blend of imposing pillars,beautifully manicured gardens and domes. A treat for the eye.  Reasonably priced entrance fee. It is clean and well maintained."
An evening in Lucknow,Must visit in evening with your spouse or family. The water and music show is completely breathtaking.Have some quality time there.
show of strength,visited there in the month of mar 16 and was disappointed to see that the park is just show of strength of some particular political party or group. Though the work is outstanding and exceptional and it must have taken lot of financial resources from the exchequer.
TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT-COLOSSAL WASTE OF MONEY,"Biggest disappointment of Modern Lucknow, the place shows how public money is wasted on whims and fancies of our political leaders.Maybe the ruins after few decades will be 'worth a visit'. :)"
What a waste of resources.,"Undoubtedly very grand, it impresses by the richness of the specifications but saddens one at the thought of how many hospitals or schools could have been built only using the money spent on the granite here.Too much climbing up and down involved so we just went to the main structure and came back.Magnificent and saddening at the same time."
This is a must to visit monument,"THis park of plants, tress with statues of icons of depressed society of India was built by Miss mayawati the  then Chief Minister of the State of UP, of which Lucknow is capital.  Its construction and landscaping shows the royal taste of Miss Mayawati.  It has a sprawling area on the banks of Gomti River. Though the expenditures made by the Government on these parks and statues is  criticised by some , but after visiting this place, I am sure you will have a different opinion."
"Beautiful complex, Great Architeccture","First impression we get the Monumental and grand scale of Architecture in this park..very unique buildings, Sculptures and huge open space  with excellent and skillful details have been found here. The rows of life-size statues of elephants , fountains, walkways are very nicely placed . The sunset view here is just awesome.. and then the night view of the complex . It's in city centre of Lucknow ... we visited in January, 2015 .evening time is good to visit the complex."
"Monument to contributions of dalits, including the man who drafted Indian Constitution","This impressive plaza and architectural monuments attracted me the first time I saw it in the dawn mist from the 14th floor of our hotel nearby. We drove past it every time we left the hotel. Our final day, I attempted to walk from our hotel, but found that the wall surrounding the park (apparently) has only one entrance and is accessed directly from a busy highway. Better to take a taxi or autotaxi (tuktuk) to visit. This is a monument to a modern age in a city that feels modern. I did, however, enjoy walking along the Park's south wall (the new Gomti River park) and a short portion of western wall, taking in the sites and action around Ambedkar Park, then returned to our hotel to check out and depart for (architecturally interesting) Raj-era Charbagh train station."
Great architectural visit...,"This place is a great hanging out place for picnics in Lucknow... Located prominently, this is a big place and requires an entire day to have a complete experience of the place... Build recently, this place projects a glimpse of modern architecture..."
A purpose gone astray with opulent display,This well kept park n memorial was constructed over a period of 11 years & was opened in 2008. It stands as a mark of respect to those indian leaders who came from downtrodden masses & tried to give societal justice n equality to their poor brethren. The most famous amongst these being Dr Ambedkar. While the purpose of this memorial is noble but the display of construction n 100 elephants lined along it's path sadly borders on a gross n almost vulgar display of monetary outflow.
NEW SIDE OF LUCKNOW,Well This Is A Park In Gomti Nagar. Its Huge and beautifully Built. Its has no trees thats only bad side of this park from my point of view. Dont visit to this park in mid summers afternoon. It Gets real hot. Its Good Place To Visit.
Concrete Park,It is not a park because there are few trees inside. The structure and the flooring is made of marbles. It is hot even in the month of February because sun rays are reflected from the marble surface. A lot of money is wasted to form this concrete park.
Nice park,"I visited this several times when i go to Lucknow this park made in memory of Dr Ambedkar , it's very beautiful. it's very beautiful"
Vast!,"There's a sense here of the vast space of suññatā. Wonderful. I'm now feeling I have to come back again sometime to experience it. Strange, because there's really nothing there..."
Impressive ,OK was totally impressed .. Our reason to.come here was different ..We had few hours in Lucknow and just heard that pm was to be here for a sermon on up politics and vote begging of course ..how could we miss the melee?Even though we were much early..a visit was much in order .I was expecting some ramleela type of.ground and was pleasantly surprised to see this state of art park of concrete and statues ..red stone and huge elephant statues and pillars and everything oh so nice ..I thought it lacked greenery but it was massive and impressive .Caught the hsutings being hurriedly erected ..arrangements made at frenetic pace ..and the people sauntering in out of curiosity ..Definitely recommend it to.people who.are tourists .Atleast for me it worked purely coz..I didn't expect this..
Selfie destination,It is a good selfie place. here you can click more and more pics beacause you will find a loving background here.
Historic,A must view place of Lucknow. You just cannot ignore it whenever you visit or explore Lucknow. Must watch.
A very good place for family and friends to hang aroung,"ambedkar park is a decent , nice, clean and a very good place to hang aroung with its good attractive spots inside the ambedkar park"
Waste of Public Money,"Heard that lots of natural land, trees were cut down to bring up this Park made up of concrete, stones and statues. It is so massive that you wont be able to see anything further with your naked eyes. Lots of red-stone have been used in this park.. you will find towering statues of Elephants almost everywhere and 2 big statues of political leaders of the state. Lacks green lawn and trees. Needs proper care and maintenance. Often frequented by love-birds to get some personal space."
Excellent,"This Ambedkar Park is beautiful place for all age groups . It is so neat & clean Place that you can see mirror image of yours. Very systematic  & stylish Plants you can see there. You can have tasty meal Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast etc.just opposite Ambedkar park in Gov. Canteen across the road."
A Very treacherous place too walk with leather soled shoes once it has rained.,This is a park on a massive scale with very few trees in sight. The stones are polished and very treacherous to walk on with leather soled shoes on a rainy day. Rows and rows of elephants with their lower half supported by even more stones reeks of poor design strength of the idols.Not quite sure of the purpose of such a park.
Huge park in Lucknow,"We were told a bit about this park before arrival, but nothing can prepare you for the immense size of the place! Walking between the rows of gigantic elephants was an experience in itself.The few trees in the park were trimmed uniquely, but more greenery and water would make the place very lovely."
Huge garden space,Ambedkar park is near to gomti nagar and this park was brainchild of Mayawati due her last tenure. Place is huge and very clean. The park was in limelight due to big elephant sculptures which were Mayawati's party symbol
"Lavishly done, Park,","Ambedkar Park, honors the  memories of Jyotirao Phule, Narayana Guru, Birsa Munda, Shahuji Maharaj, Bhimrao Ambedkar,and  Kanshi Ram .. The memorial was constructed by Mayawati, the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, . Many differ in their views about the huge sum of public money spent for building this monument. So I am not sure, whether one will feel happy or unhappy after visiting this place .Otherwise a great work."
made of stone,"if in lucknow for the first time its ok to visit the park once. its completely made of stone and structures of elephant., statue of ambedkar etc can be see"
Elephants Elephants,"When we visited this on a Sunday evening, there were only about 20 visitors including us. Did not appear to be very popular with the locals. The arrangements and the ambience is good, still it gives a sort of bitter taste about the abuse of Power and waste of Public funds in India. There are many life size elephant statues lined up inside."
Good ,It is better than noida park also the lighting is very good and the architecture is also different but if anybody wants to avoid they can do it
Example of Modern Art,"It's a creation of modern art in 20th century.....You can enjoy more during the sunny day. From the top, you can look the surrounding of Lucknow areas.Magnificent creation....Fantastic Architecture....."
All stone and no greenery,This is a massive spread of stone devoid of greenery. Nice only when weather is mild otherwise cold in winter and hot in summer. Nothing recreational and no amusement. Nice to look at but not worth getting inside.
Magnificent recreational area !!,"This park has everything magnificent. Starting from gates and waiting area to the main attractions : parks,statues and elephants.This place has a central piller encrypted on which is the history of this place and significance of the place.This is no doubt a good picnic place as it has many big size parks."
Very good park,The park is very good. It was built by Uttar Pradesh Government and located in Gomti nagar. A good architecture and well planed park makes it attractive to tourists.
Good place for leisure time,Big structures and big domes occupied in large area of land. Located in center of the city. Fully made up of Marbles including floors. Not advisable to go in between 11 am to 6pm because of sunlight absorbed and emission by marbles. Must see. Hardly take 1-2 hours time.
Park of elephant status ..!!!,"On one fine noon we visited this attraction, the park seems to be newly built, it was just world class, tall structures, tall elephant status, bronze pillars, no words to describe, the park was soo spacious, the place was soo attractive during rainy season, the fountain at the centre adds extra beauty, the attraction houses very good parking space, kids will fall in love at this place, the entry fees were also soo nominal... overall we had a fine time over here...!!!!"
"Dr. Ambedkar park, Lucknow",This is a fantastic piece of architectural beauty in marble. But the big question is the colossal amount of revenue that should have gone in this venture just to satisfy the ego of one single person. The same amount could have gone to many many welfare measures.
Decent Park,Visit this on a breezy day and get to the top of the center building to look around some fascinating sights of the city!
Wastage of money and time,"A huge monument spread in a big area. Maintenance is not proper.If you are in Lucknow, you may  go here atleast once, to see this place. It has no trees, a lot of statues of elephants , mayawati, kanshiram, ambedkar. Only stone and stone.  You may feel wastage of money and time in both- building this monument and visiting this monument."
Good to see ,This place is centrally located and can be reached from all places of Lucknow. Well mentioned place and people's of all the age can enjoy there.
Excellent architectural masterpiece,"Once you are inside , you will feel like you are in some palace. Its a huge place with marbles and granite everywhere. Good for some photoshoots"
Heaven in Lucknow,"It is One of the modern park  in Lucknow. It is best for walking in the evening time. The most popular song "" suno na sangmarmer"" shooted at this place. It looks awesome during sunset."
Lovely,Nice to see Lucknow getting such an attraction for locals and travellers. Excellent architecture and very well maintained. Tickets to get in are very cheap too. All in all a great day out. Highly recommend.
Wastage wastage wastage,Sheer wastage of moneyI hate to say this but I don't see a point on spending around 6000 crores on a park .Bummer
An Evening at the memorial,One fine evening in the month of Dec 2015 decided with my wife to revisit this place when the stone structures don't radiate heat.The lay out was looking  impressive with the lights on.Wish they had put on all lights.Statute of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar is impressive.Wish they shud arrange for a guided tour or a  Light and sound show .
beautiful monument cast in stone,"wish the architects of this great place had thought of planting some traditional trees to enhance the beauty of marble.red sandstone and concrete.the statues ,the myriad elephants ,the tombs,gates all have their own charm but look stony without a green cover.these were built by Mayavati,erstwhile CM. THE HUGE SPACES ARE GOOD AND IN THE EVENING THE GENTLE BREEZE FROM THE GOMTI RIVER ON A GOOD WEATHER DAY ADDS TO THE CHARM."
Visit Only In Winters,This is one of the best places in Lucknow to be visited but only during the winters because the entire area is floored with the sandstone and there is absolutely no shed in the entire area....but in winters you will love it as you will enjoy the scenic beauty and the warmth of the sun too. Other than that the place is really amazing and you will definitely love the long series of elephants on both the sides of the gallery....Really mesmerizing.
Perfect place at Evening time,"Situated at Gomtinagar,easily you can reach over here.In evening it looks very nice.When all the lights are on the park are shining.whole park is covered by marble.Lots of elephant statue are over there.The park is very well maintain and the entry fee is also very less.you can also seat in their lawn take fresh breath."
Amazing Architecture,Its a place one should visit. One can spend about more than 3 hrs to go around. it was an wonderful experience with my family.
Nyc place .,Nyc place to visit at evening time. Peaceful place u just want to sit and look at the sky . The only drawback is the advertisement of BSP .
Most expensive constructed site in lucknow,Most beautiful place constructed recently. it is in gomti nagar.spending evening time is most memorable moment.You need a good time to visit it
Must Visit In Lucknow,This is one of the most peaceful and beautiful tourist places I have visited.If possible one should visit it in daylight as well as night time.This place is of significant importance and should be a must visit place when in Lucknow.
Concrete Jungle,It’s a huge park but when you enter this you  find yourself into the concrete jungle.  Instead of Plants you will see the architecture and buildings ( full of stone works without much greenery ) .Elephants statue is everywhere (You can find more elephant here then Kenya's Masai Mara national Park :) .Can Visit once if you have free time
Suno Na SangeMarmar..... :),"It one of the best place to visit in Lucknow. It is quite large park or memorial you can say. It would be good to visit in evening as it is full of marble so going in afternoon doesn't make any sense. We visited this park quite long ago, and best part ........it was raining. It was an awesome experience. Remember famous SUNO NA SANGE MARMAR song from movie Youngistan...that was shot here itself."
Dr. Ambedkar Park,it is very good place to visit it is must visiting place in lucknow . the architecture is good the marbel work is very good the lightning is excellent
Stone work,"A place in Lucknow to visit during winter season only.As the place is full of stone works without much greenery, it can not be named as a park but monument."
A work of art ,Having driven past this site to see another. I just had to come back and see it. Truly a work of art in what has been built here. Every part of the park is something completely different but works in harmony with all the other's. Not to be left out of the sites to visit in Lucknow.
Marvelous,"This is a modern marvel,architect at its Best.It has a beauty that is peerless.Carved out of red sandstone,it mesmerise you.Its right in the centre of Lucknow on river gomti banks.Must see"
Huge park,Beautiful location. I've been here during the day and the night times. Both times it was brilliant. Highly recommended.
Lavish..,"Symbol of lavishness, concrete jungle in the midst of city....Not maintained with poor toilet facilities. Anyway worth seeing for its grandness...."
Amazing Architectural Extravaganza,"Marvelous & expansive: modern architectural wonder inspired with Pink City, Roman & Mauryan Designs. Extensive use of Pink Sand Stone."
It's sunny but nice,"I had to go on a sunny day, it was little bit sunny, but it's good for relaxing, for exercising and to spent your lesure"
Worth visiting place.,This is most controversial place (politicaly) but wonderful peace of architecture constructed by Mayawati ex chief minister of UP.
Interesting,"I have mixed reviews about this - it is quite grandiose, and it looked magnificent as we passed by it one evening. When you enter into it, you will still find it quite grand, but also quite strange. There is no greenery, just marble structures all around, and more elephants than you can count. It might not be a very good place to visit in the blinding heat of Lucknow, with the fiery hot marble blazing beneath you, and also reflecting right into your eyes. Reserve it for cooler evenings, and a leisurely walk around the huge complex."
"Must see, Its amazing place",I visited there with my family and every one likes this place so much. Its amazing park made by UP Govt in memory of Dr. Ambedkar. Its located at Gomti Nagar and any one can like this place. Full paisa vasool place.
Remarkable!!!,All stone place with big big statues of elephants. It has very less greenery and lot of stone so not good fr summer day visit as the place gets too hot.Landscape s good. Nice place to click photographs
Great place to hangout with family,"This is really nice place to visit. This place is so huge, spread in hundred of acres. It has 2 views , visiting in night is completely different exp than visiting in day time. It is easily located in gomtinagar. This is unique place in India recently built. Floor marble are so clean and sparkling like mirror."
Nice huge park!,Elephants all around in a nicely maintained park. Good work in city centre! Rs 10 is the entry charge which helps in maintaining the decorum of the park
Good to visit but not so exsiting,there is nothing special to visit here the only thing is that if weather is good then only you take a look of this park to enjoy the weather.
Suno na sangemarmar,Yes! This song was shot there. Beautiful location. I've been here during the day and the night times. Both times it was brilliant (if Lucknow weather is benevolent to you). Good place to spend quality time with friends/family.
Tribute to the greatest,There could beno better way to thank the great leader who gave us our constitution. It's very beautiful and the worksmanship reflects. Must see
Massive concrete park...!!,"The place is massive, and has huge potential to become a tourist hotspot.  But the political oneup manship has not let that happen. The park is quite popular with the locals, especially at night, when the road surrounding it is quite well lit and dotted with foodstalls. Icecream vendors seem to be the most sought after on a post dinner drive.I would recommend that you do visit this place. It is an awe-inspiring structure constructed in the post British era."
Park on Concrete on Bank of River Gomati,"It Situated on Bank of River Gomati. you can said it park on concrete. You can not find tree in the this Park. But it you can take it as a good looking concrete park. It also good design and new era archeological wonder in city of Lucknow. I can not find any people with in the park except only security guards. It also well decorate, clean and well communicate."
A leisurely evening in Ambedkar Park Lucknow !,"Ambedkar Park is located in one of the most posh areas of Lucknow, Gomti Nagar. The whole park is built with red stones which give a rustic feel to the architecture. There are many sections in the park and the main section showcases a huge statue of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar with an inscription in Hindi which readsमेरा जीवन संघर्ष ही मेरा संदेश है(Mera jeevan sangharsh hi mera sandesh hai )My struggle of life is my only message.I didn’t get a chance to visit all the sections as I had very little time in hand but the area showcasing Elephants in two parallel lanes is definitely a highlight. Each row has 62 huge Elephants standing tall and sturdy.If you keep walking along this lanes of Elephants you would come across a huge wall structure which possesses the overall map of the park. You can enjoy a holistic view of the park from this point.A good time to visit this park would be after sunset, because then you will be able to enjoy the lit up view of the park. You can spend some leisure time in the park and enjoy the beautiful architecture.How to reach: Located in Gomti Nagar, easily accessible by public as well as private transport.Time: 11AM to 9PMEntry Fee: Rs. 10"
"This is something which make lucknow ..""Lucknow""","The people was saying that its watse of money , but the whole srrounding of it is beutiful , it represent that lucknow as a capital of U.P. nice place to spend time with your beloved or family.  I have visited manytimes .its a good place"
Not so exciting,Huge structure with a lot of elephant statue. No big park and not open to public in most of the parts. Its ok once you visit and if have less time you may drop this location from the travelling list.
A big park,"This good place for hangout ,the park is surrounded by a huge wall and there are many elephants made up of stonesThis park is made when BSP government was in UP."
Not Worth!!!,Just imagine millions of rupees spent to make park. Not worth to watch. You will not find anything except elephants made of stones. A BIG BIG NO.
Massive garden,Place is huge and has a number of concrete elephants. The park is surrounded by a huge wall. Might be a good half day visit but not more.
concrete in the middle of town - should have made a park instead,"Huge stone structure with countless stone elephants. Looks good but why not have a public park instead with trees and green grass?also, it doesn't open till 11 AM...how will someone visit a stone structure in broad daylight in Lucknow where its extreme summer for 10 months in a year?"
stone park,The stones and marbles are beautifully carved. There are fountains within the park giving spectacular view. The statue of Buddha and Ambedkarji sttaches the emotional value to it.
A visual treat..!!,"The park is a visual treat of great splendor and magnificence. In Americas and Europe, I had not seen a modern monument larger than this park. The statues are of the scale that cab be matched only in movies like Lord Of The Rings.While i appreciate this as a modern wonder, I am not sure if this was a necessary spending."
Good Architectural design in City of Nawabs,This is built over a big land and good place to visit in the evening with family and children. The big garden area and green grass gives a nice feel altogether. The kids zone can be really handy.Enjoy the evening if you are staying in Lucknow.
Good Attraction,"Very good park, properly constructed with lot of investments. Clean and peaceful. In evening musical fountain works looks very beautiful."
beautiful place for outing,"This park is near river Gomti n Gomtinagar, it is easily assessible with auto and taxi. This place is very good for roaming and enjoying."
Must visit if you are in Lucknow,It is the most beautiful public Park at Gomtinagar Lucknow. Though lots of people tell that its the wastage of money. But you can not deny of its beauty.If you visit in winter the place is really very good with family and kids.The park was tribute to by the name of Mr.B.R.Ambedkar.It is full of White marble used at any where in the park.The park is well maintain and good for passing the time with family and kids.
Big One,"The park is full of marbles, very good time to visit during winter and in the evening of summer. You can spend a quality time along with your family."
Amazing!!,"This park is near river Gomti n Gomtinagar, it is easily assessible with auto and taxi. This place is very good for roaming and enjoying."
Not Bad,"Good park to visit in the evening, but should not go at noon in summer, if you have free time then you can visit this park.."
A good monument in the vicinity of Lucknow,The palce is very good finished with marble and granite. It is a pride of Lucknow. But in summer the place becomes hot sea of marble hence not advice to visit in day time.
Not worth visiting this place...,All you can see is the plain land with marbles and elephant statues around. Seems like you are walking and walking but you could barely something different. High points goes to the cleanliness and maintenance of the park.
Historic monument,I like the place if you love to see good infra. Its pride of lucknow. Very spacious n clean monuments. Pritty big but u need some time to spend their.
Nice place to visit but in Evening,It is good for family outing in evening.It is very huge and beautiful park with marbles spread all over the area.Sunset time is the best time for visiting.
Best place to kill a evening with family in Lucknow,"Its a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is more formally known as Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal. Amazing lovely and great value of time. If you want to feel different and you have short time you should go. Beautiful place to visit. and the place in kept very clean and tidy and this is one of the best place to visit in Lucknow."
"Too huge space, very little greenery...","The first question that came to my mind when I visited this place, was...why create this? Its a huge, almost gigantic open space, with concrete floor...with some structures and statues scattered here and there and very little greenery. I would have appreciated this place more (from an evening out perspective) if it would have been a park or had grass for sitting and relaxing. Ok for one time visit but can be avoided."
A SITE TOTALLY OVERLOOKED.....,"When you think of grand places, it's the ""Taj Mahal"" in India, the ""Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Arch"" in Taipei, Taiwan and the ""Tianaman square"" in Beijing that comes to mind.  What an incredible shame that the ""Dr. Ambedkar Park"" in the city of Lucknow, India has been so overlooked...  It rates just as high as the three aforementioned places (with the exception of the ""love story"" of the Taj Mahal.)    The Dr. Ambedkar site is enormous in size and the memorial buildings there are ""so"" impressive.  I was so taken by the place, with it's arch of more than half a kilometer long lines of elephant statues and a marble colonnade that's reminiscent of ancient Rome. Dr. Ambedkar was the founder of the Indian constitution, written after India's independence from Great Britain... It's grand whether you go there by day or at night with all the projector lights illuminating this gigantic area . So impressive altogether that I later told family and friends, that a trip to India would be worth the time and money, to see just that one sight only.  DO NOT MISS IT......."
Beautiful Park,This is one of the most beautiful monuments in the Ambedkar park series. The stones and marbles are beautifully carved. There are fountains within the park giving spectacular view. The statue of Buddha and Ambedkarji sttaches the emotional value to it.
very nice place  for family,recently made.very nice clean place for family outing and picnic. near gomti river. very popular with locals and tourists
Park made of stones,"Although the park is beautifully constructed, but actually there is not much greenery to see. It's made up of pink stones which increase the temperature of the area in summers. It adds to the beauty of gomtinagar ,but I feel it is not worth visiting."
Architectural Grandeur,"This is architectural park,there is nothing you find special about these park.This place is huge open space just a replicas  of great Indian leaders.If you're a historian  just do visit.And remember clock in the late dusk, you can get see some good lighting falling over the idols and statutes."
Wastage of poor man's money,"if you want to see the wastage of poor man's money, then you must visit this place.  the useless statues of elephants and the dalit supremo Mayawati's statue etc...... all these show how our leaders waste the national wealth to enhance their own image. during the hot season, the whole area becomes a furnace and you will be boiled like a potato.more over there is no eating joint inside this complex."
grand structure but seems like a waste of Public money !!,The structure is grand and very well built.. however there are no signages to tell you what to see and the importance of what one is seeing..
GREAT STONE WORLD,"lucknow is the capital of uttar pradesh, and popularly known as nawabo ka sahar. lucknow has become a most beautiful cities in india for tourist and all people who wants to see new thing. dr. bheemrao ambedkar park is one of the place and huge place in lucknow. this place is splendid for lovers of stone, former chief minister mayawati has inargurated in its tenure. this place is one of the biggest place in lucknow district. and all types of vahicle comes here. auto, bus, tempo and rickshaw is available for this place. if i say that this is not park this is only stone world or stone home. because this place is made by only stone and tiles. so i have request you to visitors that don,t come here in april, may, june and july month. if you wish to come here come only october, november or december month.take 11 number bus for ambedkar park if you are coming from charbagh station. or take auto and say 1090 woman power line place.come and enjoy with your family."
Grand.,The place is grand and beautiful but one must have a water bottle because drinking water is a problem inside.
Worth A Look Around,"This park is one of several parks which have sprung up in Lucknow over the years. Dedicated to the memory of the architect of the Indian Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, it is a nicely landscaped walk, full of symbolism of a political party which governs the state every so often. I love the stone decor, the stone elephants and the unusual, quirky design. It;s a must see for both visitors and residents of Lucknow. Some may argue that it's a waste of taxpayers' money and they're certainly entitled to their opinion. But it must have provided employment for some in the building stage. And there's something peaceful and nice about the atmosphere here. Well worth a look around, one can spend a nice, tranquil afternoon here - or maybe early evening during the hot season, when the weather is cooler."
