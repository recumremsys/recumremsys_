Great place,"Amazing gardens and area in general.Being an ex Victorian, comparisons between both South Banks was inevitable. Got to say not even close...Brisbane and the gardens, the pool/swimming...just excels.Well done Brisvegas"
Best place to relax!,check this place especially at night lovely man made beach and load of grassy areas to just sit and enjoy the Scenes such a universal place highly recommended
Pleasant Outing,Enjoy hassle free bus travel  to your stop and roam the parklands enjoying the outdoors and  cheap family fun atmosphere .
Excellent place to spend a few hours,We have been coming here a few times a week while waiting to pick up a patient from a nearby hospital. There’s so much to see and do. Love sitting watching the river or walking the path along the river
The veggie garden!!!,There was a lovely veggie garden there that was well established. You can buy the produce during the day. It was lovely to wander through the park after dinner. Would recommend.
Just go there!,"A beautiful cobination of gardens, water features and local wildlife. Well maintained, clean and just amazing.A short walk out of the CBD, or 1 stop on the train from the city.Enjoyed a pleasant sunny Sunday afternoon strole around the grounds."
Great family activity,"Great few hours spent walking through the various parts. Had two young boys (age 6 and 5), and they had a great time looking at the different activities and attractions.Excellent free activity and kept everyone entertained."
Worth a look,"So clean,wide open spaces,water was clean,lovely walking paths nice eateries,beautiful  views of river,gardens are well maintained"
Well kept family space.,What a surprise to walk along this parkland.  So well planned and maintained.  Watched many small children with their parents enjoying the safe water areas.  A jewel in Brisbane's crown.
The Main Attraction The Wheel Not Operating.,"During our 2 wk holiday in Brisbane from Cairns we spend a considerable amount of time exploring South Bank Area, some new construction work going on & unfortunately the Brisbane Channel 7 Wheel wasn't operating. Many Cafe's Restaurants open for all tastes & budget. Overall a beautiful area to explore for all ages."
Beautifull well kept family friendly and clean spaces,"One of the great spots to spend time and appreciate the beauty of the southbank parkland area. Great places to eat, great vibe and safe"
Under construction ,Not much to do at the moment- it felt the whole place was under construction. We walked over and almost straight away walked back to the main CBD. The only place that appeared to be doing a decent trade was the Plough Inn.
Such a great day out,South bank is a must to visit when in brisbane. Amazing park for the kids and a great pool and inland beach with life guards. We spent the whole day here.
What a wonderful place!,Had a great day out here.  Brisbane is very lucky to have a place like this within walking distance from the city.
Just a get together.,"Although the weather is a bit chilly,its still a great place to walk the edge of the river and relax on the lawns."
Always nice to wander along the river but very ugly due to construction atm,Guess the government are using this Covid-19 time to to a lot of renovations but it certainly does spoil the look of the parklands atm. Quite disappointed. Such a lot of the area is closed and noisy with machinery.Luckily the view over the city from the parklands is still nice.I will be waiting at least 6 months before making a special trip here again.
It's beautiful ,If your going to Brisbane you need to go to the parklands. They are beautiful and so vast that you can relax anywhere. There is a swimming spot for the warmer months that is like a beach. They have calming music playing in some spots and even a public veggie garden.
great place to relax,"great place to relax and walk around, some amazing places to eat and drink here too with amazing views of the city really enjoy coming here, its also really safe."
Family fun,"Good space to allow children a place to play safely. It has good restaurants easy parking and well lit up at night. The park also provides a central point to access other venues such as QPAC, west end and Brisbane city."
Great place to wander round,"I really enjoyed strolling along Southbank, both during the daytime and evening. Lots of different places to eat, some gift shops and the man-made beach/lagoon. I didn't go in the lagoon itself but would aim to do this next time I'm in Brisbane."
"Relax, Unwind and Fun","One of the best places in Brisbane to relax, unwind, eat and have fun with entire family. Lot of activities for everyone including chance to get fresh organic vegetables every Thursday."
Excellent for wandering ,"The parklands are absolutely beautiful. Lovely to find some shade among the trees or to walk along the waterfront. Can get the local water transportation along there. The man made beach is a bit funny. There are people laying around in full on bikinis etc. and there was even a photo shoot one evening when I was walking by. The real beaches (ocean) which are amazing are about 45 minutes to an hour away. This beach is a huge man made beach in the parkland near the river. There is a section that is a fun water play area for younger kids. Huge climbing structure for kids. Also, cool area to hang out in giant circle hammocks. Definitely go for a stroll through if visiting Brisbane."
Loved this place,Great place to swim and hang out.  Also a nice respite from the city. Very scenic and relaxing. I’d come back.
Magical place,"This area has a park, a swimming pool, a beach, restaurants, a Cultural Centre with a Theatre, Concert Hall, an Art Gallery and the State Library. Excellent place to spend a day."
where to have lunch,"Staying in South Brisbane South Bank offers both a leisurely walk plus many, many options for lunch and dinner from cheap snack bars, fast food or good restaurants. After Covid19 is no longer an issue it will offer walks along the Brisbane River, strolll in the gardens and live entertainment."
 Brilliant oasis in the city,We loved this area of Brisbane and spent a lazy afternoon here. The pool and sandy beach are very relaxing although I imagine this can get hugely busy in high season. Plenty of bars and restaurants too and a really pleasant walk from the CBD.
Fabulous place in the City,"Beautiful park land, a man made beach and lagoon, lots of places to eat and drink a lovely walk along the riverside.Not a bit of litter anywhere a lovely place for all ages."
Great place to relax!,Lovely place! Great place to relax with street beach and bars and restaurants. Nice activities for the kids
A hightlight culture and recreation meld at Brisbane's heart,"South Bank precinct is one of the major attractions of Brisbane and one of the best urban banks worldwide.South Bank Park includes hectares of subtropical and formal gardens, laggοons, pools, waterways and a host of dining options. Enjoyable riverside walkways link to Kangaroo Point and right next door is the Cultural Center with Queensland Art Gallery and GoMA, Queensland Museum, Performing Arts Center and State Library of Queensland. The Maritime Museum, Grand Arbor and South Bank Beach are some of the nearby attractions. The south bank park is enjoyable for all ages and offers great walking, jogging and cycling routes. It is also the most beautiful and fun place for families with children, where they can play and swim on the beach and pools. The park is full off magnificent flowers, vegetation, trees, a rain forest, a pagoda and the wheel of Brisbane. Visitors will find plenty of food and drink choices here (cafe, bars, restaurants, pubs, take away) and a wonderful picnic area. A real paradise awaits you ..."
Sunny Southbank,Whether enjoying the sites of the city from the South bank cool lush gardens to lounging in a tropical lagoon. South bank has something for every one. Regular markets are held each week and a variety of entertainment can be found. Loads of food options in a variety of eaterys. Catch a ferry and travel along the Brisbane River to South Bank and have a great day out.
LOVE THIS PLACE!,Amazing time and we spent 3 different days hanging out. We sat under a big umbrella and watched the boats go by by. As well so much fun to watch the swallows fly by and dive bomb into the water.
What a wonderful place to walk through,"Lovely to walk through, really felt odd with so few people and no food fair. Plough Inn, as usual, was great"
Beautiful,"Check this place out, especially at night.The beautiful creeper lined pathway is beautiful and you can always take a dip at the beach... you have to see it to believe it."
Great place to go,"We have visited south bank a couple of times and always enjoyed the water food and surndings,market stalls on weekend also nice just walking around lots to see and do great for children."
"Beautiful, tranquil, easy to walk around","On our recent five day trip to Brisbane, we walked over the bridge to the South Bank Parklands to walk along the river.  We live in Cairns, which is beautiful, but can I just say that this area in Brisbane, the parks, walkways and river are just gorgeous.  The lagoon pool is well set out for all ages, with lovely sitting areas.  It is right on the Brisbane River overlooking the City.  There are amenities, restaurants and bars all around this area.  Spend a whole day or just a few hours but don't miss it."
Peaceful,"Lovely man made beach and loads of grassy areas to just sit and enjoy the sun.  Loads of facilities; water, toilets, bars and restaurants."
Really nice area for fun,"Impressed with the facilities and sorrounding restaurants and bars, pool, chairs, picnic BBQ spots, evening ambience as and lighting, good to stroll around and settle in one bar!"
Streets beach,"Lovely relaxing place right along the river. The water is refreshing and patrolled by Life guards. Landscaping is just perfect and you can escape the city. Great atmosphere at the eating resort and plenty of amenities like lockers, showers and  toilets. Oh and the sand is so sandy!"
Great spot,Lots to do with good eating  facilities & playgrounds & pools for the kids. Nice ambiance & access to the river ferry
Great for everyone !!!!,"Great location, great views and great Restaurants.We walked from the Sheraton across the bridge, the weather was fabulous, went for a swim, it is like a gathering of all people, had lunch at cafe near by. At night we walked down again and went to yellow fin fish restaurant.Such a universal place."
Don’t forget your bathers,"Beautiful pool facilities right next to the river. A few pools to choose from, a kids area and a beach area."
Wonderful free venue in central Brisbane for families.,"Swimming lagoons are supervised by trained lifeguards even at night, I was surprised to see. With eateries for all budgets, walking trails along the river, transport on cute little ferries, dramatic cityscape views,exciting climbing activities, market stalls, lovely vegetation and even an authentic  exotic wooden temple leftover from the old Expo. South Bank has it all."
Lovely night walks and fun sunny day swims,This is a great area for all ages. If you can come during the week it's perfect for relaxing and getting a bite to eat as you stroll down the walk along the water.On the weekends it can get very busy but it's still a great day out.Definitely worth checking out.Also while you're there check out what's on at the theater or the Gallery of modern art. There is also the Wheel of Brisbane here. You can find cheaper tickets sometimes if you look online. Worth checking it out.
Oasis in the city,"I am from Brisbane and never been prouder of my city than to walk through the beautiful parklands the gardens are so well maintained and manacured and there is plenty of wildlife and restaurants I also like the chairs they provide on the lawns , we walked from the city botanical gardens over the friendship bridge right into the gardens ,, what a treat then caught the train back from south Brisbane station,"
A must-do 🚲🛴⛴🏖🚴🏊🏊🚣‍♀️,South Bank Parklands offer excellent attractions from the huge man-made lagoon with its own sandy beach to gorgeous boardwalks through lovely tropical green lush gardens. The best way to get there is either walk through the Botanical Gardens from the CBD or catch the free city hopper ferry which runs regularly every 20 minutes from Eagle Street Pier to Southbank.
Good fun ,A lot going here with a lovely beach area and pools. Very easy to get to on the city hopper ferry. Plenty of restaurants. Museums and Brisbane eye very close. All in all a nice way to spend the day
Not just a beach but a place to explore.,"Kids can swim, adults can swim or just sit in the sun on the sand or in the shade under a tree,  or just wander through the pathways and look at the scenery, have a nice cold drink overlooking the pool, or stop at one of the many places to eat, or just get an ice cream and continue wandering.  Leave from there on a free ferry across the river or take a ferry ride up and down the river stopping where ever you like to have a look around. Sunday markets are worth a look, also a great place to see Riverfire on New Years Eve."
Beach in the City CBD,Great place to wander through tropical gardens and lovely sandy beaches right in the CBD.  Ride the Wheel of Brisbane for great city views.   Great place for families.
Serenity at South Bank,"Enjoy the time discovering your own city.Walk along the river bank or wind your way through the bougainvillea shaded paths to make acquaintance with the many events occurring at South Bank.Stop in the pathway and you get to see dragons lizards sunning on dappled paths. Herb gardens and a variety of other fruit and veges. Choose a path , stop for culinary delights or simple pleasures. While away your time and enjoy."
Every growing; ever wonderous,"With no true beach near the heart of the CBD Brisbane has compensated by creating this wonderland for young and old, where you don’t have to spend a dime to take in the beauties of the city."
Love love love Southbank,"Great eateries from cheap as chips to a higher price range. Take in a show at QPAC, check out the Museum, splash around the beach and pool or just sit at one of the many eateries enjoying a coffee or something stronger, and just relax and watch the world go by. Great place for date nights, family picnics or just enjoy a stroll along the river.If you can travel in by bus saves trying to find a park because this can be difficult especially on a Sat night. If you drive in be prepared to be patient."
Lovely to see,"Southbank parklands is a lovely place to visit; the gardens are beautiful with an archway of bright bougainvilleas growing over the top of it and beautiful gardens. There is a man-made beach that is very popular with families and walking alongside the river is lovely, particularly at night time where the city lights shine and reflect on the water."
Great place to stay cool,"With more seating available around the pools, it was a great day to cool off, and let the kids play in the water park area."
An Excellent Place for Kids and Adults Alike,"It is well presented and clean. A great place to enjoy a hot day. It also has excellent, varied eating places."
Lovely place for a day out,Took my granbabies for a day out to the Southbank Parklands. Was a lovely placed to spend the day.Will go back again.
A beach village and lagoon inside the City of Brisbane,"Excellent for both Locals and visitors.  A Swimming lagoon built for babies to adults, with lifesavers to watch for the safety of all.  Restaurants, bars, ice creams, Markets, Shops and performers.  You can spend all day here because it has everything contained in the one place only a short walk away from Brisbane City."
Perfect for a hot Brissy Day!,"An oasis in the midst of a bustling thriving city! It was pretty packed when I was there, but that didn't prevent me from taking a refreshing dip in the cool, clear, aquamarine water. Parking is expensive. Best to Uber it. Lots of cool restaurants and cafes, and small markets to browse. A lovely day out. Returning again soon."
A MUST DO when in Brisbane,"Highly Recommended - Southbank and surrounds is a MUST DO when in Brisbane. A beach in the middle of the CBD where else but QLD. The entire area is an entertainment precinct with loads of restaurants and activities from seeing a show to outdoor cinemas. Swim at the beach or BBQ/Picnic on the grass, there is plenty to explore or just sit back & relax. DO NOT MISS Southbank Parklands"
Stay cool in a cool new world city,"Everyone enjoys this place, from grandparents to grandchildren, couples, families, and solo travellers. There are three depths, toilets, changing rooms, and a whole host of cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants nearby. Lots of people bring a book and chill out on the lawns. There are always plenty of birds to watch too, and being from England I never get tired of seeing Ibis, parrots and brush turkeys. The palms, trees and flowers are a reminder we are in tropical Queensland. Just beautiful!"
Southbank is a winner for the whole family,"Beautifully maintained, well set out, with lots of options for anyone of any age.  We had a beautiful meal, and a gorgeous walk along the river and through the gardens, kids swam in the lagoon."
Fantastic place to visit,"I had friends from out of town visiting and wanted somewhere locally to go.we caught the bus to Southbank walked a short distance to Southbank so much to do the kids thought they had stuck gold first a swimming it was so hot ,they played on the sand for a while after a wonderful day we had lunch such a good choice of places then as a special treat a ride on the wheel before heading home a little sunburnt and very tired"
Excellent location for a family picnic,You can spend the whole day at Southbank and still have not seen or done everything. The swimming pool is just great for all ages.
Beautiful place,This is a very nice calm place. Reminds you of Miami a little bit. The options of the pools is really cool. They have a salt water and a chlorine one. A lot of nice restaurants along the strip and music. Great place to take family of all ages. Also great place for photos.
Boardwalk South Bank,"If time and health, take the boardwalk all the way from Kurilpa Pedestrian  Bridge to spectaculare Story Bridge, and then maybe , lunch or dinner in Chinatown. Many affordsble and good eateries."
Great food choices,Inner city casual and relaxing atmosphere. A lovely walk with plenty to see. Coffees. Ice cream or a meal with a lot of dietary options.
Fantastic,Great place to cool of in the heart of the city. It was 39°C when we went so pool was awesome. Great for all ages. Changing facilities not great. Were ok but may need more and maybe a little bigger. Worth a visit as it's free. Good day out.
Cool off on a hot day by having a swim,This area is very nice and is still undergoing an upgrade to make it better. The swimming pools are great for a swim on a hot day. Plenty of cafes and food available as well plus places to sit along the river.
Oasis,"I had never really been to South Bank Parklands until recently,wow!I had no idea how much planning has gone into this area.It’s clean,manicured full of birds I’ve never heard before. The edible garden is stunning,there are so many spots to satisfy anyone.This is outstanding Brisbane and like a massive Botanical Gardens with restaurants,bars , cafes, pools ,markets ( weekends) and space just to chill out.A must for anyone!"
Beautiful area,We always love a walk along here when in Brisbane. The area is lovely and well kept with markets over the weekend and a full row of restaurants not far away! It’s an amazing area and I love the Man made beach.
South Bank Parklands,"It is really a great idea to build a public beach and swimming poor in the city center. My family did enjoy an afternoon there. It is save and clean water pool, hard to image it is free and public. 很難得有人會在市中心規劃一個公立的沙灘與游泳池，真的很棒。我們全家在那裡渡過一整個愉快的下午。它非常安全且水質很乾淨。很難想像它是免費而且是公立的。"
Great relaxing day or Family day out,"South Bank Parklands are great for all ranges of people - Families with young children as they can swim and play in the water park, Couples to swim, go on a Ferris wheel or go have a lovely breakfast, lunch or dinner. Also for a drink - they have nice restaurants all close by and they are all great"
A Must Do,"Southbank Parklands is beautiful. Can be busy with markets, cafes and restaurants. r just chill on the lawn by the river in the serenity among the pristine gardens. A definite Must Do when visiting Brisbane"
Wonderful family day out.,If you can't  find something to do in this area there is something wrong my grandchild had the best time from the pool area to the play area.
Very nice place with an city beach,"South Bank is a very nice Place on the other Riverside from Brisbane. There you can find the art gallery, the museum, one city beach, a nice park and a lot of different places to eat or drink a coffee. You arrive South Bank via city cat or city hopper from the North Warf or by foot via the Victoria Bridge (directly on the Treseary Building)"
Excellent ,"Fabulous little spot hidden away behind main streets. Gorgeous gardens, lovely restaurants and even a little beach!"
Excellent for Family Funs and Leisure Walk,It was my third time over the last 20 years walking the South Bank and the Cliffs from Kurilpa Bridge to Story Bridge and enjoyed every bit of the leisure walk. Lots of recreation facilities and attractions along the way. The views of Brisbane CBD and bridges particular at night worth many photo shots.
Close to the CBD,Cross over  the river from the CBD via bridge or City Cat and enter the quiet gentle walkways of the South Bank. Walk amongst the cultivated herb gardens or bimble through the rainforest finally relax in a deck chair close to the lagoon. This area has been tastefully built to give a quiet area close to the CBD.
Free resource,"Excellent. Free to use. And as Brisbane doesn’t have a beach near the CBd, this is the perfect compromise without having to travel."
Streets Beach Brisbane,"‘Ello chaps!Streets Beach is a 17 hectare park located on the Bank of the Brisbane river. It is an absolutely MUST VISIT.There is green space, restaurants, and a FREE man made pool area. There is the large concrete bottom pool that draws quite the crowd in hot weather, as does the neighboring beach (sand bottom) pool There is also a small kids pool and kids water playground. It’s FREE! There are public restrooms steps away that give you a free space to change, plus lockers available for rent. It is easy to spend an entire day here, enjoying the public amenities and pool while having quick access to restrooms, lunch spots, and ice cream trucks. Overall I give Streets Beach Five Stars out of Five. It’s a MUST VISIT."
Beautiful and relaxing,"Beautiful and relaxing environment in the heart of the city !! Love the swimming pool and surrounds, terrific for family day out."
Great facilities ,Visited here with teenage Children met other family members. Lots to do with playground and 2 swimming pools. Lots of eateries and access to the Brisbane Wheel.Free wifi and great parklands.
Most Enjoyable Place for a Walk,We had a most enjoyable walk along the Southbank.  It’s a great place for families to spend their leisure time. Streets Beach is just amazing with a large swimming pool and a man made beach with plenty of Lifeguards watching out for everyone. Some great parks to visit with plenty of benches in the parks and along the riverside. A few ferry stations on the Southbank too.
All you could want,"It is like going to the beach, but so much more. There are so many eateries to choose from and two pools, with a sandy beach. Plenty for the kids to enjoy too. A great day out."
"Great walk, paddle, coffee",Lovely park within easy walk of CBD. Great views of the River. Lots of cafes and an easy walk along the riverside.
Everything for entertainment,"Lovely place, with museums , theatres , restaurants, awesome pool that has a lagoon and sand.  There is even a Ferris wheel and a pagoda in the parkland.  The City Cat stops here and it is right across from the Central business district .  A must for tourists."
Family day out,"One of my favourite places in Brisbane , we go there as a couple for meals or Sunday afternoon music on the Green and we also go with my sons family We spent a lovely day here , kids had a swim then played for ages in the playground , we then had a gorgeous meal in the Pizza restaurant followed by delicious take away ice cream while relaxing on the grass looking over the river .We had been on the big wheel earlier that month so skipped that but anyone looking for a great family day don’t miss Southbank it’s awesome"
Plenty of variety,A popular spot for the locals. A variety of eateries and pubs. The wheel is nearby as is the purpose built beach and a stopping point for the city cat to explore the river.
You Either Love it Or Hate it,"We visited South Bank several times and loved the whole area, great selection of food and bars, culture plus excellent surroundings, we went on the Brisbane Wheel and a great view and good value and we also used the Brisbane Ferries from here, I would recommend catching a Bus to Southbank as car parks are way expensive and not worth it."
Peaceful & Relaxing,"When staying in the heart of the city, the South Bank Parklands is just a short walk away, on the other side of the river.It is an extremely well maintained area, very suitable for families, or those wishing to take a leisurely stroll.There is a man made beach, plenty of lawn areas, and walking paths thru the gardens.There are also great views of the river and the city !"
Well worth it!,"Have been here several times on each visit. Love it! Great place to catch the City Cat and enjoy a scenic cruise up the Brisbane River at reasonable cost compared to the organized cruises.  Many restaurants, kiosks and a public swimming area too with lifeguards and change rooms. I especially enjoy the riverside walkway in the evenings. Benches along the way to rest up. Interesting Nepalese peace pagoda and access to the wheel of Brisbane."
A gem on the banks of the river,It’s well worth a visit from the beach 🏖 pools complete with sand and the big ferris wheel 🎡 to the rainforest walk. It was quite relaxing walking through the area taking in the surroundings.
Miss,"Great place to go for a lovely day out,lovely view of the city, lovely parkland,lots of places to chose from to have lunch or dinner"
Great place,"I really love the vibe of the place, great atmosphere. I also look forward to come here for running."
Great option to spend the day! ,"A pretty good idea for a city that has no immediate beach. A large clean pool with option for kids and grown ups, even aqua gym classes! Great idea to spend the morning under the sun, with Brisbane skyline as your view"
Looking a bit tired,We used to visit with our kids but when I took my grandson back the kids swimming area was closed (in school holiday time!!) and the rest was packed out. Unable to swim in the shade so we went to to museum instead.
A holiday at home,"Relax at the swimming pools and gardens, enjoy the eateries, soak up art at the galleries, catch a city cat."
Not to be missed,A very relaxing way to get an idea about what may be worth a visit whilst in Brisbane as there are quite a few interesting places adjacent to the river that fir that bill
Fabulous,Fabulous for everyone to visit The walks are amazing and the beach area is so attractive plus suitable for any age.Lots of nice little cafes and bars plus easy access to theatres etcI would highly recommend it and plan to go there more often
South Bank Parklands,Great place for picnic and swimming with young families! Cheap day out for families! Can grab an ice cream and coffee and a meal at small cost!
Fantastic experience at Southbank,"Visited Southbank for a meal, which was great and then stayed to enjoy the great surroundings of the river and the large Southbank Pool. Just such a peaceful place, this is really one of the diamonds of Brisbane."
Holiday,Great location to wander through. Grab a bit. The Brisbane eye is a great attraction. Catch a free ferry city hopper
Great place to be,My son loves south bank with many exciting features for kids and adults alike.Can do better with more food options though.
Dont miss it.,"South Bank is a great place to relax, get delicious food,stroll along the garden paths. .A nice series of swimming pools are available free of charge .It is very popular with tourists and locals who take advantage of the area to cool off.The City is minutes away,walk ,use bicycle,take the river ferries.All is available.A maritime museum is nearby and all forms of entertainment right along the river. Don,t miss South Bank Brisbane."
"Accessible, fun and relaxing.","There is something for everyone here. I love this place. It's easily accessible either with public or private transport. Lots to do, with the beach facility a wonderful attraction. There are plenty of eateries for many different palettes and budgets as well as BBQ and picnic areas. I love just strolling beside the river, watching the bird life, sitting in the shade or catching up with family and friends. A great way to spend some time in Brisbane."
Brisbane's best Family Spot,"Southbank is suitable for all sorts of visits, with its many restaurants and social things to do. The swimming area is huge and is all set on the Brisbane River. I feel it is the best thing that happened to Brisbane."
Excellent variety to please anyone,"I often take international guests to Southbank for a nice night with plenty to see, a nice walk around and so many restaurants to choose from it’s easy to accomodate anyone’s tastes. Every guest has been impressed with these grounds and the friendly atmosphere."
Amazing Beach in the City,"fabulous day out with Family, great pool with different areas and depths, plus all the convenience of shops nearby!"
All round enjoyment,I had great day strolling around Southbank before and after a show at the Lyric Theatre. Caught the City Hopper from Eagle St Pier to Southbank and wondered through the market and a festival that was on at the time. The Bouganvilea was in flower that covers the arched walkway and it was so beautiful. the gardens were so lush and green at the time and it was a lovely sunny day. lots of families were about enjoying the bike ways and picnic areas and festival. After our musical at the Lyric Theatre we walked back to the Emporium Hotel overlooking Southbank and the River and had a cocktail the rooftop bar and took in the beautiful city and river lights
The place to meet in Brisbane,"Southbank offers everything for a great day of family fun. Great food, cool water and fun atmosphere."
A lovely facility for young families,"Well done Brisbane. this is a beautuful inner city sanctuary where families can meet/play/have a picnic FOR FREE. It is safe and generally clean. There are lots of outlets nearby for food and drink, changing facilities, public transport links!!"
South Bank Parklands,Lovely place to take children . Sit around and have lunch with friends and family members. Sit back and relax.
City oasis,Southbank is perfect for a cheap day out where you can cook a bbq or take a picnic and watch the river action. Great for a swim or check out.There are some fabulous cafes and restaurants as well
So worth a visit spent every night there!,"Absolutely loved South bank parklands we didn't every evening we were in Brisbane walking through the parklands and down South Bank, we spent some of the day at the pool/beach side. Worth a visit and a lovely way to past time."
Perfect any time of year,"With space to play, a 'beach' to swim at, barbecues to use and a multitude of cafe, restaurant and food options, South Bank have something for everyone no matter what the season.Visit the markets on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for all sorts of handicrafts and specialty foods.It's also a great spot for viewing the fireworks that are set off over the river at Christmas Eve, New Years Eve and during Riverfire."
Must do in Brisbane,"Great place to pick up some handicrafts, art and clothing at the markets - Friday to Sunday. Multiple bars, restaurants and cafes. The parklands are lovely to walk around, perfect place to bring a picnic and watch the life of the river. Check out the kitchen garden to the east and the Tibetan temple to the western side. One of the best things is the man made beach and free form pools - there is also a water park for littlies. There are toilets, showers and lockers available. The large Ferris wheel is to the west. Also walking distance to the art galleries and museums. Just be warned that parking is expensive but if you park in the Arts Precinct to the western side it is cheaper at $17 per day. Better yet catch the train, citycat, free city hopper or an Uber"
river walk between two pedestrian bridges,"Crossing over the pedestrian Kurilpa Bridge to the South Bank I walked past several cultural institutions to the Parklands area, always with great views over the river to the CBD with its skyscrapers. En route I saw the Ferris Wheel, the Nepalese Peace Pagoda with its intricate woodcarvings and the Streets Beach with swimming pools and sandy beaches.It was a beautiful sunny day and a lot of people seemed to have a great time, also at the many restaurants, bars and cafés. I don't remember having seen a similiar set up, especially with the beaches, anywhere so close to a city center. For nature lovers there is a small rainforest left and I saw quite a few - for an European - interesting birds. Back to the northside I went over the also pedestrian Goodwill Bridge."
"Nice leisure area, take your swimming gear.","A lovely area on the opposite side of the river from the CBD. There is a great free man made beach which is ideal for children, lots of restaurants and art galleries along with the boat trips which are available"
Lovely walking path,"This is a lovely area of Brisbane to walk along the river bank, enjoy the parks and cultural venues and indulge in some excellent eating options in a relaxed atmosphere."
A good park with different entertainment facilities in the city heart,"There is a artificial beach in the central swimming pool, observation wheel and many restaurants in the park. It’s very suitable for family with kids going there and spend a day."
Perfect on a hot day,We took the 3 kids to the beach at Southbank. The pool is great it has a sandy beach sloping down to 1.8m deep in parts. There is lots of different pool areas but I liked the sandy bit the best. There are life guards around but supervising your kids is a must. The bathrooms near the pools were filthy so come with thongs. The toilets near the rock pond bit were the cleanest.
Great Development ,Always enjoy a walk along the river. This is such a great development of land along the Brisbane River.
Just nice,"On a warm summer's day, visiting this area seems the thing to do and the place to be, as there were countless people of all ages enjoying themselves at or by the man-made beach.Cafes and bars are handy for those building up a thirst, while the Brisbane River with its various watercraft flows past, creating an amazing environment for singles and families.A truly lovely place."
Fantastic,"Absolutely fabulous place to visit. Chill out by the beach, relax in the gardens, soak up the views, enjoy a variety of foods from a wide selection of eateries and restaurants. So close to everything the best of Brissie has to offer. Just love it!!"
Free and Safe Family Entertainment,"South Bank Parklands was a welcome change of pace and atmosphere from Brisbane's CBD shopping district. Vibrant and full of life, this amazing area offers something for every member of the family to enjoy. Kids can relax at the park or pool patrolled by the amazing lifeguards. Take a scooter or e-bike up along the river paths to immerse yourself in Brisbane's delightful river views featuring stunning locations to take photos back toward the CBD. If it's more adventure you want there are jet ski tours, kayak tours and cruises to sate all lifestyels when exploring. After you've had enough exploring, take the time to dine on the culinary treats offered up by the plethora of restaurants and bars available in and around Grey Street. There's something to suit everyone's tastes and did I mention gelato?"
"Fun place to stroll, hang out","Lots of stuff here; the pool/beach, the outdoor market on weekends, lots of cafes/restaurants, beautifully landscaped walkways. Fun way to spend the day."
A RELAXING BEAUTIFUL AREA,"Each time I stroll through Southbank, I seem to discover something new.  The man-made beach is always popular, and it's setting is just lovely and there are life guards.  There are casual eating areas abound, as well as dine in restaurants, whatever your choice happens to be.  With plenty of beautiful grassed areas, you can sit and watch the comings and goings while having a picnic lunch, and watch the boat traffic on the lovely Brisbane River."
So much to see and do,"Covers all options. Relax or energetic, heaps to see & do & eat. Great for couples, families or whoever. A definite must see in Brisbane"
Southbank,Beautiful for a stroll and even a freshen up in the pool. There are many places to sit and places to eat.
Surprises round every corner!,"So many different experiences in this magical part of Brisbane - you can enjoy the man made beach, stroll through beautifully manicured gardens and areas of rainforest, spot the water dragons along curved pathways, soak in the atmosphere of the Nepalese Peace pagoda or enjoy a coffee, meal or a drink at one of the myriad restaurants, cafes and pubs which are scattered throughout these extensive Parklands. Good for all ages, and a wonderful vantage point for fireworks if you happen to be in Brisbane at New Year or RiverFire during the Brisbane Festival annually in September."
Beautiful ,We were in Brisbane for Christmas and the south bank parklands were so festive. Also great place to sit and watch the world go by. This dome is in the park lands where you can sit watch the lights change colour in keeping with the music really lovely.
brisvegas,"not bad for a fake beach, few bandaids around and a couple of cheeky young fellas, but all in all beats swimming in the river"
Lots a great pubs and restaurants along the south shore. ,Free man made beach overlooking the river. Great spot to cool off on a hot day. Good for everyone. Lockers and showers are available.
Family Fun for Free,"Southbank Parklands offers an amazing day out with so much to see and do. You can have a fabulous family outing without spending a cent. Southbank offers free BBQ facilities, swimming, adventure playgrounds, city views, boardwalks, epicure gardens, entertainment and more. The weekend markets offer a great variety of local arts and crafts for sale. If you want to spend some money the selection of restaurants, fast food or pub style meals is great. The hardest thing you’ll have to do all day is make a decision on what to eat, where to stroll or sit and how long you’ll swim at the beach while admiring the city views."
One of the best things about Brisbane ,"If you live in Brisbane I’m so jealous you have this! I live in London and I thought our South Bank was good but this is Great!! The pools are amazing, although could do with some more shady areas! The walk is lush, the food scene is great and the atmosphere is fantastic! Don’t miss it if you’re visiting Brisbane, we spent 7 days in the city and 2 of them here we loved it so much!"
Beautiful spot,"We walked around - along the water, in the rainforest, through the arbor.  Simply lovely.  Lots of people enjoying the space.  Very scenic.  Had lunch at a Japanese restaurant."
Terrific shaded kids playground,"Lots of climbing, sliding, spinning and swinging kept 6yr old happy and active for an hour before having lunch on a timber deck under a huge tree and watching the boats on the river. Then an icecream while walking through the beautiful arbor. Lots of people around but didn't feel 'crushed'."
Visit ,Beautiful parks and gardens and great restaurants the pools are great for families and toilet and change rooms nearby as well. A great place to meet with friends and relax

A must if visiting The City,"We went here after looking through the market and shops surrounding the pool/beach area which were great. We went with a 3 and 17 year old. The 3 year old was living her best life, there is a pool area and a beach area. Its a lovely spot to relax and cool off and take a dip. It was busy but not overcrowded. There was some live music being played in a bar not far from where we were sitting which was nice. There are plenty of food and drink options for all budgets around the the area. There are also showers and toilets which did the job. I would highly recommend going here either for a quick dip or for a longer Jolly.  Especially if you don't have children the bars/Restaurants looked fab."
Family Funtimes,"Fantastic spot with kids for a walk, picnic, play and even a splash or swim. Plenty of dining and coffee options. The hire scooters are fun too."
Beautiful relaxing oasis in heart of the city!,Great place to relax meandering along the river & through the parklands & gardens. Lots of great cafes & restaurants to meet all budgets. Even a little swimming area (artificial beach) if you fancy a dip to cool off!

There are beautiful walks and bikeways, swimming at ‘the beach’, playgrounds for kids, cafes, picnic areas, Sunday markets etc. it is close to several excellent restaurants, near to the CPD, Museum, Science Museum, Art Gallery and the Performance Theatre. No matter what time of the year Or day, Southbank is worth a visit and has something for everyone. You can make a day of it or just spend a short time there but you will enjoy what it has to offer you."
Great beach for a swim and relaxation,Southbank Beach was very nice for a swim and to relax and rest by the poolside. Although a manmade beach I would highly recommend it. The best part was a café called NODO at Southbank near the manmade beach which had all gluten free food which is great if you are a coeliac or gluten intolerant. (Yummy doughnuts! Gluten free)
A nice afternoon stroll ,"If you need something to do on a budget, taking the parkland walk around the Brisbane river and under Storybridge is very relaxing and lots to see. Take the walk and bring a friend if possible"

Gorgeous Place,"We walked through twice... Wow, South Bank! You have outdone yourselves! Such a beautiful park for people to come and enjoy! Love lagoons!"
A Perfect Water Playground,"Children of all ages will love this playground. There is a toddler area with shallow waters and fun water games. There are three large pools with soft sandy shores, varying depths from knee to chest and  constant life guard patrol. There is an adventure playground with the most amazing rope climbing structure. It’s all you need for a fun filled day and it’s all free! We arrive by train, bus or ferry to avoid the hassle of parking. There is limited street parking or early bird specials (currently $17 for the day) for the underground car parks. I have been going here since my nephew was two and is now five."
Fantastic,"We go pretty regularly, gets busy on hot days and weekends but I’ve found If you go early you have the place to yourself."
Nice swim,Bad- ffs people put your phones away while swimming all you stuck ups taking photos while in the water.We don’t want our kids in the back ground of your photos.So many people doing this pissed me off Good- Great water temperature in a great spot
Fantastic ,"If you are looking for a little get away from work or somewhere to relax this can be it, as you can have a little picnic by the river or by the man made beach, which is incredible. The whole parklands is absolutely beautiful with different things to see and explore."
Beautiful Area,"This is a man-made leisure area with a small paddling pool and a larger swimming pool with a ""beach"".  Beautiful landscaping in the area, a wooden walkway through a small rain-forest, the Nepal Peace Pagoda and home of the famous Brisbane sign alongside the river.  Also the ferris wheel is located here.  A few shops and restaurants/bars/cafes.  Just a great place to stroll along the river with a good view of the CBD area."
Very poular,"Virtually always very busy, but still a great place to hang out and have a swim, food, sunbathe, socialise."
Great for Swimming & Great for Food,"One of my favourite places in Brisbane is South Bank, Grey St & Little Stanley St will definitely be a great day out for you and your family.Huge pool that attracts hundreds or people during the holidays and so many places to eat whether it's a restaurant, confectionery, ice cream and drinking.There is an outstanding lolly shop for the whole family with lots of American stuff in that you probably haven't seen before, they come up with some crazy stuff.Also a NZ Natural ice cream and sorbet place near a Subway.Bavarian Brauhaus if you want some pub grub and beers.A couple of my favourite restaurant there include Yellowfin Seafood and grill, Ahmet's & Harajuku Gyoza."
Great for tourists,"We were only here for 5 days before and after a cruise, but we were here every day. A wonderful facility easily reached from the hotels on the other side of the river. The beach and pool area was always busy but we managed to find a spot to cool down by dipping our feet in the water."
Best experience ever! ,Koala holding and Kangaroo touching was my highlight of my visit in Brisbane. The falcon and owl was also a highlight as well as all the other animals. Grest place for people with children as well as people for any age.
Southbank via City Cat,"Absolutely beautiful, hot but awesome. I was particularly taken with the edible gardens, would love a love here just to look at the specialty gardens, well done!"
"Very busy , but a great place for rest","We were there for a short swim . It’s great, there is a Swimmingpool and a sand lagoon for swimming and laying/sitting. It was Sunday , so there very many people and kids there. You have many possibilities for drinking and eating . And Great : swimming is free."
Great place for safe swimming. can get busy in school Hoildays..,as above. but great place. remember to keep and eye on your kids!!! the lifeguards are not baby sitters!!
Lovely place to relax,South bank parklands is a really nice part of Brisbane. It's great for relaxing and soaking up the Queensland sun
Awesome Day Out!!,"This place is amazing! Right on the Brisbane River amongst CBD. Wer had a great day.  Ice cream stalls and plenty of yum eateries. Life guards patrolling all areas, but very safe. So much fun for the family."
"Dad, Mum. the Kids, Aunt Agatha and Old Pops Will Love It","SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE- fancy a stroll along riverside paths with great river/city views and plenty of shaded seating to take off the load?- maybe some time at a free 170m long twin pool area along with sizeable beach zones (lifeguards/change sheds of course)?- does exploring or relaxing at several rainforest zones appeal? Or strolling thru the one km long ARBOUR? - or maybe riding a big ferirs wheel?- are historic things your jam? The abutments of the old Victoria Bridge are well preserved and notated at the north end of this 1km long strip of greenery and the MARITIME MUSEUM at the south end has no shortage of old boats and stuff.- picnic time? Lotsa grassed areas to spread out a blanket and don the old feed bag. Plenty of free BBQ grills.-free kids and adult entertainment – some regular, some special events.- some overseas culture? - the Nepalese Pogoda will be of interest- or maybe something in the adjacent precinct – an art gallery, exhibition centre, cultural centre, high end hotels, some trendy streets with dining, take-away, shopping yada.TIPS- I accessed from the city via the latest version of the VICTORIA BRIDGE but it is possible to come in by ferry or by bus (the adjacent precinct has bus stations). No doubt that area has parking and I saw a few bicycle racks within the parklands. Online sites will  have fuller access info.- there are 3 ferry piers for SOUTH BANK – each for a different ferry service. I used the 3rd most southern where the free CITY HOPPER ferry calls, to exit. The MARITIME MUSEUM also has a stop.SUM UP – this is a good one, an area where a person, couple or family could spend most of the day at minimal or even no cost."
Lots to do,"Relaxing,  lots of food choices and drinking establishments,  pools,  man made beach,  play grounds. Really well maintained."
A must see!,"This park is so incredible, you must see it! Outdoor swimming and water park, open to the public and free. Lots of restaurants and great views. I was there for New Year’s Eve alone and I met so many cool people from all over the world and had a wonderful New Years. The fireworks were lovely."
Love this place!,"This place is in many ways the beating heart of Brisbane. I love it! You can walk for miles, swim, ride, skate, sit and eat-oh and shop! What’s not to love? Recently here and wandered and ate and took selfies and people watched, was a perfect spot to do as little or as much as you want!"
Fantastic Family Day,We spent the afternoon swimming. My grandson loved it as did his parents. Such a great venue for a cheap family experience.
Great fun as always ,"We spent 3 days in Brisbane and each day we spent some time in the South Bank Parklands. The parklands are beautiful and well looked after. We enjoyed swimming in the pools,  the great park for children, walking around, eating at near by restaurants, shopping in the little market and going on the free boat that goes up the river from the parklands. The parklands are a short walk from the museum, art galleries and the State library.... all wonderful to go to with children. Definitely recommend taking children of all ages here."
excellent ,"before Christmas it is just perfect decorated. I loved the various music events, the market and the fireworks. To stay there with family and friends is not only reduced to those days, but all year round. a place to meet people from all over the world."
Very enjoyable.,We were here midweek and therefore it was not too busy. It is a very enjoyable place to visit and the restaurants offer a variety of foods. Would visit again
City beach excellent for kids,"Even though crowded at Christmas, it was still ideal for kids to cool off. Parking underneath. Well planned different depths."
Bring your cossies!,"I was amazed at the fantastic swimming pools that are at Southbank. The weather was on the hot side so it was crowded and I didn't have swimmers, but I very much wished I did. Looked very clean, some pools are geared to kids/infants, children and adults. Coffee and eateries are close by but pricey."
Fun times but can be crowded,Such a great place but avoid the holidays. A weekday when School is on is a good time to go. Avoid the crowds and have a drink at the nearby bar
Beach in a city! Yep! and so much more...,"Right in the heart of Brisbane City is this well-designed family area, with a supervised beach, swimming lagoon, play areas, gardens, walks and eateries all along the banks of Brisbane river. You can easily spend the day here walking, swimming, take a city cat on the water, explore all the nearby museums and art galleries and choose from a plethora of eateries. It is beautiful at night too with the city lights shining onto the water. There is also QPAC centre, live music at nearby restaurants, markets, a cinema, and tons more. I love the Mexican a street back and near the Brisbane wheel. Check out the tourist info centre for more details and any special events happening in the open amphitheatre in South Bank. The only drawback is it does get busy but there is always somewhere to lounge around and watch the sights of the river and city."
"What a beautiful park, in the city, by the river.","We spent a day here exploring the park. A great escape from the city. Beautiful landscaping, green everywhere. Great for all ages. Large ferris wheel, looks like you could see the whole city from the top. There is a man made sand beach with a sand bottom pool along with a typical pool. Both with lifeguards. Plenty of spots to grab a snack or drink. The park is located right along the Brisbane river. Truly a gem."
South bank parklands,"I really enjoyed the walk and the scenery, something different. A must visit place in Brisbane, recommended !"
Amazinly lush considering the drought,"We had a beer at the Plough and were pleasantly surprised at how green, clean and well maintained everything was.There were lots of people around cooling off but it still felt uncrowded and quiet."
Great vibey place,Great vibey place with lots of food and entertainment options for adults and kids. Even in Christmas Day it seemed to be the only place that had open restaurants and cinemas. Well recommended
love ths place,I always enjoy wandering through these parklands. The highlight for me is the urban beach - this is such an asset for Brisbane. And it's free to use (other than the lockers for clothing and belonging).
Nice,"Good spot to spend a day or evening.Enough options available for food.Nice pool, beautiful gardens.Small fireworks display 2 nights in a row.Ideal for families and friends"
Last minute visit to the city,"Made a last minute visit to South Bank & had a great time. Parking limited in the area, so had to pay for parking. $20 for almost 3hrs wasn’t too bad, considering. Christmas markets were on. The chlorine smell from the pool was a bit strong (but understandable). Beautiful night & ambience for a stroll through the parklands."
Beautiful spot,"We really enjoyed walking through South Bank Parklands with our kids!! It’s so pretty and clean, so well maintained!!!"

SOUTHBANK Brisbane great family place,"Went to Southbank,  we swam,  ate lunch,  had ice cream,  had another swim and left after 5hrs of a great day out.  Great location,  great for everyone of all ages .. Must visit Southbank,  so much to see,  do and eat!"
Beach man made,"For free attraction this is worth going if you stay at Brisbane. You also can see mini stadium, history pact with neighborhood country such as Japan, and so on. 1 hours  maximum if you sight seeing only"
Just a Great use of Space..,"Great to see this wonderful facility fully utilised by the people of Brisbane and tourists alike. Plenty of spaces to rest and relax, cool pools, restaurants and eateries..if anything just need to remember to keep the toilets a bit cleaner."
Good place to cool off,Nice and clean great game utilities and perfect for families to cool off. It also has excellent views of the city. Just protect your valuables
Weekend visit to SouthBank,If you want something a bit different then bring your kids to the beach/pool at Southbank. There is a great shallow wading pool with water fountains and tipping plates or for the slightly older toddler a huge pool. All this with the backdrop of the city landscape.
Beautiful Place to Meander,"This is a lovely precinct of Brisbane, and def worth seeing if you are visiting.  Whether it is a day swimming at the 'beaches' and having ice creams or an after dinner stroll and hot chocolate, this area has everything you need.  Located very close (walking distance) to the city centre, it also is the area that has the Performing Arts Complex (QPAC) as well as Museum etc.  Well worth a a visit."
South bank,"Excellent place to come full of nice bars and places to eat. There are outdoor pools for both children and adults and lockers available too. There is a small man made beach and it is a fantastic recreational area. The maritime museum is nearby and also The Queensland museum which we really enjoyed.

"A ""must do""","South Bank Parklands is a ""must do"" when in Brisbane, beautiful park and ""Streets Beach"" right in the city... Awesome!  Easy access with the free... yes free City Hopper Ferry.  Open 07:00 - Midnight and it is free!"
The Beach in the Middle of the City,This is a great place to go on a hot day. It's just like being at the beach. Beautiful pools and sand. Lots of space to spread out and enjoy yourselves. It's a great place for kids also. Since it's right along the river you can easily get there via the ferries.
Beautiful place to stroll,"Love the parklands , safe and beautiful and love spotting the lizards and the wild turkeys. The beach and swimming area is lovely. Great range of restaurants"
Excellent facilities,"Excellent facilities with cafes, pools, playgrounds & a very happy atmosphere.  Even if you don't want to use the pools the walk along by the river is lovely."
Surprisingly good,We had heard about the South Bank Park land so decided it was worth a visit.  We weren't prepared for how big the man made beach area is.  Lots of people were taking advantage of the beaches and pools.  It is a very welcome area as only place that is available outside for public to swim and provides areas for all members of the family.
"Streets beach, Epicurius, Wheel of Brisbane, Brisbane sign, CityCat deck, everything in one place!","Southbank Parklands is an amazing site for all family. Great outdoor attraction, free and designed for all ages. Visit Streets beach on a hot day, and then head to Flowstate to experience amazing surround relaxing music to end the day. Take a pic at Brisbane sign and check the city from up high at the Wheel of Brisbane (paid). If you're feeling inspired, go watch a play at Queensland Arts Performance Centre, and then enjoy a beautiful dinner in one of the restaurants around Southbank Parklands. Its a must-do!"
"Great spot to walk, view, relax and more.","Spent the whole afternoon there yesterday. We had no togs - bugger. Heaps to do and see. Walk around, swim, relax. Plus get an ice cream. A Brisbane must do!"
A joy to relax and watch the passing parade.,"Following a lunchtime function at QPAC we decided to just wonder around and enjoy our city from Southbank. It was wonderful to sit for a while to observe the river traffic as well as the pedestrian traffic and finish with bite to eat in Grey Street. So beautiful, we love this city."
TAKE A BREAK IN THE INNER CITY,"Travelled to Southbank for a very restful afternoon, plenty of open spaces, large beach area fully supervised, coffee shop and many small eateries available. Don’t take a watch and just vege out. You will come back so refreshed. Southbank markets always worthwhile to visit when on."
Lots to do ...,"Gardens, big wheel, pools, wharf, art galleries, eateries, markets ... something for everyone.I especially loved the arbours in South Bank and Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) to the north of South BankClose to the city using the Victoria Bridge, but even better if you walk up to the Kirilpa Pedestrian bridge. Fantastic views of the city"
Hot and heavy,Liked the beach trouble was so did everyone else too over loved band aid riddled water and bodies everywhere.Expect a few code yellows too far too dirty.Public toilets need a good hose out all full of paper and wet.Cleanliness a big deterant.Cafes a tad dirty too and market full of Shenzhen tat.
Brilliant,Fantastic. What a wonderful family place. Take the kids for a swim in the pools. Then have a bite to eat (but watch out for the lolly shop - it's a trap - great selection of lollies though!!

Nice area for walking through,"Beautiful gardens and area to walk through, along the riverfront.  Very comfortable and easy to walk through."
Great space and beautiful,The South Bank Parklands area is absolutely spectacular! I started the day by taking a 5 km run along the foreshore. It was buzzing with people out exercising and enjoying the space. We then came back later with my two boys (5 and 2). They loved the playground and it catered for many different age groups. The swimming area was fantastic. Great for many different levels of swimmers. We had lunch in this area and just generally walked around. We were so impressed with the different areas and how they all aesthetically fit into the space. There was a lot of green space which I think is so important in cities. The restaurants were many and varied. Overall it was a great area that caters for many needs.
Beautiful spot in the centre of Brisbane,Lovely spot for a walk along the river with the forest area and the amazing beach and water play.  Well maintained and the arbor walk is wonderful. Walking under the shade on a very hot day was quite pleasant.  Can't wait to return with my family to spend the day splashing away.  Highly recommend a visit.
Brisbane weekend,Absolutely beautiful area filled with a variety of eateries.  The park is well maintained and the swimming area is delightful.
GOOD STOP FOR FAMILY,"Our group of 6 adults and 2 kids from Singapore took a taxi from the cruise terminal to Southbank parklands.We enjoyed the rainforest green,ferris wheel and the southbank piazza. The kids had the aquativity poolside to enjoy."
Brilliant ,In the middle of the city you get a beachside experience which is superb. It’s a safe environment for children but also has lifeguards present. The area is adjacent to bars and restaurants along with a market on Saturday.
Surprising,Visited here with our Brisbane Greeter on our tour.  The way the South Bank was developed after Expo 88 is really beautiful and seems very successful.The beach area is unexpected and so inviting.  I wish I had time to swim or had my grandchildren with me.
Wonderful place to hang out,This place is a real gem. Lots of really interesting corners to explore and the beach area with the pools are amazing - lots of different bits to them - a real asset for Brisbane.

It is a wonderful place to just walk around, enjoy the beach area on a hot day, use the kids area where they can enjoy the water area (partly shaded) or enjoy the markets or eating places - it has something for everyone.  It is a place to be enjoyed day and/or night and it is very safe.

Checkout ""whats on at Southbank"" for more."
Family Fun,"We had breakfast at Next Door Cafe in South Bank (excellent) then wandered around the South Bank Parkland what a great place for families of all ages. The beach, entertainment, markets, cafes or just wander amongst the gardens.  Sit and watch the Brisbane River traffic always interesting and relaxing Look forward to visiting again."
Avoid weekend!,During the weekend it feels like really active but little bit crowded so if you reallu need a relax just avoid and go to the end of south bank - around ferry 3 station. You can find a very peaceful area!
Always Beautiful ,"This place never disappoints, always beautiful. On a 35 degree day, the beach area was packed with people enjoying the sun and water. The markets are always great!"

You can:- Walk, ride a bike, skate or Segway along the Brisbane river- Have a picnic at one of the many grassy areas or use a free BBQ Zane gazebo- Go to one of many playgrounds for kids- Swim at the fake beach or in the chlorinated rock pool next to it- Use the kids water playground- Dine in one of the many cafes or restaurants that are scattered throughout and close by to Southbank- Take some great selfies under the long archway that is covered by bougainvillea flowers- Enjoy live music at various locations- Be entertained by buskers (music, singing, acrobatics, magicians, dancers etc)- Get some shopping done- Visit the weekend Markets/Night Markets- Take a ride on a CityCat (big, fast boats that are a water taxi service but also just fun to have a cruise around on to see the sights or to visit nearby locations along Brisbane River (like Newfarm Park or the Kangaroo Point Cliffs)- See a show at QPAC (Queensland Performing Arts Centre)- Check out the museum (at the moment there is usually love music there on Friday nights ‘on the green’ which is a grassy area in one of the courtyards)- Take a ride on the Wheel of Brisbane (basically a giant Ferris wheel with enclosed, air conditioned carriages).So there are LOTS of things to do all around Southbank and it’s kind of a must see if you visit Brisbane."
Have a nice time at a pool place you will really enjoy,"Clean and well prepaired pool. Usable for adults until children. Pool is a safe place,  with live saving guard at two points at the pool verges. I have visited twice at two days. Toilets and showers could be cleaner."
What a great place,"During a couple of days in Brisbane, my wife and I visited Southbank during the day, at night and took a river cruise from there to Breakfast Creek Point and back. They have certainly done a great job doing the Southbank area up and it is now a fantastic place to stroll leisurely, find fine dining or a cheaper eats, have a swim on a hot day or night or take in the sights whilst riding the Wheel of Brisbane which reminds me of the Eye in London. Overall, the Southbank is well recommended  and is very close to the city centre."
Still great place to visit,Babe back here for the day and really enjoyed it. There is plenty to do and see. Well worth a look!!
South Bank Brisbane,"This place is awesome. Beautifully done landscaped riverside park area. Ride the Gondola wheel, stroll the gardens or relax on the grass river bank. Theres even a swimming pool to cool off. Fantastic family location. Adjacent to the park are many quality restaurants and eating places."

Great place to walk and cycle,"Great river and city views with rock climbing an option at nearby Kangaroo Point. Accessible by public transport, adequate of extensive car parking underground. A lot of people about in the evenings too, which is nice."
This is the place to be on a Hot day,Hot summer days. A great spot for a swim. The water is probably the best quality in Australia. And there is a lot of food options as well.
River Fire,Fantastic venue. Plenty of opportunity to find good & drinks then meet friends to watch the fireworks from one of the hundreds of vantage points.Transport to & from is well organised. The security for the precinct was well thought out & respectfully engaged.I'll be back next year.
Southbank,Its nice day out but too busy. Easy public transport. Public parking is very expensive so take a bus. The city cat is a nice free way to cross over to the gardens.
For 2 hrs,It is a lovely area with nature by way of birds and lizards (Water Dragon?). The Bouganvillea all flowering and deckchairs to sit in and chat with friends.
Must see in brisbane,"what can't you like about Brisbane Southbank Parklands, If you are a visitor to Brisbane then you must get down to southbank and see for yourself how wonderful this place really is.

This is an amazing and relaxing spot for visitors who can also bring your on picnic or use the barbeques provided."
World class views while dining,Southbank Parklands on the Brisbane River has something for absolutely everyone. After wandering east through the bougainvillea -covered walkway we made our way down to the beautiful grassed area and sat to watch the city light up as it got dark. Then dinner up behind the lawn at River Quays. Delicious seafood and cold wine looking across the river lit by the city and the Story Bridge. Just beautiful!
Amazing spot in Brisbane. Cannot say you have been in Brisbane if you haven't spend time in this paradise,"From a pool to an artificial sea water pond, there is so much you can do in here. So many activities for kids, they go bananas. You can enjoy an amazing day, for the whole family, without spending a fortune. Also very special events such as Riverfire."
Nice place to visit usually crowded,"A great place to walk along the river, the pool area and picnic grounds are usually pretty packed during the summer months so plan your visit.We like to walk along the paths early evening and take photos of the water and the city, you can even hop on a free city hopper service for a bit of a cruise around. all in all it’s very pleasant but busy"
Beautiful piece of the world,"Enjoyed the parklands, street entertainers and variety of restaurants. Great place to spend the day with the kids"
Beautiful place for everyone,"South Bank is just beautiful, with plenty of things to do for all the family. There are man made beaches, water features and lots of places to sit and take in the beautiful scenery. There are also lots of places to eat, get a drink or ice cream. On the weekends there's a market along the walk way."
City Visit,We went into the city for visit and stopped in at the man made beach .. it’s enjoyable just to sit there and watch everyone run in and out of the water. I had packed a picnic for us as the food around is pretty expensive. It is nice when the sun is out but it is normally full of people. It’s worth a visit! Enjoy!
Inner City Haven,My wife and I walk to South Bank Parklands 2 to 3 ties every week.We love the exercise and the riverwalk.Such a great parkland in the heart of a City.
Very relaxing,Lots to see and do in the Parklads. Very relaxing walking by the Brisbane River and under the Arbour walkway.
4 Visits in 3 weeks,"Visiting family in Brisbane, we were advised to check out Southbank Parklands. Wow, what a place this is. Take a stroll along the Brisbane river, with its sights, views, activities and man made beach!Sat along side the river, under the views of the city skyline, is a hive of activity. A swimming pool and man made beach full of locals, tourists and visitors from all over. We came here 4 times in our 3 week visit. A great way to get some pool/beach time right in the heart of the city. Loads of local shops and bars, a huge variety of food options, meal deals, sweets, cakes and ice creams.We came back on a Saturday afternoon for the markets and the place was buzzing. Market stalls lined the central avenue, all of the bars were busy, all allowing kids in too. Live music at the plough inn and a real buzz around. Southbank by night has a real city feel to it. Great scenes, a very pleasant walk to the Brisbane sign and wheel along the river and still people in the pools at 10pm. I cant stress how good this place is. Possibly the highlight of our visit to Brisbane!"
South Bank,This area along the river bank has been very well done and a real credit to Brisbane.Extensive landscaping and paving make for a lovely walk through this area.We also went on the Brisbane Eye to get another view of the area.There are nice places to eat and drink near the Eye.  We also visited the museum which was very well set out and free to visit.We also did a Segway tour that went through the area.Well worth spending a morning visit.
A City Playground,"The red City Hopper boat docked at the South Bank 3 Ferry Terminal to unload a number of passengers bound for this part of the city. This little pier is the gateway to the playgrounds of South Brisbane. This is where the Wheel of Brisbane, the Epicurious Garden, a man-made beach sand swimming area called Street Beach and a host of galleries, a museum, a convention center and the Brisbane Sign are located. When the sun goes down take a selfie of the Brisbane Sign and get a good picture of the Brisbane Skyline in the background at night."
Nice location,I was impressed by the nice pool and beach and view. The gardens were lovely. Nice area to walk through. Was expecting shops but there were only a few restaurants really. Definitely a must see . Nice little parks also and some lizards hanging about.
don't miss it,"just across the bridge and you are in a wonderful park with lots of green, Arts Institutes, a Ferris Wheel, a beach/pool, etc , strolling along the river bank towards the Botanic Garden (Bridge)"
Relaxing in crowd,"One of ""must to visit"" places when in Brisbane. Lot of happy faces tell you about it. When you tired of walking, find you spot and enjoy people watching and beer. On your own or not, one will have a nice relaxing time. More bars and street food would suit better than chain restaurants."
Beautiful walk through flowers,I very much enjoyed this park with many restaurants and an amazing swimming pool where you can swim and see the city.  There is a long walk with tropical bright pink  flowers overhead I liked very much.
Great place to visit with children ,I visited South Bank parklands  a few times with my little grandson fabulous day out. Week days were reasonably quiet. Highly recommend this spot for anyone visiting Brisbane.
Great place to explore,"Such a fun and relaxing place to explore. Walking, the big wheel, the gardens, friendship stones, food outlets and swimming lagoon. So many choices. So much fun!"
Take 2 days at leisury pace to use all and every thing,Artistic. Lots of restaurants around. The view at night is fantastic particularly from the free ferry. You can walk across the bridges to the South Bank too.
Fantastic Facilities,"The beaches, lagoons, parklands, playgrounds and surrounding businesses create a great space for families, couples and all those in between to relax, have fun, get fit and get outdoors."
Fabulous,"This area of Brisbane is simply fabulous. There is plenty of accommodation and restaurants. The beach pool is excellent with a life guard on duty. Great places overlooking all the action to have a drink. You can even take your own picnic. Just walking along the beautiful path & having a ride on the wheel is great. If not staying in Southbank, it's an easy walk from Brisbane city, or can hire a scooter at various location. Love this layed back place. Its a must to visit if staying in Brisbane. You won't want to leave!"
Adventures and relaxation,"No matter what family members I bring to Southbank we love it! There is plenty to see, pools to swim in, a children's train ride, options for using the Citycats or taking a river cruise. There are many styles of eateries and plenty of shade. A comfortable walk across a bridge can take you to other parts of Brisbane if you wish. We always find just the right mix of adventure and relaxation at Southbank."
Wonderful wonderful wonderful,Beautiful weather.  Great selection of food and drink.  Shade.  Free pools.  This sort of area should be made.mamdatory for every city in the world.
The Best park area in Brisbane,A beautiful place to walk along the river and stop and have a drink and a bite to eat at one of the many places you can choose from along the South Bank.We spent several hours watching the boats on the river whilst hanging out in a restaurant/bar and we loved it!
Take a stroll,Lovely and lively. Plenty of youngsters and interesting landscape. I also spotted a couple of goannas and lots of ibises.
Just Great,If only other councils followed the lead of Brisbane free across river ferries for access area gorgeous.
Fantastic park area with sports and food,"This is the best area in Brisbane. Beautiful park, free pools, gym lessons, jogging routes and evening walks. Very safe to walk and spend time. Nice cafeterias and small restaurants in the park and nearby streets. Magnificent evening view to the city."
Great at night ,"Always so much atmosphere, activity and somewhere great to eat. On the evening we were there we were hit with a storm, but with all the available places to shelter and it just added to the appeal. There was some event on at the auditorium with a whole bunch of kids cheering with delight along with general hum of people getting out for the evening."
Great Man Made Beach,Super popular with restaurants and markets right there. Very busy when we visited. We didn’t swim as were there for the markets but would definitely go back next time for a swim
Love this place,We last visited here 10 years ago and it has changed since then - many more buildings and the gardens are now well established.  The gardens are lovely as is the swimming pool area - what a fantastic attraction for a city centre.  The arbours of bougainvillaea are spectacular and so lovely to walk through.  we struck a day when there was a market on which was a nice surprise - great to wander through.  Well done Brisbane on such a great city centre attraction
Simply Beautiful ,"Be such, lagoon, swimming pool, beautiful park area. What’s not to love about this place?! Just visit."
Nice sea-alike beach,"I like this place as it has different aspects mixed all together. A place by the river, has swimming pools and sand, kids friendly, Free of charge, and very close to the city centre. You can spend a full day with your kids over-there (Open from 7:00 to 7:00)."
Great place for the whole family,"The parklands at South Bank are superb.  There is so much for kids to do,  Great to see them swimming, running, playing on swings and riding bikes instead of looking at their electronics.  Very safe place for your kids to swim and it is all free! which is a bonus.  Well done Brisbane, great place!"
Great place for all ages,"Fantastic place for all ages, lots to see and do.   Easy to get round .   Plenty of place to grab a bite to eat.   Will certainly visit again"
South Bank Brisbane,"Every visitor to Brisbane should go to South Bank Parklands. There is something for all ages a beach and swimming pools, walks along the river with views across to the city, trips on the ferry cats and lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. A glorious day out for families. Plus the fabulous QPAC theatres nearby. Hands up to Brisbane!"
Relaxing and picturesque,"A beautiful spot to walk through the arbor and feel the warm breeze. Gorgeous landscaping and a variety of fauna visit. If you had children or time, the city Beach is fabulous and watched by lifeguards at night and on the weekend. Lovely spots to eat or have coffee. We all felt like moving to Brisbane."
