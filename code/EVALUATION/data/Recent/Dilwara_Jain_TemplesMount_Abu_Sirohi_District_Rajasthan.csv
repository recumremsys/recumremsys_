The word Tirthankara signifies the founder of a tirtha, which is a fordable passage across the sea of interminable births and deaths, the samsara. According to Jains, a Tirthankara is an individual who has conquered the samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth, on their own, and made a path for others to follow.  Digambara sect believes all 24 Tirthankara to be men including Mallinatha. Our Visit, We visited the temple around 12.00 noon.  Since it was February, the weather was pleasant at Mount Abu. The temple was more chilled than the outside temperature. The ambiance was peaceful and serene and gave lots of peace to mind. We spend almost an hour because every pillar and ceiling was full of carvings with so much of perfection. I lossed in thoughts of these divine artist who have crafted these beautiful carvings long back when there was no advance engineering and amenities. How must be the pure soul of such amazing artist?

Think twice when visiting in winter.. ,The review is not for the temple but the visiting rules.The temple itself is beautiful but you have to remove your footwear to enter the temple.. Won't be a problem in summer but in winter I found it unbearable to walk on the cold floor without the footwear.. had to leave it midway to get out.. The management should think about this problem to be honest.
Architectural beauty,"It is a Svetambara Jain temple where one can have sense of calmness and unique piece of art at every other end, with no repetition in any design, this place was made during Vastupala and Tejapala ministers of Vaghela dynasty in 1030 A.D.

It is a little disappointing that cameras and mobile phones are not allowed and also you cannot sit in the temples. But a must visit if you are visiting Mount Abu.

Magnificent,"Dilwara Jain Temple really a magnificent temple with mind blowing architecture, after seeing temple, it's really unimaginable that, how they made this temple, carvings at each and every corner of temple is really magnificent. We were totally mesmerized with the beauty of temple, no one is allowed to take camera inside the premises even mobile also, so not possible to take photos to save for life."
Marvel of architecture,"Dilwara temples are definitively a Marvel. The temples are neat and clean. The carvings are beautiful and very evidently a result of long and skillful effort. Some knowledge of Jain scriptures and mythology will help in understanding the carvings. Otherwise also one can enjoy the art and marvel at the skill and patience required to create such sculptures. Personally I feel that they are superior to Taj Mahal but are less well known because they have not been promoted in a similar manner. Probably that actually works in favour of the temples. Photography, revealing attire, leather articles (except belt and wallet) and footwear(obviously) are prohibited inside the temple complex. Basic amenities are very basic indeed."
One of the best specimens of architectural perfection in the country!,"Dilwara Temple: The Jain Dilwara temple complex is located 2.5 km from the Mount Abu town centre. It is a major sacred pilgrimage site for Jains worldwide and is Mount Abu's most popular attraction. The temple complex is set in beautiful surroundings of mango trees and wooded hills - a walk around the complex is worth it. The Dilwara temple predates the town of Mount Abu by several centuries and was built when this site was just a remote mountain area. The complex contains five Jain temples which are known worldwide for their superb marble carvings. Vimal Vasahi and Luna Vasahi temples are the most famous among the five Jain Dilwara temples. It is believed that the artisans were paid according to the amount of dust they collected, encouraging them to carve ever more intricately P.S.: I have no photograph of Dilwara Temple as the photography is not allowed here ????"

Superb Marble Work,Diwara Jain Temple has total 4 temples and each has very marvelous carving work on Marvel.  The temple is open for visitors from 12 to 5 only.
Ok place ,This place is overhyped for sightseeing. Nothing much interesting to see. It's only a simple temple.
Marvellous,"It is not just religious value to Dilwara Jain Temple but  it is historical value to these temples, which should not be forgotten and every Indian should experience. Carving is marvellous. Only drawback and shocking thing was Priests / Poojaris asking for money - which should be banned. It is never done in Jain Temples. Trust should look in to this matter. I am sure Jain community is financially strong enough to support welfare of such temples."
One of the beautiful jain temples in mount abu,Conglomerate of 4 beautiful main temples in marble.beautiful architecture.youdo not allow pictures inside the main temple.its worth a visit.they have poepke who take time to explain to you in batches regardibg the temple which is well organised.ladies during periods are not allowed to visit.

Architecture,I love architecture and designs alot here. One of the natural and beautiful carvings still well maintained. One take lot of inspiration from here for interiors and home decorations.
Simply amazing,"The Dilwara temples are an architectural wonder. I tell all my friends to visit this place first, even before the Taj Mahal if they are touring India. These are very old Jain temples in Mount Abu. Don't be fooled by the exterior. It was meant to dissuade marauders from attacking and destroying the temples. Once you enter the rooms you will be blown away by the hundreds of thousands of marble sculptures that adorn the walls and pillars of each room. In fact, as you walk from room to room, you will find that each room is more spectacular than the last. The details in these marble figurines are mind boggling. You can actually see the fingernails on each tiny figurine. If you have time for one spectacular attraction when you visit India, make sure this is it."
Amazing interior marble architecture,This is a very old Jain temple in Mt Abu and considerd very holy. The exterior will fool tourist as a very simple plain temple but once you are inside you will be blown away by the mazing sculptures and architecture on pillow and roof. It a must visit if you are in this vincity. They do a great job of giving a good tour explain the history to visitors.
This is the more wonderful temple of the Jain I've seen.,"The place in general has a lake, that is not extraordinary.  The road is dangerous, because is located on the mountains, very curved, with wonderful views of the landscape.   The dilwara temples, were built on the IX-X century, had more than 200 domes very nicely carved,  all of the seallings, galleries and pillars are filigrane.  It is an active temple and the religious community don't let taking photographs.  It is an example of the mixed religious concepts, Jain believes in just one god, but all the temple has hindi gods sculptures.  One of the temples is totally hindi Shiva dedicated. wonderful galleries with horses and elephants.  Hotelery is not as good as we wanted, but the trip was wonderful"
Amazing Stone Carvings,Stone carvings are beautifully done and engravings are very deep and meaningful...!! Something that depicts the great architecture of the golden era..!!
Testimony of Art and Devotion,"While the temples are a place of religious importance and have an important place for the Jain sect, they are also a testimony of how rich the art and architecture of ancient India was. Build in solid marble with such beautiful engravings and decorations that one cannot resist appreciating. The vast complex houses several temples and one must give adequate time to truly appreciate the effort taken to build these."
Amazing marble curving,It's unbelievable until you visit this wonderful temple. No mobile phone or camera is allowed inside the temple. Wear full trouser or full dress.
Pretty awesome place !,We went there in September with family. They only allow limited folks inside temple at any given time and each group that goes is assigned a guide as well that explains history of temple.  Once you are inside there are 4-5 temples that you will see. The architecture is just…
Temple visit,Worth visiting . Excellent temple . No words for the artissns who worjed 1000 years ago for such a marvel 
Beautiful architecture,"This is one place you should visit when you go to Mount Abu, as the place is beautiful and should not be missed"
Beautiful architecture,"The Jain Temple is beautiful in architecture however there is a huge wait time on occasions for tour groups and once done, you are almost ' extorted' for money as donation by many people which is kind of sad."
Architectural Marvel,"Enshrining the divinities of Jainism, this temple is nothing less than one of the finest architectural marvels of Indian workmanship. The simple outer facade of the temple belies the intricate marble carvings inside the temples, not to mention the magnificent statue made of Panchadhatu weighing north of 4 tons. The grandeur of this temple complex and spiritual ambience makes Dilwara Temples truly one of the must visit places at Mount Abu."
A holy visit,"The Five Marvels Of Dilwara TemplesThe opulent Dilwara Temple consists of five temples built over the centuries. They are-1. Vimal Vasahi Temple- Dedicated to Lord Adinath, the first Jain Tirthankar Lord, Vimal Vasahi Temple is the most famous and oldest amongst all the temples. It was built by Vimal Shah, the Solanki Maharaja of Gujarat in 1021. It has richly carved ceilings, roofs, doors and mandaps. The immaculate patterns of petals, flowers, lotuses, murals and scenes from mythology are simply awe-inspiring. Erected in an open courtyard, the temple is surrounded by a corridor which has smaller idols of the Tirthankaras. Gudh Mandap is the main hall, where the idol of Lord Adinath resides. It is believed that 1,500 masons and 1,200 labourers took 14 years to build the temple and it costs Rs 185.3 million.2. Luna Vasahi Temple- Built in 1230, Luna Vasahi Temple is dedicated to Lord Neminath, the 22nd Jain Tirthankara Lord. The second prominent temple, it was built in 1230 by two Porwad brothers namely Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of Virdhaval, in the memory of their brother Luna. The Rang Mandap is the central hall which has 72 figures of Tirthankaras in a circular band and 360 figures of Jain monks. It also has a Hathishala which houses 10 marble elephants and a giant black stone pillar called Kirthi Stambh. A Navchowki has nine delicately designed ceilings.3. Pittalhar Temple- The third temple was built by Bhima Seth and is dedicated to Lord Rishabdeo, the first Jain Tirthankara Lord. A huge statue of Lord Adinath made of five metals and brass is installed in the temple. This temple also has Garbhagraha, Gudh Mandap and a Navchowki.4. Parshwanatha Temple- A three-storeyed building and the tallest of all the temples, it was built by Mandlik as a dedication to Lord Parshavanath, the 23rd Jain Tirthankar Lord in 1459. The temple has four main halls, and the walls have remarkable carvings on grey sandstone.5. Mahavir Swami Temple- Dedicated to Lord Mahavir, the 24th Jain Tirthankara Lord, this temple is comparatively smaller but, it will fascinate you equally. Built in 1582, it boasts of several paintings from the artists of Sirohi."
Amazing carvings!,"Really enjoyed visiting here. The carvings are spectacular, and make sure you look up as the ceilings are the highlight. Guide knowledgeable, but only spoke in Hindi. A considerable hike from the town centre so take a taxi!"
Worth a visit,"There are total 4-5 temples which needs to be visited. Process: - You need to deposit your phones, belts and money bags in the locker area where they charge Rs. 5 for each thing you keep.- Then you need to put your shoes in the shoe keeping zone at the rate of Rs. 5 for each pair of shoes. - You will be asked to wait until there are lots of persons in queue to make a group. - A guide is assigned for the visit to 4-5 temples. - This guide explains you details/history of the creator, jainism and other care-takers before entering each temple. - At the end he asks you to pay any amount of money you want to pay as donation, be it Rs. 10 or 100 or 1000. - ExitOver all the temples are well crafted by the skilled labours. Operations time: 12:00 pm to 5:00/6:00 pm (for non-jains)"

Excellent Historical monument,"It was nice visiting the place. I do not know why they do not allow mobile and camera inside the monument. Non Jain people are allowed after 12 PM. You need to keep your mobile and camera in locker. The man there tries to fleece money from you and ask for more than the published rates. Same is the case with shoes and toilets. Inside the premises, so called Pandit/ Guide requests for the tips. Worth going there."

There are 5 temples in the complex, the fifth was not open when I went.

Visit to famous Jain Temple.,Dilwara Jain Temple at Mount Abu is very famous Temple among Jains and other religion Tourists. The temple has beautiful marble carvings which was made in 13th Century. There are 5 different temples with beautiful marble carvings.
First even religious locatoon that doesnt chrge entry fee,"Yes, the Dilwara temple doesn't charge any entry fee. And is still maintained as well as clean. Although, for someone who visited after 2 decades, he said that that glorious glow of the the temple has dimmed. But once can't get over the splendid craftsmanship in the temple, considering it was done centuries ago. In Mount Abu, this is just a 15-20minute bike ride and will take 30mins to complete the visit. The temple pujaris, personally explain the history and stories behind the temple's existence and take you around (also to ask for donation towards the end). No photos available to share, coz the authorities asked one and all to deposit their phones before entering the temple. This one is a strict rule."

Best place in Mount abu,"If you are in Mount Abu do not miss this place. It's beautiful, a temple tour guide (free) takes you around and explains everything and tells stories connected to the temples. The carvings on walls are amazingly symmetrical and detailed given that it was all done manually."
