Beautiful,Manikaran sahib gurdwara is an experience beyond words. You experience some other world. It really makes me wonder on how guruji travelled that far. That is why they are gurus.There is a temple just adjacent to the gurdwara.  One can visit and seek thd blessings of the almighty. A dip in the hot water stream is a medicinal blessing.  It heals and refreshes you . The noise of the river Parvati is scary. However I feel that both the temple and gurdwara should be cleaned more. One may feel a little disappointment in that context.The route to the gurdwara is extremely scary and narrow as well. I was so scared that I kept praying both ways.
Very scenic,The gurudwara is very beautiful and at a very scenic place. The only problem is is that it becomes a bit overcrowded at the entrance to the gurudhara.
Manikaran Temple,From Manali to the Manikaran Temple  was very beautiful and scenic. The interesting part is the hot spring.  Is boiling hot . The temple place the food on the boiling spring water to keep it warm and cook.
Can be avoided,"We travelled from Manali which took almost 3hrs to reach one way. Since it was a day trip, bad roads made it very hectic. The entire journey was very scenic with the snow clapped mountains, river flowing adjacent to the road. (Which is as same as the road from Manali - Chandigarh). It can be a quick visit if you r staying at Kasol or if u r very religious. Coming to the gurudwara the washrooms lacked hygiene and weren't kept up properly n clean. As have seen other Gurudwaras this one didnt seemed to be clean as otherwise gurudwaras r known for it.Overall we waited there for hardly 10mins n started are journey back to Manali hence it turned to be costly n an entire day was spent mostly travelling."
Blessings,This place is a blessing to everyone wgo visits here ..completely mesmerised by the ambience around ..
"Beautiful place, but do a full survey before you get there!","It's a lovely place, great vibes to be here. However there is just no guidance around here. So you kinda feel lost or juts follow the crowd, which may not be the best thing to do. So, we wanted to take a dip in the hot water spring. Now here there are several places to take a dip, for men and women separately. 1. Ram Mandir : Very nice place. There are rooms where in you can take the hot water bath.2. Walk till the Gurudwara : Here also, several places mention that you can take a dip  with locker facility etc 3. Once you enter the gurudwara , there are 2 indoor pools. One for men and one for women. Here,there isnt any place to store your clothes properly neither are there sufficient lights. People also end up washing their clothes / shampooing their hair etc. So not quite sure, how pure is it to take an actual dip.4. Once you move out and cross the bridg, there's a pool outdoors.So this is confusing.You dont really know which is the right pool to get into.  We went in the 3rd one, just in belief of it being a spiritual place. Hope we had people around to explain and guide us to the right place. It would then be a great experience."
Beautiful sacred place,Beautiful sacred place with hot water stream flowing parallel to river Parvati. Must visit if u traveling to Manali or kasol.
Hot water spring,Here you can experience hot water spring. Connecting road to this place is bit small and you need to be more careful while driving.
Awesome to see...and gurdwara is one of the best temple to visit along with hot spring water...,Best place feel like heaven ...Come along with families and friends to visit gurdwara and hot water...
Gurudwara-hot spring-trmple in the middle of parvati valley,"Actually most Tourist are go there via manali, you can call this a one day outskirts tour from manali, you can also go from kasol , the only problem is the road conditions are not up to the mark as it is in the top hill region,once reached you can see the gurdwara, siva temple, the hot spring and the hot cave, and the main thing is the natural beauty, belief me ,whatever religious beliefs you have that can be kept aside in respect of the natural holiness of this place.a must go place...."
Must visit if Manali in your list.,"Worship for Sikhs, famous for hot water spring with valley views, free food & lodging for travelers. The most amazing fact is that the food is being cooked using the same hot water without any fuel must-visit hardly take 2 hrs to complete this entire area to cover and there is one hot cave has a large area, where many people sit or lay down on the floor to enjoy the healing power of the heated surface. It is a perfect place to relieve the back pains or muscle aches."
Worth a visit,"I was staying in Kasol, so walked out to Manikaran one morning. Friendly stray dogs accompanied me most of the way! It was a nice easy walk, with places to stop along the way for Chai or Maggi.I didn't use the hot springs, but they seemed popular.The main downside for me was seeing all the plastic rubbish, both while walking, and on the edge of the river right in Manikaran."
good,One interesting fact is there is a hot water spring when we go through the temple  after the cave to reach Shiva temple that.Get a clear picture of the temple
Hot water spring and gurudwara,Manikaran gurudwara is a holy place and people across communities and geopgraphes visit this place. There is a hot water spring and also langar for tourists.

Not sure how the facilities will be , but beautiful road and wonderful bliss of nature specially after the rush of Manali ."
An important place for pilgrims,It is an important place for Sikh and Hindu pilgrims alike. A must do when you visiting Kullu-Manali for some. Public amenities can be improved looking at the number of people visiting.
Hot water spring  is the key attraction. Nice place to visit ,It's one of the most beautiful gurudwara temple. The hot water spring is main attraction there. In the temple hot water cave also available. You can feel relaxed in hot cave. You will not feel cold even  if you visit that temple  in winter season.
Must visit holy place while in kullu valley,We visited the holy place while on tour to Parvati valley in may 2019.It's old and famous religious place.There is large hot water spring inside the premises.U should take Prasad from langar inside the Gurudwara.Lots of sikh devotees from all over India and world visit this place so there is always rush inside the place .There is nice market by the side of Gurudwara.Overall a must visit place when u visit Parvati valley
You can skip,If you are religious you can go to this place. Otherwise nothing much. It is very far from Manali. Roads are not good. It took almost two and half hours to reach this place. Main attraction is Parvati river.
Manikaran a serene place,When in manali  a visit to manikaran is a must. It is a very serene place. There us a hot water bath there.
Must visit place in world,Its an amazing experience.I have visited in month of august.Snowfall is very less but its very cool place as it located at top of hills.Free food provided by temple.Very peacefull inside the temple.Beside lord shiva temple located.No words when i saw the my lord shiva at that place.One side river is flowing.Inside lord shiva temple hot water available

Must Visit Gurudwara,"A beautiful and Holy Place among the mountains. Hot springs, Chanting and prasad i.e. Langar really adds a different flavour to your Manali Trip. Must Visit"
Holy place,Beautiful place. Hot spring there and piligrims can have holy bath. Separate place for man and women. Free food ‘Langar’ available all the time. Stay facility also there.there are 2 temple of lord shiva and ram is situated near to it.
Too Hyped,I suggest do not make efforts of going this place unless it is on your way literally. It is a decent place with hot water spring which you can get in Manali also.
Beware ,Make sure you keep your personal belongings safe and by our side . Hygiene is ridiclous so another thing to worry about is falling prey to germs and bad bacteria . The bad smell covers the area . The management are busy minting money robbing innocent travellers .Not worthy of called a spiritual destination .
Gurudhwara,Religious place. A peaceful place which surrounds amazing. It is situated near river. Nice experience at all.
Peceful place to visiting,It is a sikh guru temple and they are very helpful to know about. It a place where we stay and know about that temple. You must visit and know about them
An unforgettable experience,This was the main reason for our visit. The holy shrine is very well managed and we ended up spending few hours here.
Spiritual place,Do buy cans to bring Amrit Jal back home. Langar is served 24*7. Rumalas and prasad from outside is not allowed.
Very good religious place,This place is approx 45km away from Kullu and 85 km frm Manali. You can reach here by private taxi or roadways bus. Local bus service is quite good in HP. Gurudwara having hot water spring.
Holy place..........,"Manikaran Gurudwara is a holy place for hindus and Sikh community, Baba Nanak and Mardana visit this place and stay for some time. It is situated on the bank of River Parwati. There is temple of ""Lord Shiva the Creator of this nature"" where you can find the hot water springs. On the high hills of Himalaya you can find the truth of life, peace and harmony. Regular transport facility, hotels and inn's are available here........go for a break and rejuvenate yourself............."
Nature/Peace,"Manikaran, one hour from kasol's chalal bridge.... manikaran is mostly famous for the flowing hot water spring... but the stuff are some costly...."
Soothing relaxing break on way to Manali.,The Gurudwara is near Kasauli. It has free food served at langar and natural hot water spring to bathe and refresh. A great break with darshan visiting Manali or leaving it.
a great place to visit,snuck in one corner of the parvati valley... a great place to visit.. enjoy the hot springs. the shiva temple is a must see.. not very many places to stay... kasol is a better place to halt.. only 3 km/s from there...
Good,"Good place to visit.Around 3+ hours from Manali.Main attraction is natural Hot Water Spring.The flow of river under the entrance bridge is extremely high and worth a watch.It's situated just under the mountains with a panoramic view around.Accommodation is also available for the pilgrims.There is a way from Gurudwara Sahib to the local market just behind. You have to cross a narrow lane to reach there, only one person can exit at a time.A famous Shiv Temple is also there.Recommend to travel in a car with working AC as the road conditions are extremely bad from Kullu to Manikarn with a traffic jam near Kasol.Taxi operators does not power on AC in hills and you have to keep the windows open if you are visiting in summers."
Special place,"Mesmerizing view of Beas river, gurdwara and temple feeled very special. Sound of river was very loud. Gurudwara is there for Langar and prayer. Shiva statue and steam allow you to experience special and worship lord shiva with the steam."
Must visit religious place near kullu,We visited Parvati valley in may 2019 and during that we visited manikarn Gurudwara.It's old and famous religious place.There is large hot water reservoir inside the premises.U should take Prasad from langar inside the Gurudwara.Lots of sikh devotees from all over India and world visit this place so there is always rush inside the place .There is nice market by the side of Gurudwara.Overall a must visit place when u visit Parvati valley.
A must visit if you are on family vacation.,"Wonderful place, which has it's historical value for both Gurudwara & temple. Hot cave & hot water spring are major attraction. If you are in Manali then do plan in your itinerary."
Historical Gurudwara located at tough accessible road but a must visit,"The Gurudwara is accessible by a single lane non-black top road. It become really tough to reach the place if there is a landslide. From parking place one has to walk almost 1 kms to reach Gurudwara.I was blessed to reach and visit this place. You will not get accommodation easily, and moreover there is no attach bath to any of the rooms as there will be hot spring sarovar where one can go and bath. A pilgrim should not be allowed to be in the sarovar for more than 5 mins as due to temperature of water one gets giddiness easily.There are some lodging and boarding options available in market area on the back side of Gurudwara.Weather will be chilled during summers in morning. Parvati river will have low level of water gushing towards other side of Gurudwara during summers.Langar will be served 24x7."
Not so good,Manali to manikaran traveling is very tiring as the roads are not in good condition...we were not very happy after reaching there as it is not well maintained... don't want to visit again.
best place must visit this place,must visit this nice place. silent area best of natural lovers and very pieceful atmosphere. stay one night and adventure life is best

Holy peaceful place,One of the holy places located in Kasol. And you'll definitely be visiting this place when you're in Kasol or the outskirts around.Hot water springs are the best tourist attraction at this place and you definitely will have to enjoy the feeling.Also langhar is the best option for some delicious food.
Must visit in your Manali trip,It is 2 hours distance from Manali and very good place to visit. You will find a hot spring and pool there that will amaze you. Dont forget to boil Chana or Rice in hot pool.
Must Visit,Holy Place and tourist who reach Manali should definitely visit here . People can experience food which they make on hot water without using fire etc.
Religious,"Ahead of Kasol Village , is this Gurudwara, hot spring waters, beautiful calm and serene.Theres one hindu temple too, a must visit."
A holy day,It was a holy day. We all visited to manikaran gurdwara.Its so peace full place.Here you also explore a nature too.Though way to manikaran was too damaged.
Mesmerizing sight of Manikaran Gurudwara !,"This holy place is 35 km from Manali, worth visiting it if you want to experience Magical hot water spring ! Though we didnt dip into the hot water spring but still it gave us a spiritual feeling ! Gurudwara is on a beautiful location . We couldnt stop taking pictures as the climate was cool and it was drizzling ! Lungar offered at Gurudwara is taken as a prashad .. Hats off to the true service givers who non stop served the devotees at the lungar .. Blessed that we could visit this place.."
Manikaran Gurudwara,"This is truly a beautiful place! You can visit this peaceful place and you will love it! The place is situated in between the mountains...the view is very beautiful. There is a hot cave inside the Gurudwara. Even in the cold weather, there is a hot water spring where you will find hot boiling water throughout the year. Visit this spiritual place to relax your mind and worship god. The place gives you positive vibes. Must visit the place to feel relaxed and peaceful."
Guru ka Langar,"After a dip in the hot springs collocated with the Gurdwara, we offered our prayers and were treated at Guru ka Langar..while the role of volunteers and sewaks is praiseworthy, the organization needs to be streamlined in terms of entry and exit, cleanliness and tidying up of areas leading to the Gurdwara..these holy places must set an example of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation"
The 'sulphur 'Gurudwara,"Manikaran, perched on the right bank of the roaring Parvati River, is situated at an altitude of 1760 m and is located about 45 kms, from Kullu, via Bhuntar, in Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh. Manikaran, a place of pilgrimage for Hindus and Sikhs, has many temples and a gurdwara. It has perfect examples of the historic temples of Lord Rama, Krishna, Vishnu (Raghunath) and goddess Bhagwati.The Ram Temple was built in pyramidal style by Raja Jagat Singh in the 17th century when the idol of Lord Rama was brought from Ayodhya. The idol was later shifted to Kullu. The temple was renovated by Raja Dilip Singh in 1889 AD. A trust is looking after the temple since 1981. The temple complex has three halls and forty rooms for the devotees to stay in. A 'Langar' (free communal food) is also served here"
Gurdwara ,"Hi, spectacular view of gurdwara beside river on parvati valley . Its take 2-3 hrs journey from manali to reach manikaran but worth exploring scenic view of the valley throughout the journey. Have hot spring sarovar on can take bath on it as its having some medicinal value on it"

Beauty not able to breathe with the volume of people ,The toilets are real dirty. Pls do something about it. The location is great and people are very friendly. Enjoy the warm and giving nature of the Sikhs...who feed good food for anyone. Beautiful culture and traditions at its best. It's a tresure in the hills...to be found. I was greatly surprised...with the sheer beauty if it's place. the hot water springs and people warmth. One request is pls keep it clean like the Golden temple.in Amristar.. It's a tresure to be preserved.
Spiritual place,"The hot springs, hot cave, Shiva temple and the Gurudwara. This is one unusual package. Both the times I went, this was not crowded. Overall the experience was very good."
The hot springs at the Gurudwara is a must visit,The gurudwara is in a very picturesque setting. The bridges cutting across the River Parvati is a sight to behold. You can see the rocks from where the hot water originates. The market around is lively and a lot of souvenir shopping options.
Hot cave,We visited this temple as part of our manali tour. We were amazed after seeing the hot cave there. You can see water boiling in and around the cave
Divine,Very serene and divine place in the midst of nowhere. Worth the trip so far. And do partake of the delicious Langar!
water flow is very awesome,"i love everything at there , specially its a very nice place in the lake of nature . water flow is very good."
Free food ,Beautiful placeFree foodFree beverages Parvati River is mesmerising Free herbal hot bath at ponds in Gurudwara

The Gurudwara food is so delicious. I have never eat that kind of food before. Loved this place and going to visit again.
Gurudwara Shri Manikaran Sahib,"Manikaran is located in the Parvati Valley on river Parvati, northeast of Bhuntar in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh. It is at an altitude of 1760 m and is located 4 km ahead of Kasol and about 35 km from Kullu.Manikaran is a pilgrimage centre for Hindus and Sikhs. The Hindus believe that Manu recreated human life in Manikaran after the flood, making it a sacred area. It has many temples and a gurudwara. There are temples of the Hindu deities Rama, Krishna, and Vishnu. The area is well known for its hot springs and its beautiful landscape.It is claimed, that even before 1905, these hot water springs, sprang with full force. Making an 11 to 14 feet high fountain. The temperature of different springs at Manikaran is 64 to 80 °C . There is no Sulfur in these springs.Food is cooked in these springs.Bathing here is known as a balm for arthritis.Opening Closing Time05:00 am – 12:00 pm04:00 pm – 09:00 pmOpen all daysEntrance Free"
Worship place of pilgrimage for Hindus and Sikhs,Amazing feeling once you visit here. Very neat and clean . VYAS river is on full flow. Very well maintained. Some construction is going on . Hot caves in the gurudwara has a different feeling which gives you an internal feeling. In the adjoining Shiv temple one can see the Hot Water kund where devotees cook the rice
An amazing experience at Manikaran Gurudwara,"An experience in itself to visit the Manikaran Gurudwara is really amazing ! Enjoy the vibe there, explore the area around. Also, Manikaran hot spring water is said to heal a lot of skin diseases too. Feel free to have a bath in that."
Amazed to see the boiling water spring,Took about two hours to reach manikaran from manali. Road was very annoying but picturious. Amazed to see hot water at over 100 degree celcious. Many spot of hot water there even in the parvati river.
Beautiful Gurudwara ,Situated in the foothills at manali the manikaran gurudwara is one the places to visit. Known for its hot spring water bath and peaceful experience get immersed in the blessings of the place.
Must visit place along with kasol,"If you visiting kasol than must visit manikaran saheb . it's just 4 km form kasol and easily reached by bus . Manikaran saheb offer free stay  for family ,  must have  food at lungar .Must do thing in manikaran is take holy bath at hot water spring at gurudwara . It's really wonderful experience."
Very nice temple,"Manikaran sahib is truly a beautiful place you can take a bath in hot spring. Lungar was amazing, Must vist"
Divine Place,I rented a bike from Manali to visit Maikaran. Awesome ride and amazing views of Beas river and mountains on the way to Manikaran. This place was divine and worth visiting. It was unbelievable to witness the hot water pond right next to free flowing cold river. It's worth visiting and experience this place. One belief in god and it's creation would be stronger after visiting this place.
Visit of Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib in January 2019.,I went to Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib in January 2019. We saw light snowfall there. Gurudwara provides free Langar (food) to the shrines visiting the Gurudwara Sahib. They also provides accomodation facilities free of cost. Although if u wish to have hotel like facilities I would suggest to stay at some nearby hotels or resort which are very cheap after mid january till march end. Bath in natural Hot springs was something like lifetime experience although the water is really hot and u cannot bear it for more time. Manikaran is 40 km from Bhuntar but visit to this place is must specially if u have your own vehicle. Road is really narrow but in fairly good condition. Only precaution is not to drive fast..be patient till you reach your destination. Never forget to bring heavy woolens and never try to overtake vehicles on the way to manikaran. Enjoy....
A hidden gem near Kasol !!!,"This place has to be in everyone's bucket list if you are visiting Manali or Kasol. Just 4 kms away from the beautiful Kasol village, a Gurudwara that attracts everyone towards its hot springs. View of the parvati valley on one side and parvati river flowing underneath the Gurudwara just adds to the beauty of this place. Plus a visit to Gurudwara always brings peace to you. I even had my first ever Langar which was really nice. The best part of our visit was that it was drizzling when we reached there and what else do you require more to enjoy this wonderful place."
Nice but crowded,Go here if you are already in kasol. The gurudwara tends to get very crowded and is a bit dirty here and there.
Very beautifull,Guys you must visit and enjoy over there Men 's washroom its okLadies washroom as my wife told me you will puke
Must visit if you got extra time,This is my second visit to Manikaran and must say the place has got too commercial. Especially Kasol! You could have your food at lungars as there are no much options available. There are few hotels near the bus stand. We had our lunch at THE HIMALAYAN VILLAGE” and the food over here is mind blowing and you could also tour the property! This is quite expensive but worth it!
Hara Hara Mhadev,A place MUST visit if your in Manali. What is so Great Than God realization. A moment for YOUR INNER PEACE AND TO REALISE YOUR TRUTH. Just carry your body there and keep quiet. Thats all....
Dont miss the bath in Hotwater Spring,"Gurudwara is better known for a hot water spring. If you go there, never ever forget to take a bath from there. Its completely divine."
Interesting springs,The geo thermal springs were a wonder to view.The hot vapour rising above the icy waters of the river Parvati was amazing.However it was a little too crowded and dirty for comfort.The drive there from Kullu was beautiful though.
Must visit ,"This is a must visit place of worship.You will be surprised to see pictures of deities in and outside the main Gurudwara hall which i have never seen anywhere. You can try the hot cave post the darshan, where you can sit a while and enjoy the heat generated by sulphur springs which give you immediate relief from cold temperatures. Langar is continuously served and rice is cooked in the pots placed within the sulphur springs. You can do sewa by serving langar to others before you yourself have it if you like.Do visit and it would be a memorable experience for a lifetime."
Gurudwara,"Very nice and peaceful place, located away from Kullu. It was too cold outside the Gurudwara but inside it is warm and comfortable."
Manikaran Gurudwara,"Manikaran Gurudwara is in kullu , very beautiful gurudwara with awesome view , hot water kund are there for mens and womens as well."
Nice place to see Nature and greenery ,"When we get of from car it was freezing out there, but when we enter in gurudwara you won’t believe that difference in temperature between breeze and when you enter in gurudwara.And don’t forget to try natural heated pool and the lunger in Gurudwara! Natural heated pool really help to heal yourself from stress and any skin disease! There was a lord shiva temple also behind the Gurudwara you can see small natural heated pool there also. But in travelling way to Manikaran it really Scary and Dangerous due to bad constructed tiny roads! Himachal government should work on those road! Size may not but at least well maintained road."
Gurudwara,Very nice and quite place Hot water spring bath is very relaxingMust visit place for every oneDont forget to take part in lunger
Nice Place to Visit,The gurudwara is small on the Holi river Bias. There is a small bridge neat this place to reach to Manali.
nice place,very very good place and hot  water bath in winter. nice place to visit and lungar at gurdwara  . recommend to visit.
manikaran gurudwara manali,best place to visit..must visit this gurudwara..there is hot spring and cold spring together..in gurudwara lungar..foods are prepared by boiling through that hot water..
Manikaran,"Hey , M Visited Manaikaran Last Month 12th Nov  , Visited evening time both side view is so beautiful , Gurudwara is also Beautiful  with hot water cave , please visit 01 time in Manikaran , it's far from Manali 85 KMS"
WORTH VISITING,A memorable experience. One should not miss the hot cave. Religious believers will find it more amazing than scientific believers. Free lodging and boarding service is highly appreciated.
Superb Location worth seeing,Experiencing hot water spring and the stream adjoining is a natural wonder. Visiting this place is a must.
Good place to visit if you have one extra day,"It's 85km far from Manali and it need entire one day if you are planning to visit Manikaran. we went there and enjoyed it, road conditions are not too bad so it's manageable. it's a natural hot water spring which you can identify very easily because you will see lot's of vapors when hot water mix with cold river water.  People those are managing/running Gurudwara and Shiv Temple are very humble and supportive."
Good place,Sikhism founder Guru Nanak came to this place in 15 Asu 1574 Bikrami with his disciple Bhai Mardana.This gurdwara is of significance in Sikh pilgrimage. The gurudwara has a hot spring pool where pilgrims can take a dip.
Enchanting Gurbani,This is one of the most revered Gurudwara among Sikhs. It attracts people across all religions. The place has springs which also have medicinal values. Devotees take dip in the spring and eat langar.
Must Visit,"It is a long dirve from Manali, but worth your time and trouble. The road to this place itself is beautiful as it is between the River Parvathi on the one side and Parvathi Mountains on the other side. Once you reach, you will be greeted by the Gurudwara. As you enter, there is a hot water bath. As you go inside, you will find a cave which has a rock which is hot and gives you warm feeling. Come out and visit the Shiva Temple, which is awesome with Steaming Hot water inisde a small enclosure and another attached to the Gurudwara, where they cook food with the help of the hot water and serve. Simply amazing place. God / Nature has placed us with all her bounty and we dont even keep it up and maintain. We have such large ego that we claim it as ours. Just forget every difference and immerse yourself in that wonderful nature and you will realise how bountiful the mother is. Please HELP TO MAINTAIN CLEANLINESS AND AVOID LITTERING. It is a gift that we dont possess."
Manikaran Sahib!,Manikaran Gurudwara on the banks of Parvati river is a piligrimage famous for its hot springs! This place is truly mesmerising and peaceful with Parvathi valley in the backdrop! If you are in Manali don't miss this place.
Wahe Guru,While returning from manali we spent some time in Manikaran Gurudwara. There was so relaxing and peace. Satnaam wahe Guru
Must visit and divine experience,This is around 2hrs drive from manali.There is a Shiv mandir and Gurudwara  in the same complex.Hot tea is given as a prasad.Do visit the cave in the complex.Sight of hot springs was a divine experience
Must visit to explore Temple & Gurudwara in 1 exotic location,"We visited this place many times, with family and friends. located on parvati river in parvati valley, dont forget to do darshan of  Ram mandir and Gurudwara both. Have Prasad there  please.  I suggest all visit to explore  nature at its best around Manikaran Sahib."
Divine experience,Our trip to Gurudwara Manikaran sahib was divine. It was such a wonderful experience in total calmness. Sight of hot springs by the side was lovely. As prasad we had nice hot tea in cold weather of 7 degree..
Gurudwara Darshan,"I visited this Gurudwara in Manikaran in the year of 2016 ie 2years back but still can remember the beauty of this Gurudwara. Excellent and Great spiritual place. There is a Shiva  temple near this Gurudwara just at a distance of some feet which reflects unity among India. I had a wonderful experience. I would like to thank Guruji for taking us to hot cave, showing how the food is prepared from Hot springs water and its significance. I would like to express my gratitude towards all Guruji's of Gurudwara for explaining significance of this place. It is a peaceful and spiritual place.Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh"
Hindu and Sikh Pilgrimage Center,"Manikaran Gurudwara is located on River Parvati in the Parvati Valley, about 4 Kms ahead of Kasol close to Bhuntar in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh. This Manikaran is about 35 km from Kullu Town.Manikaran is a small town attracting tourists from all over India and particularly visiting  Manali and Kullu for its Hot springs.The Gurudwara located in this small town has Hot springs. The Gurudwara is very impressive and one have Prasad (food) at Langar. We visited this  Gurudwara on 12th September 2018 and impressed very much for its structure and especially for the Hot springs."
Only if you are devout,The hot spring and the ancient Shiva temple are now overshadowed by this large Gurudwara. There is nothing much in the way of aesthetic pleasure. The langar is good but the place seems less hygienic than the other Gurudwaras I have visited. The toilets were in appalling conditions and the hot water pools full of people did not really inspire confidence.
Sikh pilgrimage,I visited this place to see sulphur springs and really enjoyed the food in langar.They have ample space for tourists to stay with basic amenities....
Gurudwara in the Nature's Lap,Manikaran Gurudwara is situated at one of the best location in Himachal. Surrounded with hills and a the flowing river makes it a memorable location forever. This location is very near to Kasol and is easily accessible by our own vehicle or local buses. Don't forget to have a Langar (Prashad) in the Gurudwara.

A must visit to Gurudwara for Hot spring,The route to Manikaran is not in a good shape but off course driving along the riverside is in itself a beautiful experience for a drive lover. Also the hot water springs and the arrangement of Gurudwara would always make you go there.
Historical Gurdwara in Himanchal ..,This is a beautiful gurdwara along the river with hot spring right on it . It has historical importance related to Guru Nanak Dev ji .. a must visit in Himachal Pradesh .
The most holy place of Himachal ,So coming to this beautiful and holiest place called manikaran  gurdwara is the most calm place in himachal . I was here for 3 days and i was like I dont want to go back home . This is a must visit place for all travellers to seek blessings in himachal . It is just 3-5 kms from kasol so whenever kasol is on travel bucket list this gurdwara should also be there . There is a hot spring swimming pool which removes all the pain in your body and freshes the whole body . So make some travel plans of manali and visit this place for sure ..
Far away from Manali but must spot,Very big premise of the Gurudwara. This is on the bank of parvati river. Sulpher hot water is to be seen. Water coming from the underground was very hot ranging from 80°C to85°C.
Hinduism & Sikhism,Hindu and sikh pilgrimage make it more genuine beautiful and add more significance to this place.Visit both the shrines and fell the power of divine energy of this place.
Sikh Gurdwara,The founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak came to this place with his disciple Bhai Mardana.It has natural hot water springs.Langar (free food to devotees) is also served here.Its 4km away from the Parvati Valley (Kasol)
Very nice place,"The road to Gurudwara is pathetic and it has always remained like this. You will see snow-covered mountains on the way. Gurudwara is about 8 kms from Kasaul and about 17 Kms from highway. We had lungar there and had evening tea as well. The management of Gurudwara, cleanliness, some automation they have adopted in serving food is awesome."
Traveled Some Days Back ,Religious Place dedicated to Guru Granth Sahib and also Shiva Temple and Big Idol of Shiva near to Gurudwara. Kund natural hot water. Even boiling water kund is there where you can boil rice etc. It is one of the famous place of visiting list.
Nice place to visit,We visited Manikaran during our Kheerganga visit in the month of September 2018.  Its such a nice place very calm and clean.Inside the Gurudwara a hot water pool is there.  You can take bath in this pool and after taking batch go to Gurudwara and have lunger over there.A small market is there outside the Gurudwara from where you can buy prasaad and other things
A must visit place whenever you travel to Kasol/Kullu-Manali,"This Gurudwara is famous for its hot sulphur springs throughout the year.Located in the Parvati valley, northeast region of Bhunter. A must visit place while travelling to Kasol/Kullu-Manali. It has a scenic beauty and a peaceful experience.There are few temples too located nareby. Do try the traditional lunger."
Devotion and nature's marvel at one place..,Going further upstream from Kasol is the town of Manikaran which has the famous Gurudwara. Within the compounds are the hot water spings which are carefully directed to separate pools for men and women. The crazy parvati river flows besides the gurudwara and it is exhilarating to experience the hot waters of the pool besides the ice cold water of the river...
Worth visiting,"We had no plans for visiting this place, but incidentally we took a detour from Kullu while on our way to Manali. You would need haif day to visit this place from Kullu. The special attractions of this holy place are the hot water springs and caves, auspicious gurudwara, temples etc. which has its own mythological significance. We also enjoyed the Langar prasad in the gurudwara. People also follow the ritual of cooking a bunch of rice in the hot water there and taking it to home."
A place of hot water spring in cold weather ,Hot sulphur spring in the gurudwara was quite surprising as the weather was cold. Proper clean gurudwara. We are in the langer and it was quite good visit.
Holi Place,The place is on the bank of river parvati. Its very holi place to visit. It approx 80 to 90 kms from manali. its look beautiful.
Holy Place in Parvati Valley,This is a sacred place in the Parvati Valley just beside the Parvati river. Most of the tourist who went to Manali came here for a visit. It's a feel-good thing to do.  The water flow in the Parvati rive is immense.
A must see and do!,The manikaran Gurudwara is nestled in the hills of the himalayas. A beautiful peaceful place with the river parvati as your view while eating. There are beautiful hot baths attached to the temple and the food is cooked in the hot water. A beautiful bridge crossing the river outside the temple under all of the flags is a beautiful view for everyone. Very easy to get to and easy to find.
Gurudwara in God's Valley,Manikaran is some far away from Manali town but a place where anyone can get peace. A peaceful place.
few hours drive from manali,"well its not in Manali. it will take like 3 hrs to reach there from Manali. the best thing here is the river and the hot water stream, u can take bath there and all ur tiredness will get off. once u get down in level 1, u can see many sikh rituals which u may find interesting. there also a hindu temple colocated where also u will find devotees are taking bath. has a market near by it and has a lot of food court and shops. u can also taste free food in sikh langar which is also tasty. overall a different but worthy experience....."
SO SPIRITUAL,This place is very famous for their holy hot water spring. A bit far from Manali but truly worth it.
A visit to The Holy Manikaran Gurudwara,"If you are planning a trip to Manali, I would recommend on your return journey you must pay a visit to Manikaran. The way to Manikaran is a bit hectic due to poor road condition, but the beauty of Parvati rivar on the way is your payoff. The Gurudwara at Manikaran is really a beauty amidest of all the tough terrain. The natural hot spring at the place is a bonus. As per hindu mythology, this is the place where lord shiva while playing with her wife Parvati, lost the earring of hers. Seshnag tookaway that earring to his place. Later on when Pervati figured it out she requested lord Shiva to get her earring back. Shiva summoned seshnag with his Trisul. When Seshnag arrived at that place the place went superhot because of his poisonous breath. Thats how the hot-spring hasbeen explained in mythologies. In order to reach the shiv temple take the tunnels below the gurudwara underground. The tunnels are all hot and feels like sauna. Full of steam and warmth. It leads to the shiv temple on riverside. The water near the temple is boiling horribly. You can see people putting rice puddles and corns in that water and it gets boiled off immediately. Just Wow to that. The temple is shrine and the view of Pervati river by the temple is mesmerising. Also, I nearly missed to mention about the amazing 24x7 langarkhana at the Gurudwara. Its so neat and clean. Food offered there to all at all times. The foods were simple but soo tasty. Overall Manikaran remains special for me during my trip to Himachal. Hope you find it the same in your way.!"
Symbol of inter-religious unity,"Everything is good about this place.  The history, the gurudwara with hindu deities, the shiva temple in the campus, the simple yet satisfying langar, the fiercely flowing river"
Cool and peaceful place,"nice place to visit, enjoy a lot....Cool weather. very peaceful to stay. Excellent surroundings....Very interesting"
"Peaceful, divine and amazing langar",Its always peaceful to visit God's place and this was even better. The langar was amazing. The hot water pool is amazing too. You should carry a towel and undergarments and get rid of tiredness with a bath in it.
gurudar namasker,good goood goood goood the location goood the beaty of nature excellent so please go enjoy the heaven and the enjoy of the beauty of manali and manikaran .....
Nice place in Himalchal near kasol.,"We visit on 1st Jun 2018 this is the special place you can feel peaceful when you reached there, hot water you can bath and remove all tiredness and feel good. God is every where..."
Manikaran ShivaParvatimaa,Excellent place where the love of lord shiva and Maa Parvati can be experienced what written in holy book of Hindu. The hot water express angryness of shivaji and river parvati voice is self explanatory. How much she is happy. The event is well written in campus of Temple. The Beaty of parvati valley can only be experienced while going to Manikaran from bhuntar in himachal pradesh
Religious Place,"Good place to visit. It take full day for a trip to and from Manali. It has a water well, which is filled always with hot water. That's a unique thing."
nice temple,"water flow , walk through bridge, good atmosphere, easy reach to this place. surly enjoy weather in rain season."
Holly place,This is main attraction of Kullu. Place is holy place. This is very beautiful place. There is famous hot water kund.
Sacred beauty amidst the scenic mountains,"This Gurudwara is located about 80 KM's from Manali and 40 KM's from Kullu along the banks of river Parvati. The Gurudwara is surrounded by tall mountains and is famous for its hot srings. After the tiring journey , a dip in the holy hot water kund refreshes the body. Another speciality of this place is the Langer which is served. The Langer served is prepared in the Hot water spring. The rice are prepared in boiling water of the kund. Behind the Gurudwara there is a market which has Parshad and other novelty items. A must visit place if one is coming to Manali etc."
Awesome place and nice stay,"We visited this place last month and i  had booked the gurudwara Sarai as a option. But when we reached there Manikaran was jam packed , hence we couldn't look for any other option. Gurudwara provide free stay Free parking and free food. Amazing place."
Religious trip - Manikaran,It is a place which is being worshipped by both Sikh n Hindu religion based on beliefs. Here you see both cold water and hot springs at a same place. Nice surrounding.
Peaceful place,"The gurdwara is build on a river bank with hot springs. You can see the water on the river boil and the smoke. This place is hot inside due to the hot springs. Provisions for separate bath of males and females is available. The langarh serves good food. Do try the tea which is made using the hot water from the springs. It tastes a little different but good. The only cons is due to the spring, the place is a little wet and dingy at some places. The maintenance can be much better than what it is now."
june,Yash for providing us early check in service and he allowed us to take rest in hotel in the last day till evening .Room was really neat and clean.Also the staff were friendly. Definitely we will recommend this hotel for our friends and family . Keep up the good work.
A place of solicitude,We visited Manikarn very late in the night. Like any other Gurudwara it is also spic and span. It feels nice to cross the bridge with river Beas gushing below. We were the only person in the hot spring at that time. We were being invited to have food in the langar even at that hour though we could not as we had to reach Manali and it was already midnight. Very nice environment and very nice people.
Manikaran,Manikaran is off the Mandi - Manali highway about 30 KMs of the axis. Drive is through the picturesque Parvati Valley and nice and beautiful mountain road takes you to Manikaran.Manikaran is known for its Gurudwara and Shiva Temple and the hot springs .As you reach Manikaran you will see the Gurudwara and it's multi level car parking . Just don't think about parking your car in multi level car parking.It is a most chaotic place to be in. There is no traffic control or management and in all likely hood you may be stuck for good in this with no where to go.Chances of burning your clutch plates are pretty high and getting your car damaged is for certain. My advice park on the main road and walk down to the gurudwara and temple.Gurudwara and temple are located on the other side of the river. You get an amazing view of the hot springs flowing into the cold river waters and steam clouds being formed .The whole area is pretty crammed up and caution is needed while moving around in narrow tunnels and alleys of the Gurudwara .Shiva Temple is adjacent to the Gurudwara and there is a nice market selling various items.you will see people trying to boil rice and chana in the hot waters of the hot spring but it's is a failed effort and I ultimately just left it.There are good hotels as well as camping sites along the way to Manikaran and Kasol is also located just 10 KMs short of Manikaran .must visit while on your way to Manali or on the way back. I recommend on the way back from Manali .
Giid combination of gurudwara n hot water springs,The route to the place us very long n boring but the place is worth a visit. The gurudwara has many places which r unique because of the presence of hot water springs. The smell of sulphur is overwhelming n the sorry g us considered good ofor skin n health in general
One of the best place i visited,"This is not just a Gurudwara but a nice place to go while touring Manali.Manikaran is a small place with a small Valley. Gurudwara on one side and a Ram temple on other side. with a small market in between. The place is awesome as its quite, peaceful and have best weather changing any time. There is a hot water spring and bath available all the places."
Religious ,Religious place having hot springs. Place has temple of shivji and Parvati ji. Place has gurudwara. Place has mythological significant.Pravati river is chilling cool and hot springs next to it .One can't think water of spring's is so hot .
Weekend trip,"Excellent place to visit. The langar is well managed. The parking area is terrible, need more parking spaces."
So so,"Firstly it is very far from Manali and the road r in bad condition secondly,it is holy place for the mainly Sikhs."
Divine Place,Serene view. Its 3km from Kasol on the banks of river Pravati. Love the view and the  whole aura of religious atmosphere gives peace.
Divine place,Visited Manikaran Gurudwara with my family and it was a divine experience. The gurudwara is situated on the shore of Parvati river. It has hot springs. Lot of people visit this place.
Peaceful,It was serene sight. Loved the view and the sacredness of the place. Loved the sound of flowing river.
Religion among the greenery,"This gurudwara is in Manikaran, 3 km from Kasol built on river Parvati. It is a beautiful place which calms your mind and sitting inside the sanctum sanctorum brings out the hidden tranquility in you. The food here is perpared by boiling over hot water springs. You can participate in the ceremonial service of food. People who are tired of everyday activities can also book rooms here and stay for a couple of days.Don't miss this place by any chance. It's worth the experience."
"Exquisite location , serenity prevailing every where along with melodious mysterious sound of Beas River flowing","Its a worth visiting place with family for seeing not only the holy shrine for Sikh ,Hindu  and Hot Water Spring but also the serene view of the River Beas flowing underneath with  lofty snow capped mountains above.."
"""Worth Visiting""","Here, the holy river is so attaractive that even people can sit for hours and see the water flowing. I visited this place with my friends this month  and the visit was actually awsome loved visiting here, everthing was so special and specially ""Guru Ka Langar"" ."
Religious place for Hindu and sikh ,Location is terrific. Hot water spring. Situated at the bank of Parvati river. Sound of water is soothing and the whole aura of religious atmosphere gives peace.One tip:Try to avoid summer for this place. Simple reason is lots of tourist visit this place and you will not find anything what I mentioned above.
Nice place,Very good temple manikaran gurudwara in sikh religions very nice looking all sikh people very helpful
Worth the visit,Its a place for Old Shankar Mandir and hot springs. Worth the visit. However road to this place from Kullu is narrow and often have traffic jams especially in season.
Scenic,"MANIKARAN near KULLU is a place where the PARVATHI river and SANGAMA STHAL ( meeting point) with BEAS RIVER at this place (KULLU) is most scenic. GURUDWARA , place of worship for SIKHS is worth visiting."
Beautiful!,This place was beautiful and really spectacular! Anyone should visit this lovely religious site. I had a free meal inside the building and also went to the upper floor were the people do their prayers. Amazing place with mozaiek mirrors. It was amazing! If you are in the area make sure not to skip this place!
Manikaran - Earring ,Long n thrilling drive from Manali of 4-5 hours. On the way do River Rafting at Kullu. Which will save time of coming again.
Personally felt demoralised to visit the place,"I visited the place in the first week of June, with my family.  One should cover the place while returning from Manali and finally take a hotel and Kullu.The approach road from Kullu is in very badly damaged condition, in fact the worst in our whole tour of Shimla- Chail-Manali- Rohtang. The building of the Gurudwara is huge and it also has huge multi floor parking lot. But, if you are not regiously inclined, the worn out, discouloured look of the building does not create an awe in you. There is separate arrangement for ladies and gents to take bath in hot water kund outside and then inside also. Although men's washroom was found ok, ladies' washrooms were poorly maintained. However, men's  hot water kund was very good, although one has to be cautious for the steps inside water, which has become slippery due to moss.I understand that I visited the place during peak tourist season. The inside approach walkways, corridors, staircases were thickly crowded which is disheartening for a traveller who also visited the Amritsar's Golden Temple. I think given proper attention by the gurudwara management, the crowd can be properly managed, otherwise some accidents may also happen."
Enjoy Beas River! Peace n Tranquility! Awesome Langar !,"We were lucky that a weekday visit to the Gurudwara meant there were not much crowds. After offering our prayers in the main hall, we enjoyed the langar or guru prasad which was very delicious! The Beas river flowing right behind the Gurudwara offers splendid views!"
For faith....,"From Manali , it will take almost all of the day to visit Manikaran Gurudwara. I think one should visit it mainly if religiously inclined . The place is busy , vibrant and have good vibes. An old shiv Mandir is also in the same campus. Feels good to be there , if u r spiritually inclined.I didn’t found the hot spring as much of a spot , to travel half a day for. It is in the form of a pool , like tank . Situated in the basement sort of space. It is not well lit and is crowded. Can’t make out if it’s boiling hot just by standing near it. People taking bath in it made me wary of putting my hands in it. Not sure if the water in the pool is flowing , looks like it is stagnant. Besides it is not comfortable for women to take a dip there.  If u r going there just to see the hot water spring , do not go. But if u are a nature lover and u love driving in the wild u will enjoy the travel from Manali . Religious aspect or to enjoy the nature , only these two reasons r valid to invest a day , for this place."
Manikaran sahib,We visited manikaran sahib on our way back from manali. This place is of immense religious importance for hindus. Guru nanak dev ji visited this place alongwith his disciples. There is a natural hot spring water in the gurudwara. Must visit.
Immense religious valued location,Those visiting Himanchal and having one extra day should visit this location which  will provide the opportunity to have glimpse of  magnificent view of Beas and also Maikaran temple known for its hot springs which is located adjacent to  this gurudwara. You can also make  halt at Kasol en route to Gurudwara and enjoy tented accommodation and feel the real jungle life and serene environment  all along magnification beas river
Nice place to visit for Fun and worship,"Nice place to visit for Fun and worship. Nice drive. Has ample space for parking. Gurudwara, Shiv Mandir visit is attraction. Enjoy some hot spring bath in gurudwara and Pray in Shiv Mandir and cook some rice in boiling water of natural spring."
Amazing place.,What an amazing place. Mesmerised to see the boiling hot water at the banks on ice cold parvati river.This is a science but still a miracle. There is a huge amount of sulphur there but it was a miracle Guru Nanak Dev Ji to ask his follower to remove a particular stone to get the hit water to cook food.A must visit place which in Manali.
Gurudwara ,"Both my wife and I visited this sacred Gurudwara last year. Right on the banks of beas river with hot water springs right inside, so hot that you can boil rice in them."
Manikaran,Very serene mind experience good to see hot water pool and number of people living in one society sharing working being together which is our indian pride really good to be visiting Himalayan beauty with nice Jharna..
Different taste of experience and mixture of spirituality,"We decided to include Kasol - Manikaran route while we were returning from Manali and that was our last day of entire tour. We had to reach Kalka by 6 PM on that day itself. We didn't have any idea if that was at all possible. Yes, it's possible if you're in safe hand and if the driver is confident before taking extra charges separately for Manikaran. In Manikaran, the view that can enchant you are beautiful Parvati valley, remote villages, safe and clean road, Parvati river stream, forest, hot spring and Gurudwara Shri Manikaran Sahib. We were greatly pleased with the hospitality that the authority offers to everyone free of cost. Even we got lunch and a good cup of tea after lunch. All in all, it is a good choice have your check box ticked."
A must visit temple,"A trip to Kullu Manali would be incomplete without a visit to Manikaran. The temples and Gurudwara along with the hot water springs with healing properties provide a peaceful experience. The place is surrounded by mesmerizing mountains from all sides, and one does not want to leave the place after reaching there."
visit for a spring bath,"we have enough time do visit this place. hot spring bath is excellenthot cave is a must visit shiva statue look is mind blowing and please do have food form there , it will be a all new experience. dont expect a tasty food though"
great place to visit.Must see place,Sikh religion and hinduism coexist.Hot water spring with boiling water.Rice gets boiled in 15 to 20 minutes.Some dormant volcano must be keeping the water boiling.Wonder of nature.
must visit,"whether you are sikh or non sikh its a must to visit gurudwara sahib..as this is at a place which has equal reverence for locals, hindus and sikhs....guru nanak ji performed miracles here, for hindus this a legendary ancient place connected with shiva n parvati,,for locals its a place where devtas dwell"
Must visit,Manikaran is around 43 kms from Kullu. We visited the Gurudwara and spent some time there. It was very good feel being seated there. One has to climb 15 steps to reach Gurudwara. There is a hot cave beneath the Gurudwara and Langar served on the right side of Gurudwara entrance.
Beautiful Gurudwara,"I went to Manikaran Gurudwara. At an altitude of 1760 m, the surrounding landscape is as incredible and beautiful as the legends and beliefs rooted in the Hindu and Sikh faith that attract tourists and pilgrims from all corners of the world. It is great place to go."
Wonderful Experience,Better you alight at the starting point (1st bus stop) itself while going to Manikaran. Bathing places are available on both sides of the river. Gurudwara is awesome. Well maintained. One can have Lunger (food) after Gurudwara darshan.
Divine Experience,"This Gurudwara is mentioned in the 'Twelfth Guru Khalsa' by Giani Gian Sikh, making it a worship place of immense significance for the Sikhs. The langar here is very big and it serves free food to disciples and the needy."
Nothing to visit,"I went to Manali with Family in May, 2018 and heard lot about Manikaran, so while returning from Manali I planned to visit Manikaran too. It is at a distance of 75 km from Manali, but if your are travellling towards Chandigarh then you have to take a detour of 32km only from Bhunter.Way to Manikaran/Kasol is amazing with steep roads and lot of curves on road running besides the flowing Parvati River.Got very disappointed after get to know that Manikaran has only a Shiv Temple and Gurudwara and some very small ponds of Hot spring water.Plase is too congested and very dirty.Place is not recommended if you do not have spiritual beliefs. Manikaran has nothing to offer other than Spirituality."
Trip ,Manikaran gurudwara is famous for hot spring waters even in winters It’s around 35 kms from Kullu Manikaran is situated in the banks of the river.Where you can feel the presence of god and the purity of the place.Don’t forget to have langar
Should visit,Very good place to visit. Children enjoy cooking in the hot water(the water is very hot. Don't put your hand in it).There is a Shiv temple out of the Gurudwara near the market where you can cook your own prashad.
Divine Experience,"Visited this Gurudwara during our trip to Manali. Was a very soothing and peaceful atmosphere, we had langer for the first time here."
Hot springs ,Manikaran has both shiva temple & gurudwara. To reach this place you need to travel around 35kms from Kullu. Nice scenery to watch while driving. Langar ( food) is available in temple premises. Before langar you can have hot bath from hot spring. They made separate place for men & women’s bath. Cleanly maintained place.
Worth the travel,"Located far off from kullu, this is a must visit gurudwara near kasol valley... The view of the beas river is just breath taking and will give eternal peace and tranquility to the soul... highly recommended..."
Feeling blessed,So nice .. everyone should to visit to complete ur journey...langar is so tasty n good environment...
Best Place to visit,Best Place to visit and surprised yourself with nature's mystery about hot Spring where anyone can boil rice or potatoes.
Only one word about this is Amazing!!,"In the month of January When, I visited this one with my wife it was just amzing. All water around Manali was in half frozon condition but here we saw warm water coming from the underground."
Hot springs,Highly religious place with geothermally heating water. This gurudwara is a must visit in Manali. The food offered here is also of good quality and served with respect. One can have a tummy full of tasty meal.
Gurudwara is amazing the walking pathway to reach there is DIRTY and TACKY ,"Famous for its hot water springs the holy place is amazing and the even have a man made separate “kund” / pool to enjoy natural hot water bath. Well the good things end here. I have been to many Gurudwaras(both famous and not so famous) and they are always well maintained neat and clean but i’m sorry to say this is the most dirty, unclean and mis managed gurudwara i have visited. The surroundings are very dirty, with even dry,wet cow dung lying on the road."
Natural wonder at a divine place,The location of the Gurudwara is breathtaking. This is a very old building and there is a hot water spring coming under the rocks. Even the rice which is served as Prasad is made with the heat of this hot water spring. There is a special chamber nearby for natural spa as this steam is believed to have medicinal properties. There is a large public bath made from the same hot water which visitors frequent and take a dip before heading in.Must visit and there is everything here for people of all age groups..
Simply Awesome!,"Superb place to relax your mind. It is not in Manali but on way to Manali, somewhere at Kullu you have to go uphill for 17 Kms to reach the place. It has Hot water spring, overall fab."
Soothing Environment!,I always visit this whenever I visit Manali. Weather and views at this Gurudwara are always awesome. A combination of hot and cold breeze. You can have darshan at Gurudwara in minutes.
cant miss visit to gurudwara,"Gurudwara holds special location, it has hot spring water and flow of Beas river is astounding. after darshan we went up for small trek and it was fun."
A must visit Shrine like gurudwara near kasol .,"I visited this place twice this year , i real feel connected to teh place its a few Km from kasol , and a must visit for people with religious believes, you will have a spectacular view of river flow , Wind blow near the bridge just before you reach Gurudwara . there langer is available 12 hours full day with tea also free of charge , you will hot spring water as well ."
Good day trip from Manali,It' s a day trip from Manali. Here you can take a dip in the river. Beas river has great flow under the bridge connecting to gurudwara. Worth going if you have religious spirit.
Mix Trip to manikaran kullu manali,"Manikaran Gurudwara is in valley, which has great view in and around,We had langar and we liked it, the best part of this langar is that the rice cooked in the hot spring waters,After our langar when we went to clean our hand the water was warm and it is from hot spring water, it was the amazing expierence, I think that was my first and last expierence with natural hot springs water,The time we visited was great, it was october the weather was just perfect.A must visit place and take blessings of sri gurunanak gi"
Old Gurudwara with Hot Sulphur Bath,"Manikaran is a religious place of Sikh and having very Old Gurudwara and Sulphur bath. Travelling time from Manali to Manikaran approx. 2-3 hrs one way on mountain roads. Gurudwara is situated at very scenic location . there is bridge which is the only way to enter the Gurudwara , river flowing with high current . Visitor Can take bath on Hot bath than pay darshan in Gurudwara. After Darshan we ate Lunch at Lunger Kitchen. behind the Gurudwara is Raghunath temple ."
natural beauty,"must visit place if visiting Kullu Manali, this place is full of natural beauty. the water is very very hot."
Holt Place with Hot Water,On the way to Shimla from Manali we visited this holy place of Sikh Religion. This Gurudwara also famous for mountain hot spring.
Nice place with plenty of Natural beauty,This a nice place to visit along with Kullu Manali package. The prime attraction is the hot spring and a beautiful temple. You can feel total peace of mind amongst the unbelievable natural beauty
Amazing,"The gurudwara and a temple nearby are built around sulphur hot springs. The place is situated on the banks of river Beas. Inside the shrine there is a place to stay (which is free of cost) and they also offer food. They have a place to take bath and there are changing rooms as well. Hot caves inside the gurudwara is not to be missed. A word of caution, the water is boiling hot hence be careful before venturing into the water bodies in this area."
Amazing Hot spring,"Holy Place !!You have so many hot springs around the temple and there is hot cave inside,the place is natures best creation.People here are very helpful.you can have lungar, also stay here overnight.As a tourist we can maintain cleanliness ,that will be a great contribution to this place!!"
Hot spring water,"70 kms from Manali and 3 kms from Kasol, Tourists come here to visit holiness of the Gurudwara.Must take a bath in holy hot spring water, eat langar."
Worth to Visit..Have some nice tasty food in Lungar in Manikaran,I visited Manikaran. The place is a religious place for Hindus. There is a Gurudwara in Manikaran. You can see Cold water and Hot water spring side by side. I have seen that very hot water (100 degree C) is coming from the earth. This hot water is used to cook food for Lungar. 2-3 hours can be spent here.
Amazing experience,"Though I have been to Manali many times, this was my first trip to Manikaran & the visit to Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib was a cherry on the cake. Its perfect set amidst the towering mountains & the gushing Parvati river makes it even more beautiful. Ofcourse a very pleasing & peaceful experience"
Avoid if your trip is anything but religious,"The place is located 35 km from Kullu, the road is not in good condition and it may take 1:30 hrs to reach the location. We visit this place while traveling from Simla to Manali which added 70 kms of additional travel which was very tiring. The gurudwara and shiva temple is located on the banks of Parvati river.In gurudwara premises there is a how water bath for gents and ladies and hot stone cave. The premises are poorly maintained, not enough lighting is there and place looks dirty.Though the gurudwara you can go to bazaar and Shiva temple.

One of the best place to Visit in Manali.,"One of the best place to Visit in Manali. One of the best place to see the Miracle happening in front of you. On one side you have super chilled melted icy water and on other side you see super hot boiling water. Single word for this place is ""Miracle on Earth""."
Fantastic - Wahe Guru,"What a beautiful place. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Kasol/Tosh. We both loved the atmosphere, the nature, and most importantly, the tranquility of the gurudwara. Nice amenities too - multilevel parking right in front was quite helpful as we didn't want to walk a lot. Stayed for an hour or so, but I would say this is one of the best places we visited over the week long Kullu Manali trip."
Gurdwara ,A Holly place with warm water and cold weather. Peaceful place. But required little management to keep it clean. You should eat Langer at gurdwara
Perfect stay!,"If you are looking for peace and away from known people and just want to explore new thing and may be just be try to figure out where you want to be, go Manikaran. It is just beautiful and the gurudwara is most beautiful place on earth. the gurudwara is located on the other side of river and located right below Parvati valley. the Kheerganga terk is very near to the place! you can go as bagpacker and stay for free in gurudwara, and do seva, they allow you to cook and serve people, and you can roam around. Dont worry your luggage is safe! The hot spring water on top of kheerganga is worth the entire trek to the place!"

Gurudwara,One of the most beautiful place. You have to cross a bridge over river flowing profoundly...there are hot water wells  having boiling water..where they boil rice and chola which they use for serving lunch in langar.
Much ado about nothing,"Manikaran Gurudwara and the adjacent hot spring were recommended as one of the better attractions around Manali, and naturally I was quite eager to see them. Unfortunately, one sight and I was left quite disappointed. The gurudwara looked quite ordinary, and the hot spring was an eyesore, what with semi-naked men dipping in it. The only takeaway was the langar - I hadn't eaten in a langar before, and this particular experience is going to stay with me."
Hot springs of Himalayas,This gurdwara has natural hot spring showers which is considered holy for Sikhs and many people have bath there . They even make rice over the hot springs for 'langar' .
Gurudwara ,Gurudwara is beautiful to watch. Many panjabi bhai visit the place. Free food are provided to the common people.
Hot water,It has natural hot water bathing area separate for men and women. It is believed that taking bath in this water cures skin infection
A holy pilgrim center,The approach of this gurudwara is very dirty that compels a tourist to think twice to step up further. The hot spring and the natural hot cave is best attraction for the tourist.
Hot water springs,This place is about 90kms from Manali. It has an natural hot water springs which comes from the ground. It is an holy place where you will find lot of people worshipping as well as taking a bath in hot water tub. Gurudwara has parvati river passing next to it and looks beautiful.

Peace in Himachal ,I loved this place.It gives you mental peace and amazing view.It has a hot water bath here and the road trip from Manali to mani karan can’t be described in words.
"Amazing visit, eat at the langar","Amazing,amazing experience. Don't go with a lot of expectations and you will come out really happy you visited this gurudwara. Though am not a Sikh, have always found gurudwaras one of the most positive energy places I have visited, and Manikaran was no different.Firstly, the river flowing through with visible hot springs by the side as you cross the bridge is a nice experience. There are hotwater pools where you can either take a bath or just wash your limbs. Visit the Hindu temple inside and post that, I suggest sitting down cross legged, and having a simple meal at the Langar. Simple Kadi chawal and roti, most basic of fare, yet very warm and tasty. Just 3-4 kms from Kasol main bus stop, I'd suggest you hitchhike or walk up to the gurudwara, visit it, and then move on to Barshaini from where you can do the khirganga trek(like me) or move to Pulga,Tosh or Malana for a night or 2."
Rice,Manikaran guruduwara is very piece full place. I went to this place and I get guruduwara's rice. This rice are very testi .
"Must visit for anybody who loves ""Nature Wonders""","Amazing and mystic place with a mix of very cold weather and hot water fountains. Actually one is tempted to take a bath in the hot water kund in the Gurdawar so be prepared accordingly. There is a hot cave where you can sit and relax and take a natural sauna (no where it is available in the world). There is a temple right next to the Gurdwara and a small street market, all a must visit"
Visit to Manikaran Gurudwara is a must to enjoy Natural Wonder,"Though the road to Manikaran is quite narrow but local Drivers are quite well versed with it & will take you safely. Once you are there , the first thing you come across is the sight of hot vapours around & as you approach the bridge, you are wonderstruck by the natural phenomena of Boiling Hot Water springing out of a chilly cold flowing Beas River . This has been happening since ages & Gurudwara here is famous for this.  They have constructed few resting rooms in the Gurudwara complex where the floors of the rooms are quite hot , you sit on these floors for some time & your body feels energised. Having Langar here after paying Respects to Guru Granth Sahib ji , is divinely ."

The Shiva Statue as well as the linga form are worth watching for hours. The hot spring in front of statue is used for cooking rice and dal by the temple authorities. Manikaran itself is popular for hot springs and this is one of the must see places in Manikaran. The temple is next to the Gurdwara and both should not be missed if you are in Manali.
