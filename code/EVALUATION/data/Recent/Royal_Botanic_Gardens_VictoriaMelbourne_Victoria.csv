Magical vibe,I had like 2hours in the city and I'm glad I chose to walk here. Its amazing. So many colours and shapes and well maintained park. Has a magical vibe :)
Lovely gardens,Visit was just after the park reopened after the Covid closure. Was busy but generally people were social distancing and wearing masks
"Best botanical gardens in Melbourne, back don't get conned.","If you go to Melbourne, there are many 'so-called' botanical gardens to see but this one is the best. When we arrived at our hotel, a man asked if we wanted to see the botanical gardens and he charged us 30 dollars each but just took us to a park in some suburb. It wasn't until we got back to our hotel that the receptionist told us that we didn't actually go to the real one but we did have a nice time and, coming from the  USA, it was nice to get out into nature anyway. The next day we went to the real one with a proper guide but, it was a lot of walking to do because its so big, and honestly the park we went to the day before was good enough for us. We are not really into plants that much to be honest. If you like big green trees and plants though, and lots of green grass then you will be happy with this place. The other thing to be aware of is that there are no Pizza Hut, subway or Taco Bell anywhere  there so eat before you go."
Running the Tan,"The Tan, officially known as the Tan Track, circumambuates the Royal Botanic Gardens. It's a  testing run, of around 2 1/2 miles (around 3.8 kms). Professional sportsmen run with part-time joggers. There's no pressure, set your own pace. The Gardens are just across Princes Bridge south of the city, it's an easy walk from the CBD, ask your concierge for details. There are many things to do in the Gardens, but the Tan is popular with runners..The current record is  10 minutes for men, 11 minutes for women."
More than a complete day,"I love walking around these gardens, possibly the best gardens around, even better than Singapore’s and that is saying something"
good,the botanic garden is a place where you can sit around after a rough day. very refreshing and very beautiful
"Beautiful, peaceful gardens",It was lovely and peaceful walking through the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne seeing the beautiful lakes covered in water lilies and the flowers everywhere.
Well worth a visit,"Although we visited during the early days and outbreak of covid19, it was really lovely and peaceful to walk around. Lovely views over Melbourne and stunning plants and scenery. Time to chill out from the hustle and bustle of city life."
An oasis in the city,"We were fortunate to be staying in an apartment close to the AAMI so it was a short stroll through Gosch's Paddock and over the Morell Bridge to access the Gardens at Gate A.  There are about another nine gates spread around the perimeter so it should be easy to enter the gardens from any direction.  There is no admission fee.It's a lovely peaceful place for a wander on well maintained paths - pick up a leaflet at the gates, follow the signposts or just go where the mood takes you.  There are a few places where we were looking across the greenery at the cityscape in the background however it's such a large place that we didn't hear traffic noise.  There are nooks and crannies to explore too - we had a walk through a forest trail in Fern Gully at one point, the herb garden and the tropical glass house (where it was a bit humid to hang around too long).Near the National Herbarium a pile of timber is all that is left of a gigantic tree where generations of people had gathered for photographs in the past.  The memory may live on.  However there is no shortage of other trees and plants of all sorts from around the world.  There was not a lot of colour - perhaps just a seasonal thing - but I guess it may just be a place to appreciate some green space in an otherwise busy city.  The cafe located alongside the Ornamental Lake looked nice enough but we were not too impressed by the products we bought.  It was a shame because it was a nice setting.We exited eventually through the Observatory gate which leads to another nearby, unlikely attraction, The Shrine of Remembrance."
Great relaxing gardens,We stayed in Melbourne for 4 days at the Royce Hotel and walked in the gardens 5 times. It was a highlight of our trip.
Beautiful Gardens.,Nice garden scenery and some information on each of everything. Need at least a full day to enjoy this beautiful garden.
A fantastic place to visit which no one should miss,"We spent the best part of a day wandering through the RBG in Melbourne when we were staying in the city on our recent trip to Australia. And what a simply amazing place these gardens turned out to be. In fact, they were one of the highlights of our entire visit to Australia. So many lovely, different, themed areas. Stunning, colourful themed gardens areas; wooded areas with wonderful trees (we specially liked the Australian Forest Walk and the Fern Gulley); spacious, open, beautifully kept lawns; some wonderful wildlife; lakes with so many different views. And all a peaceful oasis in the middle of the busy city. Our favourite area was the Lower Yarra River Habitat, which we just had to walk through twice! Plus a lovely restaurant serving great coffee and delicious food. We absolutely loved it here."
Stroll through to the city! ,"Why not take a walk through the beautiful botanical gardens! Especially on a sunny day, it’s so nice to grab some picnic food or a juice and chill on the grass or anywhere, there are so many great spots, either in the sun or under the huge trees in the cool shade. Want to walk, jog, run or cycle even yoga, you choose, it fits no matter what.  There is also a nice little garden centre bit, not necessarily a garden centre but you can walk in and look at all the beautiful plants."
Nice walk despite bad weather,"Unfortunately it rained badly most of the day we were in Melbourne city and it started raining on our way to the  Botanic Gardens. Despite the awful weather, we had a nice walk around the gardens and saw some nice flowers and plants. I'm sure it would be even (well, a lot) better when the weather is nice."
Super pretty,"The garden is quite large and offers a lot of variety, including quiet spots to just have lunch. I highly recommend a visit if you're in town :)"
Beautiful,Rain or shine this is a good place to while away the time.Walking distance from Flinders Station. On a good day there will be several weddings going on adding to the attraction. Not enough places for coffee or lunch and easy to get lost but not big enough not to be found again.
Explore Melbourne's green heart,"It was a while since I last visited the Melbourne Botanic Gardens and I'd forgotten just what a joy the Gardens  are. There are  many places to explore, among my favourite places is Fern  Gully, an oasis of rainforest in the city.. Many Melburnians just like to wander through the Gardens. The Gardens cover 38 ha (94 acres). The Gardens have lots of signs, just follow where you want to go. Picnickers are welcome.."
Beautiful surroundings,"Royal Botanic Gardens are very large and peaceful.  You can walk on your own or book a tour.  There is sufficient signage throughout the area as well, so it is easy to navigate.  Besides having thousands of different types of plants they also have some beautiful fountains as well."
my favourite place in town,"dear tourists, as a melbourne local I 100% recommend that you do yourself a favour and visit this place. it’s absolutely magical and definitely worth your time!"
"10,000 reviews!","Upon writing this, I’m number 9,999 of the reviews. Do I recieve a prize if I hit 10,000? LolWell what can I say, apart from this is a MUST visit. We had 5 days in Melbourne and took a walk through on one of the more warmer sunnier days. Stunningly beautiful park."
Never ending,"If you didn't follow a map it would seem like the walking paths are never ending. Plenty of signs next to the trees, flowers, shrubs to give you a little education on what your looking at. I went in the off season and it was still amazing just a lot less people which was nice."
Take the tour,"If you don't want to walk the entire garden, an open air tram takes you around the entire park. Beautiful gardens."
An oasis of colour,What a treat to stroll round this colourful gardens with all the exotic plants you don't see in Europe. On a hot day there is little shade but the sights and smells make up for an discomfort. Great place for a picnic.
Great park,"If you have time for to see only one of Melbourne's many attractions, make sure to visit the Royal Botanical Gardens. Absolutely fantastic. Even on a stinking hot day, as it was when I visited, there's plenty of shade and cool gullies to keep the heat at bay. I particularly enjoyed the Australian native forest trail and the fern tree gully sections, both of which were brilliantly presented. The cafe/restaurant onsite was also very well done. All in all, the Botanical Gardens was the highlight of my visit to Melbourne"
Mr,Great place to visit.  Lots of different flora to see. Excellent for families.   We saw some swans which were really beautiful
Enjoyable couple of hours,"You can spend quite a while here wandering around checking out the scenery. Really peaceful and relaxing. Good coffee shop near the entrance.  We were here during Coronavirus and was one of the placed still open and where you could keep your distance. Well connected to the other parkland, the river, the War Memorial and a nice walk to and from the city."
Lovely day out,Beautiful gardens and with quite fun installations to get kids involved. We particularly liked the volcano and fern gully. Beautiful lake and it was lovely to see wildlife enjoying the space. Nice and big for a day out but not an overwhelming size. Great gift shop too! Definitely recommend for a nice day!
Relax in the city,"Get in a good walk and take in the rose garden, unique plants, huge old trees and various gardens all while enjoying nature in the city center."
Beautiful Botanical Gardens,Definitely worth taking time out to enjoy these beautiful gardens they are very large and we didn't have time to do them all.But so glad we did visit definitely well worth visiting if you are spending time in Melbourne.Highly recommended for relaxing stroll.
Gardens Experience,Walk around the many paths with lots of beautiful plants of all types. Difinately a worthwhile experience.
Fantastic afternoon,"Species of plant life to suit all tastes. With its herb gardens to the exotic. Eat at one of the  cafes or cool off by the lake, each of the  paths take you around resplendent gardens."
Absolutely beautiful!,"Take the time to spend a couple hours here!  Just beautiful, even at the end of the summer season!  We especially loved Fern Gully!"
relaxing in midle of heaven,so many plants trees flowers from around the world its really interesting  some area for sleeping under the trees some area for lovers  its for everybody
Very green,The royal botanic garden are wonderful for a a stroll during a warm day. It's quiet and very green. There are also toilets and a restaurant.
Stunning,"This place is like an oasis in the middle of melbourne. We were blessed with a particularly nice warm summer days, but even still, the flowers, woodland etc, everything is just so well kept."
"Here, or the seaside?","On our last full day in Melbourne we had to decide between here and St Kilda’s. We chose the botanical garden as we leave tomorrow to go to the coast.We were delighted with our choice, which is really well looked after and in pristine condition. The weather was good, so that helped! We are not gardeners but we really enjoyed this visit and would thoroughly recommend it."
Beautiful ,Really pretty well kept gardens. Lovely cafe and facilities. A great lay out easy to get around with good sign posting. Well worth a visit give your self lots of time easily spend a good afternoon in them.
Delightful urban oasis ,"Such a large area with so many trees and plants, winding footpaths and shady nooks. A pleasant peaceful place to explore or enjoy a quiet few hours, so close to the CBD."
Walk Picnic,"A beautiful place to stroll, relax, picnic, with beautiful views of the Yarra and the City.  Buy a take-away lunch on  Southbank and dine here."
Enjoy for Free,What a magnificent setting so close to the City of Melbourne Surrounded by the famous Yarra river and surrounding the outside of the gardens is a running and fitness track 4kms It’s safe and classy Inside the Botanical gardens are well groomed gardens and plants and trees of every kindA lovely pond awaits  as well to feed the swans and ducks but be careful how you feed them as we want them to stay healthy and graceful  A lovely cafe area sells all the usual items to enjoy the gardens ( teas coffees drinks and cakes )Make sure you dispose of used items carefully to keep these gardens clean It’s freeFresh air Wonderful atmosphere for all ages Young & old It’s worth to wonder thru and explore for an hour or so Melbourne’s weather can be tricky It changes so wear comfortable clothes Lots of photo options as you can also see the city skyline in certain parts
A must when visiting melbourne,"This was a great place to start our vacation in Melbourne. Just superb. Easy to reach via the tram from Melbourne. Just be sure to buy a tram ticket. I thought trams were free, but not outside this area."
Very relaxing,"These gardens are absolutely huge and you could spend most of your day here. It’s also great for a morning or afternoon stroll, or a coffee in the cafe. Entry is free and there are just so many things to see!"
Great place after a rain,Saw this park on the map and thought of Regent Park in London. This park stands on its own. The Royal Botanic Gardens have a collection of plants from around the world and the architect laid it out in what was then a revolutionary pattern of curves and trails. I happened in right after a heavy rain and the smells and sounds were amazing especially in the Queensland rain forest section. It's a sensory experience. The succulent garden around the volcano (a reservoir of water runoff to contribute to sustaining the garden) was spectacular with all sorts of different colors and patterns. This is a well put together and maintained garden with all sorts of activities to attract you.
Fabulous gardens all year round ,It is  always such a buzz to visit the gardens.There is always lots of flora and fauna  to see. Spend your time walking around the maze of Pathways  or just chilling in the tranquil environment at a park bench or on the lawns . Take your time to explore The beautiful lakes and bird life. Take a picnic  and spend a few hours here easily. And check out what events might be being held in the gardens on the day you visit
Beautiful Gardens,This is a beautiful place to have a peaceful experience and a place to learn. Get a group of friends and make it even more fun as there are plenty of places to have a picnic.
Lovely,Great spot to visit in Melbourne.  Go for a run around the gardens (The Tan track) - or just walk around inside.  Great views of the city beyond the greenery.Very nice.
Gardens,"Didnt know what to  expect as it has been so long, was absolutely amazed at grounds, so inviting for picnics and family time"
Great,"Fantastic gardens in the centre of Melbourne. You name it,  they've probably got it .... botanically speaking."
Expansive gardens worth visiting,"We visit Melbourne’ Royal Botanic Gardens at least once annually. The gardens are expansive with a variety of landscapes, lots of flora types and many lawn areas for a range of activities from active recreation to quiet contemplation."
Beautiful to visit!,Beautiful gardens - these are a not miss on your trip. You can just walk for hours and there’s so much to learn. Free too! Such a treat.
Beautiful ,We are more the kind of ‘real nature’ instead of planned nature but this park is really amazing. The set-up is very beautiful and the maintenance really stunning. I believe that even the toughest “I am not a nature nor walking person” will be impressed while walking these premises. BTW: free entrance; it just cost you your time.
Beautiful park with lots going on,This is a lovely place to visit whether you just want to walk around and take in the scenery or are attending an event such as the open air cinema. I would highly recommend it as a bit of a break from the bustle of the city.
Just an amazing place,"We have seen lots of gardens and city parks, but this is by far the best. Peaceful, trashless, respectful people, well manicured, etc.A great mix of native plantings and some imports, great labeling, maps and markers. So many different areas for couples or small groups to gather but don't take away from the enviroment."
Beautiful sanctuary in the heart of Melbourne,"Nestled in the heart of Melbourne I could easily spend an entire day meandering around the botanic gardens, picnicking on the lawns, enjoying the birdsong. It's a peaceful haven, perfect for a restful break."
"Beautiful Gardens, look, smell and sound incredible ","Such a beautiful place to spend some time, not only beautiful to see but the scents and the sounds of the birds add to the experience There’s a lot of walking, some small hills but the paths are well kept and where there’s uneven areas they are well marked out There’s a nice tea rooms and a visitor centre where you can get refreshments and plenty of toilets around the park Be prepared to spend at least half a day walking around seeing all the well marked trees and plants, if you can take a picnic and spend the day It’s quite and tranquil"
Nice place to chill,"Always a great place to take a stroll, large area to lose yourself in the middle of a great city. Well maintained.  Great lake walk"
My fave part of melbourne,"So I’m local to the area. I work in an office on st kilda road in finance, so I regularly seek refuge from my office and take a walk around this magnificent park. Not much cover from the rain so just pick a dry day."
Friendly knowledgeable staff,We went on the 1.5 hour tour. The volunteer was very knowledgeable and the tour was free. Lovely gardens and lakes.
Lovely walk through Botanic Gardens,"Very peaceful and tranquil walk through the gardens. They are beautifully managed. We ended the walk at The Terrace cafe, where we sat outside with a great view of the lake and had tea and scones."
A walk in the park.,Lovely gardens with tea house and lakes.Lots of wonderful plants and trees especially giant English Elms!!
"Terrific and serene, wonderfully maintained and easy access. Generally very quiet and peaceful. Wonderful species","Terrific place, wonderful plants and species of trees. Quiet, easy access and great views of the city. Two nice cafes in the park. What is not to like???"
Beautifully manicured,"Being born in Melbourne I have always loved the Royal Botanic Gardens.  There is usually something new to explore or just seat peacefully!  If you travel to Melbourne the Gardens are a must see and experience, highly recommended.  Check their website for more information."
Educational - would recommend to all,"The walk was one of the best indigenous-guided walks that I've been on. Dan, our guide, was very personable and knowledgeable, and was able to share his story in a way that underscored the effects of colonialism on indigenous people. As we learned about native uses for some of the plants, we also learned how diametrically opposed Aboriginal and European worldviews were during the time that Australia was being colonized (and continue to be in modern times)."
Stunning,Beautiful and peaceful. Huge variety of plants. An oasis so close to the CBD. Lots of space. Nice cafe too
Beautiful spot,"I loved it there. It was free to enter and there were so many hidden away spots to get a bit of quiet time. There always seemed to be some sort of event going on, movie in the park, concert...wish I could have spent more time there!"
Everybody should take this walk,An excellent guided walk with an immensely impressive guide - strongly recommended to any visitor or resident who would like an introduction to indigenous plants and aboriginal culture
Great free attraction,"Well landscaped and expansive stand of flora from around the world but focused, naturally, on Australia. The observatory buildings are fascinating. Everything is kept tidy and in good order, it's astonishing that the cost is borne without an entrance fee. Wonderful refreshment pavillion by an attractive lake (soz, billabong). Would have appreciated a few more labels on plants."
Exceptional botanical garden,"Australia really does botanical gardens right. Australians must be so disappointed when they visit botanical gardens in other countries. Of all the ones we have visited, this was one of the best. It is big, trees are mature. Very beautiful. And free"
So Serene,"I have not been to the gardens for years was totally amazed how beautiful it was, we are so blessed in Melbourne to have such an amazing garden, so serene and amazingly beautiful. Great day out for a stroll or a picnic with a partner or friends and family. I will be back"
"Relaxing, tranquil and beautiful - a great place for all","Weekly walk: I walk around and through these beautiful gardens at least 2x a week. They are always improving the gardens and are currently working on the sensory garden and some big trees.At the Shrine end - the main entrance allows you to see where they house Shakespeare performances [on the left] and there is a lovely cafe and shop, plus the children's gardens on the right just as you enter the gardens. There are the stunning sculptured bushes on the left opposite the children's garden too.There are many paths to choose from in these gardens and if you take your time can take up to 3 visits to see it all. I usually spend an hour, but per visit. There is a herb garden and the newly completed fern boardwalk accompanied by a cool spider web like hanging seat. You have a few small ponds and the bigger lake to visit, complete with gondola tours for about $35. These are opposite the cafe which is also a great place to sit and read, have a coffee and watch the wildlife walk around - ducks and the like, there are also eels in the lake. Please do not feed the wildlife and clean up after yourselves by putting items in the clearly marked rubbish bins. People have picnics and parties here, the options are quite varied.If you love to photograph wildlife, flora and fauna, this is a photographers dream, especially in the morning just after they have opened. You can walk your dogs here too, but keep them on a leash and please clean up after them too. There are a few places to visit within the gardens and there are maps you can have or photograph at the main entrances. There are clearly marked signs so you know where you are going. There is also a courtesy shuttle that runs at certain times - so keep an eye out for the clearly marked stops signs. Love this place - so diverse and uplifting and yet so peaceful."
Absolutely lovely,Great venue and very well maintained. A leisurely walk is relaxing and stimulates the senses. Take time to enjoy and relax a little
Fabulous gardens,We thouroughly enjoyed our day out at Melbourne Botanical gardens.  They are so well laid out and are much nicer than the botanical gardens in Sydney.  A lovely place to go with a picnic on a sunny day.You can do a nice walk along the Yarra river to the Botanical Gardens and take in some great scenery.
Superb,"You could spend a couple of days easily strolling around the gardens and never see all of it. The cafe had a good selection of refreshments and food available, with the birds keeping you entertained. If you prepare a beautiful place for a picnic."
Great afternoon ,"Really great to have a walk. There is a lot of variety, the garden is wonderful. We can have a nice city view and chill on the grass"
Beautiful Gardens,We spent the afternoon visiting these beautiful gardens with so many varieties of plants and flowers. Just a lovely relaxing space to visit in the heart of Melbourne.
Great walking spot,Come on now.  How could this not be a great spot for a walk and maybe some hacks sacking.  Been a few times and always lovely.
A true highlight,The walk is beautiful and informative about the history of this land and practical uses of specific plants. Our guide shared both global and deeply personal perspective on our relationship with land and with each other. Highly recommended.
Great explorer ride,We took the 30 minute ride through the park.  It was informative and a great way to learn more of what is in the Gardens.  We were able to hop off and have tea near the lake and then back on.  It allowed us to get an overview of areas to know where we wanted to go back to.
Gorgeous trees and landscaping with a beautiful fountain.,Be sure to look up into the trees for birds and small animals. Close to other historic attractions located in the city center.
Wonderful Gardens - go on the free tour.,"What a wonderful place. A 30 min stroll from the edge of the free tram network brings you to these gardens.  I highly recommend the free daily tour,our guide Nada was brilliant, really knew the history of the gardens and plants and made sure everyone was included.  Plenty of shade on a hot day, one of the must do things in Melbourne."
Avoid the shopping and enjoy the space,This is a wonderful green space in the city. Absolutely up there with any other botanical gardens I have visited in Australia or other parts of the world. Well signed and labelled. Spent a happy few hours exploring and also just sitting and reading and people watching. It helped that it was a warm sunny day but worth a visit whatever the weather for the magnificent trees
Don’t miss this,"We highly recommend this excursion. Jakobi is an excellent guide. He is so knowledgeable about the flora of the area. And we loved the stories he shared about his heritage. Australia has such a diverse number of plants, and Jakobi helped us understand what a big role they played in the lives of the indigenous people."
Cool and green,Relaxed gardens right in the city centre. Escape if a worker and escape into nature if in holiday. A rich mix of plants on gentle rolling lawns.
Superb!,"These gardens are nothing short of superb. So well maintained and beautifully clean. Everyone we saw there from families playing on the grass, couples walking or sunbathing etc seemed to respect their surroundings which are not spoiled by litter, graffiti, shouting. Just a lovely place to be and the specimens of flora are mind-blowing.If you're in Melbourne, don't miss this!"
Royal Botanic Gardens,"If you haven't visited The gardens, you haven't seen Melbourne. Ideal for everybody, easy access by all kinds of transport and by walk from the city centre."
Really educational!,"Quite extensive and natural environment with a lot of especies.We were eager to see the kangaroos and the kualas but they didn’t cooperate. We just saw one kuala sleeping on the tree and three kangaroos quite far way, resting on the shadow.Even so, it was worth the visit."
Wonderful!,The weather was great the gardens are stunning. A perfect day trip out. It wasn’t too busy you can just there to relax and take in all the scenery. Not to be missed if you’re in Melbourne.
Beautiful ,"Relaxing setting in central Melbourne, plenty to see such as Victoria's heritage, I enjoyed my walk."
Great for walks and picnics,The Royal Botanic Garden is beautiful. Absolutely amazing to spend a good relaxing time with friends or loved ones. They have a good eating place right in the middle of the garden.
Fantastic!!! A must visit attraction!!,Took a walk thru here as I love to garden and wanted some inspiration...Amazing to see this and is all free!Walked around the lake and sat on the grass relaxing..Such a peaceful place and plenty of shaded areas too.A great place to sit and read and generally relax.In the centre we dropped into the coffee shop for a well earned ice cream and cold drink..Splendid walk for around 90 minutes.Highly recommend.
Punting - a perfect pastime,"A visit to the Royal Botanical Gardens is a must and a great addition is to book yourself on a punt around the lake.It’s fun, relaxing and very informative. You can bring a bottle of your favourite wine/beer as you’re gently taken around the lake. Book in early to secure a spot as they do sell out!Once done, grab a bite or better yet, bring a picnic and enjoy the open spaces and beautiful gardens so close to the CBD!"
Wonderful part of Melbourne,The Botanic Gardens are beautifully maintained and visitors can picnic anywhere. Don’t forget to book a ride on the punt on the lake. Very tranquil with or without commentary by the punter. Second time enjoying the ride with overseas visitors. On first visit commentary was on history of Melbourne.  Second time it was about the vegetation and wildlife around the lake.  But I’m sure you could just enjoy the silence if you wish.
Hamlet in the botanic gardens,"Such a lovely evening in the Botanic gardens. We saw Hamlet live on stage and it was just lovely. We were visiting from Ireland and availed of the VIP ticket where we got a bottle of wine, seats and tickets which was great. There was so food options available too at reasonable prices. Overall it was a lovely night and would highly recommend it"
Beautiful oasis,So close to the centre and full of interesting plants and wonderful trees. A lovely relaxing place. Interesting herbarium too. Cafe charges extra on bank holidays!
Tranquility in Australia's busiest city,Botanic Parks are normally always lovely but this one was just bliss. You felt you had the park to yourself except when you were directing the lost to the tennis.
Peaceful,A little oasis  from the bustling city. You can even take a cooling punt around the lake. Lots of specimen trees and plants. A lovely couple of hours of peace.
Peaceful ,"Lovely way to spend a few hours away from the busy city. You can take a punt around the lake, stop for a cuppa or just relax on a bench. It’s not too big and offers a lot."
Large and elaborate gem,"You could spend all day here, there are many themed gardens.  The lakes are beautifully laid out.  We paired this with the Shrine of Remembrance museum."
Beautiful garden,We went there for sightseeing and shooting some photoes. It is a nice place for walk and being in the heart of the nature near the CBD of Melbourne.
Beautiful gardens,"We have been to serveral Botanic Gardens all over and the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Melbourne Gardens are very well kept and was a great place to walk. The girft shop was small but nice."
Beautiful Place,These lovely gardens may best be enjoyed with a guide for the first time.  There is much thought in how the gardens are laid out and interesting stories behind many of the plants and trees on display.  The cafe offers several nice options for lunch.
A Good Walk,"A good walk through the parks from Flinders Street and then a good - not great - Botanic Gardens.  The canna displays were splendid and the trees, lakes etc were good.  Have to say though personally my wife and I preferred the botanic gardens in St Kilda"
Garden Walk,"We checked in with the visitors center where they gave us a nice path to follow through the gardens. There is much to see, with a large diversity of flowers and plants to see."
"Lovely gardens, respite from the heat ",A great place to view a tremendous variety of plants and to hear and observe the wide variety of native birds. A lovely spot to escape the heat of the city.
Restful beauty in the heart of the city.,Wonderful well maintained gardens to stroll through in the heart of the city. Easily accessed with many wheelchair friendly paths. Many different types of vegetation on display. Plenty of shaded areas to hide away from the heat and lawned areas on which to rest. Always something different to see depending on the season. Well worth a visit.
Aboriginal walk,A fascinating 90 minutes which was partly about the plants and trees used by the indigenous peoples but also about respect for the land and the people. Very spiritual. Don't miss the fern valley and Gilfoyles volcano!
Amazing place,"What a stunning asset - beautiful to walk around and experience some incredible flora and fauna, as well as interesting wild life."
A well maintained park with lot of Flora & fauna,"Its a such a wonderful place if someone likes plants, trees, Flora & fauna..There are signs throughout the garden for pathway & Flora identification..I would suggest to spend a whole day., have a picnic as lot of shades available to sit & relax, enjoy the nature..And enter the park from main entrance & take a map along so that u don't miss anything..A bit difficult to get parking around on weekends.."
An absolutely amazing place to visit!,Please be sure to attend the free tour.  It was an excellent introduction to the gardens.  The tour guide was fantastic.
A great afternoon wandering about,"A lovely opportunity to relax and bimble about, hide under the shade of the trees and escape the sun, have a picnic and a nap by the lake 😁"
Heaven on earth,"I recently attended the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne with my son, just for a stroll and to satisfy a curiosity about this venue after having heard several favourable reports from other people.  For anyone who enjoys. peace, stunning beauty, magnificent floral arrangements and beautiful plants gardens and trees that almost defy description, this is one part of Melbourne that should not be missed.  It is easily, the most attractive and relaxing part of Melbourne and is top of the list for a ""must see"" venue.  Congratulations are in order for all the staff, engineers and management for creating and maintaining a wonderland of incredible beauty."
Pretty good for a walk,"If the weather is good, you wanna have a relaxed walk through the garden for sure. There are plenty of awesome plants to look at and also there are wild parrots to spot and take pictures. Not to forget the garden is pretty close to a lot of nice restaurants to end your evening with an awesome meal."
Superb free day out!,"These mature botanical gardens are a superb attraction and absolutely free! There are some planned attractions but just walking around at your own pace is a great pleasure. Some lovely scenic views are on offer. For the specialist there are some really interesting plant species but most will just want to look around the beautiful gardens. The tea rooms can get ridiculously busy, but its an ideal place to bring a picnic."
The gardens are expansive and beautiful.,We visited the gardens on a beautiful January day.  People were outside with dogs and friends and their children.  There was an outdoor play being boisterously performed by it’s players.  Trees are mature and healthy.  We loved the Fern Garden and Volcano Garden.  We had lunch at the Tea Garden (sorry if name is wrong).  Food was great.
Blown Away!,"I expected to spend ~30 min in the gardens walking around, but I could hardly pull myself away for my next engagement after 2 hours. It is so much bigger than I expected, winding paths with smaller offshoots. I would gladly get lost in these gardens, but the signs and maps have you on the right track.  No tour needed, just enjoy the tropical paradise inside the city."
City Oasis,"Every city in Australia seems to have Botanical Gardens but Melbourne's have to be the best. Check out the giant lily pad flowers in summer. Fern Gully is another highlight. Perfect location near the Yarra to explore the Shrine of Remembrance, gardens and then head to the Southbank. Moonlight Cinema in the gardens is a great evening out"
Guilfoyle's Volcano,"There is so much to see in the gardens, so I thought I would concentrate on the water supply pond known as Guilfoyle's Volcano.  It is a conical hill with a pond at the top.  It is surrounded by a succulent garden and the pond itself has water plants as well as some water birds.  It is in the South-East corner of the gardens near gate D"
Beautiful Gardens so close to the tennis,"We visited whilst play was delayed at the Australian Open. Tickets at the tennis allow you to leave and renter the grounds so we walked to the gardens. They are free, large , peaceful and varied. So beautiful! The cafe  is good too, especially sitting under its veranda watching the rain pour  whilst drinking tea."
Glorious Gardens,"A must if you like gardens,  we went on a beautiful sunny day.  Setting is astonishing.  Beautiful.  Would come many time over."
Enjoy Melbourne’s mini Central Park ,If you are visiting Melbourne or even having a staycation don’t forget to get out into the beautiful gardens close to the CBD. Finish off with a punt ride - so relaxing ...
Beautiful,"The gardens are lovely, very well maintained, quiet and peaceful. We had a bite to eat in the cafe by the lake and it was simple but tasty. Definitely going back to walk round it again."
Notable gardens in the city!,"If you like nature, walking or just need a break from the city the Royal Botanical Gardens can't be missed. We enjoyed it so much that we spent our whole afternoon here, and walked for miles. Very large, with a variety of green spaces,  big lawns for relaxing, shady trees to sit under, ponds with black swans, paths for running, large shady trees, and beautiful landscaped flowerbeds. The arid garden has cacti and other desert plants. And it's not all Australian plants here, either, they've greenery from all over the world.  Be there.... see for yourself how beautiful they are!"
Fun place to be ,"I love the Queen Vic Markets, all the colour, the food and the culture. Put this on your list It’s a must visit."
Absolutely Beautiful,What a wonderful way to spend a day in Sydney.  Everywhere you turn there is something so beautiful.  You can spend hours and not see it all.
Fantastic,Beautiful. We where there on a very hot day and there is lots of shade.  We had a lovely time here and really relaxing day.
Beatifult to place to take a stroll,It was a perfect day to a break from the busy city and take a stroll through magnificent gardens.  I highly recommend walking on the grass and smell the flowers as yo pass by.
"Bus tour, punting on the lake and exploring on foot","We had a full day on Boxing Day of exploring the Botanic Gardens with our young kids (aged 8 and 5). We all enjoyed the shuttle around the gardens with knowledgeable guide who pointed out so many interesting things, punting on the lake (we didn't book ahead so had to wait 2 hours on such a busy day), and exploring the gardens on foot. A big walking day and it was quite hot, but enough shady places to keep cool.I recommend taking your own food, snacks and water as the cafe on site is crazy expensive. We took everything with us, but paid top dollar for an ice cream treat for the kids. We didn't mind as the money clearly goes to the upkeep of the gardens and grounds."
A most enjoyable park,"Clean, quiet, very open.  Love the open spaces that Melbourne provides even though it is very urban.  This is a very family oriented park and it was nice to see many people enjoying.  Although there were many people I never felt I was in a crowd.  So much space."
Beautiful Water Lilly's in the botanical gardens,Huge Beautiful water Lilly's thriving in the beautifully landscaped lakes. Beautifully maintained and incredible foliage and trees
Peaceful paradise on city’s doorstep,"Once a month a friend and I meet at the Royal Botanic Gardens just over the river from the city centre. We enjoy the ever changing landscape of these world class gardens which are home to exotic species as well as native Australian plants. There are many paths to follow leading to ornamental lakes and groves of majestic trees. Particular favourites are Guilfoyle’s Volcano, a spectacular display of cacti and succulents, and the Tropical Hothouses."
Wonderful place!,There are no words to describe the beauty and magnificence of this amazin park. Do not miss it. Consider at least a couple of hours to spend there.
Tiny but beautiful!,Was much smaller than I expected but was beautiful.   Good place for pictures and very peaceful.   Highly recommend if you are in the area.
New Years Day in the Garden 2020,"Stopped in on New Years Day 2020. The park was full on a warm day. Many people had found spots under trees and by the lakes. It is a beautiful place to walk and stroll. We started by first visiting the war memorial across the street which is worthy of an hour's visit. The Gardens are a delight to walk through. We especially enjoyed walking by the lake, getting a coffee from the concession stand by the lake and seeing the boats float around on the lake. The grounds and plants were interesting and the view of the Melbourne sky line was good. Give this place 2-3 hours on your next visit to Melbourne. It is worth the time and the peach and relaxation it offers the visitor."
Beautiful Garden & Lawn Area,This landscaped location is a relatively short walk from the city via the riverside walk or adjoining parklands. A peaceful place to wander through or picnic on the lawns.
A lovely place to visit,A lovely place to visit!! So nice walking the botanical gardens!! You forget you are in the city.... nice spaces to sit and enjoy the nature. Some spots have amazing views of the city. Would definitely recomend a visit
"Sunny day, nowhere better!","My favourite place in Melbourne, pack a picnic, grab a book or simply go for a stroll with a coffee; nothing better."
Punting perfection,We had a wonderful meander through the Kings domain and the Royal Botanic Gardens Vic and came across the punting station down at the cafe. What a wonderful lazy way to recover from the long and hot walk by lazing back on the umbrella shaded punts with the expert commentary from our punter who drew attention to the wildlife along the lagoon and the history of its evolution. A very special experience well worth the money and then we had the energy to continue the rest of the way walking the winding paths around  the lush and lovely gardens.
Good place for morning stroll with your family to enjoy nature,"Brought my small family there on a beautiful sunny  and boy we had a good time. We actually planned for visit to the park and then to the Shrine of Remembrance as it's close together. There is a few trail/walkway that you can choose depending on the time you plan to spend there. Don't rush,  walk slowly, enjoy the nature, look at the scenery. Take it all in!!"
A Melbourne Treasure,"Have not been for a few years. Enjoyed every moment in the gardens. Well worth a visit, very relaxing."
Visiting the RBG is a Tonic,"Why we don't come here regularly is madness, as our 3  visits since Christmas have been uplifting. We get there early and park in Birdwood Avenue and purchase a parking ticket - up tp 4 hours.  As we enter the gardens (which are free to enjoy) we pick up a map, get our bearings, and decide which route to take. There are also brochures detailing the many events  held in the gardens -especially in the summer. We like to go through the delightful Fern Gully then make our way to the tea room - The Terrace - where we enjoy a coffee and a sandwich overlooking the stunning water lilies and watch the Gondolas punt passengers around the lake.  We also take our little dog with us; I think its his favourite place on earth.  Take along a couple of slices of bread and feed the ducks.  The gardens offer different displays such as the cactus around The Volcano, Chinese collection, Oaks, South African, Australian Forest walk and others.  They are all beautifully displayed and maintained as are the lawns and grounds in general.  The gardens are a relaxed and peaceful destination just a short distance from the CBD.  How clever were our forefathers to set aside and develop this wonderful area for nature. The RBG will definitely be on our agenda for regular visits throughout the year."
Lovely place,"It is a really nice place to walk. Trees and flowers are amazing in a peaceful and quiet place. Grab your camera, sneakers and go!"
Lovely family destination,"Visited the gardens with family members aged between 11 and 80 years old, and everyone  enjoyed the half day trip. We also loved the cafe next to the lake for our light lunch."
A day out,Good place to visit with the family. ...Close to Public transport..Good place to go for a nice walk....
Trish O’Loughlin,"Melbourne Botanical Gardens - Children’s Garden I visited this  garden, which is part of the wonderful Botanical Gardens last week. There was so much for the two children to explore and have creative fun that I had to bribe them to leave. They sailed  boats which they made from leaves and bark, climbed, ran and enjoyed every minute. Everyone there also seemed to be enjoying themselves as well."
OMG BEUT GARDENS,You need more than one day to explore these beautiful gardens. Definitely stop at the visitor centre for a map. You could get lost without one. From fern gullies to herb gardens there is something for everyone to appreciate. I transformed into a child in the children's garden. Such fun with all the meandering trails. Just duck down in places - it is for little people. You don't even know you are in the near the centre of the city.  It feels like you are on a bush walk.
Beautiful Garden and relaxing stroll,"Visited the botanical garden during our stay in Sydney and it was a very pleasant stroll with many things to see.  It doesn’t cost anything to walk around and view, so there’s no need to spend money on a tour.  Great views of the opera house, and so many plants, trees, and wildlife.  There were lots of cockatoos just walking on the grass as well which was very cool.  I would say you can spend about 1-2 hours walking around as there are many great photo ops."
"Huge, serene, fabulous for amazing walks, quiet and beauty.","It's just south of the CBD so really, in the city, which makes it easy to get to from either the downtown or the areas south.  It's a huge oasis offering whatever you're looking for with respect to nature and gardens.  Lots of wonderful programs are offered as well including Shakespeare in the Park, (Wind in the Willows is performed for kids and families, Hamlet for adults in the evenings).  The Meditative Forest Walk is well worthwhile for grown-ups; quite magical.  Don't miss a visit starting with the beautiful Visitor's Centre where you can get the info you need to explore the park in the way you choose."
Lovely,Spent a lovely day wandering the gardens. Had a spot of lunch by the lake and loved the Greenhouses.
Guided walk for Kiwi visitors,We loved our 90 minute guided walk with a superb guide and the gardens were breathtaking. It was great to spot some dedicated NZ plants and trees amongst the vast array of both Australian and exotic species.
Lovely gardens,"Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria is a beautiful place. Not the most beautiful one we have ever seen. If the day is not too hot, I would recommend spending few hours there"
Visit the shrine,Beautiful and well kept..the shrine is free and has interesting War stuff for kids. Gardens are good for morning walks
Hokiday,A tranquil and calming experience worth a visit whilst staying in Melbourne. The orchid garden is definitely worth paying for and to walk round for an hour or two.
Nice Freebie,"This is one of the few Botanical Gardes that's admission free, i.e. it doesn't cost a penny and provides plenty for the eye"
One of the best Botanic Gardens in the world,"The Botanic Gardens are a must for any visitor to Melbourne. Lush, serene, beautiful- a perfect escape from the bustle of the city. The lake at the center is a must. Pack a picnic and enjoy this spectacular setting."
Beautiful for an afternoon stroll,"The walk around the lake is really nice, hard to remember you’re in the middle of the city! Bring a camera!"
The best gardens in the world,I just love walking through theses gardens. They are nothing short of extraordinary. Great information to read and learn about the history and the plants/trees/shrubs. A must to visit.
The most beautiful gardens,"Anyone who lives in Melbourne or visits Melb and doesn't spend time in these gardens is missing one of the best gardens in the world and a real treasure for the city.Give yourself time, take a book and enjoy the full garden experience."
Amazing place,"So much to see, the variety of plants is incredible. Very well maintained and easy to navigate. Highly recommend."
Lovely for a stroll or to sit and relax,"Very well kept gardens, lovely for a walk around or to sit and read / relax. Take water and sun cream"
Enjoy the walk with lovely surroundings,Free parking during public holidays around the Botanic Gardens. Always a lovely place to visit. The park is huge and takes a while to explore all the sections. A must visit.
LOVE THIS PLACE!,"Gorgeous and varied and peaceful, delightful restaurant, amazing Gardens. Love the massive lily ponds. Love the rain forest walk. Thought I was listening to construction workers banging on pipes when I first heard the bell bird, sounds much better now."
Nice spot for morning walk,"During very hot day at the end of  December, it’s nice to do morning walk in Royal Botanical Garden... Enjoy the very nice scenery also to protect our body from the heat"
"Big, beautiful and peaceful","Very beautiful, big botanic gardens with lots of places to rest, read or have a picnic. Very peaceful. Beautiful lake, different types of plants, lots of things to see. Clean facilities."
Stunning,"These gardens are absolutely beautiful whether seen on foot or via the Explorer. The latter also provides interesting commentary and just an enjoyable ride round. I love this place so much. It's peaceful and serene with an awesome palette of colour during the summer - flowers, plants and birds. A must for locals and tourists. I can easily spend a whole day here."
Peaceful ,"Nice and relaxing place to visit. Although read about the steep prices in the cafe forgot to bring food. You only forget once, prices are well and truly horrendous. Walked back to the city via King's and Victoria gardens. Well worth it!"
Beautiful Garden,"What a treat!!! Stunning and huge garden in the middle of the city!!!!! A must visit!! Lots of interesting feature gardens and a beautiful lake you can have a gondola ride on! We visited with our kids, a great walk from one end to the other"
Christmas Carols ,Lovely to walk through the beautifully well maintained Royal Botanical Gardens on way to /from the Carols. I have spent some time at the gardens on previous visits. Always a delight especially the fragrant roses.
Lovely,"Great place to sit and be quiet in a busy city,the grace is well maintained but its mostly trees with a pond not much else worth a visit."
Beautiful Gardens,"The Gardens are easily accessibly from the CDB by tram or by walking. They are adjacent to two other gardens but cover a much larger area. There are lots of areas for picnicking, a tea house, a shop, plenty of toilets and other sites. More significantly, though, the gardens themselves are gorgeous and full of specialty areas such as the fern garden and a specially designed children’s garden. We walked for a couple of hours stopping occasionally at conveniently placed benches. There were a lot of people out but it didn’t feel crowded. If you enjoy some time outdoors for exercise or relaxation it’s a great spot out of the bustle of the business district."
Absolutely beautiful,An evening stroll through gardens - an oasis in the middle of the city. Spend some time walking through this wonderful gem of a park.
Free Walking Tour with Guide Virginia was the BEST!,"We have a LOVELY guided free walking tour of Melbourne Botanical Gardens! Virginia, the guide, is a Master Gardener (apparently she hosts a radio show and is a local celebrity in gardening circles). She is amazing in her knowledge and welcoming spirit. We learned SO MUCH and she was patient with all the photo takers. We heard the bell birds that sing bell chimes. When Virginia realized that several of us were particularly interested in seeing birds she made a point of finding them and teaching us about them as well as the plants. This was one of our top experiences in Melbourne!"
Beautiful place and amazing birds,I used to live in Australia and miss the parrots.  You can find them here!  Beautiful gardens where it's great to walk around and the birds are everywhere.  Heard many kookaburras too!  Really exceptional place to just walk around and enjoy.
Lovely walk through the gardens,Really enjoyed the walk through the gardens. Highly recommend grabbing a water bottle with you! Really peaceful and there is plenty of shade if you need an escape from the sun. It can get hot so I recommend checking the weather in advance. We saw several kinds of parrots throughout the park.
Gorgeous Place,"A little piece of heaven on a hot December day can be found here.  Stroll thru the foliage and vines on well-defined paths, marvel at the blooming flowers.  Forget that you're in a big city.  Relax and breathe.  Book an indigenous guide to explain the flora you're standing in front of."
The best of Melbourne ,"I have so many memories here. From high school, moonlight cinema, picnics, parties, proposing to my wife. And such a beautiful setting."
An excellent location to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city,"After a difficult time trying to find parking (eventually we found one of the rare free parking bays).  We took a leisurely stroll through some areas inside the gardens.At the time of year that we visited, there were not a lot of flowers in bloom but it did not detract from the calm that prevailed in the gardens.There are some nice touches here now, which (some for a price) you can indulge in, including: - being driven around the gardens in a small open bus (ideal for people with mobility issues).- sitting in a pontoon on the lake, being propelled through the water by an oarsperson (similar to a gondolier).  This was not cheap @ $25 per person.- join in the (free) guided walking tour of the gardens, which leave from the main entry at regular intervals.The only negative comment I have is about the food on offer.  We went to the main cafe for something to eat.  There was a very limited selection of food available and the prices (for the primarily captive audience), were exceptionally high.My recommendation is that you get public transport here (it's a lot less stressful) and bring something to eat and drink, especially if you have young ones (their desired food may not be available).Would we return here?  Yes, at a different time of year (perhaps in the autumn) and with our picnic hamper."
Beautiful Garden to walk through,Really enjoyed walking through this Garden. Very beautiful. Didn't get to spend as much time as would like to have. But a must see when in Melbourne.
Lush. ,Simply lush. Spent the afternoon wondering round and then took the path by the river back into the city. What a glorious garden to have so close to the hustle and bustle of the city. Would 100% recommend for some peace and quiet! Lovely!
Accessible and peaceful,My mum was unwell and unable to walk long distances so we were able to push her around in a wheelchair on bitumen paths so she could enjoy the splendour of the gardens.
Peaceful gardens ,We drove here and parked on the street for 4 hours which was just enough to walk around the gardens and enjoy lunch at the restaurant.We all enjoyed the morning and will visit again.
peaceful,"peaceful and informative, nice walks and lovely heaven of nature in the city. not overly busy unless the suns out"
Great way to escape hustle and bustle,"If you have a couple of hours to spare, visit the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens. The paths are an easy walk and you can spend as little or as long as you want to there. The gardens are stunning and each section brings a new surprise. The gondola on the lake was my favourite."
A great place for a walkinto and picnic. ,"These gardens are a wonderful asset for Melbourne. Over 100 years old it has a wide range of flora and some fauna. It even has a childtens garden, plus a cactus area. Rolling grass areas provide a marvellous area for picnics and for children to run and tumble. Close by are several cafes and coffee  drinks."
Watched a movie under the stars!,"It was an amazing movie watching experience! The ambiance, food, people all were so good. It was a perfect anniversary gift to my husband :)"
Amazing beauty and peace,"These gardens were truly beautiful.  We could have spent days there.  Very season must be different so if you are local it would be a great place to visit throughout the year. Lovely place to walk, talk and enjoy the beauty of creation!"
Absolutely Stunning!,Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne are so stunning The Plants The Flowers The Birds make this a beautiful relaxing day! It is so quiet if you are looking for piece and serenity.
"Beautiful, massive and well worth your time.","We visited here on our last day in Melbourne, visiting the Shrine of Rememberance before moving over to the Botanical Gardens (5mins walk from one another). My wife and I were amazed at not only how big it was but also how varied andclean it was. There are many parts to it including the Jungle Walk, the different gardens and the lake. Everytime we walked around the corner we said ""wow"".If youve got time for a stroll we took around 2-3 hours here not including a bit of lunch at the restaurant.Note.If you get a pot of tea it will be more than sufficient for 2 of you."
BEAUTIFUL,"There are of course plenty of Botanic Gardens, but this one really makes you feel good.  Beautiful flora from all points of the World and even some from here in Aussie.  A great place to enjoy the better things in life. Don't miss it."
Return visit as promised and well worth it.,"Came her on our first visit to Melbourne in 2016, and the memories came flooding back as to how good it was. It it a superb place to visit, but make sure you pick up a complimentary map. It's a full day to see all the garden and thoroughly enjoyable."
Always worth a visit,"Try to visit the gardens whenever we visit Melbourne from the Uk.A great way to spend a few hours, always ending up at the Observatory cafe for refeshments."
We did the $10 per person 30 minute bus ride and it was great,We did the $10 per person 30 minute bus ride and it was great.  Amazing gardens. Looks like a great place for weddings.
Wort seeing,"We had a lovely time here, there was so much to see.  It is kept immaculate and so many different parts to it.  It had been very well landscaped"
A well laid out garden,"Free to visit like most Australian botanic gardens. It’s a short tram ride from the centre. A map shows the different types of trees, shrubs and flowers native to Australia. My favourite was the fern gully - having spent some time in the rain forest, I can confirm it is very authentic.  Good coffee and cakes!"
Beautiful tranquil space,"A gorgeous, green park full of interesting plants and trees. Fabulous place just to walk around and explore"
Perfect for everyone!,"My dad, my good friend and 1 went on a garden explorer ride at the Royal Botanical Garden. It was the perfect decision. It was not too tiring for my 81year old dad and we get to see so much of the flora and fauna, plus informative commentary from the guide. Really worth the AUD10 per person for the 25min ride."
"BEAUTIFUL, QUIET GARDENS","The Royal Botanic Gardens are a peaceful, welcome change from the noise and bustle of the city. I understand there is a significant link with Indigenous People and various activities available. Some research before you travel will enhance your visit."
Great way to spend a beautiful day in Melbourne,"We visited the day we arrived as we wanted to walk and enjoy what turned out to be a beautiful day. You can spend an hour or two here or you could spend the entire day. We spend several hours walking around the gardens and admiring all the flowers and trees. The volcano is a must see and you get great views from that part of the garden. But if you take the map they provide you can decide for yourself what you want to do and how long you want to stay.I’ve been to several Botanic Gardens (London, Naples) and this one holds it’s own with both of those. It can be a bit of a walk and there are several areas where you are going uphill. Something to keep in mind if you have older folks in your group.If you could only do one thing in Melbourne it may not be this but it certainly makes the top 5 list of things to do, and it’s a great way to get some exercise."
An Aboriginal talk set in beautiful gardens,"We had most lovely time at the botanical gardens. Den our guide on the walk was informative and had a great sense of humour. He told us a great deal about the aboriginal people, their customs and their history. The gardens are so beautifully landscaped, they are definitely Melbournes top attraction."
Just so beautiful,A great place to stroll through on the way back from the Basketball to St Kilda rd. So peaceful. What a pleasure to live in greenery again and hear birds. Shame the Tea House was closed for a wedding though!
"Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.","A little way out and a long walk from the main shops, the Gardens are found some distance from Federation Square, near St. Paul's Cathderal. The Gardens start at the Remembrance Shrine, and have many magnificent specimen trees, borders and well kept walks."
Lovely way to spend an afternoon,"Expansive botanic garden in central Melbourne.   Makes for a wonderful way to spend a nice afternoon.  I actually preferred the gardens in Sydney as they had more ""blooming"" plants but the Melbourne park was excellent as well."
Must-see in Melbourne,"The gardens are huge and absolutely beautiful. Tops the list among other botanical gardens around the world - massive open park with loada of different areas, lake, places to sit and relax, and just enjoy some quite time away from the city. Definitely visit the Fern walk."
Stunning gardens ,"The gardens are absolutely immaculate , the gardens are huge so make this a whole day trip because there is just so much too explore . There's also a cute cafe and many resting stops to sit down and take in the gorgeous views ♥️"
Beauty and Variety ,"The Gardens provides an interesting and varied layout with an extensive variety of plants and vegetation. The small lakes, ponds, gentle slopes and meandering paths provide a great place to wander and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors."
A million dollar experience. ,"I was staying only 75 metres from The Tan, a running/walking/cycling/ambling/strollering (lots of babies in strollers!) track that goes all around the outside of these gardens.  So I walked it twice daily for five blissful days, that’s 3.82 km times two.  It’s a fantastic, wide path with fine gravel, level almost all the way except for a short hilly stretch along Anderson St South Yarra.  There’s plenty of room for everyone and I didn’t feel I was in the way of the fast runners and rapid joggers.  Everyone’s very courteous.  You pass from leafy urban greenery and avenues near St Kilda Road and alongside the Yarra River to the National Gallery of Victoria and the city itself.  There can be no more idyllic way to approach and then to pass by inner Melbourne."
Lovely afternoon or morning walk with the family!,The Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne are beautifully maintained and lovely for a walk with the family. Myself and wife and 2 kids (7 and 9) walked to the gardens from the CBD (about 10 to 15 mins walk) and spent a couple of hours wandering around. There is a little shop and snack bar by the entrance and a bigger cafe / restaurant near the lake. Kids enjoyed the outdoor space. Would definitely recommend!
A stroll in a big park,Melbourne's Royal Botanic Garden has a lot of attractions in their greenhouses and garden. Be prepared to spend a few hours exploring this garden.
The Central Park of Melbourne ,"Beautiful garden/park with a wide range of flora which overlooks the Yarra river, would recommend fellow joggers to take a morning jog along the riverbank, the view is just stunning."
Beautiful day ,We walked over the yarra towards the gardens for a nice day out in Melbourne. Make your way up the shrine of remembrance for great city views.Multiple cafes throughout and an expanding range of displays. The Australian Forrest wall and fern gully were highlights.
A beautiful place to visit,"A great place to run, walk or simply relax . It has good facilities, with areas with specific trees or plants from around the world.   A lovely green place close to the city and well worth a visit.  A good place for birds too."
Cute,These gardens are beautiful and are definitely worth a visit. The large gardens are a great place for a picnic
Great place to visit,We had a great day out at the botanic gardens. Definitely worth it and its free. The shrine is also close by
Beautiful way to spend an afternoon,"It's a great place to go running, or to bring a sketchpad and draw flora, to read out on a blanket... really take your pick.  :)"
Lovely walk and lunch,We had a pleasant walk through the gardens then enjoyed a light lunch overlooking the lake. It was a beautiful way to spend a couple of hours.
extensive gardens with a variety of plant environments,"Close to the heart of the city, the Botanic Gardens are large with a myriad of winding paths curling their way around it. There are tours and education resources for children, but it's a pleasure just to wander through them. It is hilly in parts so visitors with limited mobility might find it challenging to get around."
Beautiful ,"Very beautiful gardens, I had left my phone in hotel so couldn’t take any photos. Loads of different type of gardens to visit. If it’s a hot day , plenty of sun screen as very very little shade. Great day out with a picnic"
Relaxing,"We ambled, sat, smelled our way around the gardens the grounds are well maintained tidy and a lovely way to relax in nature in the middle of a noisy city. Recommended for a few peaceful hours."
Great garden with many beautiful flora in the middle of the city!,Super nice botanical garden with many different trees and flowers. It's a great breathing room in the middle of the city.My favorite was the black swans which I had never seen before!
Very pleasant ....,"We had a lovely walk round these gardens,  not a huge amount to say other than it’s all very pretty and and a welcome break fRon the city.   Coffee was excellent but then when isn’t it in Melbourne ... 🤷‍♂️"
My favourite place in Melbourne,"As the title of my review suggests, this is really a beautiful place. Imagine thousands of different and wonderful plants from all over the world all gathered next to each others in this impressive Garden. Must see!"
"Beautiful, tranquil and quiet","A walk around at any time of year is so good. Spring, and daffodils blooming in the lawns, plus all the flowering bushes. I always really enjoy the Cactus garden then finish with a walk down to the lake and a cup of coffee there. Can't beat greenery in any city!"
Nice peaceful place ,Very pleasant for a quiet walk away from the hustle and bustle of Melbourne. A short walk across the river to Freedom Square. Well worth a visit.
Beautiful,Such a peaceful and lovely walk around the gardens. Then inside for a bite to eat and a lovely gift shop.
Nice for a walk atound,Nice place to have a walk around some greenery just outside the CBD. Great to see the various types of plants here in Aus and it’s clearly very well looked after!
So much to explore,"Great for a casual walk with the pram, stopped into The Terrace cafe for scones, even on a hot summer day there was plenty of space inside and aircon. The children's garden is a little hot spot, however it is closed Monday and Tuesdays during the school term. There's so much to explore so make sure you've got a free day and take a picnic!"
A rare oasis in the midst of a great city,"The Royal Botanical Gardens embodies the history of Melbourne, but it is more than that: it is beautiful. A world-class garden. For me, the treasure was finding the tree planted by His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie during his State Visit in 1968; a tree now grown to full maturity and visited as a touchstone by local Ethiopian-Australians. And next to it is a tree, freshly-planted in 2017 by the Emperor's Grandson, His Imperial HIghness Prince Ermias Sahle-Selassie Haile-Selassie, making a Commemorative Visit to Australia, re-tracing the Emperor's steps. And he used the same silver spade the Emperor had used to turn the first sod of earth to plant the new tree, and then was presented with a second silver spade, with his own name on it, to complete the task. Both are now in the Gardens' museum. Wonderful, knowledgeable staff; tranquil, inspiring surroundings. A real reason to visit Melbourne."
Garden walk,Beautiful gardens lots to see well worth a visit. Ice cream expensive !! Lots of interesting little paths  and plants to see. Birds fascinating.
Walk around the Botanical Gardens,"Very enjoyable walk around the gardens.  Lot of signage to help understand the plants.  Recommend as a ""fair weather"" attraction.  Cafeteria on site was fast and reasonable."
Nature around,"I wanted to find some nature in the middle of the city and I found this place. It has been an amazing experience because the place is huge, you can enjoy an afternoon picnic with your friends while you enjoy of the beautiful days in Melbourne. There are so many kind of trees and flowers of the nature lovers"
Stunning!,Victoria must have experienced rain and sunshine to put on such a fabulous display of an assortment of flora.Everything was in flower.We walked the entire gardens and spent quite some time here.
Tins,Definitely it is worthy to see! Amazing collection of many different plants species and birds. You can easy take a rest on one of the benches an admire Beautiy of the nature.
Walk through the garden ,"The gardens are beautifully maintained. The walk around is cool with plenty of shade options.I loved that throughout there were little signs for every plant showing both the scientific name and general name.We we’re lucky enough to see a family of black swans, they were very cute. Awesome spot to bring a picnic lunch or for anyone that loves horticulture."
Stunning gardens,"Free ark to wonder around. Amazing flowers, cute wildlife. Well kept. Also a nice cafe if you get peckish."
Beautiful Gardens and Birdlife,What an oasis in the middle of a big city.  We spent several relaxing hours on a weekday morning in early October.
Beautiful place to walk and explore,"These are beautiful gardens spread across a large area along the river. Lots' to see, or just a nice area for a quiet walk."
just wow!!,"Breathtaking Park, must Visit!! In the middle of Melbourne you can find a bit of garden Eden with exceptional Plants and Trees, beautiful Lake, Birds , Swans and much more to Visit.There is a nice  Coffee shop to take a bit rest, take your time to enjoy it."
Do the free garden tour instead,Despite the efforts of the volunteer guide I got very little value from the $18. Learnt nothing extra from popping into the observatory and herbarium. And had to put up with the others on tour who were uninterested.   Just do the free tour.
Botanical garden lunch and punt boat ride,"Most beautiful gardens with many Australian natives, a lake including delightful birdlife & flora with a punter poling us explaining history of the gardens."
Always good to go back to,"I probably visited it more than any other place in Melbourne.  All parks in metro area are good, this one is more than just a park."
Beautiful garden,A must to see and spend “me time “specially on a sunny day. You can bring a book to read and relax or just have a stroll looking at the beautiful scenery.
Exciting and educational ,"Had one of the best tours this Wednesday afternoon at Royal botanical gardens in Melbourne. The tour guide was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the plants that grow in the garden. She also provides interesting trivia of each plant and she also knows the scientific names of most Australian plants that are grown there!! Although the biggest let down in the tour was the limited time inside the herbarium. Regardless my experience around the botanical gardens was mesmerising, I particularly liked the small lakes and the well vegetated cover in the Fern Gully."
Excellent gardens supported by friendly knowledgeable staff.,We had an afternoon here and used the 30min shuttle tour which enabled us to appreciate the natural flora of this area in great detail and  together with information regarding introduced plant species during Victorian times made the visit thoroughly enjoyable. We shall return to spend more time here very soon!
A great place to visit whilst in Melbourne ,"The weather really turned it on for our visit to the Royal Botanical Gardens. It took about 20 minutes by tram from our CBD Hotel and it should be noted it is outside the ""free  fare"" zone for the trams so one should ensure that they have their tram cards topped up if planning to visit by this mode. We found the gardens took a bit of time to find if following Google maps as you have to first go past the Shrine of Remembrance (of course we had to go in as well 🙂) but found there weren't any directions outside leading the Royal Botanical Gardens. Once there though, we found the Gardens a delight to stroll through, stopping first for a coffee and a browse through their Visitor Centre and Gift shop."
Amazing park and it's free,"If you love nature with trees, lake and peaceful space...you must visit this park!The most beautiful park in Melbourne.Save 2 hours or more to enjoy every walk in there."
Trees!!,Absolutely amazed at the variety of tree and other plants throughout the gardens! Stubborn kookaburra would not make a sound but did pose for several photos and a video. Thoroughly enjoyed the walk in the park feeling and found the cafeteria at just the right time. Food and drink were good quality and reasonable in price. Highly recommended
Weekend visit,Visited here and walked around these gardens very beautiful and peaceful. Easy walk and well worth visiting.
Beautiful,This was a beautiful garden with amazing flowers and birds. Our tour just spent a short time there so we went back on our free afternoon.
Great Time,"If you are interested in plants and a nice walk, these gardens are excellent. The bird watching is also quite good. Admission is free and the downtown core is about 15 minutes away by foot."
So beautiful.,"A peaceful release from the busy CBD, visit the hot house tropical shed while your there. The cafe does DELICIOUS cakes and slices and excellent coffee."
relax and unwind in the park,"Short walk from Southbank and Flinders station this is a wonderful garden. Melbourne is famous for its gardens. The Melbourne botanical garden is surrounded by other parks and the Yarra river. Great for families to relax and unwind,or for those who are into meditation & contemplation.And of course garden enthusiasts!I highly recommend a walk in the botanical gardens in Melbourne."
Beautiful ,Loved the Botanic Gardens.  Very peaceful and well laid out.  Many beautiful plants and flowers.  Nice cafe with good selection of food.Definitely worth a visit.
Lovely gardens ,This is such a lovely garden area to go for a stroll. Lots of birds and a wonderful little gift shop.
Perfect gardens - tranquil and beautiful.,"First visit to the gardens and will add to must-do list for Melbourne. Easily walkable from the CBD and a paradise of interesting gardens, ponds and a couple of eating options.  Just lovely."
Beautiful,Plants from all around the world are on display. I especially liked the gnarly trees. Great place for a family outing.
Garden visit with family,"Really interesting visit to Cranbourne gardens. We had a lovely wander around beautiful plants and trees. We especially liked the layout and the café, plus the shop"
Stunning gardens,We were lucky to visit during a quiet weekday morning. Perhaps the experience isn’t the same on a weekend I can imagine. We went in gate A which is the nearest entrance to the lake. Spent one hour wondering around. Superb.
Picturesque,"The Botanical gardens is the jewel in the crown. Stunning floral displays and many other gardens within the garden. Come and amble through the stunning flora on offer and don’t forget the clock,! You’ll know what I mean, if you go. Enjoy."
A slice of Heaven,We stayed a short walk from the Royal Botanical Gardens and were glad we took the time to explore. Everything was so beautiful and well maintained. So many of the plants were super huge so had been established for a long time. We were surprised that such a beautiful park was free to enter. I would wander this park frequently if I lived in Melbourne. A must do for any outdoor or plant enthusiast.
The picturesque Botanic Gardens,The ambience of the gardens next to the Yarra River is second to none. Grab a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine and find a spot surrounded by the most beautiful garden setting. From Rainforests to ferneries the variety of plants/gardens is amazing.
A must to visit! ,A must to visit when you are in Melbourne! The Gardens is beautifully designed and cleverly manicured. There's plenty of shaded areas and a section especially for the kids. Highly recommended!
"Walk, relax, recover",Very nice place just to walk and unwind. We went down various paths and the gardens were well kept. Ate at the kiosk near Jardin Tan and had a great vegetarian roll.
Stunning,"Came here on my first day in Melbourne and loved it. The guys clearly take pride in there work, very well maintained"
Loved it!,I really enjoyed this experience. Our guide was Jakobi and he was very knowledgeable and informative about the various uses of the endemic plants in the region. I felt like I learnt a lot while strolling through a beautiful garden setting.
Lovely Garden in the City,"A nice walk - with or without a guide.  After a few hours at the National Gallery, it was nice to have a little walk through nature and enjoy some sunshine.  Easy walk on even terrain."
Beautiful gardens,"Lovely visit, helped by beautiful weather.  Great to wander round for an hour or so after the business of the city"
beautiful,"This is so beautiful to visit, I aways forget and i could go everyday, a definite must c in Melbourne"
An absolutely stunning place,"The gardens are one of the most beautiful I have ever visited. A great place to learn something new, to have a picnic, to rest, to do souvenir shopping, to take stunning photos."
Beautiful Gardens,"The Botanical Gardens are really lovely, especially if you get to visit on a sunny day. The lawns and flowers are well looked after and sitting on the grass near the lake is just delightful. Fantastic photo opportunities. You can even go punting for a fee. Easy walk from the city centre. Nearby is the Shrine of Remembrance."
Interesting and enjoyable,"Jakobi our guide was really informative and engaging as he escorted our group around the gardens, describing many of the plants we came across and their use and symbolism within Aboriginal cultures."
Food for thought,"The Aboriginal Heritage Walk with guide Jakobi, was very informative and enjoyable. A good mix of insights into Aboriginal culture/history and a leisurely walk through the gardens noting the significant trees and plants and what these trees plants offer in regard to food, tools and general items.It was also interesting to gain an understanding of the impact of European plantings and the water required to sustain these trees and plants.The smoking ceremony was an important part of the walk providing a deeper appreciation of Aboriginal culture.It was such a pleasure to walk around this beautiful environment, thank you JacobiI have attached a photograph of a magnificent gum tree, in the tree is a cockatoo protecting it young"
Excellent tour with Jakobi,I thoroughly enjoyed our 1.5-hour tour. We were able to sample some of the indigenous plants (mint and lemon myrtle) and learnt all about their various uses. Our guide Jakobi was very knowledgeable and encouraged questions and discussion from the group. It was also interesting to hear about the impact of climate change and how RBG are trying to manage this. Thank you Jakobi. Highly recommend!
Very interesting tour with Jakobi,Jakobi was an enthusiastic tour guide with a good understanding of the plants and their in Aboriginal society. The smoking ceremony was also very interesting.
Great Day Out,The Gardens is a really nice day out - it doesn't matter if you are just by yourself or with friends or family. Great walking tracks - easy parking and easy to get to by public transport. There is an excellent cafe in the center - good food and drink at reasonable prices and a gift shop if you are looking for that sort of thing. You can easily spend a few hours there.
Hot day to be in the garden ,"A new girlfriend who likes botanical gardens, so off to the Botanical Gardens we go. My last memories of the place were vague and uninspiring. So, imagine my surprise as the gardens revealed so many themed locations and restful stops. Every 100 metres or so you could stop and enjoy the delights of that area. Intense greenery of subtle lawns and trees  plus a well priced kiosk and gift shop near the small lake. It may have been my charming company, but this oasis in the hustle and bustle of Melbourne was silent and peaceful. Time became an afterthought as the gardens relaxed and soothed the heart and soul. This feeling was most welcome and I will return again this summer with friends, family or alone to the Royal Botanical Gardens."
The. OST beautiful gardens ever!,"I make a point to visit the botanical gardens wherever I travel, the gardens in Melbourne are the most amazing I’ve ever seen.  There are so many species of plants, I could spend days there!"
The birds in the trees will keep you amused,Beautiful gardens that are well maintained and a perfect stroll after a very long flight. The selection of plants and flowers will blow you away
Fabulous garden,Spent a relaxing few hours walking through this beautiful garden. Much to see in a well maintained  garden.
Nice walk,"Nice gardens. Shame it isn’t open 24 hours. I was up early and had to wait for ages until they opened the gates. But once inside, it was a nice experience."
Pretty place to walk,We chose to get a taxi to the botanical gardens before heading over to Southbank area. They cover a fairly large area so be prepared for a lot of walking if you want to see it all! They were pretty without being as exceptional as we’d hoped. Still worth the time to go around though!
Gorgeous,"Such a great day, perfect for all visitors. Clean and pretty. Take a picnic and relax. Highly recconend"
Beautiful!! Can walk and observe for hours..,You can follow the track / paths around and around for hours..There is so much to see and so many different areas to exploresPlants from all around the world in there only little areas.. a couple of lakes which are stunning.. Photo op galore!! Great scenery to relax and enjoy the serenityCoukd go again and again..
Beautiful ,This one should not be missed if you love nature and are interested in plants and flowers photography. The park itself is very beautifully designed and well maintained with many birds. A good place for bird watching.
Delightful Day out,A lovely place to visit and enjoy the plants and ambience.A cafe is situated next to the lake for food and drinks.Highly recommend a visit here
Take a picnic,"For a relaxing, cheap day out, visit the Botanic Gardens. Take a picnic and a blanket and enjoy a lovely break in the heart of Melbourne."
Lovely place to get away from busy Melbourne ,Want a very relaxed relaxed stroll and learn about plants ( if you like) visit the Botanical gardens. You can go on the main paved paths easily but if you bother to take the small side walks you get to experience smells and feels of different environments. So look for those hidden corners and enjoyAlso take a camera there are a lot of photo opportunities
Beautiful oasis in the city,"I loved visiting the Botanic Garden. After busy days of sightseeing, this was a nice break, but also interesting and informative."
Huge beautiful place,"A huge place full of beautiful vegetation: trees, flowers, shrubs and more and more. Excellently kept and arranged. A place to spend at least half part of the day."
Beautiful and relaxing spot in the middle of bustling Melbourne,"I would recommend that you spend a peaceful, unhurried day in the Gardens as there are so many flora and faunas to enjoy and so many choices of relaxing spot. If you are in CBD, you can take the tram no 58 and alight at Fawkner Park. Walk for 500 m and you can enter at Gate D. There are 2 souvenir shops inside the park, and the tea towels of the flowers makes really gorgeous souvenirs to bring back home. If you are up to it, continue further until the Shrine of Remembrance"
Feel the serenity,"Feeling anxious, need some time out well take your water bottle and wander quietly through the gardens. There are so many places to sit and ponder, stretch or wander. Best on a sunny day but lovely in the rain with an umbrella."
Nice for relax,The place very big a lot of differnt flowersTo seat near the lakeTo take gondola for short rideCoffee shop realy nice to seat near the lake
Lovely!,"Really nice gardens, with access to the remembrance shrine which is really worth a visit. Lovely gardens."
Met Den,A walk with den through this delightful place with his insights relative to the gardens as well as the indigenous peoples of Australia
Half day Melbourne tour.,"Lovely freindly tour with grayline tours informative  guide  botanical gardens, brighton bathing boxes,st kilda area and river cruise ,lots to see and do lovely city ,freindly people."
Beautiful Place!,Had my introduction to all of the beautiful plants Australia has at the RBG Victoria.  Absolutely stunning and very diverse.  Great place to walk on a gorgeous spring day!
Beautiful Gardens and Walks,"Entered from Anderson Street and then meandered to the Tea Room.  The gardens were beautiful on this cool sunny day in September.  There is good signage, lovely plantings, and so clean.  The Tea Room was quiet on this Monday morning so there was plenty of seating both indoors and out.  We relaxed with cappuccinos and shared a delicious muffin.  We continued walking to the other side of the park to arrive near the National Gallery of Victoria.  It was nice that there numerous benches to rest, relax, and enjoy this lovely garde."
A royal gem,This was our first visit to these gardens. I was surprised to see such large mature parkland so close to the city. We were lucky that the weather was superb and the spring flowers in bloom. Couples and families were out enjoying themselves. We will return when we have more time.
Beautiful place ,"It is a gorgeous place to hide from the city. It has a lovely tour through the lake in a gondola. The tea room serves lots more than just tea, including lunch options, ice cream, wines. Lots of place to run and watch birds."
Den was a great leader,"Den was informative about the indigenous plants and gave some history about the people and the land I didn’t otherwise know. He was a tad gruff, cheeky and fun and happy to answer questions at the end about a rather sad history"
Excellent tour with Den!,"A wonderful tour led by heart warming Den. Learned about plant history in the context of Aboriginal Australia but mainly about strength, forgiveness, listening and understanding. Everyone should do this."
"Peaceful, calm, nature","The Royal Botanic Garden is a beautiful peace of heaven that attracts people from different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities. There is a lot to do ; walking, picnic, running, relaxing, family gatherings and much more.  I highly recommend this place for those who are looking to relax and get in touch with nature"
