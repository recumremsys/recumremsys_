Markets,Worth a visit to the markets. Buy some tasty local food to take home. Sit and enjoy a coffee at Zuma Cafe.
Amazing markets ,"If you’re visiting Adelaide then a trip to the markets is something you really have to do. If you’re after fresh produce then you have to come to the markets. I’ve included some pictures of amazing fruit, veg etc  but the photos just don’t do them the justice they deserve. There is a huge choice of fresh vegetables, fruit, deli meats, cheese, bread, cakes, nuts and lots more. I come from the NT and we just don’t get this quality or variety. The colours, smells and choices can be quite overwhelming if you haven’t been here before. Take your time, talk to the amazing people who work here, ask them what they recommend.  They will tell you what’s best on the day. If you want good coffee, then you will be spoilt for choice, there are a lot of very good cafes and coffee stalls where you can buy everything related to coffee.The markets are also home to some amazing eateries, there are so many choices for either breakfast or lunch."
Always has a buzz ,"A must for locals and visitors alike, fresh produce to take home or grab a mealSaturday breakfast people watching is the go."
Cheeses,"I found these markets last time l was in Adelaide. The cheeses, breads, fruit, coffee are just amazing. Definitely the place to go and get dome amazing food. Carparing available, China Town just up the road.."
Saturday must do,"Always a must to visit when in Adelaide. So much fresh produce and delicious food options. Grab a coffee, some noodles & dumplings in China Town & some amazing cheese platter items for a lazy dinner. Our 2.5 yr old daughter loves the hustle and bustle too!"
Adelaide Must Do,"Unique to SA, similar to a South a Melbourne Food Markets, this place is a favourite for locals and bucket list items for visitors. Friday’s and Saturday’s are best!"
To buy food,Great variety of food on offer. Could be better choice of organic meat though. Worth a visit. A very good Cambodian restaurant there to experience authentic street food.
Amazing ,"A must if staying in the area, lots of local products and friendly staff well laid out and very reasonably prices"
A fabulous market,"Probably the best indoor market we visited on our tour round Australia earlier this year - at least, it was definitely our favourite! Well organised, accessible and well laid out, buzzing with a great atmosphere. There is a huge selection of food stalls - delis, cheese stalls, fresh bread and pastries, fresh ad smoked fish, fresh fruit/veg/salads, fresh meet - to name but a few. As we were self catering we decided to buy items for dinner and bought some amazing steak and fish salads. The market also boasts a variety of popular and excellent quality eateries. Fabulous market - enjoyed it so much we went back for breakfast one morning. Highly recommended."
Fantastic,"Visited on Thursday 27th February and again on Friday 28th February. There is so much to see and do there, what an amazing place. On Thursday we just checked it out and then returned on Friday to have lunch there, so many choices and the food is so cheap."
A great place. ,"As a child growing up in Adelaide we went Adelaide Central Market every Saturday. My Grandmother loved the hot cashews from Charlesworth nuts (and they're still there) plus the weeks supply of fresh fruit, vegetables. These days there are a couple of great fishmongers, butchers and a couple of fantastic restaurants as well, I especially like Lucia's Pizza and Spaghetti Bar and Le Souk and ofcourse the wonderful cheese shops, Say Cheese and The Smelly Cheese.It's a great place full of wonderful sounds, cultures and smells, a truly great experience  for everyone."
A hive of activity packed with fresh produce,"Get here early. A fabulous market with amazing fresh produce from fish, meat, vegetables, fruit and cheese. On the outer perimeter are some nice quirky shops selling crafts, clothes and wines.Definitely worth a visit."
Great for locals and travellers,Great for locals and travellers alike.So many different stalls to choose from.Everything from flowers to delicatesean foods.One of the best markets I have been to
Suits all Travellers & Local,"Spending a week in Adelaide and visited the market 3 times to eat. Not only is it good for the local to purchase their weekly fruit, veges and deserts, it also a great place to visit and enjoy a meal at any of the restaurants or china town.Would definitely recommend to all to spend a few hours and walk through the site to take in the smells and aroma of Adelaide"
Wonderful market with lots of variety,"We love markets and Adelaide Central Market is up there with the best.  Well worth a visit with a huge variety of fruit and vegs, continental small goods, flowers etc"
Good Market In Town,We always go the the big market when we are in a new town.  This is a good one and located in a central area.  Lots of stuff to buy here and some places to eat.
Amazing,"Amazing Atmosphere, great options of variety of food, beautiful coffee aromas, great seafood options. A must visit."
"Love, love, love!",I walked in and thought I was in Europe.  There's a wonderful array of stores and a terrific atmosphere.  Head there for a meal or simply a wander around to take in the atmosphere.  The produce is fresh and the vendors are passionate about their produce.  Not to be missed!
"Feels like you are in the heart of Europe, but this is Adelaide.","Such a buzz. You can enjoy the best coffee and a meal and then buy great breads and cheeses, the freshest of fruits and vegetables, deli foods, meats, spices...essentially this place has it all. But it’s the atmosphere and the friendly vendors that make the market such a buzz.  You have to come here as part of the Adelaide experience."
The Best Fresh Food Market in Australia,If there was only one reaqson to visit Adelaide this would be it.Their is no reason when you are in Adelaide to miss this Market (the free bus stops outside) and you would be silly to do so.It has a fantastic range of fresh and local produce all under the one roof (as well as a very good Asian Food hall and Market).Cafes and Eateries abound and all the food is as fresh as the day it was picked and just as tasty.We usually have friends around for dinner when we visit and we purchase everything from here for our dinners as well as shop for fresh produce on a daily basis.Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and go there.
Heart of Adelaide.,Love the multicultural cafés and food stores. I like the atmosphere there especially on the Fridays and Saturdays.Great place to enjoy grocery shopping and have a casual meal with friends or family.
Great market for fresh foods & a bite to eat ,"An old style market with a bit of cool & hip about it. Great fresh veggies & fruit, meats dips and loads of crusty breads to put your cheeses on to. Real made on site Turkish delight & fresh pastries to die for. Something for everyone really & easy ticketed parking upstairs not far from the city centre of Adelaide. We visited twice and ate a delicious Colombian breakfast at one of the cafes. A great asset in Adelaide."
It’s worth a visit ,"We got the tram from outside our hotel, lots of local produce (fruit, vegetables, meat wine) if we had rented an apartment we would definitely do our shopping here !"
The place to visit,"Each time we visit adelaide we stop over at the central markets. As Sydneysiders we are spoilt for ""Rundel Mall"" type shops which you find in many of our cities. But the Central Market ozzes personality, character and uniqueness. So for us it's the place to go for fruit, coffee, fish - actually just about anything but Goochy handbags."
Amazing market,"What a great place to wander around. So many stalls selling everything from fresh fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, cheese and dried nuts. Lots of street food outlets. Very clean. Ample parking, although we walked from our hotel. A great place to spend a couple of hours."
"wonderful, amazingly good!!","A visit to the market was a low priority, but we needed lunch and were nearby, so wandered over. It is in the city centre, so was easily accessible. Boy, were we in for a pleasant surprise. A market in the class of Melbourne's Victoria or the Barcelona Ramblas. Seriously!The fruit and vegetables, deli items (from a stall hung from end to end with salamis, a pate and terrine stall, a home-made turkish delight one, to freshly made fruit juices,)- all were magnificent.We had lunch at Samtass Fish shop- amazing!!! We had oysters shucked before our eyes, followed by salta nd pepper squid. Totally terrific!Did I say I liked it??"
Good for a wander and lunch!,A great but compact market with lots of yummy looking local produce. We found some quaint red tables and chairs then wandered around sourcing our lunch to eat in buzzy atmosphere.
Variety,"Extensive indoor market with so much variety. I came here while visiting Adelaide and spent a while browsing, and then got lunch from one of the stalls (falafel - which was delicious!).Unfortunately I had no kitchen facilities where I was staying, but I could see plenty of locals buying their fruit and veg, bread, cheese, olives, dips etc etc.Definitely worth an hour or so of time!"
Foodie heaven ,It has everything! Enough said ! Best appreciated early before the crowds make parking and finding a table in the cafes harder . Parking on level 1 is easier than the entrance level 2 .
A must when visiting Adelaide ,This is the quintessential marketplace full of vendors ranging from fruits to bakery items to meats to restaurants. Be sure to visit on a Friday when they stay open until 9pm instead of the usual 5pm close time!
Fun for the Inner Foodie,"The raw ingredients available in South Australia, coupled with the worldwide influences that brings these ingredients to market, make this a wonderful experience. If you like food, plan on spending at least half a day."
So much variety!!,"What a wonderful market, so many choices for snacks or things to buy and take home!! Excellent coffee from multiple vendors, the best chocolate cake I’ve ever eaten!! I’m sure you could find something to satisfy any craving at any time of day!!"
Outstanding ,This place is great easy to get around plenty to see. Plenty of places to eat.Has been going for over 150 years.Well worth a visit.
Fresh and cheap,"Central market is located within city. You can reach there via free tram and nearest tram station is Victoria square. There are shops for everything from vegetables, fruits, seafood, livestock then some eateries. Fresh items available at cheap price. It's open throught the week ex eot on sunday and Monday. Friday is the most happening day with all shops open and market is open till 9pm."
Our Return in 2020,"With one day in Adelaide, we had to revisit the Central Market.  We started with a huge Chicken Dim Sim which was almost on par with the Sth Melbourne Market ones.  Then we found the Porchetta & Canolli Bar and really pigged out. As a finale, we bought a bottle of red from Vintage Cellars and some double brie and fresh baguette from the Say Cheese shop for the Hotel Room.  We were in a foodies heaven!"
Must see! And visit! ,"Right smack in the center and just 15 min walk from our hotel (Mercure Grosvenor) . Colorful and full of life and lots of eateries around with freshly cooked options like Italian, Asian, local, Turkish etc . We went crazy with cheese and other beautiful condiments. Great spot for lunch , tourist attraction or food shopping all rolled into one!"
Busy Place,Such a choice of veg. There were little coffee stops mixed in with the food stalls and places to eat. Such a great selection of food.
A feast for the senses,What a wonderful way to spend an hour or more. Take advantage of any food purveyor who offers free samples.
A Cornucopia of Produce,"Wonderful under cover market in the middle of Adelaide bursting with the best of South Australian fresh produce: fruit and vegetables, nuts, dairy produce, preserved meats, providore, and fish and meat. A gastronome’s delight to compare with the best (think South Melbourne Market). Surrounded by retail outlets, cafes and street food stalls and with both parking and pubic transport access. Love it."
Market visit,We went to the market during the week very well looked after market with lots of variety of fruit and vegetables at good prices.lots of other specialty stalls also.walk around at your own pace.
Don't miss this highlight!!,"Our group of 6 visited these markets on 4 occasions during our 2 week stay in Adelaide. We had breakfast there twice and did a lot of shopping to pick up up supplies for our AirBnB house. I can safely say these are the best Markets in Australia, fantastic goods on offer and some great coffee there. We just loved the atmosphere amongst the throng of people."
Fantastic market,"Loved the Adelaide Central Market. I probably wouldn't have visited, or spent much time there except for my local mate who was very passionate about it. I can see why! It has a fantastic atmosphere! Amazing food options - ate breakfast and lunch here on different days - were my favourite, but the fresh food options in the very heart of the city centre were also incredible. Great juice bars. Has a bit of everything and great location. Chinatown right next door. Loved it."
Great food market with good atmosphere,Lively market with great selection of local produce.  Lots of food options for breakfast and lunch!  Right next to China town and lots of restauants in the area.
Good for food ,As I was backpacking and only had a couple of days in Adelaide buying food wasn’t really on the agenda. Great to see the market but unless you are buying produce not that useful.
Delicious Food - Amazing Athmosphere.,"We arrived in this market close to lunch time and it was boozing already with suppliers, fish mongers and a great array of stands and food vendors (raw products and already by products ready to eat).The place has several sections and it called my attention and actual French chef making terrines, pates, quiches and the whole nine yards of good ol French cuisine.Finally and after chatting and eating some of these delicacies we encounter the apple of my eye...a small Colombian place selling Colombiana drink, Arepas, Empanaditas, etc, etc. We had a a lovely time. The market is accessible with public transportation and it is very central and easy to find.Have at it and enjoy this food jewel. Highly recommended. In our itinerary we found it very useful and fulfilling."
Fantastic atmosphere and wonderful produce,The Central Market is a great place to shop. The range of produce is first class. If you can’t find it at the market it probably isn’t available. The atmosphere is excellent and the stall holders are friendly and helpful. There are several places for coffee and cakes or lunch. Lucianos is our favourite. Parking is free for the first hour which is a bonus.
Sumptuous tasting at the Central Market,Highly recommend the tasting tour. Chantelle was very knowledgeable and fun guide. Especially the wild food experience.
"Cool, healthy and worth a visit","In the inner city of Adelaide you can travel by tram free.  Caught a tram to the market.  It's a big covered market of local bits and pieces and fresh food (vegetables,  meats, cheeses,  etc.).  It was 42 degrees outside  but AC inside was wonderful.  Many eateries,  many meat/fish shops and many vegetable/fruit stalls.  Prices were reasonable with mostly high quality, few exceptions  however.  Overall a good place to visit and try/buy local and further afield produce.  You should visit here if visit7 Adelaide."
"Fantastic, huge variation of produce and very relaxed ","This is a real gem in Adelaide. There are all sorts of produce available (fruit, meat, fish, coffee, cheese and arts/crafts). All the produce looked great and all the stall holders were so friendly snd helpful. A must go to venue and located in the centre of town. There is a large car park too. Don’t miss it!"
Adelaide Central Market - a must for food lovers,"Adelaide Central Markets offers a wide range of fresh fruit, pastries to die for, and interesting food to eat at the market or take home to warm up.  It is a buzz of people.  Grab a coffee and people watch.  The live music was brilliant.  :)"
"Busy,busy,busy!","Free admission. Adelaides main food and produce market but also a place to eat and mingle also. Crazy, busy on a Friday afternoon but that only adds to the experience. Peak period I estimate is 5.30-7.00 pm. Closes at 9, watch out for the bargains in the last 30 minutes. Allow 90 minutes to have a good look around. Easy to find, a few places to eat here as well as in surrounding area."
So much food!,This was a good food market with lots on offer - my favourite was the Smelly Cheese stall which had great testings available and phenomenal cheeses to try (and buy). Definitely worth it if you're hungry!
Visit to the Market,"Possibly we went at the wrong time of year and a bit late in the day , a lot of stalls were closed or not operating , things we had heard about weren’t available but still worth a look and I’m sure after the holiday period and earlier in the day it would have been better"
Lots to see ,There are lots to see in the market. It has many multi cultural food under the one roof. Also have lots of fresh produce available.
A classic not really appreciated by the locals!!,Adelaide Central Markets are a real gem!Really appreciated If you have travelled elsewhere since they are a venue seldom matched elsewhere in the world.We often do not appreciate what exists on our own doorstep!!
Great food,Great experience. Had lunch there and great variety of food. Bought some fantastic tasting cheese. Good value.
History and Grazing at Central Market,An amazing way to begin your morning with a history tour and grazing the Adelaide Central Market. Learnt so much about the markets 150 year history and the stall holders. Some being at the Market for many generations.Clarrise our Host was full of information and showed the group her love of the Market and its history.She spoke clearly and her manner was happy and calm. You could tell she had also built a great report with stall holders.A real asset to the business.
So much to see and eat! ,Highly recommend visiting this market to experience all the local produce and the different cultures of Adelaide. We went over lunchtime on a Saturday and had amazing Paella to eat.
Great place to shop for grocery,"Best market. friendly staff. choices of many stalls, and cafes to eat. Lots of choices and variety of food."
Visited every day in Adelaide!,"This has to be one of the best markets in the country. It is so well laid out, easy to navigate, not too crowded, and reasonably priced. I was staying nearby so did my grocery shopping here throughout my stay in Adelaide, and ended up strolling through nearly every day. It felt great to buy local produce and support independent business. I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the prices were (and the quality was ten times better than what was in Coles next door!)."
Best of mafsydneytravels 2019,"Best of mafsydneytravels 2019*The best market - Adelaide Central Market, Adelaide*For gourmet food gastronomy, artisan breads, novelty shops and cafes"
This is great,We wandered from our central hotel and found this market. What a find. Plenty to see and plenty of food on offer. This is basically a food market selling all sorts of food. We stopped and enjoyed falafel at one of the local stores. Cheap and tasty. Plenty of other places to eat outside but we enjoyed the ambience of this market. If we lived in Adelaide this would be our place to shop for all things fresh.
Gourmet delights,"If you are into gourmet foods, this is the place to go. The delicious smells waft into your nose and immediately you are drawn to different cheeses, fruit and vegetables, different breads plus numerous other treats. There are places to have a coffee plus several eateries close by. Whatever you do, ensure this is on your to do list in Adelaide. I am sure, if you love your food like I do, you will not be disappointed."
My favorite place to visit in adelaide,"So much to see,  taste and buy in the great of adelaide.  Fresh fruit,  great tea,  delicious food,  great gifts.  It's a must see"
Central arcade market,"Very nice we really enjoyed although it does get too crowded... you can find a lot in this market like fruits, vegetables, selections of cheeses, meat, seafood etc. it should be one of the “must visit” while in Adelaide!"
Best food markets we have been to so far ,"We have visited all the markets in the main capital cities and these food markets are great. These are way better than the ones at home in Sydney which are pretty poor. They have a lot of fresh quality produce and we bought some local wines, delicious French tarts and some reasonably priced fruit. If We lived in Adelaide would definitely buy my produce at the markets."
Good selection ,"We’ve toured many ‘central markets’ over many years of travel.  I would classify this one as average when compared to others.  As a benchmark, we recently visited Barcelona, and their central market is exceptional!  Nonetheless, worthy of a visit on a drab day."
Great place to stock up for pic-nick,"Super nice place to stroll around and shop for bread, olives, ham and cheese. Vibrant and lively. Candy place in market is a hit."
Cool place,"Central Market very good place and things to see and do, to eat and drink and buy souvenirs, talk to people very helpful, the City itself is a good about a square mile."
Blown away,"The Central Market is truly outstanding.  The largest market of its type in the southern hemisphere, you will find anything you could possibly want to eat or drink.  There are cheese shops paired with bread shops; a Turkish Delight vendor; a stall dedicated to yogurt; wine purveyors; spice shops, etc.  In addition, the vegetables and fruit stalls are magnificent.  Piles of beautiful, fresh veggies and fruits at every turn.  There is no way to see it all.  There are multiple meat vendors, including those selling wild game.  We went to the market twice in the eight days we visited Adelaide.The parking is a little bit of a challenge.  You can park directly above the market, or chose a parking structure about a block away for a little bit less.  If you want to eat there, restaurants are around the edges of the space.  There are multiple different types of cuisine."
Everything under one roof...,"What a terrific concept.  All produce under one roof.  Has been here for eons.  An Adelaide icon.  Get cheese, fruit, olives, fresh meat and chicken, chocolate, nuts, smallgoods, exquisite coffees, Italian specialities, health/whole foods, eateries, supermarkets, Chinatown,  and much much more..."
"Clean, easy to get around & always interesting!","We were in Adelaide for the Pink Ball Test & decided to visit the Market to show our friends, who hadn't been there before. It is an interesting market & we enjoyed wandering around the many stalls offering fresh food, meat & fish, as well as the specialty stalls with second-hand books, the Asian section, and the coffee stands. This market is well laid-out, easy to navigate & fun to visit."
Big Surprise ,I was blown away by my visit to the Market I had no idea Australia had a food market to match the likes of Barcelona but it does .. enjoy the coffee bars and array of local produce.
Large indoor food market.,If you are into your food then you can’t get better than this. This is an indoor market with a large number of stalls selling a very wide variety of produce. There are also stalls selling coffee and food to eat on the premises as well as cafes. This is one of the must do things in Adelaide.
The best,I have travel the world almost but this would have to be my favourite so good I went back a few times for breakfast and lunch the food is fresh and the coffee is great don't mis it.
Adelaide Central Market,"The best touristy thing to do in Adelaide! Outstanding produce, food and local products. Arrive early to avoid the rush!"
Quality market,Market has a varied produce providers who are very pleasant to discuss their items.Stalls are in aisle concept with ample room to stroll through.There are plenty of cafe's to buy lunch but we bought bread rolls from a bakery then got ham and cheese from one of the deli's.There are several entrances into market which borders on Chinatown.A very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.
Great intro to Adelaide,"We often takes interstate or overseas visitors to the market if their flight comes into Adelaide prior to lunch. Wander, buy some crusty bread, antipasto, cheeses, stop fir a coffee then head home for a ploughmans lunch. Always a winner!"
Fresh produce,I highly recommend visiting the markets.  The range of fresh produce is outstanding.  Location is easy walking distance from city hotels. I’d highly recommend going in the morning and having your breakfast there.
Emporium of gourmet produce,"Adelaide Central Market is one of the best markets I've been to- an emporium for gourmet foods and delicatessen items. It showcases the best of South Australian produce in a big labyrinthine set up of stalls that winds in circles.There are vintage book stalls, sweet cakes, french patisseries, and different cuisines for lunch. I explored the markets over two days- the first day was more like a reconnaissance mission, and the second was to revisit favourite treats. I enjoyed a roast porchetta baguette with wild broccoli for lunch- meaty, decadent, salty goodness. Delicious!The stallholders are lovely, happy to have a chat with you, especially if you're a traveller, and keen to make recommendations. South Australia is the nation's gourmet food bowl. Here, you'll find delicious cured meats, locally produced gins, a plethora of cheeses and fresh ground coffee. I bought a series of dips and fresh breads, meats, cheeses and more for a picnic back home. Best decision I made while in Adelaide."
Hustle and Bustle! ,"We went on a Saturday and didn’t realise it closes at 3pm so that was a tad disappointing, will go back again this week! What a busy food market! Lots of tasters and amazing smells. Certainly somewhere to visit when in Adelaide, even if you don’t intend on buying anything it’s a interesting experience to walk round!"
Perfect. ,"Recommend a Christmas visit where you will discover everything you need for Christmas. Brunch, Lunch and Afternoon Tea is a must... So many choices for lovers of pasta and pizza Lucia’s is a must.  And coffee A salad at the big table or a coffee and cake... there are so many choices I can’t possibly list them all Make sure you visit the cheese shop in the middle of the market... where you can taste the cheese for free... international cheeses for tasting its a great experience for the kids as well. There are second hand book shops. Those travelling solo will enjoy a great people watching experience.. you will not feel alone. There are lots of people."
Fantastic iconic 160year old markets,"Fantastic markets with food from everywhere in the world! Stay at the Hilton Hotel next door and walk around the corner. French pastries & pates’, Hungarian pastries, fresh fruit & veg, Italian charcuterie - cheeses & salamis & hams. Delicious Italian treats. Kangaroo Island gin. Brilliant Local South Australian produce. Lucky SA folk with that on your doorstep!"
One of the best markets I have been too,I love markets anyway but this one definitely one of the best I have visited. Fabulous layout and choice. Great fresh produce and delicious food options everywhere. Well worth a wander but preferably bring an appetite.
Interesting,"We love walking through these type of places , good history and different cultures ,its like travelling overseas, without the cost.Do yourself a favour and visit !"
Market perfect for any weather,"I went to the market, purely as a Masterchef fan, I wanted to visit Poh's Jamface. Unfortunately I happened to visit a day after its closing, so unable to experience the venue (although it will be popping up at Adelaide Airport in future, so will definitely visit there). Disappointment quickly set aside, the market is a lovely enclosed undercover venue, with many stalls. Being a Wednesday morning, many of the stalls were not open, so we probably didn't get the full vibe of what the market had to offer. There are some great artwork on the walls, niche stallholders, and plenty of variety. I had some porchetta (with crackling to die for) and bagel/almond croissant/zeppole from a bakery. A must do for visitors."
Great market,This is a fantastic spot to grab some fresh produce. The atmosphere was great and the variety of goods excellent. Would love to have this in my home town.
Adelaide Central Market,"Good place to buy fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and meat but the place closes early. You can find many types of chocolates on sale here. There are some eateries here too."
Food glorious food,"If you love food go to the Central markets. A quick free tram ride will get you there. Plenty of delights to devour from cheeses, meats, fruits and veg, French pastries and more. Grab a coffee and have a wander or sit and have a bite to eat."
❤the market,Adelaide Central Market is just a great place to be.Amazing vibe..you can get it all here.Good quality fruit vegetables locally grow.A large range of spices and ingredients used in a variety of recipes from all over the world Fresh fish meat etcA lot of eateries..cafes theres just so much available here.Plus beautiful fresh flowers👍
Nice to visit when you are here,"We went once while we stayed in Adelaide but wanted to visit again. There were fresh vegetables, fruits, meats. I was not able to go restaurant there which seems very tasty. Hope to visit next time.You can also get Honey from Kangaroo island. Australian made soaps, too.I was not sure if the parking was free or not but better to go by car if you plan to buy lots of vegetables and fruits. You can go easily by bus as well.Free Wifi was not there I think, but you can always get free Wifi in front of Bank, most likely any bank in central Adelaide.アデレード 滞在中に一度だけしかいけず、また行きたいと思っていた場所でした。レストランも時間帯が合わずほとんどしまっていましたが、美味しそうなところがありました。シドニーの友人からもオススメの場所と聞いていました。新鮮な野菜やフルーツが買えるだけでなく、カンガルー島でとれるハチミツを購入できたりオーストラリアで作られた石鹸も購入できました。コーヒーも売ってました。無料Wifiはなかったと思いますが、アデレード 市内の銀行の前には必ずあります。"
Great place to visit and do good shopping ,Had a great bib bim bab totally recommend the Korean restaurants inside the market. You’ll be very happy
Fat toast,"The one must do experience in Adelaide for me is to visit the market for breakfast. Fat toast, poached eggs, bacon and beans. Coffee to die for."
Wonderful fresh fruit and vegs ,"This is a must see if your wanting fresh fruit ans vegs , plus meat and cakes and everythink you would like on your trip,  it also has a fantastic place to sit down and eat"
Wonderful market.,"Loved the atmosphere, sights and sounds.  Good fresh produce and speciality items. Lots of food outlets to satisfy whatever you desire."
Whole avenues of temptations!,"This has to be the most enjoyable way to shop in Adelaide. Huge variety of foods, fresh and prepared, excellent quality, we bought things for dinner and breakfast we had not even thought of before visiting. I only wish we had a market like this where we live. lucky Adelaide."
Amazing place ,Lovely place full of great local produce and restaurants always changing and always full of surprises we love the market and can’t wait to head back
Adelaide Central Market Tour,My wife and I booked this tour with Adelaide Central Market Tours and our guide Cheryl gave us a super guided tour with so many tastings.Cheryl was so knowledgeable and is well know in the market.We did not feel the 3 hours pass and were sad that it was over .Very well planned by the operator and we recommend this tour if u visit Adelaide.
Large bustling market,Plenty of fresh produce and deli selection.  Was a little disappointed in the variety of places to eat
A must do if you love food,"We spent the morning was definitely up and down the stalls , looking at the magnificent produce and meeting the locals. A great activity if you are visiting the city."
Le souk,Yum yum yum ...this gem offers north African food freshly prepared.  The owner was engaging and advised us of his recommendations...delish!
Great Foods!,"Highly recommended for fruit, veges, meat, cheese and basically anything your heart desires in the food department. Definitely worth a visit ❤️"
So many choices,A great market to visit while visiting Adelaide. So many choices of food outlets representing many countries with foods to take home or enjoy while dining there. We visited at midday on a Tuesday which was relatively quiet and relaxed. Our previous visit on a Friday night was packed with people but the atmosphere was lively.
Adelaide tour,A must see with vibrant lively stalls and great food and beverages...easy to access by foot in the centre of the city
Great Market,We went for a visit early on a Friday morning.  Our first hour it was easy to walk around but quickly got busy after that.  Lots of sample products from stallholders who were all super friendly. There is also some lovely restaurants attacted.
Lovely ,Great market with great produceFriendly stores with great samples Giant  chicken dim sims are pretty  bland
Great place,"Had a really good time walking around looking at all the different food stalls, delicious is the word that comes to mind. Friendly people and a lovely hour or two spent wondering around. Would recommend for sure. I didn’t take any photos sorry."
Gathering supplies fresh produce ,Love rocking in at the beginning of our stay to pick up local produce can’t go wrong awesome food lucias is a must too
"Great place to go.  Wide variety of cheeses, pastries, nuts, meat, fish, places to eat etc","What a marvellous experience.  The many different cheeses were to die for.  There were sooo many stalls with sweets, nuts, chocolates, breads, fruits and veggies, meat, fish, eating places etc.  beautiful cakes. And so many other things.  The Chinese food court was next door.  Well worth visiting."
Highly recommended,"Totally and truly interesting market, with heaps of different products, fun to try new food, and excellent coffee."
You can skip this,It is a very clean and nice FOOD market but absolutely nothing special. If you are not going to buy vegetables or meet I would say that you could get better lunch elsewhere. I wish we would have chosen a tour to the vine district instead.
"Delightful place to wander, watch and taste","Great food, smells and sights. Lots of variety to see. Lots of tastings too yum.Easy to navigate and plenty of room. very busy at lunchtime but the crowds soon clear."
Best market in the country,You can't have a true Adelaide experience without spending a morning or a Friday night in the Adelaide market!! It is truely iconic with wonderful stalls and speciality stores for all kinds of local and international produce. The market connects with Adelaide's Chinatown and is surrounded by all kinds of sensational eateries from all over the world. A short walk into the city too!
Market a must,"We go every fortnight and do our shopping, great bargains and such fresh produce, fabulous meat and deli products, we have our favourites and have gotten to know our shopkeepers, we always have lunch, either, Malacca, great noodles, Zumba, the best coffee in South Australia, Asian food hall for a variety of fresh delicious dishes, flowers always from flower stall in the mall, It’s our regular day out. Interstate or overseas visitors should have this wonderful experience that we are lucky to have on our doorstep....don’t miss out."
Sensational Variety of Fruits and Vegetables,I grew up in Adelaide in the 50's and 60's and I remember my parents and I driving into the Adelaide Markets on a Friday night to buy up bulk apples and other fruit and veg. Having now lived in Perth for nearly 40 years I have just returned to Adelaide and visited the Adelaide Markets again. In all those years the markets have only got better. The astounding amount and variety of fruit and vegetables is overwhelming. It's such a treat to wander around and take in all the different foods including chocolates and coffees and wines and cakes as well as exotic fruits and vegetables. There are also second hand bookshops which my husband enjoyed.
A bit of everything,"Central Market is a good spot for food, fresh groceries and delecacies. Parking space and cost is also a plus point."
Loved the vibe,"Wonderful spot to wander.  We only did a quick trip in and out. Got some fruit, lovely Turkish delight and fresh bread. I wish we had more time to do one of the market food tours - I hear these are excellent and well worth it."
Foodie haven,Excellent spot for a late brunch for travellers and to pick up supplies for substituting lunches and keeping costs while touring the cityGreat coffee from the specialists and live music on SaturdaysA good vibe and well worth visiting
Great variety of goods,We spent 8 days in Adelaide and visited the market several times.  There is a great variety of excellent fresh  available.  Recommend visiting.
Smells amazing,"It's bigger then l thought it would be, the range available is excellent, and the cheeses and breads, well the smells are just amazing.Every where l stopped the sellers were amazing, gave samples out, explaining where the differ things come from. Bought some amazing cheeses and breads, and some truffle oil, which smells amazing.Wish l had longer to spend there exploring."
Short and sweet,Great food selectionsGreat coffee selectionsSeafood? Could not find what was needesFruit and vegetables fresh and a great selection and stallsUnlike Sydney markets all avaliable are first class not seconds
Lunch Time Visit,"Having a lot of variety also reflects a variety of prices. We found that quality is at the higher end of the pricing scale as it should be, but there were several cases of good quality at a good price. To find this you need to do a bit of walking and observe the product quality on offer."
Market adventure,"Centrally located, this market offers an amazing array of fresh produce and delicious treats.From cheeses and Turkish Delight to unusual fruit and veggies, and so many choices of yummy places to eat.Central Market is a must visit destination!"
Interesting market,Wow what a gorgeous market to purchase fruit cheese nuts and vegesWith lovely street store cafe and eats on the edges of the market
I like markets...,"...however this at the more functional end of world markets. There are better things to do with an hour of your life in Adelaide than go here. Unless you want fruit, then it's worth a visit."
Highlight of Adelaide ,"All the family enjoyed the market. There was so much to see, taste and buy. Great quality food on sale and a great atmosphere. The market has been a highlight on our trip to Adelaide."
Adelaide Central Market,Love this market! Lots of fresh produce ranging from local and Asian produce. Definitely a must go in Adelaide
"If you can't find food you like, Go home",The market caters for every food taste and looked fresh and high quality.  We had a quick walk around before our flight and took in the sights.  We had a few free samples and experienced friendly service from all.
One of the best parts of our trip,"We came to the market each morning for breakfast, each day trying a new place. Everywhere was delicious!!  There are many unique vendors too. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables are available also meats and cheeses. Definitely a must if you are in Adelaide."
If that’s an ant then it’s for me,We had seen green ants for sale to eat on a Travel Guides program and were determined to find the stall - The girls were lovely and only too happy for us to taste the ants - a burst of citrus - would eat again! They also have succulents for salads and bison meat - such fun. The sugar can drinks at the back of the market are superb - we had lime and sugar cane and then lemon and ginger - fantastic - a great mock cocktail!
Wow! Food lovers heaven!,"Fresh produce, cafes, eateries, deli’s, gifts and wares, I think you’d be hard pressed to find fault with these markets. If I lived in Adelaide, this would be my regular shopping venue. In the heart of the city, it is truly a one stop shop experience. Interesting and varied produce, meats, cheeses, cellars, sweet delights. Must visit!"
market review,"The Adelaide Central Market is fantastic , loved going there for the fresh fruit and vegetables, delicatessen meats and produce , coffee , atmosphere. etc . Wish i could bring it home wirh me while i was in adelaide ."
Lots and lots of food,In this place you can find and buy all the food you need. All types of Asian food can be bought as well.
Feeding our faces,"We ate at the market food hall, which is very busy on Friday nights. Reasonable variety of Asian-type foods, priced quite reasonably. Very family friendly and pretty noisy - one young stall holder has a powerful voice and isn’t afraid to use it to keep the queue moving...I chose At Thai Kitchen and my husband chose beef in plum sauce from Tastes of China, which he had previously tried and liked. Not this time - beef was mostly tough and stringy. Not too pleased. But mine was nice: green curry, with plenty of green veges and chicken, served with a well-packed mound of white rice. I’d probably have this again. Obviously, the luck of the draw, here. Possible hygiene alert: some of the cleaning cloths being used on the plastic carry-trays looked none-too-clean."
"HUGE market, great to visit even if you don’t need to buy anything!","My husband and I visited as was recommended and was great! A massive market selling so much different fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, seafood, as well as chocolate, coffee, skincare products and books! Would recommend!"
Foodies dream,This is a must for anyone that loves fresh food and cooking. So much choice and all fresh. We spent a lot of time here and with the help of the friendly staff picked an amazing array of food to create several superb meals. It is well worth a visit.
Super busy ,So Incredible with such a huge variety of stores. The only bit that is holding it back from being perfect is the amount of stores that do not accept credit cards and only accept cash.
Pop up bar,"Great little gin bar. Owner, I think Jane was full of great recommendations such as restaurants (Sean’s Kitchen) where the food was amazing!"
Great food options,"If you are looking for fresh fruit & vegetables in Adelaide this is the place to go. However the market has so much more than that with fresh meat, bakeries, cafes and more. A great place to enjoy brunch on the weekend."
"Deli, vegetable, icecream and much much more","The Adelaide Central Market is a must visit. There is sampling stations spotted around for you to nibble on samples from the store holders while you feast your eyes on all of the produce you could buy. While wandering around, pick up a BBQ kransky on a roll just to keep you going. Otherwise, you will be tempted to rush in and purchase from the first deli you see.  The fruit and vegetables are so fresh. There are stores that sell seafood, wines, teas, ice cream, sweets, cakes, fresh bread and so much more. The Adelaide Central Market is located next to a street with lots of Chinese restaurants and some really good coffee shops. You could wander around this area all day starting with breakfast then go on to have lunch and finish off with dinner without leaving the area. The marinated squid, smoked salmon and calamari is really nice. If you are a cheese lover like me then you are going to be in heaven."
Best shopping experience in Adelaide ,"Adelaide central market is iconic, good for the soul. It’s true back to basics shopping with high quality local produce and so many options that just are not available elsewhere"
Market at its best .,Great place to visit even if U are not looking to buy veriaty colorful pleanty of people and a big tasty oriental food court with realy great stuff few hours big fan . Easy cheep parking one of a mast see in Adelaide
"""Eat your way around ""","So much to see, so much to taste.  Fresh produce and friendly stall holders.  Great place to visit in Adelaide city."
Adelaide Central Market,"We spent an enjoyable couple of hours here, soaking up the buzz of the market stalls, quirky book shops, so many places to eat, we went for Italian. I bought bush honey and tried a sample of their local gin, a must visit."
food and more food,every thing you could think of to eat and so much variety from a quick snake to a full meal the people were so friendly but not pushy
Great Souvenirs,"The market was similar to a farmers market in the U.S. except the ""stores"" had established areas and were more like mini storefronts. There was an attached food court located within Chinatown. They had mostly fresh food but also jams, honey, lotions, and other items."
Fantastic Market ,The Adelaide Central Market is fantastic it has a huge amount of food & vegetables including shops and next to China Town and is very responsible priced parking at the U Park Car park at 2 hours for $7 connected to the Markets.
Shopping Experience ,"You must come here :)Not only do you get the freshest fruit and veg, meat and baked goods but there's loads of random stalls selling all sorts - highly recommend the Turkish delight stall. There's also loads of cafes around the outer edge and plenty of seating so you can easily get a good meal (and it's right next to Chinatown too).Check out their events too as we had lots of free Jazz when we happened to be there"
Large and diverse,"Adelaide Central Market is very large and boasts a huge variety of regional produce - fruit and veg, meats, baked goods etc. German, Mediterranean and Asian influences are evident."
Great place,We visisited not really knowing what to expect the variety of food fruit and vegetables was amazing Also the amazing different local cheeses I just wish I was staying longer to try more
Outstanding ,Fantastic place for anyone who identifies as a foodie or drinkie 😛.  Friendly atmosphere and felt safe wandering throughout.
Shopping trip and lunch with one of my Grandsons,Had lunch in the Food Market today and was quite impressed with the variety of food choices. Very clean and staff friendly for the time we spent there.
Walking breakfast tour,"The breakfast tour of the Adelaide Central Market is an unique way to see the shops.  Given by a guide who starts you off with a piece of fruit and specially ordered coffee, you tour the market sampling the goods as you walk from stall to stall. It allows one to sample the different types of food available as well as confirm their freshness in being brought to market.  A fun way to start your day. It is surprisingly not tiring as there is so much to  see and taste. Comfortable shoes a must."
Touring,"Great variety, I took the tram from South Terrace and had an early lunch at the markets. Fascinating stores"
Fun couple of hours,"A very neat and clean market. Good to wander around for a couple of hours, have a juice and maybe a bite to eat."
Full of choices,"Located in the central area of Adelaide near the China town. The fresh food market has a huge range of deli, fruit veggies and meats opening from the morning. There are many restaurants in the surrounding area. Plenty of carpark in the building but very full."
"Delicious food, fresh produce! ",A definite must visit when in Adelaide. So much delicious food as well as a wide range of fresh produce. 100% recommend visiting!
Great market,Great market with all sorts of interesting and exiting products and produce. Take a big bag and plenty of money though there is so much great stuff to buy
Great fresh food market,This is a permanent market selling a vast amount of fresh fruit and vegetables from local growers. Our five night stay was in the centre of the CBD so it was so easy to get to the market by using the free tram which stops outside the main entrance.
Lunch trip,We had heard from people markets are good to eat at. Smaller and more intimate than Melbournes market but cosmopolitan in its feel with bits and pieces that would be good as gifts. A must visit in Adelaide. Easy to get to in public transport but we easily found a park 300m away. Delicious food and good coffee.
Sensational,"I spend a lot of time in Adelaide with work, and cater for myself 75% of the time. All of my food comes from the market. So does the cheese but that's another story. Dry aged Beef is my weakness, and so far I haven't been disappointed. Did I mention the Cheese? Fruit and Veg are fresh, just take your time and select what you're happy with, great variety. And the Cheese........."
Wonderful market brimming with fine food and provisions ,"I visited on a Friday lunchtime, one of the busiest times but still a glorious experience. I wandered , seeking lunch and found little Cambodian kitchen - fab flavours. Strolling through offerings of fine fresh veg i was entranced by glorious  wafts of mushroom, cheese, baked goods. I chose a couple of bottles of organic wines for $20 the lot. Very satisfying visit"
Traditional Excellence ,"Markets like this are few and far between. We love the traditional covered market and this one is excellent. Fresh produce, very reasonably priced (compared to Sydney) and a great range of local produce and specialty shops. Wish we could have something like this in Sydney - then we’d be here every week."
A great tour for foodies,Very lovely tour guide and fantastic stall tasting...first time trying green ants! We also love the Turkish delights and German sausages. Would highly recommended this tour to people who love trying new things and who enjoy the atmosphere of local markets.
Fabulous fresh food,"This is a huge market with beautiful displays of fruit and vegetables. Also a large range of butchers products and small goods. Locally produced bread, pastries and cakes are also available. There are wine stalls as well as produce from Kangaroo island."
A FOODIE’S PARADISE!,"As a result of a friend’s recommendation as a “must see”, we visited early on a Tuesday morning sampling the freshest of fruit by way of a breakfast followed by wonderful bread and pastries. We returned later that afternoon to buy pate, cheeses, olives, salad veg,   bread and wine, returning to our apartment for a delicious meal. This market is the best we’ve visited in Australia and is a foodies paradise. When visiting Adelaide, you just must find time to spend a few hours here - you will not regret it."
A real place were locals go shopping. ,As a part of your we were brought to visit the central market.We were happily surprised to find it a real place were locals go shopping for food or to have a drink and a bite.After all one hour well spent.
Well worth a visit!,"Great multicultural food market, so much choice and in a great location.We visited on a Friday late afternoon and the place was vibrant and offered so much to see, try and buy."
This has everything!,"We loved wandering the market!  We had some oysters, then shopped for unique foods to take home for gifts.  We had some lovely Aussie wines and shopped some more.  Then some Asian dumplings...a gin tasting...What a fun place- I highly recommend a stop here."
What a surprise to find these amazing markets,Someone had mentioned while in Adelaide to go to the markets. I didn't know much  about them and didn't realize they were undercover. How lucky are the people who live in Adelaide to have these markets. The cheese shops were stocked with amazing cheeses from all over the world. There were quaint little wine and coffee bars and so many stalls with the freshest fruit and vegies. I wish Sydney had markets like this.
Great way to spend a Friday night,"Busy with lots of things to do, taste, see and smell, only problem I found is it’s not very wheelchair friendly and most people are wheelchair oblivious!! Or just don’t care and I’m too low down to get served efficiently 🙄🙄 good thing I was with family"
Good place,"The market has free parking for one hour. Lots of places to buy fruit and veg. Prices are good. Cool places to have a coffee or some food.Can buy lots here. Fresh bread, coffee, meat, fish and groceries.Large seating area in one corner.Some fruit and veg sold cheap just before close."
Day out,Great experience if can not find the cheese you want or any type of meat bread coffee tea Chinese absolutely fun and great restaurants t choose from
Amazing ,What a great place to see and yes taste food !!A must to see and take your baskets for the most delicious fresh food !!
A GREAT EXPEIENCE,It was very enjoyable to visit the market and hear of its history over the last 150 years and to meet some of the multicultural stall holders.It was also good to be able to taste some of the diverse range of products on sale.Most enjoyable. A great atmosphere.
Lovely stroll with quality fresh goods,Fantastic market would recommend a stroll thru....everything available from fresh meats and cheeses to wines and snacks
Small Group Breakfast tour,"My  husband and I attended the  small group breakfast  tour it was fantastic. Our guide Cheryl was awesome, very informative and a load of fun. Allow plenty of time as the tour takes a couple of hours and trust me you will want to go back and pick up lots of goodies after the tour. We would highly recommend going to these markets and doing the tour when visiting Adelaide."
Amazing Food Stalls,"New to Adelaide we spent a morning looking around the market. The huge number of varying food stalls was amazing and worth a visit when first arriving in Adelaide if you need produce for an apartment stay. A few souvenir and other stalls also which we found to be good value. Although it shows ""Chinatown"" as part of the market, this is for restaurant food only."
Disappointed ,"Of the many central markets visited, this was rather disappointing. There's hardly any human traffic & variety of stalls not many. We had a quick walk around, did not attract us to stop at any shops & just went across to the Chinatown foodcourt to have our late lunch."
Interesting Market,"I've been to a few markets in Australia. Adelaide's a little different. It's slightly bigger than most. They have all types of stuffs ranging from freshly baked bread, meat, nuts, fruits, cakes & chocolates. Very interesting I must say. 1 of the recommended place to visit if you are travelling especially if you are staying in an apartment where you can cook"
So amazing ,"New to Adelaide I spent a Saturday morning wandering the market and enjoying its sights, sounds, and flavors. Everything looked fresh and of high quality, lots of shoppers means lots of turnover. I bought vegetables, wine, cheese, bread, olives and cured meat.  Lots of truly ethnic stalls and authentic foods. Treat yourself to El Souk for lunch if you go!"
Lots of good produce and food!! ,"Oh! I LOVE this market because of the variety of cheeses, bake goods, Turkish delight and fresh local produce!! Great place for quick grab and go breakfast and snacks. Closed on Sundays and Mondays! Would have loved to share pictures, but unfortunate I have downloaded all my pictures."
Best place !! You find everything !,"I just loved Central Market. You find everything you are looking for and what you have not thought about it too. Great variety of fresh produce , good quality deli and butcher's. Several options for snacks or meals , great variety and well priced."
Can't believe that I am reviewing markets,I never would have thought that I'd review a market but these markets are really good.  Fantastic fresh produce and awesome food.Every stall holder is genuinely and accommodating.  Definitely a place to visit in Adelaide.
Every week visit,"If you are from out of town or live in Adelaide,  this is a must visit. As I still work part time in the city, I do the weekly fruit, veg and meat shop here. Don't forget the great cheese, bread, coffee and cakes available. In fact it is all great.CHECK IT OUT. You won't be disappointed."
Worth a visit,"Market has excellent range of produce, bakeries, fish, meat and coffee shops. Central location, clean and good value"
Brilliant,"Just give it a try and enjoy all it has to offer. What ever you think you might like it will be there. Cheese to die for breads to make you fat!! Cakes and treats, it all there together."
Great!!!,Great cafes - restaurants - market stalls - atmosphere - shops!!!I love this place ... don't debate ... just GO VISIT!!!
Local favourite ,As a local Adelaide resident the central market part of my weekly shopping and dining calendar and never disappoint. If you are a visitor or a local these markets are a must.
A highlight of a weekend in Adelaide ,"Easy to find, easy to navigate, an amazing selection of stalls offering great produce and plenty of treats - there’s something for everyone and is a great way to start to stock up for a weekend of home cooked meals"
Like the markets in France,We wandered around this huge market with scores of different shops and eateries and had afternoon tea in a wonderful French patisserie.
Busy market with lots of produce and eats,"I visited the market on a Friday night around 7. It is a very busy market, with many stalls of produce, fish, meats, cheeses, and many eating establishments.  Easy to get to from center city square tram stop.  Ends in Chinatown.  Many other restaurants are around the area, too.  Kangaroo Island store, and a special Turkish Delight store are a must."
Interesting food market,We went to the market in Adelaide and it has character and plenty of tasty food for sale.You can choose very fresh food including fish and meat or you can have coffee and cake from one of there many cafes.
Excellent,"Great atmosphere, great fresh produce. Excellent selection of cheeses, meats, fish and poultry also, and more."
A fantastic market from a foodie ,A lovely few hours. We had breaki and wandered around. Great produce and very reasonable prices especially compared to Sydney.
Fresh produce,"Good place to spend a few hours getting out of the cold and wet weather in an Adelaide winter. Nice stalls with good variety of fresh produce, flowers, books etc."
I love markets ,"The markets are clean vibrant and full of hard working stall keepers.You can pick up a bargain from embroidered cushions wall hangings  and warm clothes.Cheap meals and beautiful fruit and vegetables, must not forget the scrumptious meat and cheese."
Central Market,"Love the atmosphere, the range, the people, its a great way to spend a Friday night or part of the night. Parking is good, we loved it"
Market food,"Adelaide markets are where all you produce needs can be met, coffee and food in abundance,local and imported produce."
"Fresh produce, great value for money!","Whether your after chicken, meat, fresh fish, oysters, fresh veg, smallgoods, cheeses, nuts, fresh bread of every shape and size, coffee, a snack, lunch or just the unique atmosphere of a market, then look no further.. Adelaide central markets has it all! Love it!!"
God I LOVE this place!,"Come here every time I'm in Adelaide. It's everything a market should be. Fresh, interesting and diverse range of food with lots of little eating places from different cultures. Head turning every 5 minutes, you can spend a LOT of time here. Just be aware of the parking fees. Lovely coffee and cake at Jamface. Highly recommend the fresh fish, esp the Coorong mullet. Wish I lived next door!"
Has everything gourmet ,Fantastic food market. A good idea to walk around first and compare prices. They can vary significantly for the same product.
Full cultural immersion ,"Variety of food, grocery and shopping.  Live music on the weekends and amazing atmosphere. A must experience in Adelaide."
What an eye opener ,"Wow talk about noisey hundreds of stalls and everybody shouting but such a great two hours,  bought heaps"
Lots of food to see,Really great time with lots of food and strange things like kangaroo crocodile and other. I like the cheeses and fruits very cheap.
Not to be missed!,"Ate and drank away the morning at the Central Market; super! Delicious coffee at Jamface ... amazing bread from The Market Bread Bar... onto cheese at The Smelly Cheese Shop, and then a a smoothie bowl at Jamu! And on the way out grabbed fresh fish at Cappi’s Fish Market. Wish we lived here!"
A must if you have the time,"We are so jealous that such a place of energy, noise, quality and diversity isn’t in our home town. We would go there even if it was only to go there and enjoy the vibrance of the stalls and the customers. The quality and range of food was incredible and only regretted we didn’t have longer to enjoy it let alone take advantage of the market and buy our groceries if we were locals"
Wished I liv d close by!,"We really enjoyed wandering through the market, sampling food that was on offer and indulging in some fantastic produce to take home with us."
Great place to eat,"Loved going to this market, lots of variety I  the food. Met a lovely stall holder and had good chat which makes my day"
Not just shopping but an experience,"As an Adelaide local I could not remember my last trip to Adelaide Central Market. As I sat having lunch with my bestie last week, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of the Market, I made a promise to myself that I would make it a regular experience. The food, the people and the vibe is amazing! Whether you're a local or a visitor, Adelaide Central Market us a must."
Worth frequenting ,Diverse range of food; great atmosphere and has great eateries. Easy access by tram. Just bring an appetite and your shopping cart.
Lovely market with lots of interesting stalls,Spent a few hours wandering around the market - there is an abundance of produce stalls maybe even too many but lots of other things that make it an interesting visit. Well worth some time
Great Produce,Coming from Darwin we were delighted at the array and choice of fruit and veg - bought some mangosteins and they were perfect!!
Must visit for lovers of fresh food,"Icon of the city and better than many in larger cities as its all in one place and in the central CBD. Easily got to by tram and buses on the doorstep and carparking. Everything you can want in fresh food, casual eating and with other  restaurants in the vicinity in the arcade and China Town and Gouger street. Plenty of fruit, nut and veg stalls, baked goods, cheese and continental meats,meat,seafood, honey,wine, coffee and casual dining. Cooks delight."
Market tour,"Great value. You receive a bag and then a couple of samples on the tour plus a free coffee, pays for itself. We learnt so much about the history of the markets, the stalls and the products. Well worth the time to take the tour, great guide, friendly market stall vendors and amazing products. Just do it."
A nice stroll,"A must see when you go to Adelaide.A very nice stroll. Fresh fruits and vegs. There is nice coffee place, a small book stall, I’ve got some fruits there. There is a very nice Chinese restaurant near by, try the food!! Very good! It’s always busy though. It’s next to Paparich."
Who doesn't like a market?,"So often a place where we end up on a Saturday. The food is always fresh, prices are great and the atmosphere is fantastic. with loads of little specialty shops and great food in the food court, the Adelaide markets is a place you need to make a regular visits to."
Amazing ,"Ever since I mentioned I was going to Adelaide, I was told check out the markets! Wow was I blown off my feet. You can buy anything here from food, to pharmacy and everything in between. We caught the free connector bus. Lots of fresh food."
"A wonderland of sights, smells and tastes","We explored the markets on a cold, windy day. We found a wide range of fresh foods to purchase and some for free tasting. There was a live French band playing as Bastille Day was being celebrated and the atmosphere was light and friendly. Highly recommended 👍🏼"
Wandering around Adelaide on a wet winter's day,"What a delightful experience wandering up and the isles full of wonderful fresh food and produce. From fish to fromage, wurst to watermelon and confectionery to coffee, the market stalls teem with flavours and aromas from all corners of the globe. A must see whenever in Adelaide."
So much to see,"As an amateur foodie at heart, this place  certainly delivered!There's fresh everything here.A Cheesemonger, Butcher, Fish Monger, fruit and vegetables, Sweets, fresh food and coffee (coffee is everywhere) and tea. There's massage places to retreat to for a well deserved massage. It's near Chinatown, so if you're up for Asian foods, this is a place to come and visit. The food court is quite a visit as well.I love how easy it was to move around. It's on par with Sydney's Paddy's Markets, just not as big. But, still very much worth the visit. Parking is a bit bothersome, and takes a while to get into, especially above the markets, just keep that in mind. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the markets and definitely recommend!"
This market is quite unique as the whole market is not covered by roof and next to it is China town,"I suggest to come here and take a look at the variety of goods and food offered. There is Cafe Lucia, special yogurt parlor and Cambodian street food. We did have Cambodian chicken porridge which we like very much during a cold winter morning. We also have coffee at Cafe Lucia and ordered Yogurt with chocolate cookies, a nice combo for dessert."
Beautiful array of fresh fruits and Vegetables,"A beautiful place to visit with everything you can imagine, so many goodies it is hard to choose.  Amazing fresh fruit and vegetables, fish, anything you want really."
A great tour - a tick for the .bucket list!,"As an Adelaide resident, I had wanted to do a Central Market tour for a long time - I took the opportunity to gift the breakfast tour to my daughter, who lives overseas, so I got to do it too! We started with a delicious breakfast and coffee, then Cheryl gave us a great tour and imparted a wealth of interesting background on the Market - I thought I knew all about it, but learnt so much more! Particularly  enjoyed visiting the Indigenous foods and Kangaroo island stalls. And to finish - another great coffee! I will be back to shop at the Market and my daughter is keen to take her fiancée on a tour as well. Highly recommended - thank you Cheryl!"
Lots of food and activity ,We really enjoyed visiting this market on a rainy day in Adelaide since it is fully enclosed.  It had a great mix of fresh food and restaurant vendors and offers a wonderful view into the multicultural influences in the city.
Fresh & Cheap,Nice place to go for shopping for fresh cheap veg. Lots of varities available. Sometimes get disappointed with unprofessional sales person.
A feast for your senses,"Central Market of Adelaide is truly a place of action; while you can either be involved or sit back and soak in . Connected to China Town on Gouger St, renowned for its many  restaurants and cuisines  ..."
Variety of Fresh Produce,"This is the best place to go to satisfy your food needs. So much variety. Food from different countries are widely available as well. Definitely a must stop for food lovers. Sausages, fruits, cheese, veggies, pastries, name it, they have it here"

Amazing variety and value ,Truly one of the best markets I have visited amazing varieties of food from baked goods to specialty meats sausages cold cuts.Vegetables and fruit from many different places. Then they also sell beer wine and other drinks all at very reasonable prices.
Best produce market in Adelaide,You can buy everything here. I love going to the central market because they have super fresh produce and I usually can see more kinds of veggies here than in the supermarket. I just love coming here!
Loved this place good food,Great place for foodies or you like to try different things. Good place to grab fruit and vege to street food to cheeses and flowers. Meat seafood anything you could possibly need!I wish Brisbane had something like this.A must for a visitor to Adelaide.Nice coffee. Desserts wow look devine. I wish i had more time here. Parking free first hour.
A must for a visit to Adelaide,"A wonderful place for lunch and to do a spot of food shopping. Wonderful fresh local produce at very good prices, but do wander the isles before you buy as the prices do vary! If you are a cheese lover, Stinky Cheese is the place to go, try the cheeses they are offering free tastes of and I bet you can't resit buying them!"
Breakfast,It’s Banshee and MungoWe hadn’t been to the markets for a whileI would like to say how fabo these markets areWe have travelled extensively all around our beautiful planet The Adelaide Central Markets are the bestWe highly recommend calling inMungo
Great on a Friday night,"The place was buzzing, so keep an eye on the kids.Food hall seemed very authentic.  It felt as though you were at an overseas night.Hunt the best deals on the fruit and veg or sneak some awesome lollies in."
Great selection of local produce,A relative who we were visiting in Adelaide recommended that we visit. Perhaps they recognised that we are foodies and would come back well loaded for dinner that night! Start with a coffee at The Grind. Avoid imported cheese. Fantastic Aussie cheese available. Try the Tasmanian Triple Cream Brie. To die for. That is if you eat a kilo every day.  Our favourite blue - King Island Dairy Ash Blue. Great honey shop - but .... if you are travelling interstate within Australia honey products are not allowed. If you are not vegetarian try some of the exotic meats. Sorry Skippy.
Great market,The produce and service are second to none. Family oriented for shopping and dining. Easy access by tram.
Free market with great food stalls,"They say this is an the largest ""covered"" fresh produce market in the southern hemisphere and it fells like. Still many people come here for their daily shopping. you can also grab a cheap meal here. Open late on friday night, closes early saturday and closed sunday and monday."
fun filled and free,"We took our grandson of four into the market for a look around. I used to dash in there at least one day a week mainly to the Asian shops, but since I’ve been retired I don’t go as much.The overall ambience is the same, full of vibration ,colour and people.New stores seem to be popping up and they are very interesting. The one that took our eye  mostly was the Turkish delight shop, which is filled with amazing mountains of colourful and exotic looking confection.I could have bought one of everything!We wondered around, sampling everything  .....cheese, olives, a mushroom cooked with truffle salt here, a mandarin slice there.It was comforting to see old friends like Lucia’s and the Providore.. the fish shops and the flower stall , which had buckets of divine peonies in all colours.We grabbed some more scrumptious cheese sticks from the trusty Say Cheese stall and we were out in just under an hour, so parking was free too! Bonus!"
Interesting market,Adelaide Central Market is very popular with both locals and tourists.  There are many stalls offering a wide range of foods- both fresh and cooked.  We found an excellent butcher and many fruit and veg outlets so there was lots of choice in both price and quality.  On some days not all stalls are open.  There is  good access to Coles from the markets.  Public transport is nearby as are car parks including one above the markets.
fantastic array of stalls,We unfortunately went on a Wednesday and some of the stalls are not open but the ones that were open certainly made up for it. I ate breakfast at Le Souk. Best food and excellent friendly service. If you are staying in Adelaide come to the markets to do all of your food shopping. You won't be sorry.
Excellent food shopping ,"The Adelaide Central market is fabulous. It is a unique under cover food market with something for everyone. Lots of great vegetable stalls, amazing choices and lots of food stalls for the hungry. It needs to be preserved as it's an icon of Adelaide."
Wonderful Market!,"Loads of good food and wines on offer. A great variety of local produces on sales. Nice stalls selling delicious food for lunch. Fresh flowers, fruits and spices makes this place a beauty."
"""To market to market""","The fresh fruit, veggies, meats, cheese, fish, eateries, clothes and jewelry!  You have to see it for yourself.  Lots of places to eat and drink.  Its such a great place to do your gift shopping and pick up your groceries at awesome prices.  Farm to table shopping at its best"
Memory lane at Adel Central Market. ,Used to get lolly fishes and the market with grandpa and grandma - dropped in to see that changes and smell the smells.Fun and busy and worthwhile
Stroll Around The Markets,"We spent an enjoyable morning at the Adelaide markets. Arrived by tram, after a very short walk to the markets, we were impressed by the activity around us. The stalls were mixed and varied. Food stalls especially colourful with a wide range of produce. A very enjoyable and memorable visit."
Great market for food! ,We stayed close to this market and went there about 4 times while we were in Adelaide. Seriously great delicatessens and produce stalks. Also good coffee shops and dessert outlets. We stocked up cheeses and deli foods for our hotel room and lunched there too. We loved it.
Amazing food,"The Market is so amazing. There is food from all over the world. Fresh produce at great prices. Great Meat, Cheeses, Cakes and the choice of cooked food is so vast. Each time we visit we take home amazing breads, Cheeses, Veg, Also some interesting food from other countries, Russian, Italian, Greek, Asian to name a few. It is a vibrant place to visit."
"Great Market , best produce","Well worth a visit. The produce and stalls were top quality. Had a great ambience, and a 'foodie heaven'"
Discovery Tour,"Great tour, only few people in group. Markets were busy but got around fine. Clarisse our guide was up to date with products and looked after us. We got to taste and see a great array of products."
Great quality local produce,So many great stalls with a delicious array of local and imported produce.  Lots of eateries and cafes to choose from.
The big market ,"Lots of different food places to buy groceries, cheeses, meats, fruit and veg, as well as eating stalls. Good variety, nice feel. Worth a visit"
Great place,"Still a great place to shop with the first hour of parking free. So many stalls and eateries. I enjoy being able to purchase organic fruit and vegetables, chicken, meat, (from Barossa Fine Foods, show your Senior's card for 10% discount), fish,(from Angelakis) chicken, (from Vegas), eggs, cheese, coffee beans, mushrooms, French terrines, bread, grains etc, (Goodies and Grains give 10% on presentation of Senior's card),flowers, etc, etc. The list is endless. Plenty of places to eat or just to enjoy a coffee."
Amazing Markets,We went there a few times just looking around and enjoying the shops and what they were selling...and different items ...
Whilst it is a fun place at the same time very dear.,"Over the years the prices of the fruit and vegetables have been increasing to such an extent that it is not worth while to purchase hardly any at all.You can walk around and wonder why they charge so much.The quality is excellent.there are only two vendors that are a good price, 2 brothers I think they are called and another nearby. It is a experience though to check out all the continental stores who have a good variety of cheeses and continental products.You can judge when you go there."
One of my most Favourite Plces to go to!!,"Love, love, love.... we go regularly for a Saturday brunch, so many wonderful food stalls, that I don't know where to begin... well worth a visit as a top destination for Adelaide.  Great breakfast places, fantastic coffee...any type of food you wish to buy and just the vibe...just love sitting in the food section near Zumas or Lucias and absorbing the atmosphere of a busy morning of people watching..... go and do this....."
A must do with an amazing range of produce,"A favourite place of ours when in Adelaide and a good place to catch up with family. There is a multi level carpark which makes access easy, even when my brother was in a wheel chair, the access was good. The local produce is on display with King George whiting and Coffin bay oysters, large plump rabbits in the game displays, wonderful tasty duck terrines and goose liver pates, the tastes are truly tempted here. On the Saturday morning it was packed with no tables available so we bought up supplies and went to a park for a wonderful lunch."
Fantastic Place To Visit,Lots of great fruit and veg.    So many interesting little stalls with things like cheese.  Nuts.  Chocolates.  Honey. Meat.  Fish  The list goes on.   Lots of great eateries and coffee.  Wonderful atmosphere.   If in the Rundle mall catch the free tram to the markets
Much of the same ,"I really liked the breakfast choices that were available at the markets. It’s really the same as what is available elsewhere (fresh fruit, vegetables, bread etc)."
"Plenty to see,eat and buy",A very large covered market close to the city centre just up from Rundle mall band Victoria Square.You will find a huge variety of foodstuff and potential gifts. Just fun to look around
What a great place,"We walked from the hotel to here on the day we arrived in town.  Great selection of fresh food available.We wandered around and had an impromptu meal at the Paella place which was really nice.  Then we had dessert at the cake place, which was scrumptious.The food and Veges all looked good, and the Turkish Delight place is well worth a visit.We'll be going back there on the weekend to stock up for the rest of our trip"
Best place in Adelaide for foodies!,"Such a fantastic, vibrant market. Full of the freshest foods with a brilliant selection!  A MUST visit for tourists and shopping destination for locals.

Shopping ,Good place for shopping All types of brands and groceries available at nominal price Get there by tram or cabEnjoy your day there
Worth the visit,"A visit to Adelaide is not complete without visiting the Central market. You can see everything there from fresh produce, dry goods, souvenir items, cafes, restos, food stalls etc.  The place is reachable by tram and very convenient. I recommend this place to visitors."
Limited tasting,"Some great cheese, dairy and bakery options but sadly they had limited free samples to try which is half the fun of a market!"
Fantastic,"What an array of fresh fruit and vegetables, boutique foods and alcoholic beverages. All the stall holders were friendly and knowledgeable. Thanks"
Debbie,Fabulous market with lots of high quality goods.   Lots of samples to try before you buy.   A great way to spend a few hours especially if the weather is not too good as it is uncover.   Good parking as well.
So Much Fooood....,We only get into the Central Markets a few times a year and go a bit crazy when we do. Special mentions to:- Le Souk - great coffee and breakfast- Wild Loaf - love their Fig and Walnut loaf- House of Health - multiple muesli options at good prices- Dough - bagels and cakes make me salivatePlenty of others to spend your money at and always busy. Wish they were open Sundays but can't be greedy.
Gems to be found,Wandered thru the markets and found a gem of a cafe with fantastic food and service LeSouk is a unique eating experience with service to matchCoffee was made with great care and presented beautifully We shared a mixture of foods from brown rice to Chakchouka which were great in taste and flavour Highly recommended
Hit and Miss,The Adelaide markets were a bit of hit & miss. Lots of lovely fresh produce and some nice eateries. But there were no gift stalls or good clothing stalls. We’ve been to the Victoria markets in Melbourne so our expectations were high. Sadly expected to spend a few hours at the Adelaide markets but were done in an hour.
Sooo good,"I would move to Adelaide just to visit this place more often, great vibes and fabulous food. Must do on a visit to this city."
Fantastic food experience,"Fabulous visit for the family trying some delicious food. Highly recommend. We loved 'Lucias' , smelly cheese and the lovely patisseries."
Adelaide Central Market,"Everything you can buy fresh is at this Market.  All under one roof.  Fresh vegetables, cheeses, small goods, fish, meats.  Even coffee shops and if you get hungry, you can have breakfast and lunch there too.  Plenty of cafes outside the markets as well."
Easy and enjoyable,"Large range of fresh produce, heaps of places to grab a coffee or something to eat. Close to public transport and heaps of parking. Relaxing atmosphere with a variety of foods for everyone."
Exciting variety of fresh produce ,The quality and variety of produce available at the Central Market was amazing. Everything is presented beautifully with lots of samples to taste. And we had a great breakfast at Zuma
Full of wonderful produce!,"We were fortunate enough to have had breakfast and a guided tour of the Market with Nick Begakis the chair of the Adelaide Market and what an experience! We really enjoyed the variety of meat, fish and produce on display and were intrigued at how well the culture of Adelaide was portrayed, showing just how much effort has gone into making this much more than just a market.It really is a must go during any visit to Adelaide."
Pbobb,Very nice traditional try the rolls with salami and the coffee close to town can walk from most hotels must see when you are there
Once you should go if in Adelaide,A huge food and vegetables market on ground floor...I enjoyed there...it connected  me to the local culture and the people
Easter breakaway,"Always a good place to visit, everything is fresh, and lots of food to choose from everything from chocolate, bread, veggies, flowers, nuts, you name it it’s there,  places to sit and rest and have a quick bite and a cuppa, would recommend to anyone travelling to Adelaide"
Awesome experience,Need a market lime this in my own home town. So fascinating to see all the delicious fresh produce. Awesome!
A must do in Adelaide,This market is as good as it gets.  Variety/display mouth watering. If I lived in Adelaide as I would do all my shopping here. Its paradise for cooks and foodies.
Wow,"This must be one of the best Central Markets I have visited, as well as one of the largest, if In Adelaide it is certainly worth a visit, the produce is fresh and tasty too, the coffee at the coffee stall is a must have too.  Additionally just of the the main part of the market, is Adelaide China town which has a fantastic Asian food court, and believe me the food is fantastic, and cheap too."
Yummo with Cheryl,"If it hadn’t been for Cheryl we would have not had the experience that we did. If you had walked into the markets and weren’t a local we could have purchased things that we wouldn’t have been able to take to our next destination, WA. She was amazing with her knowledge and we tasted yummy things. A must do. You in SA are so lucky to have such awesome produce on your doorstep."
Great Historic Market with Amazing Foods,"Green grocers, butchers, bakers, confectioners, and florists...it’s all here. Plus there are some amazing food stalls with local and international fare. One stall even cooks up a gigantic pan of Paella each day at 1230."
Amazing food at great prices,"There is a fabulous rang of every food item you can think of from fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood and bread. Prices are far lower than at supermarkets and you can see the difference in the quality and freshness. You can get a ""big"" breakfast or lunches (gourmet rolls with fillings like fresh fig and prosciutto) or visit China town or Vietnamese stalls for something spicy. There is also a Coles supermarket, butchers, bakeries, jewellers, shoe shops, travel agents, tavern etc. Easy access by tram or bus."
Fantastic market!,"This is one if the best markets I have ever been to. It is super colourful, not too noisy, clean and well organised. There are so many wonderful lunch options and fresh produce at great prices!"
Must visit Adelaide Central Markets ,I’m a foodie. This is a slice of heaven !! I was interested in these markets because of celebrity chef Poh .. but there is so much more depth to these markets than that. I didn’t even eat at PieFace as I’m a very Green Foodie liking  gluten free sugar free natural wholefoods most !  We investigated aisle by aisle and spent a good part of the day there !! Oh the choices and variety !!Delicious local produce and freshly made everything. Visit. Eat. Enjoy.
Fresh food shopping - Everything you could ask for!,"Friday nighs in the markets is fantastic. a great chance to smell, taste and see the sights of Adelaide's great food options. taking the family for a walk around was great. love spending time with my family and always enjoy these times."
Best food market in the world ,"This market has to rate above Borough Market as one of the most authentic food markets in the world.    An abundance of fruit, meat, cheese and much, much more.   The place is always buzzing with people,  bringing a vibrancy to it.  Well worth a visit."
fun place,"lots of atmosphere , the smell of the goods make you hungry and plenty of places to eat from asian to italian  bakeries plus all of your fresh produce"
A jewel,"Adelaide Central Market is a precious jewel in the heart of the city. Fresh vegetables and fruits, cheeses, small goods, meats, fish, poultry, bakeries, cafes, cuisines of Italy, Malaysia, Germany, France, China, India have their home here. Locals and visitors dine on the best, take home bags stuffed with delicious treats free from chemicals and packaging. There is a pulsing life bursting with vitality and camaraderie founded on the bounty of the soil and the sea. The best in the world available to all who come."
Amazing Variety!,"We spent an entire morning browsing around the market and made several purchases including, cooked meats, bread, cheese and wine which we enjoyed sitting on our hotel balcony watching the sunset.There is a vast amount on offer here of the finest quality, it’s worth a look around even if you don’t buy anything, there are several great places to have lunch or just a coffee and lots of stalls offering samples. Stall holders are friendly and helpful, all in all a great experience, we went back and bought spices to bring home."
An assault on the senses,"What an amazing place. Al fresco dining of every kind and the hustle and bustle of an open market with fruit and veges so fresh, it must still be growing! The most amazing selection of cheeses I have ever seen and loads of wine specials. A great place to visit even for people watching, while supping a fresh coffee or beer. Spent 3 hours here and only saw a small part of the complex."
Good fun,A nice way to spend a few hours. Even if you go gor a browse and cheap lunch it's a great place to check out
Food heaven,"Lots of excellent food venues. If you love cheeses, you are in the right space. A bit of everything in the space and a great way to spend an hour."
Fortnightly visit,"I shop at the central market fortnightly. I take advantage of the free car Pk. I’m in and out in an hour.Love the place . The friendly atmosphere and the beautiful aromas. Large variety of fruit and vegetables. Flower shops, asian shops, butchers and all sorts. Great for a coffee or a meal . Plenty to choose from. Definitely a must to experience. Even if for only an hour."
Brilliant place!,This place has everything you could want from a supermarket that is fresh and under one roof. I really wish that we had somewhere like this in the West of Scotland. For the best choice I'd say get there before lunch but if looking for a bargain you can go a bit later when some of the independent traders are selling off some stick for cheap.Everln if you are just passing through it is well worth visit just to see how amazing the produce is and you can pick up some snacks for your journey and even grab some lunch in one of the many cafes and restaurant's in the area.You really most visit this place to appreciate what it has to offer.
