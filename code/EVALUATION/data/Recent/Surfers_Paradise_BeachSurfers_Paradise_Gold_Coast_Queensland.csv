Breakfast near the beach ,Had a maccas breakfast It was okOnly very few people around Birds came while we were eatingNice scenery relaxing b4 we had to fly home!!!!!
Beautiful & Clean,"Such a beautiful place and the sand is like no other. Even with lifeguards on hand, make sure you swim between the flags because the sea is rough... there is a reason it is called 'SURFERS PARADISE.'"
"High Surf, Great Fun.","Every day during our stay the waves were crashing into the beach and going for a ""swim"" was not an option.Playing around in the surf infront of the surf lifeguards was far better, a lot of fun, tiring and exhilarating all at the same time.Quite an undertow on occasions but taking heed of the advice of the lifeguards meant we had a great time. The views along the beach are awesome. Some of the buildings are works of art. Not to be missed if you are in the vicinity."
Stunning beach as far as you can see....,February was really quiet......but fabulous! The sand sculpture championships were on and fantastic!Great to walk hand in hand for miles in Luke warm waters...divine!
"Such a,beautiful beach",Surfers paradise beach is so beautiful but was so disappointed to see dog poo on beach other than that it's beautiful and our view of it from the q1 was amazing
Not a nice swimming beach,Must do to say you have been there but was rough everyday we were here so unless you are a strong swimmer would not recommend going in the water
"Nice place, good shopping and restraunts",Nice place to visit and snap a picture under the surfers paradise sign. Beach is good however there are nicer beaches south of surfers paradise on the Gold Coast. Quite touristy however heaps of places to eat along the beach and shop. Heaps of things to do in Surfers.
Great beach,Beautiful beach lots of waves when I visited nice clean sand beautiful walking on the promenade lots of cafes opposite the beach.
Lovely for a walk,Surfers is a bit of a dump! Let‚Äôs face it. The beach however is a great opportunity to walk and enjoy some time by the sea. Great to get out of the hotel and wander on this iconic beach.. and get away from surfers to the more appealing Broadbeach
Best Beach,It's just best place to relax. its sand is  outstanding. I have never seen white and clean sand like its.
Fantastic beach!,"Beautiful beach, calm waters (when we visited), and lots of nice cafes at the beachfront. Ideal for families who enjoy an early stroll at the beach while having a coffee. I highly recommend."

Enjoy it all,So much beach to have so many views to enjoy loved every bit of it neat tidy and clean ‚ô•Ô∏è spent every day down there at some point
Better than California!?,"Miles of golden sands that are kept in beautifully clean condition. Great shower and cold water facilities. So much space, great waves and just about all the local amenities you could want (and a few you might not if you‚Äôre not into touristy stuff or the party scene at night) This was a great place to stay. Super friendly locals, safe environment for kids and the beach was better than any that we visited doing highway one in California. Loved it."

Lots of cafes and bistro along the sidewalk of surfers paradise with boutiques and malls‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Soft sandy beaches & great waves,"Soft sandy beaches & great waves make this a great place to spend a sunny day! The esplanade and beaches are clean, as are the numerous public restrooms. Lifeguards are numerous and alert to surf/weather changes. When it gets a bit warm head into the cool clear water. After your beach day, enjoy a cool drink & bite to eat at one of the many food stands/restaurants and bars or shop in an air conditioned mall. We enjoyed the sand sculptures which were up through 3/1. Just pay attention to parking signs as they vary in some locations due to the evening markets."
Great Beach,The beach was beautiful. Patrolled by lifesavers and not too busy. Water temp was great. Had a couple of days the beach was closed due to a cyclone off shore but otherwise would totally recommend.
Beautiful,"Beaches are beautiful and are constantly cleaned every night, cleaners are out cleaning these beaches every night and are constantly maintaing their beauty"
Beautiful beach and beautiful people,What a fantastic beach. I could stay here all day. We even got to see some of the amazing sand sculptures
Great beach and world famous,I unfortunately visited this world famous beach on a cloudy day.This is a beach I frequented numerous times as a child and adult as I lived in Brisbane for many years.This is very touristy and you woill find lots of hotels bars and restaurants in walking distance.A great family friendly beach and quite safe if one swims between the flags.
Great beach,Can be a little rough at times. But very good. Beach was also next to excellent restaurants and shops

It‚Äôs a must once in your lifetime,Fabulous clean beach not a bit or plastic or paper on it always lifeguards on patrol  just like you see it on a postcard
Beautiful Beach,"This is a very beautiful sandy beach, and very clearly the main attraction of the Gold Coast. The waves were pounding in when we were there.  The safe swimming area was clearly marked. It‚Äôs a busy beach, but there is a lot of it! There are showers for your feet, as well as your body along the promenade! There are also plenty of toilets. A swim, or at least a paddle, is an unmissable activity when here.  We loved it."
Four days on the Gold Coast.,"My grand daughter came on a four night break to surfers paradise, she loved the beach and can‚Äôt wait to go again."
Endless Gold,What a postcard perfect beach ..Endless Golden Clean Sunny..what else someone would want...excellent both in the day as well as at night...there are lots of life guards on duty..
beautiful beach,"nice to walk on the beach and watch surfing. There are lots of life guards, please swim and surf between the flag."
Very nice beach for all activity day and night,"Great beach for walking at day and night, check night market day you can find something good made by local; maybe too many people visiting there is always an idiot make place dirty on chairs and toilets.. Suggest put more lighting and children activities in beach walk like south port playground very successful for family members with young kids."
Surfing,Was a epic day we were there but the traffic was terrible and the people were rude and not very friendly. Lots of development still going on. I‚Äôd prefer quieter areas next time.
In all weathers this beach is fabulous,The longest beach every. Walk and walk and walk on firm sand at low tide or walk along the path above. We saw a bit of rain and a very high tide and it was fabulous every time. The beach was closed one day due to the high swell but didn‚Äôt stop walks. Very clean.
Nice and Relaxing,"Just a few minutes walk away from my accommodation, can already enjoy the sound of waves lapping up on the shore. Super relaxing. There were benches along the pathway good for seniors who didnt want to walk on the sand. For us, after coming up from the beach there was a tap area to wash the sand off. Thus, its a nice place to go and relax."
Not for the faint hearted ,"A surf beach is never going to be a place for a non confident swimmer. Nice clean beach, swim between the flags of you do brave the waves."
Great spot to visit,"The GCCC have done a great job re-vamping Surfers Paradise Beach, lots of walking tracks. Highly recommend. Avoid on the weekend if possible as it will be exceptionally busy."
Great beach!,"Very soft sands here, unseen elsewhere in my experience. Very suitable to spend time here in the beach for whole day, only if not that much sunshine, hahha"
Romantic long beachside with very smooth and small sand,"It‚Äôs the best romantic beach for the lovers walking along the beach hand in hand, better not in overhead sun. Highly recommend to go there near sunset, especially in summer time, not too hot. Take off the shoes or slippers, feel the smooth sand with your bare foot. The feeling is wonderful. And feel energetic too when seeing the surfers surf on the waves."
Good area to visit ,"Good place to visit ,markets on Wednesdays not very big market but good to take a stroll and browse some interesting things to buy also heaps of shops and pubs around for good food heaps to see"
Felt safe,Tried to make the most of the beach while on holidays even though the weather wasn‚Äôt playing the game. Still had heaps of fun and found plenty of lifeguards on duty creating a relaxed experience where everyone appeared to enjoy themselves.
Bostinly Golden Sands.,"After visiting Sky Point, we just HAD to go on the beach. Being Brits Aboard, it was great to see the Lifeguards stationed on the beach entrance, with their gazebo, chairs,lookout tower and buggy at the ready!It was really Bostin to just lie back and think, ""yes I am lying here on Surfers Paradise Beach! We felt really safe and secure knowing we were being looked after!"
"Surfers Paradise Beach - Gorgeous, pretty, charming","Surfers Paradise Beach - Gorgeous, pretty, charmingWe landed from flight at Brisbane airport coming from Cairns. By bus we went to Gold Coast. After lunch while coming to VOCO hotel, I got down with wife to enjoy the beauty of Surfers Paradise Beach. During our stay in Sydney and Cairns, we heard about the beach. After seeing the beach I realised that we heard less than the actual. Many birds were playing on beach and were coming to the tourists for grains. The beach is extremely popular to tourists for its multiple attractions. The sand is golden. The beach strip is long (three kilometre length), many high-rise buildings including the world famous Q1 building, with its SkyPoint observation deck. From the deck panoramic ocean and city can be viewed. There are also popular markets, several shops, cafes, diverse restaurants and lively nightclubs. I tried to take photo of the Q1 building. But I did not succeed to take photo of Q1 building due to incapability of my camera. Furthermore, I won‚Äôt feel shy to mention that neck pain developed when I tried to view the Q1. Therefore, tourists get anything they want. The ‚ÄúSurfers Paradise Beach‚Äù is Australia‚Äôs iconic beach. After spending about two hours we started for our accommodation in hotel VOCO. I am attaching few photos."
Beautiful beach we really enjoyed this place. Kids had a ball. Can‚Äôt wait to come back. ,Beautiful beach we really enjoyed this place. Kids had a ball. Can‚Äôt wait to come back. Life guards are really great and look after everyone
Just perfect,Well worth the visit but definite lack of shaded seating beach front. The beach itself is extremely clean and mostly patrolled by lifeguards. Lots of eateries around also
Stunning,Just simple and stunning. So clean and well maintained. Doesn't matter your age it's just beautiful and clean
Pristine beaches,"What lovely clean beaches and safe for the kids to play or take a dip and swim in the ocean, with lifeguards on hand"
Great beach when visiting Gold Coast,"It's always nice to have a break at this beach when we were staying in Hilton or Soul, it's right across the street and plenty of activities. There is also shower and toilet nearby when you finished. Simple get a towel and lying on the beach in a sunny day would be a pleasure during the holiday!"
Magic millions ,"Beautiful beaches, amazing cafes great night life, plenty of activities for the whole family from the theme parks to the beach! It has it all at every budget level!"
Very beautiful beach ,"We spend the whole afternoon there for a swim , the kids were jumping waves . It‚Äôs very clean as well and there was life guard .Sand is soft ."
Surfer paradise beach visit,It's amazing. Beach is clean and Life guards are there.Safe for family and beginers/Tourist.All food outlets are at walking distance.Super.......
Amazing,"We visited on New Years Eve and had a wonderful day, This is one of the best beaches I have ever been on. It was very busy but didn't feel overcrowded, the sand was lovely the sea was clear. However it was very strong and not suitable for young children my 3 year old was able to stand at the waters edge and paddle within arms length. There are sections that are patrolled by the life guards and I wouldn't swim outside this area. Every kind of shop is on the road next to the beach along with a vast array of restaurants/coffee shops. Everything you could want is a short walk away. Parking was easy along the sea front on a parking meter and was $4 an hour. There were showers on along the beach front but were very hit and miss. Would love to return and stay for longer next time highly recommend a visit to anyone who is in the area."
Beautiful beach ,Not really a beach person but surfers‚Äô has its own charm. Always plenty happening. Weather was great and a lot of tourists.
Boxing Day beachtime,"Visited this beach on Boxing Day. If you enter the beach through the main ‚Äúsurfers paradise‚Äù entrance and turn left it‚Äôll be miles quieter than you expect. If you‚Äôre not surfing too, the waves are slightly lower too. Amazingly clean and tidy beach too."
Beaches are a surfers paradise,"I  live in the eastern suburbs of sydney, and i had forgotten how much warmer the water is up here. It is well patrolled and the weather is so good . Better  than hawaii."
Surfing and sea salt,What a beach everybody happy and friendly great place to visit the views are bountiful plenty to do without having to do much walking
Not clean water beach but surly good for surfers.,Had stayed at marriot . 200 mtrs from the beach. Beach had soft cold gushy sand. But to my dissapointment it was not a clean water beach. Not many activities also.
A big beach with very limited facilities,"A long beach with lifeguards on duty but with limited other facilities; there are few rubbish bins, no toilets, no storage facilities, no beachside bars or eateries, no equipment rentals. The high rise blocks of flats immediately next to beach create unwanted shade, so not ideal."
Overrated,"We‚Äôbe been there to see how this world famous place looks like and we‚Äôve been really disappointed.Too much people, McDonalds and other fast foods everywhere... If you want something more juste go √† but southern to Miami, Burleigh heads or tallebudgera."
Amazing place,"Already thinking about how to be back here in the future. Really exciting place, amazing weather and great beaches, restaurants and shops."
Clean beach,A busy beach next to some good surfing waves. Busy location but to be expected as it is popular. Nice beach front walk
nice,"nice place, crowded though, the waves are nice to surf and swim or just chill on the beach. very good place to visit in Australia"
Top class beach with top class life saving,The waves can be a bit choppy with swells and back wash a good proportion of the time but the setting is great. The sand is clean and the seawater is clean. Easy to get to and there is ample parking in the vicinity
Very Nice,Very good experience.Clean and clear beach. weather was perfect and good place to take family for good 2-3 hours.
Beautiful beach,The actual beach is beautiful. Lots of people but still loads of space - great promenade to walk up and down on or even hire a bike.
Crowded but ok ,"Nice family feel and very crowed , not for calm seekers , no Christmas fireworks and extremely expensive food services with 20% surcharge for the same or even less service except for MacDonald and hungry jacks , weather nice , too crowded beach markets , sand excellent limited beach life savers nice beach walk"
Busy but great ,"Huge beach with lots of lifesavers. It may be dangerous to get in the water, but you will always see lots of families and kids. Safe and clean beach!"
Family Fun,We love that they have recently updated the Esplanade and the walking / bike riding paths are so good. We can walk into the restaurants and shopping and bike ride all the way to Sea World and back easily. Life guards to keep us safe and Friday night markets for all to enjoy.
Great place for family fun,"We first went to meet around and ended up going the next day to take the little one to the beach, the beach is clean, lifeguards are nearby making sure everyone is safe, toilet was surprisingly clean, showers are nearby as well as locker services. What we liked the most was that we were just a few meters away from the shopping area so you can have fun indoors while the sun is too hot"
Amazing view,Best views and good climate! Go for surfing or just swimming. Water is clear and beach is really clean
Always fun except during schoolies,"Surfers Paradise is on every traveler‚Äôs must and so it should be. Beautiful beach, lots of shopping options and so much to do. Just avoid the schoolies time when travelling with family"
Lively Beach,I have been to many beaches all over the globe. This was one of the better beaches. We were there both in the morning as well as evening and enjoyed both.
Lovely beach,"Lots of lifeguards around, even in the water with jetski making it safe for the kids to swim. The beach is also very clean, with ammenities nearby."
The beach ,"Awesome beaches , good food, family friendly , clean atmosphere and cold cold beer . Restaurants are pet friendly and views of the ocean are prevalent in most locations. Prices are fair , beaches not crowded except during holidays.....super experience"
Great photo opp,"Surfers Paradise Beach is very popular with tourists, and no wonder: a beautiful, white, clean, sandy expanse, with tempting, golden waters. Plenty of great photo opportunities to be had, with many towering buildings nearby, and coastline as far as the eye can see. There's outdoor markets on the promenade a few times a week. Well patrolled by life guards during the day, so as long as you swim within the flags and don't go out too far you should be safe. There can be a strong cross current and dumping waves, so take care."
Beautiful beach,"Very well worth going to!Clean, well designed, good friendly service.Fast internet everything you could want"
Iconic place,"White sandy beaches as far as the eye can see. Patrolled areas. Close to shopping district, food outlets and and transportation links."
Safe and Sandy Surfer‚Äôs,Still a great beach attracting tourists and locals alike. It‚Äôs a wide sandy beach with moderate surf and areas divided off for surfing or swimming. The lifesavers do an excellent job supervising and advising of potential dangers.
Peaceful,It was a challenge  to  navagate the surf for swimming  as it  was  very rough  and  kept knocking  us down. By the time  you get  up the next  wave hits you.Mainly for  surfers. Great to walk  along and very clean.People very friendly. Still  loved  it.
Epic,"Awesome surf, currents can be challenging so be aware. But the life guards are really friendly and are happy to give advice"
Beach,Ok. Let's me gets straight. This place obviously for surfer and swimming. Why should I come surfer at night. Except for sight seeing and pictures. A little bit of shopping. Eat and clubbing.  There are many street performers.
Nice place to visit when you are at the coast,The beach was lovely and very clean... was nice to have some time here... will be back again. The sand was clean and the sidewalks were kept lovely and cool. The gardens before it were tidy and clean as well.
Beach ,"The sky is blue, and all the leaves were green. I had a swim. It felt nice. Not too sandy, and not too much water. It barely rained at all."
"Long stretch, sun goes down early","Because of the high rises, the sun goes down pretty early.  No shelter on the beach from the waves. Great if you like surfing and waves.  Not great for small children / if you don't like waves!"
Fun fun fun,"We had so much fun in surfers paradise... Even though we are over 50.   Awesome beach, beautiful restaurants and cafes.  Would strongly recommend for a lovely relaxing time."
Family Beach Fun!,"Beautiful, endless beach with soft white sand. Kids were so thrilled by how soft the sand was. They had endless fun with sand and water play. Water points and toilets are conveniently located. Great shopping and eateries found just a stone's throw away.Spent half a day enjoy the sun the sand and the sea!! Lovely experience.... left wanting more!!"
Its a nice beach,"Its a nice beach but more good is its surroundings where lot of pubs , restaurants , shops , ice cream parlors, are to enjoy with view of beach with lot of tourists.  Sun bath is also amazing on the beach , its very clean water and beach side . September is not crowded so there are no sports this time ."
Walking paradise,"the esplanade is a must for strolling in sunshine, observing the surf, other people and chilling out. Lots of seating for if you just want to sit and watch the sea/surfers. The espanade goes for miles along the beach and is being extended soon. There are twice weekly evening markets with something for everyone. Well kept Unisex toilets are available allalong the esplanade as are large wooden bed tyle rests, exercise posts, water bottle filling stations and foot washing facilities to get the sand off. The beack is clean and the tide doesn't go out far. You can learn to surf from experts teachers, ride your hired electric skateboards/scooters or just chill with the birds and beachside cafea and bars."
Beach visit,Incredible great erosion a straight beach not good for surfing swimming so many buts needles in sand but looks picturesq from mall and view north south  good beaches noosa nth straddy southern Gold Coast
Always good,"Plenty of room  for all , lots of locations with lifeguards on duty, parking can be an issue if you turn up late"
A paradise in real sense. ,"The vibes, energy and scenic beauty of surfers paradise is too good to be true. One can feel the pristine waters, carry out a number of outdoor/indoor activities and savour a vide variety of world class cuisine. One of the best places in the world for sure."

Lovely,"Beach was very clean, outdoor showers located a short distance from the sand, lots of cafes and restaurants along the beach front and patrolled by police regularly :)"
Amazing,"There's nothing I look forward to more than coming on holiday and going to Surfers Paradise Beach. The Skyline views from anywhere you sit, the crystal blue water and the golden sands, it's picture perfect. Lifeguards are everywhere for your safety and there's so much room. Can literally come here any time of day and the water is perfect to swim in. Love it."
Great to see all the schoolies...,... having a nice and safe time.  It's a good thing they are welcomed and looked after so well.  It's a part of growing up!  YMMV

Wake Up in Paradise!,Beautiful Beach to wake too.  Take an early morning walk to energise and get your daily dose of vitamin D.  Have a coffee along the way and a quick dip before heading back to work out where lunch will take you.
Surfers Paradise is real Paradise,felt like heaven.beautiful place to spend time with your loved ones.food options and motels was so good.
A gift that keeps on giving ,"I am a local. I love Surfers Paradise beach. I visit most weekends and you can‚Äôt fault the white sands, the cleanliness of the beach and the joy of people enjoying their quintessential GC experience. I love everything about it and coming here is my happy place. A must see."
Sensational Surfers Paradise beach,"We spent our holidays here for years and just loved swimming in the beach and now that we live nearby, we often stroll along the beach and pop into cafes along the way. It‚Äôs a fantastic beach and very touristy."

Sand is super soft,"Soft sandy beach with excellent lifeguards on duty, shark net in place and can even spit whales from the shore some days"
Beautiful Beach,"Stunning beach, fine white sand, and gorgeous waves.  my son loves to play with the waves. for people who does not fond of sun bathing, i guess 2pm is the perfect time to visit the beach as there are shades coming from the high rise buildings and the sea breeze is not as cold if it was sunny during the day.  i think during this month water is still cold to play with.  probably it would be perfect on summer.  but as long as you dont get wet, i guess this month is the perfect time to walk or stay on the beach.  weather is just so refreshing."
Place to be!,"Exactly like in pictures you see on TV. Though at times jammed packed with people, but OK as everyone is friendly."
Amazing Spot,Amazing here. Highly recommend it. Had so much fun chilling here and it's so close to everything! It's so nice there.
Surfers Paradise Beach,"Can get very crowded here, we preferred to go further down away from the crowds with our 3 year old granddaughter but of course if you want to swim you have to stay in main area with the flags, she just played in the sand."
Amazing,"This is what us poms think of when you mention aussie beaches,and we weren't disappointed, mile after mile of sand,spent several hours just watching the world go by.Got up early one morning to watch the sunrise,hard to put into words the view"

Excellent beach,Fantastic clean beach life guards on duty markets to visit.  Crisp clean sand raked and cleaned daily litter free showers and toilets on side walk to ensure you leave the sand behind.  Beautiful views
A great beach to visit in Gold Coast,Really refreshing to be here. Very clean in spite of being the happening place in Gold Coast. Lots of Bars and Restaurants alongside the Beach. The place gets into a festival atmosphere in the evenings with roadside shops opening up selling local goods.
Beautiful ,Beautiful beach within one of the busiest locations on the Gold Coast. Wish we had more time to try the duck boats & electric bikes. Will definitely be back..
Must be in Gold coast,"Nenavstivit Sufers Paradise ked ste na Goldcoaste by bol hriech. Jeho typicka atmosfera, paradna beach walk je must be co treba vidiet. Mnozstvo obchodikov a restauracii, vsetko walking distance."
Stayed for a week ,Stayed nearby for a week and went to the beach most days. Always clean and well managed by lifeguards.
Nice beach with sky scrapers,"It is a nice and relaxing beach, which is very photographic as there is sky scrapers around the beach."
Lovely beech,"Lovely fine sand enormous beech you can walk for miles was quite windy when we were there, but I guess if they never had wind they would not have waves"
Great holiday,Great place to take teens. So many things for the family to do. Everything reasonably priced. Very entertaining
Avoid,"You would have more luck winning Lotto than finding a car park in Surfers Paradise. There are better beaches on the Gold Coast worth a visit. If you do find a park be very, very careful as you just might get a parking fine as I did. I would never go back there again. Palm Beach is much better."
Very windy,"When in the Gold Coast you really have to go to Surfers Paradise beach which we did.  It was quite windy & chilly but worth going to see the waves.  I was expecting to see Surfers but maybe it was a bit early for them, worth a visit"
One of the best beaches in Australia,"The Surfers Paradise Beach hasn't altered for more than 50 years, with a double break and consistent surf to enjoy.  There is plenty of sand to spend time sunbaking, reading, or just people watching."
Awesome beach,"Lives up to our expectations.Beautiful beach right in front of malls, restaurants and bars.Has everything!"
Once was great,"It‚Äôs been our go to place for 5 years twice a year. That‚Äôs until myself, wife were assulted in front of our children. CCTV footage captured the entire event. Local police were no help and we were told no charges will be laid. Obviously trying to keep the crime stats down. We‚Äôll be looking for a safer holiday destination."
Beautiful Beach,"Easy access, close to all amenities lots of shops close by. Great day out! Bring your hats and sunscreen because the sun is hot!"
Best Shoreline ,Best Shoreline and not very crowded in evenings. Street markets around the beach three days a week and lot of eateries and shopping destinations near the beach
Catherine @ The Hilton Surfers Paradise,"Catherine at The Hilton Surfers Paradise is the most friendly and warm person in Surfers Paradise.  Every morning at breakfast we were greeted with a beautiful, genuine smile and nothing was too much trouble for her. She is fast and efficient and so welcoming!"
Beautiful beach to visit ,I visited this in September. I went with my family. It‚Äôs very beautiful beach nicely maintained. Anytime walk will be good but sunrise is fantastic. Beach is not far from market and hotels.
Maria,"Really nice Abit windy but all goodI love the fact that they have areas to swim between the flags, exellent saftey"
Ocean Magic,Magic views of rolling surf super white sand & lots of sunshine. Instagram worthy sunrises & sunsets.
Great,"My last visit to Goldcoast it was more than 22 years ago. Now its has more high rise building, more hotel, and the tram.As the centre of the tourism, Surfers Paradise beach is always the main spot. We do love it so much, its still clean and in a good condition. The white sand is so awesome. My cons: is now we see more homeless man at the front off some shop with they belonging"
Good beach day,"Lots of nice cafes around, beach was really clean and spacious. Great family day out. Good parking . Worth a visit"
One of the best....,"Regardless of the conditions, this is one of the best beaches I have ever traveled to. Not only is the sand pristine but the water is always warm, there's waves most of the time, plenty of life guards patrolling and the views are first class. The kind of place you could easily spend a full day enjoying."
Fantastic first time visit to the Gold Coast!,"Super friendly locals. Beautiful, clean, safe and well organised city. Cool and relaxed ambience. Many choices for food, shopping and entertainment. Recommended for families, group of friends, couples. An experience i really enjoyed and will return!"
Skypoint,"It‚Äôs a must if you are there ,highest point in Australia amazing views of surfers and miles away every where else ,great restaurant I was there for breakfast and it was great ,tickets prices great value , Normal ticket is $27 which gets u in morning and night and went both as I went up to see sunset and whole city lights up"
To expensive ,Great views from the 77 floor.But is way to expensive for what you get when  you get up there.Then they expect you to pay $2 to look through there binoculars what a tipp off.We had lunch up there and that was just ok.ordered trip of dips and came out with  only 2 dips and  bread trio in my day was 3.Went back  to ask for 3rd dip and she said  it's only oil and balsamic. Well don't sell me a trio next time.Sorry way to expensive at  $27 per adult even though it is a great  view.
Beautiful beach and boulevard ,I really liked the beach and the food. The downside was that it was often windy in the afternoon. Maybe better to go there on a later date
Great beach,"Surfers Paradise beach was just lovely. Exactly what I thought it would be. As you walk straight of Cavil Ave onto the beach, there is plenty of places to eat close by and you can hire scooters and pushbikes if you wanted to be a bit more active. Lovely time."
surfers paradise,"truly am glad i followed my wife n daughter for a lovely,therapeutic walk along the world famous surferparadise,easily 2km n went again n again till time to gohome.Amazing sight of people, beach ,seagulls like u feel not moving from there at all.nearbye rows of shops,beer haven, adventure parks, river cruisses ,food  stalls n restaurants on n on FANTASTIC"
Breezy,We walked along the beach front during the night markets.  It was very busy and breezy but enjoyable all the same.  Lots of tourists trying out the local arts and crafts.
A very popular Gold Coast Beach,"Surfers Paradise Beach is one of many iconic beaches on the Gold Coast famously known around the world, it is very popular with tourists, hence it is busy from sunrise and into the wee hours of the morning.  In the afternoon the beach becomes heavily shaded from the neighbouring high-rise buildings, depending on what experience you want at the beach you need to time your visit.  The beach is patrolled."
"Lovely beach, very shady!","Ok it's beautiful, the whole Gold Coast is lovely. However my one bugbear is all the tall buildings that have been built right next to the water front. Whilst it's great for the millionaire owners, those of us who just want to enjoy the beach struggle to get any direct sunlight in the afternoon as the tall buildings shield most of it.So if you want a beach to be a bit chilly and a bit dark, go in the afternoon."
mrs. Ruth beardsmore ,"What can I say,  Gold Coast has some of the most amazing beaches in the world. They also can be dangerous so swim in between the flags.The night life has fine dining,  Entertainment,  Casino shopping,  Gorgeous bars and cafes for breakfast. Also heaps of resorts to choose between which go on budget and taste."
great experience,plenty of great restaurants clean beaches awsome nightlife! we did a road trip to the hills and down to byron bay which was fantastic!
2019,The beach is incredible. Good facilities and life guarding support up and down it. Easy to walk miles down the beach in no time at all.
Fine white sand,Beautiful  broad beach with fine sand. Located right at the end of Cavill Avenue so plenty of eateries nearby. The beach itself  has lifeguards and good shower facilities.
Good luck finding parking,If you can avoid driving in Surfers Paradise it will be a far better experience for you. The road system is a nightmare and parking can be difficult to find. The beach is nice and now we can say we have been there and done it.
Beautiful view ,It is full of tourists and everyone enjoys their own activites. The sand is fine and the waves crashes gently at the shore. Lifeguards are present. There are beach showers available too.
Beach time,"Beautiful clean beach, good amenities close by. Surf lifesaver on site . Learn to surf & lots more to do."
Great for a walk ,Beautiful beach but not at all protected from the swell. Southerly swell meant it was pulling strongly to the left and really not great for swimming
Very nice beach ,A very good and nice beach to stay at. Close to everything and nice food-places around. Very long and beautiful!
Clear Waters,"Surfers Paradise Beach took my breath away. With the city skyline in the background, clean sand and clear waters this was an absolute must stop. Relaxing here after brunch nearby we soaked in the sun. The beach stretches for quite a ways so it is a great walk as well. Highly Recommend."
Wonderful place for kids !,"Water can get rough in afternoons but still shallow enough for youngsters .. paddling, wading and collecting shells .. boogie boarding and every half kilometer there‚Äôs a rescue lifesaver on patrol .. sand castles and very mild weather April to November Great winter space .. Waves break deep in ocean and gently on shore ..shopping in surfers is 6/10 but all the places - including woolies and coles and a great Tram/light rail service that travels between Broad Beach Pacific Fair and Helensvale (Helensvale is gateway to airport and Brisbane )Wonderful place ! No need to venture overseas !"
One of the most beautiful stretches of beaches in the world.,One of the most beautiful stretches of beaches in the world. The beach stretches for miles and miles. Endless beauty.
Must do,"A must do in surfers, beautiful beach and beautiful vibe, close to restaurants and beach markets Sunday, Wednesday and Friday nights!!"
55 kms of Beautful beach,The sand is fine-grained white sand - clean and soft under-foot. Thr shops are only a metres away if you get hungry. And there's plenty of life guards.
Head south for the best beaches,"If you like your beach filled with tourists and towering sky scrapers this beach is okay.  I advise to head south to Burleigh, Currumbin, Kirra or Coolangatta to experience the beautiful beaches and iconic surf breaks. You‚Äôll feel much more connected to nature anywhere other than Surfers Paradise.  Ask any GC local where the best beaches are."
How can you not love this place,"The beach felt generally clean and safe. There are lifeguards during the mornings and afternoons and in the evenings, there are just so many people hanging around and relaxing, you won‚Äôt be alone. Loved that there are night markets 3 times a week, some of the things they are selling are actually quite good. The kids loved the beach, both morning and night. Just be wary that the waves can come in really quick during the evenings, so those with little kids shouldn‚Äôt leave them on their own at all."
Family get away,Plenty to see and do. Great for a relax and walk. Stay central as easy to get to everything with a drive.
Surfers beach,"Absolutely amazing place,beaches continue to next -great for morning walks.clean and friendly.Clean beaches, nice surf,great shops close by.So many attractions and entertainment close by. Everything is so close you can walk scooter or bike to almost anywhere.Surfers is the best place to holiday with lots of memories to make."
Perfect weather,"Escaping winter back home, arrived to perfect ""winter"" in the Surfers Paradise.""What winter?""Much to see and lots of eat. Transport to both the other ends easily available. Tram and buses.Also note there is a free shuttle bus for tourists to the Harbour Town Outlet but u need to book online.  And should u decide to continue to Brisbane, several bus companies available for the 1 hour trip."
Surfers Paradise just beautiful ,"Fabulous walking path, very safe, clean and bathroom stops üòäShops close by and plenty of restaurants /coffee shops to relax"
Home sweet home,I would like to say how wonderful the area has become and that many improvements have been made to the beach... boardwalk is great to walk along!
Lovely beach,"It's a very nice beach in the Gold Coast with many good restaurants & attractions along the beach.The beachfront market (open only on wednesday, friday & sunday) is a good venue to look around with good atmosphere.It's always a nice walk along the beach."
Good Beach to walk along and people watch,"Nice beach, walk watch surfers and people in general. Bit windy while we were there and waves were bit small, but the die hard surfers were still out there."
Lovely beach,But better at Broadbeach and a much nicer atmosphere there too. If you have kids then I would strongly suggest stating outside of central Surfers and just do a day visit there
"Great beach, friendly lifeguards ",Great beach to sit and relax or swim with friendly lifeguards happy to chat to the kids and tell them all about the beach and where is safe.
Reclining benches,We loved the reclining benches at Surfers Paradise and the shops are right behind you. (You could plan a day trip of shopping with relaxation time at the beach!) I wish we had a take away dinner at the beach but a walk afterwards was just as good.
Nice place to chill out,Nice place to chill out.Have so many restaurants nearby.You can take pictures for Instagram at the Surfer Paradise Sign.
Stunning beaches,"An absolute must do for foreigners. Golden white sand for miles, steady waves. Be aware of rips and only swim between the flags as conditions in the water can be dangerous. Patrolled, even in winter!"
Lovely iconic beach,"Great beach, water not too cold in July. Very Brief walk from the Q1 tower. Interesting people watching with many tourist around."
Nicely manicured beach,Always relaxing on the beach here. Clean and tidy compared to in Surfers itself. Amazing sunrises every morning.
Nice and clean,"Nice and clean beach, blue water and a beautiful coastline. Very nice to visit on a warm clear day. Loved it."
Lovely beach,"Beach has good facilities (toilets, seating, bbqs)Nice and clean and close to good restaurants and cafes.Nice place to holiday or day trip"
Love this place,"Every time when we come here, we really enjoy. It's long beach with spectacular view, you can walk many hours. We love it"
very stunning,"me and hubby have a blast of our 3days there in staying in front of the beach , Surfers paradise is kind like ive been in other country but to me definitely one of the best places that ive been around australia so love it and the sorrounding areas are kind safe to walk around even the night time and some shops are 24hours , Will definitely coming back again next time."
White sand clean and tidy ,Nice beach right in front of the heart of town does drop off a bit. Beautiful white sand kept very clean no litter. Lots of bench seats along waterfront and plenty of public toilets. Life savers and plenty of swim and surf schools running. Loved the Lest we Forget Monument
Beatutiful Beach,"The beach is AMAZING, nice to walk from one end to the other.  There is also a fair along the sidewalk on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday's.  Merchants selling various items and nice to stroll through."
Fergus,"We come here for holiday.  Haven't been here since Xmas 2010It changed a bit, but still has that long & beautiful white sand beach It looks so beautiful, especially in the morning when sun rise The 3 nights a week night market is awesome. Great experience for people whom like craft or some thing cool Always live to visiting this area"
Great family fun feel very safe,"Wow what a beautiful beach with life guards seagulls pleasant shared cycling walking path and even saw a whale breech. Lots of people having selfies with very obliging police. Of course got kids at night a throw in the air light and rubber band broke on one, they were way expensive but that had lots of fun and naturally they wanted to chase seagulls. Nice eateries around for all tastes and of course the beautiful Pacific Ocean never lets you down. ENJOY"
Beach üèù,"one of the most beautiful beach with safety and security. Amazing view, Amazing environment, clean shiny and alive. You can see why this is the tourist best spot in the Gold Coast"
The council and life guards do a good job,The beach is nice plenty of people along beach and swimming between flags.Along the street beside the beach the walkway is smooth and flat great for walking.The place is very clean and cleaners doing a good job.Pleasant spot to go.has evening market along walkway
Stunning,Surfers Paradise is just stunning - as a beach its lovely and the cafe/shops around the town are great.  There is an eclectic mix of folk which can be fun to watch.  There are open night markets some evenings and seems to have things going on during the weekend - we were lucky and every day weather wise was stunning (and its winter) so it was just a pleasure to walk along the beach everyday we were there.
World class number 1,"One of the world's best places to be perfect weather in winter, clean and so many activities and great places to eat in the area. World class one of the best places to be"
Drive the blues with bright blue!,What a pretty and welcoming beach ! July has strong sun but clouds do come by and make it cool .. a sight for sore eyes! Lotsa places to shop and eat too !
Beautiful beaches ,"One of the most beautiful beaches on the Gold Coast. Always swim between the flags. The beaches are clean and close to the shops to get food for lunch and drinks. There is volleyball courts to play, and showers nearby to wash off after your swim. There is also toilets there too."
Lovely beach we went during Viva so crowded ,"Lovely beach was very busy when we were there because of Viva Surfers Paradise celebrations, lovely sunny day we went for other reasons so didn‚Äôt swim, but did enjoy a walk along it, very pretty and pleasant"
Viva Surfers Paradise,"A 10 day festival of music along the beachfront at Surfers. Lots of tribute groups and entertainers like the ""Supremes"", ""Elvis"", ""Elton John"". Free entertainment for the most part. A really pleasant experience. Not too crowded. Worthwhile attending."
Awesome beach,Awesome beach to hang out and the kids all loved it too! Beautiful sand and great to see the Life Guards there to help keep everyone safe.
VIVA Surfers Paradise 2019 was a wonderful experience,"Looking forward to VIVA Surfers Paradise 2020 - get in early and book accommodation. This was a great festival, well organised, with a wonderful array of vintage cars, an Elvis Presley event hosted by Dean Vegas, lots of events to suit all tastes, spanning a week or so. Browse the regular, interesting street markets, free music and entertainment. We even saw a white whale passing on its way north. Imagine that! Fabulous, well-run event with a backdrop of pristine white beaches and ocean breezes. Just magic."
Beautiful,"Beautiful clean beach, very well maintained surf life savers and police patrol the beach which makes you feel safer and you can relax"
"The beach is superb, and great to enjoy. ","I have traveled extensively and this stretch of beach beats plenty others I have seen, including Santa Monica, Hoi An, and others. If you are escaping the colder climates of Australia and beyond, this beach will be all you need to feel fantastic. Beautiful clean sand, gorgeous rolling surf, superb sunrises and moonrises, all patrolled by Australia‚Äôs famous surf life savers. Ideal for romantic strolls along the beach. Don‚Äôt forget to swim between the red and yellow flags, and bring your sunscreen and hat. Who says there is nothing to do? Just enjoy the world class beach and stunning vistas."
There's nothing to do here,"Apart from surfing and drinking (of which there are many better places) there's nothing to do here, there's an old shopping strip and that's it. Worst place in Australia so far after travelling around NT and QLD for 2 months."
Great beach on the Gold Coast,Beautiful stretch of beach in the Gold Coast area.  Surfers Paradise is beautiful.  The waves can be rough at times so be careful of that otherwise enjoy the sand and the sea.
Blue Sea Slug Warning,"The beach at Surfers is usually a stand-out on a sunny day - inviting water, a long stretch of white sand flanked by high rise buildings that meet the shoreline.  But in July it's a bit grey, gloomy, windy and cold.  The main reason for my review is that we noticed a lot of bright blue sea slugs in the sand.  Sometimes likened to Pokemon dragons these Nudibranch sea slugs  might look tempting to pick up for a closer look but DON'T  - they're toxic and have a poisonous sting. They are quite rare and beautiful but best to photograph only.  Apart from this hazard - parking is almost impossible close to the beach even in winter."
Very Pretty,It reminds me of San Remo or Mornington by all its endless sands & openness.The Esplanade is a very nice stroll night or day.Be on the Look out for the Night Markets.  Good stuff there.
This is the Gold Coast,"This is an incredible stretch of coastline, the views are amazing. Sunrise and sunset offer distinctly different perspectives. The ocean is clean and clear...the sand is fine...."
A great place to start your day!,"Surfers Paradise Beach is squeaky white sand and stunning, a great way to start the day with a walk along the shoreline from Surfers Paradise to Broadbeach for breakfast! There are patrolled swimming  areas all along the beach for safe swimming. Head north to Main Beach and again you are spoiled for choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Spend a weekend, a week or relocate to the best place to live in Australia."
Great Weather on Sufers,"On a good Winter's Day, the Surfers Paradise Beach is spectacular and enjoyable. Also proximate to great eateries. Pleasant boulevard although have to keep an eye on fast electric bikes, electric scooters and bicyles. Well accessible by public  transport, including trams. Great city for a beach and city holiday."
2 day stay,"Having all weathers during our visit we still enjoyed our walks along the beach. Watching the surfers and swimmers,  the changes in colour of the sea and sky remarkable. Just a lovely warm relaxing place to visit and unwind"
Dog walk before dawn,Wow it‚Äôs blowing on this beach this morning! But how can you go wrong on a Gold Coast beach? Still perfect
Beautiful,"Even on a rainy day...no rubbish, well taken care of. Markets and activities are great in the area.  Felt safe on this beach. O"
Surfrrs Paradise,We love surfers paradise .there is lots to do even if the weather is rainyBeaches and facilities are great
Had a great time,Went to Surfer's Paradise for a surprise birthday party. We had a couple of nights to ourselves where we did some shopping and got something to eat at Charlie's. Food was great as was the whole experience on Cavil and the beach. Would do it again.
Amazing feeling and ecperience,"First time visit to Surfers Paradise and this is one cool place. A bit of weather warning when we arrived but the feeling is amazing, clean beach, all family friendly. Next to so many shops and eatery. Went there at night time too and enjoyed every bit of it with the family. Highly recommend if you in Gold Coast. At least spend a day or two in Surfers Paradise."
INNOCENT ABROAD,"Lovely golden sand.   It must have been quite magnificent before being spoiled with all the highrise buildings casting afternoon shadows on the beach.  Was surprised at the bank of sand which made a difficult slope for older people to get up, so had to walk further along the beach to avoid it."
Huge improvements since my last visit,"I had not been to Surfers Paradise for a number of years until recently because it had got quite dowdy and run down and did not have the best reputation locally. However, things have changed and the council really looks like it has invested and improved things a lot since I last saw it. There is a beautiful long esplanade to walk along the beach. We did a 5km walk from Surfers Paradise to Broadbeach and you can walk along the beachfront for about 80% of this distance. The beach itself is beautiful and clean. At sunrise you will fine a lot of people out walking along the beach. It is patrolled with life guards and there are plenty of toilets and shower facilities along the front, close to the beach. It is a really excellent spot now."
Great days,"The view from the water was amazing. The tram was great, the buses need new springs and dampers but are very regular. The food is generally good and rices reasonable for a good feed for lunch"
"Golfing,Racing trip","Location on the Gold Coast meets all our needs,Broadbeach location near beach,next to Tram service,close to Casino,and near to Pacific Fair"
Paradise,Nice beach to walk along any time of day or night especially great to watch the sunrise from whilst relaxing.
Beautiful,The beach at Surfers Paradise is beautiful and clean. There are always life guards on the beach so you feel save in the water. There are plenty of toilets and places to get food and drinks near by.
Fantastic Beach! ,We are not a surfing family but we enjoyed walking along the beach and around the area. The beach itself has fine fluffy sand comparable to our Philippines‚Äô Boracay Beach. My 8-year old son enjoyed chasing after the seagulls along the beach. We also enjoyed strolling around the shops and restaurants around the area. Definitely the best place to stay when in Gold Coast!
Clean and well maintained,A nice place to walk and spend time with family and friends.Many access points to the beach where the sand is literally squeaky clean.Nice water and clearly marked where it is safe to swim.
A good place to be for all ages,It‚Äôs definitely a good place to exercise for all ages. The coastline is so clean and safe even during wee hours in the morning.There are also some nights in a week with night markets and it somehow liven up the atmosphere!It‚Äôs a good place to go to for relaxation and exercise.
May was perfect weather- I even got to swim in the ocean,Warm- 26%- perfect weather...clean- picturesque- friendly beach....was happy to share the journey ..
Nice fine sand!,The beach still looks great after my revisit after more than 10yrs! Remember that they don't allow pets to be on the beach when we were back then but it seems that they have open up this rule for the pet lovers to share the beach with their furries.
Perfect to watch sunrise ‚òÄÔ∏è,"Such a beautiful spot to watch sunrise ‚ù§Ô∏è The city is alive with early morning cyclists, walkers, joggers and photographers. As a local I love it here!"
Pretty but crowded,"Although the entire coastline is beautiful white sand beaches, this beach is very crowded. You would do better to head north and pick any one of the beaches dotting the coastline for a more relaxing experience."
After Sydney Surfers Paradise is Austrlia's number one holiday destination for Austarians and number 2 for international,"This city marries International standard Theme Parks with nature at its best. The Surfers Paradise strp couples long beaches of golden sands with miles of safe surfing beaches that are always fully patrolled. Then a mere 400 meters inland there are waterway edged with immaculate private residences. Daily cruises along the canals is  not to be missed. Plenty of accommodation offering a wide range of pricing. The Australian food is wonderful - especially the seafood which is extremely fresh and with a  wide variety. Try Ashmore Steak and Seafood, you won't be sorry."
Best beach in the world,The finest white sand coupled with clean and clear surf and gorgeous climate makes this beach my absolute favourite hands down
Stunning Surfers,"Love the esplanade, we ride from Ashmore often, there is plenty of bike lock up areas and toilet facilities.  There are showers by the beach and loads of seating areas.  The beach is patrolled by Life Guards and the sand and beaches just beautiful, lovely atmosphere and loads of places to eat and drink."
Clean n crisp,Surfers paradise is actually a paradise for surfers. The beach has clear blue waters and roadside shacks are also pleasure to shop local things. Very lively beach.
Lovely,"Reminds me of Mount Manganui in New Zealand . Very lovely views, incredible sunrises and very safe feeling. Clean and with life guards. Haven't swum in it yet though."
Lovely,Beautiful beach and clean.  Heavy rip tides so not really able to swim but there were experienced surfers having a good time.  The shops are a bit ratty and too touristy for us so we stayed on the sand most of the time.
"A MUST DO WHEN VISITING THE FAMOUS GOLD COAST -  "" THE ESPLANADE ""","I dont think there are to many stretches of beach anywhere in the world that are as pretty and maintained as perfectly as this one.Easy walking on a level surface make this a excellent pastime along the forshore, whether it be a daytime walk or a romantic stroll after dinner. Easy to get to, and safe."
Leisure,"Great views, friendly locals and easily accessible üëçüëç would definitely recommend anyone of all ages"
"A Broad, Flat Ocean Beach","A very busy coastal strip adjoins this broad strip of golden Australian sand. While the beachside shopping precinct might be a bit tatty, the sands are well maintained and patrolled. The actual surf is a little ho-hum on all tides."
Beautiful beach!,"I've been to a number of beaches around the world, and this is one of the most beautiful. I like when beaches are cared for by the city, and it was obvious that this clean beautiful beach is diligently cleaned/sifted. The incredible skyline on the beach adds to the uniqueness, and there is so much to do. I only discovered this beautiful area of Australia because friends invited me to a conference. I didn't know much about the Gold Coast. Wow!"
Still worth a visit,We returned after a 6 year gap and the place has certainly grown. Not as good as our previous visit but still a fabulous place. The beach is amazing and there are plenty of places to eat and shop
One of the best beaches in the world!,"This really is one of the best beaches in the world.Its clean, has shark nets and goes forever.The sand is beautiful. No importing sand here!You can walk for miles and miles. The water is pristine and is never colder than 19 degrees Celsius and goes up to 28 degrees Celsius in the summer. You should always swim between the surf lifesaver flags. Always use sunscreen and wear a hat. There is no way you could be disappointed with this beach experience."
Iconic beach ,"It has been a long time since we were here last but it still is an amazing beach! It‚Äôs the only beach that the sand squeaks under your feet as you walk.With the white sand and a gentle surf at the right time it is a great place for all the family in or out of the water, a must visit."
Visit,Love Surfers Paradise. Great eating places and beach. Always something going on in town. People pleasant
Great Beach,"I really like this Beach. Well patrolled , looked after and right across the road from anything you may need through the day."
Beautiful place,"Well, let‚Äôs just say amazing ocean views in the day, always busy and good facilities for beach goers. Showers, toilets, but most of all nice warm sand. So good to take the stress away."
So busy! ,"It‚Äôs lovely place to visit, parking is hard to get & super busy especially during events. But it is one of the biggest tourist places"
Great beach,"Great beach to swim or just simply to stroll on, Lovely view to take photos too. Many restaurants and cafes nearby too."
"Super beach, great place",Visiting from the UK I just had to go for a swim off the beach at Surfers Paradise (I haven't put any pictures of me swimming so as not to put people off!) The beach is well patrolled and the flagged areas where it is safe to swim were obvious so as long as you are careful there should be no problems and swimming in the waves there is just fun.There is also a lot going on behind the beach with cafes and shops galore.I suppose it is what is often referred to as an iconic place!
It is really a paradise for the surfers,One of the most happening bachfron of Goldcoast. Has a lot of streetshops and provides a nice and beautiful walk.
Stunning view,Long stretch of beautiful beaches with nice view of the skyscrapers at the back. The only issue is the parking space unfortunately.
Not even remotely a paradise,"The Gold Coast City Council should be ashamed. We stayed a few days and were sad to see how seedy and run down central Surfers Paradise has become. However if you want to immerse yourself in Asian culture, along with many restaurants and businesses catering to this demographic then it is just like visiting Beijing - but without the crowds.  Head further south for better hotels, shopping and restaurants."
Perfect spot,Perfect for a holiday always something to do. Weather is fantastic. Good shopping precinct and lots of variety.
Beautiful beach,"Great place for all ages, well patrolled by lifeguards, easy access to dining and shops from main beach"
Souless Paradise,"This is part of the long stretch of beaches along the Gold Coast. Apart from a small strip of parkland, high rise buildings are built right up to the beach. There is lots of sand, surf and the odd life guard tower, with lots of tourist taking selfies. It is just one long beach with no character ‚Ä¶ everything seemed sterilised. It is unnaturally lit very brightly at night. Don't even think of spotting any nocturnal wildlife. There are better beaches than Surfers, or most of the beaches in the Gold Coast for that matter."
Had to be seen,Actually not all that dramatic but had to be seen. We parked up and wandered along a stretch of the beach to see the surf huts decorated with some pictures showing the past history of the beach.
Clean and perfect,"A stroll after dinner, and also the next day. Happy people and magic weather. Perfect way to spend some genuine time with a partner. And plenty of venues nearby for dining."
Most Popular Beach For The Youth,"Highly attracted place for the tourists and each season more and more people select Surfers as their destination.Beach is very neat and tidy.

Beautiful Beach,"This place is full of life, bustling with surfers and beach goers. We loved this place. There are PLENTY of place to eat as well as there are flea markets on the coastline by the street. Had the best fish and chips. Highly recommend."
This beach is amazing!,You have to come here! An absolute essential thing to see when in the Gold Coast. Get some surf lessons (from Go Ride a Wave) - totally worth it!
A day on Surfers Paradise Beach,I am not a person who generally wanders the beaches....but on this day a beautiful day I walked for about 3 hours up and down the beach! A funtastic experience
Beautiful Beach,"Lovely beach, background views are unreal. There‚Äôs also very nice sunsets there. The sand is perfect. However sometimes later in the afternoon the building create shade over the beach."
"Christmas on the beach, what?!","It's a lovely beach anyway for sure, however I was there at christmas so I was lucky to be there for the carols on the beach event which was epic! But the views out to sea and back to surfers from anywhere on the beach is lovely. & they have the beach markets of course. Whats not to love?"
A beautiful and relax beach,The beach is very clean and safe. Beautiful white sand. Enjoyed the beach walk and picture taking. A nice beach for relaxation .
Lovely beaches!,Lovely beach I love to look up at the sky rise buildings n hear the small planes n helicopters fly over..always action out on the water! The atmosphere is different their to any other beach. The night markets r awesome!!!
One of the finest of beaches,"GC is a favourite Australasian destination, long sandy beaches, white sand, and lots to do. Surfers Paradise is a busy spot with plenty of action. We walked along the beach from Surfers to Broad Beach about 6 kms away and it had a wide selection of Bars restaurants, entertainment on the beach, dance shows etc. With a $10 Go card you can hop on to the tram all day and pick your spot to visit. Best place to chill out, experience the surf and the sand!"
Lots of rips,Lovely beach but be very careful. Not recommended for small children or even adults that are not so good at swimming. Lots of rips although there are life guards the sand disappears before your feet and lots of unevenness. Lots of sections closed for swimming due to these rips. We ended up just paddling. Pool is a better option for small children etc.
Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach, white sands, clean beach, and a lot of restaurants or pubs here, nice place üèñÔ∏èüòäüòâ‚õ±Ô∏è"
Great place,Love the long and wide strand it‚Äôs always clean and the surf lifesavers doing a great jobHave been to many beaches around the world but this one is one of my favourite
Surf & Coffee,"For just over six years now I have got to know the Esplanade & beach quite well at Surfers Paradise. There's always something happening throughout the year with many events to suit everybody. Great beach with lifeguards, though it's renown to be not the safest with a strong current for many. Do play it safe & swim between flags if not confident in water, it can be quite calm one day & raging two meter plus strong surf the next day! There a number of great caf√©s, restaurants & shopping malls in the area. For the party goers there are venues also to suite. People do have a love/hate relationship with Surfers,but does hold a special place in my heart due to many great sessions surfing with mates & coffee afterwards, plus a life saving situation one year surfing there. Parking is all around & also the GLink tram passes right through central Surfers Paradise also, get there & enjoy!"
Awesome ,"Having visited several beaches in different countries, I did not had any anxiety and planned only one day for Gold Coast.But when I entered the beaches of Gold Coast, I found the same amazing.The cleanliness and the white sand was inviting you to spend hours.An unforgettable experience, which I will cherish for ever."
Surfers Paradise Live 2019,"Great concerts, very well organised free music on beach and entertainers in streets of surfers. Well worth the visit."
Great place,"a great place for a stopover, a comfortable place in the city center close to the place of business that I visited, and thank you to the restaurant staff who always serve friendly and the food is delicious"
Must visit even if you are a traveller from other country or state,"Enjoy in the water day time and a beautiful walk in the night. I believe Surfers Paradise beach is a must visit place in Australia either you are a solo traveller, a couple or with family. There is Night market along the beachside on Wednesday, Friday, Sunday which is fun.I recently visited Surfers with my partner, we spent our day at the beach swimming, having fun roaming around, visited the night market and had a relaxing massage at our favorite place Virtue Massage, dinner, and Shisha at boulevard shisha lounge. Had a Great day with lots of fun!!!"
2nd home away from home.,The Gold Coast has always been welcoming and pleasant to holiday with our family or just a quick getaway with just myself and the wife.
Autumn walk along the beach,"A few days after ANZAC day we went to Surfers Paradise and took a walk along the beach. It‚Äôs just such a chilled place, people enjoying the sunshine and the water, surfers trying to catch a wave and children building sand castles. We stopped to look at the ANZAC memorial and the recently placed wreaths.The day we were there they were setting up the evening market on the prom.I was only there for the day but was eyeing up the apartments for future holiday let‚Äôs! There looked to be plenty of them."
Surfers Paradise,Good markets and good shopping and good food and good hare beading and good tram stop and good place
Iconic Beach,"What more do you want? Surfers Paradise Beach is among the nicest beaches, though sometimes it gets busy but in April it was reasonably populated. The water was a bit coolish but nevertheless it is just relaxing to walk on the sand close to the water."
Beautiful Beach,This beach is absolutely beautiful and kept up well for the amount of tourists that come through there! Lots of shops and cafes!
Nice,"the beach is really nice and clean, the night view is amazing, it makes you feel calm.It is close by the shops and a lot of people will be selling beautifully hand made products."
Popular beach point ,"It‚Äôs a popular beach point with many restaurants and bars around ! It‚Äôs crowed and you can find bikes to rent , surf class and boards as well"
Great family fun ,We had some great family fun in the afternoons running around and swimming in the beach. From 3pm onwards it‚Äôs in the shade of the buildings which is nice. The water temperature in April was 25 degrees and it was really nice. While the ocean was a bit rough and there were some rips the lifeguards were always keeping an eye on everyone and keeping us informed.The beach was nice and clean and it‚Äôs was a great way to spend with family.
