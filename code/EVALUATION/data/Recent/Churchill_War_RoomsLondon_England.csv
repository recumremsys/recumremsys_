A place of historic significance that will teach you a lot about WWII's way of life,"We discovered this place, funnily enough, for a Valentine's day special. They had organized a whole event night, with dancers and dance classes from the 30's-40's, and an underground bar, everyone was supposed to dress up in the WWII style, it was really awesome. The exhibit itself is really fascinating, if you're a history buff, this place is for you. It has been preserved as it was during the war, and it's a great visual learning tool for kids too. It really makes history come alive. Loved it!"
History  made really good ,Good place to visit 4 all especially  history geeks and good gift shop 4 all and not too dear i found
Informative and interesting tour,Spent a couple of hours at the War Museum and it was very informative and interesting. Due to  Coronavirus I understand the museum was unusually quiet but it meant we could walk through each section at our leisure.The restoration of the rooms and their contents were the most inspiring part of the tour and great to add more of a background to the recent film.
Interesting ,"Very interesting tour, though it was a little unclear at times the route to follow to get the best experience.All staff very friendly"
Excellent visit,"Very interesting, spent just under 2 hrs going around. Hard to believe a war was planned from a basement with such basic equipment.  Fascinating place."
"This is an absolute must see. Its worth every penny.
You will be happy you visited.","Give yourself a minimal of 2 hours, if you have time 2.5 to 3 hours. The museum is fascinating and you need to take your time, there's so much to see and read.It's both fascinating and humbling to see how people coordinated the war effort 24/7 and only 80 odd years ago too! A morning very well spent."
Interesting historical exhibition,"Fascinating insights into Churchill's life and career, and how the war was run from cellars under WhitehollFascinating insights into Churchill's life and career, and how the war was run from cellars under Whiteholl"
Fascinating!,It was my husband that wanted to visit here but I wasn't sure that I would enjoy it - how wrong I was.   Absolutely fascinating!  We spent two hours but could happily have stayed longer.
Well worth it,"If you are remotely interest in one of the most culturally and historically significant periods in British and European history, and you have an interest in famous figures and how they deal with those periods in history, then this is a fine visit for you.  Walking through the corridors of the underground monument you get a clear sense of importance.  The exhibition about Churchill himself is incredible; detailed, informative and enlightening - I reckon even a Churchill expert would learn something.  A highlight is the original door to Number 10 before anti-terror measures were installed."
Churchill War Rooms,Really interesting experience. Would recommend for anyone interested in Churchill and visiting London.
interesting facts,Lot of things to discover here. Off the beaten paths from main touristic attractions. also good for kids from 10 yo I would say.
Interesting vist,We visited in August 2020 as London was very quiet. Interesting place to visit and see where the control room for WW2 was! helpfull staff and great social distancing. You must book
Very informative ,"Wanted to come here for a while after watching the film. Did not disappoint at all! We learnt so much and the atmosphere felt very real when walking around.  Using the hand held guides was very easy and learnt a lot. Took a good hour and a half to go around, but would of taken much longer if we looked into everything properly.  Very much worth a look."
Churchill Rooms,"Well worth the look, get there early before crowds. We bought tickets on line so skipped the cue. Not a fan of the listening devices rather walk around at my own pace and read.  Absolutely fascinating."
Enlightening ,"Visited the Churchill war rooms a couple of days ago and wasn’t sure what to expect but it was rated highly on trip advisor so gave it a go. Thoroughly enjoyed it and found it informative and enlightening. We have previously been to Alcatraz in San Francisco, wall museum at check point Charlie in Berlin and the War remnants museum in Vietnam but we have never done our own history. Would recommend a visit and it is probably one of the best ways to spend a couple of hours on a wet day in London"
Interesting visit,"The historical significance of Churchill’s War Rooms is unquestionable, and it was great to tour the tunnels from where he commanded troops, legions and made the critical wartime decisions that positively affected our futures. However, I must say the audio guide and tour felt slightly repetitive after a while. I came away without too much new knowledge of Winston Churchill to tell you, but having visited the War Rooms is an experience in itself."
Amazing,A very fascinating look into our history. Well worth the visit and I highly recommend it. Buy online before you attend to avoid the queue.
Fantastic visit. Makes you proud,Have been wanting to do this visit for some time and we were not dissapointed.It really is a fantastic insight into the life and times of a Great Britain.Great displays and thoroughly enjoyable.Can't recommend it highly enough
1pm,"We visited today as family with teenagers and throughly enjoyed the visit. Great audio tour and we all learnt loads and could have stayed longer as so much to see. The visit was really enhanced by a volunteer helper Lee Harris who was very knowledgable and helpful, telling us lots of interesting stories and showing us how to get the most out of the different exhibits. Thank you so much. Highly recommend a visit to this very interesting museum. Very COVID friendly too."
Very interesting part of history,"I loved this tour it was totally unexpected very informative and interesting about a special part of British history,"
Really unique museum,Spent a good three hours learning about the cabinet war rooms and reading through all the information in the Churchill museum. Staff are friendly and helpful. The lay out has changed to make it one way because of Covid so was a bit confusing. Could do with the regular signs being covered up whilst the new one way system is in place. The audio tour is really informative.Really enjoyed our visit here - make the effort to come and bring the children.
Not to be missed - so much to see,"Tucked away underneath the Treasury Building, with its entrance beside the Clive Steps is one of the most fascinating museums in London.  I had not visited the War Rooms for many years, so thought I would take the opportunity to revisit.  The Cabinet War Rooms themselves are fascinating but, since my last visit, it has been extended with an extensive exhibition on the life and achievements of Sir Winston Churchill, worthwhile visiting in its own right, with so much to see. The underground complex of the Cabinet War Rooms was the hidden nerve centre for Churchill and his Cabinet during the Second World War.Construction began in 1938, including substantial strengthening above against the possibility of being hit in a bombing raid, and the War Rooms came into use in August 1939 before Britain declared war on Germany, being vacated only in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan.The War Rooms were a self-contained complex of working, operational, dining and sleeping accommodation, and were left as they were when the door was locked in 1945.  With the aid of descriptive texts, photographs and figures from the period, you can close your eyes and imagine that you were here during the Second World War.  I particularly love the signs which have an informal charm to them, necessitated by circumstances at the time. Having been opened to the public as a unique piece of our history in 1984, there was the further major expansion in 2005 to include the extensive museum on Sir Winston Churchill with a wide range of things to see including his Nobel Prize, his paintings, uniforms and other personal effects and of course one of his characteristic Havana cigars, plus there is also the original oak door for No 10 Downing Street which was replaced with something more able to withstand a mortar or bomb attack in 1991.For anyone interested in history, this must be on their 'to do' list."
Very enjoyable and interesting,"My family and I had a great experience at the Churchill War Rooms. Under the current times of Covid 19 we were a little apprehensive about going, however it was handled very well by the friendly staff and the museum was easy to navigate and at no point did it ever feel crowded!  We met the Visitor Experience Coordinator who was very helpful and knowledgeable about Churchill and the Second World War which enhanced our experience greatly. We ended up staying there for 4 hours with so much to see and read! I would highly recommend going, it's such an interesting and important place to visit."
Amazing slice of history ,My daughter loved the rooms. It feels like you're walking through history rather than wonderful round a museum. Great narrative.
Well worth a visit.,A very interesting a well prepared museum. No concerns around being over crowded and unlike other museums we visited this week all of the exhibits were still open and accessible.The exhibition devoted to the life of Churchill was particularly good and my teenage daughter was in there for ages.
Churchill Would Be Proud!,"Don’t be worried about social distancing in the corridors, guys, they’ve got it organised brilliantly with an efficient one way system, plentiful hand sanitiser stations and the option to buy a mask if you don’t have one to hand. Staff were friendly and made me feel welcome (especially the gent with a majestic beard who sold me a beautiful tote bag) and the exhibits are as captivating as ever. Only downside was they didn’t have the audio tour in American."
Great place to visit.,"Me and my family had a great couple of hours here. Currently there’s a one-way system and hand sanitizer in every block. You’re provided with audio phones that tell you about each room which is very interesting. There are so many facts and stories everywhere and you learn a lot so I definitely recommend this place if you’re a history student or are interested in this. You also get to see items he owned. Staff are friendly and helpful too. There was a volunteer who came and helped us out and was telling us about Churchill speeches. Great place, 100% recommend."
Interesting but I would rather not listen to everything ,This was a very interesting and immersive experience. My only criticism would be that all of the information regarding each room i would rather read it than listen to a recorded speaker or have a guided tour.But beyond that I would go here again!
No social distancing,"This was my third visit in a decade, treating my partner this occasion for their birthday. Even though there were signs up re social distancing, and we all had different time slots, our visit was ruined. We had the 1.30 slot and as we walked through, we came across a large backlog of visitors in the room of photos,  just before the museum rooms. The backlog of people was because one of the guides spoke at lenghth, not giving any thought to more and more people piling into the room, not being able to move forward. At the end, when he said ""I might have gone on a bit' there were up to 30 people in a room approx 12 x 16ft, giving zero opportunity to social distance. Two other members of staff were standing in a corner chatting to each other, oblivious to what was going on. Please train your staff to set a good example?."
Second visit 32 years after the first!,Due to Covoid 19 I decided not to holiday abroad this year. Hence I decided to visit and re-visit areas of interest closer to home. The War Rooms have expanded since my first visit in the late 80's. I really enjoyed the presentation on Churchill's life which includes lots of interesting facts and artefacts. For instance I didn't know he was involved in the Boer War or had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. The War Rooms aren't busy at present and are definitely worth a visit to establish why Churchill is regarded as such an outstanding individual.
Worth a visit,"I went with my son's, on arrival we had to leave contact details, once inside it is set out just as it was during the war,  you get to see where Churchill ate slept and recorded his famous speeches.  There is also the churchill museum which houses his famous hat amongst other things. We did have to wear masks and there was hand sanitiser in lots of places."
Brilliant,Can spend as long as you want and would take hours to read every bit of history. Vast majority of info is in the Churchill part of the museum but fascinating to see what life was like underground during the war.
Worth it,Definitely in my top 5 places to go to when in London. Really informative and interesting to see how the bunkers were laid out during the war.
Just amazing history,"Would recomend The War Rooms to everybody.It's like walking back in history as well as thinking you are actually there .All the rooms were life like and very intereseting,Using a hand held phone to explain all the details was easy to work and very informative.Staff were friendly and helpful."
Walk back in time...!,"Being a Churchill fan and a bit of historian, I always wanted to go the war rooms. And they did not disappoint, everything is preserved so beautifully that it feels like transported back in time! I can't imagine living in that era and what decisions made in those rooms that we still need to be thankful for!"
Great visit,"Really interesting, much bigger than expected.  One way system for covid.   Well worth a day trip.   Wear a mask and go do it.  Toilets available.  Gift shop bit disappointing."
Museum ,"Very interesting museum, I had really good lesson oh history about Second World War. You need to go and see"
Immersive experience of WW2 era,"Visiting Churchill War Rooms gives you a unique sense of how the British leaders lived and governed during World War 2. On top of really well preserved rooms, the experience is completed by uncountable real audios and detailed texts of each year during that era. For history lovers, curious people or anyone who would like to understand how hard and different things were not that long ago, this Museum gives you a great perspective."
The War Rooms experience,I am a history buff and had been looking to visit this site for a while but you don't need to know a lot about Churchill or the second world war to enjoy the experience. The experience is really well laid out and it's amazing to imagine what great events were plotted from this very basic space. The Churchill experience is enlightening for all levels even if you know quite a lot about the subject and it's presented in a very accessible manner. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours. Word of warning if you use Google maps to get here is that the verbal directions will take you to a part of the treasury which is next door. This can be somewhat embarrassing. There is only on e toilet also which will mean you need to circulate the entire exhibit if you find you need the facilities mid exhibit.
Interesting,Very good value for money and an interesting visit best suited to people who know very little about Winston Churchill as I have a reasonable knowledge of the great man it was slightly less interesting to me but never the less still very good value and well worth a visit
Hidden in Plain View (a great turn of phrase),"The Staff were pleasant and engaging and it was an  interesting and informative experience overall.  To me it was not about whether one reveres Churchill or not, the museum was a depiction of how government behaved in an extreme emergency situation.Great turn of phrase: 'Hidden in Plain View'. During WW2 the govt of the day moved into this bunker just around the corner from Downing Street to outfox the Nazis.  See if you can spot a bit of Stoke-on-Trent 'Hidden in Plain View' inside Churchill’s bedroom"
Fascinating,"This is a fascinating experience and a wonderful opportunity to learn more about Winston Churchill. The exhibitions are laid out well and there is definitely plenty to see!Entry is by timed tickets which is necessary as the war rooms themselves are quite cramped and even with the limitations, it can still be difficult to squeeze past other visitors and see all the exhibits. This was a great experience and definitely makes you appreciate the sacrifices these brave men and women went through to get us through the war!"
Krakow,"I like to recommend my agent Magda from Krakow, by helping me arrange a details and helping me in each and every respect"
Excellent museum - interesting and authentic,This is a must visit for anyone in London and with even a passing interest in WW2 or British history.  Fascinating.
You can feel the history,I love this place.  Went about 5 years ago and again this year.  To feel what it must have been like during those dark days when Churchill was under pressure to agree peace terms and refused.  I really piece of living history
Brilliant history,"A really fantastic trawl through time here. We visited one afternoon (make reservations online, don't just show up) and enjoyed our experience.The museum is essentially in two parts: the first is a tour through the bunker rooms which were used during the war, and the second part, a detailed history of Churchill's life and times. Both parts are interesting in their own respects. As far as the life of Churchill goes, there isn't much I can say that can't be read online, but the war rooms themselves ought to be experienced. They are a fascinating look at the coalface one of the most important episodes in the 20th century."
Controversial right now?,Not sure how people are responding to all the hubbub the Americans are putting up but really a fascinating look into the mind and soul of a bygone era. worth a visit
History at its best,Amazing for any history buff or just someone who likes to relive something significant. Really engaging and enjoyable.
Amazing window into history,This was an amazing place.  We spent about an hour but you could easily spend 2-3 hours if you had the time.  There any so many exhibits to see and read about.
Excellent,Good good good just amazed would defiantly recommend to everyone everywhere at any time I mean amazing so just 👍
A must see to get what Britons went through in their darkest hour.,"Plan some time, read and listen to how life was during WWII for those charged with protecting Great Britain."
One of the best museum experiences in London,"I did a self guided tour. Had no idea what to expect but I really enjoyed it and learned a lot! There's so much history down there and you get a real feel for what it must have felt like to be in London during the war.The museum is really well curated and has a lot of very cool items, including the Number 10 door from when Churchill was PM.I got my tickets in advance. Your phone won't work once you're inside the doors so make any calls/texts on the outside before you begin (they work a bit by the restroom off their wifi I believe though)."
Breathtaking,I think that this branch is the best one of the Imperial War Museum with and amazing  historic underground
Fantastic tribute to Churchill,"This museum is a great tribute not only to Winston Churchill, but also to the people who worked in those rooms during the dark days of World War Two. The museum is divided into two parts. First one is decicated to Winston Churchill himself: story of his life and items connected to him. Second part is dedicated directly to the War Rooms, giving to the visiors a great chance to see and understand how did people work in the War Rooms. Overall, it's a great attraction to visit in London."
Church's war-room bunker,Churchill was a man of great insight and excellent speaker. Lots of information to absorb at this underground war room. Great collection of artifacts.
Amazing!!,"So much history, he had the once in a lifetime experience to go behind the glass. The knowledge and wealth of information that was provided is amazing. #maitlandtoldme"
Full morning self-guided tour,This museum has the history of Churchill in intimate detail. The displays are very informative and very complete. Seeing where he and his staff lived during the London Blitz was inspiring. The technology was impressive for the time. I found it amusing that Churchill enjoyed daily champagne despite the hardships of war.  I highly recommend a visit to the War Rooms.
A good visit,"Although not the cheapest to visit it is definitely an interesting museum. Not a fan of Churchill, but quite fascinating to see how his staff worked 18 hours a day during the war. The museum still has original rooms intact. Quite good."
Interesting tour,For history buffs and those you want to become one. Very interesting tour through Churchill's war rooms.
Great History Lesson,Visited Churchill’s War Rooms early in the day when the crowds were still in bed. Totally enjoyed learning more about the history of WW2 and the part Churchill played in this war and his history too.  Original rooms gave an excellent impression of how their lives were lived in this period..thoroughly enjoyable.
Mohammed Arjomandkhah ,"You see the past in small area today , you feel his presence in the room and you admire his courage which is not going be repeated."
Churchill,It was brilliant and bought everything to life about WW2. Book to go early well worth every penny with good guides.
Utterly Fascinating,We spent hours in the Churchill War Rooms--the museum is top notch and endlessly interesting.  Even people who don't know much about World War II will appreciate it.
Fascinating -- don't miss it,I found all of it fascinating -- from the bunker-style rooms to the explanation of Churchill's life and legacy.  You don't have to be a history buff to find it very moving and engaging.
Excellent,"I was last here in the 1980’s and it has expanded quite a lot since then. It was really interesting and most will enjoy the experience. There are lots of exhibits, many of which you can interact with that explain and cover the period of the war."
Give yourself time!,"The Churchill War Rooms were mentioned by a few of my history loving friends as I was preparing my trip to London. My knowledge of Churchill was limited to his role in WWII, which was my main motivation for visiting this museum, but I was very happy to discover a retrospective of his life that lead to his role as Prime Minister, as well as his post-war life. The ability to experience the War Rooms nearly as they would have been during the war was really very cool! However, be prepared to get caught up in the central room containing the Churchill Museum as there is so much to see. I ran out of time and barely had enough time to purchase my obligatory magnet in the gift shop!"
Do not miss,"One of the coolest things I did while in London. This is a first trip must do. A few tips for visiting: 1-Buy your ticket online in advance. The lines for buying in person is a very long wait in comparison. You'll have a particular time slot on your ticket--don't get there earlier than it says because they won't let you in line until then. 2-The lines to get in are outdoors so dress warm if it's cold out. Once we were let in we were led through to get our free audio guides and begin the self guided tour. The war rooms were found in the 1980's, almost exactly as they were left after the war. I felt transported through history and had chills many times while visiting these historic rooms. It is pretty amazing to see everything in close to it's original state. In addition to the rooms there is a very informative Churchill museum to visit in the space. I learned so much while here and felt like it was one of the most memorable stops I visited during my first trip to London. Don't miss it if you love history."
So much to see,"Try and get priority entry because the lines are really long and they stagger the entry. Even with priority you are staggered but you have a separate line that they take you in before the rest. The museum was very informative, entry includes audio guides that provide more information than the signs on the display. A very educational and interesting museum."
You must go,"Missed this on my last trip (line up) but went this time. This is a fantastic museum, great history, great information and well worth it."
Long waited visit,I think we were there three hours something. Tours is starting with infowalls and we looked at those with full attention. It is amazing how people can work and survive with so minimalistic places. We should have respect of all those!
Extremely interesting,This is not the cheapest place to go to but well worth the money. Very interesting and lots to see and read. We spent two hours browsing around. I certainly knew more than I ever did about Winston.
Very interesting museum,This is a must visit for anyone interested in WW2 and in history in general. It was interesting to see the actual conditions and the place where the critical decisions were made to save humanity from the Nazis.
Great for history buffs,"A fantastic walking tour through the former war rooms.  The Churchill museum is also chock full of memorabilia and information.  Be prepared, it is an underground bunker.  If you're claustrophobic it can get cramped at times.  Not sure younger kids will find this all that exciting.  However, the tour is laid out quite well and there is audio guide that is included."
Give yourself plenty of time - not just an hour!!,"Great museum divided into to parts: Winston Churchill's life and the war rooms. I did not realize until I took the time how fascinating of a man and how accomplished he was. You learn a lot from the museum and it is late it in a best, yet unorthodox manner which strengthens the message. You get an audio guide for the tour which is robust and helpful. The exhibits have loads of cool memorabilia from both Churchill's life, like sits, cigars, medals, etc., And from the war such as propaganda posters from Germany and military weapons. I spent 4.5 hours and was still rushed at the end, though I suspect the average person will not read every plack like I did. Highly recommend. Cafe at the museum is actually quite tasty for a museum cafe."
Even Caitlyn Jenner enjoyed it,Yep Caitlyn was here when we were and she seemed to enjoy it. We loved learning about the history of the war rooms and seeing the bedrooms was interesting. Highly recommend and then take a stroll around St James Park across the way for cherry blossom season.
Informative museum,I was here on last Sunday. They did a wonderful job of making you feel that you are there when Churchill was doing all his planning. The exhibits were great and walking through all the rooms and hearing all the information was truly magnificent. A lot of background on Churchill that I didn’t really know about. Do not miss this when you are in London
Brilliant,"I love the Churchill War Rooms, it's a place like no other, a proper time machine that takes you back to the 1940's and the war. I've been a couple of times already as I can get in for free because I work in a museum and have taken friends and family there. It's just the most amazing of places and I would definitely recommend visiting. Look out for the Map Room at the end, it's simply incredible!"
Real WW2 atmosphere,"I've wanted to visit this museum the last few times I was in London, but never had the time. I think it's a little expensive for entry (£23) and would not have like to pay for someone not interested in this kind of ""living History"" place. but if you are at all interested in the last WW this is a must for you.Churchill is of course best known for his association with leading the Allies for most of the WW (I presume the ""Yank"" had a lot to do with it when they joined in). But a good section of this exhibition shares Winston's life. I never knew that he was an officer in the services and that he spent a few years in Southern Africa. and that he first came to popularity by escaping as a POW. A couple of his personal pistols are on show, one being his favorite a Colt 1911. There is plenty of his other personal property, like his awards, medals and honers.The rooms are kept in a condition that truly gives you the impression they have not changed since the war (They have modified access ways etc . to accommodate the walk through, but this does not take from the experience. It is fascinating to see all the maps (Map Room) that were used in the war and in planning the eventual victory, with more than a few failures along the way. I found it fascinating that one permanent duty officer was task with planning and managing the expected German Invasion (that never came) Paranoia at its very peak....It is very easy to imagine people never seeing the light of day as they were busy in the war effort. One little anecdote was that they had ""Sun ray Lamps"" set up down there to give some level of skin colour (and the story of over doing it LOL).I was in there for at least 2 hours maybe a little more. You get a personal guide machine in your language of choice. I had a medium weight coat on me due to the day outside and would have liked to use a storage locker - but they don't have such facility (possible due to security issues??). The temperature was good below - but i had to take off my coat or I would have melted. But then in March - you could have rain one second and sun the next (which i did LOL) so plan as much as you can.In all the experience was top-notch. you got a good feel (i think) for what it was like for the war in the war rooms. the basic conditions they had (no luxury by any means there.).I've been there now so don't need to do it again, but it was well worth the trip - as long as you are interested in this type of thing (for the entry fee)."
Wonderful walk through history and the exhibit of Churchill's life was fascinating,"As history buffs, the hubs and I took the opportunity one rainy day to visit the Churchill War Rooms.  We arrived five minutes before it opened at 9:30 am and walked right in.  The tour of the facilities was very interesting; the audio guide entries were just the right length of time that I didn't feel like we were blocking the small hallways and we moved along at a good pace.  We probably would have finished in the suggested two hours, but we stumbled upon the exhibit about Churchill's life and spent a full 90  minutes there.  A little confusingly laid out (probably because of the room's dimensions), the narrative was fascinating. The curators even mention some of the controversies (Ghandi/India, Palestine/Israel), albeit in a very general way. Well worth a visit if you want to see what life during the Blitz was like for those running the war effort.  The rooms are exactly as they were including the map room, with the walls lined with charts and maps."
British heritage,Bristol heritage at its best teaches us real time how 2nd world war was fought and how historical place it is
Great collection of history,What a place!  So much to see and read about all that took place in the maze of concrete. Very nicely laid out with places to sit while you view or read. The audio guide is full of info & easy to use.  It is a tad expensive and you don’t need to buy the guide book as you receive the audio guide.
For history buffs,"If you like history this is a must stop (not particularly good for young children).  You see where Churchill lived and sent out recordings during WWII.  When the King refused to leave London, Churchill remained as well."
Fascinating & Inspiring,"This is a must-see for any history buff and admirer of the unflappable British spirit and their leader Winston Churchill when Britain stood alone against Hitler 1939-1941 before America entered the war.   The rooms themselves, the original furnishings, wartime exhibits, and video interviews of his administrative staff (as well as the adjoining Churchill museum) are both fascinating and inspiring."
Incredible Experience,"The first half of the tour is a look at Churchill's life with a lot of his personal effects on display. The second half is a detailed walk through the bunker, much of it remaining in its original (or very near it) state.Well worth a visit. If you're interested in the Churchill or this aspect of WW2, you could spend hours here. Get there when they open. It's a bunker. It gets cramped and people can be pushy, and you should try to beat the crowds."
War in London,"This was such a cool experience. Walking through the bunker, you got to see how these people lived during the war. The coolest part, in my opinion, was the map room. You got to see how the British planned out the war. You see a lot for the price. Although I didn’t take the audio tour, I would recommend doing it because it’ll clear up some questions you’ll have."
Fascinating,A really interesting glimpse into wartime London.  Lots of things to read and an audio guide too.  Great little cafe too.
History comes alive.,"Seeing is believing and touring the War Rooms left us feeling  incredulous and grateful to those that spent years working in this underground world.  The rooms are well presented and the audio tour perfect.  A great, well deserved honor to Churchill and his staff.  Highly recommend!"
Down in the bunker,"Free entry with the London Pass, it was great to see how things were back in war time.  We didn't use the audio guide as there was plenty of information available.  Interesting, informative and easy to navigate around."
Churchill War Rooms - A Must-See for History and War Fans,"Being a fan of the royal family and ""The Crown,"" it was interesting to learn more about Winston Churchill and the War Rooms. Who would have thought that below ground, was this busy ""office."" The layout of the area very much represented what the actual area looked like back in the day. We were also offered free audio but due to the coronavirus, we declined. Even without all the additional information, we still learned plenty. I highly recommend this spot to someone who is interested in history, Churchill , war, or even if you aren't."
Fascinating history,Super interesting.  Audio guide was helpful.  Did not realize it was as large as it was.  Enjoyed hearing real accounts of some individuals who worked in the war rooms.
"Very Well Presented, Interesting","Churchill's War Rooms were excellent. It was well presented, informative, interesting and presented in an entertaining and easy to follow way. Definitely worth a visit. It is a serious venue, aimed at older children and adults."
"what an moving walk into the past , a must see for every tourist","For me when i knew i would come to London it was obvious that i would visit the Churchill Warrooms , and how right it was , it was so moving walking through the underground bunkers and seeing how a war was being fought and eventually won , getting to know churchills life in different periods of time , and the end seeing his bedroom and almost feeling his presence as if it was 1944 . i wholeheartedly reccomend this moving , intrugeing museum to all tourists comming to London ."
Great for Adults and older children,"With our two younger kids we originally planned to skip the Churchill War Rooms, even though it was one of my top picks. We knew it wasn't the most kid oriented activities. However Westminster Abbey was closed for a special event so it gave us some time. This was just down the street and mid day on a Monday in March we were able to get right in. There were quite a few people doing the self guided audio tour, but we did have our chance to view each area without feeling cramped. They do have a special audio tour meant for kids that some may enjoy. Unfortunately our kids just didn't get into it as I would hope. There were many rooms to view, each with a great description. For adults or older children you could easily spend over an hour waking through. With our young children we were able to quickly view each area as we walked by and were done in less than 30 minutes. Definitely looking to come back and spend more time enjoying such a historically significant exhibit."
Phenomenal ,Great experience never knew it existed. What an exceptional gentleman.Total hero in many respects. You can get his whole story. You will understand why the queen gave him a state funeral and was so fond of him. This visit is a must do for anyone in London.
Wow!,This place was unexpectedly large and there was so much to see. It was amazing to see so much history.
Too crowded to fully enjoy,"This site contains both the war rooms and a museum dedicated to Churchill. It is easy to find, very near St. James' Park. I arrived in the late morning. There was no line but they 100% let too many people in for a location with such small rooms/ corridors. It was very difficult to find a place to stop, read the placards, or pay attention to your (free) audio guide without being in someone's way. As noted in other reviews, you can also constantly hear people's audio guides talking which is distracting and loud. The museum part was the most crowded so I did not finish walking through - simply too difficult to get near the exhibits. When I left, there was a line to get in so it seems best to go in the morning.Also keep in mind I was there in February - lowest of the low season - so I really don't want to imagine the crowds in the summer!"
Loved it.,"Loved it. I would definately reccomed it. If you have any interest World War II history or just want to see a very unique museum, this one is not to be missed!"
"Crowded, but fascinating historical location","This museum is near Westminster Station, at the corner of King Charles St and Horse Guards Rd.  If you look back to the east along King Charles, it’s the little black entrance to the right.  Once inside, you’re actually visiting two museums.  The first is a large exhibition dedicated to the life and career of Winston Churchill.  This is fairly comprehensive, with details about the many stages of his career and how it all fit into global context.  To be frank, this section was not laid out in the most efficient manner.  There were numerous bottlenecks where people clumped together, which made it difficult at times to progress through the displays.The next museum is the portion containing the actual War Rooms.  This is the underground bunker where people lived and planned out the course of World War II.  You follow a set path through the maze of rooms, listening to an audio guide along the way, and learn about life in the bunker and the operation of the war effort.  While fascinating, the corridors here tended to be narrow, and the way at times was very congested with other guests.  Also, it was difficult to linger over rooms that you really wanted to study, for there was always someone behind you waiting their turn.Despite the crowds, this is still a great museum and worth the visit.  You could easily spend three or four hours here."
Absolutely fascinating insight into Britain's WW2 operations,"I went here in May 2020 for my birthday- had wanted to go for quite a long time. You need to book a slot to suit you well in advance as understandably very popular with tourist but glad to say this did not detract too much from the experience as there is plenty of space and not too many visitors are let in at a time.The main thing to be aware of is that there is a large exhibition on Winston Churchill's life and times before you get to the Cabinet War Rooms which are really the whole point of going. Interesting as it is there is a danger of spending too0much time her.You get t the war rooms via pasages etc almost untouched by time some with original signage which adds to the authenticity of the experience. You see all aspects of what became the nerve centre of the British war effort from communications room, complete with banks of old fashioned telephones and realistic-looking figures of military personnel, secretaries etc, rest rooms, Churchill's bedroom.There is also a good bookshop.Allow at least 2 hours for a visit."
Interesting visit but room for improvement,"We came here on a Saturday, we had pre-booked tickets but strangely we walked straight in with no one checking them?! Overall, the weak points were the head sets - people walked around with theirs on full-blast, meaning all you could hear were people's headsets at different stages of the commentary. It ended up being very irritating, and I did wish that the headsets included earphones so only the person with the headset could hear them. The museum was interesting but as others have said, the layout didn't seem to follow any logical order (why not chronological?), and it was a bit of an information-overload. The main event was the war rooms, they were fascinating, but far too many people. When we got to the map room, we were constantly finding ourselves in people's way, or being annoyed by blaring headsets (as mentioned above). We thought it might be a bit quieter due to coronavirus, but alas no. However it was fascinating to see the war rooms and I'm glad I've finally managed to go. I learnt a lot about Churchill and what a divisive figure he actually was."
A Must See in London,"We have visited the Churchill War Rooms twice, the last time being March of 2018. For anyone interested in history, this stop is a must see."
Pretty good and well done.,Its well done with free audio book to take round with numbered positions so it doesn't matter what language you speak (signage is all in english) and just the right amount and length of information. Its very atmospheric and really worth a visit. The odd live guide give impromptu lectures (in english) which are quite fun.
Visit to attraction,"An excellent day out.  The museum is laid out very well.  The self guided audio took you round the museum, with an entertaining narrative.  It's not just for history buffs.Good value for money."
A must see ,"If you have any interest in WWII history or just want to see a unique museum, this one is not to be missed."
Must see,"If you want to learn about Churchill or the war this is an exceptional museum that accurately lets you step back into time to see where the war effort was run. It will amazes all agrees because it speed the pre computer and internet age. Well worth the 2 hoursNote, an Excellent audio guide is included with the ticket. You do not need to buy the guide book unless you want something to bring home."
Churchill War Rooms,Loved it! Very informative and feel like you have stepped back in time and witnessing it all happening. Would recommend a visit!

Worth doing but could be better,"This was on our ‘Must Do’ list for ages and glad we took over an hour to do it. The staff on the ‘shop floor’ were very attentive but our visit was interrupted by other staff members emerging from offices at the end of the cramped corridors and hurriedly walking past us often deep in conversation which was disconcerting. The Exhibition on Churchill’s life should also be re-thought. Although the exhibits are excellent , it’s badly set out and doesn’t work well in our view. The shop is well stocked but very expensive. For example, £8 for a chocolate cigar is certainly Churchillian in its extravagance. Nevertheless, an enjoyable hour and worthwhile."
CLOSENESS TO HISTORY,"Very atmospheric of the time, the War and of Churchill himself.  This place is on a very human scale but with much detail to examine.  Use your imagination and you can feel very close to the events."
Memorable nostalgia,Really worth a visit if you want to step back and experience our history. Exhibits are well displayed and you immediately feel part of the historical event. Allow 3 hours and go late morning to minimise overcrowding.
Excellent,"Being a huge fan of Churchill I found this fascinating and informative, I will be going back for a second visit to absorb what  I missed the first time! It looks as if all the people involved just got up and walked away at the end of the war and no one every returned again. Amazing to think all this went on under London. Anyone who is interested in Churchill should also go to Chartwell to see the less formal side of his life, together they give a complete picture!"
History ,This place is a must see and learn. Excellent customer service and staff were very friendly and helpful. Well recommended. Thank you. Linda
Re-live the history of WWII,"A small but great museum - tells you a glorified picture of England during the 40's era. Queus are very long, people flock to visit this place as Brits consider Churchill as their #1 in history. In summary, a beautiful portrait or mushy mushy picture of a Army General aka Prime Minister who is considered simply as war lord in some countries."
A trip into history ...,This was the number one spot that my grandson wanted to visit on our trip to London. It was so interesting for us all. A step back into history ...
Don't miss this musem,This museum focuses on the biggest triumph in British history. It is so great to see where the decisions that affect all of our lives today were made.
Iconic history,Fascinating piece of history with some amazing and unique artifacts.A lot of Churchill's history I wasn't familiar with and this was quite an insight.A truly iconic piece of British history that had a significant impact across the globe
Amazing piece of history,"We don't usually go to museum in our trips, however as we do love some history and after recently watching the awesome Gary Oldman on the ""darkest hour"" we thought it would be nice to visit this place, and not only it didn't fail, it was amazing.You get a glimpse to the real history of London and its leaders during WW II, the place provides a very good guided audio tour in many languages (yes, even in Hebrew) which makes it very comfortable and easy to follow the tour and the things you see. Certainly worth a visit, and next time we will also take the kids."
Great experinse,"I always love to see places where history happend, and this is one of the places. To see the rooms and the materials Churchills and his staff used was something special"
This is a must visit,"Went here with my wife and we both were just taken aback by just how much information there was to glean to understand and see relating to Churchill, the past and everything relating to the second world war, So much to see you need tpo allocate a few hours. Will have to return."
It was ok not more,We love history and go to a lot of museum. We had great expectations for this one. It's interesting and you see the conditions in which Churchill and his crew commanded the great decisions of WWII. But it's not interactive enough for my taste.
Fascinating trip to an historic time,"Hidden in the basement of one of the government buildings in Whitehall, the War Rooms are preserved just as they were during WWII.  While London was being bombed daily, Churchill and the government lead England's defense during those years.  The War Rooms are extensive and the free audioguides explain what happened here and made the period come alive.  There is also an extensive and excellent Winston Churchill Museum on site.  A wonderful way to learn about the courage and determination of the British people."
interesting visit,I pre booked for 4pm on a Friday and when we arrived there was a long queue waiting without reservations. A number of people in the queue did not get and were advised to book if they wanted to come back over the weekend when it would be busy. It closed at 6pm which gave us 2hours to look round. The audio handset worked very well and informative .The displays are very good and give a good insight into what life was like underground. There is a Churchill room at the back with a lot of information about his life and what was happening during his time. If like reading all the fine detail then 2 hours will  not be long enough.
Lots of History,We enjoyed our visit to the Churchill War Rooms.  We learned a lot about Winston Churchill and loved getting the glimpse of the actual rooms.
Lots of very interesting things to see!,This is a a great museum.  So much interesting information that I didn't know much about.  Prepare for a long visit though
Time well spent,"My recommendation is to ensure you buy a ticket so you know when you are going to get in, this is a very popular attraction to history buffs!Your tour includes a headset and I found the information very informative.  Loved reading all the information in the attached museum.I recommend about 3 hours here, but you can spend as much or as little time as you want."
learnt so much,If you like history you will love this. The exhibits were intresting and I think the audio guide is a must. It is real not a mock up. If I was going to be critical I would say there was a lot of reading in the Churchill exhibition. Saying which I didn't know he did so much in his early years in politics. The place itself was very organised and clean. I would definitely recommend this great attraction.
Fascinating place to visit for Churchill and WWII history!,Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the War Rooms today.  I would allow at least 4 hours as there is so much to see (and enjoy).  All exhibits and the audio guide were very informative and clear.  The War Rooms and Churchill museum give you such a detailed insight into the pre and post war years in Britain as well as the war itself.  The only quibble was the cafe there - extremely inflated prices to say the least so be warned!  Otherwise highly recommended!
Know your history,"Very informative. The audio helped but a real person would give additional anecdotes to enhance the experience. I recently watched the film, The Darkest Hour which gave an insight to the war rooms. Be prepared for reading a lot of detail. Swat up on your history to make the most of your visit ."
Highly recommend the Churchill War Rooms,We spent over 3 hours in the War Rooms and Museum.  It was absolutely excellent.  You can go round at your own pace and the audio guides are very good.  There is a lovely cafe where you can stop for a coffee and cake on the way round. Highly recommend visiting.
Strong museum,"I liked the museum, it’s impressive, because this is our story. I respect them for their victorious participation in such a difficult war."
"It's like someone said ""war over"" and room was left as is!","We thoroughly enjoyed visiting this museum. It was so authentic in how it was displayed and as it was the actual area of where Churchill monitored the war, it was amazing and you felt like you were there. Highly recommend!!!"
Unforgettable,"Don't miss this one. The underground bunker—offices and sleeping quarters—where Churchill and his staff worked and often lived during the Blitz is preserved as a museum, with an adjoining museum about Churchill himself. This is a marvelous and moving place. In the ""map room,"" you can see the map-covered walls with formations of pins and yarn showing the various fronts, just as they were when the room was last used. Also various meeting rooms and sleeping quarters, including Churchill's room, with a narrow bed and the desk from which he delivered his nightly BBC radio addresses to his beleaguered and valiant fellow-Londoners. Memorable and wonderful."
Do not miss take your time and relive history ,You could spend hours just in the Churchill portion of the exhibition .To tread the same routes as kings and presidents and winston  Himself  is amazing so carefully preserved for all to see a must visit for anybody
Don’t go if you’re deaf,"I’ve suffered the same problem at the Roman Baths in Bath. Apart from the museum part, there is nothing at all to tell you what you are looking at, just headsets with a commentary I can’t hear. Really disappointing."
Realy interesting: lots of details and very atmospheric,"Had a private view as part of an organised party, and some of us had done quite a lot of preparation. But I certainly wasn't prepared for the detail, nor the atmosphere.  If you're interested in WW2, or the practicalities of command, I recommend it."
Interesting,"I don't know much about Winston Churchill, so this was very interesting. It was a weird feeling knowing he walked where we were walking. You could feel the history."
Unbelievable lesson in history !,Cannot say enough good things about this museum. It is like stepping back in history to the war years of 1939 through 1945. Includes individual audio to explain each exhibit and room as you walk through the different rooms. A truly moving experience.
A Must See stop,"Visited for over two hours on my first trip to London.  If you are a fan of WWII history, you must go here.  The Winston Churchill museum (inside and included in ticket fare) is very informative and gives you a grand perspective of Churchill's place in world history.  Not to be missed."
Great history lesson!,"Normally I am not a huge fan of museums but I really enjoyed this one. Very friendly staff, informative and intuitive experience with lots to learn. Would highly recommend!"
"Underground rooms interesting, museum muddled","We really enjoyed touring the underground rooms with such history. However I felt the museum section was muddled and poorly curated. Too much stuff, which would be good for a research project, but far too much to take in for a tourist."
A must visit,A must see if you are passionate about history and more particularly interested in the Second World War.  The atmosphere of the time is very faithfully recreated.  It’s a place that still resonates with the fervor and tension that must have reigned there at the time.
Interesting few hrs,"Pre-booked this before visiting London. Arrived 20 minutes early but was allowed in. Audio guide is very good , saves you reading it all. Started off well in the museum but by the time we were nearing the end we were starting to flag a bit. Cafe in right place to refresh you, nice coffee then onwards to last part which was also very interesting. It was amazing to see how dedicated everyone was and the conditions they lived in. We were pleased to get out for the fresh air after just over 3 hrs so credit due to them all that worked there for days on end. All in all good morning visit"
Must See for History Lovers,"Admittedly, I started this tour not as a Churchill fan. He only spent 3 nights in the bunker, so in the audio tour you mostly hear stories from the secretaries who were truly secluded and navigated the war transferring calls and typing important documents. The Churchill museum painted an interesting portrait of a quick witted man who survived WWI trench warfare to become elected at the young age of 25."
Museum needs more structure,Great historical review. Felt museum needed more explanation as to route to follow. Arrived at 11 which looking at que when we came out was ideal.
Must see while in London,"If you are a history buff, this is a great place to visit while in London. You get to see first hand where Churchill worked out of during WWII. Sooooo much good history. I learned so much. The addition of the museum part of the attraction is a very nice addition, as you get the additional benefit of the details of Winston's whole life. I.e., not just the bunker side of the attraction (which is truly awesome in and of itself). A word of advice....We visited on a rainy February Sunday and there was a long line outside the entrance. I can't imagine what kind of crowd goes on a nice day or in a better season. My point is, plan to wait in line. Regardless, it is well worth it."
An enlightening experiece about the leadership in the War and the life and timnes of Winston ChirchillChurchill.,"Churchill War Rooms is in two parts.    First, a tour of the underground bunker built in 1940 where Churchill led Britain's war effort and, second, a comprehensive guide to the life and times of Winston Churchill from his birth to his death.   I spent 2 1/2 hours looking around and could have spent much more time looking at every exhibit so 2 hours is recommended at a minimum. A visit to Churchill's home at Chartwell would complete the picture."
Amazing!,"For anyone interested in WWII, this is a must-see! I read reviews ahead of time that suggested to budget 1.5 hours. There is so much to see and to learn about here, I would suggest more like a minimum of 3 hours."
Get a ticket beforehand ,Get a ticket if you can beforehand. There can be long queues to get in and longer if you don't have a ticket as you will have to queue separately in a slower queue.Interesting tour around the original war rooms Churchill used to direct the war and  be safe from the bombing. Its amazing that such a grand task was run from something so small.You can take a small bag in but you will have to wear it on your front.
Churchill,The War Rooms were a good peek into an interesting person. Churchill was meant to help get us through WW2. The tour gave us a good feel for what things were like during the war.
Interesting and informative,"This is a nice museum that shows a different side of  WWII.  The war rooms were interesting but the best part was the newer Churchill Museum that chronicles Churchill's life both before and after the way.  Go early in the day though since it does get crowded making it difficult to view the exhibits--especially in the war rooms.  Also, despite having pre-bought our tickets to be able to skip the line we were still funneled into the regular admission line to have our tickets scanned."
We visited the war rooms,There were long ques and we did not pre-book its was in the late afternoon and the attraction closed early soon we did not get to see everything It was nice to see history as it was during the WW2
Not to be Missed,"The Churchill War Rooms were amazing.  Viewing many of the artifacts, especially the map room, drew me back in time to World War II.  There were so many exhibits in the war rooms and the Churchill museum that it seemed impossible to take it all in in one visit.  The multi-media displays of Churchill's life added to the interest of the war rooms.  Visiting in February, it was not too crowded and I was able to take as much time as I needed.  I would classify this as a ""must see"" in London."
Excellent look into history,"Full of incredible facts and mementos of history.The audio guide is one you hold like a phone which isn’t great. But, still holds lots of information."
Good for novices and experts ,We visited on a wet Sunday afternoon along with many others. Very good visit especially with the audio guide. Lots of lovely stuff about the actual venue  but also much about Churchill. We went by train and so had 241entry which made it excellent value.
An important national treasure or huge significance worth visiting,"A very well presented and hugely educational location with massive historical significance. Well presented displays, great audio tour, great signage overall a fabulous visit. Shame it was so expensive (£20+ for adult entry but maintaining these places isn't cheap) but it was certainly worth going and an important national treasure that needs to be maintained."
History beneath our feet,"The war rooms are the most amazing things to see.  The way that the tour is run is excellent and you go around at your own pace, there is so much history that unravels as you progress around the underground rooms.  There are lots of interactive displays it really is aimed at everyone of all ages.The information on Winston Churchill is truly wonderful there is so much to see and do, my husband and I were there for nearly two hours and it was worth every minute.  There is a cafe on site which was lovely.The staff are all very friendly, there is a large gift shop and the prices are very acceptable.We had a truly wonderful time and everyone needs to visit this museum."
Great insight into history,Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting the city and interested in the history of The world wars
So much information,"We got in free with our London Pass, but it did come with the Fast Track. Our daughter needed to visit a museum for her college class, so this one was very informative. The London Pass holders did get a free audiobook. We only bought the Guidebook for our daughter."
Worth the visit ,The visit to the Churchill rooms are well worth it.That said it was very crowded even in March. I would sign up with a guide who can expedite your entrance and beat the lines
Great museum but information overload,"I really enjoyed walking through the war rooms and listening to the stories of WWII and Churchill. The rooms are set up authentically and quickly transports visitors back to the time of WWII. The audio guide is very thorough, perhaps a bit too thorough. Some of the hallways and rooms could get quite congested depending on how long the audio was for that particular area. The museum section of Churchill's life was a quite overwhelming and too much stimulation for us. There are so many different areas and lots of interactive things and the way it was organized (not chronologically) was confusing. The room was very crowded with people and just felt chaotic.I wish the Churchill museum would have been a separate ticket from the war rooms. It would allow people to choose or do both but have enough time for your brain to recover from all of the information."
Great experience,A wonderful trip through the dark times of the second World War. Have been twice now and enjoyed both times. Really interesting and well planned.
One of the finest visitor sites in London.,Wonderful visitor attraction in the heart of Whitehall. When you enter these war rooms it really takes you back to them dark days when the UK stood alone against the might of the German army. Very well laid out. Writing in areas could have been a bit larger but all in all it was excellent.
Good exhibition but over zealous and annoying staff ,"Really great exhibition with lots to see, only real let down was the staff - it closes at 6pm and at 5:20 we had 2 members of staff approach us separately to let us know that we only have 30 mins left so to make our way to the ‘map room’. On our way round we then had more members of staff saying the same thing and hurrying people along. For £23 per person it’s not exactly cheap and being treated like your on a school trip wasn’t welcome! Also, some corridors in the exhibition are quite narrow so having members of staff rushing past you often wasn’t helpful either. I must note though that once we had left the blessed ‘map room’ (so glad we saw it, wouldn’t have slept otherwise!) and reached the gift shop, the sudden hurrying along stopped, even though it was closing in 5 mins. I can only think this is simply because people were spending money!"
Excellent for history buffs,"I went here years ago and decided to go back, it does seem that it has been extended and now includes a Churchill museum. The audio guides were really useful and there is a lot to see. Allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours for your visit. We pre booked our tickets but it wasnt really necessary on the day. The cafe was nice to rest your feet on the way round. The Churchill museum I found a little confusing, but that said was very informative with lots of exhibits, well recommended"
"Great exhibition, rude & unpleasant staff.","This is an amazing exhibition & well worth the visit, but I found several staff members rude & unpleasant in their approach.DON'T TAKE A RUCKSACK WITH YOU you will be asked to carry by hand it due to the narrowness of the corridors and concerns that wearing it on your back will damage things. I asked about a locker, got told bluntly they didn't have any, carry it. I recently sustained a injury to my right hand, so I was struggling to carry the rucksack by hand. What was apparent in the war rooms is that some corridors were narrow, while some areas were open room sized. In the timeline area of Churchill's life & career, which is maybe the most open part of the museum I slipped my bag onto my back, only for a member of staff to stand in front of me and prevent me moving anywhere until I took the bag off my back. No please or thank you from him, so my son & I decided to leave that exhibit and see the rest of the museum.Of all of the IWM museums in London, this is probably the best, but if they don't want rucksacks to be carried then they should make that clear in pre visit literature and provide lockers!! Plus some customer service training for some of the staff would be very useful."
Too Expensive & Too Busy,"This is clearly used as a cash-cow for the IWM / Government.  At £23 per adult it is astoundingly overpriced.  It is probably worth about £15 at the most.  The queue was slow moving, and inside there were far too many people - to the point that it was practically impossible to actually see inside any of the rooms, or see any exhibits in the exhibition area as there were always about two rows of people in front of you.  One room we couldn’t even go into as they were preparing for some private dinner event - great when you’ve paid fully price and they still treat you like a second class citizen.  Equally, a female staff member was pushing her way back and forth through the corridors disrupting visitors even further whilst she was clearly doing some sort of ‘sales job’ to a prospective client who wanted to hire the venue.  My partner went into the woman’s loos and there was blood all over the floor that look like it had been there ages not being cleared up.  Overall, for nearly £50 for two of us, and about a 40 minute visit of not actually being able to see anything due to crowds, events and busy-body staff member, this was an absolute rip off.  I suspect they don’t care though, as people will still come just to ‘tick it off’ the tourist list."
Fascinating insight into a wartime legend,"This is a fascinating museum. Walk through, listen and learn the fascinating story of the life of Winston Churchill. Experience what it would have been like during WWII"
Queues keep you outside in the cold/wet windy weather,"We didint even get in, long queue in miserable weather, after a while we gave up before hypothermia set in."
I’m a museum and audio guide person now!,"As much as I love history, I’ve always hated audio guides and museums. However, after hearing great things from friends who had visited London, I decided to give the War Rooms a shot and I’m so happy I did. I had never used an audio guide to get around a museum before (in fact I’ve generally laughed at people who have) but now I’ll never do things another way! The tour was informative, you could go at your own pace and it was even a bit humbling to think of the many sacrifices Churchill and many others made during war time to win the war. Highly recommend this experience to anyone who loves World War 2 history! Very well done."
Fascinating,"Informative, good value for money and incite full, thoroughly recommend, visited after we had watched the Darkest Hour."
Step back into history,After seeing the film the darkest hour I wanted to see the war rooms. I liked how you could go round on your own with the audio guild which comes with no extra cost.We stopped off at the cafe and enjoyed a cup of soup. It was a bit pricey for the amount we got. We spent approximately 3hours. Well worth a visit.
Excellent,"This was our second visit to the war rooms. Even though we've been before we thoroughly enjoyed going again. The first time we went we didn't allow enough time to see everything, on this visit we there were no time limits so we got chance to look at everything, plus have a snack in the cafe bar. We'll probably leave it  a few years now but we'll defiantly go again. We got a 2 for 1 ticket online as we travelled to London by train and got a voucher off the Days Out website"
Churchills moment,This is a very comprehensive exhibit to Sir Winston Churchill and great insights into what lead him to persevere and steer the UK through very dark days caused by Hitler and his Nazi party.Great to be able to experience what conditions they operated under and how easily this might never have happened had Hallifax and Chamberlain had their misguided way.The commentary and documents are amazing that records what went on. Highly recommend booking a slot to avoid ques which are normally around 30 to 40 minutes
Fab day out,Really enjoyed this experience. Would highly recommend it. But do book ahead to avoid the long lines.
History comes to life,One of the best museums in London. Visitors get a real sense of what it must have been like to have been in the war rooms. Excellent audio commentary and a comprehensive exhibition covering Churchill’s life. We happily spent 3.5 hours there including lunch at the cafe.
War Rooms,We booked our tickets in advance using the 241 offer when travelling by train. Other half is a historian so has an avid interest. Lots to see and read inside and is incredibly interesting. Perfect to pass a few hours. Similar to Western Approaches in Liverpool. 4 out of 5 due to lack of customer service the gentlemen on the front door displayed.
Great for children,"My 10 year old son wanted to visit here and it has been sometime since I have been.This is a great place to visit and a good historical account for Churchill.  We booked online and visited at 230pm.You get an audio guide in the price of the ticket which is worth it, brings the museum to life.My 10 year old really enjoyed it."
I liked the vignettes of these rooms,"Not just having things displayed, but audio guides and full room vignettes make this tourist attraction come alive.The war was not pretty, and Winston Churchill had an unglamorous job.So having these rooms show tourists how spare and tight quarters makes the effort to fight the fascists worth every stress. It's sad to think that we don't seem to learn enough about history to avoid bringing people towards conflict. These rooms bring Churchill and his colleagues to us. To make us ruminate about whether we could ever live in such tight quarters, and rationed meals, with little creature comforts.Telecommunications and steel, concrete thick enough to protect the decision-makers of the days of yore.Incredible."
Fantastic few hours ,"Although we'd heard good things from friends and family who had visited, we were both pleasantly surprised at how quickly hours seemed to fly by in the museum. There was an excellent mix of things to read, see and listen to on the audio guide. We went in thinking we already had a fair knowledge of WW2 and Churchill himself but left having discovered more. The audio guide was great, the commentaries were very informative but shirt enough to hold your attention. It was a well organised and self guided tour with An excellent gift shop was a great end to our visit."
War Rooms,I am a history Buff and loved every minute of the Churchill War rooms. Buy the guide and it has every picture in it you will want to take while you visit. Just take the guide and enjoy. I loved this museum.
Well worth visiting whatever your age ,"What a great experience. Informative, interactive and engaging. My kids loved it as did we. We’d bought a IWM membership which is great value and gets you straight in, no queuing as we’re “Members” and so much cheaper"
Churchill War rooms,"I got off at St James underground stn , And walked 5 mins to Churchill war rooms , Head for HM Treasury ,Horse guard parade . Brought a ticket on the door , £24 per adult (Feb 2020 prices) and went straight in .Remember ! You can buy tickets cheaper on line but there is a Timed entrance procedure and when it is busy without a time in your ticket you will be given a time , So you might have to wait ! You will be given a audio guide , Use it like a phone and when you see the corresponding number on the exhibit press that number on the audio guide.There are corridors and as you proceed to the left and right of you , You will see the rooms that the staff worked ,slept , made decisions , ate and looked at data in the map room ..Saw Lady Churchill`s bedroom as well as Winstons ,Also the other Generals and advisors rooms, Not so handsome as the PM ! Some rooms have wax models inside as thou they are working there today !  Look out also as you will see the staff desks and behind them was their beds ! Some of the maps are the originals and you will see graphs on how bombing raids have done . Half way round there is a special dedicated museum to Winston , All about him ,The war , His life & death ..Excellent artifacts from Winston clothing to his own personal items ..There are a couple of short films on Winston  war duties and how he tried to solve the Middle East ..As you go round you find the space is at a premium , I was told on D-Day itself there were 500 staff members all scurrying around , And a lot of them smoked ! And as the air vent only let air out it must of been very difficult conditions to work in ? There are interactions especially in Winston museum , you will hear from some of the staff that are alive today ..The cafe was a nice break , It gets hot down there as well , Toilets are near the Gift shop ..A great place to visit , Specially when it`s raining , It is underground , It does get warm. You are stepping into history and taking a look on how the war affected everyone , from civilians to the men on the front ..The decisions that were made and who made them .."
historical Exhibit worth seeing,We visited this exhibit during a recent visit to London. We were not disappointed. The history of the War Rooms comes to life. The exhibits provide a real picture of life during the war in London. This provides a detailed review of Churchhill's life. The conufinement of quarters gives you a good idea of life during thast period.
Interesting historical museum,"A key operating center for England's strategy setting and decision making during WWII frozen in time with access to the public. The movie Darkest Hour comes to life. You can feel the confinement of the quarters, yet there was no overcrowding. The added on Churchill museum goes in depth into his life - excellent and informative. Thoroughly enjoyed for 2-3 hours"
Do not miss this exhibit!,My husband and I visited London and we are so glad we did not miss the Churchill War Rooms. It is an easy to navigate self guided audio tour that takes you back to WWII. A must see
What an experience!,We finally made it to the Churchill War Rooms and it did not disappoint.   The history of the War Rooms was brilliantly portrayed and having the audio guide was very helpful indeed.  Also we had a chat with one of the guides who was immensely knowledgeable and helpful - going into such detail was awe inspiring.
Don’t miss!  A time capsule of the past.,Gives a great feel for what was happening in London in WW2.  Fascinating and interesting! The Churchill museum is also worth your time.  Lots of Churchill’s effects.
What a wonderful history lesson...,"We spent two hours here but could easily have spent four.  Fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the man who outthought the Nazis and steered us successfully through WW2.  I hadn’t fully appreciated that Churchill was something of a lone voice during the 1930s, warning against the rise of Nazi Germany at a time when the country had no appetite for another world war and when he himself wasn’t trusted after making a number of bad decisions opposing home rule for India and supporting Edward VIII’s decision to abdicate.  It’s all there in this fabulous exhibition."
Fascinating place,Really great place to visit. Was a bit worried it may be a bit claustrophobic but it was hard to think you were underground and had no worries. The audio guide was really good and gave a lot of useful information. The Churchill museum was also very interesting. Had a really good time and would really recommend the place to visit
PIECE OF HISTORY,Being able to go and see the rooms where Churchil made that important decisions for United Kingdom was a fantastic treasure for us
Highly rude,Brilliant place for history enthusiasts unfortunately ruined by the rude obnoxious dark long haired woman on the till who was unhelpful and busy trying to flirt with the guy she was talking to than actually helping the customer in front of her. Official complaint will be submitted.
History Lesson,Great place to visit WW2 history. Lots to see and learn about how the war was won. A must see for any history buffs.
WONDERFUL INSIGHT in to the goings on in London during WW2,A TRULY VALUABLE EXPERIENCE!!! explaining the conditions that the British political and especially military leaders endured during WW2. The audio guide provided with the admission price was extremely helpful in describing your path of this underground tour.
Historical and educational place!,The husband planned our route for our 1st full day exploring the city.  This was #1 on his list.  He was not disappointed.  Amazing how they were able to preserve this place to give us a sense of how Churchill and the others lived during the war.  He literally walked the same halls where we were....and one can almost experience the fear they all felt when the bombings were ongoing. Such greatness and perseverance in a time like that.  Just unbelievable.
Churchwill War rooms,Such an interesting place to go and visit especially if you are into History and that you have done all the touristy places! Defintely recommend it!
Living history,"You will find around the UK various historic sites which are kept more or less intact, where you can immerse yourself, imagine how it used to be when action was happening.... that is what I did while visiting the Churchill War Rooms. I’ve been there a couple of times and would highly recommend a visit if you want to be on the stage of a place that you heard of or read about for your studies or leisure. Well worth the stop!"
Make sure to visit,Excellent! We spent 4 hours learning about Churchill. It was very well presented and so informative. We were lucky that it wasn't too busy so were able to get to everything easily to read and listen. Have nothing negative to report and would strongly recommend it. It would be difficult to keep young children entertained but think teenagers and above should visit to understand how much we have to thank Churchill for.
"Fantastic place, full of history and interest","One of the better places of interest to visit, they let the location, stories and artefacts speak for themselves, supported by an excellent audio guide and not too many interactive distractions! The Churchill museum is very good and better than anything Blenheim provides. We spent a thoroughly enjoyable two hours there and could have stayed longer."
Excellent experience of the important period in the past,Difficult to imagine all the important decisions made in this room change the destiny of our lives.Churchill was the great WWII hero and we owe him ore respects and gratitude!
Family day out is ideal,Had a lovely time though 90 mins with small children might be a push. Great for Churchill enthusiasts
Solo visit ,My first visit solo. 3 hours later I left gaving seen what I wanted.  Well worth taking your time on a winter visit.
Great experience - and very humbling,"Was on our 'to-do' list on a visit to London - excellent all round. Talk-along was well paced and rooms fascinating - my Grandad was an ARP warden in the war, and to see the consolidated London bombing reports that Churchill read on a daily basis brought it to life. Churchill exhibition was interesting, but a little dis-organised, and the free-form presentation did not work for me. But overall - definitely worth a visit for a one-off piece of history."
Brilliant,"The old stuff is haunting. The modern interactive stuff is awesome.  One of the best places to visit. Not just in London, but anywhere."
Neat Museum in Heart of London,"This museum is directly below the Treasury and where Churchill spent quite a bit of time during WWII. This is half museum, half historical landmark, in that you see the war rooms using an audio guide, but there is an extensive Churchill museum halfway through the tour. The whole thing took me about 2 hours, but I'm not one to linger for a long time at a museum. Worth it if you're interested in history, WWII, or Churchill."
Very good experience ,"Very interesting experience. The place is incredibly well kept. I found this museum to be very organized and i had no trouble getting around the exhibitions, thanks to the audio guide which was very informative and easy to use. Would recommend for those interested in who Churchill was and his all around legacy"
Interesting but expensive for what it is,"I visited here with my partner last week. We queued up outside for about 15 minutes before getting in, which wasn't too bad a wait considering it was a Sunday. After entry it was quite sloppy to pay for our tickets, there was no clear line and people were cutting in front of others to get in quicker! After waiting 10 minutes to be served by a gentleman, who was doing something else on the computer, we were given our audioguides and entered the first room. I found the first few rooms were way too crowded, it was difficult to get a good view into the meeting room without others pushing through and knocking us out the way! Maybe having more staff throughout would help with this and to keep things moving. The museum was interesting, I enjoyed the interactive section which seemed a good way to keep children entertained. Some of Churchill's possessions were fascinating to see, especially the letters, which was one of the highlights of the experience along with a collection of his outfits. I do feel that the museum was worded in a way that was very biased and only pointed out the good things Churchhill did, although I understand this it would have been better to have a more rounded story. The rooms themselves were amazing to see and very well explained on the audioguides, however I do wish there would have been more rooms to see as we seemed to have spent 3/4 of our time in the museum which wasn't why we visited.Overall, a very good and important piece of history but expensive for what it was."
A must for any WW2 Enthusiasts,Superb visit and will aid anyone looking to get an insight to Mr Churchill and his brilliant mind and war strategy.
Excellent tour for families.,This tour is very informative and enjoyable.  Would highly recommend for families with teenage children.  Offers a great insight into World War 2.  Well worth the effort.
Brilliantly displayed wartime experience,The Churchill War Rooms are an amazing reminder of how near we came to disaster in the Second World War. There is an excellent computer display to amuse children of all ages.
Fascinating part of British histoty,A great unknown part of British WW2 history hidden under the heart of Whitehall. Lots to see and usually very busy. Allow yourself plenty of time to see the heart of the planning of the defence of this country in a little time capsule combined with a museum.
Churchill war rooms,"Amazing you would never know they were there, so informative and really looked after well hard to believe this all went on underground, good value for money ,buy tickets before so as to miss the queues."
Amazing experience,Fantastic to see such a historic venue but also a stark reminder of the horror of war. A must see in London to understand a significant part of history.
This was one of the highlights of our trip.,T The quarters were rudimentary even for the generals and the Prime Minister.  Don't miss it.  Buy tickets online to avoid the lines.
Churchill war rooms,Amazing that just a few feet under the ground in Whitehall are these tunnels and rooms beautifully looked after and absolutely full of fascinating objects and information. I could have spent a couple of days here at least. And the guides were so helpful and knowledgeable. What a piece of history!
Visit to Churchill War rooms,"Simply brilliant. The real deal! Well organised, really informative, good value for money, and just a treat to enjoy and appreciate what happened all those years ago."
"A ""must see"" for London visitors","The Churchill Museum portion is exceedingly well done and complete. The War Rooms are basically as they were when the people left there. I could easily conjure up all the daily activities of all the occupants. The War Rooms are very centrally located, nearby many top tourist attractions.After viewing them in person, make it a point to watch some of the movies that depict the history made in this historic museum."
Excellent WW2 Historical Site,"We visited here on Jan 26, 2020.  This is a site that is included with the London Pass.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Let us just say this is an amazingly well preserved historical site.  An audio tour is included with your admission.  The tour is very well done and informative.  It was simply amazing to see how Churchill lived here while directing the war effort.  There is so much to see here, so allow yourself plenty of time. We give this attraction a hearty endorsement.  Well with the time and price to visit."
Very interesting! Worth seeing!,The tour was great when accompanied by the audio tour. Incredible to see where Churchill made history!
Very interesting historical site and museum,"As a WW2 history fan, this tour was a must. Walking through the war rooms was like stepping back in time. They did a great job restoring the rooms and making the tour informative with the audio guide.  The Churchill museum was amazing. You could spend 3-4 hours there if you wanted to see and read everything. Very well done. I highly recommend this place."
World War 2 in London,"The real underground operation center from Churchill during the War, Very clear to understand, The places, rooms and maps are authentics. There is a Churchill museum too, very interesting. Very recommended, just few meters from 10 Downing street."
"Yes, do",Another historical gem. See what went on underground!  I enjoyed the secrecy and the history of this visit.
Well worth a visit ,Amazing history.. à must see.. this place is very enteresting and we had a great timeNice exhibit. but crowded
Great place for WWII history ,So glad my coworker recommended this place.  It is a great museum that has informative audio and very cool visuals throughout!   A description of the museum does not tell the whole story.  Seeing it in person I was totally in Awe as to what they did to strategize and run the war.
Must do in London!!,"Wow! I’m a history guy so I go to all history but this museum is proof that history does not need to be boring. You are reading about the Second World War where it happened. Rich history, modern museum, great time. Warning if you did not get a ticket online, you will be waiting on a line that did not look fun. But honestly for me, well worth if I had to wait."
Fantastic..very interesting,Loved this ...very interesting and informative . We got a 2 for 1 ticket deal as we proved we had travelled by rail to London ..so it was an absolute bargain. Would definitely recommend
One of the best things to do in central London,Take a quick selfie outside the Houses of Parliament but then head off to here. This is just a great place to visit. You need to leave a lot of time to get round it. Its such an insight into the british history and the second world war from the british perspective. You do feel…
Gobsmacked..,"So much to learn and see, give yourself a minimum of 2 hours.  I have so much admiration for these brave soldiers (men AND women) now that I've been here, the museum is the BEST!  It shows what can be accomplished with brains and not computers."
Churchill War rooms. ,This is the first time I have been here. If offers a fascinating insight into this underground bunker supported by the audio tour guide which is included in the £23 entry price. Friendly staff and a great coffee shop/canteen. Absolutely brilliant. 
Need to leave more time than you think,Very interesting but be sure to leave at least three hours or you will be disappointed.  It really takes a good three hours to rush through so if you have more time be sure to allot more time to this amazing museum.
Very interesting,"Really enjoyed browsing around this museum.  Great sense of history in the various war rooms, and a fascinating exhibition about Churchill himself.  Audioguide was worth listening to.  Plenty of places to sit down as you go along, and a cafe half way round is a great idea."
Interesting!!,"Loved walking around this ‘museum’, full of history and interesting facts about Churchill and the war"
The War Rooms are great,The War Rooms and Churchill Museum are definitely worth a visit (if you sign up as a member of the IWM for a few extra pounds you get access to five sites for a year - it is worth it).The War Rooms were really well set out and interesting to see how it operated during WWII. I thought the Churchill Museum/Display really interesting but not curated particularly well - it was confusing as to which way to go so his story was all out of sequence.
Surprisingly Interesting,"I'm not really a fan of historical war items but I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. They do have an elevator in the back to get downstairs for prams and wheelchairs. Once downstairs you can get your ticket from the counter. We booked our online so it was quite easy and fast. We had an audio guide for the facility. The guide was very informative and it was easy to skip things when it got too long-winded. But for the most part, it gave enough information so you learn something without getting bored. The tour started with walking around the ground and led to the museum. The museum itself had quite a lot of things to see. A few of them interactive. You can spend as much or little time as you wanted which was nice. I really enjoyed walking around the unchanged bunker areas underground.It was quite a nice informative adventure."
a welcome back to the second world war,after visiting HMS Belfast came here for a memorable and nostalgic back in time. It is a must see attraction depicting the events of the second world war and how they live. So much history into the war rooms too much to go into detail. Just visit this attraction to see for yourself
So much information on Churchill,"Please visit this place and learn about London's iconic gentleman, Winston Churchill.  You might spend an average of 2 hours here just reading all the captions of their display.  Absolutely interesting and how nice that everything was pristinely preserved.  Take the Westminster underground exit to get here."
Very Interesting,We went early in the morning to avoid the crowd. This is a fascinating place to visit in London and well worth the money.
Over-rated. Poorly organised. Not to be recommended.,"We were so disappointed by our experience here. Admission prices set our expectations high, but this museum did not deliver. Audioguides were included, which is good, but mine stopped working after the first few listening points. There were no members of staff visible who might have been able to help. The tour has a decent beginning, but the audioguide clips I heard were too long for the natural pace of the visit. Top tip for CWR: put a lot of the ""shared memories"" as supplemental listening points. It quickly turned bizarre, as you are introduced to the WW2 setting, then jump to the establishment of the CWR, then the room which is dedicated to Winston Churchill, then back to WW2 setting. The Churchill museum room isn't in chronological order, and there is a lot of duplication across all the signs and placards. I liked the instillation where you could listen to recordings of his iconic speeches, but it got quite jarring as several speeches were played by different guests simultaneously. Our return to the war rooms was also married by auditory clashing of (I think?) BBC newsreel with the intended audioguide clip. We then got minimal view of the actual map room and Churchill's bedroom, as there were two tour groups inside those rooms. I've had better experiences where places have organised ""live tour times"" and ""audioguide times"" so that ALl visitors can enjoy their visit. I consider this museum to be completely over-rated."
history and pleasure combined,What a great visit. History and magic and atmosphere in one experience. great for adults and students. It takes the visitor right into Churchill's time. Easy visit for any age. Wonderful way to spend a wet day
Step back in time,This is a little Gem in London.Extremely Informative and enthusiastic staff. War rooms preserved brilliantly. Well worth a visit. Can get really busy so I suggest going early or later on in the day.
History of WW2,"Used in the film "" Darkest Hour"" you really do walk with Churchill and the other members of the war cabinet. See where the rescue at Dunkirk happened and of course D day itself was operated from these very rooms.They even found sugar cubes in a draw dsting back to this time. Ehere someone had hidden them hor later and forgotten them to be rediscovered years later. A unique part of Briyidh history. You see the map room the board room even down to Churchills bedroom. A must see."
A surreal snapshot of what it must have been like in 1940.,"The rooms, passage ways and contents are entirely authentic and as you wander through the corridors and rooms you get a real sense of history."
HISTORY  LIVES,Defeat  of  Nazi  would  never not  come  true without  everything  that  took  place  here. We  own  them  at  least  to  visit  and  identify  that  history  lives
"If you love WWII, great experience","So much information that I've been twice and still learned something new! Worth the time, even in the Churchill Museum."
Great Experience,"Excellent way to take a rare glimpse inside history.You will need at least 1,5 to 2 hours to see and listen everything the days that changed the course of WWII.Totally recommended for people who love history."
Fascinating,This museum was not on my list of things to see but I was given the ticket for 2 people as a gift.How wrong I was to be so dismissive of such and interesting and important piece of history at a very dark time for the world.A place to visit for everyone and not just historians.
Underground war rooms for Churchill’s planning of WWII,"Very interesting, and a very good audio guide where you can add further related subjects to the basic descriptions of rooms.  Also, a museum on Churchill and his accomplishments in his lifetime.  Plan to spend a few hours!"
Churchill war rooms,"It was such a wonderful informative adventure for that period of history and you can understand the strong man Churchill more , if you are interested in history of the WWII. It is worth visiting by all means."
Absolutely go! Totally worthwhile!,"For history people, this visit was fascinating! So much history happened here and the way the tour is presented is amazing. They also take student discount (I’m a university student in the U.S.).The restaurant also had rhubarb juice which was super energizing and hydrating for mid-tour."
An extraordinary perspective on the WWII,"Go back in time. Feel and hear the atmosphere of the Second World War from Winston’s bunker below Treasury and close to Downing Street. You will see yourself in an immersion in history, particularly in the darkest hours in 1940 immortalized in the film."
Really interesting place,This is very interesting museum. It regenerate the history of WW2 and Churchill's challenges during it. There are more interesting places to explore than time. I recommend.
Very interesting,"Excellent exhibition, well worth a visit, staff all friendly and helpful.  You don't really need an audio guide if you are English.   Allow plenty of time as loads to see."
Fantastic place to visit,"On one of our regular day trips to London, we decided to visit the Churchill War Rooms in Westminster. What an experience! This is a fascinating place with so much to see and do. A great place to visit as it is so interesting and informative. Also, if you travel by train you can get a 2 for 1 offer."
Great museum for people interested in WWII,"Very cool museum that shows you just what it looked like trying to manage an entire war.  Almost seems like nothing was touched since WWII.  The attached Churchill Museum is also great, with both artifacts and lots of information about the man.  Right in the middle of all the sights in London, takes about 2 hours to get through."
very insightful and interesting!,I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and to see the places where the planning for WWII occurred
"If you are a history buff, this is for you",Great exhibit and terrific audio guide. The museum about Churchill is very well displayed and comprehensive. Everyone in our party of 6 loved this visit.
Churchill a great man and Statesman,"We wanted to go to the War rooms for sometime but it was always sold our or extremely busy. This being January not so bad. We spent over 3 hours looking at the various war rooms, exhibits and the Churchill museum. Absolutely a must see."
Glad we went,"My husband had been wanting to visit the War Rooms for ages. It was our 1st trip to London in a while, so we thought we would go. I am glad we did. Very thought provoking at times when you realise the cramped conditions and the amount of people and the work that actually took place there. It is not all about Churchill.The only downside for me was the audio part of the tour. They give you portable audio sets, like mobile phones, because of this you have to put up with the tinny noise from other peoples sets, headphones would have been better. However I prefer to read my way around an exhibition/museum, and there were very few reading descriptions.If you are thinking of going and you are also thinking of seeing HMS Belfast, then join the IWM ... you will save over £20 per couple... and you can also go to Duxford for free."
Exceptional!,"I recently visited the Churchill War Rooms with my family of 5 (including kids aged 17, 14, & 11). It was our unanimous favorite and I can't recommend it enough.I waited too long to buy timed entry tickets, so I bought a membership which I don't regret as it gave us flexibility. We were able to enter as soon as it opened and didn't find it unbearably crowded. The Cabinet War Rooms are fascinating and we could have spent many more hours taking in all there was to see in the Churchill Museum portion. Our daughter used a wheelchair during our visit and even though the War Room corridors are not large, she found access to be more than acceptable (and in fact said that out of all the museums we visited, it was the easiest place to get around). The staff were helpful and even offered our son (who was pushing his sister) earphones for his audioguide."
Visit to London’s heritage,"Fascinating particularly for those with an interest in  Churchill or WW2.  Go out of season or use the advance booking facility, queues are bad."
"If you're a WW2 history buff, don't miss this!","Everything you ever wanted to know about Winston Churchill and his place in history is in this museum. The rooms and furniture are all as they were when he was directing the armed forces back during the war. There is a lot of fascinating memorabilia worth seeing, as well as interesting videos."
Excellent historical experience.,Excellent historical experience. Audio tour is outstanding and very informative. Well run with a great flow and suspense.
Breath taking!,"I enjoyed the history of Winston Churchill, it was a nostalgic journey! Must have it on your bucket list."
Great place to view history,"The war rooms are small , so this exhibit doesn't take long.  But I think its worth it to see first hand what it was like during WWII.  Its a piece of our history.  The Churchill exhibit is a nice add on.  Lots of interactive things for the kids."
Attended when Business Event located here,"Really good to take in the operational state of such a vital wartime command post, that could be so easily operational, with all the elements remaining including key maps."
How on earth did we win the war from here,amazing insight into a time of history that is so important to the planet. In the modern age it is almost unfathomable to understand how they ran what they did with this level of information. something that i would almost say would be impossible in the modern era.
very interesting,"interesting place to see, can get very busy, a must see for any history buff especially world war 2."
Amazing experience,What a great museum!  A step back in time as you desend below ground.  It was a great way to spend a couple of hours.
Interesting,If your a history buff you will love this.   My husband did.   The price for entry is a bit steep but he felt it was worth it.
Excellent museum,Can highly recommend this museum. Allow at least a couple of hours to fully appreciate all the exhibits - there’s a lot to take in.  The Map Rooms in particular are fascinating and check out the brilliant mail delivery system. Volunteer staff are very informative and can really enhance your visit.
Mind blowingly good,"We loved this visit - informative, interesting and surprisingly good wheelchair access throughout.  Such an insight into a man and a period of history that we should all know about.  Wheelchair access is not possible from King Charles Street - only from Horse Guards Rd."
Been on the to do list ,We really don’t know why we waited so long - fascinating museum and extensive area on Churchill himself. Great audio guide included with the ticket enhances the experience. You could while away a morning or afternoon here quite easily. Very thought provoking and an important part of British history.Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend.
Lots to see and do,"Our second visit to this attaction and the investment was apparent from th emoment we entered, the exhibits have been extended and the interactive screens were great to browse.Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot to see and read and check National Rail days out for offers in advance if you're using public transport to visit London."
Family visit,One of the bucket list items. Full of history and understanding of the times. Well curated details and very atmospheric.
"If you’re a history buff, this is for you!","If you are a big fan of history and especially Winston Churchill, this place will mesmerize you for sure! The museum is very atmospheric and there is a lot to go through. A lot of the items are actual pieces from the life of Churchill. There is a lot of video and audio content. You can probably spend 2 or more hours exploring the various rooms. Worth a visit if WW2 or history is your thing."
Churchill War Rooms - must see!,Excellent museum. Take the time to see it.  War Rooms and Churchill Museum.  Easy to get to.  It’s a short distance from Trafalgar Square.  I really enjoyed the Churchill Museum.
Many stops walking through the site,"I think that younger patrons will find the exhibits more interesting than someone who was born before or during WWII.  For us boomers or older, the items in the rooms are items that we grew up with.  Each stops descriptions are informative and give good details on what is being viewed."
A slice of history.,CWR are a great piece of history and tell a great story. The tour is self guided with handset/headphones and you can take your time. Kids get a more interactive tour on the handset and it can be completed at your own pace.
Well worth a visit,Very informative and fascinating insight into Churchill’s war years. The guide suggests 90 mins for a visit but I could have easily spent 3 hours to take everything in. Great value on the 2-4-1 offer.
Amazing WW2 Tactical Manoeuvre Museum  ,"Such a great insight to one of history’s most historical war figure head, Winston Churchill!Clearly a genius and dedicated statesman with a great brain for what’s needed during the war against Hitler!The museum was much more extensive than we had anticipated with a generous insight into Winston Churchill’s young life and progression into politics. We had spent almost 3 hours and yet it could take up to 5 hours if one were to really read through most of the exhibits! Highly recommended for history buffs like us."
Must see place in London,"Amazing to see the bunkers, restored to the original design. Extremely interesting place to learn about World War ll."
Great History,First time we visited and a must for WWII history buffs. We learned so much and the way everything was presented was excellent. Plan on spending 2-3 hours. Buy timed tickets before on line to avoid crowds. Small cafeteria with good sandwiches.
A must see,I have been to London before but never took the time to visit this historical site. I am glad I did now with my two young kids. Highly recommended but rather pricey. Bought also some Churchill memorabilia from the museum shop.
A nice place to learn about Churchill and WWII.,The CWR do a nice job on telling the story of Churchill and his cabinet and what London was going through during the Blitz. Make sure you have a fair amount of time to explore because the Churchill exhibit at the end took me longer to go through than I anticipated. So much to learn! Worth a visit and a repeat visit.
Fascinating Churchill War rooms.,This is a must see while in London. Small admittance fee to see where Churchill  and many others lived in a bunker during the war.  Many rooms were left just as they were at the end of the war. Plan on about 1 hr- to maybe 1 1/2 hours to take the self guided audio tour.  Really interesting.
Deserves the high rating,"With 2 days in London and my 20 and 18 year old (and me) looking for maximum return on our time we chose what to do carefully. We all know a little to, what I thought was, a lot about Churchill with so much detailed in blockbuster films and series over recent years. But Churchill’s War Rooms are next level. Not gimmicky but packed full of content and experience delivered cleverly it worked for us. We needed 2 hours, and could have spent more time. Churchill? It was an honest review of his life, not glorified, and humbling."
Must do whilst in London ,"Not sure how I mist this last time whilst in London. This is a must we spent 3 hours walking around , Churchill was an interesting man and the war rooms outstanding, please do your self a favour and visit this whilst in London"
Amazing,"Expect to be here for an hour but spent 2 1/2 hours and didn’t look at everything. The Churchill museum is wonderfully curated and leaves no stone unturned on his life IMO.It’s a fascinating first hand experience of perhaps the most pivotal point in British history. If you have a fascination with history, and particularly this period you will I’m sure enjoy it. If you don’t it’s still a good experience if you are curious about the period and certainly as a signpost for younger generations to have an appreciation for.The tour is via audio guide, which whilst was comprehensive, personally I always favour a personal guide. However, I think it’s probably impractical in a place that seems to be busy."
Must see - especially for a history buff,I have read about and seen so many depictions of what these rooms were like and so many movies about World War II that it was amazing to actually see them. It is not as far down as I thought they would be and I am surprised they were never bombed considering their location. You get a good idea of what it must have been like for the men and women who worked down there. The exhibits were well done and there was a gentleman who was giving a bit of a tour and explaining some of the rooms and what was conducted down there that also helped bring the space to life. I am glad I got there and would recommend it to anyone visiting London to check out.
Never Have so Many,I have been in London many times. For some reason I have never gotten to the CWR. After years of seeing dramatizations and movies centered on this site it was interesting to be in the actual space. I found on the whole the museum well organized and does a great job of explaining what life was like in this bunker during the War.  The only thing holding me back from giving it a five rather than a four rating was the Churchill Museum. While it contained some interesting information about Churchill it struck me as less well structured than the tour of the working rooms and did not enhance the visit. People seemed to be on top of each other and there was no logical way through it without the desire to back track. That said I would visit again if the opportunity presented itself.
The man and his clan deserve so much respect,I have wanted to go here for a good few years but have never managed it. I am so pleased that I have now. This was so much more than I had ever expected. It humbles you to see how these people put their hearts and soul's into the work and long hours they put in during a time of such personal cost. Everybody should go here and please do take the time to listen and look at all the exhibits. We owe it to those that gave their all.
WWII comes alive,If you are a history buff this is the place to see.  Churhills war room and bunker below the streets of london.  Self guided tour so you can spend as much time as you want.  You can see what it was like to work there and live there during the blitz. Also a great exhibition about chruchills life..
Brilliant,"We loved this attraction. It was so interesting and laid out in a manner that it never seemed to end. There were rooms to explore everywhere. We had allocated a few hours to see this attraction, but found that we didn't want to go! There was much more to see. Our 10 year old received a child's audioguide which kept her very occupied. In fact, she was disappointed in all audio guides after this one, so it really hit the spot for her. The war rooms themselves were done out very authentically. The cafe was good and the gift shop had a lot of choices for souvenirs. Overall, I would allocate the day for this attraction, rather than the morningonly, as we did. (Granted, we are history buffs & my husband is a history teacher)."
Time Travel to the 1940's,This museum is extremely well thought out. It is more like immersive theater. i was transported to the scene of life during tge London Blitz bombing during WW2.   a must-see!
Fantastic ,"What a treat this was. Highly recommend. So much to see, read interact with. So much story about Churchill.Don't hesitate and visit the war rooms. You won't be disappointed"
KBO,"KBO: Churchill lead by sheer devotion, creative thinking, and ""kept buggering on"". Thank God. A must see."
Amazing piece of History a must,"Booked tickets on line to avoid lining up and waiting. Busy with school groups but it is a museum and pleased to see them learning about the past. Take your time through there is a lot to read, see and hear. The audio guide is a must and enhances the information and your visit. We stopped for afternoon tea in cafe, food was great but just sitting there was an experience imaging what the folks experienced during the war."
Eye opening,"Not only very intersting on how WW2 was controlled/monitored, also an oustanding exposition on Churchil (his life and times)."
"Good, but ludicrously expensive","The underground headquarters of Churchill's government and military command during WWII, located under a large building in Whitehall. This is a fascinating piece of history, and if you've ever seen the film Finest Hour parts of it will look spookily familiar. It also contains a museum dedicated to Churchill himself, which is interesting in its own right and contains lots of Churchill memorabilia, like his hat, his bow tie, and of course one of the famous cigars. Also, bizarrely, one of his tailor-made one-piece sleep suits. Churchill invented the onesie - who knew?The staff are really friendly and helpful. We were still in the museum part and a young man came in to tell us that as there was only about 40 minutes until closing we really ought to go and see the war rooms section while we still had time.My only quibble really is the price: £23 per person?! Compare that with the entrance fee for the very similar Western Approaches in Liverpool: £13.50."
Great fun,This place is steeped in history and there is so much to see down there that it's hard to take it all in one go. There is a museum area which tells the story from childhood upwards. Worth visiting
History made real,"It is truly amazing to see the history - the papers, the offices, etc - in the original setting. I've read about the setup and the years in many books but this brought it to a whole new level. I enjoyed the videos and the displays. There is so much to see that I definitely want to visit again on my next trip. You can rush through the displays but I recommend 2-4 hours to give yourself time to really absorb everything.There were so many visitors that it can feel a little overwhelming even though they do a good job of spacing the times that people enter."
