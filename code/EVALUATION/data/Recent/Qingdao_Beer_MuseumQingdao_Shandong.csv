When in Rome... ,"Everyone who comes to town does the Beer Museum. It‚Äôs just a thing. It reminded me of the Sapporo Brewery tour in Japan, just not as well done. It‚Äôs fine- just not great. You can go through quickly and still learn the basics about how the brewery came to be and how it‚Äôs developed over the years. I purchased the ticket + a 6 beer tasting (which was a great deal because it‚Äôs basically the half price with a ticket, as compared to just buying the sampler at the bar. The IPA was surprisingly good and if I was able to check a bag for my flight home, I probably would have brought some back with me."
Fun!,This museum is fun and interesting even for a non-beer drinker like me. It is very organized and everything was self-explanatory. They give you two free samples of the beer while on the tour which I couldn't even finish. The room for the experience of how a drunk person feels was quite fun. This is a very busy place with tourists doing their must-do stop here. Half price for seniors which was very nice!
"A conbination of culture ,history,and current factory.","The best beer is in this museum.Much more better any other beer i have been tasted. Qingdao beer bottle one is not good than the fresh one in Qingdao.  The museum has been  keeping the old  Germany factory which was already one hundred years ago. Drinking , learning, and making friends . Good place for enjoying."
Very informative,"If you like a good beer, this is the place to visit. If you also like seafood there are plenty of eateries very close by. The museum has a very structured approach, guiding you through the different areas. The best bit (for most) is the well chilled, raw beer taster at the end. A very good way to spend a few hours."
Great exhibition and comes with great beers! ,"Great range of exhibits showcasing the history of the establishment of Tsingtao beer.  Easy to get to via Subway Line 2 station Taidong. Get out at exit A, turn left then left again into Dengzhou Road walk 200-300m.  We went in January on a weekday and there were hardly anyone.  No queues, no crowds.  The basic entry was RMB50 pp, RMB25 for students or seniors (69-69yo, 70+ is free).  The entry fee comes with two beers (two beers applies for student entries!!)."
Iconic Qingdao attraction,We lived in Qingdao for four years and only managed to visit the museum 2 years after leaving. It's a must visit.  Busy but sensibly designed to avoid a crowded feeling.  Interesting combination of history and a working factory.  Standard adult ticket is 50RMB (80RMB will also get you a bottle of beer with a photo supplied by you). Children over 140cm are half price and under 140cm free. About two thirds of the way through the museum you will get to enjoy two glasses of draft beer and a packet of peanuts. There is a souvenir shop with plenty of interesting gifts.  A must visit.
What the Germans brought to China,"The Germans time in Qingdao was short, ca. 23 years, but they forced a lot of cultural changes (architecture being prominent) and European beer making was definitely a big one too. The museum does a nice job of presenting all of the history involved, and an equally good job of showing beer making in Qingdao from 1903 until present. All of the presentations and signage are in English and Chinese, and we had an Chinese and English speaking tour guide (cost extra), but I didn't notice if the audios were in other languages so I'd check ahead. This multi language presentation contrasts with another major Asian brewery, Sapporo, where everything was in Japanese, at least in 2017 when I was there. The beer tasting is good, but not done as an education like it was at Sapporo (how to pour, features of each beer, etc.), but you can sample ones that are not exported at least to the USA.Highly recommended must do when in Qingdao."
Must visit,Nice museum with Rich history. Don't miss the this museum if you are in Qingdao. Get to try nice beer at end of factory tour.
Beer Factory,Nice visit any pay RMB$50 for tasting 2 glasses of beer and small pack of nuts. You can choose more combo. Bring your passport for tourist.
Visit of Tsingtao Beer Museum,It was an educational trip indeed. I  learned that Qingdao was colonized by the Germans that influenced them to have Tsingtao Beer. I got to taste raw beer and compared it to draft beer. The difference was remarkable indeed. Perhaps I can visit for a much longer period time so I will get to explore the Qingdao City more.
Very Nice Tour with Very Fresh Beer at the End,"Tsing Tao (Qingdao) beer is my favorite in China.  Getting to take a tour and see all of the history of how the Germans taught them to make beer was great.  Lots to see on the guided tour, and plenty of free sampling at the end.If you are a beer drinker (or not) and visiting Qingdao, this should be a stop on your list."
"Fun souvenir bottles, plus they take Visa/MC","The museum itself is not very big so you can finish touring it in 2hrs, including getting your free drink. I had bought ticket C, which included 2 glasses of beer and 1 free souvenir bottle. I think the souvenir bottle is the highlight, lol, because you can print any photo you want. Makes great gifts for friends and family! An added bonus is that most places in Qingdao do not accept Visa or Mastercard but at the museum they accept those cards so you can save your cash for other places. The staff at the gift shop were also very helpful. I didn‚Äôt have WeChat and couldn‚Äôt directly send my photos for printing on the bottles but one staff let me AirDrop the photos to her iPhone and she helped me do the rest."
An interesting place.,"As a collector of beer from around the world, the Qingdao Beer Museum was a must see for me. We took a taxi and arrived mid morning. We had no trouble getting in with our passports and it wasn't expensive (I think I even got a seniors discount). The displays were excellent and descriptions were in English also. The entry fee also included a beer tasting with a small bag of nuts, which was great for me as my wife doesn't like beer lol so I enjoyed two. The other thing I might add is that across the street are a number of great paces to eat."
A fun place to visit when in Qingdao,This is probably the most interesting sightseeing spot in Qingdao. All the rest places I went to are kinda boring and not as beautiful as I thought. And you get 2 free beer with admission!
Beer museum,Qingdao is very beautiful city and many places there but main place in Qingdao ( Qingdao museum) so visit and enjoy
It's a MUST !!,"Whether you are a beer lover or not, it's seem to be a MUST visit while travelling to QingDao. The VIP package is absolutely worth it,  especially if you would like to tasting the 6 kind of difference brew, the souvenir come with the package is truly a limited gift to bring back home from QingDao. Visit Duration : 2hrs.  Or more if u would like to spend your happy hour drinking time in the evening at the bar restaurant."
A real Qingdao beer experience üçª,"The beer museum is definitely a place you MUST visit when in Qingdao, to take full advantage of the outing go early and possibly with a group of friends."
VIP tour is well worth it! ,"We payed 200rmb to skip the queues and do the VIP tour. The museum provided us with an English speaking tour guide who spoke very good English and was well clued up on everything we asked. The VIP package gets you the tour, 2 souvenirs and the chance to try Tsingtao‚Äôs 6 different beers in a private lounge. The museum was pretty crowded but it didn‚Äôt affect our experience. I would suggest to do this tour on a weekday and not on a public holiday or it will be crowded."
Prost!,"Germans brought brewing to Qingdao in the late 1800s. The museum celebrates that heritage with an impressive display highlighting the Chinese art of brewing. Inexpensive and enlightening, it‚Äôs a nice way to spend an hour."
Good place,Nice place to spend to get an idea of overall beer making process along with beer sample tasting. you can also buy some sample beer from here.
Qingdao beer musuem,I personally don't drink beer but I quite like my visit though it can't compare to my visit to the Guinness factory in Ireland.This visit was informative and they too offer a free beer. The souvenir shop was big and when you exist you will be in Qingdao beer street. We didn't walk the street but took a cab back to the hotel
A Simple tour,I am not a beer drinker at all. But this is a simple tour for anyone who likes a  brief introduction to the process of beer making. The steps are not easiest to navigate. The number of tourists unending. However the company true to make the explanation clear and simple. This is one of the tourist attractions in Qingdao with English explanation
A worthwhile visit,"Buy the ticket which gives some beer tasting. Well laid out. Does not explain why Tsingtao is called such when the place is Qingdao - but we found out this was due to the postal system in China being run by the French who called the place Tsingtao (using their own way of transliteration, well before Pinyin was invented). For those who like beer, a very worthwhile visit!"
Historic beer tour with beer tastings!,A visit to Tsingtao Beer Museum will not disappoint. There are a range of different priced entry tickets offering different experiences. We took a guided package with additional tastings which was well worth the entry price. A must for beer enthusiasts!!
Good experience,Happened to go on a very hot day and so the first part of the museum which had little air con and lots of people was quite uncomfortable but the second part was much better. Very unusual to see at the end every guest receives a free glass of beer which people were then giving to their children including young babies! There seems to be no drinking age in china so interesting experience
Uninspiring walk though a beer factory,"After showing my passport (!) to buy my ticket, I lined up behind a 3rd grade school group (!!) to entwr the museum. Figure kids in Qingdao must like their beer.The museum was a collection of some old machines, some clever holograms, a girl handing out barley, not sure if I was to feel, smell or eat them and ending in a gift shop. But not before the best part, cold fresh (small) glass of free beer.At the end of the tour, I still do not know why they spell the beer different from the way the city name is written. The tour did not inspire me like the Heinekin brewery tour or the Guiness tour. See if you're in the area, don't bust a gut if you can't make it, it's nothing special."
Better Than Expected,"I had been resisting the beer museum, having no desire to see it.  But when a group of friends came to town, we ended up taking everyone.  It turned out to be quite fun. The exhibit of historical brewing equipment was interesting, but the atmosphere at the rest of the facility was upscale and enjoyable, with a great restaurant, the expansive and well-stocked gift shop I have ever seen in China, and for those who like it, endless beer.It is indeed worth a visit."
Very interesting and informative tour.,Very interesting and informative tour.  Good value for entry. Lots of information int he museum part.   Tasting the beer very pleasing.  Very good.  Worth the visit.
"Entertaining, educational, and refreshing!","We happened to be in Qingdao on a Sunday, so stopped by the Beer Museum for an approx. 1-hour tour and visit.  Our Qingdao-based hosts made a reservation on our behalf, so I'm not sure of the cost of our tour.  The buildings date back to the brewery's German founders and our friendly tour guide led us through several exhibits displaying original bottle designs, production methods, bottling and canning, and welcome beer tastings were we were invited to taste the ""one-day"" and ""one-week"" beers exclusive to the brewery and surrounding establishments.  We were given earpieces so we could hear every descriptive detail from our tour guide in the sometimes crowded rooms.  The tour ended in a large tasting room with lots of beer-themed retail.  Ours host encouraged us to have our photos taken and we were later surprised with a bottle of Tsingtao with a personalized label!  Exiting the brewery there are a number of beer-inspired eateries up and down the street, with tables and chairs flowing out onto the sidewalk.  Besides driving around the beautiful coastline, and eating the local seafood, the museum was a great weekend diversion."
Unreasonable,"I was shocked when I was told I had to provide all my passport information in order to purchase an admission ticket.  I said I am happy to prove my age but I consider my passport confidential and certainly don't want it entered into their database, etc.  I was told supply the passport information or no admission.Next I asked what the 60 RMB admission included (least expensive ticket price).  They said it covered admission and two beers.  I said I have no intention of drinking two beers during the day and the person with me would pass out after drinking two beers.  I enjoy beer with dinner and after not at noon.I have been to Qingdao at least 10 times before and never got very interested in this place.  Today I decided I would check it out.Not going to happen."
Must see!,"This is a must see in Qingdao. I went with several beer lover friends and had a good time. It can be crowded and there was a line when we arrived but it moved steadily and we didn‚Äôt have to wait for too long. Additionally, you can send someone from your group off to grab some beer bags to sip on while you wait. Inside the museum you learn about Tsingtao and beer in china. It was very interesting and we enjoyed the two beers though we saw many people not finishing theirs üò±Not sure if I‚Äôd go to this museum again, but certainly enjoyed it for a one time visit."
A good half day out with one of China‚Äôs best known brands,"A visit to the Tsingtao museum - on the site of their brewery - is a must if you are in Qingdao. Probably Germany‚Äôs best known legacy to China. What impressed me was the portrayal of a very successful FMCG company (with excellent branding)  but with strong Chinese characteristics. Most of the displays are bilingual, the tour is just the right length, the beer (included in RMB ticket) is tasty and the shop/pub at the end is a cut above the usual. And it‚Äôs nice to see some up to date vessels and packing lines as well as the historical stuff."
Willy Wonka for adults,"As someone who often has Tsingtao Beer in the fridge at home I was looking forward to this visit even before leaving Australia. We were a group of four with 2 non beer drinkers and everyone had a great time.To do a full relaxed walk around takes about 2/3 hours and you will see the history of the beer from its German beginnings and some fun areas, including the drunk room and projections (hologram like) of ads and beer making simulations. The tickets we purchased included the brewery tour, some free samples and a souvenir bottle with your photo on the label. Whilst not a well known beer in Australia the sheer scale of the production is amazing (18 billion bottles a year). I cant remember the cost but there are a range of low to high ticket options, ours couldn't really be considered cheap but in my opinion were good value.  The museum is well set out and informative going back through the war years and the German connection. We also enjoyed the novelty areas including the beer fountain, drunk room and interactive displays. The shop has good souvenirs and the bar at the end is spacious, includes live entertainment and several options for the beer (and other drinks). I have since  toured the Heineken Brewery tour in Amsterdam, both were good but this one is my favorite."
Must visit if in Qingdao,When on leisure or business trip to Qingdao you must pay a visit to Qingdao beer museum. Near by there is a lot of great restaurants with great bars as well.
Brewtiful (hic) place to visit,"This is a must do if you are in Qingdao, it is located appropriately in Beer Street and incorporates the old Tsingtao beer brewery buildings.  The buildings themselves are interesting as is the garden area outside with some old displays and statues. Inside you get to see some of the old machinery used to brew beer and you get to taste and smell ingredients used to make beer.  There is an interesting holographic of a brewer testing his product and you get to taste the beer with a free beer at your first rest stop.  Continuing your tour you enter a modernistic world through a stainless steel tunnel accompanied with bubbling brewing sounds and then into the bottling and packing area where you see the cans and bottles moving along the assembly line and packaged, this in itself is interesting as its all displayed behind glass so that you have an uninterrupted view. You exit into the souvenir shop where there are some good souvenirs to purchase and then into an entertaining area where you are provided with another complimentary beer.  This area is set up like a large open pub and has a large visual display screen showing continuous scenes of Qingdao.  This is effectively the end of your tour but you can stay here longer and can purchase further beer and I believe snack food.  This is really a fun place to visit."
Tour at Qingdao Beer factory,Had great draft beer there and shopped at the souvenir store. There is also a 20min long museum which you can visit to find out how the beer is made.
Most fun thing to do in Qingdao ,"There are more beautiful spots, but this is the number one fun thing to do in Qingdao. The admission is hefty but it's worth it. You also get to two beers and a little bag of peanuts. First they will tell the history of the brand,  after which you get to see the old production methods (They are not actually brewing) and get to taste some barley. Then you get a beer and a free to walk through the current factory. At the end there is a souvenir shop and a drunken house experience, followed by another beer. You can then leave or keep on drinking and have some snacks."
Great Museum!,I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Qingdao. I thought the museum was very well put together. There is a ton of information and history about the period of German Colonization and its influence on Qingdao. You get the story about how Tsingtao beer went from a local product to a world recognized brand.I also enjoyed that they kept some of the original brewing equipment to see. It is an interesting juxtaposition to the highly automated process that is used currently.Of course you get samples as well.
Average experience,I had much higher expectation of the visit to the brewery. I felt that the presenter was more keen to get through the exhibits than to give a proper explanation. So my knowledge of beer making did not increase from what I already know. There wasn't much to see in the factory visit as it is mostly modern production lines. The only good thing about the visit was the beer tasting. The beer provided was excellent and apparently has live enzymes so it will expire in one day thus this beer cannot be bought from the shops and can only be tasted here.Also there are several Qingdao Beer Factories/Museums in the city so you can be going to one that is at a completely different place. The one I went was quite modern.
You can actually take a look at the manufacturing process,Learning the history of Tsingtao Beer and also the modern manufacturing process . The ticket including two jar of different beer and 2 little packed snacks.
More beer,The brewery is a feature of the city and traces the strong influence of the German settlement.  Tsingtao beer is famous in China and the museum is interesting to visitors.The beer samples are excellent and dining is provided over the road featuring local seafood and much more beer.
Awesome tours,"Great museum that shows the history of why Tsingdao beer is amazing.  Gives free beer to every visitor and depending on ticket you can get more.  I would recommend a VIP tour so you can get explanation to what you are seeing, and more free beer of different flavors."
Good beer,"Museum great even had Aussie beer in the museum, both XXXX (from my home town and James Boag from Tasmania).  I felt a little homesick when i saw the XXXX.  Qingdao makes a variety of beer and all are grea, including a great stout which i cannot get in Brisbanet.    If you are an English speaker  all the signs are in English but a guide for a first timer to a brewery would make sense of all the equipment etc.   Take the 20RMB all you can drink for one hour and enjoy hanging out with the friendly locals and you will have a great hour or two, it will make your day!"
Pace Yourself,"The tour was fantastic, the beer superb, the experience terrific. My wife and I had the opportunity to visit on a trip to Qingdao.  We selected a self-paced tour with beer in the middle and beer and sausage in the tasting room at the end.  We love it!  The people were awesome and we spent a little in the gift shops.  I must see if you are in Qingdao."
Good organised and well displayed museum,"When you are in Qingdao and like Tsingtao beer it is interesting to do the tour. Well organised and informative. When you pay for the tour you can have a taste of a small glass of lager. At the end is a restaurant where you can have a taste of German wurst and beer to drink. Other Chinese food is available, busy place."
Loved this tour,"very interesting history and museum lost of insight into the background behind how the beer came into production, I also go to taste the raw barley and see the production line and at the end of the tour fresh Tsingtao beer straight from the production line."
Incredible History!,"As a first time visitor from America,  I am used to the small boutique breweries, so the magnitude and history of this 100+ year old brewery was fascinating! Great self-guided tour for us...amazing displays, with all in English.  The tasting room at the end was very busy, and hard to find a seat. The pale ale is the best! ü§†"
Interesting but misses experience feeling,"A nice roundtour with a lot of insight and the possibility of tasting beer (for paying). However, there is missing some guide or sound explanation. It could be much more modern and interactive."
History,To know the history of beer visit this place. Good museum related to beer. Photo opportunity. Free beers you will get 2 per ticket. We saw the bottling process also. Must visit once.
Fascinating and great value ,"The Qingdao beer museum tells you the story of the brewery from establishment by German brewers in 1903 via the twists & turns of 20th century history (the Germans leaving, Japanese occupation, the communist era then life as a private company etc) highlighting the emphasis on quality, taste and a happy, well-motivated workforce. You see plenty of historical exhibits in the old part of the brewery and move on to the modern plant where you can see the bottling operations - and of course there‚Äôs an opportunity to taste the product, albeit in small glasses. There‚Äôs a souvenir shop, and when you‚Äôre finished you are right there in ‚Äòbeer street‚Äô with a wide selection of food & drink emporiums to finish your evening. My tour cost the equivalent of less than ¬£10 (GBP) including two glasses of beer and a packet of peanuts, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good value, tickets start at about ¬£6. Good access too for less mobile visitors except in the old brewery building (section A)"
Surprising variety of good beer!,"Being a fan of good beer, We were visiting the museum with no high expectations as we were not keen on Tsingtao's export beer. However,we were to be pleasantly surprised. The brewery tour is very good with a mixture of genuine old brewery and brewing artefacts combined with some clever modern presentations of the history of Tsingtao brewery and the brewing process. Ticket prices are reasonable and we picked a medium priced ticket, which included 3 x 300ml samples of Tsingtao beer in the brewery tap. This was perhaps the most surprising bit in that on arriving in the brewery tap at the end of the tour we were presented with these 3 samples which were 'Raw beer' (unfiltered Tsingtao lager), an IPA (India Pale Ale), and a stout all of which were excellent beers leaving us somewhat perplexed as to why Tsingtao don't export this stuff rather than their somewhat pissy lager; commercial reality presumably?Anyway, if in doubt, seek it out as it's all surprisingly good."
Interesting History of the Qingdao Beer that you will learn from the museum,We brought the RMB80.00 entrance ticket which is included 3 small glass of sampler and 1 free raw beer.  We learn quite a few thing that we didn't know before about the history and the transformation of this beer beside it was built by the German.  The actual production line is nothing much as we have been numerous brewery factory around different part of the world but it is the history that is most impressive.  Worth a trip if you are in Qingtao!
Tsingtao Brewery Museum ,I enjoyed the museum. The actual manufacturing plant was fascinating. They provided 2 free samples of beer in small glasses.The prices of the souvenirs is about double what you pay at the local shops.
Too much to Learn,Well never know that a beer mesuem has so much history and lots to learn here as date back to the German days
Best Beer Museum,"I believe this is the interesting place to visit.In China, we like to drink a few domestic brands:  Tsingtao(aka QingdaoÈùíÂ≤õ),Yanjing(Ááï‰∫¨),Xuehua(snowflakes Èõ™Ëä±), and Harbin(ÂìàÂ∞îÊª®).Tsingtao is the most popular one.You can see how Tsingtao beer is made during this trip. You will see the production line! It is amazing, also, at the end of your trip, you will get a small cup of Tsingtao to taste for free."
A nice time tasting beer ,"We went about 2pm and the line to get in was really long and we had the normal time of people trying to push in front. We selected ticket E...80rmb each and allowed the tour plus sampling of 4 beers. You also get 2 more samples for free. The drunk cabin was fun but I felt a little woozy after it üòú the gift shop is pretty basic, sadly. You end the tour in a giant bar where you can claim your samples and buy more beer if you want to. If you aren‚Äôt a fan of beer, it‚Äôs maybe not for you. The tour itself was pretty boring...but the beer was good!"
NICE PLACE. WORTH SEEING,Is a nice museum to visit. You can see all brewery and the new one. Also the history of the brewery along all its periods. The entrance include a glass of beer and a snack.
Great tour with nice tastes included,The beer museum is intersting and adds a perspective to the towns most well known industry.  English speaking guides are available for 100 rmb and worth the price.
Sightseeing with tasty beer,"We came to Qingdao beer museum.We selected ticket type E (80 RMB).It‚Äôs included 4 kinds of beer tastingA building shows history of Qingdao beer. And B building showsProcess of beer factory. During sightseeing, we enjoyed beertasting. There is special beer that can drink only here. Enjoyable museum!"
Definitely worth it,"First I must say, I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would. We took the 19 bus to the TaiDao bus stop on SangZi Road and then had to walk up half a block to the big intersection DengZhou Road turn left. Just follow that for a while (the road curves)and the brewery is on your right. We chose the ¬•60 tour and I believe it was sufficient. It includes access to the main touring buildings, a small glass of bee, and a sleeve of peanuts. I think that if you plan to eat there you should probably get a more expensive package that way you can try more types of beers. There are very helpful maps in a few languages in the Welcoming Center and getting tickets was very easy.  We did not book ahead but encountered no issues. We arrived around 4pm and the ticket said we had until 6pm (but then an employee said we really have until 8)As for the history of TsingDao you may be surprised to find quite a bit of political history intertwined so look forward to that. Also at the end of the tour are some nice interactive games (even a quiz set up like a game show for three people...so make sure you pay attention, or at least read the timeline summary which is right before the interactive section lol) the gift shop is actually reasonably priced. Bathrooms near the restaurant are clean and  tissue is provided....Woohoo! There are many restaurants across the street so you have many options for a meal."
History and educational ,More than a hundred year old history when the German started this factory.  The machine from the German is still operating today even though it‚Äôs hundred year old!  This place explains how Qingdao beer was manufactured with lots to show in the history.  They offer every visitor two glasses of Qingdao beer.  Factory is in the place where visitors could see part of the manufacturing process.  A great history and educational tour!
Worth a visit,The small free glass of beer worth the visit. This is a very famous brewery in China. Had a great time at the museum.
Excellent place for Beer Lovers,It was very exciting to go there. It was full of surprises. Beautiful place for beer lovers. Great prices & great ambiance to enjoy this. Don't miss the opportunity if you are in Qingdao.
Interesting!,"We spent 2 hours there and bought the VIP package, including an English speaking tour guide. She was knowledgeable and the visit was interesting. The package includes some gifts and 1-hour open bar (draft beer only)."
Don‚Äôt leave Qingdao without it,"How can we not visit the Tsingtao Beer Museum when in Qingdao? The tour is not only educational but comes with two glasses of beer for each tourist! Interesting to see how beer is made, and how it has transitioned from manual to automated along the years."
History of Century Old Tsingtao Brewery,"Qingdao Beer Museum (ÈùíÂ≥∂Âï§ÈÖíÂçöÁâ©È§®) is one of the highlight in Qingdao. It is located downtown and 4.3 km (2.67 mi) from the Qingdao train station by car. Qingdao Beer Museum was opened on August 15, 2003 to celebrate its 100 year anniversary. This 2nd largest brewery was built by the Germans in 1903 after Germans occupied Qingdao and began its colonial rule in 1897. The location of the museum was the original Qingdao Beer No. 1 Factory belonging to the German industrial building of 1903. This 6,000 m2 (64,583 ft2) museum introduces the history, culture, production technology of Qingdao Beer and a multi-functional area.We arrived from Tantai (ÁÖôÂè∞) via high speed train in the morning. It was totally a surprise for us when we arrived at Qingdao. It was a foggy and raining day with little visibility. We heard the honks from the harbor due to very low visibility. We checked in at the hotel next to the railroad station and brought the umbrella and raincoats with us to start our adventure. Because of the heavy fog, we decided to go to visit the indoor attraction first. We took a taxi to the museum, and there was already lots of tourist lined up for the ticket booth. We purchased the tickets with one free beer. Once we entered the site, we followed the suggested tourist route to the museum which opened in 2003 and is situated in one of the old beer breweries. The museum introduces the history of Tsingtao Brewery, the development of beer culture, the beer manufacturing process, etc. It gave us a look of history of the Qingdao Beer and its developments during the past 100+ years. It incorporates the latest technologies, letting visitors understand not only the history of Qingdao Beer but also the improvement of the brew technology. One particular spot is a collection of over 400 beers worldwide on the large display panel. After the first building, we went to the 2nd building which is the modernized beer production facility. We could see the whole production line without interrupting production. It ended with the fully automatic packing of the beers. The last stop was the included beer drinking area where we collected our beer and found a table to sit down and enjoy.The total visit time is about 2 hours. We went on a weekday but still encountered many visitors. Therefore, try not visit during the weekend or on a holiday. If you would like to have more beer, you can purchase the ticket with 2 drinks. If you have never visited any beer manufacturing facility, then you should consider including this one and enjoy its history and beer."
Beer History,"As a native girl, I think it is worthwhile to visit this museum, you can get the most comprehensive history of Qingdao beer. Drunk simulation room can give you a special experience, what' more, two cups of free beer were provided. The tour route and production line are merged together, so what you see is the most realistic production process. Tickets cost 50 yuan in the off-season and 60 yuan in the peak season.Half price for children or certified soldiers and disabled people."
Interesting,Really interesting museum with lots of information about their beer history. At the end of the exhibitions you could get raw beer and some peanuts which was really nice!
Beer history,The place provides nice history of Qingdao beer. The place is crowded since it is quite popular among tourists.

All about beer,It‚Äôs about beer. How can one go wrong. Nice tours sharing the Tsingtao beer history. Try to be aware of the weather and the amount of others at the museum when choosing your day to visit. The place is quite popular and can get crowded.Fun place with good atmosphere.
Beer museum????,"I didn‚Äôt want to go, however it was interesting and i was a guest.It is in the TsangTao factory which is considerable.If you like old machinery it is good, also to watch the highly automated bottle runs.If you have an hour to kill its ok, but ‚Äúbeen there done that‚ÄùYou get two free beers!"
Cool,"For beer lovers i do recommend to buy the expensive package as you can drink unlimited for 1 hour at bar in the museum. Ticket start at 60 rmb free small bag of nut and small glass of Tsingtao beer. It is not that big, but okay to visit."
Interesting Museum with great beer ,"Similar to the Heineken / Guinness museums in Europe. Interesting company history, and tasty beer provided as part of the ticket. Good value too. Try the drunk simulator! Was actually quite funny and more realistic than you think."
Try Tsingdao beer and enjoy the museum ,"The museum is not bad. I love the drunk  simulation room, it really fun. The museum's hilight is beer tasting."
Interesting Places to go,"I hear this place many times, and this is the fist time i visit.  Qingdao Beer is a famous Chinese beer in the world, can see how the beer produce and history of the beer are very interested."
Great experience,"This place is a great experience to see how the beer is produced, depending on the package you get, you will also have an opportunity to get free samples. If you plan on taking the VIP experience you will need to book in advance. There is tours in English for an additional fee"
History of beer,"Really cool museum where you not only get the history of Tsingtao beer, but kind of a history of beer in China as a whole. Really fun!"
Museum and Beer Drinking!,"A museum for the ages. Check out the process of how things are done making Qingdao Beer, then get a drink halfway through of ""Raw"" beer. All I can say is, ""Sweet, bring it on!""Then see the history and the modern workings of the actual brewery to the bottling process. The historical labels are also quite fascinating!Then, drink some more beer! Shop. Walk through a house which simulates being drunk. Fantastic. Fun for the whole family. Let the kids drink beer too! Whoo-hoo!"
Had so much fun!! ,Its not far from the city cemter. A short ride. The museum itself more of a factory tour. But still very enjoyable to learn about history of beekmaking in Qingdao. Had so much fun there and definitely got some amazing memories.
Tsing Tao history of beer,The brewery was founded by the Germans during their occupation of Qingdao in 1903. The self-paced tour takes a couple  of hours and it is a little better than most brewery tours. The information is simple and easy to understand. The site is being renovated (April 2018) in anticipation of the visit of President Xi. Make sure you try the unfiltered beer at the pub at the end of the tour. Lots of restaurants one ‚Äúbeer street‚Äù just outside the brewery.
Interesting history site with a German twist ,"A nice historic beer making brewery that the Germans built in the early colonial years. The Chinese have expanded it into a major brewery and its worth a visit if you are interested in brewing and German history in Qingdao. It‚Äôs about 50 rmb for a ticket which includes a small beer sample, and about 80 rmb for an english speaking guide. The tour is worthwhile and provides an insight into German/Chinese history. The brewery can be crowded with tourists but I had not issues and all went well. The sampling room can be a little overwhelming when crowded but that‚Äôs normal when one travels in China. Overall a four star experience."
Walked away tipsy :),If you want to kill an hour or two this place is decently worthy of a trip. Great experience along with the beer tasting :)
A Must-Do In Qingdao,"After living in China this attraction was that much more enticing, as Tsing Tao is practically the beer of this country! I'd recommend getting there a bit early as you'll experience a long line in the courtyard, so be prepared. The admission ticket we chose was 75¬• per person, which included entrance and a free flow of beer for an hour. The museum takes you on a tour of the process for brewing, what separates Chinese beer from others, as well as the history of the city's origins. Along with beer you can take a picture for 50¬• and slap it onto the label of a bottle of Tsing Tao for a sweet keepsake! Id recommend taking it slowly during the bottling area as well, the volume of what you see being made will blow your mind"
A Chinese version of the Heineken experience! ,"Definitely a must if you are coming to Qingdao. Along with most of what's on trip advisor's app, apart from the beer city. That's only in the summer of August...The streets near by were awesome too, I don't think it's on trip advisor's app. Check out my photos for the name of the place.This was taken like a small zone of the city, easy to get to with 1 yuan buses.I felt Qingdao hasn't hit it's peak yet, plenty of construction everywhere we went. But definitely get there early, there's bus tours and plenty of people around. You get a few ""free beers"".And some cool souvenirs! Unsure of opening times"
Built in Air raid shelters,"A nice place built in Air raid shelter. Basically German history for winery, vist if you are intrested in."
Most interesting field trip from a school,"Situated deep inside the beer street at Qingdao, we have the birth place of Tsingtao beer. The first factory opened by the Germans in this part of the world, they introduce you to the fine art of beer making, indulges you in beer tasting (amazing beers) and showcases the history of the beer right from the German days. Totally worth a visit and couple of hours of your time. Be sure to sit down in one of the cafe‚Äôs lining the beer street and try out exquisite craft beers on offer."
Awsome experience,It was an awsome experience. Since we arrived at the venue till the end. The street is filled with restuarants with a Tsingdao experience. Friendly staff and assistance from reception straight through to the bartenders. Myself and my fiance enjoyed the experience so much and there is a very nice souvenir shop.Overall a great experience and will recommend it to everyone.
Beer Museum - worth the time,"The Beer Museum has a great deal of equipment originally used at the brewery which is interesting.  It‚Äôs an easy walk through with English on all the information signs.  You walk through the working brewery, be sure to watch the bottling line.  The bar at the end of the tour was a great finish.  The staff was very helpful, the helped us get a cab.  Just an enjoyable tour."
Interesting and worth a visit,"The beer museum is worth a visit if you are a beer lover. In my opinion the museum should be free as you are really just learning about the history of Tsingtao beer, and the posters are mostly marketing fluff. Expect a lot of people. Okay for an afternoon."
Totally worth a visit,Very nice tour and price / value comparison is great. Go and book a guide they have English speaking guides for just 60CNY. The tour per person is 65CNY including one hour free flow beer
"Nice, nothing special, but nice","Make sure to use your coupons you get with the ticket. 45¬• ticket is worth it only because of the coupon you get, in case you are a beer lover :)"
"Number 1 ""Must-see"" place in Qingdao!!!","The beer museum is the symbol of the city,  you can find vary interesting facts about beer history at the museum.  You can drink unlimited beer in the bar of the brewery after you finish observation of museum part.  We bought the ticket for museum which also provides entrance to brewery pub and really enjoyed the time there we tasted all types of produced beer.  There are also souvenir shops at the pub part of the complex.  I strongly recommend to go there if you like beer and everything what associated with it!"
Found a beer I can dring,Was surprised by this visit and I wasn't expected to like it that much. Not a beer fan when I accompanied my friends but appreciate the draft beer and peanuts. Great attractions and learning games.
Alright,"I was back in Qingdao to visit family and some friends and I just decided to go to the museum. There was a promotion going on but you needed a chinese app for it. The tour introduces you history of Tsingtao Beer and you can also see the process of making beer. If you are into beer this may be a good experience for you but if you are not, it may be a bit boring. Its kinda cool that there was a collection of hundreds beer bottles. You can try different types of beer at the end of the tour."
Use your beer coupons ,"There are two beers to be redeemed with your entry ticket. The signage are not clear so make sure you redeem one at the upper floor half way thru the museum and one more at the lower floor near exit. Both Chinese and English speaking tour guides were not available when I visited, so if you need tour guide (especially English) , good to call in to check first."
Don‚Äôt drink beer but worth a visit!,"If you are beer drinker, you‚Äôll love this place. If you are not a beer drinker, you‚Äôll still love this place. It‚Äôs intersting to see how beer culture was popularized in china by the German."
A Must-go destination in QingDao !,Very educating and entertaining. Just buy ticket via APP while arriving to the Reception Hall. Much cheaper than buying over the counter. May get the hotel staff to buy using their phone APP for foreigner.
Cool museum,"Informative (also for min chinese), interactive (different computer games),Lovely ""raw"" beer!Worth a visit."
Understand and taste Qingdao beer,"A place to understand the history and process of making Qingdao beer. Currently, one of the building is temporary closed for renovation and you are only allowed to visit another building as the museum. Entrance fee of RMB 45 will includes 1 glass of original beer, 1 glass of craft beer and 1 packet of peanuts. Visit before 5pm."
Beer from the world,Qingdao Beer Museum is very nice and has beer from many places around the world. You will identify many kinds of beer.
Bottoms up - worth a visit just for the sample beer,This was a must visit place even you don't drink. It was very luck that I just turned 60 as I was classed as elderly by Chinese standard thus getting in for free and get a reduced rate for sampling the product at the end of the tour. The German know how has certainly left its legacy in Qingdao with its now world famous TsingTao beer.
Summer visit more better,"Go with my colleagues, the winter in Qingdao was a little bit cold. Visit here in summer will be better I think."
A almost required stop on a trip to Qingdao,The Qingdao beer is quite famous so a visit to the city should include a stop by the beer museum.  Nothing really special but worth a stop by.   The entrance fee includes a couple of beers at the end of the tour.
Worth a visit,"We spend a day in Tsingtao Beer Museum. This museum is the factory of Tsingtao Beer so there are lots of gigantic equipments to see. This scenic spot is suitable for everyone in different ages. There are lots of video games at the exit of the museum. Moreover, children are interested at the machines which produce beer. This museum is not just for marketing stuff so this museum is definitely worth a visit."
Interesting and educational ,"My friend and I visited the museum just because it was a beer museum but found so much more! The tour takes you through not only the history of beer but also some history of Qingdao, China. The raw beer they serve at the end of tour is fantastic!"
Fun place to vist and start a tour of Qingdao !,On a cruise and for one day in Qingdao it was a lot of fun to go with a small group of 11 to the Tsingtao Beer Museum . Great to see the history from the early German days when they learned the craft to make a good beer to the modern era . At the end of the tour we had a couple of glasses of different beers which were very good . On other stops in China we of coarse chose the Tsingtao Beer to drink ! Cheers
Mystiic,"So, the Tsingtao is the official bear of Qingdao and the biggest brand in China. This is where you drink, direct from the brew. Great beer"
Good place to visit!,We really enjoyed visiting Qingdao beer museum! There are 2 sections and then a chance to enjoy beer at the end of the tour in the cafe area! Recommend the IPA and the raw unfiltered is nice too (everyone gets a glass to try). The museum is interesting and tells the history of Qingdao and shows old photographs and examples. There is also a bunch of restaurants opposite to try different food! We took 3 children under 10 and we have a newborn. If you have a baby I would reccomend using a front pack or carrier instead of a pram as there are stairs inside the building. If you just take a pram it's not hugely difficult as long as someone can help you carry it up stairs!
Very nice museum with lots of see,"The museum is an old Qingdao Beer factory. The tour starts with an intro to the history of Qingdao beer, and the history of the beer museum building. We also got to learn about the history of beer dating back to Roman times. There was a small half pint of Qingdao beer to sample. And lastly there was a walk through of the beer packaging production where we got to see literally thousands of bottles and cans of beer being packed into boxes to be shipped out."
Great Museum,"I am first time visiting a beer museum. The history of Tsingtao beer s very well explained (in english and chinese) on posters, along with the exhibition of equipment used in old days as well as photos. They also provided us with a glass of raw beer and some peanuts."
Wonderful beer museum ,I went in with an open mind to check out this museum and am amazed with what I have seen. Definitely a place to visit when you are in Qingdao.
Great fun,"We went couple times with my friends while I lived in Qingdao.The place is quite big, educational + fun and if you get really smashed if you get the ticket with unlimited beer consumption at the end of the tour (1 hour).Heartily recommended"
Neat beer tour,"This was a neat beer tour and a must do in Qingdao. The English version of the tour seems a bit rushed as you will be passing many of the local language tours but it is still very interesting to see he evolution of the brewery. At the end of the tour there is free beer too, so that‚Äôs always a plus!"
Great day out,"Its really worth a day out at the beer museum, you see the history of beer production and then get free beer in the beer hall afterwards with peanuts supplied .The crowds are bad but they are all over China, cheap day out with beers supplied and its not far from the each which is also worth a visit"
"This place is #1 in Qingdao for a reason, but be prepared for a crowd","My wife and I visited the Beer Museum during the National Day holidays and of course the place was full to overflowing with people.  When we started I was thinking this was not going to be a positive experience, but I'm happy to say I would highly recommend the Beer Museum to you.  There are two places to visit A and B halls.  A hall is a series of exhibits about the history of the Qingdao brewery; B hall takes you through parts of the old brewery.  Most of B is historical in nature although you do walk through one small part of the modern brewery.  Happily B hall was less crowded than A and it was an interesting walk through how beer is brewed as well as the history of Qingdao including occupations by the Germans and the Japanese.  Qingdao is usually associated with Germany but in fact the Germans ran the brewery for only about 20 years before the Japanese swept in during WW1 and took the place over.  The Japanese made the popular beers Asahi, Sapporo, and Kirin here.  Now of course Qingdao is a prize-winning and  popular beer around the world of which the Chinese are rightly proud.  You have two opportunities to sample the beer in ""tasting rooms"".  When in Qingdao, this is a must-see destination."
Tsingtao Beer Museum,This killed a fun hour with a couple of free beers. The Germans set up the brewery over 100years ago. English translations of the exhibits and able to view the modern brewery in action. Worth a visit for a coupe of beers before dinner.
Packed with people,"This second visit was bad timing as the museum was packed with large Chinese bus groups. I work in brewery business and speak Chinese, so I got myself into a ""personal tour"" thus avoiding the long queues everywhere. Choose a date when there is no festival, weekend or holiday!"
A Definite Must-See!!,"What an interesting experience to learn about such a piece of history as well as trying some of the most delicious beer I have had in a long time.You buy a ticket (30rmb-90rmb depending on what package you want) then go into a series of buildings which explains how it started with German colonial occupants to present-day international company. Then you go to a tasting room where you get a small glass of raw beer with choice of snacks. After that you go to packing room then to a souvenir shop (really good and interesting items) which ended in a great beer hall where you get another small glass of beer.If you get the most expensive ticket, you get a bottle of Tsingtao beer with your choice of picture printed on the front. Yes, there are some spots where it is just pure PR for the company, but it is just a small piece of the experience and rather easy to get there..."
"Interesting, but not a highlight","Qingdao has many interesting places to visit, but unfortunately I would have to say the beer museum is not particularly intriguing - at least from my Canadian perspective.  In my opinion the museum should be free as you are really just learning about the history of Tsingtao beer, and the posters are mostly marketing fluff."
"History, Brewery tour ","Our family of five took a 6 seater china ""uber"" from Holiday Inn City centre at about 2.40 pm. Reached about 25 minutes later and paid 39.11 RMB. Senior citizens , above 60 years have some discount. Visited building A to see the history of qingdao beer and B to see the production area, with beer tasting. There is a small hall for the taste of first unfiltered beer with a packet of nuts. Did  the ""Drunken House"" walk to experience the effect, felt giddy when step into the room and need to walk near the handle bars to steady ourselves.The next area has some sale of beer related souvenirs. The tour end in a bigger hall where there are many people drinking. With proof of our tickets , we got ourselves glass of draft beer. There is a souvenir shop for additional buy near the big hall."
nice place,"close to taidong,in the old city. intresting to vist and try the fresh beer so good must to see.  only  big cautions to eat in the restaurant close the museum  usually when need to pay  give the bill in chinese and add more money"
Beer Museum,"Tshingtao has a beer museum, a whole bier street and an August beer festival.""Give us an hour and we will give you a Century.""  caption on Museum""From China to the World."" Tshingtao Brewery mottoTshingtao museum is on the premises of the 1st beer factory in China built in 1903. Built by the Germans and ran by the Germans up to 1945, it actually called the Birthplace of Beer.The museum features a centenarian Siemens motor that is still operational; it ran a stirrer up to 1996 when it was retired. Other key features a hologram of a Chief Brewer who can still do a trick by spraying visitors with a mist of  fresh Tshingtao and then there is also the Drunken House which can knock one down without as much a single sip of the golden lager or frothy dark stout."
Covered the basics.,"Admittedly, I had high hopes when i decided to visit the museum. Afterall, it is the beer that is synonymous with the Chinese identity. Alas, Building A, which supposedly tells you the history of the beer brand, is full of inkjet printed replicas of old labels and old historical pictures. There was very, very little genuine history remained of the beer brand. Very disappointed. Building B was slightly better. Large barrels for you to walk through and a little more info on the beer process and the live view of the can packaging process. There is a wall of beers around the world, and you can sample 2 kinds of beer, Yuanjiang ÂéüÊµÜ Original Brew, and Chunsheng Á∫ØÁîü Pure Brew beer. I would say for 60RMB it is kinda worth its value, but then again, I would've hoped that they offered Qingdao beer flavour ice cream. Guess they have not reached that level of sophistication yet."
"nice setting, poor museum",tells you v little about the brewing process so not one for beer lovers (although the same can be said for Tsingtao!). Interesting to see european buildings in China but not much more than that. A lot of kids in here considering it's about alcohol...
Interesting exhibition,Good for rainy days. Suitable for families with children.The exhibition is very modern and informative. It also allows for a view to the beer factory production line. Visitors can try different kinds of Qingdao beer at the museum and bring some nice gifts for friends.
Been here twice,Been here twice but still loving it. It was fun and the beer are truely good. Dont forget to get some honey coated peanut .loving it
Very good museum,People in qingdao often say that the first thing german built here is the church next was the brewery such that they could get absolved for their night of excesses.The beer museum is a must see here. It contains a lot of pictures of the old qingdao which are fascinating along with a complete factory.You can see the whole chain bottling the famous beer through a glass whole.The museum explains the whole process and even give a you a few tasters.This really one of the best attraction in qingdao.
Tour with purpose,We toured the Qingdao beer museum to learn about the history and culture of beer in this area. We were also learning about the improvements the brewery has made on its environmental and social impact. This is not to be missed. It's a bit crowded but if you like beer and want to learn a bit more about it's impact on the community this is your spot.
Yes!,"If you have visited Beer factories elsewhere, you can miss the technical stuff. However, this place is unique.  Germans occupied this area (before China was considered a nation) after the Boxer Revolution.  They were only here about 20 years in all, but decided they needed beer.  This portion of Qingdao is called Beer Museum Street.  It looks like a lot of Rathskeller ps and Beer halls. Except for the language. You self tour, signs throughout are rotten in Mandarin, German and English. You choose how many beer you want and include that in your price. We chose 2. The Tsingtao (phonetic Qingdao) produced in this brewery is the freshest for the town. Beer shipped around the world is made elsewhere, in one of four other breweries. Here and only here can you buy beer straight from the kegs.  The street vendors provide a plastic bag similar to a thicker plastic one with two handles,  from a grocery store. You fill the bag, tie it off and home you go.  Some vendors are now using a fancier bag with a screw top. It is fabulously clean, clear, satisfying beer. Goes great with the very hot/spicey cuisine of Qingdao."
A good history lesson,It is an experience visiting this beer museum as you can get to know the history on how the Germany start the brewery process in Qingdao.  You will get to drink the raw beer after the tour
Worth if you like beer,Several testing spotsInteresting historyGood peanutsQuite big museumA lot of tourists groupFunny sculptures
Interesting beer history in Qingdao,"This is a great tour.  The history of beer from the German occupation is very interesting especially seeing the modernisation of the site and being able to taste the product, however, it can be very crowded but well worth doing."
Nice history tour about Tsingtao ,"They created a very nice museum. Informations by reading, pictures, relicts changing in a good way so that's not get boring. Everybody get a free beer and if you take a higher ticket level even free refill for one hour. Once out of the museum you can enjoy best BBQ and seafood in the restaurant street. This view is most impressive in the dark."
Well worth a visit,This turned out to be quite a highlight of my trip to Qingdao. If you enjoy the beer it's well worth a visit. You see the history of the factory and get to know the beer process before being offered free beer in the bar. It also has a good gift shop. Not to be missed.
Germany brings Bier to Qingdao for China to export to the World,"A German Trading Colony required Bier so in 1904 a Brewery was constructed to produce Bier using the German Purity (method) Law. The Museum Exhibition is excellent with a bit of history (original brewing equipment in the 1904 building), modernity (bottling plant) and of course what anyone comes here for ""Bier Tasting"". At the end you also get to a pseudo Chinese/German Bar where you can continue drinking and then on exit you end up on ""Beer Street"" with loads more bars - you don't need to worry too much as it's easy to get a cab/taxi in this Street back to your hotel bar!"
Good education tour ,Get a English speaking guide and interesting history tour with free beer tasting included. One of nice surprise is at the last spot a drunk house where all have fun but good education for even kids to experience the feeling of drunk without drink beer. Outside restaurant is a good place but need to watch out for price and hygiene .
Enjoy the fascinating history of 'German' Tsingtao beer ,The history of the Qingdao resonates in the history of Tsingtao beer first bottled by the Germans in the early years of 1900. Tasting unfiltered beer in the museum and the normal beer in de beer-street near the museum with its endless number of terraces makes this visit memorable.
Australian Couple on Business,An interesting afternoon. Obviously hubby enjoyed it a bit more than I did. The historical information was quite interesting and we got to sample the beer of course so who wouldn't want a relaxing afternoon doing that. To relax in an outdoor situation and have a few beers would have been better as it was a bit claustrophobic. They could improve the souvenir shop with a larger and better range of gifts etc too. I guess it's really a must see thing to do in Qingdao but I much prefer the historical buildings and architecture and the scenery of Qingdao.
fabulous ...,"enjoyed the tour..very nformative, the fresh beer tasted very good..you should try drunken house at the end of the museum tour....."
Not as good as expected ,"Most memorable moment is in the way out, the room which let you feel the drunk! Other than that, the sort of 4D explanation of brewing is fun, but as we didn't get any tour guide for the visit, it's not so attractive as other beer factory tour."
Expensive but rightfully Qingdao's top attraction,"Tsingtao Museum had some good displays about the history of the brewery.  Another section about the beer making process had good English displays.  The third part allowed visitors to walk through their production area.  One disappointing part was the sampling hat wasn't too generous despite the 80 yuan entrance fee.  We got four small glasses (less than 200 ml).  Along with the regular draft beer, we got to sample the unfiltered, IPA, and the stout (which was the only horribly tasting one)."
So great especially when compared to the ridiculous Wine Museum,"A very reasonably priced venue (80 RMB for the tour plus 1 hour of free beer drinking - with a sausage). The museum is organized, iformative and interactive (though some exhibits were broken). The site is well maintained especially when compared to the hilariously inept and bizarre Wine Museum up the street. Nice pation to have a beer in the summer."
Don't leave Qingdao without visiting the Beer Museum ,"Our visit to the Qingdao Beer Museum is the best and most memorable to us. We visited this place with my children ( 2 teenage boys &. 1 daughter in 20s). Just the name Beer Museum, stirred the curiosity of my children , so we decided to visit it. We passed the beer street which was interesting too. But the bars and restaurants that lined the street were closed because it was daytime.The beer museum is the home of the world famous Tsingtao Beer. The brewery was started by the Germans in 1903. They have kept the old office building which is part 1 of the tour. It houses the memorabilia of the company including the old tools, machines they used. The second part of the tour is in another building. It showed us how the beer was made following the different processes. They also has a huge display of the different packaging ( bottles ) of the Tsingtao beer from the time they started the operation up to the present. At the end of the tour, we were given a glass of the raw beer and some nuts for free ! My boys enjoyed the beer ! üòä while my daughter and I enjoyed the nuts üòâaccording to my sons, the beer really taste good and the alcohol is only low as compared to the beer in our country. They also tried the drunk simulator which was really fun for them ü§£ü§£ü§£ they came out still dizzy but they enjoyed the experience of being drunk while inside the house (simulator). We bought some souvenirs before we went out of the museum. Tips: 1. To avoid paying more, opt to tour the place on your own, you can go easily even without the guide. The place is well organized and easy to go about.2. If you are a beer drinker, never miss the free beer at the end of the tour. You can also pay a little extra to have some sausages to go with your unlimited beer.3. Best time to visit is in the morning. They close at 5pm."
Cheers me dears  !,Well worth a trip down Beer a Street with its numerous bars and restaurants. Beer barrels on the pavements and locals filling up their carrier bags with the local brew. The museum is a must taking you right through from the beginning to the end of the brewing procedures and two drinks included in the price. The drunk simulator is so funny too.
Great place to visit!,"I visited the museum on my own and it was very easy to have an understanding of the company and its history.I got the ticket that included a unlimited beer for one hour and a snack, it was tasty and is worthy for the price"
Must do visit,"Of course a must do visit in Qingdao is the Tsingtao beer brewery. There are guided tours, we went on our own. It can take a couple of hours and it's well worth it. You can choose your level of ticket, i.e. A ticket with 2 beers and peanuts, i think it was ¬•60, or a ticket with unlimited beer and peanuts and a sausage for only a few yuan more! The museum takes you through the interesting history of the company through to present day. There is so much to see. At the end of the visit there is a large bar downstairs for a final drink and shop.And I almost forgot, in the small tasting bar upstairs you can pose for your own label which is placed on a beer bottle and collected downstairs- we were the only tourists doing this? It's a great gift and very nicely presented too in a box and bag all labelled as Tsingtao and only ¬•35.I would return for another visit and maybe have a sausage!Beer Street is interesting enough, you can purchase beer in a bag!"
An absolute must in Qingdao,Very nice and professional. With english explanations available. Some European Museums should take an example of how to make an attractive and modern museum. Spent 2 very interesting hours there. 2 free beers included.
China Global brand,"Walked through the old section which is now the museum and the new section that still manufactures beer in a commercial scale. The museum presented the historical information from the founding of the brewery by the Germans to to-date, a joint private and government owned enterprise. Along the way, sample of an unfiltered raw beer and a draft beer with a pack of peanuts for tasting were included in the admission ticket. A gift shop offering beer related trinkets, beer and snacks is located at the exit."
Great tour and beer,We went as a family and enjoyed not only the tour but the samples afterwards. Great descriptions in English and Chinese if the history and logistics behind making this beer.
Beer!,"Chinas beer paradise, Qingdao host the their version of Octoberfest here and the museum benefits greatly."
Informative and fun,"The museum is at the site of the main production plant of world-famous Tsingtao beer. The exhibit is divided into 2 parts: the first one is housed in the former main office building, a German-style mansion still retaining some of its old-world charm. The second one is a walk-through of the beer production process showcasing the old methods, machinery and implements, while giving a glimpse of the present-day production facilities for each step in the process along the way. The regular entrance price of 60RMB includes 2 glasses of beer (0.2l each) per person - one of raw beer and one of the finished product - and a small pack of beer nuts. A beer hall with a big merchandise shop rounds off the experience. All in all a pleasant and informative way to spend a couple of hours in Qingdao. When visiting, we were able to store our luggage at reception. However, since we left the place after 5pm (so after official visiting hours had ended), retrieving it involved quite some banging on the windows and a fair bit of persuasion to get back in..."
Extended weekend in Qingdao,If you are going tip Qingdao this is a must see place. The brewery was founded 1903 by German sellers and later driven by Japanese. Today it's for sure one of the best Chinese beer...The simple tour is 60¬• and you will get a glass of raw beer (really tasty) and one normal Tsingtao end the end of the visit.
Uniqueness of Chinese beer (mix of German &a Japan),The brewery tour is nice to do and has no need for paid tour due many signs and free audio tour.  The tour teach how everything was started and how well Germans did of setting the brewery and how did Japanese help them to be part of Qingdao's beers journey. Easiest to get ticket is online cheaper and allows one just walk in avoiding the gues. Couple of free drinks on the way and then to the beer street.
Must see in Qingdao,Actually for erveryone this is the must see in Qingdao. The biggest chinese brewery. Unfortunately from the modern production you cannot see alot. Only one short view inside. We liked the try of unfiltred beer which is free for everyone. We also tried an Ale and Stout beer. So our Entrance fee was 70RMB. If you only try the unfiltred beer you have to pay 50RMB. For sure its only a try. So the glass are just 0.2L maximum. At the end is a Beer Hall where you can drink more if you want to. Also many souvenirs are available to fair prizes. All in all a good trip for once.
Get a guided tour,"The guided tour is relatively cheap and definitely worth it. Museum trip also includes more info than traditional brewery tour, plus two small free beers!"
One of the best tours I've been on,"The Qingdao (TsingTao) brewery is a must visit in Qingdao. Established in 1903, the brewery reeks history with original buildings and examples of beers from the beginning. We used an English speaking guide (60 RMB) which greatly helped plus we took the option 3 beer styles at the end of the tour. The staff are very good and a great place to spend on a cold day - they even have a stout!"
Worth a visit,"Interesting museum of the history of Tsingtao beer, well presented and interactive, and the beer is good too."
Great fun,"The tour costs between 50-70 yuan and lasts for about half an hour, during which you can see the beer bottling plant, old machinery, the history of the brewery and taste test the beer at the end. Staff there are lovely and helpful. All in all a lovely activity to kill some time for part of your day"
You can buy special goods here.,You have to pay 50 yuan a person to enter. However it deserves to look and enjoy. You can drink a cup of fresh beer in the middle of the course. At the shop you can buy special goods focused on Qingdao beer. It's really nice.
Worth seeing,"Tsingtao beer is named for the city of Qingdao. It was started in 1903 while Germans occupied the city. It has since been in Japanese and, now, Chinese hands. Tsingtao is a world quality beer. The self-guided tour is a bit pricey at 50 RMB, but you shouldn't leave Qingdao before doing it. See some of the original equipment as well as that currently in use."
"The best part is the tasting, so don't bring the kids","The Qingdao Beer Museum is a great place for couples or older friends that are beer enthusiasts, but primarily for the tasting of fresh, unfiltered beer near the end of the tour. It really is quite good. There is quite a bit of fascinating history from the German occupation of Qingdao, but really, the tasting is the best part."
Tsingtao Beer Museum,"We took a guided tour, one of three packages to choose from. Took us around two hours to get around and see the original brewery 's interior of German heritage. The interior equipment is of original nature, the cellars and kettles of the Germans who founded the brewery in 1903. Beer tasting at the end. If you plan 2-3 hours you saw it all. The original buildings are very well maintained. Okay for an afternoon."
Great museum!,"I don't drink beer, but I really enjoyed visiting this museum. It is large and interesting with a lot to see and a lot to learn about not only the history of beer, but also Qingdao and China. Really cool experience and of course the beer drinkers enjoyed the 2 free beers."
Nice museum about Tsingtao Tao Brewery,The museum is part of the big brewing company Tsing Tao. It offers a nice insight into the company nowadays but also to the roots and history. Old machines can be seen and some tasting is possible. Guide in English is available.
If you are in Qingdao definitely drop by!,Having studied 19th and 20th century Chinese history at university it was quite interesting to actually go and see the brewery and learn more about the German influence in the city. Some of the original buildings and equipment are still intact and there are photos showing the development of the brewery which were all very interesting given that I had only read about such in books. Overall a good experience and worth the trip. Funny thing is many of the local Chinese I talked to actually wished the Germans had never left as they thought now the area would be much more wealthy like Hong Kong with the British.
A must for any lager drinker.,This factory museum was worth a trip just to appreciate how your drink gets from field to glass.A true European feel to the place with well set out readable displays translated from Chinese to English.
Beer Museum,"This is the place that worth to visit,  there have many beer exhibition from every period, it is interesting to find some souvenir edition, also can know the every aspects of it was made. i like the house of beer barrel, it is a perversion house, you can actually know what are the feeling of people who was drunk, it is so funny that when many people in this house,every one walk just like a drunkard. at the exit,there have a bar, it also worth to sit there with friend and drink Qingdao beer."
Worth a visit!,"One could easily spend at least two hours at this museum, which was the original Tsingtao beer factory founded in 1903. You could get to know every aspects of it was made, and the many Tsingtao brand stories.  Drinking Tsingtao beer at such a heritage site made the visit an even more memorable experience."
An eye-opener with tasting of the best Qingdao beer,"This place is a best combination of world-class beer factory and museum with a good Sino-German history.   While Qingdao beer is world famous, many people do not know that the best Qingdao beer is not available everywhere in China or Hong Kong.   It is available as the first glass you are given to try during a tour in this museum or as a beer product available in certain parts of the world outside China only.  Even if you do not drink or do not care to drink beer, the museum will be an eye-opener in every respect including the gardening with plants outside the buildings and the good maintenance of the 110 years' old building structure.   The wine bar on the ground floor has a small shop selling Qingdao beer products, chocolates and Qingdao beer souvenirs including bottle-openers, wooden Qingdao beer cans, Qingdao beer CD boxes, Qingdao beer peanuts ... There is also a small counter offering personalised Qingdao beer bottles."
this is better than the Heineken tour in Amsterdam,awesome 2 hours touring the museum and the old brewery. Truly enjoyed the time. worth every penny. Nice souvenirs in the gift shop.
Fascinating Museum,"There are lots to see and absorb the history of the brewery first built by the Germans and later in local management.  Very informative and interesting facts, figures and pictures including a walk through of the actual brewery."
Amazing!,"What a little gem to visit. History is one thing, but the history of this beer is amazing to understand. And a great little bar to finish off with"
Been there a couple of times with different visitors,"It's worth the visit if you want something culturally Qingdao. Beer culture is very important in Qingdao and Tsingtao beer is it's foundation. The museum has lots of history and propaganda which is entertaining. The tour lacks beer and you get two small cups for free near the end of the tour. Don't bother getting a tour guide, they don't provide any information that isn't marked on the signs in the museum. You can get a beer with a specially printed picture of you on it as a label, there are lots of cheap souvenirs to buy for friends too. The best part is the cheap unfiltered fresh beer at the brewery bar at the end of the tour. Ganbei!"
Did you know?,"For those who come for the history; keep in mind Tsingdao Beer & Qingdao Brewery are owned and operated by the Chinese Government, as a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) since 1949. Therefore, there is nothing German about the beer, except its establishment in 1903 to 1914. However, the museum plays up those years, omitting just about everything there after. The beer taste watered down and the beer hall is weak on substance. I mean; where are the German pretzels??? Frankly, a very limited 6 item menu all meant to give average Chinese a bit of a feel of a German Beer Hall. Spoke to a local taxi driver who says the area is mostly for tourist, as locals stay away. Overpricedand low on quality. That said, it is unique and gives you something to tell family and friends back home."
A must do in Qingdao!,"Loved the beer museum. Unless you're really into beer, the museum part isn't that interesting. Instead, make a bee-line to the drinking areas. First stop is a complimentary tasting of unpasteurized beer. Then comes the assembly line, which is quite mesmerizing. Afterwards, the tour ends in a large Bavarian-style beer hall with some great beers on tap and delicious sausages. Tip: get a pitcher of the Qingdao IPA and a few sausages + beer nuts. Repeat as needed.There are lots of other beer places on ""beer street"" opposite the museum, but I found their beer to be watered down. Stick with what's in the tent."
Historical and enteryeining,"It was part of the program in the  Shandong group tour.  The baby boomers in the group lived through part of the Tsingtao Beer branding metamorphosis--historically informative and nostalgic somewhat.  It also was like the pinnacle of German contribution to Qingdao, aside from the sewage and hygienic systems in place then. The tour ended with a beer treat-- really 4.5% alcohol compared to 2.5% sold on streets with plastic bags or in bottles served up by restaurants.  Their snack shop ""beer nuts""( peanuts for beer) is good.  We snatched up a few boxes to bring home, also an insulated Tsingtao Beer logo stainless steel tumbler."
I'm a history lover and enjoy Tsingtao beer,"As you saw from my subject line, I love history and Tsingtao beer, so I personally loved this place. For 60 RMB, you can get a glass of raw Tsingtao beer and a glass of draft Tsingtao. For an extra 20 RMB, you can get a sausage and the draft beer comes in a huge glass. Thankfully I went that route and got a great sample of good beer. I loved the museum itself: 1. the German architecture (exterior) 2. the vast amount of history (even written in English) 3. you can see the employees working in the plantsOverall it was very impressively laid out with a bar at the end of your journey to enjoy your beer. It's a must-do activity in Qingdao."
Nice activity to do in Qingdao,"The price of the ticket was 60 RMB and it included 2 glasses of beer, that were excellent. Not very happy with the quality of the items in the gift shop (a bit expensive and the quality can be better). However, if you are in Qingdao, its a nice way to spend 1-2 hours"
Historical tour,"Highly recommended.  We took the VIP tour, and it included an English speaking guide, a special edition Tsingtao beer, private label beer with our picture on it and... a lot of beers to drink at the end.  Great facility!"
"It's interesting, if a little dull","Lots of cool artifacts, a great history and plenty to learn, sadly presented by robotic tour guides with zero personality."
good way to spend an couple of hours,I had the pleasure of taking a tour through this museum with a local and an english speaking tour guide.It's a really interesting trip through the history of Germany's gift to this city. It was a bit crowded but an interesting and informative couple of hours. The beer tasting were also OK.
"Tsingtao Beer, get a piece of the history","Its a small idea for Tsingtao to open its door and offer the general public a peek into the making of the Beer process, as well as the history of Tsingtao Beer.   The tour starts in Building A, all about TsingTao Beer's history,  and then, onward to Building B, which shows the Beer Brewing process, and evantually,  you get a small glass of  TsingTao Beer at the end of the self guided tour. It is an interesting visit, but, a bit on the pricey side.  For Beer lovers, go during the morning or late afternoon,  so, that when you finish,  you can decide which of the sidewalk bars nearby the museum that you like to sit down and have some beer."
Nice museum with beer tasting at the end,We had a guided tour in English through the museum and at the end you get a free beer with beer nuts. Nice experience in qingdao!
Brilliant morning out in Qingdaod,"Be prepared for hordes of people, many more interested in taking selfies than the brewery itself. The three pristine clean buildings offer a first rate demonstration of the history of Tsingtao Beer, the brewery process, and the machinery past and present. A free glass of 'raw' beer for every ticket holder, and the inevitable gift shops have reasonably prices souvenirs, and are not in way tacky."
Fun...ish,"We had a good time here.  There are a lot of small exhibits, many with English translations.  Like most things in China, the relatively newly refurbished museum is already looking run-down.  Many of the little video games were very cheaply made or inoperable.  The free tastes of beer were small but nice.  The best part is the catwalk view of the assembly line from above.  It's worth the trip if you have plenty of time to spare in Qingdao."
History of Tsingdao Brewery live,Just go there and enjoy the interactive museum tour and the history of Germans in Qingdao more than 100 years ago. To be highly recommended
Interesting,Worth a visit - museum was interesting and the price was very reasonable. You get to see all aspects of the factory etc. Part of the tour you get to taste the beer or pay minimum extra and you get an hour afterwards - well worth the priceGood location - restaurants out side can be a little bit more pricey
Loved it...and I don't even drink beer!,"Excellent journey through the history of Tsingtao beer and Qingdao. Very well preserved and super well presented, mixing the old with the new. A must for all ages, but probably not suitable for anyone with mobilty challenges as there are a lot of steps, levels, confined spaces, uneven walkways etc. I don't like beer, but I really enjoyed the complimentary glass of raw beer, and I really enjoyed the malt covered peanuts. An excellent gift shop at the end of the tour capped off the visit. Great souvenir and beer paraphernalia and you can also pick up boxes of individually vacuum packed malt covered peanuts to enjoy with your beer at home. Later the same week, we went back to the same street at night and were wowed by the transformation.  The entire street has bright, neon signs a la Vegas, the restaurants all have outdoor seating and many have interesting, old time beer dispensers.  You might want to specify that you want ice cold beer as they often enjoy their beer at room temperature, which in China, can almost reach the boiling point!!!.  Qindao seafood specialities, as well as western offerings are on the menu..  Don't miss this:  walk straight to the end of the shops, toward the bridge and look for the sign that says ""World Famous Street"", turn right and find yourself amidst an exciting and colourful Night Market Bazaar.  Bargain like crazy but watch your wallet."
Ejoyable but don't hire a tour guide,"Just take your time and read the signs in English. She was rushed and kept watching her watch as if she had a time limit. I went back to building ""A"" to read and have a closer look."
Nice place,"It was really nice to know about the history of famous Tsingtao beer and its birthplace, a place worth visiting. It also provides you to see the process of making beer and has free beer to offer with the ticket. A nice place..."
Interesting 100+ year history!,"The cost of admission is 60 rmb and get's you a 0.15 L glass of raw beer and a 0.15L glass of Tsing Tao draft beer.  There is a long history with this company stretching back to 1903 when it was co-founded by the Germans.  There is a lot of english written throughout the museum so it's a good place to go and learn about the history of this important product within Qingdao.  The production line was running giving you an elevated view over the packaging of cans and bottles of beer.  Located on Qingdao beer Street, it is a place that you can spend a 2-3 hours learning about their long history.  You can buy more beer to drink in the restaurant located at the end of the tour or visit one of the many restaurants on Qingdao beer street.  Well worth the trip."
Much more history than expected,"The size and history was more than I expected. There is a lot of German history involved in not just the whole town, but the brewery itself. Not to be missed while in Qingdao, weather a beer drinker or not. Just be sure to be careful of the restaurants outside of the museum. They charge you a lot more than what it says on the menu. Better off going to another place in town if your are hungry."
Truly German Style,Very well orginized. The visit on this museum is a mix of travel to the past...when the german way of brewwas introduced in china and a nowadays beer fabrication. You will have the chance to know both sides...the historical and the actual production. In the middle of visit they offer a try of draft beer. At the end don't miss the drunk house...even you didn't dirnk so much you will fell like that... worthwile.
"Great Beer, didn't feel a huge need for a tour guide","Lots of fun! We didn't have a tour guide but we also didn't feel that we missed out. Sure there might have been different information from a quite, but I also feel that there was enough information on the singage. At the end they have a place where you can put a photo on their beer label. Makes a great souvenir /gift, I regretted not getting one"
Must visit in Qingdao,Spent several hours in the Museum. Its was quite informative and all displays had English language translations. we enjoyed the ghostly image of the Brewmaster. Along the way you get to take a free glass of in process beer. Finally at the end you end up in a large bar also searving food and get another free glass of Qingdao. You can buy further glasses or pitchers of Beer here really cheaply. Good to have a few and watch the other visitors come and go.We recommend that you do the visit in the afternoon so you dont feel guilty about drinking beer in the morning ha ha. The Qingdao Beer street where the brewery resides if fully of lively resturaunts where you can eat excellent seafood. You could do lunch there before the Brewery tour or Dinner after you are thrown out of the Brewery at closing time - I think maybe 5pm.Anyway if you come to Qingdao you have to visit here. I meant millions of Chinese people cant be wrong - correct?
Underwhelming,"This museum is worth a visit, if only because it's one of the few attractions of its kind in Qingdao, but it's a little light on education - several of the rooms/exhibits seemed like they were purely for marketing purposes (like the room filled with pictures of famous people drinking Tsingtao). That being said, it's relatively cheap and includes a couple small glasses of beer, and the gift shop has some interesting knick-knacks for sale. It's something you should definitely do if you're in town, but don't go expecting to leave particularly impressed."
Fabulous insight into Chinese history,"You're going to think I'm exaggerating, but this was by far one of my favorite attractions in China (I visited Beijing and Qingdao).  Tsingdao brewery was established by the first wave of modern colonial forces, then taken over by the second, then maintained as a powerful international export by a Communist government whose signature policy was kicking the foreigners out, and has remained up through today as a barometer for China's willingness to have contact with its former oppressors.  Frankly, it's one of the most interesting history lessons I've ever seen:  The last century of China's history through the history of one (very successful) business.  And the stuff about how beer is made is cool, too!"
great way to learn about beer and Qingdao's history,"This is a fun visit, and gives an interesting way of learning about the city's past, through the story of the beer factory.  Good exhibit on how beer is made, with walk through of a modern brewery. Plus, at the end, be sure to get the beer bottle with your picture on it!"
Great tour!,The tour is really nice and interesting! very impressing to see how this brand developped and how the beer has been produced and how the process changed. Great to try the fresh one day beer and the one week beer to compare!
It's just ok...,"China is full of some of the most magnificent attractions in the world. Unfortunately, none of them are in Qingdao.The Beer Museum is OK for what it is, and is well worth visiting if you are already in Qingdao, but that is mainly because Qingdao doesn't have too many other super amazing places to see. The Beer Museum is reasonably priced (60 RMB), includes two small glasses (1 each of draft and raw beers, respectively), and is reasonably fun, especially when combined with the nearby (very touristy, overpriced) Beer Street. I would say the museum is 50% educational, and 50% pure PR for Tsingtao. Surely there are better beer museums elsewhere in the world. But of course, it's a must-see when in Qingdao. Just don't expect to be blown away."
Kind of interesting but there are better things to do,"My review is mainly based on the fact that this is somehow rated the #1 thing to do in Qingdao on this site. It's kind of cool, but there are so many better things to do. The area is quite interesting though and there are a few things to do nearby."
Well explained History and processes,"Well presented and explained historical and processes, for an easy self tour. Can do quickly or can take time.You also see part of  the functioning current brewery. Two free raw beers and end up in  brewery bar and gift shop area. Then when finished go and enjoy Beer Street!!"
Great Way to Spend a Day!,We (family of four with two young kids) thoroughly enjoyed our morning at the Beer Museum.  There were enough interesting displays to keep the kids engaged and the process was interesting for the adults also.  It was quite busy with tour groups and the restaurant was packed (and very loud!) just before noon but then a nice lull for about an hour before the after set of tour groups started rolling in.
Awesome beer for a non-beer drinker,I love the raw beer with beer peanuts.Just don't get yourself too drunk.This is the most popular tourist destination in Qingdao.
Fun experience! Don't forget to make your own labeled beer!,"The museum shows how your beer is made. I am never a friend of beer but it's good to know the way it is produced. It's like an experience to a vineyard. Not bad. We love the idea of making our own beer. Only the label though. It costs you only 35 bucks. Very nice price for a decent souvenir to friends.They offer to ship the gifts, beer glasses and beer within China.  The entrance is 60 I think and got two beer. If you like beer, you can buy a ticket at around 180 for free flow beer in an hour time."
NiIce vist and place,This is a must if you are in Qingdao as well as the Beer Street.Both are at the same place. Museum is well done and pleasant to see.
Interesting trip through Tsingtao Beer History,"The history of the famous Tsingtao brew and modern bottling operation outlined at the Museum was informative, albeit a little old fashioned. Time for a multi-media uplift."
Shows how beer is made and gives you a small taster too,This museum gives a little about the history of the famous beer made here (and elsewhere in the district I believe) - it has an interesting German past... the tour is quite quick and leads to a tasting hall and gift shop. I have been here before (2008) and think I was more impressed then but maybe it was the weather this time.
great tour and beer,Love the tour and the beer.  Try the room which induce drunken sensation and then have a few drinks again :)
Beer!!,"This is not only an interesting insight into one of the most popular Chinese beers but also a history lesson of the growth of this company along with China itself.  A self guided tour will cost you 60 RMB and it's completely worth the price which will include two small drafts and a package of peanuts.  Once finished with the tour you have the opportunity to sit in the ""beer garden"" and consume more beers for additionally costs.  If you're looking for something to do in Qingdao I strongly recommend visiting the museum."
love it,"qingdao beer is very famous and tasty. In this museum, I learned the development of this scrumptious drink. It is a real place for beer lovers."
Love it!,"My number 1 stop for qingdao and it did not disappoint. The museum provides an interesting glimpse of the museum from its inception, detailing its German and Japanese influence. The free beer tasting at the end was refreshing and incredibly tasty, after all it was fresh from the factory!"
Love me some beer,"It was great.    They had 2 sections.  One explaining the history, and one explaining the brew process.   Half way through the second section they let you sample the unfiltered beer and at the end you can sample the finished product."
"Good Tour, Great Beer","My husband and I paid to have the tour with the English interpreter. She did a good job. Not sorry we decided to pay for that; made the tour A LOT more interesting. When you take that tour, you get A LOT more beer too. You also get a beer bottle with your picture on it. :) So in total we each got 6 beers to drink, one of them was beer on tap. Beer on tap is really hard to come by in China, so it was a REAL treat!!! The gift shop is nice. We bought a lot of fun things for ourselves, friends and family. The prices are reasonable in the gift shop. Like others have said they give you some peanuts to eat, really good too. At one point they even let you try some of the roasted barley they use to make some of the beer. Those little kernels were really good. All in all it was worth going to see. :)"
Interesting to visit,We went there in a group. We could learn history of beer culture in China. Museum provide English speaking guide.  At the end of the tour we could test TSINGTAO beer
interesting visit,it was very interesting to visit this museum and to recognize the European influence from the past. Even though with kids we enjoyed the entire tour and also the tasting.
Best money I've ever spent on a tour in China,"I've been in China over a decade and have gone on countless tours. This one absolutely was the best for the money. We bought the big-ticket VIP tour (180 RMB/person), which came with an English-speaking guide. Our guide was friendly, knowledgeable, and spoke great English. The tour took about an hour and covered everything you'd ever want to know about Qingdao beer -- history, manufacturing process, etc. At the end, we got to sample more beer than I could possibly drink. There's a very nice snack bar and gift shop right there where you come out, great to relax, have a bite, try to finish all that beer, and buy some souvenirs."
Interesting place and Tasting Qingdao beer,"The Tsingtao Beer Museum is one of attractions in Qingdao.you will see the history of the brewery and how beer was made of Qingdao beerI like Qingdao beer.I was visiting with my friends and drinking sample beer.After the tour, you can more drinking all along Beer Street just outside. If you wantEnjoy great time"
Don't leave Qingdao without visiting their beer museum,"I visited Qingdao Beer Museum with my children. This is one of the highlights of our first visit in Qingdao. Since Qingdao or ""Tsing tao"" is famous for their beer. It was a great & fun experience! Educational too. The architecture of the buildings are German - inspired since this place was founded by the Germans in 1903. We had our tour on our own and go on our own pace..the museum was divided into 2 buildings, Part A &B. It was fun and informative to read the history of the place. Some of the displays were the old equipments used , the different packaging of their beer, the Identification cards of some of their employees in the 1940's and the very first barrel used in exporting their beer and the fun part is the free glass of raw beer at the end of the tour. Although my daughter & I don't drink beer, my 2 sons ages 20&18 , enjoyed the beer & nuts for free! They said , the alcohol content in Tsingtao beer is only 3-5% , which is very mild as compared to the famous beer in the Philippines which has 17% alcohol. After drinking the free beer, we proceeded to their shops where I bought some souvenirs while my boys tried the drunken room, where they experienced being drunk and could hardly walk ! While my daughter took a video of her brothers' drunken experience. It was fun ! My children said , visiting the beer museum is one of their memorable experiences in Qingdao. When you are visiting Qingdao for the first time, don't leave the place without visiting the Beer Museum."
Very nice made,We went to see the museum and we were very delighted by the infrastructure that was made. I recommend if you go to Qingdao to see and get a fresh beer too. Nice nice
Beer Beer and More Beer !,"Fun in Qindao with Beer ! I was visiting a vendor in Qindao and we finished early so we set off to visit this beer museum - what fun! I got to see the history of this place which was quite amazing and to top it off we got to sample the beer - Quingdao raw beer is one of the best beers I ve had- and I never thought I would say that. if you have time you have to go here and take the tour it was great fun. we did the guided tour, with the unclean headsets... and it was just so so.. I would highly recommend that you just do the tour on your own, you can take more time to read the installations and move at your own pace"
Old Brewery for Tsing Tao Beer,"The tour of the brewery is OK, and is a self guided tour. Mostly pictures and models describing the beer making process and its evolution over the years. The bottling and packing production is very interesting. There is one unusual attraction that allows you to walk through a room mounted on an angle which gives you the feeling total unbalance. A small taste of the beer is included at the end of the tour, as well as a gift shop."
Historic legacy,"As with most foreign presence, they leave their mark behind none so significant as introducing beer brewing to Qingtao.  The legacy is ""Give me one minute and I will give you 100 years of legacy"".  This has hold truth to this day since 1903 and Tsingtao beer is still in production now managed by a Chinese government-owned  conglomerate.  This beer museum is tantamount to its 100 years old history.  Good to spend 1-1.5 hours in this place where you are given complimentary 2 glasses to taste at the end of the tour.  You can order German food to go with your beer!"
Leisure visit,"The admission fee to the beer museum is ard RMB50. It walks u through the history, process, types of beer etc. So unless u're a beer lover who not only loves the beer but wants to understand  the 'behind  the scene' n history if Qingdao Beer.....u can actually just go directly to the beer cafe at the side of the musuem, which also belongs  to the museum. There, u can get the 500ml drafts for RMB10! They also sell snacks n german food. Souvenirs  from the museum  are also sold here. So, save your admission  fee n just  eat n be merry  at the cafe! üòä"
The History of Tsingtao or Qingdao,"If you just happen to find yourself in Qingdao, China you may be a tourist but more likely on a business trip. A visit to the beer museum is good fun. You usually get to taste an ample amount of the German crafted and Chinese perfected brew.. And it's on Beer Street (Pijiu Lu) which is a collection of seafood restaurants where you can choose your fresh seafood from a tank..A great eating experience for those who want to be a bit more adventurous."
"Great beer, great guide, great sausage!","This is a brewery tour with an interesting museum. We had an English guide for the two of us (not expensive), and we chose the slightly more pricey larger beer and sausage included tour. Two hours or so very well spent. There cannot be many breweries that have been owned by so many different countries. With a history of over 100 years, the QingDao (Tsing Tao as we would see in UK) Brewery has many stories to tell. At the end of the tour, there is a bar / limited restaurant and very good souvenir shop. The dearer tour has a bottomless pint for up to two hours - lovely cold fresh beer! Or you can pay for other styles such as their dry and hoppy but also bitter IPA. The food is basic but very reasonable and I would recommend this tour to anyone! If you like beer so much the better."
great,"we paid for an English guide, which i am glad. she explained a lot. we also got our picture takenand put on   beer bottle for 30 RMB."
"Interesting tour, great for a beer lover or history fan","We opted for a tour with an English guide plus paid an extra 20RMB for German sausages and unlimited beer for 2 hours at the end of the tour (which is great value). The tour has two parts, first looking at the history of the Tsingdao brewery and walking around the old brewery itself which was immaculate. Secondly, going in to the modern brewery. The historical part was great, learning about the rich past of the brewery and seeing the beautiful old kettles and mash tuns. The second part was ok, we couldn't go in much of the modern brewery as it was closed for repairs and the parts we did see you were behind glass panels, which I understand might be required as a commercial business but I have not experienced this on other brewery tours. The guide was very pleasant although sometimes did try to move on you on quickly so don't be afraid to hang back and look at the things you want to. You also get to try some unfiltered fresh beer from Tsingdao which you can't get anywhere else which will please any beer enthusiast. The tour is a great way to spend an afternoon."
Impressive brewery tour,"This was a well-presented museum - one of the best we've been to in China.  Building A explains the history of Tsingtao Brewery then Building B shows parts of the old and new factories.  Our tickets entitled all of us to free beer to drink, including the children' tickets!?!  On our visit children's entry was 25RMB, and adult tickets were 50RMB or 70RMB with two free sausages.  All tickets included honey roasted peanuts.  My favourite part was watching the machinery in the actual factory moving the bottles around like a green glass ballet."
Great Brewery Tour,"Went here with the family, only in China would my children be given two free glasses of beer with the tour. Great self guided tour, in English and Chinese. Entry is RMB50 or RMB70 for two sausages and unlimited beer refills."
Worth One Visit,"The museum is located on a street near Tai Dong that is lined with bars, all serving Tsingtao Beer. When I walked down the street, outside every establishment were cases and cases of beer. The sewer covers have images depicting characters holding beer steins, and there are benches shaped like beer bottles. The whole area seems to embrace the beer theme. The price to enter was 50 RMB. Hold on to your ticket because you need to present it to get your ""free"" beer! I know very little about brewing, but seeing the old equipment was interesting, especially when considered in the context of Qingdao's history as a German concession. About 90% of the signs are translated (fairly well, compared to many others I've seen) into English. One room I liked a lot contained samples of barley to taste (I'd recommend just smelling) and several other raw materials to feel. The museum uses a variety of methods to tell its story. In one area a projected hologram shows a (presumably German) brewer taste testing the beer. There are mannequins set up in several rooms to show the process of making the beer at various stages. There are displays from the early days of the Tsingtao brand, including genuine old labels. Look closely and you'll see a Nazi symbol. One display that I was not too impressed with showed the evolution of bottles and labels since the brewery began. The ""labels"" had obviously been printed from a poor quality desktop printer, cut out by hand, and glued to the bottles. My thought is that if they're going to do such a shoddy job on this display, why even bother? Surely they have more memorabilia or authentic objects that could take its place.Twice during the tour you can present your ticket for a draft beer. During the first pit stop, they also provide nuts. The second beer is available at the end of the tour, when you reach the bar area. They also serve some food. There lots of seating, a stage, and a gift shop. Overall, I'm glad I went to the museum because I can now say I've had the experience, but I don't think it's worth a second visit. It would be a good rainy day activity if you have 1-2 hours to spare."
Fun and Educational Too!,"I went to this museum on my own.  It was very well design.  It had lots of information in english.  Everyone was having fun!  There were samples, games, movies and the drunken house which was quite funny. I was surprised that the toilet was rated at this tourist site....it was a 4 star, it was nice.  I am glad I went as I learnt the history of beer and beer in China."
Worth A Visit,Very interesting museum with the original beer making equipment introduced by the Germans still in very good condition. There is a bar and souvenir shop at the end of the tour where you can of course put your feet up and drink Tsing Tao beer.
Must see when you're in Qingdao,You must come visit the brewery for the most famous Chinese beer there is. Enjoy the history of the brewery and have a fresh one. Tip: Check out the restaurants by the entrance. There's really good seafood here. Find the restaurant with the most people and you can't go wrong!.
Great place for Tsingdao drinkers!,"I'll be honest, I'm not sure if this museum would be worth visiting for those who don't know about Tsingdao beer.  Nevertheless, if you live/lived in China or are any way familiar with Tsingdao beer, I personally think this museum is a must see, even if it is a little bit touristy.  The 50-60 kuai ticket does includes three different drinks (which are 150 ml each) and allows you to compare the drinks side by side which is really nice.  Exhibit A for me wasn't as interesting (since I knew about the history beforehand) but I really enjoyed Exhibit B and actually seeing part of the plant.  Regardless, I definitely enjoyed my time here and for you all semi-alcoholics in China, you will enjoy your trip here as well."
Better than your usual brewery vists,"You probably need to get a taxi here as it's a little out of the centre, but this is well worth a couple of hours of your time if you're at all interested in beer.The intiial reaction I felt as I walked through the gate was Willy Wonka^s chocolate factory. The big brewery building was magical, except for the big beer cans on the roof. The walking tour was really well-presented and also in English. I didn't bother with the audio guide. It took my from the early days of the brewery, through the war years and up to the present day. You also get to see some of the modern production line where they can and bottle the beer. Near the end you get a free glass of unfiltered beer and some nasty snacks, and then you end up at a great beer cellar. You could almost be in Munich. You get another free beer (clear this time) and can indulge in bratwurst and sauerkraut before heading off.I had a very enjoyable time and would recommend it."
Interesting story,"We visited the museum on Christmas Day. My husband was much more interested than me, but the tour gives good information about brewing beer that's of interest to anyone. The best part for me was the automated packing at the end though most people probably prefer the free samples! Worth a visit if you're interested in beer."
Interesting history,"Just when we thought there was nothing more to see, after having our free beer, we still could walk through the newer part of the factory.  Interesting."
"Learn the History of Tsingtao Beer, China's International Beer Export","I was not expecting much with this tour, and therefore came away pleasantly surprised. The history of Tsingtao Beer is much more interesting than I had expected. I knew somewhat about the role of the German's in brewing their brewing methods to Qingdao, but the rest of the story including both Japan and China was new to me. Another interesting feature is that there are two tasting rooms. One for ""raw"" beer"" and the other for ""draft beer"".All in all, a pleasant way to spend an hour or two."
An interesting place worth visiting,We spent about 2 hours there and learned a lot about the history  of this famous beer factory. Thanks to the Germans in early 20th century who introduced the brewery skill to China. Admission fee includes a free glass of raw beer together with a pack of peanuts.
THEE most popular tourist spot in Qingdao,The name of the beer is Tsingtao and was built by the Germans and produced its first beer in 1903.  A complete story of how beer is made is presented and a free beer at the end.
Informative tour,"It is located near to the beer street. Nice place to learn about the process of beer processing. Based on the entrance ticket, you are entitled for 2 cups of beer and nuts."
Great museum-well organized,Qingdao is a hard place to be if you only speak English.  This museum was well organized and everything in English. But no one speaks English or understands. We really enjoyed  it.
Great,Lovely to see how they have preserved ancient factory machinery which is on display. Best part is testing raw beer which is so refreshing and taste amazing. Must ser
A nice history of Qingdao brewery and the culture of beer in Qingdao,"We throughly enjoyed our trip to the Qingdao Beer Museum. We went on Halloween night and they had a ""Night at the Beer Museum"" event. We took a tour of the brewery, were provided with an English guide, and had fun. We got to have a nice raw beer on the tour with some peanuts. My wife and I plan to return during the day time on a weekend soon. This is a great idea for families, or even a group of people."
Must visit in Qingdao!,We joined the beer tour when we were in Qingdao and was amazed by the wide selection of Qingdao beers. We definitely recommend the beer museum to all visitors to Qingdao!
Beer lovers,My partner and I had a very good experience and had learnt a great deal on the History of The Qingdao Beer and The City its selfWorth the visitThe Beer is Cheaper to buy on the street out side of the Museum
Comprehensive,"One of the must-visit attractions in Qingdao, after all, the first thing that comes to mind when Qingdao is mentioned is the beer. There are guided tours available in English and Chinese, but if you feel like taking your own pace then you can choose not to hire a guide. I've been here twice, once with a guide and once without. There's not much difference for me since I can speak both languages. My friends who don't speak Chinese did say the English guided tour is helpful. While the museum tour is comprehensive, I must say the highlight is the draft that they serve here. The taste is simply above that of any Qingdao beer variations I've ever tried.This place is like a checklist item, you can't say you've been to Qingdao without visiting the Qingdao Beer Museum."
Okay,"If you go, I definitely recommend to take a guided tour. Otherwise, you won't get a lot of information out of it. With the guided tour, you also get a beer tasting in the end. It is okay, but I wouldn't say it's something you have to do.."
Interesting,I liked the history of the beer making and the good beer they served. Interesting for kids n adults alike
BEEEEEER!,The beer museum was pretty good. It was a little hard to find but you get a free small beer and some peanuts and you can say you have been to the first and largest brewery in China! I mean Tsingtao is famous so it was cool to see the origin.
"Qindao Beer on draft, what can I say !!!",Pretty interesting place. I just happen to be very close so I stopped in to take a look. Lots of German influence since they did start the company. The building was also built by the Germans and has a nice touch of both Eastern and Western cultures.
110 years of Beer history for a world class beer,"Interesting presentation of beer making in the 1900 and today,From a piece of equipment that washes 4 bottles of beer at a time to productions Of tens of cans per second!!!!!From packing a bottle at a time with straw to a modern industrial production line,Enjoyable hour in the midst of Beer a Street in downtown Qingdao.Private tour guide for our group was nice but could have spoken slightly better English,Knew her script but had limited ability to answer questions."
"Nothing new, but still fun.","The tour wasn't terribly special. But, it was an interesting thing to see. I had a great time at the end with the food and beer, good place for a quick bite and drink and to learn about the history of Tsingtao."
Well worthwhile for beer fans and alike,"Take a trip through the history of the most famous Chinese beer brand. From the establisment by the Germans - into a worldwide exporting firm. TsingTao beer museum is differently worthwhile, stroll down beerstreet afterwards."
worth a visit for beer fans,"Worth a visit and English displays are included everywhere, though crowded during our visit. Particularly enjoyed seeing the bottling and packaging production line at the end, tasting the raw/fresh beer, and having the option to buy and drink different varieties at the end of the tour (I enjoyed the dark Tsing Tao and have never seen it elsewhere)."
Great Couple Hour Excursion,I had a couple of hours in the afternoon and this was a nice choice.  My english speaking tour guide was terrific and eager to answer questions.
A great tour,"Really enjoyed this tour. We paid an extra 60RMB for an english speaking guide. Her english was great. The production line was unfortunately closed due to sterilisation, but we still enjoyed the tour."
Good beer & good food...  what else do you need?,"Love the museum especially the beer tasting part.  Better than I was expected!  Also, the museum is located on the ""beer street"" that is famous for local restaurants.  We had amazing seafood lunch across the street after the tour."
Worthwhile visit not to be missed while in Qingdao,"With TsingTao being our favorite brand of beer, a visit to this museum was a must. The museum has a nice display of all the history of the brewery, but it is no different from any other large brewery in the world. We were surprised by the variety of different beers they brew since we only know one kind. The raw and unfiltered beer offered for free at the end of the tour is a real delicacy. Unfortunately during our visit the place was really crowded and it was sometimes difficult to view some of the exhibits."
Art,"This building has a history to be told, which was done partially. Some few items remained from the Germans,  and historic development of the factory. In other words, seek the area history in this place.Many brands are not in the showroom though of their old existenceadvise: THE 4D Show sucks, go for the snack."
beer,Enjoyed a lot. This beer factory is started by Germans and around 100 years old. English speaking guides available .
Great Tingdao Beer and Factory Tour,The Tingdao Beer Factory Tour is a self-guided tour that is located in an actual beer producing factory.  The tour take you through the entire process of making beer - from the hops to the refining of the beer.  The best part of the tour is the sample glasses of the beer and beer nuts.  Great tasting beer!  The tour is interesting and a must see place to visit while in Qingdao.
An interesting beer museum.,A fun way to spend a couple of hours. The history is interesting and there is enough to keep beer enthusiasts interested. It helps that the beer is delicious too!
Beer musuem,Good place for learning about the most popular beer in China. This place will fullfill your China interesting.
Great tour and good fun ,"I went with 2 friends as we learnt all about the history of Tsingtao, sampling the many beers and getting our photo taken on a bottle of Tsingtao. A good half day outing and worth a visit."
Interesting Tour,"Icon of Qingdao. Good for learning more about beer brewing, coupled with beer tasting and snacks (different type of tickets will include different stuff). Take a pic and have them paste it on the label. Cheers!"
Couple of hours in a ordinary saturday,"I spent couple of hours in an ordinary saturday. I was with a colleague. The area of museum related to ""old"" way of doing beer and the one to ""modern"" as well, were good for an easy going morning . You can also see the process of bottling that is always interesting if you never see one before. Finally you can also taste beer."
Fun With Friends,"This was a great place to visit and if you are in Qingdao with friends you should totally check it out. We may have already been a bit tipsy when we started our visit due to having just eaten lunch on beer street outside! (we ""accidentally"" ordered 3 jugs of beer not three pints...) Which was actually probably a good way to visit as it makes the advertising element even funnier. Also it was great going with friends as it gave more opportunities for messing around (though not at other tourists expense, we are concientious travellers!) and having fun drinking the free beers and learning about the infamous ""bottle brush incident""! It isn't the best beer museum I have been to but it was very fun and quite interesting, I would have preferred a bit more of a visit to the factory floor but for those who don't know much about the beer making process it is very interesting."
German built and an interesting tour,The beer half way round!!!! and the bottle i brought home with my photo on the label. get this taken during the tour pick up the bottle when leaving a unique memento.
Perfect Afternoon,"This self-guided tour of the Museum & Brewery is the perfect way to spend a couple of hours with friends. The tour includes the historic part of the brewery, as well as the modern....capped off with beer tastings!!"
You don't have to be a beer lover to enjoy the Qingdao Beer Museum,"You don't have to be a beer lover to enjoy the Qingdao Beer Museum. The tour takes you through a historical account of the brewery, showing various brewing artifacts from different periods. You can see the fermentation tanks , and the beer bottling plant. There is a beer tasting room on the toor."
Get your own personalized TsingTao Beer!,"Worth a visit, especially if you have not been to beer factories. I enjoyed seeing the old brewery vs the new modern one. Signs are both English and Chinese but for RMB60 you can get an English speaking guide. At the end of the tour, you can enjoy a glass of beer and a small bag of peanuts. Highlight of the trip would be having your picture on your own bottle of TsingTao Beer for RMB35."
For beer lovers,"Took my 8 year old twins on the tour. One of them at half price, the shorter one was free.The tour, which is self guided was quite interesting. The displays were a bit dated and some historical pieces were clearly photoshopped copies, not the real deal. The top view of the modern production line was interesting to see. Kinda hypnotising. When we got to a tasting of raw fresh beer  the paying 8 year old got ticket for her beer as well. I did the responsible fatherly thing and took it of her and had to suffer through to serves of tasty fresh raw beer. The same happened at the end of the tour with the filtered final product tasting."
fun way to spend a couple of hours,"great day trip, fast, fun & a free taste of beer. Our guide spoke good English and was helpful too. The tour isn't too long, with enough information to take in and understand. The 'drunken house' is a fun ending to the tour"
Fascinating tour not just beer lovers,"This was an unexpected treat,I didn't expect to like so much.The museum was interesting easy to follow reading as you went along.Fun stops along the way also that made us laugh I won't share so you can be surprised as we were.If time allows go!Those samples so good and not a bad size.We also purchased some good gifts in the gift shop to bring home."
Qingdao Beer Museum,"Came here with some friends while we were in Qingdao for the weekend, and it was well worth the visit. Lots of informative displays, some interactive features, a sneak peak at the inner workings of the factory, past and present, and a beer sample at the end. Definitely a good choice if you have a few hours to spare."
"Informative , especially if you like beer.","Part of an organized tour, this was a nice stop.  The history of Tsingtao Beer is explained in periods of time, as you walk through the museum and plant.  Free beer tasting is available (part of your admission) at the end.  All-in-all, not a bad tour, and the beer was good.  Hope this helps for your first visit."
Better Than Expected,"If you are in China, you'll most likely encounter Tsingtao Beer! Well, the beer is brewed in Qingdao, China. Of course, I had to go check it out during my recent visit to Qingdao! My expectations for the visit were quite low. China usually isn't the best in presentation with touristy areas. However, while not the best place I've ever been, I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of information, both Chinese and English, that informed about the history of the beer and how they became the company they are today. There were a lot of interactive exhibits that were tastefully displayed. Not only did I learn about the company, but also about how beer is made! Of course, the free sample of beer helped! At the end, there is a good gift shop with reasonably priced items. Two hours is enough time to see the museum. Afterwards, the street adjacent to the museum is lined with restaurant after restaurant that want you to pay a visit, take a load off your feet, and enjoy some Tsingtao beer! So, if you have time, it is rather fun. If you are in Qingdao and you have time, I'd definitely add this to your itinerary of places to vist!"
Easy tour & free beer,"This museum is okay, nothing over the top. Provides a history of Tsingtao Beer of takes approx an hour. Various ticket types sold, basic one goes for 60RMB which entitles you to two half pints, another sells for 80RMB which entitles you to as much beer as you can drink. English and Chinese maps are available with the ticket purchase, no need to get a guide as the tour is pretty simple and self explanatory. At some point during the tour, everyone gets a free half pint of freshly made beer with peanuts which is very tasty I must say. The free beer is available in the bar at the end of the tour. In case you like the peanuts that came with your beer, there is a shop in the bar area that sells some - feel free to stock up as I did."
Excellent insight into the city,We toured the museum and small factory last weekend and found it very informative. We went mid-morning when it was not too crowded. All of the displays have English explanations and offer a great insight into the history of both beer and Qingdao.  It was a Sunday so only a small part of the factory was operating. At the end of the tour we were given a delicious brew.          Back out on the street there are endless cafes serving more Tsing Dao.  It's a very pleasant way to spend a few hours in the city.
good tour,pretty thorough tour with taste testing.  Interesting history.  The english guide spoke very well and was knowledgeable
Fascinating History of China's Best Known Beer,"Who knew that China's Tsingtao beer has its origins in German brewing?  I certainly did not but upon entering the museum it becomes readily apparent.  Except for some changes in the blends to include rice, it's pretty much the same as it was 112 years ago.  The museum gives you a tour from 1903 to present by taking you through the old German style buildings containing some of the original brewery equipment and on into today's ultramodern #1 brewing plant where they fill bottles and cans at an incredible pace.  You're given the opportunity to try some unfiltered beer during the tour and at the end you get to enjoy the final product.  All in all, a very worthwhile stop whenever in Qingdao."
Fun afternoon!,"Visited here with a friend a few months ago and really enjoyed it, well worth the money, I think around 100rmb and included two beers, one fresh and one tap, and interesting tour of the old factory ad the new one includin a drunk room which is really fun to use! Would recommend it to a friend!"
Free beer and some good laughs,"The tour is a bit disjointed, but still interesting.   Nice multi-media surprise along the way.    Diplomatic discussion of German occupation of Qingdao too."
Decent and fun museum!,The museum was enjoyable and entertaining!  The ticket was 60 RMB and that included a small glass of beer and peanuts at the end of the museum.  The information is laid out nicely and easy to follow.   You can also get your photo on a beer bottle!  Overall it was a fun experience while in Qingdao!
Excellent exhibition of Qingdao beer and the origin,"Firstly, it's spelled ""QING DAO"" NOT THE WADE-GILE ""TSING-TAO"". The historical origin came from Germany. At the beginning of the 20th century end of the 19th century, Germans brought their finest ingredients to the port city of Qingdao to brew some of the finest beers. I can say that beer bottles are everywhere here in this museum and tasting the sample can definitely bring me happiness and memories)) Visited back in Oct 2011."
A fun place to visit,Who can pass a visit to a beer factory and museum? It is actually quite good and interesting.The can even give you a beer bottle with a label with your photo on it (35RMB). Interesting stuff in the shop as well and a free beer.My only regret was that I was in a hurry to catch my train and could not hang around for more beer.
Great History Tour of Tsingtao Beer,The Qingdao Beer Museum provides a well-organized tour of its history.  It is one of the best museums that I have visited in China.  The entrance fee is reasonable and also includes a beer tasting and sausages at the end of the tour.  Definitely worth the 1.5-2 hours.
One of the best museums in China!,"The museum is well designed, clean, very educational and one of the best museums I've visited in China during my 4 years living here. Even if you're not a big fan of beer, this museum will have lots to interest you. It talks about the German influence on Qingdoa and China, how WWII and the Nazi's influenced their production, etc. There's some really cool and unexpected things you'll learn, like how the locals used to by beer in white plastic grocery bags . . . . yes, not bottled, just pored straight into a plastic bag and carried home!The museum is kid friend too and adults will be treated to at least 2 samples right off the production floor."
Outstanding Experience,"This is a fantastic museum. You get a combination of Tsingtao history, beer information, and old brewing and modern brewing techniques. This was an extremely well rounded museum...plus you can drink beer! The 60 RMB entrance fee is quite reasonable as are the gift shop and bar prices (15 RMB for a half liter of of unfiltered beer). It was a fun transition from viewing old brewing equipment to a modern bottling/canning factory. Worth every RMB!!!"
German History in Qingdao,"We had a perfect introduction in to the history of beer, in the German ex-colony of Qingdao. The Visit of the Tsingtao Brewery is a must!Just the glasses for testing the golden liquid have been a little bit to small. At the end of the tour you‚Äôll find a nice restaurant where you can get German sausages and other food."
Last minute pitcher of Raw Beer,"We had though the brewery was open late during the week but we were wrong. Convinced the staff to sell us a pitcher of beer, the promise was we had to consume it in 20 minutes. Being a typically Canadian, always up for a challenge, we accepted. The raw beer, only good for 24 hours, is fresh from the tanks and tastes excellent compared to the pasturized product that goes into Kegs or bottles. Completed the task with time to spare, will come back when we are in the area."
Learn about China's most famous beer!,"Other reviewers have pretty well covered why this is such a cool attraction in this city, in the midst of urban beaches, parks, and colonial-era European-style buildings, but IMHO no visit to the Tsingtao Brewery Museum is complete without a banquet at one of the excellent Shandong cuisine restaurants across the street. Shandong cuisine is renowned in China for relatively lightly-fried, aromatic dishes, with Qingdao dishes in particular emphasizing fresh seafood (but there's plenty of pork, veggies, and other standard Chinese delights!). And the restaurants across from the brewery offer the freshest Tsingtao beer on tap, including the impossible to find 'hei pi' (stout). Best time to go is a weekday noon, April to November."
Learn about Tsingtao ,"It's a quite interesting museum, I would recommend taking a foreign language guide which is only 50rmb, the entrance is 50 rmb as well but it includes access to both exhibitis A and B, here you will learn about the history of the iconic beer of China. It's a good place to spend free time, it's located in a weird area of the city don't be discouraged by the surroundings."
An excellent brewery tour,"Think of beer, think of China, you get Tsingtao. Started by German colonials in1903, stolen by the  Japanese  and returned to China after the war. This is a true success story, with a interesting heritage. If you have an interest in brewing, industrial architecture or just beer you will enjoy this. From the colonial buildings, to the oldest surviving Siemens engine, floor maltings to holographic brewers. Enjoy a free taste of raw beer and compare it to the finished product. A good value visit at only CNY50."
One of the places must visit in Qingdao,One of the successful corporate from China with strong brand name and quality products.  The museum provides good knowledge about beer manufacturing process and to taste the raw beer.
Well worth a visit when in Qingdao,"A visit to Qingdao, the beer capital of Asia, would not be complete without visiting the beer museum.The original brewery turned into a museum, with a great story on the history and evolution of the famous brand. a great way to spend an hour or two.. Qingdao also plays host to the International Beer Festival for 2 weeks every August."
Great History,Styla the concierge from our hotel gave his time off to accompany us in our hire car to show us around Qingdao. On the mention of Tsingtao Beer he told us the beer's origin is from Qingdao  which amazed my husband. He does not drink beer but was delight to visit the museum/factory. It was very interesting to learn about Tsingtao beer which has a great history. One has to walk through the museum to understand where it all started from the German era.Around Qingdao one can see the German influence from home structures to statues in the park to the beer being produced. There is a small scale of beer still being produced at this museum/factory. At the end of the tour one can taste the beer. I don't drink beer but I must say the beer was light and refreshing. It is a must see attraction in Qingdao.
