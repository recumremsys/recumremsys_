"""awesome experience""",Can't describe the sensation of the expertise.It's impressive expertise.Would like to have it once more.I am fan of railway a well as hills that is why it had been sort of a dream come back true i used to be extremely jumping after I got my tickets ensure and extremely favorite to ride.There area unit some stunning views in train which may not be seen by road trip.And it'll be best if you climb from mettupalayam to Ooty it's new expertise it runs with external-combustion engine from Mettupalayam to coonur and that is most fun half train lit rally climb in tilting manner
Memorable Journey,"We took nilgiri train journey from ooty to metupalaiyam. Train route was developed during british era and still running by steam engine in half section of the route. Picturesque journey though mountains, valley, waterfalls, tunnels and tea plantation is really unforgettable experience. Overall scenic journey though lush green forest is paradise for nature lover.  For comfort level it is advisable to take first class ticket. In tourist season advance online reservation is must as limited seats are available. There are 8 seats in one coupe for 1st class coach.Train stop at coonoor station for a brief period of time where you can get down and stretch your legs.  This is a must experience journey in ooty."
A little throwback in time to travel through the valley,"Enjoyed the experience of riding from Mettupalayam back to Ooty, but wasted a lot of time in the day queueing BEFORE the ticket office opened one hour before the journey to ensure a place, having missed all the tickets earlier in the day for the opposite direction. Please note for enthusiasts, this is not the steam section of the journey. Being able to buy advanced tickets would have given us more time to enjoy the surrounding area."
Very picturesque,"Really enjoyed the journey, purchased 1st class tickets, but only seemed to be authenticated on the day of travel.We were the only passengers in our compartment so were very comfortable. Were given a complimentary bottle of water and some local goodies in a bag. The train travels very slowly so can see the beautiful scenery. Wouldn’t have wanted to miss this trip."
Must visit,This is a must visit. There are scheduled trips from Ooty to Coonoor and back which need to be booked an hour in advance. We took the last trip so we got the tickets just in time. We took a train from Ooty and conooor and returned by bus. Quite convenient and must try for the awesome views
View ,The view from the train is really good. One should preferably take the evening train from Ooty to Connor.
Heavenly,The last train begins at 5 in pity and the journey is just heavenly. This is a must to do activity for nature lovers.
Interesting journey,"Booked by our tour company before we left UK. We had a reserved seat in First class Not ultra comfortable, but room for luggage. Thew style of the carriages is similar to the old style british rail trains with individual compartments for either 4 or 8 people-there's no corridor to walk down the carriage. We did the trip from Both to Coonoor and it took approx 1 hr 10 minutes. Beautiful scenery on both sides of the train but sadly the windows were quite opaque and you certainly could not take good photos through them. However, there were some opening windows.There were 3 stations on route, only 2 minute stop at each. No toilets on the train.Coonoor is fascinating because there is an engine shed there and a couple of old steam locos. It seems quite the norm to be able to get into the cabs of the trains in order to have photos taken. Theres an amusing sign in the station - 'While posing for selfies, look for approaching trains'!!"
A short time travel,"We have traveled for a short distance from Ooty to Coonoor . It was an excellent journey to enjoy a heritage toy train experience🚂. We have traveled just 1.15 hours to reach the up and down destinations which we booked for. We couldn't enjoy the up and downhill journey to Mettupalayam from Oooty as we have only booked for a short trip. For all the trips/trains, you need to do book the tickets from any stations at least 3-4 hours earlier to make sure the seats."
One of the best trip,"Awesome trip with nilgiri toy train...I would suggest to get the train from Mettupalayam to Connor..Its the best route to njoy the train journey.. All the beauty of nilgiri is between these two station... Connor to Udagamandalam ( Ooty ) only nilgiri trees no bridge , no waterfall..And for comfortable journey book first class.. There is no place for luggage in second class. There is one more train which is special train. I dont know the timing but you can find it on IRCTC..."
Swiss Rack System Railway Trip,"We travelled from Coonor Station to Mettupalayam pulled by steam train on this Swiss Rack System.  If you take the full trip from Ooty then the first part to Coonor is by diesel train.  There is quite a bit to see at Coonor Station, with access to the sheds, so make sure that you arrive in plenty of time to have a look around.Pre book first class seats, they aren't that comfortable but better than standard, and the conditions even in first class are cramped with 8 seats to a compartment.  We fell lucky as there were only 4 of us in it or it would have been very uncomforatable, squeezed in side by side.The journey takes over two hours as the train winds itself along the route at a very slow pace, to be honest the journey was rather tiring and a bit too long, so I woudln't recommend doing the whole journey from Ooty as our fellow travellers had done.Our journey was spoilt somewhat as the train arrived at coonor a mist come down and you could hardly see more than a few feet in front of you, so the views were not that good.  I was amazed at the speed the mist came it was minutes and had been a glorious day up until then.  The journey is split at Hillgrove Station for 15 minutes so you could get off the train and stretch your legs.The journey was enjoyable we were at the back and watched the back man turning the train as we traversed the hills.  Young children waved from dangerously close to the track as we passed, but given the slow speed they were not in that much danger!Would I recommend it - yes it has to be done and it is charming in it's own way - just take something comfortable to sit on and cross your fingers for a clear day!"
First travel,"This is my first travel booked from ooty to metupalaiyam, need to book tickets before 3 months, only 90 seats available for booking, gud experience. Enjoyed the trip"
Beautiful journey,"We took the train from Coonor up to Ooty, early in the morning. We sat at the very front (behind the guard). Fabulous views, amazing experience. Toured Ooty when we arrived and took a car back down to Coonor at the end of the day. A must do holiday experience."
An old touch of India ,"So we took the toy train up the mountain for a morning of leisure. It was a lovely outing and lots if picture opportunities. A wonder around town and lunch was all very jolly. But there were a lot of people everywhere, plenty of noise and more of the same at the top. Think a first class ride would have added to the experience."
Beautiful,"May be because I visited Ooty on a weekday in an off ish season the train and the stations were less crowded less noisy and hence much more enjoyable. I traveled till Connor and back in first class compartment taking window seat. The journey was beautiful and memorable. In my knowledge advance booking is not offered.I don't remember exactly but it costed me Rs 185 one way.The train compartments as well as intermediate stations were safe ,clean, tidy and maintained ."
Must do in Ooty,".We took the 0900 train from Ooty to CoonoorIt was a short, yet unique experience.We enjoyed very much traveling  together with the tourists and the locals on this special train"
Must travel in this toy train,"This is one of the best experience we had in ooty. We traveled from ooty to coonoor in this train. This train passes through dense Forest, pine trees, valley, tunnels, mountains etc etc. There are hardly few small gauge trains in India. And this is one of them. It's a must visit in ooty and the view is amazing. First class tickets will cost 180. If you are going during peak season try and book the tickets online before hand. Else you can also buy the tickets at the counter which opens an hour before departure. There aren't many trains throughout the day so do check the schedule before you go."
Must to do .. Must to do .. Must to do,"The plan was to see Connoor and return to Mettupalayam. We had booked the NMR - Heritage train to Connoor from Udhagamandalam railway station. Post breakfast, we checked out and reached the railway station by 8:45 AM. The train was at 9:15 AM. This is one of the things to do in the bucket list and the urge to go on one of the most popular and memorable train journeys in India was Done once boarded the train. Truly, the views on either side and going through the tunnels was very satisfying and fascinating.The train stopped in 4 stations inbetween - Lovedale, Ketti, Aravankadu and Wellington. The train has 3 reserved coaches - 1 for FC and 2 for SC. We took the ride in SC as it was shorter ride and no much difference between both classes. There are no toilets in the train.We had left the luggages back in the car and the car reached the Connoor railway station before us and waited to pick us up."
Absolutely amazing experience,During our holiday in Ooty we had boarded the Nilgiri mountain railway for the fun experience from Ooty to Coonoor. The train winds its way through the hills offering mesmerizing views of valleys and nature in general. It was an amazing experience.
Coolest,This train is so nice for kids and adults. We can enjoy here so much. This train gives different happiness. This train is best option to travel in Ooty.
Unimpressive,"The road between Ooty and Coonoor (or the road to Mysore or a quick trip to the Hill Station) are far more scenic and take less time. The windows on the train were so dirty, it was hard to see out of them, and if you weren't right by the window, it was even harder."
A good way to take in the scenery,We took a trip on the railway as far as Coonar and saw some spectacular scenery on the way. Relaxing and enjoyable excursion
Toy train enjoyed a lot,"I am a nature lover, while going in toy train we can see whole beauties of Ooty, with my friends it is most rememberable trip for us .The steam engine was really awesome.....I recommend to all, to take a ride in it ... ."
Joy ride,"Amazing views and awesome experience. Watching nature at its best. Do not miss this if you are in ooty. Book tickets in advance through IRCTC website or else you will have to stand in a big queue on the day of your journey & there is very less chances that you will get a ticket specially during peak season. During the train journey, the tunnels, bridges, tea garden, clouds, Nilgiri forest and the view are just mind blowing."
Toy train narrow guage line,"It's a train you should board and would say the vacation remains incomplete if missed. Runs from ooty to Conoor 1 hr ride and passes through scenic hills, sideby roads and some tunnels as well. Would suggest to board 9.15 am train in morning to reach Conoor to enjoy freshness in morning with amazing valley view"
Good one,"First thing this is a trap. Ticket line is 1 hour, train 1 hour and coming back to Ooty 2 hours. Unless you take 9 am train your entire day is gone. Do not forget to sit on right side when you enter for better view.Be careful on how you plan your day. There are limited restaurants in Coonoor, close to train station- Venkys is good one. Enjoy ..."
Enjoyed a lot with toy train,"It's was unforgettable trip in toy train, we took train from mettupalayam to ooty,It is really amazing trip....Highly recommended to go....."
Great photo opportunities ,"This trip was in doubt due to heavy rain and landslide but found out 2 hrs before that the toy train would be running.Station is lovely and some great views on the route despite rain and cold . Wrap up warm. Read about the history of the train at Ooty station on your return, very interesting."
An amazing journey through toy train,"If you are visiting Ooty then this is a train journey of a lifetime. The toy train route of nearly 46 km from Mettupalayam to Ooty will take you through the valleys and pass through numerous bridges and mountains. The best part about the train journey is that the route from Mettupalayam to Coonoor is covered by the train using steam locomotive which is itself is an amazing experience.Apart from that the valley view, the curves on the route and the lush green forests that the train passes through make it one amazing journey. The journey takes around 5 hrs and if you get a first-class ticket (online reservation is the best option) then the journey truly becomes wonderful.However, if you are not keen on sitting for 5 hrs then you can also cut short the journey by traveling between Coonoor and Ooty which would be a journey of around 75 mins. Also, this route has more services than from Mettupalayam. But the journey on the whole 46 km is recommended since the route becomes more scenic after Coonoor."
Joy train,I started my journey from Udagamandalam railway station to Conoor. Ticket availability is difficult. One has to stand in Q for long hours. But luckily I got the ticket. Journey is Good. Good view can be seen.Fare is too much. For Ist class Rs.185/- for one side. General ticket or second class ticket never available.
Joy train,"The real beauty to be admired is to travel from Mettupalayam to Ooty. It's like a wonder I appreciate the work done by the team who made it. The guidance given at A ooty Honey Huts, ooty made me travel and experience."
A must when in Ooty,Got the train to Coonoor and spent a few hours there. Unfortunately it was cloudy so visibility was poor but it cleared for the return journey. Nearly came to blows with someone on the return as they were sat in our designated seats. The company had changed our seat numbers but failed to inform us! Went first class coming back but there was more leg room in the ‘cheap seats’.
The best way to travel with great scenery thrown in,"During my visit, the famous rack and pinion steam-operated section to Coonoor was closed due to a landslide on 28 November 2019 with reopening originally expected on 3 December but deferred until Sunday 8 due to heavy rains on 1 and 2 December.This was most disappointing but I still enjoyed the one hour trip each way (with three tunnels and historic bridges) from Ooty to Coonoor at a bargain fare of Rs. 35 each way.One cannot purchase a return fare at either end of the 'toy train' short section.  The booking office at Ooty opens an hour before each of the four daily trains.  At Coonoor, for some strange reason it only opens half an hour before.In Coonoor I hired an auto rickshaw to take me on an hour long tour to St John The Baptist Catholic Church and the shut down for a couple of months due to off season Highfield Tea Factory with its vintage 1930 processing equipment.  The one hour trip cost a bargain Rs.300.The train trip is scenic even just to Coonoor from Ooty, and a 'must do.'There is a railway dining room at Ooty as well as railway retiring rooms (seven accommodation rooms.)  The gardens at Ooty station are beautiful while above the station a Southern Railway steam loco and carriage are displayed."
"Great experience, good speed","It was great experience travelling in the train with the kind of view available around. It was raining on that day so it become even thrilling to see clouds around and cool, clean air around. I like those king of things so find it just great."
A wonderful ride on toy train,"If you come to Ooty you must experience a ride from Ooty alias udagamandalam to Conoor, could not get this trip due to landslips while I visited but yes had a opportunity to enter the Train and the platform with a platform ticket of ₹10, could also visit a 1:1 model of this toy train opposite to the platform. The railway platform and premises are well maintained by the ministry.Train schedules attached"
Amzing place to visit,"This is an amazing place to visit with family and friends. If you have come here by bus/train, choose local cabs to sightseeing, they are not run by ola or uber instead of local tours and travels. Must buy a ticket of toy train. If you are tourist or from anyother part and don't know how to book just be there early morning at railways stations and you should be able to get ticket,1 person can get 4 tickets max."
Heritage Train ,It's very beautiful and scenic view during the train journey. You can't put down your camera for a second. Thrilled and joyous.
Exquisite views on an old narrow-gauge,"What fun to board a very old narrow-gauge rail line for a beautiful journey through the mountains. That said, two hours is quite enough. We recommend boarding in Ooty and disembarking at the first major stop in Coonoor. Then, you can return the same way you came, making this a round-trip journey."
Awesome views during Mountain Train Trip,We enjoyed the ride of Ooty mountain train in October 2019. We traveled from Udagamandalam to Coonoor. During journey we enjoyed valley views from mountain train. Must visit once in life time.
A must for Ooty Trip,"A small but nature packed short trip which will not only excite you but give you pleasure of another level. Its a very short travel but very interesting one. Passing through tunnels and scenic beauty all around. Eucalyptus forest, tea gardens, step farming fields, playgrounds, stadium are just aweeome."
Unforgettable experience  .......,"This is a totally different experience, one must travel on toy train when you visit Ooty. The train, route and tunnel everything thing is full of photo opportunity. The toy train will be loved by kids a lot. The travel is from Ooty to coonoor passing through scenic mountain, Forest and tunnel. The travel time is 1 hour and every min you will enjoy the trip. It is better to have reservations before hand to avoid Last minute rush and traveling in general compartment. First class is bit costly but it is most comfortable than others compartment. Don't forget to carry good camera or good phone to take as many pictures as possible. On Ooty station we can see the museum and souvenir shop to take away some memories with you."
Nilgiri Mountain Railways,Nilgiri Mountain Railways is one of the best train rides in India. People love this train journey very much.
Awesome,"Must be in itinerary when visiting Ooty,Coonoor. Breathtaking experience , natural beauty. One should book nilgiri railway from Ooty to Mettupalayam and vice versa."
Beautiful Train ride between Ooty to Coonoor.,"There are 2 trains here. One taking you from Mettupalayam to Ooty via Coonor when you enter Ooty if not by car or bus. or the short Ooty-Coonor and back ride for sightseeing. Either way you will get to ride the train. Ooty - Coonoor is 1 hour ride covering beautiful small Bollywood film like stations like Lovedale. This you can do on own going to station travelling till Coonoor and back if you came by road and missed the bigger train ride up here. Like Matheran toy train one of the few surviving old British narrow gauge railway tracks. Its a great break for sightseeing. There are some valley points at Coonoor. depends if you choose a tour taxi, bus or train ride on own. If you take a package tour you get 2 types of tours - Ooty / Coonoor local tour including  lake boating, valley points, local gardens, train ride etc. second is Jungle tour that takes you to ooty - Madamalai Jungle and back via Pykar lake. if package has both tours well and good. Else do local tour on easily and choose Jungle paid tour as it is outside city far off and return takes late night. if you have pvt car you can drive out of Ooty seeing Madamalai/Pykar route on won if you head towards Mysore-Bangalore."
Amazing Experience,"Toy train ride was always on my bucket list since childhood. Finally got a chance on this tour to Ooty. We booked the tickets from Ooty to Coonoor through IRCTC one month prior to the journey but couldn't get the tickets for the 1st Class,so booked the 2S (Second Sitting). Train is clean but seats are congested. 10 seats in one compartment.The view from Ooty to Coonoor was mesmerizing. I enjoyed the ride and was happy that my childhood dream was fulfilled."
Nice Experienve,Wow Enjoyed the travel.All should travel once in a your lifeBeautiful clicks and enjoyed wellSuper means superbThanks
Fabulous experience..felt like old times ,"Heritage train from Conoor to Ooty started almost 125 years back. Lovely views of the landscape, tea gardens .A must try!!"
Nostalgic Heritage Train Journey!,"While in Ooty, we friends took a ride in the Heritage Nilgiris Railways from Ooty to Conoor.The journey was real fun with beautiful scenery on both sides and kids enjoying every moment of the trip. The fun part were the tunnels! Whenever a tunnel came young and old whistled or screamed, making the journey more exciting.A trip on this Heritage Train is a must for all visitors to Ooty...."
Family reunion,Should enjoy the ride. Quiet well advanced pre planning to book and enjoy this trip is necessary. Can improve the distances covered till Coonoor.
Must experience..,"We booked tickets well in advance between ooty to Coorg and return from Coorg to ooty. The train passes through Nilgiri mountain and gives you view of beautiful flora, fauna, scenery etc. suggest you to book ticket well in advance as there are limited seats available."
Ooty trip,I had to wait for almost 1:30 hrs in the queue for the train ticket. There were only 56 seats available for the 1st class and remaining 130 general.I did not find any of the passenger was excited after this trip!Seats are very congested & the view from the train is very ordinary. Take a cab & explore the beautiful surrounding.There are many other beautiful places to visit in Ooty and coonoor don't waste your valuable time for this ride!
mesmerising viewa,"view outsite is very gud but not inside, trains are average. but the natural beauty of the place is unmatched.. go just after rainy season"
Too cramped to fully enjoy the experience,We prebooked a 2S ticket online. It was really cramped and neither enough space to stand. On top of that small kids don't get a ticket or a seat.It's a nice experience traveling through the hills but you can get the same view by car as well.To really get a train experience there should be more space and should be able to walk within compartments.
Great joyride for scenic beauty and a leasurely evening,"We had booked the ticket from Coonoor to Ooty through IRCTC portal, months ago. The station at Coonoor was buzzing with crowd, mostly locals as well as tourists like us. We had the First Class compartment, the first one in the train, so we got a great view as the train passes through the hills, valleys and tunnels. The stoppage at stations like Lovedale, Wellington etc was very serene. While the kids made some new friends with kids of other travelling families, for us elders, it was no less fun in leisurely chitchat. P.S. - Please make sure you book the tickets in advance, else there will be a long queue at the station and you might get disappointed without a ticket"
Toy Train,You can plan for this train ride if you want to see the mountain pass of Ooty and Conoor. Reservations can be done from IRCTC website.
Please do not take FS1 coupe seats unless you are train enthusiast,I had read stellar reviews for the train and based on the reviews booked first class coupe. On arrival I found that normal first class was so nice and ours was the original train compartment from old times. It was not comfortable and windows were small.We took the train from Ooty to Conoor but the views that came were already seen by us on ours trip to Avalanhe/Madhumalai/9th mile drive so we were not that awestruck.
Beautiful old fashioned rail trip partly with steam engine!,"Beautiful scenery and fortunately as we started descending, the weather cleared up so a good view was available. Only thing is there seemed to little or no maintenance of the plant growth at the side of the tracks, which seemed to be almost growing wild and blocked the view on a number of occasions. Also, limited amenities (food/water etc) are available at the stations and some vendors seemed only too eager to take full advantage of the situationFrom Ooty to Conoor, the train is drawn by a diesel engine and from Conoor to Mettupalayam by a coal fired steam engine.Note: we visited Ooty in May 2018, but due to some exigencies I posted later and July 2018 was the earliest date possible."
Beautiful view of mountains,"Wonderful train journey which starts from coonoor to Ooty which covers a distance of 19 kms. It would approximately take 2.5-3 hrs to cover the entire distance. There are totally 4 times the train goes from ooty to foothills. You will get an mesmerizing view of mountains, tunnels and bridges.the tickets can be booked through irctc website as well."
Beautiful Blue Hills,Queen of Blue Hills is an awesome place to visit.The train journey is really a nice experience of the life.People say Nilgiris is also known as the Switzerland of India.
Unforgettable Trip From Ooty to Coonoor,"When I reached Ooty, the first thing I enquired was whether there is any possibility of getting ticket in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway's heritage train. Came to know that the bookings were full and would get ticket from counter if there is any luck. On the second day we reached the Ooty station 45 mins early and stood in the queue. Luckily we got tickets to Coonoor. The ticket charge was 35 INR. The train was full and the journey was really exciting. Now the heritage train is hauled by a meter gauge Diesel loco. Everybody visiting Ooty should try and enjoy the fun."
One of the VERY BEST TOY TRAIN rides !,A 100% must do experience while in Ooty region....One MUST do ONLINE BOOKING in advance ..at least 2 weeks early as otherwise might have to skip or miss the joyride..A 30 minute before the journey also can get u a unreserved ticket...A world of an experience..
Very average service,The views from the train are spectacular. But the service of the Nilgiris railways is worst.  Right from booking tickets at the counter to cleanliness of the train coach. They can upgrade the coaches atleast. So crampy seats.
"Memorable, mesmerising...",This is my second journey in the last two years. The journey itself was a thriller. Getting tickets is the first step. Always plan your journey early if you want to experience a beautiful journey. We could get first class tickets in the first journey while it was second class next time. Book the tickets through IRCTC. No tatkal too fir the 9 am train. Advice...you are lucky if you get a window on the far side of the train if you start from Ooty... The journey will give a mesmerising experience.. enjoy the beauty of nature...
Ooty trip with family,Please book the tickets earlier too avoid inconvenience the toy train journey is superb the view of the Nilgiri mountains is awesome do visit Ooty and enjoy Toy train
Must ride,When you are in Ooty never miss an opportunity to ride on this heritage train. We rode from Coonoor to Ooty stretch. Next to the station is stem locomotive repair shed. You are allowed to walk over and admire the steam locomotives there which are still used to push some of the train services from Coonoor to Ooty. Enjoy the views all around. We had booked first class and were lucky to get seats in the first compartment in front of the train. You can see the guard signalling the Engine driver who is pushing the train from behind all the coaches. The engine actally pushes the entire train uphill and each coach has a guard who is in charge of emergency brakes and signals the loco driver using red and green flags.One of the very few railway services in the world where a stem locomotive is still in use.
Beautiful,"There are couple of activities in ooty hill station,otherwise it's mess. Mountain train is the best activity in ooty. For ooty to Connor it's difficult to get tickets but one can choose ooty to petty. It's also good..but there is no difference in FC or 2nd class except no of passengers in a coach"
Amazing site in nature's lap,"The train passes through amazing part of Nilgiri mountains which has not seen much destruction by humans. Views all along the track are mesmerizing. At the same time, it is the most economical way to travel to Ooty. Only problem is you have to book the tickets well in advance."
Good one - kids enjoyed more,"Tough time for tickets so book in advance onlinePreferably book first class those with kidsWe dint get our tickets confirmed from ooty to coonoor even though we booked 1.5 months advanced , we stood in a quaue 2 hours before but no luck , so we reached coonoor by road and did return journey as we had those tickets . Getting tickets for return journey is easy . Kids enjoyed a lot .. not much views but some views are worth it loved the ride . Kids had awesome fun"
Complicated reservation? No need! ,"Rack railway operated by steam engine is definitely worth to visit. It is part of unesco heritage etc (read more on wikipidia :)The train is very popular tourist attraction, you should book the tickets in advace. They said. But try to handle the online booking system of Indian Railways. It is complicated and it gets even worse when you operate just with mobile phone (backpackers usually don’t carry laptops). We somehow managed to buy tickets one week in advance and then - at the time of the train, at the platform we have been told that our tickets are not valid - it said WL - waiting list. So the irctc basically sells you tickets and concrete seats but someone else bought the same seats before you. But you have another option- you just simply buy much cheaper ticket at the counter office at the railway station. It is unreserved seat. We took the train from Ooty to Mettupalayam but most people go just to Conoor so we had comfortable sitting by the window even though unreserved. There are beautiful views, mostly on right side (in Ooty-Mett direction). But the steam engine is super noisy. If you are considering to take the whole ride (Ooty-Mettupalayam) which takes like 4 hours, take ear plugs with you, I mean in, you’ll appreciate it.Prices: reserved 1st class - 420 rps/ unreserved 2nd class 75 rps"
Horrible NMR by Salem Division of Southern railway.,"IRCTC has disappointed my family today in Nilgiri Mountain Railway. I booked online for a group of 6 people in train no 06172(summer special). They have operated this service with old coaches, not with new coaches. We had booked tickets thinking that we will travel by new coach. Very bad experience today(26/05/19)."
Chill place,Me and my friends are went at ooty I'm summer vacation we enjoyed well. But crowd is more. Summer vacation best place.
Good but reserve in advance,It's a memorable experience but better to reserve in advance otherwise you have to scramble for seats. Also the return (unreserved) train we took was 30 minutes late and it was highly boring as by road the distance from coonoor to ooty is just 30 mins.
Must to experience,"Wonderful experience, need to book the tickets in advance. The most amazing journey is between Mettupalayam to Connor where the train goes through tunnels and bridges, through a highly green forest and train use an old steam engine to climb the hill. From Conoor to Ootty the journey is similar to any other train journey as the train use diesel engine. Usually tourist take the ride between Conoor to Ooty but the beauty lies b/w Mettupalayam to Conoor."
Best attraction at Ooty,This is the best attraction in Ooty especially if you have young children. We went in a long weekend hence was very crowded. I tried to book tickets on IRCTC but it kept me in waiting till the end. I went to the station stood in line for an hour and got the first class tickets. The ride is good with beautiful views . Try to book ticket in advance .
Memorable Journey,"Journey is very enjoyable and pleasant.train is very good but not spacious..dont take heavy laguage,on the way train stops at 6 places which are very beautiful scenic spots..reserve the tickets before 2 months or take offline tickets at metupalem platform"
Pride of Ooty,UNESCO world heritage site which is more than 100 years old gives pleasant experience to the travelers. Must visit.
Unforgettable ,"Your Ooty trip is incomplete without visiting Nilgiri Mountain Railway. Book your tickets in advance. From Udagmandalam to Coonoor, toy train is hauled by diesel engine and from Coonoor to Mettupalayam by heritage Steam engine. We took our  trip from Udagmandalam to Mettupalayam and enjoyed 5 hours ride full of scenic and mesmerising view of Nilgiris."
Nice experience,You can experience very scenic views all around. Over all it's nice experience.its a UNESCO World Heritage site
Memorable travel ( don’t expect too much),"Travelled from Ooty to Connor.  Sit on the Lt side of the train seats so that you can see the valley view, which is awesome, we usually won’t travel in that height and in forest, don’t expect to see the animals, don’t worry if won’t get 1 st class or 2 class tickets, which are not needed for 1 hour journey, try to get the tickets 2 hours before departure."
Worth your Time,The best thing in the beautiful city of Ooty is the train ride from Udagamandalam to Metupalayam. The winding route gives you the opportunity to explore the  beautiful mountains and the valleys on offer. The only problem is that the train is filled with people leaving very little space for free movement. The railways have to relook at seating and make it more attractive and this will be truly be a lifetime opportunity. At the moment this is being milked beyond  capacity to make profits. But no harm if a little profit is lost to ensure that the numbers keep increasing
Nilgiri mountain rail,An incredible experience. The 46 km mountain train journey was full of excitement. We reserved our seats four months ahead reached metupalyam at 4 am afterfresh up reached railway station. The train consits of four bogies with two reserved coaches. The train departed at 7 10 amThere is no toilet in the train. We were afraid about this. But the train stops at intermediate stations  for five to ten minutes.so any one csn use the toilets at stations neat and hygienic. This train uses the rack and pinion technology to climb the mountain. Traversing several tunnels and bridgesWe reached ooty by 12.05 PM. With cherished minds.
A Must Do - Great Experience ,"Took the NMR from Ooty to Coonoor and back. Booking advance will be almost must since there is a lot of demand for this. Also I would suggest to book first class with a little premium to enjoy this world heritage rail. On the way back, we had the good luck of sitting at the front and had great views of wildlife crossing tracks in front of the train as well gorgeous views of tunnels. At Coonoor, there is a loco shed that has working editions of NMR steam engines and can be viewed. The station master also has a replica of the engine for sale at INR 2000. Only little disappointing fact is the engine is a Diesel engine from and to Coonoor. Steam engines are used to Metupalayam from Coonoor."
loved it,"our driver suggested taking the train to the end of the line, and we loved it.It cost us all of .80 cents Canadian each and it was a hoot.  They put us in a private row, which was a little disappointing a first, as we wanted to be with the locals.  But in a way it was nice to be able to take pictures from either side of the train.  After few stops later and locals came on board.  They were quite reserved, till one of the guys hung himself halfway out of the train car to take a selfie.  I took a picture of him doing that, and then laughed and showed them the picture and that broke the ice.  The scenery is wonderful and it is cool riding the narrow gauge train, or toy train as they call it.  For .80 cents you can't go wrong.  Our driver was there at the end and drove us back to the hotel.  Awesome."
Very nice train,This train is awesome. You need to buy ticket in advance from irctc page the station code is UAM TO ONR.  station in ooty is next to main market and bus station. Station is very clean. For quick ticket you need to stand in queue.  The view from train is very nice it goes by lots of tunnel and with lots of fellow passengers experience is awesome. A must visit in ooty.
Clean and beautiful ,"Very well maintained, good order in serving the guests. Had n Amaizing ride it was a fulfilling experience, a must visit place."
Amazing and Mesmerising Toy Train Ride!!!!,"We booked train from Mettupalayam to OOty and was once in a lifetime experience. A memorable journey and steam engine stopped at all stations for water/break and decent photo time. Bridges, Mountains and tea gardens were are there between Mettupalayam and Conoor. After Conoor engine changed to diesel  and train did not stop at any stations and journey was ok. Best was from Mettupalaym to Conoor in morning time and was very beautiful one. Book early as First class seats are booked very fast. Also engine pushes from behind and First Class coaches in Front with breathing taking almost 360 degree views. Also best seats are FS 5,6,7,8 if lucky as we were ...:))"
Amazed,Very nice and memorable journey on toy train from Ooty to coonor.the train moves slowly and we can enjoy the amazing landscape of the valley.very beautiful scenery around.
A bit of Adventure,This is an interesting toy train that us UN Heritage Listed. Only 3 carriages. Part of our carriage was first class. Best eats are on left side again the window and looking in the direction of travel. We travel once way being uphill to Ooty. Nice views also of the tea estates. Plenty of stops on the way to get out and go to toilets. Our train was full.
Great Ride on the Toy Train,We were not able to get the tickets we wanted for taking the train but came to Ooty anyways. We walked in the train station on a Sunday and were able to do the special ride they have for tourists on Sunday afternoons that we hadn't known of!We rode the train down to the Ketti station and disembarked. We walked around and then had a samosa and tomato soup that was included with your train ticket. After about 20 minutes we got back on the train and enjoyed the views as we returned to Ooty.
Great journey,This has to be a must visit if you are in the area. Fantastic views all round. we did the downward journey and found it fascinating. You can do no other than marvel at the engineering that went into the construction
Vintage experience!!! ,We travelled from Ooty to Coonoor in this train and it was a totally different experience. The views were good on both the sides and the experience was nice. One can experience the smell eucalyptus with eucalyptus trees around. Kids had a lot of fun and also had a great time. Must visit for the ones visiting ooty.
Not a toy train!,"A a few weeks ago, 24SEP2019, I found myself faced with enjoying another one of the five Indian mountain railways, this one further South in Kerala state. Though not a toy train m, it was still a mountain railway—very slow, with the locomotive a genuine steam unit which needed clean fresh w as well as a source to heat the water. The historic engine was fired up and ran the lowest section of this track, rePlaced by a diesel-burning unit for the upper stretches."
Toy train throughthe hills,We travelled on the diesel part of track which takes an hour. Beautiful scenery and a real adventure! We booked our seats which is advisable. Leg room very poor so long legged folk feel very uncomfortable! The steam part down to the plains takes 3 hours I believe and the train is pretty unreliable. We are told scenery no better sojust did the trip from Ooty downwards.
Nilgiri mountain railways,I travelled for the first time in nilgiri mountain railways and had a wonderful once in a lifetime experience traveling in it I had booked first class bogie tickets which has 16 comfortable seats and it has separate coach for online booking and counter booking so it was convenient for me to just go and board the train online booking has 16 seats quota for first class and second class sitting has 4 coaches. Journey has breathkaing views of the valleys and train stops on the way at few stations and Connor is also one of them where it halts for 15mins from them on its the rack and pinnion technology till METUPALAIYAM and anyone visiting ooty should take a train ride while returning back from ooty and book a flight or train from coimbatore as coimbatore is just 40kms from mettupalyam and its easy to get cab and there is a parking lot where rates are mentioned and we can bargain and book a cab and comfortably reach coimbatore airport or railway station. I paid 1200/-INR for drop off till coimbatore Airport for cab and was fully satisfied with the trip and was very impressed by the nilgiri mountain railways and its brilliant route through forest and olden day's bridges and tunnels. I would recommend that anyone should take this route while returning back from ooty as its convenient and once in a lifetime experience.
Road is better!,"If u have already experienced a mountain railway, this is no exception. Once u chug out of Coonoor, there are some superior views but marred by houses and garbage... We need to look at securing the Nilgiris heritage trail...Too long to reach Ooty if ur in a hurry. Lovedale is a quaint station. Weather will add to the experience. Road travel offers better view of the valleys on a clear day. Take the ride once if u have never been on a toy train."
Scenic journey along the verdant landscape,"A beautiful train journey along the picturesque lush green landscape and cloud kissed mountain tops. UNESCO has added NMR as as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The site becomes known as Mountain Railways of India.It is an exceptional journey starts from Mettupalyam and ends at Udhagamandalam covering 12 stations. Coonoor is the main intermediate station, sited near the locomotive workshops as well as the top end of the rack rail.How to do reservation -The train will have two first class carriages and one second class carriage. The adult train fare is 30 rupees ($0.45) in second class and 205 rupees ($3) in first class, one way.Reservations for travel on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway can be made at Indian Railways computerized reservation counters or on the Indian Railways website."
Fantastic Train and Scenery,"We travelled in both directions between Mettupalayam and Ooty. The journey was just wonderful; the railway itself is great, the views and scenery are superb. It’s worth booking a First Class reserved seat, preferably number 1 - 8 so you’re in the end compartment at the front of the train on the way up (great outlook because the locos are pushing from the back) and at the very back on the way down when the locos are pulling from the front!"
Memorable Trip,The Nilgiris mountain train journey is truly memorable. A must for all people who visit Ooty. its really enjoy
Lifetime's ambition fulfilled,"The question is not whether it is worthwhile taking a trip on the NMR, but whether you'll be able to secure a reservation. We eventually obtained excellent seats, but when we first went online two months prior to departure, we were unable to book a seat.In one sense, the railway is ridiculous; it takes nearly five hours to reach Ooty, just 26 miles (43 kilometres)  from Mettupalayam, while the same trip can be completed via the twisty road in just an hour and a half. If you don't understand the magic of the train, there is probably little I can say to convince you.The next ridiculous thing about it is the timetable; while tourists come from far and wide, and like us, scramble for a ticket, there is only one train a day each way, and it leaves at Mettupalayam at seven in the morning, or as soon thereafter as can be contrived. This means that unless you are a local, you'll need to find somewhere to stay; we put up at the Black Thunder Resort, which was fine, but in no way close enough to walk to the station; you'll probably need a car, and if you have one, then send your driver ahead with the luggage/baggage; the advantage of this is you'll not need to try to attempt to stow your bags on the train, where space is at a premium.The line loses money, and that is probably why there are so few trains — if more were added then it would lose even more, yet as it is (part of) a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it cannot be closed, and recently, new locomotives have been purchased. Given its special status and the large staff available, it is a pity the windows are not cleaned enough for people who have travelled thousands of miles to get there to at least see out. In practice, the Windows were soon opened, and we could see the landscape clearly.For a while, the train trundles along on the flat in a more-or-less straight line, and just as you are beginning to think ""Well isn't this boring?"", after a halt to take on water, the locomotive engages with the rack, and the train begins to climb steeply; at every thrust of the piston, you feel a little push in the back.From now one, the track is seldom straight and never flat. There are frightening views down into deep valleys, with many bridges and viaducts, and several tunnels in which, by some convention, all the children scream.The locomotive is at the back for safety reasons, to prevent unhooked carriages from hurtling downhill, out of control. The train is ""controlled"" by one or more guards sitting on a veranda at the front, who show red or green flags to the engine driver/engineer.The train stops at stations redolent of empire, like Hilgrove, Wellington and Lovedale, to take on water; each time, everyone piles out to photograph the loco, each other, the landscape &c. You will be warned there are no toilets on board the train. While this is true, there are ""facilities"" (of sorts) at each stop.Coonoor is the end of the rack and pinion section; the steam engine is replaced by a soulless diesel, and things are never quite the same again, until the train pulls into Ooty/Udhagamandalam, where passengers are already queuing up for the journey back down the mountain.I have also travelled on the Kalka-Shimla line, which is twice as long, but not nearly so satisfying."
Long and Sweet Journey in NMR train,Nilgiri Mountain Railway which was established by British in India has now been successfully for 100+ years. This stretch of railway was built in the middle of a dense mountain jungle. Lots of improvement were made with respect to facility in intermediate stations. One of the engineering marvel to be admired.
A must do!,"We only took the diesel train from Ooty to Coonoor, but a lovely hour's run and great views in an olde worlde first class carriage. Would love to take the full 4 hours next time."
Must go place ,"If you are one who loves to sit and stare at the nature then this is a place. You have to be o book your tickets well before if you planed for the train ride. Else you can visit the train museums, get some nice photo shots and leave"
A Serpentile treat amongst the cloud kissed mountains of the Nilgiris,"'Hold my hands love and I shall take you aloft the clouds and show you the world below'. My wife enjoyed the slow,chug chug of the train ride from Mettupalyam to Ooty on a day when the air around us smelt of eucalyptus, eating chilly bhaji and sipping masala tea. Wow is not just the word but feeling is believing. Enjoy the ride lest you repent later."
Beautiful Scenic Journey,We boarded the Nilgiri Mountain Railway from Wellingdon to Ooty and found ourselves a place to sit. The journey was very scenic and beautiful.
Must Visit ,"While visiting the Ooty, this train journey should be included in the itinerary. Clean coaches, good crowd management, excellent view makes this train journey memorable . One must visit this engineering marvel."
Kind of good...,Well for first timers it's something like must go.. Train is bit small and windows are not that big.. It's one hour journey from ooty.. After getting down u can definitely take some pics in different style...
Arriving at 4am was futile,Decided to give the general class a go. Arrived at 4am on the dot and there was already a massive line. My guess is 45-55. No idea what other travelers have been talking about as this is the second day in a row we've tried to get general seating tickets (Wednesday & Thursday). I thought March/April was there peak season. Hopefully this helps other travelers decide on which tickets to buy in the January period.
Fabulous Experience,"We took a ride from Coonoor to Ooty and it was a wonderful experience. Small neat and tidy stations, narrow gauge railway, small compartments, travel through lush green Nilgiri Forest is really enjoyable. We get tickets before the journey. So, need to be there at least 45min early. Everyone wants to have this experience, so there is a big queue for tickets."
Quaint,"I traveled from Ooty to Coonoor in main carriage, I couldn't see much difference in first class except maybe no line up but that was part of the fun. Well organised, small gauge ""toy"" train, scenery was so picturesque! Mountain views, tea plantations, cute station stops... and so many gum trees felt like home. Apparently the seeds were brought to India over 200 years ago."
Miun tain railway,Enjoy with mountain raillway. All view very excellent. The good career for mountain raillway very nice
Enjoyable Train Journey From ooty To Coonoor and back.,"Nice journey from ooty to coonoor. Had to book an hour in advance. Had a comfortable journey in 1st class. But The booking system is horrible. They dont let you book return tickets. The return journey was pathetic. No 1st class compartment in the train, so had to sit in a general compartment. Was tough as we had a senior citizen with us. They should have some arrangements for senior citizens travelling."
Great morning out,Being from Australia and loving beautiful scenery this railway is a must do for travellers for sure.The countryside is just beautiful and the train is rickety and fun. Travelling from Ooty to Connor was a great experience.A must do to see this beautiful place.
lovely experience,it had been one of the best experiences in ooty. the ride had been a very good economical one with comfortable seats and magnificent views. this is definitely a must-watch for people who visit ooty.
Excellent journey through the midst of natural beauty,Excellent journey between the nature. Had taken the first class ticket and that ensured hardly any trouble for the seats but overall it looked good. Coaches are perfectly clean and well maintained for their age. Entire journey  being extremely close to historical rock cuts and natural colourful flowers was an experience. The tall trees and the deep valleys are mesmerizing.
One for your bucket list,"Written about, filmed & made into documentaries. One of the world’s  must do train journeys. Astonishing feat of engineering with amazing tunnels hewn through rocks; bridges without sides across chasms and old narrow carriages. Very romantic. The journey end to end is 3.5 hours but you can do the Ooty to Coonoor but in 1 hour although this is by diesel rather than steam train. Alternatively Coonoor to the end of the line at Mettupalayam. Need to book seats by the windows to get views and photos. Best side is on right of train when descending and left if going up. Seats to book are in FS1 carriage numbers 1 & 9 for forward facing and 5 & 13 for rear facing. On the Coonoor to Mettupalayam section you may get some soot from the engine on your clothes."
No tickets,"We reached at 1 for train at 4 from Coonoor to Ooty as chances of getting tickets on same day in this route is higher than Ooty to Coonoor. We were advised to come back at 2 and that turned out to be a mistake. By that time there were approx. 35-40 ppl ahead in the queue. The ticket window opens at 3:40 PM (note there's another queue for another location and the train leaves at 3:30 - do not stand in that queue). Each person took 3-4 tickets and the 110 tickets were exhausted much before our turn. The window then reopens for standing in the train with 15 additional tickets and that too were exhausted before our turn. All in all we wasted 2 hrs with no luck. The one star is because of poor administration. There should be a way to let people know if they would get a ticket at all or there should be some token system etc. But who cares in government setups about efficiencies. We did see one person with wait listed ticket being confirmed on the spot - so booking online may have a glimmer of hope, even with WL. The only good thing - no touts or shady deals."
Different experience,"We booked tickets through IRCTC in second class before 2 months. The train had 1 First class coach, 1 second class coach, 1 Reserve coach & 3 General coach (unreserved). FS & 2S had 4 seats facing another 4 seats and the other two had 2 seaters like in bus. The beauty of ride is that the train goes slow & one could just get dumbstruck by the scenic view of the valley. We could see it even when we go by car but that isn't comparable to the train ride as the train's track is built on the edge of the mountain & when you just look down butterflies would swim around your stomach due to its steepness. From Ooty we got into 9.15am train to Conoor and came back to Ooty by 4pm train. So by this we got to see Conoor also. The chill air on the face, smell of the trees, the train's whistle, tunnels & beautiful view of the mountains & valleys could be experienced only if you ride by this toy train. If you have kids please do not miss it. P.S - From Ooty to Conoor sit by your right to enjoy the view and while returning sit by your left. But if u reserve by IRCTC one cannot assure which side you would get as the tickets are numbered. But if you stand in queue and buy tickets in the counter directly you can choose to sit wherever you want to in the general coach. But don't forget you should come before an hour to stand in the queue to get your tickets and again you need to stand in queue to sit on general coach."
Really terrible.,Accordingly to the reviews I booked the best seat on the highest cost but can't find any difference between first class and others.Views were also not that mind-blowing.One can skip this.
Kids enjoyed ,Kids and all of our family members enjoyed this Trip.Wonderful lifetime experience in this Toy train.
An experience of a Lfetime,"The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a UNESCO Certified world heritage site that starts from Mettupalayam to Udhagamadalam. It is one of the 2 places in India where the train is functional using a steam powered locomotive.It is an amazing experience to go on a ride in this iconic train through the forest, rivers, tunnels and beautiful bridges."
The Toy Train but it’s ain’t a toy,It’s called the toy train but it’s a piece of history a piece of heritage. It’s a steam engine small train but shows the best views in its 1 to 3.5 hour journey through Conoor of The Nilgiris and Ooty. Some famous songs of Bollywood has been shot on its tracks and the most famous on the roof of this toy train.I have seen another toy train also having UNESCO HERITAGE stamp in Darjeeling.One can take a 1 hour ride to and from Ooty to Conoor or a 3.5 hour ride to and from Ooty to Mettupalayam.The tickets r very difficult to get especially the first class reserved compartments so book in advance.
Nilgiri mountain railway,"The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is a 1,000 mm  metre gauge railway in Tamil Nadu, India, built by the British in 1908. The railway is operated by the Southern Railway and is the only rack railway in India."
Nilgiri Mountain Railway,"The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway in Tamil Nadu, India, built by the British in 1908.[1] The railway is operated by the Southern Railway[2] and is the only rack railway in India. It is one of a best experience that I or anyone would like to have."
Best thing to do in Ooty,"The narrow gauge railway line is from Mettupalayam(About 40 Kms from Coimbatore City) to Ooty. It is a Long journey and only one train during the day. Better to take from Ooty to Coonoor or from Coonoor to Ooty, which have more trains daily. It is one hour ride. It is better to book Tickets in advance on official website of Indian Railways known as  irctc , to avoid last minute disappointment.You can buy tickets on the spot, for that just reach station at least 2 hours before departure time. but will have to stand in queue for long time, specially during tourist season. At 3:00 pm you can watch the steam engine(Between Coonoor and Mettupalayam) taking the train downhill at Coonor station. It is one of the steepest climb for trains. The steam engine has a special cogs to fit on the teeth made in the center of the track so that the wheels do not slip, only between Metupalayam to Coonoor. Diesel engine plies the train between Coonoor and Ooty. The ride has beautiful views and small toy like stations en-route."
Enjoyable but difficult to get tickets,"As of now railway is running 3 trains from Ooty to Koonur and vice versa. You can enjoy awesome view and enjoy the journey. But to get tickets is real pain. Advance booking is advisable, else you have to wait in queue for 2 hrs in unorganized way."
Wonderful experience,"Had wonderful toy train ride with my family. My father had this dream to ride toy train since the time he watched movie ""aradhana"". He was so so happy when i gave this ride as a surprise. Book train tickets from irctc in advance to avoid hassle later. Cheers!!"
Beautiful Nilgiri Toy Train,"Nilgiri Mountain Railway is best in India. We prefer journey from ooty to METUPALAIYAM to save time as the upside journey takes more time. We booked in 1st class cabin but don't expect AC. book well in advance to be lucky to ride. Nicely built wooden cabin but poor maintenance caused some uncomfortable.Always select rights window while coming down from ooty. No good food is available on the way or stop over station. You can only have some coffee /tea and chips. And finally the journey itself.. It's heavenly experience...full of flowers, fauna trees tea gardens huge mountains water falls sun set.. Old tunnel of British era Railway Bridge awesome. Sorry I could not give you better photos than this as my SLR camera was not working. Go and enjoy... Oh..while riding wait for the whistle of steam engine."
"Awesome journey, scenic beauty","We took a journey from coonoor to ooty. It took around 1 hour. Ticket fare is 35 for second class and 200 for first class. First class tickets can be booked online. Second class tickets opened two hours before the train's departure and can be availed only through ticket window. If you don't get the ticket, wait till the train's arrival. They are opening the window once again for standing ticket at the time of train's arrival to the station.About journey,It was one of its kind. The train will pass through the eucalyptus trees. The view of Ketti valley is memorable. Its a heritage train so the train management done by the railways is also quite unique which we don't observe in the  normal trains."
 Average train with average views,The hype around this train and the difficulty in getting the tickets are much more as compared to the pleasure one gets by riding it.  First class tickets were booked already and second class sitting was quite congested. No toilets or reshreshment on the way.
The Highlight Of Any Trip To Coonoor/Ooty,"This train trip is a lot of fun and offers spectacular scenery and views. The landscape is varied and picturesque - rocky terrain, rivers and ravines, tea plantations and many green hills.  There are tunnels and bridges and plenty of curves too.For a truly authentic experience join the locals and get your take-away idli for the journey. In summer go early to avoid the crowds."
Breathtaking Beautiful Scenery,It's a most beautiful scenery you get to during this TripThis experience transports you higher Levels of Joy
Charming choo choo train,"A must-do in Ooty. You can read other reviews for the charm factor. I’m no expert but here’s the facts:  Ooty - Conoor is the fast trip (1 hour), which gives you all the views without using up the whole day. There are three trains a day on this route. 9.15am, 12.30pm, and the last at 5.30pm. I don’t have times for the return trains from Conoor. Cost only 35 rupees single. Unless you’ve reserved weeks and months before, and if you’re reading this, it’s probably too late for that, you can only buy tickets on the day. I tried to buy the day before - not possible. Ticket office told me to get there early, i.e 7am to queue to buy a ticket when ticket office opens at 8am, for the 9.15 train, he said queues can get long.  You can’t buy a return, so assume you would have to queue again if you want to do the same trip return. I arrived at station at 5.15pm, no queues and took the last train. Loads of seats - bear in mind the sun is setting, and the last 20 minutes or so (in winter) is more or less dark. Sunlight probably best on the morning train for photos. Take seats on the carriage side away from platform in Ooty (for best photos). Got a bus back from Conoor to Ooty - no waiting, 20 rupees... whole round trip 2 hours.  A great excursion for 55 rupees. Train has around 7 - 8 carriages, 64 seats per carriage - 2 of these carriages are for people who’ve bought reserved tickets in advance."
Number One on my Bucket list,The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was built by my Grandfather Walter Moir in the late 1890s. He was the chief engineer and was responsible for all the amazing bridges and tunnels. He also commissioned the Swiss engines to replace the original British ones which lacked power. All my life I have heard about the railway from my Mother who was born and raised in Coonoor. She went to England after Indian Independence but her love for the Nilgiris and the railway never faltered.So to ride on the railway was a very special experience and one I shall never forget.
A ride that you must not miss,The railway is one of the heritage sites. The make of the train resembles that of a toy train. Traveling in this train reminded me of my childhood albeit traveling with adults onboard in a train which is smaller than the regular trains. The route taken by the train from Ooty to Conoor is very scenic overseeing the mountains and valley and a couple of tunnels too. The cool breeze refreshes your soul. Couples are seen doing photo shoots alongwith props at the stations enroute when the train arrives.
Wonderful Journey,"At least once Nilgiri Mountain Railway must be experienced.  It is an amazing and thrilling experience travelling in this train.  The vintage Engine and coaches are maintained at working condition.  There will be guard for each coach, I believe who has control of breaks.  We travelled in first class.  The lady TTE Madam was singing songs is a bonus in our travel.  In coonoor we can witness the change of engine, which is worth watching the process. The beauty around the mountain is feast for eyes.  Experience in tunnels is enjoyable. The first class cabin is very nice and specious. It is better to book in advance through IRCTC for getting tickets in first and second class reserved coaches.  Because there well be queue for general class tickets."
Scenic beauty on historical steam engine,"It is definitely a 'must' trip to take when you plan to visit this Hill Station Ooty, the experience is awesome and the feeling is nostalgic since you will be going on an old but very reliable and proven steam engine machine (only if you take the Metupalyam - Conoor section). Booking tickets will be a struggle but there are around 40 unreserved seats whixh you can get hold if all reservations are not available /full. To get hold of unreserved ticket(s) max of 4 per head, you should try to reach the counter by 6/6:30 morning on the travel date.  Ticket counter opens at 8am in the morning. Rainy seasons will be a challenged as the age old train will not be able to withstand heavy ones (windows and couple of drops from roof) but hey! that also is an experience which you won't get easily now in this generation...while going down,  right side has more downward sceneries but left side do have some beautiful views of waterfalls falling from literally from the sky down all the way across the train.. and down... Don't worry about rest rooms as you can go to any one of the stations which it will stop on its way.. So enjoy the ride..."
Good but overhyped,"Ooty to Coonoor by train is nice train journey. But it’s lot more overhyped compared to real experience. It’s hard to get tickets. One needs to stand in queue at least an hour or more on weekends. They issue more tickets and people would be standing all around in the train. It gets crowded.  Trains moves much faster than what’s written in many reviews. You see lot of dirt and plastic waste on the way.  But not worth the effort you put in getting tickets..Overall, it’s one of the things to do in Ooty. May be if you can book first or second class ticket about 2 months in advance, it may give better experience."
Amazing ride,"Fantastic experience, breath taking view from Ooty to Coonoor. Both 1st class and 2nd class tickets are available, but need to wait in queue for 1.5 hrs to get the ticket."
Toy train,"Good trip with beautiful views in a toy kind of train. It runs thru valleys mountains and tunnels. You may reserve tickets thru irctc to avoid standing in queue at station, however it is very well maintained for the people to have tickets at station and get into train directly"
serene and joyful,"I loved the experience of Nilgiri Mountain rail. You should try 1st class, the seats are better and try to take the right hand seats. Right side provides some good scenery. Good for your eyes to see such greenery after staring at our computers all life long."
A lovely picturesque train with views,"35Rs from Ooty to Coonoor. Incredible value. The last train back to Ooty was half an hour earlier than I had been told, so do check. I got the one before and for my 35Rs I had a carriage to myself. Certainly take the time to do this if you have not time for the full trip from Mettapulam."
Dream come true,"As part of an organised tour from UK, my brother and I joined the iconic steam journey by 'Toy Train' at Coonor to travel in vintage style through the beautiful Nilgiris.We were especially interested to make this unforgettable trip as our late father had been born in this area, living as a young boy in Aruvankadu and attending school in Wellington.I well recall the tales he told me of his time spent there and his fond memories of Souther India.We were excited to pass right by the stations of Aruvankadu and Wellington and managed to take photos of both signs.We also saw the cordite factory where our grandfather worked and which exists to this day.The memory of this very special sweet train ride is in my memory forever."
A must do,"We rode the train from Coonoor to Ooty. It's a great way to get a view of the countryside and the colourful villages along the way. Our journey to about an hour and twenty minutes, I think it's scheduled faster than that. Carriages are fairly comfortable.  We were prebooked as part of a tour so no problems getting a seat."
The Heritage Railway,The Nilgiri Mountain Railway declared as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2005. The starting point of this Railtrack is Udgamandalam (Ooty). If you wish to enjoy the scenic train ride book tickets through IRCTC in advance. The train ride is one of a kind. You can enjoy the alpine forest and tea plantation along the tracks. There are several tunnels which give this train journey another twist.
Exiting Journey!,"This steam engine train that runs from Mettupalayam to Ooty and back, stopping at hill stations such as Coonoor, Wellington, Lovedale and Ketty enroute it’s a slow-motion, toy-sized version of a train journey against hilly, lush movie set backdrops and across bridges strung at daredevil altitudes. It evokes nostalgia for the 19th century, for those old songs from black-and-white films that had steam engines in them. It takes around five hours to reach Ooty from Mettupalayam, wherein you cross the verdant greens of Coonoor, Kallar, Adderley, Hill Grove, Runnymede, Kateri, Wellington, Aruvankadul, Ketti and Lovedale with around 13 tunnels along the stretch."
Toy train to Coonor,"Excellent view, the railway staff and the local police guide the passengers to form  a queue and direct them to the coaches."
Something Different,Toy Train operating as Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a must have experience for anyone who has not done it before. Journey takes around 1 hour and train operates four times in a day between Ooty and Conoor.Tickets are priced at Rs 10 (General)and Rs 100 (for first class) but getting them is a big challenge. General tickets are sold over the counter and cannot be purchased in advance. Railways security does a very good job in ensuring everyone sits in designated boogies. Must Try.
Its Good but not Breathtaking or out of this world - Just a pleasant train journey,"Took the Ride from udagamandalam to C0onoor. Please note that they wont give you a steam engine but a locomotive engine (As this is considered a  passenger train and NOT a toy train ) , so set your expectation accordingly . They wont stop in station for more than 1-2 minutes unless lot of passengers are getting boarded or deboarded. so practically have not much option of taking photos while getting off at station.  I traveled in First Class and found the glasses are extremely dirty and hazy which really prevents you to enjoy the outside view properly , specially if you are not sitting at the window seat. The valley view are okay but nothing breathtaking , almost same normal view that you will get from a car trip on hill road side. May be the steam engine would have added some extra charm in it , but we missed it . Overall an experience you should try for its history , but dont expect too much if you are traveling from ooty to coonoor."
A Must to do when in Ooty,"A one of its kind experience if you have never travelled through Toy Trains. If you would like to experience the steam engine in the train then travel from Mettupalayam to Ooty or vice versa, which is a 4-5 hr journey & they have steam engine till it from Coonor. Overall good fun but it is advisable to book your tickets through IRCTC as they one First Class & one Normal class reserved coach. Else one will have to reach early and stand in a queue to get the tickets. Also these general coach seats are not very comfortable."
"Great Railway, Great views","Was told to get there by 11am to get tickets for noon train. They were correct. Station staff organised a queue system on platform. Train arrives and station staff direct awaiting passengers onto the train compartments.Views excellent and so cheap, 10 rupees each. Be warned though, book return trip in advance to ensure return on same train, otherwise a few hours wait."
Route full of natural beauty..,Nilgiri mountain railway or the toy train takes u from Ooty to coonoor. The route is of 1.15 hours but the excellent natural scenes we can witness amongst this route. Must visit activity
Overrated Train Journey,Probably it was because we saw a lot of much more beautiful places in Coonoor and near by Ooty that we did not enjoy the views offered during this journey from Coonoor to Ooty or probably we chose the wrong one and should have chosen Mettupalayam to Coonoor.It was nothing like breathtaking or out of the world.
Not so interesting,"The railway trip actually was just ok, because the trip get boring just after couple of kilometers, all of my family members was getting sleepy."
Amazing experience,Tried to book the toy train tickets in advance via irctc but nothing got confirmed after charting was done(Actually  booked First Class tickets and then tatkal Second class both ended up in waiting list). Thought of trying our luck in  Mettupalayam station and on the day of journey multiple reserved FC ticket seats were empty. People didn’t show up so TC allotted us FC seats by paying the ticket price. Amazing valley views and it took almost 5 hours from Mettupalayam to Ooty. Overall happy to get the tickets and completed the trip as we really want to have toy train experience.Attached few pics
Nothing extraordinary,"It's a nice can have experience. Takes one hour from ooty to cornoor. The queue is very well maintained by the police. So if you reach a little early, get your ticket and sit in the queue you can be assured to have a nice and enjoyable one hour.Please note that the seats are quite small to accommodate two bulky people. Seats towards are right side have a better view."
One of the most memorable experiences - Ooty Mini train ,"Had heard a lot about this Ooty to Coonoor train service beforehand, and so had booked tickets from before through IRCTC. Was never disappointed, a truly serene train ride cutting through mountains and hills tunnels amidst picturesque landscape on both sides. The trip was only 1.25 hrs long, so hoped it lasted a bit more.Would recommend everyone should avail this ride as a part of Ooty sightseeing itinerary."
Amazing experience to travel inside forest in a toy train,Please plan and book in advance for the travel from IRCTC. Getting tickets will be tougher. So plan in advance. The drive will take 4.5 hrs to Ooty. The train will take you to places where you have not visited so far in the forest. Must try.
Amezing view of jungle and mountains,"It's one hour journey from Ooty to coonor or vice versa. Time table I'd displayed at station and ticket distribution start 45 minutes before departure of train.First class seat limited to 16 and will cost you 100 per seat. Around 300 Second class seats are also available. You can get travle from Ooty to Connor and ask your driver to pick you up from destination station. You can also hire car from outside of coonor station. From Ooty I have traveled by 5:30 pm train and got ticket 4:50, evening time you can see beautiful fog in tree and valleys."
Beautiful experience ,It was an amazing experience traveling in the Nilgiri rail. Lush green mountains and in between u traveling in rail. The cold breeze makes you rejoice.
Great experience,This was the highlight of my trip - truly a grand experience and allows you to take in the countryside as one rises in altitude. Next time I will take this coming down as well. The windy road by car was nauseating.
A 'Fun'tastic experience !!!! :),"It was a surprisingly awesome trip in this hill train from Mettupalayam (about 38 KM from Coimbatore) to Ooty, the popular hill station in Tamilnadu. Normally by car or bus it takes just 3 to 3.5 hrs to reach Ooty from Coimbatore. But this hill train takes 4.5 hours and stops for 10 minutes in stations in between that enables us to get down, enjoy and take click snaps of the lovely scenic natural beauty around and you feel really fun filled and rejuvinated at the end of the journey! It passes via tunnels, streams, bridges, ridges, with colourful flowers inviting you on both sides. You realise at the end that a  journey is not only  goal oriented but also process oriented! You can book for this train as a connect through Nilgiri express train from Chennai to Coimbatore or you can book from Coimbatore to Ooty or from Mettupalayam to Ooty. Nilgiri express from Chennai through Coimbatore stops at Mettupalayam and we have to change over to this cute little hill train. We can also go by car upto Mettupalayam and take this train.. The train starts by 7.25 AM and reaches Ooty (Also called as Udhagamandalam in Tamil) by 12 noon. Again starts back by 2 PM and returns to Mettupalayam by 6.30 PM  so as to connect to Nilgiri express starting from Mettupalayam by 7.30 PM to Chennai via Coimbatore. A word of caution, please check the running status of the train, as the train is not operated if there are land slides especially on rainy seasons and also better to get confirmed tickets in advance as limited seats are available.  The rush is heavy on weekends and holidays. A must see and enjoy for every one."
A very beautiful way to travel to ooty.,This is must if you visit Ooty. We took train from Ooty to Connor. One hour journey ( only RS 10) but you have to book in advance (3 hours before starting) otherwise close to operating hour you may not get the ticket or not a seat. There is beautiful view of valley and you enjoy the scenic Ooty in the large windows with many photo options. You can come out of train though ( unlike other toy trains) till you reach Connor.
Train journey from wellington to Ooty.,a wonderful journey amidst the picturesque Nilgiri specially the Wellington area and don't miss to get down at Wellington station to take a stroll.
Railway,it is a railway station. here you can enjoy the view of the place while journey in train. Beautiful attraction available
Toy train ride in Southern India ... MUST VISIT enjoyed by @GhumnatuBaba,"These heritage train tracks are big hit in Europe and other western countries. In India these have been there only in few places like Shimla, Darjeeling, Ooty and Matheran.This Nilgiri Mountain Railway is UNESCO World Heritage Site and built in 1908. This track is meter gauge is UDAGAMANDALAM [Ooty] - Coonoor - METUPALAIYAM and run by steam locomotives.The ride can be booked thru irctc in advance. However it can be booked over the window if not done online. But online booking will save time and will confirm your ride.The train offers First Class at 150 INR and Second seating at 25 INR thru irctc website. First class should be preferred as Second seating will have more regular travelers than tourists.The downhill full journey takes 3:30 hours or you can enjoy Ooty - Coonoor which is roughly an hour ride. The full uphill journey takes 5 hours.In case you have few hours to spare then go to Lovedale which is just few kms from Ooty and enjoy the natural beauty away from the crowd of ooty. I drove to Lovedale and spent few hours at Lovedale station and enjoyed the time with my family.In case you found this review helpful do Vote/like it.Thanks@GhumantuBaba"
Reliving childhood trips,The ride on the Nilgiri Mountain Train was a source of great anticipation for over a dozen ladies celebrating over 50 years of friendship!The train ride was long enough to keep us enthralled and the changing landscapes were reminders of other rides to hill stations in the past.The train was well maintained and clean. The only downside was trying to fit six people per bench. It was impossible!
The most remarkable ride in South India! Definitely a must-do!!,"Nilgiri Mountain Railway is an amazing heritage ride preserved & maintained by the South Indian Railways since 1897! And this attraction truly depicts the grandeur of bygone era. The slow moving heritage steam engine train is definitely a bliss-on-wheels and this ride will be etched in my memory for a very long time.So, it’s a 1000 mm Meter Gauge which was started by British at the very Beginn of 19th century. A UNESCO world heritage site, the Nilgiris Mountain Railway is the only Rack Track that exists in India today. Udhagamandalam(Ooty), Coonoor, and Mettupalayam are the major stations covered on this route. Time table, fares, and reservation details can be found on the IRCTC Website. However, general ticket can be purchased from the ticket counter at the station itself! All you need to do is reach the station 1 hour in advance from the train departure time. If I could, I would give this activity more than 5 stars!A moving steam locomotive makes for such a pleasant sight to behold..."
"Wow, beautiful experience",Was an amazing but long train ride..you get to see the greenery throughout the 3-hour ride. I would recommend a shorter train ride from Mettupalayam to Coonoor. I visited OOTY way back in August 2006.
A live size toy train,enjoyed like a kid playing with his first toy train. The serene surroundings & breathtaking scenes made it sure that we lost track of time n completely immersed in the journey.
OOTY - will change the name to Honeymoon,"Unique place for new married couples. Visited with family and enjoy the Trip, One of the best place in my life"
Meh!,We took the train from Coonoor to Ooty.. and boy was it a loooooong trip. There was nothing much to see ..the bay was cramped with 10 people in each bay. Only the people near the window could see outside..all the rest had a difficult time trying to see what was out there. 20 mins into the ride we were all sooo sleepy and could barely keep our eyes open..Maybe if we had boarded from Mettupalayam it would have been better. And I recommend booking a ticket in advance cause the queue was super long.
Good landscape but very bad organization of Indian railway company,"The organization is terrible. Only 4 out of 10 people in our wagon were correctly seated in the seats we had reserved. We asked someone of the staff and they didnt tell us what to do correctly. Classic Indian organization. The landscape is awesome, it is worth traveling at least from Mettupalayam to Coonoor. We got off the train in Coonoor because it took us to run 24 kms around 3 hours. The train has several stops where you can get off, take pictures and stretch your legs for a while because the train is very uncomfortable. A good experience if you are around, but if you miss visiting it, it will not be a great deal."
Nice experience,A very good experience and train journey is awesome. It will go all around the Nilgiris and can enjoy the nature
Toy Train with breattaking view of Ooty valley,Its a must ride for all visitors I would suggest. Its a 50 minute ride with awesome view. try to grab a window seat and click natures beauty. Book your tickets in advance to avoid last minute rush.
A short ride on Nilgiri mountain railway,"We traveled from Ooty to Coonoor one way by this train and took a bus back to Ooty. It was a joyful ride and seems like you are in the last century. Seats are like wooden benches, but the scenery is beautiful around. It travels at a slow speed and makes a few stops on the way before reaching Coonoor. It is best to purchase tickets and then wait around at the station."
Wonderful Experience,"If you didn't travel in this you will loss something . Springs , Forests, Bridges ....wonderful experience. If you are to ooty keep sitting left side. Book 03 months before through IRCTC . Its hard to get seats at nearing days ."
Ooty Toy train - A MUST experience !!,"You wouldn’t disagree with me if I tell that the Toy train is by far one of the biggest attractions in Ooty. And why not? It summarizes the essence of Nilgiris – lush green tea estates, towering Nilgiri/Eucalyptus trees, beautiful bridges on which the train chugs, countless tunnels where darkness consumes the space and leads to light at the end. These and many memories which make this a very special journey. It’s not just the scenery that soothe the eye - the smell of fresh Eucalyptus, the sound of train chugging slowly along the track,  cool breeze that hits your face and send the hair flying back – everything makes this a special ride."
"Excellent ride for kids ,Book ticket online in advance","When i went to OOTY last year i got the tickets for toy train.Basically you need to stand in queue at least an hour before the counter opens and there are limited number tickets One person can get max 4 tickets per head Once seating capacity is over they will issue standing tickets that too around 40 So will recommend you to book tickets online if it is in your must do list Coming to train, if you get seat next to window you are lucky :) for adults it feels good and for kids it is excellent In my opinion one should experience this toy train journey at least once during any of your ooty visits"
Nice ride with beautiful scenery,"Demand of tickets are high in peak season had to stand in que for 2 hrs to get tickets but worth for the wait. Try to capture right side window seat if traveling from UAM Ootty to ONR Coonnor with beautiful scenic view of tea garden, valley, eucalyptus trees and tunnels. An enjoyable ride for a hour with only rack railway tracks in India and world's heritage."
just average train journey,"today me nd family took the train ride from ooty to Connoor. it was jusy ok. The view you get from train are just similar to what you get during road travel in ooty. so one shud take this only if it is at least a 3 day trip. else it is better to spend more time in places like botanical garden,lakes,view points and eucaliptus forests"
Ooty tour,Enjoyed the journey on this train. Started from coonor to ooty. Classic train quite comfortable ride with good scenic views.
Must go,It's one of the best activity which a person. Should never miss...the train journey is for approx 1hr. Please book ur ticket in advance from irctc website and destination will be ooty to canoor
Nice journey... Connoor to ooty... ,"Actually tickets are selling online when we reached only general tickets are available, so better book 1st class ticket online, for a more stylish experience. Nice journey for an hour. Memorable."
Execellent,"Excellent journey & experience in life. If you do not go this place, you can not imagine how looks natural view."
Must do when you are in Ooty,"Awesome experience, one should not miss. Ooty is our favorite destination and we often travel to this place whenever we feel like. If you are visiting Ooty, do not miss the Mountain Railway Trip - the best way to explore and experience the beauty of the valley.Complete trip vlog at 'Couple on Wheelz'  our Youtube Channel."
you need a lot of patience to board this train,u need to wait atleast 1.3 hrs in line to procure a reserved ticket sitting that too doesnt guranty your reservation..after resrvation you are required to make a Q half an hour before train arrival.the train reservation starts only 2 hrs prior to departure time. there are 4 trains up and down direction and with limited seat availablity 1 person is allowed with 4 tickets only for eg if you need to board 12 pm train reservation starts and 10.30 but all the wait is deserving for the ride must visit in life time
Memorable journey ,"First of all, much against popular notion that the first class tickets would all get booked online, we were able to get first class tickets like few other fellow passengers at the railway station counter. One has to be present at the counter by minimum 45-60 mins before the scheduled departure of the train for a higher chance of getting tickets because the coaches and seats are limited. The journey is very scenic much to the excitement of children and adults alike. Duration of about an hour to reach Ooty. A memorable trip in a cute heritage train."
🚂🚎🚎🚎nilgiri mountain railway ,its such a great experience to travel in between ooty to coonoor you will see such kind of amazing views there dont miss it if you are in ooty🚂🚎🚎🚎
UNESCO train,"Had a great experience of traveling in the UNESCO toy train,my friends too experienced and enjoyed it."
Lazily soothing to do,Very nice journey lazily and soothingly going in the train. Like the scenery around and great to travel around.
A Memorable trip,"Hayi have visited in this heritage Train after having ticket ,after wait of 2.5 hours  . but no problem such a good journey , what a scenic view, train pass in tunnels , between mountains   and valleys. hole panoramic natural views from train. a journey during 1 hour for memory of life .i tried to book a seat but i could not help this because a long wait list till next days . so i went for general ticket in Que and i gated.but should be more trains for this trip because there are only 3 trains between ooty to Coonoor and connoor to ooty too ! Thankssandra"
Much hype over nothing,"Except that it is the cheapest way to reach Ooty from Coonoor and that it skips the routine traffic jams on roads to Ooty, there is nothing exceptional about this journey. Better views by road."
Heritage toy train ,Book advance if u want to journey from ooty to coonoor or coonoor to ooty. Very nice to see the beauty during journey of 1 hour.
Nice,It is a beautiful heritage railway service.Every Ooty visited must vTravel in this train.We travel from Ooty to Coonoor.It was really nice experience.
Toy train,"The old train is nice, the journey had some nice bits, but often you couldn't see anythingIn carriage of 6 adults (and kids) 5 adults fell asleep during the journey"
Experience of its own kind,"Travelling from mettupalayam to ooty by train is experience if it's kind. One should not miss as the while journey is filled with nature. If you are admirer of nature and love for photography then take a ride and you will not regret.If you go by car it's just 2 hrs ride to ooty from down but train journey takes half a day but worth it. Book your tickets in advance as its always fully booked and over crowded. Train passes through tunnels, mountains, tea estates with splendid breathtaking views of mountains. Train stops down for you to take pictures so charge your phone full as nature has plenty to offer.You should be patient as the ride takes time but plenty to enjoy. Highly recommended!!!"
Ooty trip ,"Toy Train 🚉Never mis this opportunity to travel from ooty to. Coonoor.You can see the Awesome view, nature, view points, it passes through tunnel.. Must go at least once.."
Beautiful landscape,"The best would be to travel from Mettupalayam to coonoor as it is only 3.5hours. The train goes very slowly so after sometime you might get bored. Coonoor to Ooty there is no much climb so better to take a car from there otherwise it would take another 2hours. The scenery is worth seeing once a lifetime as it is really amazing,and the stations are so cute just like out of a fairy tale.The train stops in every small station for 10minutes for us to take photos. It would be nice if you book in advance or else you might not get a ticket in general as it is first come first serve and once everyone is seated they stop giving the tokens."
Train travel for an experience,"One of the must do's when in Ooty is to take toy train ride from Ooty to Coonoor. It is the best experience when you travel on this world heritage train. Travel time is hardly 1 hour so it is one of those things that you dont get bored. Few things to be noted. Please book advance tickets thro' IRCTC same time as you are planning travel to Ooty.  Because if you dont book tickets would need to stand in queue for tickets in unreserved coach and it is crowded. First & second class tickets can be booked on IRCTC and ticket is only Rs 25 per person for second class. You can take the 9.15 train to Coonoor and plan to proceed with the sightseeing in Coonoor after reaching there in about an hour. Car can wait at Coonoor station or you can search auto/taxi's at Coonoor itself. The views from the train are similar when you travel by road but certainly you will really like the experience of this train ride and some photos of train. The carriages are heritage stuff of the toy train and so are the small stations. The Coonoor station stall was selling some hot samosa , tea and coffee when train reached here at 10.30 am and it is really very tasty. The train ride is for any visitor, young or old and you will surely not regret it. Considering the overall experience , book prior on IRCTC and enjoy the India's heritage !!"
Scenic journey,This is a small toy train from Ooty to coonoor . It only takes 1 hour for the journey and the ticket is just 10 rs. We stood in line from 6 am to get the tickets. There are two timings 9 am and 12 noon.The trip is worth taking as the whole route is scenic.
Coonoor to Ooty or the other way around by the mountain train,"The train ride is an experience and has a princely charge of 25 rupees for an advanced booking and 10 for spot booking at the station.We booked in advance from Coonoor to Ooty as we were staying at Coonoor. It is a nice journey which takes an hour. Suggest do it if you have enough time on hand, else do the return trip. I would have rated this as Good but the site has Average than a double jump to Very Good."
Travel among woods by train,This trip is mentioned in world heritage tours. The rail was constructed by British. The coaches are small but comfortable.  Book early your tickets.  I am sure it will be a mesmerising journey.
Overcrowded and not worth,"Highly over exaggerate thing. There is ntn so special about it. A. You can have that same sightseeing if you are travelling by car or bus (anything via road)B. They overcrowd the compartments and it is really irritating and all the fun and excitement becomes a big no.C. If it is a kind of ""tourist"" train then need to improve on the service and facilities. Especially train structure and interior."
Nice experience,"Last min plan to try out mountain railways. Managed a second class ticket at the last min. People with back pain, spinal issues should definitely avoid. My daughter loved the ride. Plenty of stops enroute for photo opportunity."
SUPERB JOURNEY,"If you go to Ooty, you should enjoy the train journey. We made a journey from ooty to conoor. It was really a life-time experience."
One-of-a-kind experience,"If you are traveling lean, willing to explore the blue mountain in a quiet way with a plenty of stoppages in between, then the heritage train is your cup of tea. From the songs, screams when the train passes through a tunnel and a great cultural mix, I am carrying a lot of good memories from this experience. If you are choosy and complaining, you should never get in to this train. Plan your trips well ahead during the vacation and season periods."
Not worth it.,The train is ok if u travel in 1st class. We had a bunch of noisy youngsters who kept screaming throughout the journey from ooty to coonoor. The route is quite scenic. We have to stand in a long que just to get the tickets. It used to be a very enjoyable ride....
Holiday ..,A hour long ride to coonor by this train takes you through some tunnels and a beautiful terraced tea  gardens.  Please book in advance online to save time on waiting  ..
Not to be missed!,"We took the morning train from Ooty to Connoor, which is a good one hour ride. So many positive reviews have been posted that we cannot offer any new details. Suffice it to say that we'd recommend you book first class tickets way in advance, and hope for good luck weather wise. Even for people like me and my wife who are not railway aficionados this is an experience we will not forget!"
Good for first timers!!,You need to sit of right side of train while doing Ooty to Coonoor while you need to sit on left side of train while doing Coonoor to Ooty. This is because there is a mountain all along one side while valley view on other side. Tourist started to click pictures of whatever they were seeing on valley side. After some half an hour few of them were busy on their Whatsapp while others were sleepy. This train takes almost 1 hour to reach Coonoor.If you have not sat in such trains then you should do it otherwise as per my opinion you can skip train ride and go by road to Coonoor.
Heritage mountain railway,"Having tried the Shimla version we looked forwards to this experience.The obvious differentiating factor is the steepness of the track (1:12) which requires a cog-engine and third rail. However,, the fact is that the route is also much less windy which means far fewer turns and viewpoints. Furthermore, the train travels slower on the steep stretches and consequently we found ourselves getting bored after the first hour.We were glad we experienced the journey once but we'd not take this route again."
Fun but long!,"We went on the Nilgiri Train and it was quite fun, although it was a bit long (2h30).  The first half is lot more spectacular than the second half when you go down to Mettupalayam railway station.  And yes...  book by internet because if not, you will not be sure to have a ticket since the office is not always open before train arrival to buy a ticket!"
"amazing views from this Heritage ""Toy"" Railway","We travelled as a group go 3 (my hubby, myself and my mum) in first class from Ooty to Mettupalaiyum. The scenery and the train are incredible and we were really pleased to have pre-booked this as part of our southern India trip.Be aware that the carriages are old, (but so historic and authentic) and we were in a compartment with two long bench seats that face each other but they are quite comfortable (each bench seats 4 people). We were sat next to each other along one bench, and in hind sight we would have reserved 2 window seats as the centre bench seats have a restricted view out of the carriage - only the windows adjacent to each bench end opens, the central door window doesn't and ours were incredibly water stained and dirty - so hard to see out of.That said, we had an amazing trip and met some lovely people in our carriage. The highlight was definitely the steam engine taking us from Coonoor onto the terminus.A great trip and I'd do it again!"
An absolute Yes-Yes,"Most of the trains in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway start from Ooty. At the other end, there is Mettupalaiyam. But there are a few trains from Coonoor to Ooty too.The journey is a beautiful one -- so much so that it would be quite futile to describe in words. We went in the second week of March; less crowds and lovely weather greeted us everywhere. We went by the morning train to Coonoor and returned by the 4pm one.This trip is an absolute must for those people visiting either Ooty or Coonoor. Those coming via Coimbatore have to come to Mettupalaiyam (Rail Code MTP) and take the only train at 7.10 am for the 5 hour journey to Ooty (Rail Code UAM). But for people who have come to Ooty either by bus or taxi, the morning 9.15 am train to Coonoor for the one hour and twenty minutes journey is a real deal.For longer journeys, the second class cars are quite cramped and hence not comfortable. But the shorter journey won't be much of a problem. I am saying this because the first class tickets tend to fill up fast, especially during the holiday season. The difference between the first and second class is in terms of seating space -- 4 sitting instead of 5.Instead of commenting more, I would rather let some pics do the talking."
Heritage train ride worth lifetime,"A must visit in ooty, ride of lifetime. It is train which has completed more than 100 years of service which passes through breathtaking valley and tunnels. Children and adults enjoy alike. The train takes about an hour to reach coonoor which is a  tourist attraction. Only problem is getting the tickets which are limited. I waited for 2 hours for the tickets which is worthwhile."
Picturesque ride,If you manage to get the ticket then ride is quite picturesque and a must do at Ooty.Best is to pre book the tickets on irctc to skip long queues.I would recommend booking general class tickets as their coaches have openable windows unlike first class and are more convenient to take in the view.
An experience!,I don't need to say much as everything has probably already been said. We went to Ooty to take this train ride.
Joy ride... ,-A fantastic journey with family and friends.  Lucky got the tickets and made journey to Kunnnor.  It's really a joy ride.  A must for Ooty tour.
Must do this while visiting nilgiri,You will definitely enjoy the view and ride while going through this train. Try to book very much in advance via IRCTC before bording. You can get tickets on spot but you need to go eary. Try to book for first class as the coches are in front and little comfortable.
Beautiful journey amidst mountains...,"It's a must try if you are visiting ooty.. unique experience.. people know most of the things.. so here I am mentioning only the info to keep in mind while you are choosing this.. ENJOYABLE ONLY IF YOU ARE HAVING WINDOW SEAT :) and it will definitely not help you in any means if you are sitting elsewhere.. window seat is a must... and avoid sitting in the first compartment near engine because of the smoke issues throughout the journey.. Trip from coonoor to mettupalayam or vice versa would be better if you are not ready to accommodate 5 hours journey till ooty. Have some snacks handy especially if you have kids.. Mostly try to avoid the journey if travelling with infants.. they get afraid because of sound & tunnels n it would be pretty difficult to handle them there n there wont be network in case of emergency... good if you are travelling alone or as couple preferably to enjoy the long lasting beauty of travelling amidst mountains, valleys n rivers.. little polluted in recent times.. but cant complaint.."
Book in advance to enjoy...,"We booked on spot and got general ticket.. Bad thing is they allow locals also in that ticket, because of that it becomes a passenger train.  Too overcrowding.. Can't even enjoy.. Locals use it for daily up and down.. Poor management by railway"
OOTY TRAIN RIDE,ME and my friends are went ooty on januvary. we plan the go for ooyt with train. coonoor to ooty we travelled we enjoyed very well.
Experience the travel,Any person who would like to experience what life is - should travel the NMR train once atleast in his life. This would bring fantastic reality despite the train commutes slowly but through the rough terrain with a regular interval break. The Journey till conoor is really great one which takes around 4 hours. the little one in your family will also enjoy. Kindly book the ticket in advance and getting seat on travel day is not suggested. Moreover the train should run on your travel day!!
Nature and old engines - Can you ask for more?,"We traveled from Ooty to Coonoor and back using the Nilgiri Mountain Railway. This journey was my favorite part from our Ooty trip, hence the double travel. The trains are pretty decent  and have  a rustic appearance.  They move quite slowly which helped capturing all the beautiful scenic beauties on our way. Best part ? They rides are super cheap!!"
Choo Choo!,We had reserved seats in our carriage but it was crammed full!The 45 minute journey from Ooty to Coonoor for filled with breathtaking views with many photo opportunities.
Ok......but could have been better,"Visited as part of a tour group. 2nd class tickets gave us a carriage that would fit 8 people but 10 were squashed in......good job we were all slender people !!I was lucky, I had the open window seat, so did get a view of the passing scenery......the windows were dirty, so impossible to take any photos through.Our train was diesel but we did see a steam train puffing along on the track !! As a quaint experience it was fine for the hour and a half we were on it. Be sure to use the toilet before you get on the train....."
Unique,Enjoyed lot with this chaiya chaiya  train. One can remember your childhood even in the old age while travelling in this vintage train.
Needs to be experienced at least once,We travelled by 2nd class as first class tickets are almost impossible to get. It cost us 25 rupees each for the journey from ooty to coonoor. The train was clean and so quaint! We reached coonoor about 15 minutes before time. The view from ooty to coonoor is breath taking and the journey was quite comfortable. The only thing i have to say against it is that there's no luggage space.
Poor visitor experience,"I had wanted to travel on this railway for years but the actual experience was so disappointing, quite the worst steam train experience I've had anywhere in the world. It could be so good but is badly managed.Reserved seats are five on a bench which can seat only four. The windows are filthy so only those in corner seats can see through the opening windows. Come on management, these are things which can be improved.....which ought to be improved. Paying customers from all over the world deserve better."
Unmissable!,"Nilgiri mountain railwayUnmissable!Put aside the absurd schedule, the ludicrous early morning start, the typically Indian queuing system for unreserved tickets, the appalling cramped uncomfortable seats and the clapped-out rolling stock left over from the Raj! This is the only way for a tourist to reach Ooty. Going by car is boring, by bus terrifying!Revel in the the 5am arrival at the station to meet the local who’s queuing for you, have a disagreement with other Europeans who accuse you of queue jumping, be encouraged by the Indians who seem to find having a man holding your place is normal, eat your railway breakfast of iddlies, vada and sambar in a foil box with a plastic spoon too fragile even to stir tea. Finish with a chai in an Indian Railways branded paper cup!The steam-hauled journey is breathtaking and conducted at a sedate pace (down to walking speed at times) with plenty of stops to take on water and allow everyone to alight for a wander round and plenty of pictures. The second part of the journey from Conoor to Ooty has the steam loco replaced by a diesel which spanks along rather faster. (Since the scenery on this stretch is less impressive and the knees are feeling decidedly stiff, it’s all to the good).Unfortunately our schedule meant we couldn’t take the train back down. Next time I’d make sure we did, and I think we’d go First Class!"
Ho Hum,We went from Coonoor to Ooty.  Interesting history and worth the ride if this is what you enjoy.  There are a few scenic episodes but most of the trip is through scrub woodland and no worthwhile view at all.
Enjoyable way to travel,"I did two trips, Coonoor to Ooty (diesel) and Coonoor to Mettupalayam (steam). Nice relaxing way to travel for 10 rupees in general carriage. Steam train down to Mettupalayam was great and included a tea stop. Make sure you also have a look at the museum at Mettupalayam station."
Best option to visit Conoor ,"Fastest, comfortable and cheapest option to visit Conoor. Enjoy the scenic view of valley as the train moves along its course. Advise to young parents Travelling with children : click pics but don't neglect your child."
Fantastic views,"It was a jolly event starting with the scramble for seats as foreigners couldn’t readily tell the difference between the classes of carriages.  The guard got everyone sorted into the right compartment then blew the whistle.  Once we were all settled it was a fun, short ride from Ooty to Conoor.   We were on the wrong side of the carriage for photos (left hand side).   It was embankment nearly all the way.  The best views were on the right hand side and as the windows weren’t especially clean you couldn’t take photos through them. There were only 8 seats in the carriage.   Those who had the better seats didn’t offer to swap seats even for 5 minutes for photos.  We would have in their place!  A Diesel engine was used for this section of the line.  We were told that the views on the next section from Conoor to Munnar were fabulous but it was quite a long journey.    Not be missed by steam enthusiasts!"
Most popular toy-train ride in India,"The nilgiri mountain railway is known to be best tourist attraction of Ooty & its not wrong at all. First of all i need to clarify that toy train service is limited to Ooty & Coonoor only. The first train that leaves ooty is of 9.15 am & reaches Coonoor at 10.15 am. Surprisingly when we went there at the Ooty station at 8.30 am they said all accommodations are full though that seemed absolutely impossible as that train had got fixed number of reserved seats & rest were all unreserved seats. But railway authority tactfully made all seats available for advance reservation so that they can earn more money. We were asked to stand in a long queue & after the train arrives from Coonoor, we were given tickets for standing. Basically this was a poor tactics from Indian railways. Still most of the people were so over-enthusiast that they didnt bother standing as like we. Compartments are quite small & 2 persons can't stand in the corridor side-by-side. Still that 1 hour journey was impeccable in terms of the environmental view. It ran in a very enjoyable speed & crossed 3 tunnels en-route. The enthusiasm of all passengers (99% were tourists) made us very happy at the end. So i suggest if u have a car, u can ask ur driver to go to Coonoor station by himself & wait there & u take this train journey to Coonoor. After reacing there u can visit the tourist attractions of Coonoor by car itself."
Must visit ,AwesomeMust visit place U can try ooty to coonoor by train then visits places in coonoor and then again come back by train.. awesome views.. heritage train
Try It Once,"I was expecting a cute toy train like they show in the movies to turn up but it was really nothing of that sort. But having said that, if you are traveling to Coonoor from Ooty, then, you must take this train. It's a fun journey nonetheless. And besides, it takes only an hour to get to Coonoor."
A great fun way to spend a morning!,"We only managed to do the stretch between Connoor and Ooty but that was sufficient to get the best out of this. Unfortunately, Connoor is the point at which they uncouple the steam engine and change to a diesel, but that didn't really detract from the whole experience. We thought initially that this train was largely a tourist attraction but it is very inexpensive (10 rupees) and was used mostly by locals - by the time we reached Ooty it was packed with locals.  Great views - especially if you can get a window seat on the left side of the train"
Beautiful Journey,"We reached station at 8.00 AM for ticket booking as You have to get into queue by 8.45 for a train of 9.15.Once the journey started, it was beautiful scenery all around. A must have experience once you visit Ooty."
A must do in Ooty,"We had a wonderful ride from Ooty to Connoor on this railway. We booked tickets on IRCTC and were able to get the tickets 2 days before. Although it was a beautiful trip, with superb valley views it would definitely be really beautiful in monsoon."
