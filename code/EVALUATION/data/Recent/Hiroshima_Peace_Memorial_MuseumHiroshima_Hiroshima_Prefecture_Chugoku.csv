Emotional and memorable experience,"A great museum in memory of the terrible consequences of the atomic bomb. A must visit if you are staying in Hiroshima. It is an important reminder of the cruel incident that happened. May it never happen again. Mind you a visit here can be very emotional and I reccomend to go see it with a friend/familymember/partner. Outside the Peace Memorial Museum, there is an open space with a peaceful pond where a flame is burning for peace on earth. Another memorial is dedicated to the children who died in the bombing, Childrens Peace Monument, symbolized by Sadaki Sasaki (reccomend to read her story)."
A Moving Experience,"We considered this museum to be the highlight of our visit to Hiroshima's Peace Park. It not only captures the horror of what happened as a result of the Aug. 6, 1945 atomic-bomb attack on the city,  but it also offers information on what led to the blast, Hiroshima today and the need to eliminate all nuclear weapons from the world. The story is presented in two buildings through what I consider to be a fairly balanced presentation with excellent exhibits. These include videos, photos, victims' comments, their personal possessions and bomb-damaged artifacts. Some sections can be emotionally draining, such as the stories of children victims and the graphic descriptions of medical problems, resulting from the blast. The rooms' dark walls intensified the discomfort I felt when viewing these types of exhibits. Information signs appear in Japanese and English and there are interactive elements for visitors, who would like more details. The case is definitely made for history to never repeat itself with nuclear weapons. We visited on an October 2019 morning and found the museum to be incredibly crowded. I often had to wait to see some of the exhibits. Many school groups were in the rooms, but the children stayed fairly quiet and were extremely well behaved. We spent more than three hours here and had a nice lunch in the cafe before leaving to look at the myriad monuments and memorials in the park. The museum admission at the time was a most reasonable 200 Y (about $1.90 U.S.). It is on the south side of the park and easily accessible by public transport."
An absolute MUST.  Do NOT miss. Wraps-up everything else you've seen in the last 2/3 hours,"I admit that by the time we got here, I was nearing my limit - bombed-out you might say. All that reflection and soul-searching was taking its toll. And there was a queue and we had to pay, and .......But I went in anyway. Rather unlikely to visit Hiroshima again, so 'Carpe Diem'.So glad I did. Now it has to be said - there is nothing nice, fun, pleasurable, amusing, entertaining, nor enjoyable about this Museum, but it is a superbly well-done exhibition, display and learning opportunity - sombre at times, highly thought provoking & challenging.It just wrapped-up everything else we had seen in the preceeding few hours. It gave me some sort of closure and allowed me to feel OK about myself, my emotions, reactions and that I had paid my Respects, amnd could now leave.1 - 2 Hrs in here alone is almost required, judging by the foot traffic, we encountered."
Must see but the expect some lopsided viewpoints.,"Number 3 site to see in Hiroshima.  It is historically important to see the effects of atomic weapons in the HOPE WE NEVER USE THEM AGAIN.  The reasons for or against the need to use this weapon at that time in history can be widely debated.  The museum projects that Hiroshima was an innocent city.  The museum, incorrectly, states the atomic bombs were used because the US wanted to gain an upper hand with the Soviet Union for post WWII.  The museum fails to mention the estimated casualties the US and Japan would have suffered if Japan was invaded (Operations Olympic and Coronet), nor the potential use of chemical weapons form both sides, nor a long list of other issues that would have occurred with a conventional battle on Honshu (including the fact that we could still be fighting WWII---last Japanese soldier was captured in 1972).  The museum doesn't mention the death, destruction, and inhumane treatment the Japanese soldiers wrought on their prisoners and conquered people in other countries.  So it's lopsided in the historical portrayal but still a must see."
Will never forget,This experience was so moving and extremely important. It is a must see sight on a trip to Japan and the exhibit with the art made my survivors of the nuclear blasts was heartwrenching. An important place to see and an important part of history. We stayed for around 2 hours but could definitely stay longer. The park and memorials around are nice to walk through and it was extremely well done.
Impressive musuem,"A must. And the trip to Hiroshima is worth just for visiting the museum. We all have heard about the atomic boming, we all know how terrible it was. But the museum reminds you the effects and drama it caused. No hate is shown, just sadness. Everything is explained with a very sensible touch and you won't feel indiferent."
Never forget,"The museum dedicated to the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima, which occured during WWII, is definitely the one must see site in the city. It holistically tells the story of the events and days / months before and after the drop of the A-bomb and how generations of Japanese (and others) were traumtized by this terrible event. One can hardly not be shaken by this exposition and not feel a sense of solidarity with and sorrow for the people of Hiroshima. It is an important landmark that shows the indefinite cruelty humans can be capable of, but also the kindness and forgiveness that can be achieved no matter what."
Fantastic Piece of History,"The Peace Memorial Museum was outstanding.  One of the best  places to visit.  Although history states that this was a terrible conflict, the museum states that there is hope for the future.  Some of the pictures and artifacts left a striking effect on me.  Once the Corona Virus is over, please go and see this museum."
Must see,This is a must see museum when visiting Hiroshima. The displays and pictures are really somber and sad to see. The devastation was horrible for the people of Japan. We must never let this happen again.
A Heartbreaking Experience,"On my trip to Japan last summer, this was the first place I went to. As far as Japan attractions go, this one set the bar high. The exhibits will make most people tear up and make Americans realize what they did to the Japanese in order to end WWII. The museum is educational, well-put together, and overall very impressive. One thing I will note is that young children may actually learn quite a bit from this exhibit. Though it does cover death, it can be a good teaching method if the kids take the tragedy part well. This truly is a must-see attraction in Hiroshima or anywhere in Japan."
Heart-wrenching,Visited in June 2016 with my husband and brother. Difficult to see the scope of destruction and the horrible impact on so many lives. The videos were very descriptive and told the personal stories and accounts of many individuals. The artifacts from buildings and the domestic items and clothing (particularly from the children) was tear inducing. Everyone should visit to understand the impact of war and atomic weapons.
Important stop if you're in Japan,This museum focuses on the real life people stories. You can spend many hours here if you read all of them.War is never the answer.
a must see in memory of all lost.,"on my husband's wish list to see when we returned to japan as a tourist rather than for work. took the Shinkansen from tokyo, about 4 hours with one change. checked into the candeo hotel and walked here, not that far away. a lovely warm autumn day. bought sandwiches along the way and sat on the river bank to eat our lunch. crossed the bridge and looked back at the a bomb dome which we visited later. stopped at the children's peace monument with the cranes. walked along the centre of the peace park and passed and stopped at the cenotaph and the eternal flame. not too busy in the park. entered and paid at the main building of the museum, an attractive, low, long building. one is directed with signs as to where and how to enter. very busy. very quiet. all the exhibitions are terribly heart wrenching, especially the children memories. hard to read all of it. i believe we went through the east building also. looking outside, there were many groups of school children arriving. after, we welcomed walking through the park to continue on our day."
Important and haunting ,"We took the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Hiroshima to spend the day visiting the museum. The first exhibits focus on the human stories following the atomic bomb. They are heart wrenching . Although crowded, everyone files through quietly. The second part described the military aspect, decisions etc, in a factual way. Outside the memorial park has many beautiful memorials and a view of the dome left standing after the blast.En route back we stopped in Okayama to see the great garden: Korakuen."
Puts things into perspective,Left this museum different to how I entered. Really interesting and amazing museum which everyone can take something from.
Go,There is little more to say than just go. It’s incredibly well done and I cannot begin to express how moving it is. Just go.
An important history of Japan,"I did not expect much when I entered the peace memorial museum but I left on a higher emotion, the memorial had me reading every story wanting to learn more about the history of Japan."
Excellent Summary of Tragedy!,"Graphic in parts, but it was honest - which was refreshing to read. Tearful, emotional, sad, tragic, and the list of words can go on and on. Took a day trip down in Shinkansen from Kyoto, spent around 4 hours in Hiroshima, visiting all the sites at Ground Zero. We hope our World never does this to anybody ever again -there is no reason for it, War is tragic enough without Atomic bombs too..."
"Confronting, graphic but needs to be seen","This museum is very confronting, emotional and a must visit when you are here. It is history. It happened. It shows the effects in all its brutality. Belongings left by the victims, photos, what happens to glass, stone, metal from the heat. A persons shadow eerily left behind on a building where he sat when the impact happened. You will feel grief, pain anger and sadness as you walk through this very important museum."
Very tearful,"This is a very solemn museum recoding the impact that the bomb had on the civilian population of Hiroshima Very sad, personal stories are shared, along with artefacts Be prepared for the crowds and lots of reading, and bring some tissues"
Emotional,"Highly recommend coming here, there is some photos in there that can be confronting for children so beware (my son just closed his eyes in certain areas). It's an emotional experience walking through there i know i shed a tear as did a few others."
Superb,Great museum well set out with good information in English. I think the displays regarding children especially those who were helping to prepare firebreaks were most heartbreaking.
Beautiful but emotional experience ,Absolutely outstanding museum. Very tasteful and educational. It’s emotional when faced with the scale and magnitude of suffering the Western Allies caused to Hiroshima and the Japanese.
An emotional experience,"The day we visited the museum was the Japanese equivalent of a bank holiday. It was also hot and sunny and a Saturday, so there were many families and people in general there. When we walked round it was very crowded,adults and children walked shoulder to shoulder and everyone was completely silent!! It was an extremely moving experience.The museum is a modern building with a pleasant cafe and interesting shops."
A unique emotional experience,"Visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum triggered lots of emotions and questions. It helps all the visitors to make a decision whether they would become a peacemaker or not and to reflect upon wars, arms, weapons and especially nuclear ones. It is essential to remember that war is not limited by space and that it can affect all the lives of various populations in many parts of the world. It also made us realize that the conservation of artifacts and historical items is important if you want to make history believable. Seeing the old clothes and glasses, fragments of buildings and other infrastructures and linking them to the written texts was a very complex process and helped us to become witnesses of the horror the Japanese people living in Hiroshima. The bad effects of the war on children were clearly demonstrated through the exhibition and this provoked an immense sadness. The view of thousands of paper cranes near the Sadako Sasaki statue would allow hope for a peaceful world. Thank you so much to those who have built this museum and rasembled all the historic items inside since you are allowing the world to know more about other aspects of World War II and about the resilience of the Japanese people."
Impressive,"I went to the one in Nagasaki and wondered if this would be the same but it's totally different, and also very impressive! From the moment I walked in, chills ran down my spine. The pictures, stories, paintings, items displayed, very nicely done even though it's so horrific what happened. Take a moment to listen to/watch a view of the stories as well."
Harrowing representation of the atom bomb horror,"Harrowing and humbling presentation of the events of the bomb attacks. The memoirs and artefacts from the families of those killed are very moving and sensitivity presented. Like Auschwitz and other sites of human horror upon  others, this an important place for people to visit/understand as part of future prevention."
Excellent Presentation and Preservation of History,"Before my visit, I had read up about the museum and prepared myself for what i may encounter.  Still, it was an extremely moving and heartbreaking experience.  The exhibits, stories, artifacts breathtakingly convey the horror and devastation of the bombing (and the aftermath).  I think the presentation and exhibits were nicely thought-out and laid-out - it tells a (very sad) story vividly without being overly political.  Irrespective of one's opinion about the War and the various countries' roles, this museum is a ""must-see"" if you are visiting Hiroshima."
Remembering ,It was the most powerful visit in Japan. The memorial museum was an amazing addition to our visit. I suggest that those who visit the park would visit the museum! It’s worth seeing it!
Well presented.,"The museum is well presented.  Be prepared, it's graphic.  The museum has a wonderful map of Hiroshima which details the before, during and after of the bombing in scale.  After watching the map, you understand exactly how things occurred and what everything was like before and after.  Once you check the map out you enter the exhibits that show the human side."
Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"As long as you are in this area please take time to see all the sights. A reminder of what devastation a bomb can do. It was beautifully done, the history is sad. It brought tears to my eyes as it did to many who visitied. RRIP to all the innocent souls who died so tragically in this war..."
The sadness still there..,A long way using shinkanshen train..i visit the hiroshima peace memorial. Started from the 1st floor just like read a story..and the sadness is getting higher especially when we saw several materials collected from the bom victim. This museum complex is really big and contain with several building which has different function..really sad to hear the stories during this tragedy..but the tragedy shall be our lesson for our future..not to be forgotten..
Mournful experience,To see some of the graphic pictures and accounts of the day is a very somber experience.  The trip through the museum by oneself is good but get the audio guide when it's crowded as you will not be able to read all the descriptions on the exhibits.
Important Museum,Important to visit this museum when Travelling to Japan. It is also near the memorial park.Borg Places narrats about the A-bomb and its terrible consequencies.
Heart warming experience ,"When visiting Hiroshima, the Peace Memorial Museum is one of the must do museums. We made the mistake of not getting an audio guide and felt as though we missed out. We weirdly couldn’t go back to purchase it, so if you’re keen on the stories behind the items, you definitely want to get an audio guide. The museum is great and has information cards, so it’s still informative without the audio guides. It’s very easy to follow the directions and the museum is in a nice big open area, so you won’t feel over crowded. The entry fee without audio guides were ¥200 per person. If you’re into these museums, which we are, plan for around 3 hours if you want to view everything including listening to the videos with a very leisurely stroll. Be prepared to leave a little emotional after hearing the stories and seeing the items. We certainly felt as though it offered value  and would definitely recommend it."
Hiroshima,Good and short visit. All enjoyed it. Especially the the Shinkasen ride from Osaka. Advise to visit in the day time.
So interesting,I was surprised.... in a good way. It´s a place where you can feel peace and it makes you think how simple things are so important. After that visit you will be touched in a special way.
A must see!,This is a very important and moving experience. The grounds of the Memorial are stunning and poignant. The museum itself is beautifully done and conveys the horrific nature of what happened on a very personal level. Leave plenty of time and be prepared to need time when you are through to feel and process what you've just seen.
Free,Free entry..near the Atomic Dome...worth visit when you are in the area..worth visiting the peace memorial park too..
Peace memorial,Good place to learn and see what war do with videos and pictures in side the building. Small fee to enter. Will take above 1 to 2 hr.
Entrance requires small fee of 200 yen,"The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is located inside the Peace Park.  Just like the Peace Memorial Museum in Nagasaki, it houses remnants of the events from the Hiroshima bombing.  Entrance requires a small fee of 200 yen per person."
Moving Museum,"Informative and heartbreaking, the museum is very well laid out and handles crowds well. Be prepared to invest a significant time if you want to fully experience everything as despite it being a less busy time this museum was very crowded.  Great explanations in English and Japanese."
You Must see,It was incredible. It is sad to see what happened but the  way the people  reacted and help themselves to make a nation. The museum is very well operated with a lot of information. We went from Kyoto by train for a day. It is very easy to walk from the station. It is very interesting to see how peace is the most important
A reminder for peace.,It is a well maintained beautiful museum full of information of the devastating consequence of war. It is a very pleasant and informative tour.
Such an important place to visit!,This place is really well done!It has so many personal stories and is really well set out.Found the interviews really interesting too.No more Hiroshimas.
Giving the innocent people a voice,This museum very effectively relays the human aspect of the Atomic Bomb by giving they innocent victims a voice.  Hear their stories to really understand the impact. Confronting experience but a must do while in Japan
A ‘must do’ whilst in Horishima,"This museum has been put together so well. It is interesting, shocking, heart wrenching, and wonderful all at once. Captures the horror inflicted upon Hiroshima with unnecessary gore. If you don’t think nuclear armament should be stopped - I think this museum will change your mind. Highly recommend - but sensitive children may not be suited."
Very moving experience,We visited this museum on Hiroshima Day- 6th Aug 2019. It was extremely busy on this very important day and we didn't get to read all the stories or get to experience everything in full but what we did read made us all feel very emotional. This place is a must see. We traveled to Hiroshima for 1 day only as we felt that as we were in Japan on this special day we just had to visit Hiroshima and so pleased we did.
A moment of prayer,"I have been putting Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my travel plan for quite sometime and finally got the chance though only Hiroshima this time. Reading a lot of history on the two cities in particular the A-bomb unfortunate event back in the horrific month of August 1945, over 70 years ago, I guess I am intrigued by what the two cities look like now. Once you step down from the shinkansen at the train station, you’ll find a city full of vibrations and lovely. What remains of the A-bomb blast is contained in the ground zero in the Memorial Park area. And stepping into the Museum is just like you were brought back to 1945 seeing the pictures, witnesses in videos and belongings of the victims of the bomb. A heartfelt goes to the people of Hiroshima as it says, for the victims,it will never end.God bless"
Unmissable if in Hiroshima ,This museum should be mandatory for any leader of a nation with nuclear weapon capabilities. It is gut wrenching and heartbreaking to read the personal accounts of the experiences of those whose lives were irrevocably changed by the dropping of the bomb. The images and accounts are graphic and the young people (older teens) we were travelling with on a school trip were deeply moved and very subdued following the visit. The museum shop has some beautiful peace themed items that are worth considering if you are needing to bring souvenirs or moments home.
A must see to understand Japan ,"We visited all of us familyTeens and young adultsThe whole visit will teach to all, something about humankind..and past horrors.What I m saying also is that it s very visualMuseum.Young kids should be carefully attended , when making the visit and have the right explanations"
A very sobering experience ,It’s worth visiting this museum a a reminder to current generations why nuclear weapons should never have been used and why they must continue to be banned indefinitely.
A must do when in Japan,"A very powerful memorial and museum. A must do, if only to remind us of the devastation war causes. You need at least 3 hours but I'm sure some could spend a whole day there."
Highly recommend ,We paid the extra 200 yen and got the audio guide and it was so worth it! Everyone would crowd to read the signs but with the audio guide you can stand back and listen and look at the pictures or items without having to get through the crowds. I learnt so much and it was truly an eye opening experience.
Learn a lot,"This is a modern museum, get yourself the audio guide. You can see interview with survivors, touch melted object, learn about the decision to bomb and the impact on the live of the locals."
Day trip,"We took a day trip on the JR from Kyoto for a few hours. Upon arriving at the station, our JR pass got us in the red site seeing bus for free. We took that to the museum. We did a self guided tour with took about an hour and a half. The items and information provided really put things into perspective. The displays were easy enough for our kids to understand as well. We walked to the park and saw the various item there all the way to the dome."
Historical and emotional,"Walk through slowly, explore and read every single captions on the photos. Minimal entrance fee. There is also a cafe on site."
The museum of anecdotal stories,"Prior to visiting; I was mistakenly under the illusion that this museum would detail Japan's involvement in WW2 culminating in an atomic bomb being dropped on the site of the museum. It is not this. Please do not expect more than a momentary museum placard detailing any events (including WW2 or Japanese operations in China) leading to the dropping of the weapon. However, it's not quite a ""peace museum"" either. More so a grizly monument to women and children that lost their lives in both the impact and related radiation events immediately thereafter. By way of museum quality, this is okay. The first two rooms are world class. Then it deteriorates rapidly to anecdotal stories and children's items of clothing. Unfortunately, some of the history is.. revisionist at best (at worst - knowingly omitting information)- but it is more smartly done than the overt examples in the Hanoi Hilton museum, Vietnam. I can best detail this obscurance when we left the exhibition. Upon exiting, my (non WW2 aware) partner queried why the allies dropped a bomb on Japan when everyone was banded together fighting the Nazis in Europe..."
Excellent museum,"A great museum dedicated to the bombing and aftermath in Hiroshima. The audio guide is well worth getting. It can get quite crowded, and some of the images, stories and artefacts are confronting."
Incredibly moving,"The world must never again be allowed to unleash the horror of atomic weaponry, and this museum shows you just exactly why. It is quite graphic at times (there is a warning about bringing in children at the entrance, for good reason), but never sensationalist and the presentations are emotive but necessarily so; the whole museum is so thoughtfully and beautifully done. I would defy anyone to go without being enormously affected by what you see. An absolute must for everyone."
"Highly selective ""history""","I spent half a day with a Japanese government-licensed guide touring this museum. I'm  sorry to say that she presented a dishonest, completely one-sided diatribe on the events that led up to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Astonishingly, she said the US was responsible for starting the Pacific War because Japan was ""forced"" to attack Pearl Harbor after the US embargoed the export of scrap metal to Japan in 1941.  No mention of why the embargo was instituted--which was the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. (Text inside the museum correctly states that Japan started the war.)  She (and the museum) naturally focused on the 146,000 casualties in Hiroshima, and there are hundreds of pictures of people with horrific injuries.  But neither she nor the museum made any mention of 300,000 Chinese that the Imperial Japanese Army slaughtered in Nanjing alone. Throughout her presentation my guide all but accused the US of committing a war crime here.  She said an unspecified crew member of the ""Enola Gay,"" the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on  Hiroshima, had visited the city a few years earlier.  When asked if he regretted killing innocent civilians, she quoted him as saying ""there are no innocents in war.""  She said she thought he should have been killed for saying so.  ""Innocent victims"" is the overall theme of  the museum, but there is no mention of the fact that there was a major Japanese Army base in the city.  I lived in Japan as a child from 1950 to 1953.  I've been back several times, and have always been treated with great courtesy and friendliness.  I was frankly shocked to have virulent anti-American propaganda thrown in my face, and quite distressed to see other people in my tour group eating it up because they were clearly ignorant of the truth.  The Japanese government historically has had great difficulty coming to terms with its behavior in WWII.  This museum was filled with school children, which makes me wonder what they're being taught in school and what they take away from their field trips to places like this."
"Hiroshima , the world cannot forget","It is sad to see at the museum, well preserved , one could go back in time and feel the pain and suffering, sad to see.On the other hand it is well preserved with minute detail, has to be appreciated, such thing should never happen again in the human history of mankind."
Sobering. A must-see.,This is a very moving museum; I spent a lot of time trying to control my emotions. The architecture of Kenzō Tange is superb.
Crowded but worth the visit,"The day I visited, they allowed multiple large groups to enter at about the same time, which made for a very uncomfortably crowded viewing of the images.   There is a warning as you enter the main exhibit about the graphic nature.  It can be disturbing if one is sensitive."
A moving and solemn experience,We were pleased that we had first walked around the park visiting the numerous memorials and tributes. The Peace Memorial Museum shows the devastation to life not only instantaneously but sadly after-effects of the uranium on those that died in the days and years after the bomb. There were large groups of school children visiting at the time. So important for the younger generations to understand. Also a tribute to them for being quiet and respectful in very solemn and moving displays of everyday people whose lives changed forever.  If we had seen this first we probably would have not appreciated the park as much as we went quietly back to our hotel deep in thought.
A must do in Hiroshima ,"Firstly went to a slide show/talk relating the story of a young school girl present on the day, then a walk around the museum with exhibits of before, during and after-a struggle at times as very thought provoking. Ended with a walk through the park to the iconic remains of the Dome-clearly a must do for all generations to learn from the past....."
A Sad and Thoughtful Experience,"The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is a must see.  It's a mind numbing view with pictures and stories of the people who were killed or injured when the A-Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on 6th August, 1945.  You cannot but feel for the people involved and who suffered for years after that day.  The display was viewed by many when I was there, it was a silent and solemn procession past the display cases.  It brought me to tears.  May it never happen again!"
Day trip to Hiroshima,"We came to Hiroshima for a one night stay. The Peace Memorial Park and museum were the first places we went to. The museum details the plight of the civilian victims after the atom bomb was dropped on this city. It was crowded with many school groups and other tourists, but was quiet as we looked at the displays. For me the most harrowing displays were not the scenes of extensive damage but a rusted tricycle and and the picture of two small children who were near ground zero. The other displays show pre war Hiroshima as a thriving city; after the bomb, a devastated one. Today Hiroshima is again a thriving modern city demonstrating resilience. One can argue the politics and justifications for using the ""Bomb"" but the personal experience we shared at the museum is just as important, to remember that ordinary people and children suffered, not just here but on both sides."
Sombre experience,"The devastation brough about by the N- bomb is vividly depicted through photographs, videos and belongings of survivors and victims. It is heart wrenching to say the least."
"Very, very impressive.",Very impressive. Besides information on the war and the development of the A-bomb the museum is Full with stuff that tells of the persons that fell victim to the bombing and contains countless witness accounts that blew me away. This was the highlight of our 17 Day Japan trip and is one that must not be missed if you're in Japan.
Impressive and moving,"The museum is a very impressive memory to the horror of bombing Hiroshima. Smart way of displaying photos, items and documents."
Very moving and sad museum but incredibly well done!,"The Peace Memorial Museum was very well done. The entrance fee is cheap and give yourself at least a couple hours to browse the exhibits and read the stories of the victims. I learned a lot while here, and am still saddened by some of the stuff I read, mainly pertaining to the effects of the bomb and how it affected people living in Hiroshima that day. The museum had a lot of personal stories and images of civilians living in Hiroshima that day, very moving. The layout of the museum is well done, and there are a few interactive exhibits. I came early, but as I left there was a long line, so I guess, get here early!"
What Can I Say?,"Consider myself to be fortunate to have paid my respects to those who perished in both Pearl Harbour & Hiroshima. It was more a pilgrimage for me. The Atomic Bomb Dome, Children’s Peace Monument, Students Conscription Monument, Peace Park & Museum. It was so sombre and sensitive. Was fortunate to have a guided tour. The exhibits, paintings & photos brought tears to my eyes. If you visit Japan, please visit Hiroshima and pay your respects to the 200,000 innocent lives lost, so we could be free."
Don't miss it,"No guide for this or peace park is necessary.  Essential to visit.  We allowed 1 hour for this, before checking out of hotel, but should have allowed 2 hours.  Very, very well presented."
A must see ,The museum is brilliant. It really brings home the terrible effects of nuclear bombs. I would insist all politicians are made to visit it to make sure the extremely important lessons of the dropping of the atom bomb are learnt and never repeated. Very well presented. I would recommend hiring the headset to get the commentary in you own language. No visit to Hiroshima should miss this museum. Excellent.
Precious museum. Be prepared for congestion.,This is a place you must go to when you visit Hiroshima. It is very crowded from 10:00 to 15:00. Full of students on school excursions. It is recommended to go to 8:30 or 16:00. Don't forget Please look at the exhibition room on the first basement. This place appeals to never cause the tragedy of Hiroshima again. I realize that nuclear weapons don't let you die like humans.広島を訪れたら行かなければならない場所です。10時から15時は大変混雑します。修学旅行の学生で溢れます。8時30分または16時に行くことをお勧めします。忘れずに地下一階の展示室も観てください。この場所は、二度と広島の悲劇が起こらないよう訴えます。核兵器は人間として死なせてくれないことを実感します。
As moving as the US 9/11 museum,"A truly moving presentation. Very balanced, so as not to vilify either party, but just to present how it happened, the suffering that resulted, and the commitment to non-proliferation that follows.   Plan to spend at least an hour as the displays take a long time to get through."
BETTER THAN LAST YEARS VISIT,I may have been better prepared than last year from the effect you have walking through the remnants of lives lost.
Excellent,Very dramatic and realistic details of what occurred when the atomic bomb was dropped. Well presented.200 yen entry. Hop on hop off bus drops u right outside.Definitely worth a visit.
Really interesting and well made museum,"Really great museum. It gets quite full, especially because many school classes come here as well, but if you go in the afternoon it is not as bad. There is so much to see so if you want to see (and read) everything you need more than three hours. Be prepared though that many images are quite graphic displaying all the horror that happened."
Thought provoking,A well laid out museum that although it shows graphic details it puts it across in a very sobering manner. Yes it helped end a war but the human losses and the pain involved long term make you ask was it the best way .
"So effective, so heartbreaking ",The photos and exhibits in this museum can break your heart. It's overwhelming but so effectively presented. The images will linger in my mind for many years to come....
Very interesting and disturbing,"Not a happy visit, but a must. My husband says it is like preventive driving course: Makes yiu realize what can happen. With Iran developing the bomb and threatening Israel with anihilation, it us televant as ever."
Thought provoking,A well presented account of what happened informative and should be seen by all to prevent this again
Depressing place perfectly presented,It is worth to visit this place even if you leave in a very sad mood seeing what the bomb had caused. For me best is to see this museum at the end otherwise you have no eyes for the peace park.
The complete silence of the visitors shows the significance,The A-Bomb helped to end the war but the devastation to families and the town is incomprehensible.  You need a couple of hours in the museum and 2 outside in the Peace gardens. I would recommend you visit the museum first thing and then go to Miyajima in the afternoon and then late evening you can walk through the park
Peaceful Museum,"Worth visiting. Every single exhibit tells you how precious your ordinary life is, and makes you think seriously about ""peace"".They say the Pope Francis is scheduled to visit there on Nov. 24 and due to that the opening hours of the museum will be changed.Please check out the web site for more imformation."
A horror never to be repeated,"The Peace Park and museum are definitely a grim reminder of the horrors of WW2. The park is big and spacious enabling the thousands of visitors to spread out but the museum gets very congested. We were there early but still moved through the museum like a ""human sausage"" - not for the claustrophobic! The displays and information provide all the details of the horror of the effects of the H-bomb and its a very sombre experience. Worth a visit but be prepared for the crowds."
Emotional visit ,"The Museum is very well done,  and costs only 400 yen per adult, it will take a couple of hours to truly take it all in.  There is an area which is really graphic and quite harrowing, the individual stories, pictures, personal artefacts and clothing are very moving and emotional.You also learn a lot about the rise of atomic and nuclear weapons, some of the history surrounding the bombing and the efforts to remove these weapons from the world.  There are many exhibits and the museum can be quite crowded,  there are English translations for all the commentary and audio books available as well, there are a lot of school trips and young children around clearly doing projects.The area outside the museum is very peaceful, the school trips conduct their own individual ceremonies at some of the statues and leave behind colourful paper cranes, as a symbol forGlobal peace....."
A must do,Somewhat like Auschwitz it is hard to describe the experience of visiting this museum/memorial. It is so very poignant and reflects well the human cost and tragedy of the a bomb attack.
Disappointed,"After looking at the highly rated reviews on Tripadvisor I expected much more from this museum.For a start it was very crowded and difficult to read articles relating to the exhibits (there is an awful lot of reading in this museum) and secondly, to me, there was no mention of the main reason for dropping the bomb - to bring the Second World War to an end and save the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who would have died if it had continued. It seemed to lay the blame for the exploding the bomb solely on the United States with the Japanese people portarayed as innocent bystanders. Perhaps there should be another museum alongside which remembers the horrors of the Burma Railway (200,000 died in horrific circumstances) or the  Nanking Massacre (250,000 murdered). Perhaps there would then be a more balanced view of why the bomb was dropped and the further atrocities it stopped.Whether or not the second bomb should have been dropped on Nagasaki is an entirely different question and much harder to justify."
Sad? Yes. Haunting? Yes. Worth it? Definitely.,"As a former teacher of young children, I had a very difficult time in the museum because a group of young children were being taken on a tour. These children were seven or eight years old. I am not quite sure why a group this young should be exposed to this. And they seemed totally disinterested. But for teenagers and adults of every culture, this museum is a reminder of what should never be again.Please be warned that this material is incredibly graphic. I have been to many Holocaust museums, and this is one on steroids. That being said, this is very modern and Well laid-out museum is top-notch and getting the message across. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs and artifacts.  Bring tissues."
Everyone should visit,Absolute must.  The human impact of the nuclear bomb should be understood by everyone.  I was moved to tears at several points.It can be very crowded so may be best to try a very early visit to avoid the crush.The history is fascinating and seemed balanced and thoughtful (but I am no expert) which made the whole experience very engaging and utterly thought provoking
Moving,"Busy but as with everything in japan it works. Very moving individual stories of destruction and survival. One perspective only of why it happened and no mention of 1935 onwards in China, Manchuria or elsewhere. Needs to be seen"
A very elaborate and wide-ranging display.,"It covers all aspects of the aftermath of the bomb, with some excellent video and diarama displays.Can be a little repetitive as much of the 'debris' on display is similar. A well laid out museum."
"Incredibly Well Done, Yet Simply Too Much For Me","From what I managed to pull through, the museum is so well done. Unfortunatelly I had to leave after about 15 minutes because it was simply too much to bear. I strongly recommend to think the visit through if you aren't dealing with this kind of stuff well or if you are bringing someone sensitive along.Bringing children is a big no in my personal oppinion. If someone took me here when I was 13 I would been incredibly shaken and have nightmares for years. I am 20 nowadays and going to see the museum was my own decision. It's incredibly emotional and strong but also really graphic.Even though I believe the museum deserves 5 stars, I would still recommend giving it a pass if you are sensitive about stuff like this. It's not worth the emotional hit."
A most captivating museum dedicated to the memory of nuclear bomb and future prevention,"... of nuclear warfare, it is quite breathtaking, very moving and its normal, totally normal to be touched by the pictures and to break into tears.The building is really interesting 60ies archtiecture and Tadao Ando did a mrvelous job here."
Very Interesting,"The museum is definitely worth visiting and does an excellent job presenting a difficult subject and the dangers of a world armed with atomic and hydrogen bombs. The museum contains photos of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb along with photos of the victims that perished and survived, including brief descriptions of their lives. In addition to photos, there are artifacts that were impacted by the bomb such as portions of staircases, bicycles, clothing, bottles, helmets, and wallets to name a few. I visited on a weekday afternoon and the museum was very busy and due to the amount of visitors, there were lines behind many of the exhibits and some were difficult to view due to the amount of people. There were also rooms that were filled with people and movement was at a standstill, so it may be best to visit at non-peak times. Overall, it was a great day here."
A beautiful memorial ,This is a tough place to visit but the memorial are done well and evoke a solemness that is appropriate. The peace flame comes from a fire that has burned for 1200 years.
"Sobering, but well done","This was a very moving and emotional visit.  Important to see, I believe, to help us all understand.  The presentation of the city of Hiroshima before and after the bombing is in the first room and it really makes an impact.The museum displays all kinds of artifacts and clothing and tells stories about the families and people connected to them.  It sure makes it very human, very real, and it really impresses on you the aftermath with the radiation, and the horrible illnesses that people came down with afterward and died.  Just absolutely heart-wrenching.Yes, there are definitely crowds here, but you really can't take everything in anyway, so just pick & choose which displays you view and read about, and be patient."
Moving,"We visited the memorial and must say it was very moving and I was surprised by how much it hit me. I think the Japanese have presented a very good account of what happened in a way that asks the world to remember these horrific events, but in a way that we learn rather than point fingers. I hope we do."
Nuclear bomb,This is an amazing museum devoted to the bombing of Hiroshima The displays and photos are graphic Perhaps I am a cynic but there seems to be poor us and we are now trying for world peace They forget they started it and they were warned
Over crowded,"Although the museum itself is great and very educational, the amount of people let in at the same time completely ruined the experience for us. In addition to at least 5 or 6 different school groups, there were so many people in there it created a jam and we actually got stuck in the entry to one of the rooms. Once in the room it was so packed you could barely see the signs/pictures. It is really a shame and of course many people were complaining. They should really think of creating school day visits only and/or rethink their admission policy."
Easy to find,"Worth the time to visit, easy to find, with the exhibits well documented and researched. Allow 1-2 hours, easy stroll around peace park. Plenty of areas to rest and eat nearby. Can also catch ferry to Miyajima Island."
Very Important Museum ,"Very important and beautifully made Museum. Pictures, stories, horrors of war.Not an easy place and not recommended for young kids.Personally, I think they should have started the story telling from WW2 but anyway this is the most important stop on Hiroshima."
Harrowing Experuence,"This museum is a harrowing experience. It is about the effectof the A bomb. It is seen through the personal impact on people's lives, their families and the longer term impact on individuals and their families. Seen from this perspective the museum is excellent in achieving what it sets out to achieve. That we  must never use such weapons again on civilian populations  There is some context about the war, the Japanese aggression in South East Asia, but this falls short on historical detail about the rationale for the bomb. That is how it should be as that is not the purpose of the museum......"
Rugby Trip,Very interesting place to visit which obviously goes into great detail regarding the dropping of the bomb in 1945. I must say I learned a few things that I wasn’t aware of about the catastrophic incident.Very graphic pictures and details and so not for the faint hearted but well worth a visit.
Brilliant ,"This museum is excellent. I love how they focused on the lost and the survivors instead of the political propaganda and science. It was very touching and impactful.Just note that the stories, pictures and photos are confronting. It was also very crowded when I was there. So claustrophobic people and those affected by war might struggle here.It is only 200¥ entry and well worth the admission fee."
A well presented story of that fateful day and the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima,"We had been warned that this could be quite harrowing, with depictions of everything that happened before, during and after the bomb. Many others have put into words the feelings we had on viewing displays of injured, dead and surviving Japanese, Koreans and American prisoners. On the day we went, in the afternoon,  it was very very busy, with tourists and many school children groups making some of the darer areas within the main area slightly claustrophobic. Go as early as you can, and then take time to visit the gardens including the bell, shrines, eternal flame and of course the “dome”. Take a hanky."
Sombre,It's rare to visit a place that produces deep emotion and tears and for anyone with a soul you will experience this. This museum represents catastrophe on a scale that cannot be imagined or agreed with. Yes there are so many of those around the world but here we have shocking use of power against so many innocent folks. There will be debates about the why but before you make any conclusions and if you can go to Hiroshima or Nagasaki go and decide for yourself. Do not leave Hiroshima without going here it is a hard but beautiful commemoration of the loss and rejuvenation of the human spirit.
Very informative,"Lots of exhibits of personal belongings and story telling.  After awhile I couldn't read any more stories or look at any more pictures, my heart was heavy...  Glad I went..."
Thought provoking ,A visit to the museum and surrounding peace park is a must for any traveller to Japan.The museum does include very graphic images of the aftermath of the atomic bomb explosion so discretion should be used.The museum also doubles as a centre for peace and explores options and opportunities. There is also a history of Hiroshima.Highly recommended
Remarkable place,This is where you will see and remember those years that changed the landscape of the world. This museum made me feel how bad war is bar none. The deaths of the Japanese caused by the atomic bomb lobbed in Hiroshima is unimaginable. The museum has really captured it.
"Well worth a visit, just make sure you get in 2 hours before closing time!","You'll need a couple of hours here to fully appreciate all the information they are providing. The guards start to kick you out 10 minutes before closing so it can feel a little rushed, however we got a good view around the place and learnt so much about before, during and after the atomic bomb. Not a place to take children that's for sure, but very educational for maybe age 15+."
Exceptionally busy,"The museum is excellent, no blame, no criticism, just story telling of an horrendous event that obliterated lives in an instant and led to suffering on an untold scale for years to come.  Very moving, but the experience was not one of quiet contemplation given the place was absolutely heaving with people and especially school parties.  Whilst it is commendable that the schools are totally involved in this experience, a time allocation for entry would seem an essential requisite for all parties in order to better manage the pressure on the exhibits."
Memorable Experience ,"If in Hiroshima take the time to visit this Museum. Some parts of the exhibit are interactive, some are mainly texts and pictures and some donated objects are shown aswell. Its touching and heartbreaking at times but worth a visit for educational reasons. An eye opening experience!"
Very sad and interesting place to visit,"As we all know this is where the atomic bomb was dropped and ended the second world war.nuclear era began with this massive destruction, we should never forget all the innocent people that died august. 1945"
Go Early/Late,"As you'd expect - harrowing, tear-jerking and thought-provoking. They've done well to highlight the human stories after the atomic bomb and link it to modern politics. I'd challenge all politicians to do a tour here before taking office.However, it was absolutely rammed. I suspect a visit is on the school curriculum in Japan and there many bored school kids cramming in with the plentiful tourists. I'd honestly suggest selling tickets so people actually have a chance to see the exhibits. Go at times where you will have the chance."
You Have a Moral Obligation to Visit Here if You are in Hiroshima,"My title says it all: sober, informative, evocative, important. Everyone should have the chance to visit here, and gain an insight into how crushingly indiscriminate and frighteningly devastating an atomic explosion is. This place pulls no punches, as you would expect. It is clear and informative. You must prepare yourself for a harrowing but necessary time here."
"Detailed, emotional, and sobering","It goes without saying, but be prepared to leave with a heavy heart. This museum provides not only an emotional perspective of the aftermath, but also an educational experience on the history and adverse effects of nuclear war."
Very home hitting,Definitely worth the 200yen entry price.... definitely worth the visit. However very hard hitting and emotional. Gives a complete understanding of how terrible wars and nuclear can be. Also very busy but can deal with that
Harrowing and moving. ,Well worth the visit to truly understand the impact of the nuclear bomb. Was very busy which meant it could be a bit slow to move through but the exhibition was very well done. It was good value too.
Extremely sad,"Very sobering to see the devastation caused when the U.S.A. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during the second world war.  Photos, artifacts and some of the surviving people all make this a reminder to the rest of the world that hopefully nothing like this ever happens again."
"Sobering, depressing yet extremely well done","Every Politician in the world needs to see this.  Listened in on English language head set and while crowded with tourists and school trips a truly emotional and important site to see.  Museum was very well organized and extremely well done.  Not morbid, but definitely sobering."
Interesting,Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. This museum was so well put together. Its very hard to look at everything and not be effected. We spoke with a local later who advised the museum was not done for tourists but rather for the Japanese as a reminder of what war brings. I felt hearing that so lost for words and gained so much more respect for them.
Must do in Hiroshima,"The museum has recently been renovated and extended and the exhibits are now well laid out. It was extremely busy and you can’t really read all the information because of that but what you will see is very thought provoking. I was particularly moved by the children’s exhibits.I was also pleased that so many school groups were going through, I guess as part of their curriculum."
Must Visit,A walk through this museum give you a an idea of what it was like after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. There are stories of individual survival and suffering after the bomb drop. Some followed the story of the individual until death. There are artifacts to show the devastation of the bomb. My visit left me thinking that there must be another way to settle our differences besides war.
Brilliant.,Very sad but historically accurate. Shows the suffering of the local community. Very reasonable 200 yen entry and 400 for an audio guide. Would recommend but can have gruesome and difficult imagery so be prepared.
Highly Recommended,"If stopping by Hiroshima, this is a must see museum. It is even worth doing a day trip here from Osaka or Kyoto. There are a lot of stories to hear from survivors. All pretty horrifying to read but it is important that everyone understands their suffering. Plenty of artefacts from that day too.Admission prices are next to nothing and there’s lots to see. So it’s a no brainer and I cannot recommend it enough."
Can't visit Hiroshima without going inside,"We paid $2 admission and walked inside.  The museum was very very crowded, there were groups of all ages from all over the world.  We heard tour guides speaking many different languages, leading somber groups from exhibit to exhibit.  We began by walking through vibrant Hiroshima in 1945.  On the floor in front of us we saw the dropping of the Atomic Bomb and then the devastating aftermath.  This interactive video lasted about 2 minutes, I videotaped this, it's a shame I can't upload video's here.  We moved from room to room, through the devastation of the city, seeing photographs of destruction, pieces of twisted metal and stone left behind.  The steps with the shadow where a person was sitting was memorable.  There were lot's of photographs of people with deformities and physical damage from radiation poisoning.  We saw the lasting physical, emotional and social effects of a society traumatized by the atomic bomb.  A gallery presented the dangers of nuclear weapons.  the design and construction of the Park and Museum, and a commitment to peace.  The museum ended with a resource center, extensive library & small gift shop."
More moving,As per my last review of the childrens park - this is a must visit aswellVery moving and you will be thinking about yourself and mankind a lot - for a few days after thats for sureDo go though lots of interesting exhibts
Sobering,"This is a must see in Japan. It is important to honestly face the reality of decisions made by our country, even though it was the right decision, the horrifying consequences must be faced without hiding from the reality of that decision. I pray it will never happen again, that we as a species will evolve to love all people in their entirety."
Absolutely a must,"This museum is so fantastically designed and set-up to take your through the history of the A-Bomb, Hiroshima and the after effects (both negative and positive) of the bombing. I would highly recommend it and take your time, regardless of how busy it might be to take a look at every aspect of the exhibit."
Crowded,Well set out but visit was frustrating as there is no limit to number of visitors.  Very slow and too many visitors to see the photographs and exhibits Properly - too crowded which spoilt the visit.  You definitely should take the audio guide.  Very sobering and thought provoking
A must see when visiting Hiroshima,We visited for the morning with friends. This museum gives a portrayal of the effects of the nuclear bomb from a local perspective. Many pictures and facts are represented in this large museum. A message of peace is the central theme
Very thought provoking ,"Extremely interesting, very thought provoking, a must on anyones Japanese adventures. It is very well laid out and gives clear information."
Thought provoking ,"This museum is excellent, it leaves nothing to the imagination. In places it is quite graphic, and will probably darken your mood. It is impartial, but leaves no stone unturned.  There are some quite horrific pictures and you can see people quite tearful. A definite must visit"
A really thought provoking experience,"It's amazing how the residents of Hiroshima (where the first nuclear bomb was dropped on humankind) have taken it on board to use the events of August 6th 1945 to strive for peace in the world.This is a really moving experience, telling personal stories as well as the historic chain of events that led to the bomb being dropped and the aftermath.Everyone should go - especially world leaders of countries with a nuclear capability."
Tastefully and beautifully designed,"For the Japanese to exhibit this part of their history and phrase it as ‘ Japan was on the war of path and initiated the conflict’ was reflective of how far they have come since this bombing. Parts of the museum can be confronting with photos of the injuries inflicted. There was a Japanese school group attending as part of their excursion and had to complete homework, thought was a bit confronting for kids under 12 to view the imagery however was important to see how their history is passed onto today’s youth. Entry fee was 200 yen for adults , a time to reflect and listen to stories of those who died or lost loved ones"
Everyone should go,"Not sure that there is a good time to go to the museum, probably after you have seen the beauty of the gardens.It’s one of those places you have to go if only to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.As you go through the museum, everyone is silent, there is a chilling atmosphere as the horror of what the A-bomb did not just in the moment it was dropped but the devastating impact on those who were left and in particular the ongoing deaths of children over the coming years who had been exposed to the black rain."
"So sad, but a must see.","The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museums is newly renovated and a credit to the people that designed and set up this Memorial Museum.You are able to wonder through at your own pace and take in the exhibits that will bring tears to your eyes. Its sad, devastating and certainly makes you think about what these atomic bombs can really do. The exhibits are so well displayed and if you get the chance there is a short movie for about 20 mins to watch.Don't be put off by all of the comments you will read here, it is a must see attraction to visit especially if you have teenage children to learn first hand the horrors that war brings and to the innocent people that are called collateral damage. It will certainly leave a permanent impression on you."
Very impressive,"Well curated, extremely impressive museum about the atomic bomb and it's aftermath. Many personal stories and artifacts of the people living there when it happened"
Moved to tears,"This was one of the most anticipated places during our trip to Japan and it did not disappoint.If you are aware of the picture story called Sadako by Eleanor Coerr, and/or another picture story called My Hiroshima by Junko Morimoto, then this place is a must to visit.Easy to reach from Hiroshima Station. There are two options by public transport: tram or bus, by using your Suica, Pasmo or ICOCA cards (use the North exit from Hiroshima Station). The third option is the hop on/off bus is covered by JR Railpass (use the South exit from Hiroshima Station).Entrance is only ¥200 for adults. My suggestion is to also hire the audio guide for a further ¥400.There are 54 listening posts on the audio guide. Visitors are extremely quiet in the museum, you can almost hear a pin drop. Every now and then, there are a couple of sniffles and a few quiet tears shed, as you listen and read people’s experiences.It is an emotional visit for many people. There is so much history, that should never be forgotten."
Newly renovated and well done,The museum is a good and covers the impact of the bomb and rebuilding. Unlike German memorials there is little reflection on why the situation happened. Truly devastating and impactful take time after to reflect.
Excellent museum,"Extremely informative and sobering place Spend the extra 400 yen for the headsetCan get quite busy and hot so suggest you take a bottle of water ! How the A bomb impacted the children was heart wrenching , showing burnt clothes etc"
Great Museum & Day Out,"A beautifully presented museum that explores the events leading up to, during, and since the Hiroshima bombing. Would recommend the audio guide, too as was very cheap and very informative. A little bit busy when we went so struggled to read everything but if you really wanted to you could. Would also potentially be wary if you have kids that some of it is VERY graphic and horrifying (but that’s part and parcel with what happened!)Definitely worth wandering up the park to see a-bomb dome, too as it’s beautiful and harrowing all rolled into one. Great day out. Informative, thought-provoking, interesting and still fun!"
A must see moving experience ,"Don’t spend any time reading these reviews, just go inside.  They have a well planned and considerate experience awaiting anyone that wants to know about the traumatic devastation from an Atomic bomb."
Thought Provoking,Strange to say visit was excellent being at the sight of such a terrible event. Very Sobering. But also can feel the message of peace.
Pictures from survivors,"Go and see. Yes it's a dark place but it happened. The A-bomb drawings by survivors were so moving. There were no cameras at the time,  so survivors were asked to draw what they remembered. Very powerful and heart wrenching. The museum is dedicated to not repeating history.  Questions from survivors evoke Holocaust questions, e.g. ""Why am I still alive? It must be to tell what happened."""
Worth a visit,It is a reminder on the extreme pain and suffering of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Vivid photos. Emotional stories. Worth a visit to remind ourselves not to repeat history.
So many feelings,"What a museum. There were so many feelings at once when visiting. The horrors of the a-bomb and the distructions of hundreds of thousand lives are so vivid inside the museum and in the paintings that survivals have painted, in the stories and in the remaining clothes, letters and personal belongings. Everyone should really visit this museum."
Incredibly moving,"This place is an amazing tri ute to the past that Hiroshima had to endure. The exhibits, the detail and the information left me both emotional and breathless during my visit. It was also a wake up call to us all that we can never have this happen again. Hiroshima is a must visit on your trip to Japan and the memories from the  museum wil live with me a long time."
Very Well Presented,As part of a tour including the A Bomb Dome and the Peace Park concluded your visit with the Museum. It is extremely well done and presents a completed picture of the the destructive force of the A bomb and it effects on the people. Very moving experience.
Deep sense of sadness,"Everybody needs to come here and meditate on important things in life. Walking through the Museum made me think how easy the ""civilized"" people could commit an act of violence taking away hundreds of thousands of human lives in a few seconds. Today Americans are discussing the ""gun violence"". But, I think most people fail to think that any violence is caused by a failure to follow God's commandments. What we all should be concerned about is not ""gun violence"", ""LGBT rights"", social justice, or elections. We need to be concerned and preoccupied with what God intended for us, and what we should become in His eyes. We need to be preoccupied how to love each other better."
Very moving museum,"Very spacious & well laid out museum. Easy to get around as the route is well sign posted. It was not expensive to get in. Some of the pictures in the exhibition are quite graphic although they are a true reflection of events, they could be upsetting to some people especially children."
Confronting,Absolutely worth a visit. The saddest and most confronting exhibition that I have ever seen. Be prepared for graphic images and heart rendering stories of the victims of the bomb. The design of the exhibition is cleverly done as you walk through very dimly lit areas whilst seeing devastation out into a bright area that overlooks the memorials. Everyone should take a lesson from this
Moving and somber experience ,As you walk through the exhibits which can be confronting for some you can hear nothing but silence apart from people crying from the sheer emotion of what they are seeing. Extremely powerful and for some overwhelming experience but one you must do.
Somber & Memorable place,"It was a very powerful, somber & memorable visits to The Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima.  I always wanted to see this & SO GLAD I did it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to you.  It will be a very stirring & moving experience!"
An incredibly powerful experience.,"Hiroshima, Japan.Monday 6th August 1945. It is 8.15am. The residents of Hiroshima are preparing for a new day. 31,000 feet above them Colonel Paul Tibbets of the U.S. army is flying a Boeing bomber aircraft. It is called the Enola Gay and is named after his mother. A moment later he releases an atomic bomb. It is known as ""Little Boy"". It takes precisely 44.4 seconds from the time it is released to hit the city of Hiroshima. In one single act by a single man 70,000–80,000 people are killed by the blast and the subsequent firestorm. Another estimated 70,000 people will die over the following months. To my mind, it was the most cruel single act of retribution perpetrated on mankind.Nothing can prepare you for the horror and pain suffered by the Japanese people on that day and over the following months and years. Yesterday, when I went to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I certainly wasn't.When I entered the permanent exhibition space my emotions started to rise as I took in the images laid out before me. I had started to take some photographs but I stopped because it felt so wrong. Like I was invading a space in which I had no right to be. The horrific pictures of human suffering are indescribable. There aren't any words at all. The shocking images send you into a kind of numb grief. For people you never knew. In a place you've never been. It is simply heartbreaking. All the more so because this terrible suffering was caused by mankind.I came out of there with tears running down my cheeks. I wasn't the only one. Even now, while writing this I find the same thing happening. It has really stayed with me. And so it should.You won't find any of the images I have described above on this post. However, I have included a small group of photographs taken in the Museum which show some of the devastation. The photographers, many of whom risked there lives, captured some of the key moments after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is through their bravery and their photographs that mean we and future generations will never be allowed to forget.I am so glad I did this. I will never forget my visit to Hiroshima."
Impressive but also sad,"The museum is very good, it gives a comprehensive and very personal overview of the tragedy that happened here. The feeling is so intense that you feel unwell a whole while after."
A must see but prepare its not an easy experience,Definitely a must see when in Hiroshima. The exhibitions are very interesting and the intention is to share manu stories of the victims. The museum is made in a very personal way and is really touching and gets to you. Lots of tourists that makes it a bit difficult to see/read it all.Allow yourself 1-2 hours to go around it
Tough to not feel this deep within yourself.,"While touring, you will see the devastation wrought by man's evil inventions.  Many may feel it was a necessary evil, I'll not argue that.  However, when you're standing quietly side-by-side with Japanese tourists (and yes, it's very quiet and respectful), it's hard not to realize, folks are folks.  They were busy doing what they thought right, as were we.  Heartbreaking."
"A sober, but extremely interesting visit","The museum does a wonderful job of showing the impact that the atomic bomb had, not only for those directly impacted by the bomb, but also by the hundreds and thousands of people who tried to help those in need after the bombing. Between the museum and the nearby monuments including the A Bomb Dome we left feeling dispirited about man’s capacity for inhuman acts, but hopeful that places such as this will help to ensure there is never a repeat!"
Excellent museum ,Given the history of Hiroshima this museum is always going to be sobering but it was informative and unbiased. I would definitely recommend visiting but lots would be difficult for young children to see as there are many upsetting images.
eye opener to reality,"Happy that we finally made it to Hiroshima, it was so detailed everyone has learnt in history about the World War and the bombing of japan..here you are actually seeing what happened in 1946 ..the bombing of Hiroshima. The graphics of the explosion is so well done , the photos , the collections of the aftermath of the result, and everything is well detailed. The Bento Box and the Origami factuals is heart rendering.A Bomb explanation is commendable, one learns so much visiting a museum."
Fascinating but crowded,"A fascinating museum that tells the stories of the people of Hiroshima during the atomic blast. Very cheap and all the displays include an English translation beside them.The first half of the museum is sombre and includes lots of items (including the belongings of children) caught up in the blast to tell the story of the day and the aftermath. Very quiet so probably not suitable for small children.The second half told the story of the development and use of the nuclear bomb and about nuclear proliferation. I understand that the museum is dedicated to the abolition of nuclear weapons but this section didn’t feel completely objective. I suspect that historians would question some of the information, which doesn’t quite tell the whole picture and suits the museum’s agenda. Still fascinating to see though if you keep that caveat in mind.The museum is very crowded, especially the first half so prepare to wait to see all the items in each area."
Thought provoking ,Interesting and moving placeA bit crowded Personalised narrative of the victims familyA sense of the gravity and sadness that this was required to end a war
A must-see experience,"This is perhaps one of the most moving experiences we had during our Japanese holiday. The Atomic Dome, Peace Park and Museum are all captivating, with many deeply personal stories and reflections. There is an audiovisual display that gives a depiction of the bomb dropping which depicts Hiroshima both before and after the event which is extremely thought-provoking and intense. If you travel to Japan you must visit this site - you will not be disappointed."
Riveting beyond words ,"This was a place we just had to visit since we saw the film, Rhapsody in August, some two decades ago. The Atomic Dome, the Peace Park and the Museum were deeply moving to see and to reflect upon. The exhibits in the museum made the story very tangible. The stories of the survivors were very depressing. And some of the quotes on the wall moved us to tears. And the simulation of the bombing drive home the message that nuclear bombs should be banned."
"Very touching, a must see",This is a must place in Hiroshima. Prepare to be touched by the horrific personal stories of victims and relatives of the first atomic bombing.
Must see,If you are in Hiroshima you must come to this museum. If you are in Japan you should come to this museum.
Must visit museum,Good museum with lots of details and facts. But not very organised with too many tourists. Long queue for ticket.
Hiroshima,Wow. What a truly memorable experience. An incredible museum capturing so much emotion and truth. I learnt a lot. The memorials all around the park are also amazing. Highly recommend. One of the best museums I’ve ever been to.
Very poignant. とても心が痛い。,"Very well laid out. Brought me to tears on more than one occasion. I think every would leader should visit this place before they are allowed to govern a country. Putin, trump, kim jong un take note! No more Hiroshimas!非常によくレイアウトされています。 何度か涙を流した。 国を統治する前に、すべてのリーダーがこの場所を訪れるべきだと思います。 プーチン、トランプ、キム・ジョンウンは注意してください！ これ以上の広島人はいません！"
Ridiculously overcrowded avoid,No doubt this is a good museum but avoid it at peak times. We could literally hardly move in some displays due to the massive crowds and it was hot. I could barely see the displays. I think it is dangerous to crowd so many people in. This museum would be good if it was properly managed. All the way from Ireland and I leave Hiroshima disappointed.
Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"We were not sure what to expect, but this made us cry.  You see the history, people, artifacts, and notebooks.  It tells the story of what happened after and how people lived and survived.  It talked about radiation and it's effects.  There were a lot of field trips / Japanese students going here so it can be quite crowded.  Still, you see some of them crying and their friends comforting them.  It was very touching to learn how they survived.  It ends with the hope that peace will endure."
Well done museum,This museum was very well done.  It was just so hard to go through it.  We cried a lot.  It was good for our teenage children to understand what had happened but I don't think I would have taken them if they were younger.  It is definitely a place you should visit and respect but be prepared to cry and definitely do something calming afterwards.
"Well done Museum, however...","This museum is a must for historical purposes. It really gives you the perspective of what occurred in Hiroshima when the A-bomb was dropped during WW2. The story it told of the people it affected really makes you feel for them.  I have been to this museum once before in October 2000 and it has changed drastically, but for the better.  I brought the kids here so that could be aware of effects of the A-bomb.  I would give the museum a 5 rating but it was soooooo over crowded that you could not see everything.  We were there in the afternoon and the number of school kids on their field trip walking through the museum was absolutely insane.. we were packed in like sardines and it was difficult to move to the next story placard or artifact because the kids would just stand there talking or filling out their class forms.. I know that this is a worthwhile museum so may I suggest going early in the morning when it opens so that you can avoid the crowds.."
So peaceful,This is a place you must visit. So many people had died and hope will not happen again anywhere in the world.
Hiroshima Peach Memorial,This is a very busy place.    Much to see and very depressing.    There are many pictures and diaramas to see.
Respectful and important,"The museum is a strong reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons. The main exhibit focuses on the bombing of August 6th, 1945 and the effect on the people of Hiroshima. Which was horrible. Be aware that the exhibit can evoke strong emotions with photos and portrayals of the aftermath of the bombing. The exhibit was very well laid out, with no music, which added to the seriousness of the items on display. I strongly recommend to go here to get some insight into the event that most people think about when they hear the city's name."
Emotional ,The whole peace memorial park is a great place to visit and it promotes contemplation and respect.  It’s right in the heart of the city and easy to find. The shrine and memorial are both close to the Promotion building (the remnants of the building closest to the blast centre). A must see visit in my opinion
Horrifying,"The world of today needs museums like this, as we need to understand our past to do our best for the future. There are other horrifying things we need to remember, like Holocaust, Pearl Harbor etc, which also have important memorials.The horrors of the atomic bomb are unbelievable, and are particularly well described at this museum.Very disturbingly, fact is that at the moment there are more than 16.000 atomic bombs in the world, and that these weapons are in the hands of very few countries.I hope that the leaders of those countries have seen this museum!"
Very Important and Disturbing Museum,"I spent 3 nights in Hiroshima as I wanted to take my time when I was visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial sites.  I worked in the Nuclear Power industry when I was working and I realize that a lot of the knowledge that we have on radiation exposure came from the data on the Japanese bombings.  I used the HOHO bus that is included in the JR pass to get to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  It is 200 yen to get into the museum.  This museum is a must see.  The museum carefully documents what happened to the civilian people before, during and after the bombing occurred. I spent about 3.5 hours going through the museum and afterwards I felt ill because of what happened.  Since these were the first nuclear bombs that were dropped, no one knew what the effects of so much radiation would do to the people exposed to it. Many people thought that they would be OK when they survived the initial effects of bombing only to die from the long term effects of the radiation.   The devastation of the landscape was total.  The majority of the original buildings (except for the Atomic Bomb Dome) were wooden and they were totally destroyed.  There was nothing left after the bombing.  This has allowed Hiroshima to be completely rebuilt and the city is now beautiful.  However, we must not forget the affects of the nuclear bomb.I recommend that everyone that can afford to go to Japan and visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki visit the Memorial Museums."
Haunting,We spent a couple of hours visiting today. The photos and stories of the people that lost their lives were quite haunting. It gives a better perspective of what the people endured. Great tribute
Great museum,"Walked here from the Dome.  Paid the Y200 --no JR pass here.The artifacts they have gathered are incredible.  There is so much to see and read here.  This is worth so much more than the entrance fee they charge.Outside this museum, you can catch the loop bus going back to the station."
Thorough narrative of all the events,"This museum contains an amazing collection of articles, artifacts, photos, narratives, computer simulations, and actual objects recovered from the atomic blast back in 1945 and these provide visitors with a thorough chronological account of all the events that took place just minutes before and during and immediately afternoon the explosion, and also the aftermath. Very well done and vivid such that I felt as though I was there experiencing the horror.  The entire experience was really somber but necessary. The price of admission was affordable - ¥200 (about US$1.85 and €1.65) per adult at time of visit. Students pls present your student ids for student discounts. Worth every penny."
Eye opener!,"It's amazing how after so long this place still has such a strong feeling of pain and remembrance. The way the museum is arranged and the detail of everything, you would be hard done not to bring a tear to your eye. Great to experience something like this to give you hope and strength to see humanity can be cruel but with love and hope you can prevail."
Imperative visit for every adult.,This well set out museum is dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. It is a harrowing story and not suitable for young children. I found the information and photographs quite disturbing but I think every person and particularly our world leaders should visit and see what happened on 6th August 1945 and the impact it had on this city.
Harrowing,"Keen that we should visit Hiroshima it’s hard to avoid the past and the horrors of war.  Not just the war but the aftermath and the lack of support given to the Japanese here.There were many stories of death and survival. The shock was how many passed away in the period directly after the nuclear attack.If anyone thinks that war is justified, please visit the museum and peace park.  Enough said."
Excellent museum,"What a fantastic museum. There is so much information laid out in a really interesting and informative way with lots of good little videos, lots of pictures etc. It's really well done. Hard to believe the devastation that was cause here.we spent about 3 hours here and could have spent more. It closes at 6pm. We got the city loop bus from Hiroshima station which we used our JR pass on, very handy."
Impressive and depressing,"Despite the crowds, there’s virtually no noise. People are locked in their own thoughts. The feeling is similar to that of the Holocaust museum. The focus is very much on the ordinary people of Hiroshima - and the suffering they endured, not the politics of the time. Looking around the city now, less than 75 years since the Bomb was dropped, it’s hard to believe what a wasteland it was, in the immediate aftermath. This gives a sense. The stories of the black rain, in particular, will stay with me."
Impressive and Heartbreaking,"This museum is a critical part of Hiroshima and not to be missed.  Even our teenage boys who are unimpressed with everything put down their cell phones long enough to immerse themselves in the exhibits.  Personally, I am so touched and impressed by the resiliency of this city and its people to rise from the ashes and build this museum by the early 1950s.  War is devestating, and yet Hiroshima rebuilt and its people will never forget.  You can do this museum in about an hour.  But definitely take time to see various part of the Memorial Park.   Things to note:  If your children are 14 or under, they get in free.  And while it was suggested to us to get the audio guides, they are NOT necessary.  Everything you hear is written out in English throughout.  And finally at end of exhibits, there's a peace petition that you can fill out that will be taken to the U.N. (or something like that).  Makes you feel like you're a part of something bigger."
Important museum,Visiting the museum was a powerful experience. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone visiting Japan.
Astonishing ,Great place to remember a horrible day in Hiroshima’s history. Definitely must see. A lot of memories of people who suffered
"Somber, uncomfortable but a must go","Currently going through seismic upgrades. It does what museums are supposed to do.  Inform and provoke discussion. We took friends from China with us, who has heard of an atomic bomb but never understood the scope of damage and the horror inflicted.The children, five and eight year old, were wide-eyed throughout the exhibition.  I was concerned that it might frighten the children but it did not however it brought a torrent of questions about the incident. Caveat - discernment is needed whether children can cope with the photos.I was personally surprised at the amount of tears we saw among the visitors.This exhibit is done very well.  It personalizes the event, we feel empathy for the victims.  The exhibition is in Japanese and English.  There is an audio tour guide available for a fee, I am hesitant to call this a ""dark tour"" because it is far more than sensationalizing a horrible historical incident but it really emphasis the horrors of atomic weapons and it's real world effects.A must see while in Hiroshima."
This Will Move You,This museum give a human face to the tragedy of the atomic bomb. Reading first hand accounts of this event was very impactful.
Important,"When tragedy happens, the easy thing to do is the shy away from it. The people of Hiroshima have done the hard work for you and preserved the experiences of their relatives and loved-ones and placed them in a safe place to be seen and better understood. Yes, it is heavy and sad, but you need to visit it in order to understand the horrific strength humanity has in causing devastation but also the strength it has in restoring hope."
Personalizing the Atomic Blast,"This museum accomplishes it’s goal to remind us of the people whose lives were affected. With many photos, quotes, pictures, and personal items, the horror of this event was brought to life. Near the end of the one way walk through the museum was an interesting display chronicling how the atomic bomb was developed, the politics around that time, why Hiroshima was chosen, and the current state of atomic weapons in this world."
Must see if you're in Hiroshima,"This museum focuses primarily on the innocent victims of the Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Roughly 90% of the victims were nonmilitary. They don't spend too much time talking about the US and Japanese governments or how we got to the events of August 6, 1945. The primary purpose of this museum is to remember the innocent victims caught in the awful firestorm. It's a very emotional experience, well worth the trip to Hiroshima."
Museum ,Very informative and good value. Most transcripts in English as well as Japanese. Some harrowing stories of the effects of the atomic bomb.
Must See,"This was one intens museum to visit, it's super heavy, but shows why world peace is needed. Anyone who comes to Hiroshima should go here, be amazed and be humble. You'll need at least 2 hours to see it all, but I personally rushed through it a bit on the end.. it's quite a lot to see, and a lot is repeated.. but the important thing is that it details on the lives during and after the events. Please go here if you have the chance."
Excellent and graphics displays,This place is a telling depiction of the tragedy of A-Bomb. A fascinating way of showing the devastation and educational to a point that you will loathe all the nuclear warfare activities. Simply outstanding and you will Tear up
Worth Visiting,"Mention museum to me and I fail to get excited. However, as this building dominates the Peace Park you may as well take a look.My advice. Don't miss it. Full of remnants of the atomic bomb blast, clothes, toys etc.You will never forget it and you will be anti-nuclear forever"
Great museum - would change a few things if I went again,"The Peace Memorial Museum is definitely a must-see in Japan, and much can be learnt from the displays. It's a humbling place which captures the horror of nuclear warfare and also details the sequence of events leading to deployment from the Allies.That said, if I had to go again, I would give the following advice to myself.1. Don't take the audio guide. It's not very expensive, but I felt that it didn't add much. The narrators voice reads the first few lines from the display, and sometimes adds a bit more detail, but hardly much to engage on. If you're a quick reader you're better off skipping this to engage with the text and visuals more, without the distracting audio2. Don't go to the survivor's memorial lecture. I'm not sure what the exact name is, but it's an English presentation of about 45min in which a lady whose mother and schoolteacher survived the A-bomb detail their stories. I felt like I would rather have spent the time going slower through the museum then listening to the stories3. If you can (museum personnel might be a bit directive and force you to go the other way) I would start with the history leading up to the deployment, and then go to through the after effects area. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of these sections, but I do know that the normal flow of the museum is against this recommendation. I suppose it's all a matter of personal opinion."
You Will Never Forget...,"...which is really the point the museum is trying to make. It presents the dropping of the bomb and its aftermath, and their effect on the population. Virtually everything on display has descriptions in English as well as Japanese, and headsets can be rented in other languages too. The projected depiction of the dropping of the bomb is especially excellent, and appears to move.Out the window you can look across the Memorial Park to the Atomic Bomb Dome.You should visit the Dome building, the memorial park and museum together; all are within walking distance of each other, and all can be reached on the hop-on, hop-off buses."
A must visit to make sure we never forget....,"There is so much more to this site than the Peace Dome, which is very moving in its own right.  Make sure to take time to walk the grounds and to see the Peace Mound, where all the unidentifiable cremated bodies were buried, the Peace Bell, and the Children's Memorial.  The underground memorial with photos of the destruction from October 1945 on the walls is a perfect time for reflection.Collectively, a very sobering experience that should be seen by all if we are ever going to give peace a chance.Easy to take the Shinkansen from Kyoto as a self-guided day trip to witness thishistorical site."
Moving experience without blame,"Truly moving experience explaining, in a high-tech, innovative way, what happened during the bombing and the aftermath. While it does talk about how the Americans planned the bombing, it very obviously avoids any explanation or information as to why Japan was bomb (so for the uninformed, it would seem like Japan was randomly bombed and to that I would say do some unbiased historical research from the American and Chinese point of view during WWII).Nonetheless, it’s a well done tribute to the sadness of war and, unlike the Vietnam War Museum in Saigon (which placed pure blame angrily on Americans), the Japanese gave a more somewhat more neutral presentation of what happened, certainly less angry,  and concludes with wishes for this never to be repeated. This is not to be missed."
A Remarkable Place,"We have visited many museums in our travels over the years but I have to say that this is the best, and most moving place I have ever visited. I was born just after the events of Hiroshima and it is so hard to believe that this could happen. The attitude and belief of the people today is to be admired. No apparent animosity just the hope and prayers that nothing like this will happen again. We visited the museum during Golden Week and with the great numbers of people did not get the chance to spend as much time as I would have liked to looking at the exhibits, photos etc. I would love to go back one day to take more in."
If  you   care  about  life  and people   then  this  city  is  a MUST,I  have  wanted  to  visit  JAPAN  for many  years  and I  now  have  made it  twice now  with  more  planned  visits. Hiroshima  has   been in my  thoughts  for many  years  and  I  new  I  would  visit when  I  got  here  and  I  am  so very   glad  I  did.  Its  amazing  city when  you  consider it  was virtually  Destroyed by  THAT  BOMB.The  Museum will  make  you  sad  its  HEARTBREAKING  to  understand  what  happened  here  But  its  Very  important  to  come here  and  feel  it. Schools  come  here  I  saw  many  groups  visiting.  There   has  been  a   Great  deal  of  care  to  build these  Museums  and  the  Japanese people  are  very  caring so  I  will  be  visiting again  next  year  2020
Simply Superb,"This is an incredibly moving experience. It's not often a Museum will shock you or move you as much as this one. Its fascinating too as it documents Hiroshima before, during and after the Atomic Bomb detonation. Some very arresting displays of photos of victims and their burns, the dead, the fused bottles and incinerated lunchboxes, a tricycle, charred clothing and a myriad of charred or melted possessions. There's a model of the Atom Bomb dropped here and the one dropped on Nagasaki, a bronze cast of the Atomic Bomb Dome before and after and just huge dreds of fascinating and heartbreaking stories from victims. The display on the little girl behind the Children's Monument is heartbreaking.Get the audioguide, it's brilliant. I spent hours in here, just an absorbing, horrifying, interesting and moving  experience.An absolute must do. One of the best museums I've ever been to."
Conflicted,"The museum was absolutely beautiful and very well designed- I wish we had similar ones in Australia. However, the story was told from the Japanese perspective and this can be difficult to understand if you had family or friends who fought. Would highly recommend, but suggest keeping this caveat in mind."
Thought provoking ,This is the major attraction in Hiroshima and probably why you are here or going so it goes without saying it's a must see. Very thought provoking but be aware also very confronting which is the point. The focus on the local children will leave an impression.I think no matter when you go it's going to be busy with either tour groups or school groups. If you just go with the crowd and take your time you'll get to still appreciate the care and thought put into the museum.
"Excellent museum, with an important message","The horror and heartbreaking real life stories of victims and survivors of the A-bomb are sensitivity told through exhibits and artefacts. However, most importantly, the museum carries an important message about the vital need for nuclear disarmament to avoid a similar tragedy ever happening again. A visit to this museum is sobering, but essential for anyone visiting the city."
Evocative,"The Peace Memorial and Museum is extremely evocative with an array of well presented artefacts, testimonies and photographs supported with interactive screens which allows each user to explore those aspects of the memorial and event to their own level. The building itself is stylish in a quiet understated way with the peace garden adjacent making the whole visitor experience memorial and thought provoking."
Moving and emotional,"If you are traveling w/ children 10 years old or younger, you should prepare them for the exhibits.  There were a lot of school children ~ ages 10-12 on field trip.  We saw a few students crying and their teacher had to escort them out of the exhibit.  A worthwhile education thoroughly covering the history of the atomic bombing.  Allow at least a 2-3 hours visit.  They close at 5pm.  There is a small snack bar area in the lobby to rest and refresh as well as a small gift shop."
Beautiful museum ,We really enjoyed our visit the this museum. It was well laid out and we learnt heaps about the atomic bomb of hiroshima. Very sad but a very informative museum.
Everyone should see this museum,"We wanted to know more about the bombing and this was perfect. Maps, a great video (personal survivor stories), mementos (clothing) and affecting stories of loss, bravery....not to be missed. Makes a definite argument for world peace (esp nuclear disarmament)."
Memorable,"See written review for further details. All in all a great and modern way to commemorate the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, that fateful morning of August 6th 1945."
Beautifully done memorial - a sombre experience,"Very moving memorial with well-considered exhibits and stories. The beginning of the museum starts with an aerial projected map of Hiroshima city and provides an insight into the devastation and extent of damage on that fateful day, and is a perfect lead into the rest of the museum.The surrounding memorial park with the Atomic Bomb Dome and Children’s Peace Monument is also thought-provoking and a good place to reflect on the horrors of war and the everlasting hope for peace."
Powerful,Some of the exhibits can be quite upsetting including clothing & personal effects worn by the victims.We had a private talk with a Hiroshima survivor who told us her sad story. She was 8 years old & was only 3km from the hypocentre & she very open discussing that day & her life up to the present. We did get to hear from both sides of the story having visited Pearl Harbour a few years ago. Highly recommended.
An amazing museum,"There were lovely volunteers at the museum who approached you to explain the different artefacts and items that you are looking at. They helped make sense of what you were looking at.The displays at the bottom level was truly inspiring. You see all the items that the citizens had donated to the museum, each with a story to tell. All with the hope that the future generations will remember that such a thing must never happen again. Such amazing spirit."
So much history,Such a nice place to visit and see the history. such a nice park area. great place to spend an hour or so walking around
A brilliant illustration of the horrors experienced by Hiroshima victims,"An incredible collection of artifacts from the atomic bomb attackon Hiroshima in 1945. Bottles, ceramics and metal items fusedtogether by the intense heat. The stone step from the SumitomoBank, with the shadow of a customer, waiting for the bank to open,all that remained of him as he was vapourised in the explosion. Thetiny child's tricycle, whose owner did not survive.There are many stories told of those who lived beyond the bombingonly to die during the following 15 years of cancer caused by theradiation.The collection of recovered items is a vivid testimony to the horrorsexperienced by the residents of Hiroshima. The before and afterphotographs show the sheer devastation caused.Hiroshima has adopted a very positive attitude and the emphasis isnot on the rights or wrongs of the past, but to promote peace.Let us hope that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and last toexperience such extreme suffering.."
Powerful,"The museum houses a stunning collection of artifacts associated with the bombing of Hiroshima, and the devastating aftermath. Parts of it may be difficult to go through because the museum doesn't shy away from showing how the blast directly affected the human body. And if you are an American, please don't be ""that guy"" loudly arguing to your companions that ""it had to be done in the interest of the greater good"". I found it extremely distasteful to bring that up while surrounded by evidence of so much suffering, pain, and death. Don't be that Ugly American stereotype!"
Moving exhibits,Exhibits were well presented and moving.  The first part of the museum tells the stories of people who experienced the atom bomb. The latter part explained the historical context and a little of the science. Well worth visiting.
A 'must see' while in Hiroshima,"This Museum gives you an insight into what occurred to the Japanese civilians during the last stages of WWII when the A-bomb was dropped. The photos are chilling and very emotive, but when you read the stories it really hits you. Some people were actually sobbing. It's a slow queued walk through the museum. Also interesting was the details of how the bomb worked and some of the letters written about how the sites were selected. We spent about 2+ hours here. It's worth seeing the remains of the 'dome' building before the museum to appreciate the how the bomb annihilated the area."
 Very touching and informative ,The purpose of the museum was to raise awareness of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb dropped on the city.  It was very impactful and you left feeling sad for the victims and fearful that this can occur in the future. It hopes that such awareness will hopefully make people supportive of efforts for nuclear disarmament and everlasting peace.  It certainly accomplished its objective with me.
Dark but important,Absolutely worth seeing once in your life if you ever visit Hiroshima.The peace parc and museum are both very informative and you can also even touch some of the original pieces of houses that are from that time.Be prepared to get emotional though as it is nothing for weak nerves and it will make you see the events in an en even darker light.
Required viewing,"The museum handles a difficult subject exceptionally well. The content is perfectly balanced: a range of fact and emotion, covering all aspects. It's hard to see how a museum could cover this in a better way. Highly recommended for all ages and everyone should learn something."
Well worth the visit,If you want to understand the impact of atomic bombs this is the place to learn.   You are guaranteed to leave a little different to when you arrived.   Outline graphically the consequences.
Worth visiting,"My husband and I visited this place with G Adventure as a guided tour. The guide took us on the bus. So easy and quick to get in. So easy to get around and literally see and read everything to fully understand what went on. There are posts to read, pictures to see, illustrative material from real time. Very moving and extremely sad. Toilets on every corner. Vending machines for drinks. Nice cafe and gift shop. The area outside is also worth visiting. You must visit this museum ."
"Brilliant, but slightly ruined ","I’m going to echo the sentiments precisely of the previous review on TA. The exhibition itself is superb; thought provoking, moving, educational. But the museum needs to address its entrance policy. Literally over a thousand school kids were let in at the same time. It was, at times, literally impossible to move. The museum really needs to allow such groups on a time slot basis. We waited for them to all move through the museum (which they did at quick speed without really looking at anything) before we resumed our visit. Such a shame as it’s otherwise brilliant. Perhaps the key is to arrive at the start or very end of opening hours...?"
A very moving experience,"A very well laid out museum, only recently opened when we visited.  Very clearly laid out and tells the story so well.  Unfortunately when we visited it was also the time for thousands of school children to also to visit and it was so crowded we were unable to walk around and it felt unsafe.  Out of school visits I am sure it would be amazing"
Sad,Very clearly exhibits the tragedies of war.  Allow several hours for this museum if you want to read all the posted stories.  Definitely need to rent the audio guide.
Japan Holiday 2019,"The museum has graphic photo's and stories from survivors of the atomic bomb blast.You can become quite emotional looking at the photo's, and reading some of the stories from the survivors, but they are a must to read.If you go to Hiroshima you have to come here to see the destruction, of the bomb. But most of all the courage of the people to rebuild not only their city, but their lives."
A must,An Absolute must. to see the true reality behind the stories we were all taught in school. A glimpse inside the account of the people who went through this atrocious act and to see past the american propoganda to hide it.
Every visitor should catch this amazing museum,"While sobering in its images of devastation, there emerges a feeling of how courageous and resourceful the people were in rebuilding their city after such a cataclysm."
Very solemn,The museum was reopened at the end of April and we had the opportunity to visit. The museum is a hard visit as are all things related to war. It is sobering and redeeming.
Interesting and graphic,"Museum was extremely busy, tourists and schoolchildren packing it out. The pictures and items they have on show are quite graphic but absolutely relevant and shows the reality. As someone else already wrote, there are two sides to the story and there is a very brief mention to what Japan did at Pearl harbour. Also very interesting part showing the history and development of nuclear and hydrogen bombs.Absolute must if visiting Hiroshima."
Worth a visit,"Wow very confronting, I wasn’t born in 1945 and only heard about it from television docos. We listened to a brilliant talk from an A bomb survivor, it was her perspective of what happened and she was able to draw what she actually saw.  I shall never forget her passion for peace in the world.  This is full on and I really think worth a visit."
All politicians should see this,"We were near the end of an 8-day bus tour of Japan. An optional tour on the bullet train to Hiroshima was available. To see the miraculous recovery of a destroyed city and landscape, was well worth it, but the Peace Memorial Museum is something I think everyone on earth should visit, especially the politicians who hold the fate of the world in their hands. We shared the day with many school groups, who were visibly touched by what they saw, as were we. The displays were sensitively done, though nothing was left out or glossed over. Many visitors were in tears. This was the last thing on our agenda for the day, having spent a few hours already, walking around the large area devoted to memorials and landmarks. Something I never imagined that I would do, was to walk where the bomb had exploded. Nowadays, there is no more radiation in Hiroshima than there is in any other part of the world."
Must see!,"I think it's one of these places everyone should visit at least once in their life. We all learn about Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the horror of the atomic bombings at school, but here, with all of these photographs, stories and survivors artwork* it takes that knowledge to a completely new level. At some point it gets more personal, you can actually feel how horrifying it was. I spent over 3 hours in the museum and was so affected that I couldn't stop thinking about it for the next few days. Apart from the contents, the interesting thing about this museum is that the entry fee is ridiculously small (200 yens). Thanks to that even more people are able to see it. I really appreciate that policy.* There is a whole collection of survivors artwork from the day of the bombing on the very end the exhibition path, just near the exit - it was the most disturbing and devastating thing I have ever seen in my life. Don't miss it!"
Must See,I usually don’t post reviews on sightseeing only hotels but on this occasion I will. This Museum is everything you would imagine and then more. So tastefully done with photographs of survivors mixed with paintings drifting the scenes from the survivors point of view. I was moved from the moment I walked in and can only congratulate everyone involved in this place - it was the highlight of my trip to Japan and just so tastefully done. Peace ✌️
Smaller than expected but very informative,"The museum was very well made and the fee was very reasonable. We liked the exhibitions, especially the first one explaining about the US atomic bomb programs and testing prior to the bombing of Hiroshima. They also have exhibits about people’s injuries and the effects from radiation. The one thing that was missing for us was explanation about the clean-up efforts and how long it took to rebuild afterwards."
No more Atomic bomb please!!!,"History was right before my eyes as I walked through this Museum looking at all photographs and exhibits. My heart went to the innocent folks who perished especially the many innocent school children. Any kind of War should never have happened, revenge & retaliation belong to the evil ones!  This Museum is with good info for us to visualise what happened on 6 Aug 1945! Peace to the World, everyone can do a part!"
Key destination in Hiroshima,A detailed explanation of what happened when and after the bomb was dropped. It’s at times harrowing but if you’re in Hiroshima this is a must-see. The animation showing before and after is particularly shocking. If you take kids be aware that they may find some images scaring.Why not 5 stars? The museum does not explain the context of the war and focuses only on the victims of the bomb. I felt that they should have included information to explain why the Allies felt it necessary to use this awful weapon.
Must see,"The museum does a very good job sharing what happened on the day of the bombing and the time afterward.  As one can expect, there was very little about the Japanese aggression that ultimately led to the bombing. I was somewhat troubled by the storyline that the bombing occurred in part to justify the bomb's $2 B development  cost and the need to give private sector developers a return on their investment.  Also, the so-called 'guest workers' from Korea and China who also died was troubling too as they were essentially captive prisoners forced to work in the factories.  All that said, it is worth visiting this museum but it is also important to be informed about the perspectives of others too."
Very moving,"This museum is very moving, what man can do to man, awful.My visit was overwhelming sad , the museum  is well set out and informative. The surrounding Peace. park full of memorials also moving.. every visit to Hiroshima should include going around this area."
Eye Openning and Inclusvie for Blind Visitors,"This museum really brings to life the magnitude of the atomic bomb's impact on Hiroshima. You are not only presented with the statistics, which are mind-blowing, but real examples, wome of which can be touched. The before and after of a roof tile and blasted bottle made an impression on me.There were also real stories of survivers, from that day.There are signs with information around the museum, which my partner read to me, but with the number of visitors this was difficult and we should have had the audio guide.Of all the cities we visited in Japan, i feel Hiroshima was the most important for me."
"Not to be a victim, but to be a fighter.","This Museum was originally considered as the main part of the Peace Park. The architect of the Museum and the Park as a whole Kenzo Tange made the Museum deliberately simple to strengthen the impact of the exhibition. Despite the fact that I came prepared, the exposition is still amazing. This is an emotionally difficult visit. The day before, we were in a similar Museum in Nagasaki. The authors of the exposition faced a difficult task: to condemn the atomic bombing, but not to fall into the justification of Japanese militarism. Excessive political correctness... The atrocities of the Japanese military in the Dutch West Indies and Burma, or the massacre of Nanjing in 1937, don`t justify the use of atomic bombs against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The American command didn`t bomb these cities specifically to achieve a ""clean effect."" Yes, the headquarters of the 2nd Japanese army was in Hiroshima and was one of the goals of the bombing. But only ""one of."" By the way, the commander of the 2nd army Shunroku Hata was alive, and even appeared in the dock at the Tokyo international Tribunal. Such is the effectiveness of the bombing of the areas... But the main goal - terror against civilians was achieved. 145,000 Hiroshima residents died immediately or died in terrible agony from radiation and radioactive contamination until the end of 1945. Another 50 thousand hibakusha died after... The creators of the Museum showed the main purpose of the bombing is very simple. Sculpture - a gift of English Coventry is in the Museum. This city bombed by the Nazis on November 14, 1940, became a symbol of barbarism and terror, along with the Spanish Guernica. And courage and fortitude of citizens. That's probably the main thing. Not to be a victim, but to be a fighter. I missed this at the Museum. How to return to the ashes, how to restore the city in just 10 years, how to get up from his knees. After all, you can only fight for peace on straight legs."
Heartbreaking look into victims experiences.. everyone should see this.,"I found Hiroshima to be a beautiful city! But as we entered the peace park to head to the memorial, as beautiful as it is, it feels heavy.. the whole area still has a sadness about it that is palpable. On entering the museum you are immersed straight away by walking into a circular room with floor to ceiling images of the destroyed city right round you, it is a hard hitting start. From then you see testimonials and the haunting art made by survivors. The burned/melted objects and clothes. The children’s possessions. I found it heartbreaking and was moved to tears very early on, I found it a difficult experience but one I think everyone should have. Many reviewers say this museum plays the ‘victim card’ and is propaganda.. Yes there is very little mentioned about the Japanese military actions before this atrocity, and yes it does make Japan appear an innocent nation minding its business when suddenly attacked without warning.. BUT!! THIS. STILL. HAPPENED. To civilians, women, children. Horrific hideous things that lasted for many years. Look at it as a museum about the effects of the a-bomb on the people.. and pray to whatever god you believe in that it wont happen to you!"
"Sobering experience, worth the visit","We specifically came to Hiroshima to visit the peace park and museum, it was very easy to get here on the Sightseeing loop bus, stops pretty much out the front.The day we went was relatively busy but manageable, definitely recommend getting the guide as it was hard to read some of the information due to the number of people. The museum is very quite as everyone moves through the rooms (very well put together). Some of the pictures are pretty confronting, a very moving experience.You do need a couple of hours here. but well worth doing."
Tragic !!,"I was deeply touched by my visit . Crowds representing many nations walked around in almost total silence as they viewed the display and read the accounts of suffering and loss . I had a wonderful visit to Japan and it would not have been right to return home without visiting Hiroshima and paying my respects.A  touching history lesson and  a stark reminder of the horrors of war. For me, the paper crane will always be a symbol of courage  !"
Well done,"Impressive exhibit showing Hiroshima before the bomb and then again after the bomb.  The photographs and exhibits are poignant.  The museum tells the stories of the victims and their families in graphic detail.  Some of the exhibits and photos may not be the best for small children.  It is a very solemn experience.  People look at and take in the exhibits without saying a word. Only museum I have been in where everyone is silent and looks in shock.  Very powerful indeed.Once you get done with the main hall, you are greeted to a nice view of Peace Park.  This is a do not miss if you are in Hiroshima.  If you are in Kyoto or Osaka, it can be done easily as a day trip if you take the bullet train.  The museum is a 1500 yen cab ride from the train station.  Very easy.Plan to spend 90 to 120 minutes at the museum.I visited on May 23rd, 2019.  The whole museum is open (some reviews say it is closed)."
Very impressive and breathtaking,"We visited the museum and it was reasonably busy. I have never experienced such a silence with so many people. Everybody must have been with their thought when walking through the museum. Facts are displayed, stories are told. It must have been hell on earth. Please visit as early as possible, then it is not so busy. Some buildings are undergoing modification to be better protected when earthquakes occur."
Need better crowd control,"Looked like it could have been good, however there were about 6 schools attending (well over 1000 kids) and the museum staff had zero crowd control. You couldn’t even see any of the displays in the expos. Sad really. All they needed to do was to let a few people through, wait fa few minutes, and let the need lot through. This would have allowed better flow. Honestly felt like I was in rush hour traffic. Go early in the morning to dodge crowds. 1 star for crowd management only. The message is good though. World peace is important!"
Don’t miss this ,"After you’ve done the peace park you must not miss the museum. The peace park gives you a flavour of what happened here in 1945. The museum gives you a fuller, more frank and sobering experience. Be warned it is upsetting. However what’s the point in shielding yourself from the realities of what went on here. Feel it and pass it on so that it may never happen again. Many people were in tears. There are lots of personal accounts and stories of families losing children, Mothers, Fathers, Brothers & Sisters."
Huge lines to get in,I did not actually attend - and if you can pre book to skip lines I would.    They were soooo long possibly as I was visiting during Golden Week so many locals.  I was disappointed I didn't go - but plenty to keep you educated.
Worth while,"If you are contemplating weather to visit the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima, I highly recommend it! It was extremely affordable and laid out beautifully. We spent about an hour and half in there but you could easily spend even more time since there is so much to see and read. The museum is filled with real stories from real people involved in Hiroshima. Definitely worth it!"
Well put together museum,"The museum is well done, though heart breaking. Bring tissue! The museum goes over the daily life, the aftermath and info about nuclear weapons and the history."
Highlight of Hiroshima,The Peace Museum is a highlight of the town- emotional and heartbreaking. The artefacts that are scattered throughout take you back to a time that was harsh and crewel and have you leave hoping that the prayer for Peace truly does come true.
My Japan tour ,The Hiroshima peace park tragedy of world war 2  thousand  of people affected by the atomic bombIt is beautiful place to reflect on the  impacts of war
' Lest we forget' ,"If you come to Hiroshima and do not visit this museum; shame on you.Do yourself a favour and invest in the headphones, they are well worth the money. It is incomprehensible what the Japanese must have gone through on that fateful day and for generations afterwards.My children are in their twenties now and are leading their own lives.  However, if they were younger and closer to Hiroshima I would force them to come here.  Why? To understand how fragile we all are with such weapons in existence.Poignant, evocative and tearful nearly.  In other words. Brilliant!"
Moving,"This museum is one of the best I’ve been to, low entry fee yet great displays, a must do on a visit to Hiroshima. It was still under renovation when we visited but you would never have known. I loved the little section about Sadako & The Thousand Paper Cranes, a story that has stayed with me since school. The bit I found the hardest was the exhibition of the drawings the people had done at the time recounting what they saw."
Interesting,"This is a fairly large space for what there is in it, but given the number of people visiting, it needs to be. It means that you can back out of the crowds and get your breath back, which is a good thing. I found the chronology/ build up information about the Manhattan project etc. very good. You will know a lot of it already, I'm sure, but it does fill in some gaps and join up dots really well.I wasn't so bothered about the exhibits of fused glass and metal from the explosions though."
Sobering,"It was a heavy experience reading the eye witness accounts from children and family members of having to bury parents and siblings, having to deal with their own sickness and injuries, then having to find a place to live. The USA sent personnel to study the effects, but not to help the people get better"
Very well presented,A very nice museum which is presented very well.Obviously it’s a shocking thing to read and see about and they portray the victims journeys very well.Worth a visit if you’re in Hiroshima.
This is how you make a museum,"This museum has it all. Artifacts, photographs, paintings and documents on display, everything with excellent description in English. There are also film clips and interactive multimedia displays. The rental audio guide is well worth the extra 400 yen, as it gives more in depth information than the written descriptions in the displays. You could bring your own headphones or earbuds for better sound. The museum covers pretty much everything about atomic weapons including the Manhattan project and the arms race, but of course the lion’s share deals with the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and its aftermath. I dare anyone to be pro-nuclear weapons after having visited this museum. As a side note, I would recommend two fantastic books before visiting the museum. The first is ”Hiroshima Nagasaki” by Paul Ham which deals with the entire nuclear program, the run up to the actual bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It’s punctuates several myths which have flourished since the end of the war, that the bomb would save half a million lives being one of them. This is one of the best books I have read. The second book is ”Hiroshima” by John Hersey, which was published as an essay in the New Yorker in 1946, just one year after the bomb was dropped. In the book you follow a handful of people and their experience of the bomb."
Not to be missed.,When visiting Hiroshima this museum is a must. The stories told are powerful and moving. There are many personal items on view which add to the overal experience. Don’t miss it!!!
Makes you sad,"When you are in Hiroshima you also get know the sad story of this city. In this museum they show you the horror of this brutal attack. The story and the pictures make you sad and i did not spend to much time here, it’s for sure not something you wanna hear during your vacation."
Thought provoking experience!,I can’t really explain anything further than what you would expect from this museum. It is a very thought provoking experience which leaves you with a sad feeling inside but also one of hope too. It’s a must see for all visitors to the city.
Must visit but be prepare ,Very sad to see everything in here.I rent the audio which is worth it.Not much to say.Go check it out.The entry fee very cheap compare to what u get
"Compelling Exhibit Space, Main Building Currently Closed for Rennovations","Although only the smaller building is currently open, the exhibits capture the enormity of that day, and was well worth the time spent wandering through the three story exhibit space. It is also just a short walk to the overlook for the dome building."
Hibakusha,"The main museum is currently being renovated I think so the museum we saw was rather small and gives a very biased version of WWll and the reasons for the bombing. However, the video of the survivors of the nuclear bomb - the hibakusha - was really informative and frankly was the best thing about the museum."
Self guided tour with headset to guide you through the exhibits,Exhibits and information was incredible.  It was humbling to be an American there.  Make sure you take the time to sit and listen to the live accounts of the events from survivors.  Absolutely heartbreaking
A must-do. You will remember it forever,You will remember this visit forever. When you see the human and physical impacts of the nuclear bomb it makes you wonder why we persist in developing and deploying more of them. Some of our world leaders should visit here. The visit was made even more impactful by a talk by an 84 year-old survivor. It was horrific. Every overseas visitor to Japan should come here
Exceptionally Haunting,"This museum is very powerful, but for those who are sensitive it might be graphically overwhelming. It is very much like the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, but smaller."
Very sad but amazing ,This museum is well thought out but extremely emotional. Make sure you have somthing fun planned for afterwards.
Great ,A very nice museum with many very graphic images of the aftermath of the bombing. Not for the faint of heart but very necessary to see.
"Sad, peaceful and powerful message ","Let’s pray this will never happen again.  A powerful demonstration of how it can all go so wrong. The suffering that the people of Hiroshima have endured is unfathomable. I am a rather stoic individual, I could not hold back the tears during this visit."
A must see museum which everyone in the world should take notice of.,"A very well thought out and organised museum. the highlight of our visit was an hour presentation from a lady who survived the bomb. We were all moved by her story. The exhibits, and more particularly the pictures and stories about the hundreds or even thousands of children who lost their lives on that fateful Day must not be forgotten or repeated. No visit to the lovely city of Hiroshima is complete without a visit to this museum."
A sobering experience,Words cannot describe the images and accounts from people who survived the atomic bomb. The exhibition is beautifully constructed and gives a very balanced view. There is also a very good section on the state of nuclear arms today and the risk to humanity as a whole.
Understanding the past,A very thought provoking place to visit to understand the past and the decisions that were made and the consequences of those decisions for generations to come. A must do if you visit the country.
Very moving and informative,It's a very well put together museum that sets out the terrible bombing and the aftermath.  Great graphics and first hand accounts.  There are videos from survivors and items that have been saved.  Really moving and worth the visit.
"Great exhibition, sobering and scary","My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Hiroshima and Miyajima.  We had never been to either place and Hiroshima was on my bucket list. It is very moving, seeing the terrible tragedy of what can happen when countries use nuclear weapons.Museum is very well organized, lots of information from people that survived the horrors.What's also good are some videos showing what happened before, during, and after the bomb dropped.The one drawback that I did not like was that it was very one-sided.  In particular, one particular word - ""indiscriminately"" - used in describing that the US dropped the bomb on the people of Hiroshima.  Yes, the bomb was dropped, but ... nowhere did it explained the atrocities that the Japanese inflicted on others - Rape of Nanking, Pearl Harbor which drew the US into WWII!  AND the Japanese have never really apologized for their actions, unlike the Germans who have apologized and made reparations.  Not that I am being biased, just stating facts and not taking sides.Otherwise, I do believe the Museum did an excellent job of presenting the horrors of the bomb, what some objects look like (melted together) after the bomb, clothing, as well as what happened to the people.There is a clock outside, showing the number of days since a nuclear test was done, and I think it also showed number of days since an atomic bomb was dropped."
A wonderful exhibition commemorating a terrible event.,"Take your time and read everything. Listen to the video recordings of the survivors. Models of the two bombs are on view. Interestingly Nagasaki, a smaller city, was struck by a bigger bomb."
Very moving and quite scary,We queued for about an hour (during golden week) and it was busy but attended a presentation in English which was excellent and very informative.I had no idea how bad the a-bomb was and what far reaching devastation it caused - quite frightening- WE NEED TO RID THE WORLD OF THESE WEAPONSAll world leaders need to see this!
Very moving but one sided,This is a very well put together museum and is very a informative & moving account of the horrors experienced by the people of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb. Despite the overwhelming crowds it was still possible to take everything in. I did feel though that it was a bit of a one sided account in the way that it portrayed the bombing as the US doing so as a way to justify the expense of developing the bomb and not at all due to atrocities inflicted in the Pacific region.
A must see,Mrs M and I brought our two sons here (5 and 9 at the time of travel) last month. I won’t elaborate on what the museum is about. It’s a sobering experience not dissimilar to the 911 Memorial in NYC. We explained to the children what it was about and they found it informative and educational; dare I say it made them realise how lucky they are (temporarily at least!) and how heinous war can be. If you’re in Hiroshima you must visit this.
Sobering visit,"This is a must no matter how confronting some of the images and artifacts are. We had a great guide and the most beautiful spring day. Lots of people due to Golden Week, but worth the visit"
Very well done and cheap entry fee,"Refreshingly done museum showing the horror of the a bomb and aftermath. Many great exhibits and haunting photos. Large line to get in, inexcess of 1hr but worth it. 200yen admission was amazingly cheap. Fantastic. Absolutely worth it."
Don't miss it,"The main building was closed for renovations when we visited, but there was still enough in the second building to keep us occupied for several hours.  You really can't visit Hiroshima and not spend time contemplating the horrific impact of the nuclear bomb. This museum does a good job of communicating that, through photos, artifacts, and video stories of survivors.  In addition to the video playing on the wall screen, around the corner are individual booths where you can select among dozens of videos to watch, with headphones.  Very moving.  We didn't rent the audio guide, which I think is mostly a duplication of information available in English on the displays."
Far too many people to process the displays.,"Whilst the wait to get in was only 30 min at one stage the information changed from 30 to 120 min and we left the queue only for 30 to go up again. Having seen the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims which was startling in its simplicity and reverence shown by visitors, this was not possible when being herded through with not visibility of most displays and no time to even listen to the audio which we had purchased."
Extremely disappointing considering the importance of this museum.,What should have been a sobering and informative experience was completely ruined by the number of people they try and cram into the museum. I’m sure us visiting during golden week doesn’t help but we have been left completely shocked by the way they handled the large number of visitors. There is no way anyone can actually appreciate the message the museum is trying to convey if you can’t read the displays and have security shouting at the crowd every few minutes!It would be greatly improved if there was a much more rigid ticketing system in place (with time slots that you book beforehand) rather than allowing everyone who turns up into the museum. I would not recommend visiting this museum which is such a shame as it really could be so moving.
A sobering experience,The Museum is sited in the Peace Park in Hiroshima together with a range of other memorials.Unfortunately when we visited the Museum parts of it were closed for renovation. The section we visited was very crowded with crowds several people deep near some of the exhibits.We sat and watched several of the video clips from Hiroshima survivors and found them to be very moving. Hearing from actual victims and witnesses gave us a good understanding of the trauma and devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima. Seeing artefacts and photographs of the event gave us a clear understanding of the damage caused.When one is removed in time and place from an historical event one is sort of ho hum but when one visits such a site as this museum one gains an understanding of the event and and empathy for the victims. Although visiting such a site is not fun it is an educative experience that is an important of travel and should not be avoided. A visit to Hiroshima would not be complete without a visit to this museum.
A must see destination in Hiroshima.,"Yes this is a must stop destination when visiting the Hiroshima memorial sites, very enlightening and confronting, it provides a very good, clear and understandable details on the events, places and people at the time."
An extraordinary Museum,"If you vaguely remember the horrors of Hiroshima, or were too young to have it resonate, a tour of this Museum (spend at least 2 hours or more), will be emotional and life-influencing.  Deeply moving.  Very well curated and presented.  We visited twice."
Compelling experience but crowded,"You shouldn’t visit Hiroshima without seeing this museum.Recently fully reopened after undergoing seismic upgrades, this museum offers a compelling view of the horrors experienced in Hiroshima after the A-bomb in 1945.  Visitors follow a single path through the main exhibits, which are crowded with artifacts and personal stories of the survivors and family members of the deceased.  It is a horrific story, of course, and is told brutally well.  A separate part of the exhibit is devoted to attempts to control nuclear proliferation.The problem is that the museum is incredibly crowded, at least during our midday visit shortly after the museum fully reopened.  That the museum allows visitors to bring large rolling suitcases into the exhibit hall further exacerbates the crowding.  It was simply impossible to see some exhibits because of the crowding.  Quiet contemplation was not feasible.My advice would be to visit the museum as soon as it opened in the morning (or late in the afternoon) to avoid the midday crowds.  Then I’d also consider purchase of the audio guide, an expense that seemed pointless when the museum was so crowded."
not much to see here,it's a must see if you're in Hiroshima but there's little to do or see here.when i got there the main building was undergoing renovation so maybe it would have been more interesting
