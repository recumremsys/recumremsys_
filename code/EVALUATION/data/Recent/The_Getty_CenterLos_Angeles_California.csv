A decent and elegant museum,"I came here 10 years ago but visited again all is still overwhelming.It's a such beautiful museum and you can take uber to there (shuttle tram platform), and you can also call uber back to LA, it's quite convenient. Once you reach this museum, you need to take the the tram to go up the museum, it's quite interesting and exciting design to approach the museum.The museum campus is so pretty, the building, the whole design of the campus, really can give you the refreshed feeling, and feel relax. The whole area is quite big and if you would like to have reviewed and enjoyed more details, you need to reserve more time even around 4 hours.The restaurant staff is very impolite to give the feedback and ruin this great museum's image. All is good but do not recommend for the restaurant."
Must do in Los Angeles,"This is a one-of-a-kind museum, full of world-class art, beautiful gardens, and cool modern architecture. The museum is free with a reasonable parking fee, so carpool with friends. I would recommend researching what you want to see while you’re there ahead of time, as it is truly overwhelming and there is so much to do. A variety of free group tours are offered throughout the day, all of which sounded so interesting. I always love doing audio guides, and this one was no exception. This is really a gem of Los Angeles."
A must visit!,"The Getty Center is a must see - and admission to this amazing museum is free!  Parking when we were there was $19, and from the parking area, you get on a tram that takes you up to the museum.  An interesting orientation film about the museum started our visit. We didn't participate in any of the daily tours, but there were architecture and garden tours offered, as well as a number of tours about the Museum's art collections/exhibits. A schedule is provided when you arrive. The Getty Center's architecture is incredible, as are the collections of paintings, sculptures and decorative arts.  The gardens are beautiful, and the views from the Getty Center are spectacular; you can see the ocean, the city, and the mountains!"
Nice museum.,"Magnificent place in the city, the collections transport us through the great artistic movements of humanity. With spectacular views of the city of Los Angeles."
unbelievable with free admission,"The Getty Center has great views of the city and amazing artwork on display.  Although it was a rainy day, it did not spoil our visit because there is so much to see indoors.  The short tram ride from the parking area goes up the hill to the property but you can walk if you choose the challenge.  Lots of people from all over the world were visiting!  Don't miss the introductory movie in the visitor center."
Fantastic,I'm not really into art galleries and only went because my wife wanted to go.However it is fantastic.Allow most of the day and have a leisurely lunch while you are there. Take your good camera for the views.
Getty villa is better IMO,"I really wanted to like this place. It is so popular, and I live just down the road, I just HAD to visit. BUT, I’ve gotta say, the villa was far more impressive to me. Much more of a story in a quaint setting. The ghetty is a massive art gallery. Perhaps it was just all too overwhelming. Parking was a hassle. Security. Then taking a train. It’s a monster of a place. The cafe is also very expensive."
A bit of everything...,"Artisan gardens?...  Check!Art Gallery?...  Check!Fantastic views?...  Check!Open spaces and dining?...  CheckThis is a great place to spend time and enjoy the varied displays.  One thing to note is that when we arrived in late afternoon most of the cafes/restaurants stopped serving.  Otherwise, this is well worth the visit."
Fascinating Place to Visit,"The Getty Center is located on a hill adjacent to the I-405 Freeway, off a section called the Sepulveda Grade in Los Angeles.The grounds consist of museum buildings, gardens and several restaurants.  Parking is underground and a tram takes visitors up a hill to the Getty Center, itself.I'm not a big fan of art but the buildings and grounds are so pleasant to stroll (and the restaurant lunch was so out-of-this-world delicious) that I can recommend a visit to anyone.  We experienced a hazy day, but on a clear day, the views to the south, toward downtown LA, will be wonderful from any of several balconies with a southern exposure.  Fingers crossed for you!"
Get there early!,Cool trip up and down in a funicular from the car park. Had to pay for parking but it was free to enter the museum so still worth it. Lots of art if you like that kind of thing but being from the UK we are a bit spoilt with great art galleries and museums so we skipped a lot of the galleries. Great views across the city and great architecture. The cactus garden was a bit of a let down though as couldn’t get to walk around it. Get there early though as it gets super busy!
I love this place,"The artworks, and the architecture is fabulous. There are more than on restaurant here and both are good, but that will be determined by your budget"
Must see when visiting LA!,"We spent half of our last day in LA at the Getty and I would say that it probably one of the best decisions that we made. We were also fortunate enough to see Da Vinci’s sketches that were on display during that time. We also joined two free tours that were conducted by the Center. Great for picture perfect IG photos. Btw, did I already mention that entry is totally free?"
Quite nice!,"A quite interesting and nice place, good for spending a few hours there in the afternoon there. Nice place"
Beautiful Museum of Art,"This place really is super nice. Beautifully built, lots of marble, beautiful gardens, lots of great art, etc. The only downsides were that one they advertise it is ""free"" yet it cost $20 to park but even at $20 it is still a worthy visit. The place really is huge with multiple buildings and display so it does take several hours to see it all. Which of course means you will probably get something to eat which once again means be prepared as it won't be cheap.The artwork and most of the exhibits were excellent, we were there while the Michael Angelo exhibit was going and it was mostly his small sketches that he did preparing to do a painting or sculpture, what I found most interesting is learning how he approached his work and his history.There was also a photography exhibit that was a joke. How someone tagged many of these photos as being worthy of an art museum is beyond me. There was a picture of a giraffe that has been taken by school kids every day about 1000 times. There were multiple pictures, from expired canisters of film, that were literally nothing more than a white spot or black spot. There was a picture of a woman sitting in front of a TV, one of a plastic dog in a Chinese restaurant and one that was a photographer's self-portrait that was out of focus and red! They were ridiculous and a waste of time. I have seen better photography on Facebook!But overall, excellent place and worthy of a visit."
A winner,"Lucky for us we arrived after 3, just, so parking was $15 otherwise it's $20 and the entry is free which is wonderful for such a facility.You have to then get a tram to the top of the hill and entrance.The building itself is a work of art and the landscaping too.The gardens are in my '1001 to see before I die' book. Well, they are very good, modern and some colour even in February. The azaleas in the 'pond' were a very good effect. Being able to walk through some of the other planting in raised beds was also lovely with bulbs out now and promise of things to come. Love the bougainvilea umbrellas, just starting to bloom. Good cacti on green roof, not seen that done before. Lots of sculpture and other water features outside too.Of course there is art. Good, 'proper' art old school masters and a collection of French furniture set out in a room scheme.We only spent 2 hours here but could easily spend longer if the weather was good enough to sit outside with a drink and you lingered longer over the art.Great view over Beverley Hills and Bel Air too and the whole of LA really."
beautiful architecture and museum,"there seems to be a bit of something for everyone from paintings of all eras, sculptures to antique artefacts.  the museum itself is beautiful with a nice garden and a view from the mountain top.  best of all, the entry fee is free.  the cost of parking will be $15-$20 depending on where you park, but the museum is super easy to get to from any parking lots nearby."
This place is FANTASTIC,"This place is FANTASTIC. The permanent collections are rich and varied. We were lucky to come across the temporary exhibition dedicated to Manet, which brought together an impressive quantity of magnificent works. The architecture of the place highlights the gardens. A long visit is essential."
rich in history,There is so much to see.  Make an entire day trip or visit multiple times.  The time spent meandering the grounds is well worth it too.  Every time i go back i feel like there is something new to see.
Very captivating and humbling.,I wasn't really keen on going here but did because it was raining. I am so glad it was raining! An excellent informative and educational place for all ages and races.It would take two days to really explore this monumental place.
Best view of Los Angeles,"Beautiful diverse collection, in a spectacular environment. Enjoy the art and the architecture. Find a spot to sit in the sun and watch the city."
"Amazing view and great exhibits, beautiful gardens","You ride a shuttle to the top of the hill where the building is situated.  When you stand on the balcony, you have a 360 degrees of fabulous view of Los Angeles areas, such as downtown. Sta. Monica,  and you can see the Pacific ocean .The exhibit rooms are filled with great exhibits. The gardens  are beautiful. You can just sit and relax and be around to see the beauty of nature ."
Wonderful gardens,The impressionists gallery is great. I think the biggest draw is the outdoor space. Beautiful setting and views!
The views! The art! The views!,"What a fantastic place. We were not expecting the breathtaking views from the Getty. That alone was worth the visit. The outdoor spaces were wonderful. The art was wonderful (I loved the inlaid cabinets, the goldfish chandelier, the impressionist paintings.) The garden was in bloom. All free!Long Uber drive. Best destination of our trip."
Wonders to amaze us,"The Getty, if you have not been a place of dreams. World renowned artist , displaying there talents. Talent is a gift , creation of dreams, A Must see in L a., You pay for parking , entrance is free. Food is available. Check schedule ,sometime in the summer evenings they have music preformances. Best go to  The Getty.com, where a hat, sunscreen sunglasses. Fun for all , Kids love it, plenty of walking, lots of seating areas.Its what I call mindless entertainment, just dream about what your seeing your , be carefree, relax enjoy the time there.It will be with you the remender of your life. Total distraction from our lifes , It so great the Getty s share the with the publicHard not to feel humble, inspired. I try to go every couple months. Read up on the artist prior to going. Ask at desk for free tours, headphones available. GO"
"Fabulous View, Great Exhibits and Beautiful Gardens",I have to say my favorite place to be at the Getty Center are the Gardens in the back. A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the middle of LA. The curated art collection is fabulous and exhibits change regularly. On a beautiful day the views across the city toward the Pacific Ocean is breathtaking. Entry is free! You will pay for parking but it’s reasonable and either in the bottom of the hill on the grounds of the center or just across the street. A tram will bring you up to the center itself. Highly recommended
Great place to visit,"Very nice atmosphere, well designed and organized, the Garden is a must see, I just wish they had a bigger and better food place up there."
Relax and enjoy the view,"Go up in a tram, appreciate the art, the architecture, then walk into the garden, relax and enjoy the panoramic view of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean."
Great way to spend an Afternoon,The Kids and I had fun and there was something new to learn for everyone. Took a picnic lunch with us so we sat under the shade and ate.
Better Than Expected,"Crowded but easy parking, efficient tram ride to spacious mountain top.  Large galleries, well-organized, and interesting special exhibits, . . .  art, furniture and photography  . . . . plus outdoor spaces are magnificent with great views.  Depending on your speed, it could be an all day activity, but an afternoon will"
Great Deal,I  live in Los Angeles. Have many relatives from out of State. I take them to Getty Center when they visit. It is a great place and it is free. A high quality place to go . The Art and paintings are fantastic. My relatives are really happy I took them there. One of the best attractions in Los Angeles
Beautiful center,"Beautiful and majestic centre; lots of beautiful famous art works, staffed by very friendly volunteer staff"
Artwork + Views,"This is a must stop visit if you're in LA and want to check out amazing artwork, scenery and views of LA."
Wonderful,"Even if you are not a huge fan of the artwork, the setting is amazing. The buildings themselves are stunning, the views are unreal and there is a great restaurant as well. Admission is free adn the ride up to the top is pretty cool. parking is $20.00. Great and cheap way to spend a few hours in LA.PS. The art is amazing."
Ok ,The museum was interesting. Then we had a awful lunch at the restaurant. 95 usd for 2 people.and that for a salad.Go to a another restaurant. Way overpriced.
Full day needed,"I loved the Getty Center - much more beautiful than expected. The exhibitions, the garden, the view...definitely need a full day here to really enjoy it. Tip: if you're getting an Uber/Lyft there, request to be dropped outside during peak times - the traffic to get to the tram entrance takes longer than walking!"
"Wow! An amazing synthesis of art, architecture, and landscaping; Not to be missed!","We came to a conference  in LA, had a day to look around, never saw the Getty before so we went by Uber. What an amazing place!  No entrance charges and a recorded audio tour was gratis (but we needed to leave a driver's license as security- but not a problem).  The weather was perfect, the grounds are out of this world wonderful! The buildings , nestled into the hills are spectacular, pleasing to the eye and aesthetics, and integrated well indeed.  Upon arrival in the drop off center we saw the first of the sculpture gardens.  We then took the tram to the main building complex. The steps had a Maillol sculpture (outstanding), and heralded the further enjoyment. The various buildings housed various collections and everything produced and indoor-outdoor synthesis.  We loved the European paintings especially the impressionists. The other Paintings were likewise enjoyable. We also enjoyed the pastels collections and Michelangelo  drawings (in a different building.  The gardens were spectacular and designed with extraordinary care. Many visitors were  stretched out on the lawns enjoying the sun, the sights and picnics. The staff (many volunteers) were very friendly and helpful. A second sculpture garden also showed two Maillol pieces as well as from Moore.  from the garden we found a spectacular view  of LA from the the high hills vantage.  We came early on Saturday, and spent over 5 hours, by which time the number of visitors increased.  We could easily have spent the whole day, and we definitely plan to return again."
Spectacular.,"The Getty is one of those places that, when you're there, you can't quite believe that something like this exists. The view is such that you can see the exact spot where the smog meets the sea. My friend and I did not have much time here, but were able to ogle at the architecture and take a quick walk through the gardens. Everything was magnificent, aside from the price of parking ($20!) We visited on a Monday morning and there were many elementary school groups visiting as well. It was fun to share the space and the wonder with the kiddos."
Wonderful architecture and garden. Great docent tours.,"We did a Highlights tour which focused on 4 works of art. Excellent docent, invited reflection, discussion and art appreciation. The garden and architecture tours are very interesting. All free tours and many to choose from during the day. Generally, the collection does not have major works of art in the collection. Still worth a visit. Wonderful view of LA."
Elevates one's mind!,"The architecture, the views, the exhibits, just makes one smile. There is something special for everyone's taste. Just to go there and relax in that environment leaves the hustle and bustle of everyday life behind."
Beautiful,"The Getty is beautiful. The scenery and the location is breathtaking. The tram ride up is exciting as it is! We had lunch in the restaurant at the top, very fancy, high priced, but extremely worth the price. The art was unique and beautiful"
ART,"A artist's heaven. Getty is free admission. Food available at event prices. Sit down you should make reservations or eat with the masses in the lower food court. Parking used to be $5.00, but has gone up. To see and assimilate every thing plan on a day."
An absolute must see in LA,"I can see why this is the #1 attraction in LA - this place is spectacular.  The architecture of the campus, the gardens and how it all ties in to the land on which it sits is simply amazing.  Adding a world class art collection and you have an unbeatable combination.  Sadly our architecture tour was not the best but one in our party was very familiar with the design process and was able to fill in the gaps.  Make sure to look for all the views framed by the structure.  Pay attention to reflections in the glass as they can be fascinating.  Take a few minutes to watch the hummingbirds.  Enjoy the gardens, the views of the city and the ocean. It is overwhelming.  I will definitely revisit this place again to soak it all in!"
Recommend the Architecture tour,"The art galleries were gorgeous, but we especially liked the Architecture tour through the grounds of the Getty Center, followed by our own tour of the architecture-inspired garden. The city and mountain views are amazing. And it's all free!"
Amazing views + gardens are superb.,"I visited for the architecture, the gardens + the LA view (versus the art collection).  I wasn't disappointed. Love the tram/light rail that takes you from carpark to museum + the overall layout of the property is beautifully designed."
Beautiful facility,We are not surprised that this is on every top 10 list of things to see in Los Angeles.  The facility and gardens are beautiful.  Well worth the visit.
Great Art Museum + beautiful grounds,"Not enough good things to say about this well curated art museum. The grounds have an exquisite garden, with views of the ocean. Different buildings concentrate on different time periods and different types of art. So sculpture, tapestry, painting, etc all there somewhere. Lots of walking required."
Worth the visit during your LA stay,"Make sure to put aside a whole day when you come here.  Start early and go floor by floor, building by building...and see the gardens, etc.  Make sure to have a leisurely lunch at their excellent restaurant.  Get a tour to make your experience even better!"
The Getty Center and Getty Gardens,Visited the Getty Center over the weekend and spend the morning strolling through all the 5 Getty museums and Getty Gardens. This is MUST VISIT place as it is very relaxing and enjoyable to spend 4-5 hours here.
Beautiful museum + stunning museums + decent art collection,"The Getty is such a beautiful day to spend a day at -- rain or shine. I would recommend coming here for the architecture and the views. Personally, the art collection here isn't the best (primarily European paintings) but there are some paintings and art pieces worth looking at. The garden terrace area is a great place to have a picnic or enjoy a sunny day. Very kid-friendly. There are many tables and benches throughout so you can enjoy the great LA weather. I think the views are much nicer when it's bright and sunny, however, I enjoyed my experience way more when it was a rainy day (it was empty and views of a foggy LA are so lovely). The architecture is breathtaking and the views from the various viewpoints at the center are incredible! Outdoors has a stunning garden and multiple fountains and water sites. Sculptures are scattered all around the grounds.Entrance into the museum is FREE. Parking is $20, but reduced to $15 if you go after 3PM. On Saturdays, it's $10 after 6PM. Parking is in a garage and there's a tram that takes you up to the center."
Los Angeles,Very nice trip and was really impressed. Visited  Hollywood and surrounding areas .went to shopping malls on 7th street tasted nice continental foods all was a great fun and a good experience. Took some ayurvedic medicine with me after consultation with an ayurvedic practitioner Naomi who was really nice and humble personally and helped me alot.
The View was INCREDIBLE!!! Not to be missed if you are anywhere in the Southern California area.  CLOSED on Mondays.,"We had the BEST day ever.  The Getty Center is free and you only pay for parking.  The Getty is beautiful!  Everything about the Getty from the architecture to the art to the gardens is first class.  Even the food was wonderful in the restaurant.  GREAT menu, wonderful food, lovely wine and a wonderful view and that was just our lunch.  ENJOY!!"
Great place to spend the day,"There is no entry fee , you have to only pay for parking .the grounds and buildings are amazing and the collection of art will keep you busy for hours. The grounds are good to wonder through. The cafe and restaurants are a bit pricey , the cafe food is ok .I would recommend taking your own food and drinks , they have place to sit and eat. Not much for young kids but they are very welcome in the buildings and grounds. If your in LA then check it out"
Great art/architecture/view,"Everything about this place is special. The archtecture, the view over LA and the art collection itself are all beautiful."
Such variety,"Stopped by here on my way out of town having never been before. Very impressed by the variety in the collection. For someone who does not want to be overwhelmed by one style or medium in a specialized gallery, this is definitely far from that. And its free! (except for parking)."
"Beautiful grounds, but crowded and not my favorite art collection","I'd never been to the Getty Center before I visited it this past weekend when visiting LA with my husband and my brother. While I enjoyed the visit, I don't recommend going on a weekend if you can help it. Here's the situation: the museum is free to visit, but you pay $20 to park (same as Getty Villa). This is fine, except even parking is a chore. It took us about 20 minutes to be able to pull into the parking garage in the afternoon on a Saturday. Then there's a tram that will take you up the hill to the Getty Center. The line for this was insane, so we decided to walk up ourselves. If you're able, I suggest this on busy days: it's a bit steep but pretty and not very long (maybe 10-15 minutes). Once we got up there, we realized that many people come more for the grounds than the museum! Many families had brought picnics with them and set up on the grass with the view of LA in front of them. Smart idea. The grounds and the buildings are beautiful. I wasn't terribly impressed by the collection though. If the museum has any art from 1875 on (except for that in a small temporary exhibition), I must have missed it. The collection wasn't terribly varied and just wasn't my cup of tea, really. The highlights of the museum for me were the temporary exhibitions: ""Unseen: 35 Years of Collecting Photographs"" and ""Kathe Kollwitz: Prints, Process, and Politics""! But I didn't love the museum's permanent collection. It's very crowded and busy on weekends, which doesn't make it the most pleasant place to visit. I'd say the grounds and building are lovely though. If you're visiting LA and only have time for the Getty Villa or the Getty Center, I'm Team Getty Villa all the way."
World Class Amazing Phenomenal Free Art Museum,Well worth the trip to this amazing art museum with excellent views. If you don't want to drive the LA city bus service will take you from downtown or UCLA area to a stop directly opposite the entrance to the museum at a bargain price.
Exploring museum in LA,"Excellent art museum with a large collection. I have enjoyed the visit.  You can see pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, decorative arts, American and international photographs. There is also the contemporary and modern sculpture;There is also  tthe Robert Irwin's Central Garden."
Must see in LA!,"Gorgeous architecture. Beautiful iconic classic art. Van Gogh’s Irises! Great for 3-4 hours. Great views from terraces. Food in cafeteria really good, but a bit pricey."
Impressive site and beautiful gardens,"We did take a guided tour.  Tours are every hour:  architecture and separate garden tour.  The guide for the architecture tour was knowledgeable about the architect Meier and the Getty history.  Meier obsession with angles / 22.5, white surfaces, alignment/geometry are all on display.  Highly recommend that tour.  Thankfully the garden architect was Robert Irwin focused on colors and shapes to complement the austerity of Meier style.  The Garden tour was a bit light on content although it was our second time there and always a highlight to visit the garden; the hard scrapping and the flowers/plant/trees are an integrated sensory experience with nature and human creativity.  It is a free museum albeit the parking $20 if you drive,. We had lunch in the cafe - varied choices from pho to pizza, etc.  well done.  There is also a higher end restaurant. The art collection on display is on the smaller side but with some of the best.  Photo collection on the lower level."
All of the Getty is worth the visit.,"From the scenic views, to the beautiful architecture, to the amazing gardens and the exquisite art and the gourmet food, the Getty Center is well worth the half or more of a day you can easily spend there.  You'll want to go back!"
Absolutely amazing,The Getty Centre is a TrueType amazing place to visit. It is a very modern building up on a hill. There is a funicular train to get to the top and the views are spectacular. The buildings are set in some beautiful gardens and the works of art are world class. Admission is free.
Impressive,A very impressive collection of art. A lovely way to spend the day and experience LA.  Had a lot of fun and the gardens are lovely.  The line for parking was a bit long but moved fairly quickly so wasn’t too bad.  Absolutely would return especially in the warmer months.
Architecture and Arts,"My family brought us and spent a day here.  We had a relaxing and good time viewing all the wonderful and amazing pieces of paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, architectures and all kinds of arts in this vast museum."
"Must Visit, if you are in LA!","Stunning architecture and collection ... one of a kind! Could easily spend half day here. Getty Villa, the sister property, is also worth a visit. World class collection ... a well kept secret!"
A true jewel of art and culture,"No matter how many times you go there, or how many world-famous museums you see, Getty is truly a next level od combining art, design, world culture, and civilization. And a bit more, those amazing gardens and breathtaking views. It is a definitive must, no matter if you are local or a tourist. It is the place that uplifts personal knowledge, art excitement and entertainment."
"Getty, Getty .. a million times Getty !","No matter how many times I come to LA I have to come to the Getty. Such a beautiful place, very well welcomed at all times, so much to see, and enjoy the Los Angeles and neighbourhood views. Don’t think it twice if you in LA."
Always somiething new to explore,"No matter if you have only a short time or a few hours, The Getty has so much to enjoy and explore. Their shop has really good stuff too. They even have things on sale. A great place to see again and again. Great parking underground and nivce tram ride with awesome views on the way up and down. AMazing place to take photos of the City Skyline - day or night"
HEAVEN,Exquisite in every way. For us going to the Getty is like stepping through into the gates of heaven. Pure sensual bliss. Everything about this sanctuary is uplifting. Our cousin Julian was the curator so sometimes we even got the pleasure and privilege of back stage tours  and it is as amazing behind the curtains as well.  This is a must if you go to L A
Great Museum,Visiting the Getty Center is one of the best experience for anyone visiting Los Angeles. A full day of fun and amazing thing to see with a great view
Great works of art surrounded by natural beauty,Some of the world's great artworks on display with distinctive and well curated exhibits. Great place for a stay-cation if you are a LA local or memorable and educational stop for visitors from out of town.
Beautiful and educational,Breath taking views and an amazing place to relax watching the city down below. Amazing museums with so many interesting items.
"Beautiful location, interesting exhibits","Beautiful buildings and spectacular location with amazing views on a clear day. Lots of underground parking and convenient. Free monorail ride up the hill. Can be crowded but never overwhelming,  but I  would avoid weekends. Art collection is fine but not great and it is interestingly grouped by period. Landscaping is beautiful.  Expensive food, like most art museums."
"Money, not an object.","From the moment we stepped out of the car in the parking lot, it was apparent that this place oozes class.  Don't get off from an abundance of art masterpieces, sculpture, decorative arts, and photographs?  Then just go for the view from the jaw-dropping views of Los Angeles from this architectural masterpiece.  It should be illegal if you don't take our-of-town visitors here."
one of a kind,"The location and view are extraordinary, as are the collections. Parking is very expensive, but entry is free. If you're in a hurry, don't go. Make it at least a half day thing."
Crh3787,"The experience was fantastic.  The art inside the buildings was exceptional but then, the architecture and scenery outside was phenomenal.  The tram experience up the mountain to the museum was very popular with the young children.  I can’t recommend this experience enough."
Amazing,"This place is an amazing place.  The information provided by the docents, the grounds, the history, and of course the art.  Everyone should see this.  Everything isn't for everyone but there seems to be something for everyone."
Sao Paolo to LA ,"Great views, exciting exhibits, amazing garden. A truly unique museum experience. This is an absolute when you're in LA."
"Go for the art, stay for the views and the gardens","This is a world class collection almost upstaged by the architecture, views of Los Angeles and carefully curated gardens.  Give it enough time to enjoy it all.  Special exhibits are well done as well.  As locals we go often."
A must see,"Ideal for young and old.  Outstanding art, amazing reviews, beautiful gardens, even a pretty good cafe -- not outrageously priced; and admission is free!  Even my grandchildren (ages 7 and 4) loved it."
Must see in LA,"If you have visited Louvre, Prado or Hermitage museums Getty Center art collection wouldn't impress you but its still worth visiting because of the outdoor parts and gardens."
Lunch and the out of doors,I like to make this an outdoor event. Make a reservation for lunch at the restaurant and ask for window seating. Best time is after a rain as the normal smog is gone. Views are fantastic. The menu is diverse enough for everyone’s taste. Take the architectural tour. Walk the garden. Have fun.
Treasure trove,"This is a free event thanks to the generosity of the Getty family, he was a collector with an oil company budget, location is gr8 views all over L.A., no expenses were spared garden gr8"
Not to be missed when in the area,"We were in the Getty for a few hours over 2 days, and need to come bak to see more of it. The outdoor parts, gardens  and architecture alone are worth the trip. Entry is free and the gift shops are very tempting. The galleries hold amazing treasures. However, if you have any vision issues, bring theater glasses as you cannot get too close to the art. The line you cannot cross is marked in a few places, but not in others. If you have trouble seeing, you'll have trouble telling where the line is as well. Guards are unflinching on that subject. It would have been nice to be able to get closer to the tag if not the art, so I could read what I was looking at. I left a comment to that effect. There are audio devices that are free of charge, but you have to wait in line for one and leave your ID at the counter. You also have to be able to read the number on the painting tag in order to listen to the description. Not all works have numbers, and the temporary exhiobits don't. That was my only issue. Everything else was great."
One of the best,"Amazing collection and some of the worlds most important art. All of the masters are represented and the buildings are well laid out and beautifully designed. A must see gallery, up there with the best anywhere. Free to enter but parking will cost you $20."
Awesome,A great collection in a great setting. The buildings are well laid out on a hill top with surrounding gardens.
A Fantastic Place to Visit,"We spent all day visiting the Getty. Viewing the art work was a phenomenal experience. We also enjoyed walking around the exterior of the building and taking in the amazing architecture and gardens. We took several free walking tours regarding specific periods of art and a walking tour regarding the architecture and gardens, all very interesting, Most of the tours are only about an hour long, enough to keep you interested the whole time."
Stunning Architecture And Location,"For me the property was more impressive than the art collections it houses. While their are lots of interesting pieces it really doesn't hold a candle to the Met or MOMA, in NYC. Still, the travertine marble buildings, the single gauge train that brings you from the parking garage and the hilltop setting make it a unique and spectacular museum. A must see when in L.A."
"Excellent venue for Artists, History, Architecture and views of LA!","This time we went in the early evening for a lecture. Go online to see exhibitions, they are mostly very impressive. Parking is excellent, especially during the week. I recommend going for lunch at the cafe and spend a few hours there until Sunset."
Getty Center,We had an all too brief visit of the wonderful art. The architecture is outstanding. We went after 3pm and the parking is reduced to $15.  It is $25 before. The museum is free with an audio iPod tour. If you go late you will see an incredible sunset. The views are out standing.

"Architecture, gardens and great art","It is convenient to be dropped off by a ride share company and take the tram up the hill to the Getty Center.  Evidence of fire was all around beginning at the tram center and the on top looking over to other ridge lines at the level of the Getty Center.  One is struck immediately by the beauty of the built environment on the Getty Center campus and the landscaping.  The architecture is striking and affords a wide range of views and perspectives.  Follow your eyes and take the paths.  Go up and go down and all around.  The architects have created a welcoming and endlessly interesting set of spaces.  Much of the building surfaces is covered in travertine from Italy.  Squares and circles are repeating patterns that integrate the buildings.We have visited the Getty Villa and viewed its fine collections.  The Getty Center is its extension and expansion, moving forward in time from where the Getty villa collections leave off.  The collections are vast and need to be swallowed in bites.  The Getty offers many tours and we chose one as an introduction..  Most of the topical tours last about an hour.  We chose one on the “Impressionists” and were delighted.  We saw four paintings by Monet we had not seen before, including one extraordinary still life that was also painted by Renoir from a slightly different perspective.  We also saw the exceptional Van Goah “Irises.” That painting was a highlight, featuring a single white iris on the left side of the painting and a white and blue iris on the far right.The weather was glorious and the vistas and views from the terraces were superb.  The cactus garden on the south promontory was spectacular.  We aim to visit again and soon when the gardens are in full bloom, including the flowering maze."
WOW !!!,Got here early for 10 am garden tour and spent 4+ hours walking over all the grounds and exhibits - this place is jaw dropping in beauty This is a must see in LA and its free to boot - jusdt pay to park and get on the tram to the top for an experenice you wont forget
Using Public Transportation from LAX to Getty Center,"I did it in late Jan 2020.  It's not hard to go to Getty Ctr from LAX directly, provided you are flexible with time and are comfortable in using public transportation. (1) From LAX, take the LAX Shuttle (free) Look for the hot pink signs posted all over outside, you want to take the Employee lot (South) bus.(2) The shuttle bus takes you to a bus Center Depot to change onto a  Culver City Bus #6(North bound).  Very important to take the NORTH Bound bus #6(3) #6 will take about 55 minutes to Westwood UCLA area for transfer to Bus 734(4) Super easy, but you will pay separately for 734, no transfer given.  The fare is less than $2. And Westwood by UCLA is a great place to get something to eat. (5) 734 goes through some very expensive neighborhood uphill (about 20 minutes or so) to the door of Getty Center.  (6) From the bus stop, you just walk  2 minutes to get onto a free Getty Tram uphill to the Getty Ctr( free).  It has clean restroom facility right at the Tram station. Do the same in reverse direction to return to LAX. The South LAX shuttle bus is on bay# 12 at the Bus Depot for returning to LAX.  If you take SouthWest, it is located at Terminate #1.  With some in advance planning, going to Getty Center from LAX is very doable; driving on 405 out of LAX  is not for the faint of heart!  Westwood area has a lot of buses going to /coming from all places nearby.  The bus displays signs and announces stops - who knows LA bus can be so rider friendly.  Note - they do the bag search at the Getty Ctr. Tram station before you get onto the tram.  It is a 15 mins uphill walk, if you wish. - When it is windy, Getty Ctr closes its indoor restaurant and the choices from the garden cafe Kiosi is very limited. Getty Ctr  collection in my opinion has more in breadth than in depth; you may want to take advantage of the free tour (usually 1 hr) given on specific area of focus. and be prepared for the long line to get a free audio ear piece.  This super rich museum should be on your LA visit list- it is totally free, great bird's eye view of the west side of LA, relative new and very clean with helpful staff on site."
Getty shining brither then diamond,"I loved Getty center. It is a pleasure having this type of object in Los Angeles. Architecture is impressive, stunning and their gradens are so much pretty so I cant describe them. If you love architecture visit Getty!"
Art Lovers Dream,"For a long time I have wanted to visit the Getty Center. My husband made my dream come true just last week. Having the opportunity to visit this architectural wonder in such a gorgeous setting made my whole year! The photographic exhibit, the gardens, and the incredible European paintings make it hard to decide where to go next. I have to admit that van Gogh’s Irises was my favorite, but in the same gallery are Monet, Manet, Pissarro.  It was hard to move away.Getting to the Getty means navigating Los Angeles traffic. It’s just a fact of life. But once you get off the 405 and enter the parking garage, you are in a different world. The tram ride to the top is scenic, quick and easy. Once there, you’re deposited in a beautiful courtyard with views of architecturally amazing buildings.  Grab a map to wander on your own, do an audio tour or take one of the frequently offered specific guided tours.  Nothing will disappoint.If you want a special meal, check out the Restaurant at the Getty Center — best to make lunch or dinner reservations ahead.  Otherwise, there is a great cafe with an extraordinary number and variety of options in a great setting.Enjoy the fountains, the views of the surrounding hills and the pacific as well as the outdoor relaxing spaces.  You will have a truly memorable experience."
A magical place,"We had such an amazing experience at this museum. Our school group had a tour and then was able to spend the afternoon learning about, and enjoying, world-class art. I'm so grateful for their field trips and educational programs."
Absolutely Fabulous!!! Best Attraction in LA!!,"WOW!! From its stunning architecture to the impressive views of LA, from its beautiful gardens to the fresh/tasty food in its cafeteria, the Getty Center has it all...and we haven’t even touched on the art inside yet. Varied, extensive, and loaded with masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture, furniture and photography this museum is a highlight of any visit to LA. It’s easy to see why the Getty is the TripAdvisor #1 of ~2500 things to do in LA. I spent over 3 hours at the Getty and still could have used more time. If the Getty Center was a restaurant it be a Michelin 3* - “exceptional museum that is worth a special journey.”"
Nice way to enjoy art of 15th. Century and later. ,"Beautiful location with stunning views of the City. Nice Art but not spectacular. Somewhat confusing mishmash of galleries, buildings and open spaces. The travel from the parking lot to the museum was slow and cumbersome. Otherwise a nice experience."
Wedding weekend,"What a beautiful place this is , had such an awesome time with friends , parking is a bit funky but had an awesome time regardless"
Awesome views!,The architecture of the buildings were beautiful and the views of the city were breathtaking. The tram was a quick and easy ride up. I would recommend spending a couple of hours and go on a nice day!
Museum in LA,While visiting family on our last vacation day we went to the Getty Center. This was an amazing place in a beautiful location. It was a holiday weekend so it was very busy but once we entered the complex there were so many places to see it seemed that the people went in different directions. I would love to go again and spent the day there. We had time to see only three exhibits but they were most impressive.
Checked one off my bucket list,"Enjoyed great view, impressionists’ works , wonderful lunch . Missed a tour because I didn’t realize it was limited to a certain number of people. I stayed about 3 1/2 hours and wanted 2 more hours."
Must See,"We’ve always wanted to visit the Getty Center but didn’t make it. This time we made a day of it and definitely lots of great pieces that you must see. What’s great about the Getty is you can start in one building and connect to the next building. When your done, you can grab a quick snack and sit outside in the garden to just enjoy the view"
Beautiful location to explore above LA,"The Getty Center is such a beautiful location and worth a visit out of the hustle of LA.  The grounds are lovely and peaceful with great vistas. Had a teenager with us who wasn’t thrilled about visiting a museum but bared with us as we explored (not like we hadn’t seen all the LA teen hotspots before haha). Very well done and enjoyable, glad we did it."
Surrounded by Beauty,"The Getty is a beautiful museum. Not only is the art beautiful, the architecture, garden, view, & restaurant are breathtaking as well."
Worth it!!,"Awesome museum in a really neat building. The architecture and collection of art were definitely worth the visit! I would really recommend joining one of the free 1 hour guided tours. The collection of art is on the smaller side, compared to the MET or the Chicago Art Museum, but the setting, architecture and educational tour made up for that!!!!!"
Such an experience ,Easy access with facilities.Restaurants and rest rooms are available.Extensive and interesting collections.Beautiful view and it has a good landscapes.A “must to see” place.Highly recommended.
Incredible views ,"This is another place where you ca spend several days. There are a variety of tours available, but we just opted to walk around on our own. The collections are impressive, but my favorite part was the gardens and various outdoor areas affording incredible views of the city and beyond. The architecture of the museum itself is a wonder."
Awesome!,"The Getty is so awesome because they have such a variety of beautiful pieces- furniture, sculpture, paintings and more! I especially loved the top level, many rooms full of beautiful paintings by famous artists, including Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and more. And the paintings are not roped off. You can walk right up to them and see the texture and brush strokes. If you are visiting Los Angeles, don't miss the getty!"
Well Worth a Visit,A great place to wonder around in for several hours.  Watching the sunset from there was an added bonus!
Amasing Combinations of Ancient and Modern Architectrutral Designs,"The designer used two different shapes to represent the ancient and modern feeling of the whole complex of the center. Rectangular shape is for the modern while the circle is for the ancient. Everywhere in the center, you can get this idea!. The most impressed me is the garden with a lot of cactus located at the south end of the center. You can enjoy the whole view of the city of LA from there!"
Interesting stop,"A must stop for lovers of art and history. Kind of quirky, but what else would you expect to be built by a billionaire who thought himself the reincarnation of a Roman emperor."
Fantastic museum.  The Best of LA. ,"This is one of the best Attractions that Los Angeles has to offer.  Situated on a hilltop overlooking the ocean with spectacular views, the gardens and building of the Getty center are worth a visit on their own.  Within the galleries is an amazing variety of art work.  We particularly enjoyed the current large special exhibition of photographs from the Getty collection.  Plan to spend at least half a day.    Admission is free but parking down below is $20. Ride the tram to the hilltop."
볼 거리도 놀기 편한 곳 (저녁 코스 추천) weekend night course,"사촌언니네 조카들과 함께 방문했었는데, 주말 저녁 시간이지만 붐비지 않고, 넉넉하게 전시 감상하고 아이들도 뛰어놀 수 있는 곳이라 좋았음I visited in late afternoon but not so crowded and enough space to see and play for children too."
Do Not Miss this Place,"Absolutely a place you I should not miss if you visit LA.  Not only is there no admission charge, but the free tours are numerous and focus on various interests - architecture, gardening, art, sculpture.  The views are simply spectacular - from mountains, to hillsides, to downtown LA and, if you are lucky and the day is clear, the Pacific Ocean!! Every part of this place is an adventure.  The tram ride up from the parking area alone is worth the trip.  Plan to spend at least 3 hours here; more if you include the art museum.  Wish we had planned to stay longer.  Can’t wait to return with my grandchildren!"
AMAZING,Every kind of art imaginable.  It is located on the top of a hill and you can look out over the nearby neighborhoods.  The grounds and art works are unbelievable.  You could easily spend a day here admiring all the different types of exhibits and art.  A wonderful experience.
An Artful Must,"Located on top of a hill in the Bel Aire slopes, the Getty Center is one of the most beautiful attractions in Los Angeles.  The grounds, structures and most importantly the art within are unparalleled to other art institutions.  Plan on at least a half day there."
Fantastic Free Art Museum,Changes with all the exhibits but always has great art and unbelievable views of the west side of Los Angeles and Pacific Ocean
"Superlative, breathtaking views","This place is a marvel. I have visited many museums, but this one really impressed me. I won't speak too much about the collection. You have the museum's webpage for that, but this one rivals the MET's or the any other European museum. Go!!!"
ALWAYS Amazing and Incredibly Breathtaking!!!,Just LOVEEEE this place!! I realllly wish I could get there more often however were ever I do or suggest someone to visit it the response is ALWAYS overwhelmingly GOOOOD!!! I love it in the summers when they do live music and wine in the courtyard!! You can buy a bottle at one of their kiosks (unfortunately not bring your own;) and walk the grounds with it!! It’s just AWESOME and a MUST when in LA!!
Lots of Artwork on display ,"I am more of a science nerd then history or art. There is a tram that takes you from the parking lot to the Getty Centre. The parking is cheaper after 3pm at $15 USD. You only need a few hours so I would suggest arriving for around 3pm. The entire property is amazing to look at and the views from the Getty Centre are amazing. It is free to check out all the displays in each building, but unless you're a history or art buff then this may not be for you. The food spots all close by 3pm so if you plan on eating up there be there before 3pm. There is a small coffee stand with snacks that stays open, but it's very expensive! Also bring a sweater or jacket as it gets cold up there during none summer months!"
Great place to spend the day in LA,"The Getty Center is a free center with tons of wonderful art from medieval times through impressionism. I took the self-guided audio tour of the Manet exhibit (only open through January 12, 2020) and the guided tour of the museum highlights - I highly recommend both. There is a nice cafe with a gorgeous view of LA county for lunch - food court style but with lots of options. Just the views themselves are amazing. The garden is beautiful, even in January."
"Of all the places I’ve ever reviewed, this is my favorite and a not to be missed if you are in LA","Every time I’ve been in LA, circumstances have prevented me from coming to the Getty. But as I was about to leave LA for an around the world trip to London, I was damned and determined not to miss it this time. So I flew in early just to spend the day there—and I swear that everything I will see in the next four months will be hard pressed to equal it. I opted to walk the .75 miles from the Uber drop off to the museum—and I was glad I did. The walk alone gave me a sense of the wonders to come as I left the 405 behind. And I still can’t believe there was no entrance charge. I make it a point to visit art museums wherever I travel in the US and to see what I saw for no charge was beyond awesome. Of course there was the Van Gogh’s Irises and all of the “must sees” but what struck me was the curated brilliance of the Getty. It didn’t try to be everything to everybody. And, as a result, it was simply magnificent. And the brilliant architecture of it all allowed you to feel uncrowned. I spent the entire day there and I doubt on this trip that anything short of Petra will rival the Getty. There is incredible power that incredible money can wield. And the Getty has wielded it with grace. I will forever remember my visit there as one of the most memorable times of my life."
The Varied Exhibits That You Will See,"If the views out to the ocean, the stunning architecture and the gorgeous flowers and plant life are not enough to feed your soul, don't worry. There is an art exhibit for everyone! No matter what type of art or art history that you appreciate, you are likely to find one instillation at speaks to you. Don't miss. Just be certain to make a reservation because only a certain # of visitors are allowed per day."
World class,"This is a world class museum, with absolutely no entrance fee.  There is a parking fee, $20 before 3pm, $15 after...so load up the car and go!Even if one does not love art there is so much to see:  gardens, beautiful outdoor architectural forms, views of LA and the ocean below.  Plenty of place to take little kids to run around while some of the adults visit the museum. The collection is amazing.  Truly amazing in its diversity.  One can always see something new. Go!  Go!  Go!"
Get to the Getty,"This museum complex is incredible. The buildings, the exhibits, and the gardens are inspirational. The cafe offers amazing food choices. Spend an enjoyable day admiring the exhibits and the magnificent overlook views."
Getty Center,The Getty Center is a must see museum.  The architecture is breathtaking. You are able to look out over L.A. from different observation points. There are so many things to see and tours to go on you could spend the day there.  And admission is FREE.
"Beautiful Views, Decent Art & Yummy Cafe","Going to the Getty Center is free except for the cost of parking which was $15. You take a tram from the parking structure to the Getty Center. The grounds are made up of multiple buildings that are not connected. There is a gift shop in multiple buildings. The Manet exhibit was there when we just went. It was nice, but small. Having the Art Institute of Chicago in my own backyard is hard not to compare most places to the gorgeous art museum I have.  But free is free so it met my expectations.This place is great and you will take awesome pictures from here. I can see how being here on a nice sunny summer day would be relaxing and fun.The cafe/cafeteria has many good and healthy food options. It is pricey where I would say that it will cost you around $20 a person including a drink. There is a very expensive restaurant that you can also book a reservation through that has beautiful views of Los Angeles.Definitely go here for a visit if you are from out of town. Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours here to see everything."
"Amazing views, some practical advice","Great place to visit, Some practical advice. Parking can be a horror, we were there over christmas and spent 1 hour just to get into the parking house. In hindsight, we shoulc have choosen the outside parking before driving under the bridge. You will also need to wait for the tram transport. Dress for at least a  20 minute wai if crowded. Limited avaliability of snacks and food in the museum in the afternoon (at least during holidays). All in all, with waiting for parking and tram transport, it took a bit more time than we planned. The museum and the gardens are beautiful."
Manet Exhibition,A comprehensive and wonderful exhibition showing some early works and his latter works. His paintings of vases along with portraits displayed Manets’ diversity of subject.  A must see!
The Getty Center Is A Must-See for L.A. Visitors,"We've lived in L.A. for years and have visited the Getty Center many times. It's a go-to for bringing any out of town visitors. Beautiful location, great views and great exhibits."
Great place to visit,This is a free museum (though you will need to pay for parking) with world-class arts.  the architecture is beautiful and the location gives your a nice view of LA.
Awesome Art!,"This is a beautiful vault for world class art.  If you have not been it is well worth the time.  In addition to the art, the grounds are well worth your time.  The view of LA is great on a clean day or night."
Great Museum and most everything is free!,"I loved this museum, beautiful artwork, architecture, gardens, views and best of all it is free!! The only things that costs money are the parking and it’s only $20 for a car and food if you buy it there. They have gorgeous gardens that you could bring your own picnic to if you don’t want to buy food. The collection of art is eclectic and every one in our group from 4 years old to 40 years old was enthralled by the collection. This was definitely a highlight of our road trip to LA and I’d recommend it for any age visitor."
Wonderful afternoon,The exhibits are all you might expect. The restaurant is average plus. The gardens and views are spectacular.
Beautiful Landscape,This place is beautiful and a relaxing place to visit. Thankful for the tram because the walk up is long.
great views in a tranquil setting with enough interesting art to make it worthwhile,"The Getty has some of the best architecture in LA.  best viewed as the sun sets off the various stones that make up the buildings and gardens.  The gardens are worth the trip. the art varies if there is a special exhibit.  otherwise its, interesting but not outstanding.  What is outstanding is the architecture of the complex and the gorgeous gardens.  Best of all, the Getty is free to the public.  The only charge is for parking."
Very stunning place for views and art.,This museum is FREE!! There are great views of LA as well as several large galleries of different styles of art. I spent the entire afternoon there on New Year's eve and could have spent more time. I understand from friends that it was particularly crowded that day and often is very quiet.
Awesome..  Get away from LA,"If you want to spend a day or just a couple of hours, this s a great place to see.  The garden, architecture and paintings.  The staff is very friendly and do yourself a favor and take the free guided tours.  You will learn a lot about the history and life of the painters."
Best deal in town!!,"There's a reason why it's getting more difficult to visit the Getty Center -- where else can you spend the entire day (if you want) to see magnificent pieces of artwork in a beautiful setting for only $20?  Admission to the Center is free; just pay for parking, but if you visit the Getty Villa on the same day, you only have to pay for parking once!  (Two museums, one parking fee! - such a deal!!)  Get to the Center early, though, since the line of cars waiting to get into the garage can be very long!  The artwork is fabulous and the gardens are so peaceful and serene.  The Getty Center is truly a piece of heaven (no longer) hidden in the big busy and bustling City of Angels."
Excellent site to visit; go see Manet if you're in L.A. by Jan. 12,"This was our first visit to the Getty Center, and we'll certainly want to come back.  The current exhibit of Manet (only being shown a few more days) was the primary reason for the visit, and it was well worthwhile.    We wanted to have more time at the Getty, but other obligations prevented exploring the standing exhibits.      Price (FREE) makes the value all the more exceptional.    We also went because it was Trip Advisor rated as No. 1 in the L.A. metropolitan area-- and we couldn't agree more.    One cautionary note: the tram line can be intimidating -- it looked too long when we arrived (they estimated 20-minute wait), so we decided to walk (which they said would be about 15 minutes).  No one mentioned that it was an all uphill excursion, but we certainly got our steps in for the day."
Spectacular art and free,"Get here early! I was there at opening and it was almost empty. The first two hours were great strolling around and enjoying the art. At around noon there were huge amounts of people showing up and it felt a bit crowded. Parking is 20 dollars, but everything else is free which makes this a budget friendly place to visit. Many of the paintings are spectacular. When I was there the special was an impressionist artist called Manet. I preferred the other exhibitions."
Gorgeous! Fabulous! Must See!!!,"What a treasure-- and we, who are museum lovers-- were not disappointed by our visit here.  This was our one must see stop in LA, as we were in town for the Rose Parade.  We took the 'highlights tour' which was a great thing to do, as it gave us an orientation to all the buildings and exhibits.  We LOVED the Manet special exhibit as well as the photographs on display.  If we return to LA, we will return here."
"Spectacular views, impressive building -- but....","Went on a Sunday afternoon -- expect to take about 35 minutes from time you get in line to park till you are actually at the Center -- 15+ minutes in line to park, another 15+ to wait for the tram.  Tram right up is nice (you can walk --15 minutes and up a steep incline -- walking down is worth doing however.  Anyway, views are outstanding.  The building (s) are pretty impressive -- but, for the day I was there, the exhibits were average at best-- I am sure they change up but you might want to check to see what is being shown to see if you have interest.  I recommend but not as highly as many others do"
Beautiful Vista,"The architecture of the Center is gorgeous.  The actual art exhibits were not particularly impressive, but the views out over Los Angeles were great.  Gardens this time of year were not so great."
Very nice place if you are a patron of the arts,"Place has a good selection of paintings (Monet & Manet) and others from all the different ages. Also a good selection of sculptures. Very nice external gardens, worth a visit."
getty centre,one of the best place to see the art and many old heritage monuments. its free entry and need 2.5 to 3 hrs. nice view of LA
Does Not Live Up to the Hype,"Yes, the views are beautiful, but you can get the same views from many other easier to get to locations.Yes, the collection is renowned....but the galleries are poorly designed, in my humble opinion.  That's why I'm only rating The Getty Center as average...it's the poor gallery design does not complement the actual collection.The Getty Villa in Malibu is better, featuring the antiquities collection, or of course visit the renowned LA County Museum of Art (LACMA), Broad Museum or Museum of Contemporary art (MOCA), all of which I'd rate higher the The Getty Center."
To face magnificent art,"Everyone who has a chance to visit LA CA, must visit Getty Museum. It is absolutely magnificent place with gorgeous view, modern architectural design and endless examples of priceless art. The last time we have visited Getty to see beautiful paintings of E. Manet. It was great exhibition! I am sorry for all who missed it. We also visited the Museum’ Art exposition, which is also of incredibly high quality and value. It was windy and rainy day, but never the less we enjoyed every minute spent outdoor around the Museum."
Enjoyed This Cultural Gem,"I've visited L.A. many times, seeing the Getty center from the 405 and always wanted to visit. This time, I made it happen and so glad I did. The grounds are gorgeous, the views are spectacular, and the art inspiring. The tram from parking up to the museum is a fun way to start the day. We did find the buildings a little confusing to navigate because we wanted to visit specific displays before the crowds arrived. Kudos for keeping this museum free (other than the big city price to park).  You can also get the normal packaged sandwiches, salads, chips, cookies, etc. at the cafes. Choose to eat early or late to avoid long lines.  The cafes are not set up for quick service, but rather in a single-threaded line no matter what you want. It didn't seem to be super busy yet it took 20 minutes to get through the line, select our items, and pay.  TIP: If you go to the Getty Villa too, you can get a free parking coupon before you leave the Center. A recent study shows that museum, concert, and art center visits increases hour longevity!"
Restaurant (Cafe) mess,"Restaurant (Café) is confusing. We wasted 1 hour in this maze of people. They have self-serve (cold sandwiches and drinks) to the left as you come in. If ordering hot food you get a tray on the right side as you come in. They have hot items behind the glass partitions (and different lines) not clearly marked for everything. Be careful you are not in a ""pick up"" line rather than an ordering line. The people outside the glass are just as confused as you are so don't ask them for any instructions. You can ask the cashiers (if they aren't too busy. The food was acceptable. Just could have used better instructions......I hope this helps who ever reads this."
"Stylish, elegant and extravagant gallery!","The Getty is not just another art gallery. It's a bold and uncompromising statement even before you walk inside. Built on a vast scale, the several buildings all scream to be noticed; as bold as any Hollywood starlet. You can walk around and just admire the architecture and the brilliant views. The art, of course, is what attracts as well and even if you're not into modern art, you will probably be treated to one of the temporary special exhibits highlighting one or more masters from the past. We visited the exhibition of Manet's works and that alone was worth the effort. This is a very popular visitor attraction so allow several hours. Try to get there early. There is parking at the centre (US$20 in December 2019) but that's the only compulsory charge all day and great value considering what you get to see. There is a restaurant with a wide selection of food which is reasonably priced, considering the captive market they have. Finally, make sure to stroll through the grounds and soak up any available sun on the manicured lawns. If you want a relaxing and inspirational day out and appreciate fine culture and genius, you'll love this place. I highly recommend the guided tour to get a full insight into the design and history of the centre."
Getty Center,Great art. Wonderful views of LA including the ocean. The garden tour was great. Very informative. Highly recommend it.
Tremendous art and architecture,"The Getty Center is a terrific showcase of great art and architecture. The collections mostly focus on European paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts before 1900. They also have an impressive collection of manuscripts from the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Although the Getty is not an encyclopedic museum, there is certainly plenty of art to enjoy.Equally impressive is the overall campus, which features contemporary architecture, beautiful gardens, and stunning views of Los Angeles and the coast. Entry is free, though parking is $20 ($10 after 6 PM). They have a very nice (though pricey) cafeteria, a full-service restaurant, and a couple coffee carts in the courtyard.It's easy to spend several hours here if you're so inclined. Since it is very popular, it is best to get there early to get a decent parking spot and avoid crowds, especially on weekends."
"The best in contemporary architecture on a mesa commanding LA, and it's free!","Atop a mesa with a breathtaking view over Los Angeles, Richard Meier has built a complex of refined shapes in pale sandstone.  The gardens are also spectacular.  In the rather conventional galleries you will find a collection of American and Europoean art, mostly from the 19th and 20th Centuries.  There are amusing juxtapositions, such as a Maillol sculpture of a female nude next to a ""decomposed""  work by Magritte of the same subject. Entry is free: we paid only for parking and lunch.  One reaches the Center via a dedicated train."
Beautiful museum with great art and free!,"Amazing museum on beautiful ,park-like grounds with fountains and wonderful landscaping. We got there when it opened and people were pouring in. Lot was full in an hour. The art was wonderful, but it was striking to me that half the people there were there to hang out on the grounds rather than look at the art. It is astounding that this amazing resource is free. A must see in LA.."
Wonderful,"The architecture, the views, the art... all great in here. And it's free! I've been to many famous European art museums and the collection here is at least on par with a lot of them. Must-see in LA."
Highly Recommend!!,"The Getty is wonderful Museum/Gallery.  Go on the website to see what they offer.  We saw the Manet exhibit.  The entry is free, so if you get dropped off just enter the garage and take the elevator to the tram.  If you drive:  park your car in the Garage, pay $20 at one of the parking kiosks (You can pay before you take the tram up or after you come back,) then take the tram up to the best Art Museum you will ever see, and I have visited quite a few.  Reminder:  Check out the website before you go, and take several hours to enjoy.  They have some refreshments for sale in the courtyard.  Some folks took picnic lunches to enjoy on the expansive lawns."
"Amazing Art Collection, Fantastic Location","The Getty Center hosts permanent and changing art exhibitions in a world-class environment. Everything is beautifully displayed, grouped, and described. We spent over three hours with Manet, American 20th Century prints, and Balthazar, the third of the Maji who visited Christ in the manger. We ran out of time before we could visit several special shows and part of the permanent collections. We will go back again, not only for the art, but also for the stunning views of the California coast and the city of Low Angeles. Oh, and admission is free! You only pay for parking. What a deal on all fronts!"
Wonderful!,"The exhibit center and, especially, the grounds are gorgeous. And, the exhibits themselves are very interesting and engaging.  The cactus garden and the lights on the “weeping” trees are very beautiful.  We enjoyed a wonderful, lovely, visit.  Much preferred the Getty Center to the Getty Villa."
Outstanding world class art center!,The Getty Center has an amazing collection of artwork from Greece & ancient Rome in an extraordinary architectural facility worthy of a full day visit in its own right.
Don't miss this LA highlight,"There is a reason that TripAdvisor makes this the #1 activity in LA - the Getty has something for everyone.  It is a unique museum for its location and vast grounds.  With the biggest endowment of any museum, its collections and exhibits are always amazing.  Even the train ride up is a fun adventure.  If you want to see and enjoy the highlights of LA, the Getty should definitely be on your ""must-do"" list."
"Beautiful Architecture, Art & Gardens","Went to The Getty today and had a great time. Amazing architecture and gardens stand out as soon as you arrive and get even better the further you go in. Some great art displayed inside and the view up there is certainly the highlight. We went with a 8mth old in a stroller and a 6yr old and certainly felt welcome and it was clear the place was designed for the very young to the very old. Children will love the steppingstones across the water feature in the plaza and a run, roll or crawl on the lawn in the garden. Certainly worth a visit and it’s free!"
Saturday stroll,Come early if you want to see the place without ques.Nice stroll in the park and then inside the exhibitions.you can grab a coffee..but you cant take it with you inside
Don’t Miss It!,"The Getty Center & museum is amazing. The buildings and grounds are exquisite. At any given time there are several exhibits well worth seeing. The Manet exhibit (through 1/12/20) is extraordinary. Here is my useful tip for your visit. The museum opens at 10am. Get there by 9:30am so you can park easily and get the tram up to the museum before the crowds arrive. And they will arrive. Trust me you’ll thank me for this advice. Parking is $20., a bit steep. There is no additional admission fee beyond that. Car pool. Enjoy."
"Don't drive.  Traffic and parking nightmare. Uber/Lyft, mass transit","Had lunch reservations and had 45 minutes to get .4 miles.  After 35 minutes and .2 miles traveled, called the restaurant they stated I could have another 45 minutes after the original reservation.  I thought they were joking.   It took over an hour to get to the parking garage entrance.  Than another 20 minutes to park.  I sent my husband ahead but he was a minute or two late and they wouldn't let him in.   If I had ubered I could have been dropped at the corner and missed an hour and half of traffic.The views were very nice and the Manet exhibit was interesting  If you have lunch reservations aim for two hours before and look at exhibits and garden first.  The garden was closed due to weather."
One of the Best Places to be in So CA,"The structure, the view, the art collections, the store, the gardens, even the food ... The Getty Center makes for the most incredible day. It's simply iconic, and for good reason!"
Overrated enthusiasm,"Having visited many art galleries/museums in Europe, I think that I would be very disappointing if I had payed to visit it.The architecture of the buildings is much more interesting than the interior.I really enjoyed the ""Monet"" collection and the old American pictures.The gardens are very well maintained and can catch your attention.Very nice spot to take good pictures of LA.(was it helpful? give your vote)"
World class museum on a dramatic cliff top with unique architecture,"Rich museum reflecting the collection of one of the wealthiest men in the world, continues to expand and add new items and special shows, definitely worth a few hours of your time."
Pictures don’t do it justice ,"I’m the last person to be confused with an art enthusiast so I was little unsure about coming here beforehand but from the moment you step on the tram to head up the hill, you know it’s not just another museum. The architecture is amazing, the views are priceless and the artwork ties it all together."
Must visit ,"Incredible architecture, a lot of very old art and sculpture, in an amazing location. $20 for the parking is all it costs."
You don't have to like art to enjoy this,"We have limited interest in art but we loved this building, the glorious gardens and the fabulous views.We found the volunteers friendly and helpful.  We felt the soft drinks were expensive and didn't eat here.It was busy with school groups but they didn't seem to go into the various rooms holding the Fine Arts pieces or the paintings.  Afternoons are quieter.We liked the drawings of 1920's/30's America, the Balthazar exhibition and the hot air balloon chandelier intended to hold goldfish the best.The whole musuem is very well organised.  A great place to visit.."
Art lovers' delight,"We visited late Saturday morning. Lots of people were there but it didn't feel crowded. One special attraction was Manet's later works, which was interesting and informative. The group split up and I wound up in the European art section. We had only two hours to view the various works of art because we had reservations at The Restaurant on site. This is the ""fine dining"" restaurant, which is one level (in both senses of the term) above the cafe. The food and service there were both excellent (try the mushrooms in sherry cream sauce appetizer). The Getty is an outstanding museum with a wide variety of exhibits. One could spend all day exploring the facility. Admission is free, while parking is $20; so, a party of four is $5 each, likely the best bargain in musuemdom."
Spent a perfect afternoon here,This is a very nice place to hang out with friends. Nice view. Love the architecture and the artworks in the museum.
I haven't been recently,"The place is timeless designed by Ghery, Frank Lloyd Wright. The 1,000,000 square foot museum and acres of manicured gardens is FREE to visit - just call ahead to reserve parking. Do yourself a favor and allot more than one visit as you won't be able to ""do it"" in a day. Art from BC to Andy Warhol (TBC) ..."
MANET EXHIBIT!,"Don't miss this special exhibit of beautiful Manet paintings and drawings.  You'll also see some of his personal items and letters.  If you go on a breezy day, you'll have a wonderful view of the sea, Los Angeles, Westwood, and Santa Monica.  We've visited art museums all over the world and count the Getty among the best.  Their permanent collection is diverse, so when we go for their special exhibits, we also revisit sections of it as well.  The museum is free; parking is $20. Park and take the tram up to the Getty Center. There's a café, food/drink kiosk, several gift shops, and unusual gardens.  The architecture is spectacular."
Relaxing,"Parking is $15, but the museum is free. You get amazing views of Los Angeles from the top where Getty sits. They’ve got two stories of art and it’s pretty cool to look at, but I mostly came for the views. They’ve got plenty of sitting area so you can sit back and relax. They’ve got a restaurant and a cafe with quite the options to choose from. There’s an automated tram that takes you from the parking garage to the museum. It lasts about 4-5 minutes, if that. I went on a chilly day and it felt really nice. The building itself is pretty cool to marvel at."
A must see,The world class collection of art and its unique library is a must visit place in the world. It has one of the greatest art collections in the world from different times and places. There are also world class travel collections that change frequently. The location is also perfect for photography and to enjoy the city line view. There is an art crafts gift shop and a snack bar cafe (a bit overpriced) too. Highly recommend.
Excellent arts and view of the city,"We went 15 minutes before it opened and it was the best time to go, easy to find parking and no line to get on the tram. We spent two hour there enjoying the exhibit, the garden and the beautiful view of the city. Parking is 20 dollars if over an hour and museum is free."
Visit dirhams teens,This place is so beautiful as soon as you take the train to go up it endulges you into a special place. My 16th daughter didn’t  wanted to spend all day so this was just perfect for not a huge museum. The expos are really nice. the place is not big just perfect Beautiful  gardens and view.
"One, if not the best, cultural places to visit in all of Los Angeles","So much to see.  The galleries, the grounds and the architecture.  It is a don't miss place.Beautiful exhibits and excellent facilities and well kept garden"
The Getty,"What a place!  The design of the Getty incorporates the entire site, right from the underground parking to the museum’s pavilions.  The design is entirely consistent.  It was raining slightly and at the tram station, lovely cream coloured umbrellas were offered gratis to all visitors to get from one place to another.  There were great plastic bins to put them in when you were done.  The sculpture garden at the base of the mountain is beautiful and unexpected.  We visited at a time when wildfires were occurring at random and in unpredictable places.  One wildfire started on the hill immediately next to the Getty property.  The nearest highway ramp was closed until it was safe.  If you look up the hill from the lower sculpture garden, you will the blackened bracken of the adjacent hill.  It was incredibly close.  The main entry to the first pavilion is reached up a grand set of steps on which are mounted sculptures.  The scale is large, but somehow accessible.  When we entered, we thought the guided audio tour with headphones might be a good idea.  Not so much.  You have to follow in order the exhibits, but it might not be convenient to go in a straight line through the exhibits, and I ended up spending too much time trying to find the correct audio blurb.  The notes posted with the various exhibits are very good and easy to read, so we ditched the audio guides.  There are beautiful vistas to appreciate as you go from building to building.  The guards and docents are really helpful.  Do not hold back.  They can help.  We ate in the restaurant on site.  There is also a coffee shop eatery as well.  The restaurant was a welcome break with purple velour upholstered chairs and white linen. So comfy.  We enjoyed a lunch sized meal.  The wait staff were right there for you, very personable, pleasant and knowledgeable.  And the food was delicious.  Its the kind of place where you might spend the better part of a day."
Best of LA,I am a native Angelino and was so excited when the Getty opened.  I felt like it was the beginning of a cultural renaissance.  It has proven to be exactly that and so much more.  It is exquisitely beautiful.  The architecture and landscape are spectacular!  The art and ongoing events make it a special place to visit no matter the weather or time of year.
Worth visiting,We went to the Getty Villa in the morning then over to the Getty Center. Ask to have your parking ticket validated at both places and you only pay for parking once. Getty Villa is lovely. A fairly small scale site. Lots of tour options. I highly recommend getting a tour of some sort. The Getty Center has expansive grounds and several buildings. We took an architectural tour. I would go back to cover more of the grounds and buildings. Great views too!
Amazing,Great experience for all of us. We spent more 5 hours without feel tired. We did the architect tour and permanent exhibition and both the guides are amazing.
Definite must visit,"This truly an exceptional attraction in LA. Wonderful architecture, exhibitions, views, smart transportation- full of harmony and relaxation. Entrance is fee, parking 20 dollars. Go see it!"
The Getty Center,Beautiful exhibits and excellent facilities and well kept garden . Look out for the hummingbirds at the cactus garden.  Free entrance only USD20 for car park . Impressive collection that you don’t get to see everyday . A must visit if you are in LA.
BEAUTIFUL campus; not a lot of art,"The Getty Center is an oustanding, beautiful, campus of multiple buildings. Staff were always friendly and happy to engage. I was disappointed in the amout of art in each building: paultry by comparison to other museums in the US I've visited. I felt this was more like an appitizer size art museum, not a main course -- in terms of the amount of art available on the walls; disappointing actually. I was left with the feeling that all the hype for The Getty is the buildings and the mountainside views, not what's inside the buildings."
Superlative,"From the time of ascending by tram to descending hours later was a marvellous excursion through towering European art set in a stunning institution.We looked forward to the Manet exhibition, a unique opportunity to see so many different genres by the master. Jeanne (Spring), used to promote the event, is a gorgeous portrait of the young woman.Moving onto the permanent collections we saw captivating works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Renoir, Degas, Monet and additional pieces by Manet. A pair by the English artist Abraham Solomon were intriguing. Waiting for the Verdict shows the nervousness of a family at the trial of a loved one. Not Guilty portrays the palpable relief of all at the favourable outcome."
Can’t view it all in one day!,"I arrived around 2 pm. You do have to pay for parking at the Getty and there is no other parking options so be prepared.  I waited about 15 mins in line for the tram. The tram ride to the museum was a little shaky but the views were great. Once you exit the tram the grounds are sprawling. There is no right way to see the museum but definitely make sure to see the signature gardens, it’s a beautiful place. There was an exhibit about music and plants when I visited that was very interesting as well as an exhibit about color. There are standing exhibits with traditional paintings, pottery and statues. It is definitely a two day museum!"
Scenic Walk Retreat in the Heart of LA,"We loved the Getty! We only had an hour to visit, but you could easily spend 3-4 hours here! 1 hour and we were power walking through and didn't get to see as much of the magic that was here! I definitely recommend going here during the spring time so you can see all the beautiful outdoor exhibits and shrubs. Please keep in mind, it gets a little cold on the mountain/hill if you go when it isn't as warm as normal in LA. You have to ride a tram up to the museum (sometimes there is a slight wait) so please keep that in mind if you are under a time crunch. This museum is like an artist's funhouse! There is something different to see everywhere! Famous works are here and there are great views of LA as well! What a great place for all ages!"
Must de if you are in the Los Angeles Area ,We went with Friends to the Getty Center the day after Thanksgiving. It’s a wonderful Place where you can see a lot of Art that Paul Getty assembled along his life. We particularly like the Manet exhibition and the fact that you can have Lunch after or in between exhibitions. We loved it and recommend to anyone.
Oasis of European sophistication in LA,"Art, architecture and landscaping crafted together.  Extraordinary permanent art collection a sampler of European art.  But the best picture is looking south over LA."
Great place to visit.,We visited here with our kids and grandkids and we all loved all the different things they had to see. We were there  a couple of hours and still didn’t see everything! Definitely a place to go and visit if your in the L A area.
Beautiful ,Great way to spend a rainy L.A. day. Really enjoyed it and the architecture of the building itself is spectacular with wonderful views of the city.  I didn't even mind paying the $20.00 to park. Not bad for two people when entry into the museum is free.
Not to be missed,"I can’t say it enough, this place is a must while you visit LA.The architecture, the art, the landscape and the views; they are all breathtaking. The center sits on the mountains of Santa Monica, the architecture is modern and there is a feeling of spacious and a game of light, especially if you visit at sunset.It’s a combination of best art at the different galleries, panoramic views of the city, manicured gardens with different sculptures. I didn’t eat at the restaurant but I heard it’s great as well.You can spend a whole day here. I will definitely come back."
Manet and the gardens,"Go if you can, you will love it. Easily accessible by public bus - worth a day to wonder though the extensive exhibits, enjoy the manicured gardens and the architecture."
Go to The Getty – just go. You can thank me later :),"Oh. My. God. This place is amazing. Such a zen-feeling in the hills away from the bustling city with art, architecture and views that will leave you speechless. If you think this is just a museum it's a big fail. Cause this is a massive compound with something to see at every step you take. My wife and I spent 2,5 hours here but we could easily have spent an extra hour. It's free admission but you pay 20 dollar in parking. And you have to take a special tram or cart from the parking lot uphill to the main entrance. Enjoy!"
A must!,"Plan on several hours, beautiful art, fabulous views. Take a bus or park at the base of the hill and take the free tram up. Be ready to take lots of pictures!"
Great place.,Great place. Love the water features and everything else around the area. I would recommend that people come early and bring water.
Like being in Heaven,You feel like you are in heaven when up there on a clear day. The tram takes you slowly up to this mountain top retreat with spectacular views of the entire west side of LA. Great Art collections as well.
Superb!,"So worth a visit! We were there at a time when the special exhibition was about Eduard Manet, which was fabulous, as were all the other temporary displays. The architecture of the center itself and the views it allows the visitors are spectacular. The only downside was the cost of food and drink in the cafe/restaurant, f.ex. 8.50 dollars for a small bowl of soup and 1.50 for a tiny roll to go with it.The parking charge of 20 dollars is easily justified, as the center is free to enter."
"Lovely, Inside and Out!","Primo Art, Architecture, City View, Gardens ... Be sure to add in about 10 min. of tram time upon arrival and departure.  So Lucky that the Museum and Tram are Free!  (Although Parking is Extra.)"
Getty this!,"Went to the Getty with my family while I was in Los Angeles and we had a ball. It was something fun for my mom, my sisters and the children. Three generations together and learning about art and history. After you visit the Getty you also have to visit the Getty Villa but don't do it in the same day. We also enjoyed lunch also."
Incredible collection of art and amazing views,The Getty museum is beautifully designed with four main buildings surrounded by gardens sitting high above the city offering incredible vistas.  You pay for parking but there is no entrance fee.
Getty Galore + Manet Exhibit,"The Getty holds the master gems with such splendor and grace.  The Getty's architecture and landscape is breathtaking with mountain views and manicured sculptured gardens.   The artwork was as beautiful as works found in the Louvre, Petite Palaise, L'Orangerie, Prado, and  Riena Sophia.  The layout of the museum is very manageable. I was impressed with the Manet exhibit.. what a treat!"
Getty visit.,"Very cool, nice ride to the top. NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR LITTLE KIDS (0-12). Fun activities and very windy."
Lovely day spent ,Great day! Did the Garden tour and the Architecture tour. Both were great. The garden is truly an experience :)
Too many artifacts ,"This is a must do in Los Angeles. The maze is beautiful. Top of the hill, you can see the whole city from here. The museum has lots of artifacts from ancient era. I just like to go thr for its charm."
A Museum Gem,"The Getty is a very impressive museum.  From the moment you drive in and park, then realize there's a special scenic canyon tram that whisks you from the parking area to the museum campus, you realize this will be a very enriching experience.  As you disembark you realize you've entered a true campus of buildings and exhibits that all are worthy of your attention.  The artistic riches from Dutch Masters to amazing domestic all stars is really amazing.  The outdoor ""mall"" atmosphere allows you to navigate from different exhibit themes an easily access them under the sunny skies of L.A.  When you feel like a break, you can traverse the amazing walkways and adjacent gardens that adorn the exterior space -- a museum of Mother Nature -- with floral displays that truly make you pause and say, where is the true art -- inside or outside. This is a real gem for the L.A. metro experience and you could spend a full day and still not see it all... really a very special art (and outdoor) museum experience.  You will want to visit more than once (not a ""one and done"" destination)."
Less than I expected ,While the Getty is renowned and was nice it was much less than I expected. What left me underwhelmed was that the stately and cavernous exhibit galleries where modestly furnished.  It had a lot of nice exhibits but I expected more.
buildings are very nice,buildings are nice to look at along with the gardens. the views are to die for. We were asked to step back from a painting rudely when we were standing 1.5 feet away.
Los Angeles  MUST!,"What a lovely place! Please make sure you have at least few hours to spend there. They have very interesting offer of exhibitions.  Unfortunately I had only 2,5 hours so and I have decided to see gardens and enjoy astonishing view. Sunset seen from the place - breathtaking!  Very interesting architecture, lovely plants. It is one of the best LA  places.  I will definitely be back there."
Stunning inside and out,"I would skip the guided tours.  On your own, you can explore the gardens and architecture to your heart's content.  (Quite often, the outside of the Getty tops whatever the exhibit is inside:-)Great for lunch too!"
The best museum in town ,"Trying to explain what this amazing  complex you can imagine an Art Acropolis up on the LA's hills. It was carefully projected in 1997 by Richard Meier, arquitect who won the most important prize in the world. if it's possible combine another day with the Getty Villa."
Must see The Getty Center,Huge. All day event. Sprawling so it’s not crowded. “The Restaurant “. Provides fantastic service and the best food. The complex is a place well worth everything.
Incredible Museum With a Lot to See,"This is a huge museum with many sections. Each section with it's own theme. There is a lot to see here. A lot of exhibits. This is probably the best museum in the LA area. Parking here is expensive. You park your car and take a tram up to the museum. If you have a military ID (active, retired, ect) then when you are ready to leave the museum, go to the help deck and show them your ID. They will give you a voucher for free parking. It will save you $20."
The building and the garden make an impact,"The tram ride up and then that beautiful building with crazy views make this a LA museum.  I have seen much better art work in many other museums but the gardens and the views make this museum special.  I love to follow ""the water"" flowing through the museum."
"Education, art and architecture above LA.","It had been about 13 years since I last visited the Getty Centre. The visit is free except for the $20 parking fee. A shuttle takes you to the top of the hill from the parking lot which drops you off in the plaza entrance. The steps which lead the visitor from the plaza to the buildings are “elephant steps” - deep and wide to gently guide you to the main level. There are complimentary tours available - we chose the architecture tour - and from there, you can enter any of the other pavilions to view the extensive art and sculpture on view. There are some food options should your visit turn into a lengthy one requiring some sustenance. The sun shines brightly on the pale stone buildings, so don’t forget your sun protection. There is also a garden to enjoy some quiet time when the art becomes overwhelming. Highly recommended for the entire family."
Most spectacular museum of art work & photographs,"The architecture, the exhibits & the tour are worth spending a lot of time to absorb what this center has to offer,  like none other that i have visited."
Dine out and stay for the art! ,"I love being able to stop in the middle of a  fabulous day of art, at a world renowned museum, for delicious food, incredible drinks and an elegant atmosphere! Did I mention there are wonderful views of the city as well? This is fabulous for a light meal, brunch or dinner! Enjoy the magic!"
So much to see!,"What a treasure this place is; so much to see and enjoy! The history, the art and gardens were so enjoyable. There was so much art work from centuries and so much history to immerse ourselves, that we ran out of time. Plus, in the courtyard, the live music and presentations just added to it all. Plan an all day visit."
Wonderful view and art,Loved our visit. Gorgeous view. Calm setting. Beautiful art collection.  Highly recommend a visit. Interesting information available and beautiful as well.
Amazing place with amazing art.,"Feels like you're in Europe. Some of the most famous artists are on display: Van Gogh, Degas, Monet, and many more. The campus is a like a world class university located in the hills of Westwood. Can't believe we have that place in LA and it's free."
Art & Architecture  Win / Win,"I must agree with other reviews as a must see and the staff is super friendly.  There are self and guided tours.  I read a previous review and they are spot on with the guided tours.  It is interactive and you may learn things you did not know.  As they say you get what you put into it.   The garden and views are spectacular.  For just a short time you feel away from LA, which is sometimes a good thing. It is a all welcoming place, couples , family and kids."
Amazing center.,"Amazing center. Will go again. More to see that I could fit into a day. The grounds are beautiful, personnel were kind and informative. Just a great day (and it was even raining)."
Great place! An LA must see!!! ,"The Getty Center should be on everyone’s must do list in LA! Whether you’re a local or visiting from out of town, the Getty center is an absolute dream to visit! Whether you’re seeking a little art and culture, or simply to enjoy some peaceful green space, the Getty center has it all! I love to take all my out of town guests there, regardless of the special shows on display, there’s usually something for everyone to enjoy checking out. Plus you can’t beat the breathtaking architecture and panoramic views that on a clear day stretch to the ocean. There are also live free concerts and family events, and delicious cafe and cafeteria where you can enjoy a reasonably priced snack and glass of wine, beer, or cup of coffee. As an added benefit, you can choose to walk up or down to the museum from the parking structure if you don’t want to wait for the tram, or simply want the exercise. It is truly one of the most civilized, beautiful places in LA! Go on line to check their schedule of art shows and events."
Getty Museum,"I have been there multiple times over the past several years. Once with a middle school field trip, once with family and twice or three times with out of towners. The museum is well laid out with a good mix of art. Depending on when we’ve been there, the visiting/temporary art shows have varied in quality. But the whole place is so inviting and lovely, it has always been worthwhile. The parking is easy. The grounds are beautiful. The restaurants have good food. The views of Los Angeles are excellent from the upper levels of the museum. The bathrooms are clean and easy to find. The staff are helpful. All in all a good place to visit to inspire and soothe your artistic souls."
Oh the edifice complex,Irony abounds here with bundles of obscene Getty foundation cashflow building an appropriately dead modernist edifice with much many odd looted bottom fed masterpieces where the pretense is to become cultured at the expense of ill gotten gains being legitimized but alas enjoy the sunshine and enough italian marble to fill a ship or two from Italia where much of the art was looted from.....the skinflint namesakes bust is somewhere near the entry....2nd rate museum above the $)% 405 freeway.
Great fun with a little walk and wait for kids,Most folks with kids will love the Getty center. There is a great cafe upstairs and a wonderful family cafe with a nice patio downstairs
A Must See When Visiting LA,"This is a 'no-brainer.' The Getty has one of the most extraordinary collections in the world. The Getty Villa, the former home of J. Paul Getty currently houses the Hellenic statuary, which is one of my favorite aspects of the museum. While the villa was being renovated, you could see the Hellenic Collection at the Getty Center so it was like getting two bangs with one buck. But going to the Center itself is an adventure. From the tram ride up the hill, and being greeted by docents as you exit the train - ""Welcome to the Getty"" - the grounds and gardens are very special and a great place to just look out over parts of the city. The food is good in the various restaurants albeit sometimes spendy if you're on a budget, but the free admission more than makes up for food costs. There's usually a specific photographic exhibit, along with rooms and rooms of Renaissance art by painters and sculptors you've heard and read about in any art history course. Parking used to be free but it appears they're charging now. Still, you can see in an afternoon at The Getty much of the world's greatest art by its most renown artists, and in between dream about what life was like, both for the artists, and their subjects."
Great exhibition,Wonderful displays at the Getty. Something around every corner. This is a must see for all who visit or live in LOS Angeles.
Beautiful,"Beautiful, amazing location, so much history.  One of the best museums in LA, good for all ages.  Highly recommend."
Great Location,"The collection of art here is minimal depending on how many European and American galleries you've been to.  What is delightful is the architecture, the outdoor sculptures, and especially the gardens are worth the trip.  There are free guided tours - and I highly recommend them.  We took a walking tour of the garden and the docent was knowledgeable and genuinely enjoyed sharing her love of the space."
Brilliant,"Spectacular surroundings n art collection,all to see for free! Highly recommend it. Enjoyed the ocean views as well..."
Very Nice,"It is a beautiful place with lots of different type of arts. We enjoyed visiting and our kids really liked it. Nice staff, clean and very organized"
Who says LA has no culture,Wonderful setting and many pieces of historical value in addiiion to simply beautiful.  Easy parking which is unusual for anything in LA - Awesome views towards downtown
Great day at Getty Center.,"If you have friends or family coming out of state to visit California, the Getty center in LA is way to go.  You only pay $20 parking and tram will take you to the Getty center for free. There, you will find so much art, history, sculptures, gardens, gift stores, and much more.  From the top of Getty center,  you could enjoy the gorgeous view of the city and Pacific Ocean.  Don’t forget your camera! In such peaceful environment, you could spend entire day with your friends, relatives or kids.  Besides, you will always find snack stand on premises or stop by at their cafe to enjoy the variety of delicious food."
Great times at the new Getty,I've been to the new Getty several times and enjoy both the changing colelctoin and the views from the top of the mountain.  You simply cannot beat the good vibrations you get from being on the gruonds.
Parking is $15 for the day what a great deal.,"What a great place to grab a bit to eat, take in the view of the ocean and embrace art and culture!  I met a coaching client here. I chose this location as my client said,"" I always wanted to go to the Getty but never found the time."" Well, I made time during our coaching session and brought lunch for us. You can also enjoy the cafe carts as well.If you stay for 50 minutes parking is free!"
Great place,The Getty is filled with fine art from Rembrandts to Monet & Van Gogh. Don’t miss the fine photography exhibits on the lower floor of one of the buildings. Plus great views of LA
Escape from LA,"Whether you live here or are visiting, do not miss the Getty. I have visited it off and on since it opened almost 20 years ago and love it even more every time. The gardens are not to be missed, the views are epic and the collection is top notch!"
A trip to Italy,"The setting of the museum was so very restful,  The grounds are a Italian  villa, the restauent is very nice and reasonably priced and the art first class"
A must see when visiting LA,"Amazing achitecture & museum.Beautiful gardens.Free entry.Does get crowded on weekends, so plan ahead."
"amazing buildings, ground and art","This sits high above LA with a grand view...free to visit. The architecture is fabulous, gardens beautiful and the art and collections are fantastic. Highly recommend a visit up there. Others I have spoken to all said the same."
A trip into the ancient times,"Completely restored, the Getty is a must see if in LA , the reconstruction of the Ancient Rome times is perfect , the villa the patio the colors as they really were, a great experience"
"The one place we ""must see"" in LA","So much to see and there's only so much you can absorb in one visit. We gave it most of a day and need to return after suffering cultural overload.  Lovely, relaxed atmosphere and lots of light coloured traventine stone - take your sunglasses!"
A must see place,"This is a great place for everything, even if you are not into art, the place is awesome and the view is amazing. Great for a day out!"
Lots To See,"We visited both The Getty Centre and The Getty Villa in the same day, if you do this you only pay $20 to park, and this gets you into both places, which is really good. There really is so much to see at The Getty Centre, the collection dates back to the 12th century, there's lots of Renaissance Paintings, Golden Age Dutch and Flemish, 18th Century European Art, and a very good Impressionist Section, as well as lots of ceramics and silverware. We were very impressed with the collection."
The Getty,"Really enjoyed visit. The transport to the museum works well from car park. The building is spectacular and amazing views to the Ocean. I was little under whelmed by the exhibit,s. Maybe just wrong time the Manet had not opened."
Amazing place,"Great for viewing both art and architecture. The wide collection of art is quite fascinating. I highly recommend going on a highlights tour with one of the guides. They are very informative and make the experience very interesting. The architecture of the Getty is also very interesting and I got to learn more about it by joining the architecture tour. There is also a tour of the gardens, which are beautiful and of course you can experience them on your own. All in all a must visit when in LA. It is also completely free! You only have to pay 20$ for parking."
Not to be Missed!,"Well worth the effort to travel to the Getty and time one is in LA. A beautiful environment to relax, stroll, meet friends and just hang out! And Its Free!"
"We concur with the 11,619 Excellent reviews! ","We visited the week before the current Getty wildfire in the area; our thoughts go out to all those affected and to the brave firefighters. Our visit on 10/19 was absolutely wonderful. If we lived in the LA area we would visit every month!We found the atmosphere of the grounds relaxing and calming. Sure, it can be crowded at times and in certain places, but there are still quiet areas (both inside and outside) to be found.  Seeing the current Manet exhibit was a special treat. There’s a reason that The Getty is rated No. 1 on Trip Advisor...it’s a special place."
One of best highlights of LA,"Only wish we could’ve had more time here. Excellent art, architecture and gardens. A remarkable place and apart from cost getting there and car park, there is no entry fee."
"So little time, so much to do!","Loved this place.  If you love art and museums, this is a must-see. My only warning, plan for 4 or more hours.  So much here!"
A Must When in LA,"I highly recommend a visit to the Getty when in LA. It is located outside LA. You will see it from the highway. This was our 2nd visit. Admission is free but you pay for parking. The parking & trolly up to the Getty & back to the parking facility are well organized.  Take advantage of the many free guided tours that are offered as they enhance the experience. Enjoy the lovely grounds & views. It was a cool, sunny, but quite windy, day when we were there. I think the restaurant is certainly worth a try (although I liked my meal better the previous visit). One can easily spend the better part of a day here. Enjoy!"
Getty is a must if you are visiting LA,The gardens alone are worth the visit. The landscape and the fountains are amazing. Whether you like art or not you will enjoy it. Take a picnic and enjoy the view.
Well worth a visit,"After a short scenic route up the hill on their tram you reach this marvellous (free of charge) museum. Parking is available but I took a cab there. I would recommend that you make use of their self guide headsets as you can pick and choose the pieces which you want to learn more about (you will need to leave your ID with them as a deposit, if you are on holiday like I was they will just make note of your passport details and hotel contact information). I particularly enjoyed the garden and surrounding sculptures. They have an amazing view across LA. Thank goodness they provided umbrellas for shade as it was a baking hot day. Snacks are fairly expensive so bring enough cash, they also have a restaurant if you prefer a whole meal. The Getty is well worth a visit and you need about 3 hours to enjoy it."
Amazing!,Loved everything about the Getty Center.The permanent exhibits are first rate and I loved the featured Manet exhibition.The facilities are beyond first class. The admission and self guided audio tour are free. The only fee was $20 for parking.Food in the cafe was excellent and reasonably priced.My wife loved the museum shop.Just GO!
Breathtaking Views and VIP Service ,"For the price of parking, this otherwise free museum is astounding. The local is easy to navigate with assistance from staff. Best views of the LA basin from the south side of the building. The contents of the museum vary according to the timing of your visit. I was particularly interested in the Galle Chandelier. Expertly shown with low lighting perfect for photos and beautifully accompanied information. This place is a must see just for the views alone."
Worth the effort,"After visiting the Getty Villa we decided to drive over to the Center and see some of its offerings. The parking we had paid for at the Villa covered parking at the Center. Just had to ask for a voucher from the info desk at the Villa.From the Center parking lot there is a free tram up the hill to the museum campus. A fun and easy way to get uphill.It was worth going there just to see a wonderful temporary exhibition of Manet paintings, etc. In addition, there were a couple-few more permanent exhibits we had time and energy to enjoy. And the grounds were an added reason to visit. A supurb, world class museum."
What an amazing total experience!,"The Getty Center is more than worth it!! When parked the car, you should take the tram to the Getty Center! Discover the amazing exhibitions spread out on the 5 different rooms! After, take your time to enjoy the beautiful garden!"
The Getty,"It's one of the most important museums in LA (as far as I know) and the entrance is free. (You only pay for parking). They have a wide range of art Rembrandt, El Greco, Monnet. A little of everything. For some reason, I really enjoyed the furniture exposition above everything else. Worth going. (They eve borrow you umbrellas if it's raining)"
Stellar gallery,"Loved our visit here. Excellent views over LA, great mix of art housed in a fabulously designed space.The gardens are stunning & the building is worth s tour on its design features.Parking costs $20 & great train runs you up & back."
exelent,best tour ever with Zlata  She is best Very knoweledge  Easy to understand  I visit a C Monet what is beutiful    garden fantastik  and french music
Spent part of saturday,"Great museum.  Location, set up, collection, etc.  We did not spend enough time as you would need two full days to see the entire facility.  We took the collection highlight tour and it was very informative."
As brilliant as everyone says,"You won't be disappointed in the Getty Museum. Set aside three hours for a visit, perhaps a bit more for lunch on the premises. A world class collection of art, free tours, enticing gardens, and incredible views make this museum an LA favorite. I was particularly impressed by the quantity and quality of the descriptions mounted next to the paintings, sculpture and fine furnishings. Nearly every piece in the entire museum had a detailed explanation of its significance! I dined in the cafe, which is pricey, but portions are large and offerings are varied with many healthy options. There is a grab and go section for those who would rather get back quickly to the art. The docent on my tour about the life of JP Getty was a substitute and not effective or well-informed, but I appreciated the fact that the Getty offers free tours on a variety of subjects throughout the day."
The Amazing Getty Center!,"This place is amazing if you've never been there before.  It's free but you do have to pay $20 for parking.  They do offer a special price of $15 for parking if you arrive after 3pm.  Once you arrive you have to take a trolley to the top to see the Getty Center.  Once you arrive I would recommend going into the main visitor building and watch a short (about 10 minutes) film about the Getty Center.  I found it helpful to plan my visit and I would recommend taking one of the many different free tours they offer.  I took the architecture tour that lasted about 45 minutes and it was very interesting and you learn a lot about the thinking behind the mind of the creator of the Getty Center.  He had some very interesting ideas on how it would be built and you will look at the buildings different after taking this tour.  Right now they have a Manet exhibition that opened recently that you can enjoy and you're allowed to take pictures too (not with a flash though).  Also, if you look at the stairs walking up to the Manet exhibition you will notice they have painted the stairs to make it look like 1 large painting...very nice.The center is opened from 10am to 5:30pm Monday - Friday and 10am - 9pm on Saturday.  They are closed on Mondays.  I believe the last trolley ride down to the parking garage is at 6pm Monday - Friday.  If you want a nice view of the 405 and the wine vineyard across the highway you can get one from one of the overlooks.  They take you there on the architecture tour but I think you can walk to it without being on a tour.A must to see is the main garden at the Center.  It's really neat and offers many different types of flowers and great views of the city below.  You are welcome to walk around on the grounds and lay out on the grass to relax.  They offer tours of the gardens that last about 40 minutes but I didn't take one.I would suggest eating before arriving because the food & drinks are expensive up there and I didn't find the taste worth the extra cost.  They have a nice gift store if you're interested in shopping.I spent about 3 hours at the Getty Center but could easily spent an entire day if not multiple days if you really are interested in the arts.  It's 6 different levels so wear comfortable shoes."
Great day out,On our way to visit Malibu beach we stopped in the centre. It was great. Like travelling back in ancient Athens & Rome.
"Wow, amazing","We had read about this and while I thought we may be underwhelmed by art, boy was I wrong.  There are rare pieces here and the surroundings, view, architecture are just amazing.  My 18 yr old son was curious to see this after the movie and although not his favorite, I think still appreciated this visit."
Must do,"Great way to combine the beauty of the landscapes and outdoors garden with museum visitEverything is free,the hospitality is very generous and professional"
Beautiful,"Gorgeous area! The art, architecture and gardens are AMAZING! The whole place is like nothing I have seen before. There are so many different things to look at within the buildings, different art exhibitions, and also historic art exhibitions. I could use a whole day here."
It's a museum.  It's a state-of-mind!,"The buildings, grounds, and views make this one of the most special places on the planet.  Tie in great art and some good restaurant choices, The Getty has to be the best place to spend a day anywhere!"
Wish I had a week to spend at The Getty,"We loved everything about this magnificent Center.  It is spacious, airy, comfortable and has the most interesting displays.  We loved the Manet exhibit and the Photography Area. I wish we had a bit more time to spend exploring."
Plan for longer than suggested,"This was a fairly last minute decision to go, so I didn't do enough research beforehand (like reading the TripAdvisor reviews) and went with ""highlights"" and the Getty website.  The most misleading thing to me was the suggested time allotment of 2-3 hours.  This is definitely too short unless you are going to walk the museum without stopping to learn anything.  I'm not knowledgeable on art and so took a collection highlights tour -- learned about and saw examples of what makes the art ""great"" or unique, but at an hour, it took up a lot of time, and wasn't really an ""overview"" tour, which was what I thought it might be.  As a result we only had time to wander about the second floor and on retrospect I wish we had either come earlier in the day, or just done the special exhibit on the Bauhaus and walked the garden.  We had a group of 5, (two families) so it was a bit more difficult to know how to see a lot, not lose each other and still keep everyone seeing what they were interested in.  I stayed with the tour, though it took longer (vs exploring other rooms while guide was speaking) because it was the most in depth information I had received and it was interesting and interactive.  So because there are a number of tours, I'd recommend at least 4 hours, plus there is travel time from the parking structure via tram to the center and that cuts into your time to look around.  Important to note is that the construction of the building can effectively block cellphone / text and so I'd suggest setting a meeting time and place before splitting up if you do so, rather than rely on messages in real time."
Return Visits Definitely Required ,"Visit starts with good secure parking @$20. Thereafter a tramway takes you to the top and the entrance plaza. Join an initial short tour to get an informative view of the layout and the architecture of this campus.The views of LA can't be matched. The architecture and design are mesmerising. Events are always taking place in addition to the galleries. Also, good food at reasonable prices in the cafe and the restaurant.The vast size of this complex can cope with the large visitor numbers."
Such an incredible treasure to the community!,"We drove up from San Diego to see the Bauhaus Exhibit in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus movement.  The exhibit was well composed with a good overview of the impact on foundational methods of art education over the past hundred years.My husband and I both the thought the depiction of the color wheel, primary/secondary/tertiary colors; color studies with ints, shades and hues; and the impact of colors relative to different backgrounds.... so interesting!!  Things we take for granted now were concepts created and communicated effectively starting with the Bauhaus.We were a bit disappointed with only two galleries being dedicated to the exhibit.  We felt that the exhibit didn’t really bring to a close what happened to the school and the people, except in the timeline at the beginning of the show.  Numerous people left the second gallery as we did, looking for the next gallery to see where/how the story concluded.The exhibit could have delineated about what happened to those who were nit able to leave Europe.  Numerous members from the Bauhaus were murdered by the Nazis in cities or in camps.  Tips for parking:  -when you enter an address in Waze, enter Getty Parking Structure (don’t just say The Getty)-it’s easiest to just drive to the lowest level and park.  -take your ticket with you and validate it when you get off the elevator when returning on the elevatorHave fun!!When leaving the Gerry and catching rhe team back to parking...lf the line is horrific, it’s a pleasant 20 minute walk down to the parking area if you walk rather than team it back.Enjoy!!"
Great Facility with fantastic art,The Getty combines the most fantastic museum experience with their collection of fantastic art. The days are gorgeous and the entire experience is great. A good way to introduce figity teens to an art museum experience.
Getty is Amazing,This is a fabulous museum with changing exhibits regularly. I especially enjoyed the Van Gogh show. The gardens are excellent as well
A Great Experience,"Was unsure if visiting the Getty would be good or just boring. IT was neither, it was Great. The grounds are spectacular and the exhibits are even better. All of the staff was helpful and informative. I would strongly recommend to anyone who has a love of art and nature"
Something for everyone!,This place is a world class museum and art center and its obvious to anyone who visits that it is a must see.
Beautiful place,"Beautiful architecture, art and garden. It’s just hard not to love the Getty. Visually stunning views. Really lovely garden. Water features are stunning. They have children activities which are very cute and interactive. There is so much knowledge to gain. People are helpful. Gets a little crowded. Overpriced food items. Bring snacks. Admission is free. You only have to pay for parking."
Beautiful views and lanscape,"This is truly a not miss site when visiting Los Angeles. The trees on the property were planted 10 years before the Getty Center was built, resulting in magnificent landscaping. Don't miss going to the Getty Center!"
Los Angeles and the Getty Center,"From the moment you enter the tram for your journey up the hill,  to the grounds, views and varying exhibits you will not be disappointed.   Enjoy the expansive views of the LA basin, enjoy a meal and spend time with the art world experience.  The Sunday summer concerts for kids is over the top fabulous"
A Must visit in LA,"Beautiful, free, awesome.. Just go, the views alone are worth it. I finally went after a few years of living in LA and I was missing out."
The Getty Center is the perfect place to spend a day.,"The Getty Center is the perfect place to spend a day. With its many pavilions, each housing a different type of art, there is always more to see. the photography exhibits are my particular favorite."
A great place to visit while in LA even if you don't love art,"A visit to the Getty Center is not to be missed when you visit Los Angeles. It is worth it to roam the grounds and enjoy the garden even if you are not an art lover. On a clear day to can see all the way to the beach in one direction and all the way to downtown LA in the other. There are lovely place to sit. There are places to sit and sketch. I think it should be on the ""short list"" for every LA visitor."
Don't Miss The Getty,"This is such a beautiful location above the freeways of Los Angeles, with views to the ocean. You must park your car and then take a train ride to the Center, and kids love this. The Museum is fabulous, or you can just spend the day in the amazing gardens and grounds. The restaurant is excellent, but requires reservations. However, the other food option is very good too, very casual, cafeteria trays, perfect for kids, with lots of selections."
Awesome Museum,One of the great art collections! A must see. I finally made it. The team ride up to the museum is a great start for the museum visit. Many different guided tours help you to focus on different aspects of the collection. Plan to stay for a whole day..the views from the museum are stunning and architecture of the place makes you feel connected to the arts and the landscape.
Art art art!!!,"For a minimal parking fee, you can literally spend all day in this amazing art museum.  Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Rembrandt, thousands of others.....so very very very social to see all of these famous art works.  Very nice botanical gardens as well with lots of flora and fauna spread amongst manicured paths.  Very enjoyable day."
Great spot to visit for locals & visitors,"I took advantage of having a friend visit to finally check out the Getty and I was so impressed. None of us are much of art lovers but you don't even have to be to appreciate this place. The grounds and architecture are beautiful and interesting. We took an architecture tour to learn more about it. It's free to visit and even the tours, offered multiple times a day, are free. We did check out the main exhibit while visiting - very interesting. I would certainly return with visitors in the future.. or maybe even for a picnic on my own!"
Calm and beautiful ,A beautiful space with a huge collection of stunning art. I can recommend the free headphone tours that allow you to learn more about many of the exhibits.
Inspiring museum with a view,"The Getty is a great place to visit. Different exhibition’s, nicely designed building and the view overlooking LA is stunning. Highly recommended.Free access, parking 20$ per car."
Really nice day,not very easy to get to on public transport from central Hollywood. The gardens were my favourite and it was not expensive to eat there. Lovely views.
Beautiful!,Plan to spend a few hours here. It's incredible that this place is free. The grounds are amazing and the art is spread over 5 connected buildings. It's almost all European but still impressive. The walk from the parking lot up to the museum was enjoyable but longer than expected - take the free tram and save your legs for standing on marble. Employees are all very enthusiastic and friendly.
A Museum you shouldn’t miss,"The museum itself is gorgeous. It is located on the top of the hill, and Anshu electric train is taking you up there. The views are great, and in a nice day ( and there are plenty of nice days in LA), you can view all the way to the ocean. I am not crazy about their regular exhibits, but they have plenty of special exhibits, and the garden in beautiful too."
What a gift. Thank you Getty. Wealthy people giving back have preserved the Arts. Keep America Great.  ,What a gift. Thank you Getty. Wealthy people giving back and making our world more beautiful. Keep America Great.
Incredible art center worth the visit!,"We really enjoyed this incredible art center, founded by Paul Getty as a memorial gather an incredible number of outstanding prices of art. The museum architecture is also worth the visit and you have to take a little train up the hill to join the esplanade and the museum pavillons.Multiple guided tours are proposed according to your interests. No entrance fee but a 20$ parking fee.  Coffee shop and museum shop available. Amazing gardens. I warmly recommend a visit ."
"An interesting day out, what’s not to like ","A very interesting educational and different day out, featuring a special event with free admission. There are beautiful gardens and with some unusual art, which is not for everyone but worth a visit as 1.3bn dollars was spent creating the space, which also has great views over the valley."
"Some wonderful stuff, some mediocre, but good experience overall","There are many aspects of The Getty Center to comment on:Parking - Easy and abundant.  $20 before 3pm.  Getting from parking to museum - By tram from the parking garage, frequent and comfortable, but at the end of the day, one may have to wait for some time for a tram to be available due to crowds leaving, especially on weekends.Signage - Truly terrible everywhere, outside and inside.  For example, the location of rest rooms, indications for how to get from one ""pavilion"" to the next, and how to reach the tram from the museum to leave the place at the end of one's visit are mysteries which are solved only by asking members of the staff who, admittedly, are to be found almost everywhere.  And those are just three examples. Gardens - gorgeous in themselves, and some really good sculptures dotted all over.  But the gardens' relation to the museum building, nor the sculptures' relation to the rest of the collection, is not evident.  It's like they're entirely separate things which were conceived completely independently of each other.The building - The parts that are travertine are wonderful, especially as to texture and to color.  But the parts that are not travertine are too white and often resemble 1960s office or hospital administration buildings.  The design is in parts inventive and in other parts boring and institutional.The collection - Some truly great works: Ensor's Entry of Christ into Brussels is one of the greatest works in the history of art, beautifully but incongruously displayed in a room dotted with sculptures which have absolutely no relation to it.  They paid $10 million for this a few decades ago, and it needs to be explained to viewers. Like: Why does the Getty own it?  What is its relation to the rest of the collection?  When we visited, viewers were totally indifferent.  Then, there's Pontormo's exquisite Halberdier, also poorly displayed and positioned, and viewed with indifference by passers-by, for which the Getty paid $35 million twenty or more years ago.  This was far better displayed for 50 years or more at the Frick before the Getty purchased it.  Finally, the Giacometti sculpture in the entrance hall is positioned disastrously against a wall where nobody notices it, and what is it doing in the museum anyway?  In general, the arrangement of the collection is either extremely conventional or has no taste and often no rationale.  On the plus side, all the works are well lit and positioned mostly at eye level for easy viewing.Mostly, it's less-than-top-class works by major artists, like Monet, Cezanne, Corot, Manet, Rembrandt, Sisley, Pissarro, and so on.  We loved the little Degas self-portrait; the Parmigianino holy family; the magnificent Rosso Fiorentino on loan from the LACMA; the Watteau Italian commedia dell'arte players, the largest work of Watteau we've ever seen; the Chardin still lifes; the Turner view of Rome; the Caspar David Friedrich Walk at Dusk; the Rubens sketches: the Goya bullfight: Millais' The Ransom; an exquisite Pietà by Fernando Gallego whom we had never heard of.  It's not a comprehensive collection.  It's a mishmash.  An interesting mishmash, with some individual magnificent works, perhaps 20 or so, with the Ensor and the Pontormo and the on-loan Rosso Fiorentino topping the list.The other thing that astounded us was the literally unbelievably good condition of the majority of the works.  They have been vastly overrestored, in our opinion; they ""shine"" too much to be believed.  It's like somebody did them as paint-by-number.  Fine when it's a single example, like the Turner view of Rome, which the label says has been untouched since the artist painted it.  It's another thing with the less-than-top-quality Corots which look like someone put a coat of varnish on them to make them ""glow"".  This is not the case with the greatest works, but is the case with much of the less than first-rate stuff.The café is OK, spacious and quick, with a large and interesting selection of things.  It isn't cheap, however: a salad, a bowl of soup, a soda, and a brownie for $32 seems truly excessive.  Yes, the museum is ""free"", but .....The views, such as they are, are impressive.  We spent a good four hours on our first visit to the Getty, and we limited ourselves to the European paintings, the sculpture garden, the gardens in general, and the building.  We did not have the energy for any of the exhibitions, nor the entire ground floor with the decorative arts.  There was much to see, and we enjoyed our visit."
