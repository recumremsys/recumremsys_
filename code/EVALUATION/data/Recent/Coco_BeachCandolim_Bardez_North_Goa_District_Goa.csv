A beauty spot but.......,A little bit of paradise in North Goa but unregulated & very polluted.The government just does not care.The locals tell me of how the fish stock has been decimated since the last 20 years.What a shame.And the DOGS!
Coco beach,Heard a lot about the famous coco beach !!!! To say it was a disappointment is an understatement the place wasn‚Äôt clean even by Indian standards we will not make an haste return
Day out trip,Went to coco coco with a dolphin trip with John's tours it was our second time here well worth the time
OK OK beach,"It was not very clean beach, but fine beach compare to others like candolim, etc.  This beach for taking boat for dolphin view. They charge 300/- per person."
coco,its has nice place and if you visit 4 places from there and boat facility are also available and 300 rs per person you should pay for this
Small & Good beach!,Coco beach is not big and so famous as like other beach of Goa yet small and beautifully maintained beach!
Dolphinnnnn spotting,Ok. So two things! You do spot the dolphin and it‚Äôs a sight specially before 12 everybody we met came back happy! The counter for tickets is right there at coco and for 300 rupees you are taken for a boat ride and after dolphin shown the famous old jail and lighthouse! Worth the money but people need to be better! We enter dolphins territory and to see plastic bottles right in the middle of sea floating is disgusting ! please be a little responsible with your belongings in somebody else‚Äôs house:)
Nothing special,Beach. Too many boats for swimming. Only really a starting and departure pioint for dolphin spotting. Wouldn't go there otherwise
Nice,"We visited this place to experience the dolphin rides, not great but i was good experience. also get an sea view was superb!"
Where is the beach ??,"Coco Beach is crap !! There is no beach at all. No shacks, no place to eat. Not even golden sand. A place to be avoided."
Beach for Boarding fairy for Dolphin trip,Average location for boarding fairy for Dolphin trip. Nothing special about place. Cab driver Just take to this place to get their cut from fairy owners
nice beach for dolphin sight,"Nice beach for dolphin seeing.Go directly to the boats counter and buy a ticket, you can bargain if you have more persons with you. On the way you would find lots of people asking you to go for dolphin seeing, they get a commission when they take tourists to the counter."
dolphin ride coco beach,"very nice dolphin rides at coco beach with beautiful sea view , light house,bungalow which are given for shooting and all.lots of sea Shell's are there at coco beach nice place"
Dolphin trips!,"We went to Coco beach as it was recommended by our fabulous taxi driver. We had a boat trip which lasted around an hour. We saw some of the local landmarks, the fort, prison, and Millionaires villa which are along the coastline. We then went further out to see if we could find any dolphins....we did!  Loved the trip, wasn‚Äôt expensive and was fun!"
Boat trip to coco beach,"Got the boat from panjim, beautiful weather ,the fee for the trip Rs 1500 each (¬£17) , bargain on route were given free beer and food , journey took roughly 1 and half hours to get there, nearly all of us went into the sea for a swim it was brilliant, then we left there and went to another beach about half way back, they served us beautiful fish food and chicken great , left there and headed back to main land on route back everyone danced drank beer and rum what great fun we had , recommended this a must when you visit goa have a wonderful trip"
The beach has got washed away due to tsunami,This beach is now a dirty strip of sand as it has got devastated after tsunami. Now used as afternoon lunch stop after dolphin tour. There are shops selling usual merchandise but as for the view there is nothing to see.
Too comercial,"Too many boats, went to spot dolphins, had to wade through diesel filled water to get to the boat, then every time any dolphins were spotted all the boats converted on them at once resulting in the dolphins going back under the waves to hide"
Great for Dolphin sighting,"Had a marvellous time sighting dolphins, saw a dozen of them. took a tour at about 10 am on a week day, though the trip lasted for 35 min (they promised a duration of 45 min to 1 hr)"
5 in 1 TRIP,"A unique experience to enjoy Boat ride in the deep Sea with a fantastic view of the light house,Superb view of hill top Banglow of the Diamond king nice white view of the CHURCH and of course an awesome experience to see the dancing Dolphins in the seaüíßüíêüëç"
Just Dolphins ,This beach is the best place to be used to get boat to see the dolphin. Other than that nothing else. Even getting good food snacks is also difficult.
Not a nice beach,We thought this sounded worth a visit wot a disappointment it is a fishing cove the beach is littered with all sorts of nasties also a lot of dog pooh stayed about an hour YUK
Amazing,"So much to see, beautiful curios to choose. the sand though was so hot so I suggest closed shoes on a hot day. the sea shells are a beautiful sight too!"
Sadly changed,"Was in Goa with friends who had stayed at Coco beach many times and keen to show us where they spent many a good holiday, unfortunately the beach was almost destroyed by a Tsunami a couple of years ago. I can imagine how beautiful it must have been with palm lined beach and beach shacks but now a very busy fishing/ boat jetty taking fishermen out,you can take a boat trip from here but do your homework our trip was not the best geared more to locals rather than Europeans ( maybe use your tour company)"
Dolphins!,You might be disappointed as you enter the beach as the sand is all black here but once you are aboard the boat and away from the beach you will surely be delighted to see the dolphins playing in the water. And if you are not lucky enough to have a sighting of dolphins you can take heart from viewing the Aguada fort and the Millionaire's Bungalow.
A rubbish dump! Why would anyone go there!!,Shocking! We hired a scooter and decided to visit CoCo Beach - we were completely shocked at the amount of rubbish on the beach. We have never seen anything like it.  Not sure why anyone would want to visit this place.
Dolphin Attraction,"Coco beach is place to visit for dolphin watching. There is basic difference between seeing Dolphins in Dolphin show like what one can see at Singapore or at simmillar place and Dolphins swimming in sea. In Dolphin show they come fully out of water surface and dance or do other activity where as Dolphin come out of sea water partially when they are swimming in sea. Hence one has to be prepared for the same. After reaching beach there are facilities to keep shoes in shops. Then walk down in sea for a little as boats are inside sea water, away from shore. One has to climb in boat and for which operators help. Then wear safety jacket.Boat ride takes inside sea and few spots are shown such as bunglow of diamond merchant, Agwada jail, Light house etc. And then spotting of dolphins start. Once dolphins spotted, immediately all boats starts in that direction and one can see dolphins swimming in sea partially coming out. For children it could be good activity and for elders it could be good else just boat ride in open sea with cool breez. Water near beach is not that good also beach strip is narrow.Near to this beach there is beach spot where water sports activities happens such as Bananana ride, bumpy ride, parasailing, scooter etc. Those who can enjoy sport they can else sit, eat, drink, relax in shacks or at beach. Beach is very nice clean and sport activities are safe with care taking staff. All activities are highly recommended. Nice place ....."
Ya ya ya coco jumbo!!,"This beach is a little off location from all the other beaches that are upbeat and usually on route. It is a small beach wherein you will find a lot of shells. So, if you are a shell collector, you gonna love it. There's a small restaurant outside (from where the beach is not visible) that serves amazing feni."
Dissapointed,"We have been visiting this beack for over 8 years and every year we have noticed that it has become more and more commericalised.8 years ago, there was one hotel/resturant and that was it, the rest of the beach was covered in fishing boats and fishermen trawling in thier catch, seriously beautiful place to visit.This year, it was to much, the walk down to the beach was like walkinginto Anjuna market, shack after shack with people selling thier wears, there are now a number of food and drink shacks and the poor fishermen have been pushed to the far end of the beach.Sadly this will be the last year that we visit this beautiful place as the hawkers and commericalistion is just one step to far now."
Coco beach ,We used to visit Coco beach a lot of times before was a nice beach and very calm sea so Ideal for not so good swimmers  but when the tsunami hit it most of the beach got washed away so now it‚Äôs just for boat trips  and no proper beach there ...... so sad we used to stay  for a  few nights in the bungalows there  that we‚Äôre almost on the beach
INDIAN. The real India?,Good Indian food served in Indian style in a thali. The beach is not crowded. Did not bathe here. Plenty of colourful boats.
not good,beach not suitable for swimming too many tour and fishing boats  always very busy mostly for indian tourists
A less popular Beach worth visiting,"Coco Beach is hardly 2 Kms from Panjim. It is not a popular beach making it very clean and less crowded. Nearby the beach is the Reis Fagos fort which is an amazing fort built by the Portugese. If you are looking for some off beat places, this is a must visit one."
Pleasure,"can see dolphins. Different water activities can be done like water skiing, water gliding and scuba diving."
Dire,"Been here previously on a couple of occasions as a setting off point for dolphin watching. Neither trip was particularly successful as the dolphins were always at least 100m away and the boats just chased around after them. There were beach shacks loungers etc and a reasonable stretch of beach, part of it a working fisherman‚Äôs beach.Oh what a change, the fishing part is still there but what greets you where the shacks were is a jumble of stalls selling the same stuff which is available everywhere. There must be at least 30 dolphin chasing boats and many more touts. Stay away it‚Äôs disgusting not worth the effort"
Coco beach a boat pick up point,"We used to visit coco beach 10 years back and had not gone for so many years now. The coco beach used to be a small quite beach tucked away near main tourist attractions in goa. Alas , like all other places , it had to become commercial and crowded when tourism increased. But still the boat rides from here are worth time and money . For 300 rs per person almost an hour of boat ride to see dolphins and near by hill top buildings like old jail , it is pretty reasonable.and again there is not really huge crowd .As beach it self is tiny .And boat guys are polite and professional. So over all not a bad day to spend in goa at the beach . the small restaurant Rohan is on beach over looking sea and has beautiful view from there . And staff at Rohan is friendly and nice ."
Not what is used to be,"When we first went to Goa , nearly 20 years ago Coco Beach was a beautiful secluded beach Now I'm afraid it is ruined , the beach is covered in litter and oil"
Beach for Dolphin ride,"Coco beach is situated at the mouth of the Nerul River on the Mandovi Estuary, directly opposite Panaji. There are regular boat rides into the Mandovi river and most notably, into the bay, where tourists can engage in one of Coco's most popular attractions: wild dolphin spotting.This beach can be visited only for one purpse - Dolphins! The beach is quiet dirty and the water on the shore is not clean, so don't think of playing with water. Just take the tickets to the dolphin tour and hop in the boat. The Dolphin Spotting will cost you around Rs. 300 per head for 1 hr (which also includes some other attractions like Central Jail,  view of Aguada Fort Lighthouse et) Coming to the Dolphins ‚Äì there are pack of 4-5 dolphins and you have to be on constant look out to spot it. Once the Dolphins are spotted all boats rush towards it scaring it away. But worth the ride."
Dolphin site,"Coco beach is the place from where we went for the dolphin siting. the travel to the dolphin site was mesmerizing, we could see some dolphins in the deep sea but sad to see how we humans are slowly invading into the habitat and peace of these beautiful creatures with pollution ."
Dolphins not guaranteed!,"We took the dolphin boat ride from here. It was mid-afternoon, and though our guide tried quite long, we did not get to see any dolphins. The views and water are wonderful though. Recommend early mornings or after sundown - we were also told that the dolphins are more likely to be seen when the waters are not so crowded with boats."
Filthy place,"Coco beach is a very filthy & dirty beach. It's not the one like baga or candolim. Less population limited restaurant / shack options. Mainly tourist use this beach for travelling onward on boat . Here people will tell u that they will take u in sea & show u dolphins, but beware of fake promises sighting totally luck by chance thing. So avoid."
Rocky fishermen's cove,"This is a rare gem in north Goa, near the Candolim beach.Its part of a C shaped beach front....rocky in parts...where there are a lot of fishermen's boats.If one is lucky, one can see dolphins out at sea in the morning time. Lots species of Egrets and Herons about for bird watchers.The sunsets are picture perfect.Secluded and quiet, there are no nearby restaurants on this stretch of beach....ideal for a more serene Goa experience,  away from the usual party scene."
Nice Beach,Its one of the less explored beaches near the Fort Aguada area just before Candolim. Good scooty getaway from the hote in the afternoon.
Dirty Smelly Coco Beach,There is nothing worthwhile here. I don‚Äôt recommend it.There is a strong smell of oil from the boats. Definitely a no no
Nice family time,"It was a fun day outing. We saw few dolphins. There is a lot of street food available like bhel, chat and maggi, but I would advise you to carry some good snacks yourself. The place is crowded on weekends."
Nice beach,Coco beach is nice beach shells bahut adhik shankhya me milte h and boat me bhi dolfin dikhane me liye le jate h boating jarur karni chahiye this is most of attrection at this beach
Visit only if you with Kids and that too only once,"Nothing their to see, bad single way road which brings you to this place, dirty beach and really bad ( Black) water, they take you out for a boat ride and you get to see the fins at the most of dolphins 1/2 times if you lucky.Maybe kids can see it that too only once , spend your time and money else where, would be much better."
AMAZING BOAT RIDE,"Amazing boat ride, very frightening but also enjoyable. It was an experience. The person who was piloting the boat was very encouraging and assured that all will be well. Thank you"
Highly commercialized for Dolphin Boat Rides,"The place is connected by a thin road. The place has ample parking place but it gets blocked during high tourist traffics. The whole coastline is filled with food n drink shops. A number of ferry operators operate boat rides for dolphin sightings (sometimes it felt like dolphin harassment, with 10-15 boats running behind those creatures).The beach has nothing like beach, just a coastline. If you like open air fried fishes, then you will have a good time here."
Average Beach,This is Average place. But the in which we stayed overnight was far better instead of staying in hotel room.
Black sand beach,"The locals call this place the black sand beach, its quite dirty but truth be told, the food around here is very good"
Black sand .Difficult to reach.Starting point for boat rides .,"Coco beach at one time, used to be covered with shells and shells.Not anymore as I found during my recent visit.It was disappointing to see black sand and dirty waterproof .This is the commencing point for dolphin sightseeing and other boat rides. Reaching this beach is also difficult ,through narrow lanes .Other than that nothing much to do here ...it's better to visit the other nearby beaches."
Highly avoidable dirty beach,"This time around we decided to visit beaches other than the usual Candolim, Calangute and Baga in North Goa and Coco beach was one of them, It is a very small beach to be reached through narrow lanes between villages and through fields. The sand is black and sticky almost clayish. Nothing that you can do there except go a boat rides. Very dirty and small beach. Highly avoidable"
Very beautiful a place to forget the real world,A must go place for a night beach is fantastic good food friendy staff tents adequate. Dancers in the evening locals showed triditional goa dances not to miss
Beach is not that good,"I had gone with my family. Beach Sand is black colour. It is little dirty too.. it is good for those tourist who want to go for boat ride , dolphins rides and for grand island. I would suggest this beach  is from other beaches of Goa.. u cannot find more tourist in this beach. Less crowded."
Average beach for Dolphin spotting only,This beach is recommended only if you want to have a Boat ride or dolphin spotting as this is the starting point for boats if you want to see Dolphins as well as fort aguada from Sea side.Overall there are too many stalls and upkeep and cleanliness is lacking.Kids can collect sea shells from this beach
Too much oil,"Lovely beach, but too much oil in the water and no wind. Sheltered too much. Good good on beach though."
Spoilt,"We arrived on a boat trip which is part of the problems for the beach. The sea and sand are covered in oil pollution. The beach is dirty with glass on it, and rubbish.  There are several stallls with the normal hassle from them to buy there goods. On the boat trip your walked through the small beach to get to the eating area which means you are hassled Ali g the way. Not a nice place to vibist needs massive clean up"
verry safe swiming also fore children.,"plenty of shops at one end of the beach, the rest of the beach is taken up by fisherman neting,plenty of room for swimingthe beach is cleaned every day ,and some friendly dogs that like a bisket.while your thear you must visit dominiques shack (dely dolys},his wife and 3 girls are a loverly famerly.we have been going fore 20 years,"
It's not what it is,The beach is small and very dirty Pls be careful as there is broken glass and empty beer bottles around the beach and in the water. Wear appropriate footwear to protect yourself at all times even in the water.
Over night visit,"Cola beach is reached  by a long dirt track, takes about 15  minutes in a car.The Blue Lagoon resort is right at the edge of the ocean.Well worth the trek to get there.With cottage style chalets with stunning sea views.The idyllic beach is kept immaculate by beach cleaners."
Filthy,"We have to visit here to go on a dolphin experience and I can only describe it as the worst experience of my holiday. It was full of rubbish going down to the beach, the stench of rotten fish hanging in the air made me wretch and the sand was the dirtiest colour grey I‚Äôve seen. The whole pathway and the length of the beach was full of stalls, beach sellers and beggars.  it really is not somewhere I would recommend as a day trip. Stick to the other beaches in candolim or Calangute. This is not a beach to sunbathe on x"
Different but interesting!,"It was a short taxi ride from Candolim to the beach which has a back drop of coconut palms. It is a large curved bay with numerous fishing boats and trip boats to see the dolphins. Due to this event the water is not of the best quality and litter is present.There are shacks to eat at and obtain a cold drink, toilets are ife! Overall I found it interesting and it was a pleasure to watch the sea eagles soaring above and feeding from leftovers from the fisherman catch."
Just for boat rides,"The village is fantastic, but the beach is not that good. As mentioned by others, its only used for boat rides. We went for dolphin sightings from this beach. Will recommend this only for getting a boat ride to watch dolphins, other than that there is nothing to do here."
There is no beach !!,"Dirty, filthy place only used for boat trips don't expect to use as a beach. How times have changed this used to be a usable beach!!"
Super,"Lovely part of Goa, kept clean and tidy and very up market. Water very clean and no sellers bothering you."
Do not deserve such negative reviews,"This place was great. Rooms, comfort staff, pool. Did not regret booking it. We loved it. Wish I was still there."
Average,"Average beach, not a good place to relax, foodcourts are ok only, small market at the beach, water sports activities. But there are lot more better places for each of these activities."
Packed with tourist buses,This used to be a quiet beach but now packed with tourist buses and cars that come there for dolphin tours. Highly avoidable .
Charming.,"We happened upon Coco Beach by virtue of a boat tour ( Johns Tours ) where we stopped for a brief lunch at the restaurant.The beach appeared extremely safe and the food was delicious.Not five stars as the facilities were slightly limited, but for the area Coco Beach is a good alternative."
Nice and clean,Good Beach. Lots of shakes  and water sports around. Safe with family. all joints are reasonable priced. Its all fun there.
Exactly what imagine Goa to look like,"This was the starting point from our boat trip to the market, stunning little beach with lots of colourful boats"
Dolphin abode,Also known as home of Dolphins a must visit if u love boating ad nature it has a view of Fort the 70 minutes boat is fun the boatmen are keep to ensure u sight dolphins well we were luckyPlace lacks a neat loo so control ur bowels
Wonderful Experience,"The best place to watch Dolphins and kids will really enjoy it. If you are visiting Goa, don't miss it. Boat guy will charge Rs.300 per person (below 5 yrs is free) and total trip will take around 1 hour. They will also show you the old central jail and few bungalow's around."
"Best for Dolphin, Fishing, boat tours",This is a comparatively smaller beach . Main attraction here is dolphin and 4 other places tour by boat which costs Rs 300 per head.The trip is worth the money. You can actually spot the dolphin :)
"Good beach, relatively less crowded than peers","Good beach, relatively less crowded than peers. Clear water. you can see fishermen with their nets in the morning. Really nice place"
"Dirty Beach , Nice Dolphin spotting ride","The beach is blackish with very little sand. The dolphin spotting ride is nice , and also a nice view of Fort Aguada"
Only boat ride and dolphins,We started our day from here only. 300 /- ticket you have to buy. They will take you through boats to dolphin area. We saw dolphins multiple time here. its was great to see them in their home. Then the boat will go though you to different attractions. Its worth and value for Money. Beach doesn't have much to give.
Dark Graceful Water Beauties,"Dolphin Trip (Seasonal):¬†An exciting pleasure cruise where one can sight closely the frolicking dark graceful water beauties. Its a 40 - 45 minutes trip in sea. Must be visited by the travelers. But be careful, there is a restaurant adjacent to the ticket counter of Coco Beach boat ride.They are very rude in behave with tourists."
Very Beautiful Beach,"Enjoyed A most beautiful beach of Goa. Beautiful scenery,  not a beach you would go to spend the day sunbathing. The trip there is a lovely scenic journey, there are a couple of places to go to for food and drink. This wher you can hire a boat to go fishing. We enjoyed lot almost full day."
Wasted one full day here,"Horrible experience...felt like we went to some concentration jail as we can't go out as well. Whole day simply sitting there without doing anything. We can't call it as a beach. Its just some waste waster in a small shore with hundreds of people around. The local people over there are so horrible and if we see the way they prepare food, I don't think anybody can eat that...overall it was a horrible experience...."
Way different to other GOAN beaches.,"Ofcourse its a beach but not for beach lovers situated near Nerul (4 kms from Candolim, 2 kms from Reis Margos Fort.)A single road entrance to beach and its narrow between flora.Make sure road is clear before enter else you may be asked for Reverse Gear option.Only thing you can do over here is Boating. Pay Rs.300/head( 250/- also depending on rush),boat guy will take a round where you find Dolphins, Agoda Jail, Agoda Light house,sides of Agoda fort and a private bunglaw of a diamond merchant. Its worth visit for children. Almost 45 min ride. Few clothes shacks and food shacks( bread omlette, juices ) are also present."
Authentic place,"We went to Coco Beach to sail on a dolphin spotting boat. We had a great trip and saw 10 dolphins, surrounded by many other boats full of excited dolphin spotters.Afterwards we went for a walk on the bech which is very much a fishermen's working beach. We had a chat with two of them who were repairing their nets.We also had a drink and a bite to eat at the beachside restaurant which was visited by many Indian tourists on coach tours.We had a lovely time."
Beach not worth visiting.. except for Boat Ride to catch a view of Dolphins.,"Beach not worth visiting. except for Boat Ride to catch a view of Dolphins. For some reason, the water is very Blackish. However, the boat ride which shows couple of locations around that area is just OK. One can see Dolphins, if one is lucky. And we were. :)"
Hard to Find but Worth the Trouble ,"A lovely beach that‚Äôs quiet and tranquil, lovely shack food and the sea is like a mill pond. We have visited this beach a few times for time out from the normal hustle & bustle of some of the beaches in North Goa. Give it a go."
Once a Jewel of a place,"Unfortunately this beautiful beach suffered due to the after math effects of the Tsumani which happened a few years back (backlash of the Tsumani which hit Sri Lanka). It was such a beautiful beach much larger than it is now with approx 4/5 Beach shacks. The beach has been restored but lacks the feeling it had. It is still a smaller  pretty beach, safe waters for swimming, but not as well looked after. There are quite a few stalls on the way down to the beach. Also you will see the fishing boats land their catch of the day and moor up.There is 1 Restaurant on the entry to the beach area which has the monopoly. One needs a taxi or private car/scooter to get to this destination. The Entry from the Nerul side, just past Rita's Restaurant to the beach is One-Way. Please be careful/patient. Read the stretch of dirt track from the Nerul side to the Beach side. If clear you have the right of way. There is no room for 2 cars to pass so please don't even attempt it, as a tourist you will come off the worse. There are eating and drinking venues whilst on the beach but limited. If you come by taxi arrange for your taxi driver to return at a time suitable to yourself.There is plenty of Free Parking under the shade of the trees.The Beach is worth a visit. It is so peaceful"
The Coco beach,"The Coco beach is nothing to write about since it is hardly a beach. It is basically a starting point for the dolphin rides and the area where you see them is very close. People get to see them although being so close to the shore, you won't get a feel of the seas here."
Coco Beach,Coco beach is lovely too sunbathe on.  Go out on the boat too see the dolphins swimming near the boat.
Nothing to write home about,"Access is bad, road full of potholes and dirt. Dont trust about the tall claims of dolphin sightings as, sighting is very rare and locals are quiet rude. There are no restaurants near by neither there is any restroom facility, overall lots of garbage. The place is not frequentred by travelers and is deserted most of the time. Anti social activities are also reported at times. Better to miss it"
Beach famous for Dolphin viewr,Visited this place to go on a Dolphin watching tour. Beach is very small (& very dirty) and doesn't have many activities to do apart from Dolphin watching tour. I was fortunate enough to see several dolphins during my visit. Though the boats seem very risky. Would suggest them to have bigger boats for these tours.
Very ordinary beach,This is a very ordinary beach about 15 mins walk from our Hotel. I have surely seen much better beaches.
Terrible infrastructure,"Access is bad, road is broken, Dolphin sighting is very rare and locals are very aggressive and crude.There are no restaurants near by neither there is any restroom facility, overall lots of seashells and lot of garbage.Better to miss it"
hidden and beautiful,"this beach is a hidden beach, I think no one knows about this beach because you will see  hardly 2-3 families there.this beach is very beautiful, you will get dolphin rides from here, but I had never seen one, may be it was raining because of that.but a good beach if you are a couple"
Beach a hidden gem,"If you are in Goa and you are dolphin lovers.Then visiting this place is must, it gives an option to have a boat ride for a dolphin show.This is amazing , best time is 12 to 4 - chances are better to have a look at dolphin .Coco beach is the only place which an option of this boat ride , also they have two options motor boat personal and common - opt out common one that will be more comfortable."
Nice Beach,Loads of sea Shells are there on this beach. Nice Quite beach. No shacks available. Might be much cleaner during season time.
Dolphin Ride with no Dolphin's to see,"Beach is full of shells, no sand. I doubt it should be called a beach. It is a place from where once can catch Dolphin Boat Rides, although just keep in mind it will only be a boat ride, you won't get to see any Dolphin."
Boat ride without Dolphins ,"Just a break with a boat ride for about 35 minutes. As there are plenty of boats,  Dolphins sighting is far-fetched.  Rs. 300/- per head for 35 minutes is waste. The boat was not well maintained and even safety rule were flaunted by not insisting on visitors to wear life jackets."
avoid,"Coco beach is a small beach, quite dirty and the dolphin trip at Rs. 300 per person is not recommended, though we could spot very few dolphins but its not worth the time."
Coco beach,This is where they take you to see he dolphins and snorkelling and diving. Its quite pretty. If you get sea sick then don't go as the boar ride is almost 1.5 hours.
Not a must visit place!!,"1.  This a very small beach,no waves, water was quite dirty.2.  About 15-20 min drive from calagute beach3.  No water sports, dophin viewing is available but not recommeded.4.  Not many options to eat, very limited shops here.5.  No sunbeds"
Average experience for the dolphin trip,Average experience on the dolphin trip. Cleanliness of the area to get on to the boat was an area for improvement
Only for dolphins,Pros:Good for hiring dolphin viewing packagesBreezy areaGood for seashell collectorsA small market on the beachCons:Poor maintainence Dirty waterOver priced itemsNo water sportsA peculiar smell from the sand
Pretty grim,"Beautiful part of goa, surrounded by palms and the glittering sea, let down by huge amount of rubbish and debris both on the sands and water / not place to paddle barefoot and looked too filthy to swim - shame as the headland means the water is sheltered from the rolling waves. Usual collection of stalls selling tourist gear, and only one shack/restaurant open when i was there. The sand here is black as it is deposited by the river."
Poor Beach,"Probably the one of the worst beach of Goa. The place is known for base station for Boat trips Only nothing else.Small flee market along the beach, very dirty, single lane road access & smelly like fish house."
Place without proper maintenence,"This actually is a very good place as such but very much not looked after and hence not clean, the water being black rather than clear"
There are better beaches.,"If you want to go see Dolphins, this is the beach you would go to for the boats to see them. Other than that.. Not worth it."
Boat Trip to see Dolphins,"To see the Dolphins, its advised to reach there as early as possible. Tours start around 8:30 AM onwards, as that's when the Dolphins would be in abundance. If you go any later than 11 am, then you may not be able to see Dolphins and may not like the heat. Boats would be small and charge around INR 300 per person for a trip which is around 45 min to 1 hour. You'll be provided with safety life jackets. We could see some Dolphins and enjoyed the trip."
Calm but not too clean,"Calm waters but unfortunately the dolphin trips and fishermen have ruined this place which once used to have many beach shacks,only one remains now owned by Dominic and named after his daughters. Regulars still come as I said mainly because of the still waters ;perhaps one day someone will realize what they could actually achieve here and bring more tourist to the resort but at present the water is not that clean, the beach is not maintained to any standard"
Snorkeling Trip,After a snorkeling trip our boat driver took us here to have some food by the beach. Out of all the beaches I had been to in India this was the least looked after. There was rubbish everywhere and the water was almost black. However from what I understand this beach was hit by a tsunami and has not recovered since. This may be why it was in such a sad state.
Worst Decision....,"Going to Watch Dolphin With My Wife and 5 Years Son Was My Worst Decision Of The Goa Tour, Boat Having Capacity Of 10 Persons & Driver Takes The Boat Approximately 7-8 km Far Away In The Sea; Boat Moves Up Down Very Fast Which Was Very Scary and Unsafe For All Specially For Kids; We Saw Dolphin For Sake Of Name Only...."
Boat ride,"Not a good option to take small boats which have capacity of 10 odd people. Forget sighting of dolphins, the drivers take the boat bit far into sea n it starts swaying little strongly scaring hell out of those in the boat. No safety precautions followed by organizers. Pls take those big boats that can take 30-40 ppl which is stable and more enjoyable"
Castaway ,Beautiful beach and worth a trip we stayed overnight glamping and it was great the only downside was if you are not good at walking there are a lot of steps down to the beach
Lovely Beach,I loved the back massage on the beach. Lovely beach had fun. Water sports and boating trips are Organised here. Most of the beach shacks on Coco beach will offer you a boat trip round the bay. They will call this a 'Dolphin spotting trip'. There are a number of guest houses and restaurants located here. Its a ideal place for relaxation. Must visit.
waste of time ,I would not even call it a beach as it looked more like backwaters.We went there as it was just 5 minutes from Deltin Suit where we were staying.It was waste of time and energy.Better to head to Candolim Beach as its just 10 minutes away
Normal beach,"There are not too many visitors here, We went and came back in 1 hours, relaxing place for seniors and not for youngsters"
Guaranteed dolphins boat tours,"Great dolphin tours from this beach where we have seen triple, paired dolphins jumping (Not too high - but on surface of sea)"
Needs support,This beach used to be one of the best but since the tsunami it has wrecked the place but it's still a lovely beach with restaurants and stalls etc. Please go there and support the place
Don't go,Don't go its not worth it unless you need to tick your box as one of the places you have been to. There are a lot better beaches and less crowded.
overnight stay,"excellent - felt safe, it was clean and loved it very much will definatley return to this one, and every year"
Way to Dolphins,Nothing outstanding. But its the harbour for the ferries to take you to dolphins!!Do it for the checkbox.
dolphin watch,"Went to Coco Beach to go on a dolphin spotting trip. The trip was great, but the beach itself was filthy, lots of debris floating about in the sea"
Dolphins Spotting!!,"The Coco beach is at the mouth of the Nerul River on the Mandovi Estuary, which is opposite to Panaji. The main attraction of the beach is Dolphin tour, it's an almost one hour tour, wherein you get to see the dolphins and a few spots around like the central jail in goa, a very lavish mansion, which btw is very beautiful and a fort. It was fun although the dolphins are shy, we could spot them 4 or 5 times clearly. Had fun!!"
Dolphins!! ,"We visited this beach for the Dolphin ride and boating activity operated from here. This tour is almost an hour long. The places of attraction offered are the Governor's house,  the central Jain,  Dolphins."
Its on bank of Mandovi River,"Its not on Arabin Sea, it is situated in Mandovi River. Good for cheaper dolphin tour otherwise its a time waste"
Dolphin Tour was amazing !,"Dolphin tour at Baga will cost you around 3500-4000 per person while you can do the same here at 600 per person ! There is nothing else (like Shacks, Water sports) on the Beach except for some eatery, collectibles and cloth shops."
calm and peaceful,"Loved visiting this beach... calm and peaceful in early mornings... for the rest of the day, it gets quite crowded!"
Dolphin Trip,"A hustling bustling beach where you get your boat trip. Not a beach to linger or sunbathe. Plenty of stalls for water, sun hats and anything else they can turn a rupee on"
Visit for Dolphin,We took a boat ride to see dolphins in the see from Coco Beach. We were lucky to spot few dolphins in the see. the beach is more like a private beach. Paid 300 per person for the boat ride. Except the chance to see the dolphins swim the see no other thing was interesting in the Boat ride
Visit for Dolphin hunt,"Good Parking Space , could actually find some Dolphins can be more clean like to suggest a visit... lot of vendors around"
Good for shell collection and dolphin watching,Its a small beach where one can collect the sea shells and go in the waters in a boat to watch the dolphins. Morning hours are good time to spot the dolphins. Has small eating and curios stalls around.
More like a private beach,"Not many people know the way and the access to this place may not be great. So watchout if you are a first time traveler. Also, the currents are strong at this black sand beach. Not a great place for a swim."
Families and girls to avoid at all costs.,"We were in a group of 4 families (9 adults, 6 kids) and took package at INR 1500 per person suggested by Premiere Inn reception for snorkeling, lunch and dolphin watching including snacks and beverages. We were promised our own boat for 15 people but the boat  we got had 12 seats. When we asked , they said we have to adjust with the kids otherwise they can give a bigger boat but stags would be included. So we had to go for the smaller boat since the stags were drunk and looked menacing and leering  at the females.. Then the boat went about 6 kms inside the sea away from Vasco De Gama island and dropped anchor at a place where there were many boats full of young stags. The water there was dirty and snorkeling was a complete joke. You can see only dirt everywhere and visibility of the water was zero. Anyway we dived in the dirty waters in life jackets and swam sometime. Then it was time for lunch and the boat took us to a small beach overcrowded with drunk stags all leering and cat calling  at the unfortunate females who have landed there. Lunch was being prepared in aluminum foils and when announced there was a mad rush for queuing up. After requesting the organizers who looked like rowdies, they arranged for a separate queue for females. In the male section, the queue had 500+ people. This beach was damn dirty also. We did not even dare to see the wash rooms or changing rooms . We called our boatman early as we felt we have to leave the place at the earliest since the whole atmosphere was unhealthy. Next we went further into the seas for dolphin watching and this was the only positive experience in this so called package. We spotted few dolphins swimming and were lucky to see one doing a somersault."
Nice Food,I went in Rainy season not able to explore more in beach but had a nice food in a restaurant with sea view.
Must Visit Place,"Boat ride is great experience. Just go and enjoy the scenic beauty of Goa. Bungalow of a Diamond Merchant,"
Filthy,"Reached this beach via a boat trip to see dolphins, washroom facilities are very poor, and there is a small market in place, all adding to more rubbish on the beach. You certainly would not swim of the beach."
One more beach,"People matter and when you land with many of them together, it can just take away your pleasure. One such disappointing experience here. Anyways, a beach is a beach and Goa is Goa!"
Goa's rustic beach,"Located about 30 minutes‚Äô drive from the Panjim city center after crossing the Mandovi river & moving past by the river front near Nerul.  This is a common halt of local tour operators plying north Goa beaches. This picnic spot is a tiny beach front without any established public rest rooms but one can always buy some mineral water or soft drinks from the vendors & request to use their private toilet before going on to the boat ride to watch Dolphins & distant light house, British time jail (it is normally said that a petty crime is more than worth the deal to watch the sunset from the jail room), fort Aguada & rich diamond merchant‚Äôs iconic private bungalow from the boat.  There are many coconut trees & a short sandy stretch congested with outlets selling caps, clothing & sea shell trinkets.  It is better to carry some snacks with you if you plan to stay here a bit longer.  Also avoid wearing shoes because the boats stay put in water with periodic small waves & this can be an inconvenience during the boarding of it.  If too many tour operators come at the same time with busloads of tourists the entire place gets real crowded within no time."
Decent place for sighting dolphins,I never expected that I could see dolphins from that close. It was a good experience. Though the place could have been maintained properly. The place is really shabby. The boats are old and scary. You can give it a try once.
Dolphin trip,Dirty beach. Went for dolphin trip. Saw 4 5 dolphins from distance. Nice view of aguada fort from dolphin trip.
Worst Beach ever visited...,"One of the dirty beaches in Goa, also it has very limited strech and conjusted.. Not worth visiting,.."
No Beach left,"Went to Coco beach to board the boat for the Dolphin trip, as a beach do not bother, full of boats servicing the Dolphin trips and loads of market stalls"
Once a watch,Nothing much special about this beach. Not much clean too. U can hve a walk while passing by. Not recommended for a special visit.
Not a good bech,Compare to other beaches in goa this beach is nothing and doesn't have that much of attractions other than street side shopping and a boat cruise which i avoid.
very crowded,"it is very crowded beach , if you can then please avoid .  only the view is nice which you can get from any other beache ."
dirty,one visit put me off it was a lovely day had heard of coco beach so jump on my bike and off i go with great expectations what a let down got to be the dirtyest beach in northan goa
one night stay,"The beach is really beautiful, not commercial at all, we stayed in tents complete with en suite. A short walk along the beach fetches you to a lagoon, where there is beach huts(they look slightly posher than our tent!) All our meals were included and  villagers came in the evening and performed local dancing which was quite nice."
coco beach,"good day out, snorkelling was a bit crap, beach was ok, plenty to eat & drink, sea got up coming back got soaked, but had a good laugh, bit basic, but whats wrong with that, meet some nice people on trip."
Near candolim but avoidable,"The beach is very near to Candolim beach at nerul,but its a non commercial one.Its mainly a fisherman's village no shacks on the beach only a couple of small restaurants.Still ok for an hours visit.You can merge it with Regi magos fort."
Smelly black sand strewn with rubbish,"Go here to take a boat trip, there are many boat trips available from here. The beach itself is awful. It must have been nice at one time, the palms sway and the sea is beautiful but we didn't stay long."
atmosphere is very nice,the atmosphere is good at all to walk through the beach and i found this beach as best ever beach in india.the rush of the foreigner is also very much
Lovely clean beach,We really liked the beach and the sea is perfect for wading and cooling down. Lifeguards on duty. Strong currents so no much swimming.
"Nice Beach, Rare Dolphin sightings","Its a very small beach, but famous for boats which take you to supposedly dolphin watching. Dolphins are not clearly visible or distinguishable from the blue sea. Forget clicking picture of dolphins or with dolphins."
nice beach,"beach with full of coconut trees, u can enjoy this beach in mid hot afternoon, nice palce roam. good food nearby"
No Dolphin Sightings,If you are lucky...you may spot dolphins..very early morning...but rest of the day there is bleak chance of spoting one.
A safe and almost tideless flow beach,"This beach is shared by villagers and fishermen alike and is very popular for boat trips to see the dolphins in the Mandovi River estuary.....lots of Indian tourists visit this beach which has limited facilities,toilets and shacks.  The beach is very limited due to erosion at high tide but when the tide goes out its quite big.  Its very shallow up to 400 yards from the shoreline and no tidal flow means it is safe for kids and non-swimmers alike.Some days netters come down and walk out into the water and haul in what they have netted, which is fun to see and also to be able to see the fish they catch.It can be difficult to get to as the access road only allows one way travel......so be aware.............."
Most Dirty & Black Beach. Often used for Passage to Dolphin view,It is most dirtest beach over the beaches i visited in goa. This beach is used as a deck for boats to Dolphin View. It has black sand & often found dead fishes lying all over the beach. I would not recommend this beach in Goa.
Only beach for scuba diving,Beach is famous for scuba diving. A long 1 hour journey needed for experiencing scuba diving. Spent an entire day with other guys for a perfect scuba experience. Beers are provided while returning and also a decent meal was  provided in the package. Not so much special other than scuba and snockling
Amazing Boat Ride ,"I took a 1 hour boat ride from coco beach and it turned out to an unforgettable experience.After taking off from the beach the boat cruised along the serene Arabian sea and we got to see the Aguada Fort, Aguada Lighthouse, Central Jail, a Millionaire's Bunglow and Dolphins !!The beach itself is filthy and dirty but the boat ride is worth it."
Not worth to travel,"WE been there for dolphin,, we were lucky enough to spot dolphin  but the beach is really dirty.. i will not recommend any one to travel..."
beach off track and quiet,a quiet beach which can be used as a picnic spot for families and boats also leave here for dolphin sightings though we could not see much of them.
Good quite beach,Nice beach....cool breeze ...quite beautiful place to visit with family...less crowded as compared to calungate beach.
Bitter Sweet Moment,"Its just cruel to see 15 jetty's surround a dolphin just so it comes out..The boat trip was pleasant, but what the boat operators do is just savage."
An average beach,"The coco beach is just a narrow strip of sand, to mention it as a beach is an exaggeration. It is also quite dirty and over congested with hawkers selling their knick-knack. There are some dolphin rides available from the numerous ferries located at this area. Overall it is a place that you can easily give a miss."
Good,"It was really good experience, the beach was clean and not so much crowded, the overall experience was good."
Quite a dirty beach due to the Monsoon conditions,Very disappointed with the beach facilities - there were none unfortunately - such a shame.  We were there in the middle of September so hardly 'out of season'.
‚ÄúDolphin Dolphin ride at Coco Beach‚Äù,"We took a boat from this beach to watch dolphins at a distance. The boat took us through Fort Aguada, and Aguada Jail. We could catch a glimpse of dolphins"
Coco beacch,It's a lovely quite beach we always go to India every year got to say we always visit coco beach and worth a visit.
peaceful,although it is very peaceful and beautiful beach but not much happening as calangute beach which is just 4-5 kms away..
Beautiful Beach,such a beautiful beach as they all are in Goa and to experience the blue waters and the wonderful sunshine as well as the locals is pure bliss :-)
Ok ok,Not a great beach. A little far off. Good if you have a hotel stay nearby. Water quality is good though.
Great View,Great experience to travel in the boat. Dolphin show was exciting as we were just few steps away from it.
Dolphins Point In Goa,While visiting a sea shore most of the times we reminds dolphins the most beautiful and mindful creator under water and you can also find them in Goa. Coco beach has drives to show you dolphins sight seeing. must see view and nice ride in the water
Good beach for a dolphin ride...,"Coco beach as the name suggests has a lot of Coco plantations on and around the beach. It is a boating beach and not a bathing beach. From here one can take boat rides (regulated) or private and they will start looking for dolphins. As soon as any one of them finds a dolphin, they will speed up to show it to you and the other boatmen will follow the same. Fort Aguada is visible from the sea from here. It offers a nice view of the island and one can be lucky if finds proper views of dolphins. It appears that due to too many boat and visitors the dolphins shy away."
Dolphin cruise off Coco Beach,Coco beach is pretty but crowded.  Went on a dolphin cruise and got a fleeting glimpse of a dolphin. There is no jetty - getting on requires you to walk into the sea.  Boat was okay but the operator asked two of us to sit on plastic stools - not a great experience. Also did not ask us to  put on life vests which were dumped on the floor and of poor quality.There are better cruises at other places.
Nice Beach,The beach is remote and isolated. The place is very nice. Beautiful Beach. There are very less shops and eatery. Cool waters.
Dirtiest beach in goa,Please avoid. Dirtiest beach. And the dolphin tour is a sham... if you r lycky tou will see a dolphin or too who are also very shy due to very heavy boat activity.
perfect place for day out,coco beach is perfect place for day picnic best part is the 30 min boating tour the views are amazing and in all a good and different experience must go place
Sea paradise,Nice beach. Good for dolphin sighting. You can board boats and see an old palace and prison near the beach.
Wonderful Beach,This is among one of the most wonderful beaches of Goa. We spend most our time on this beach and enjoyed it the most
Nice small beach in North Goa,This is a nice small beach in North Goa. The road leading to the beach is a bit confusing. The last stretch of road towards the beach is a narrow passage. There are many local operators who conduct dolphin safari from here which is similar to the one conducted from close to Fort Agauda.
"Beach wise, domestic tourists would like it.","The sand was not nice,not the place to chill on the beach,its mostly domestic tourists and vendors flogging tourist junk.Domestic  tourists are packaged in by tourist boats.A couple of beach shacks with good views may make it bearable for laid back international tourists."
It's okay,"Coco beach is nothing great - when you're in North Goa, the beach options you have as a tourist are plenty, and I found all of them better than this beach. For starters, this isn't a sandy beach - so bye, bye sand castles. If you're into boat rides and not-getting-wet on the beach, you might like this place. But if you like the likes of Calengute and Baga, this is not worth the effort."
Dolphin Tours,We visited the beach just for Dolphin Tour that originates from here. There are some shops on the beach and the place is not really clean. The Dolphin Tour was interesting in the sense that they did their best to get Dolphin sighting but unfortunately we could just get a small glimpse.
Average Beach,This is an average beach but if you visit this beach in early morning then you can see lots of dolphins there. Locals told us that this beach was destroyed in Tsunami. Approach to this beach is quite good
peaceful beach,"nice beach but not clean beach like anjuna beach but very nice you can spend good 2 to 3 hrs , lots of activity happen in this beach like dolphin trip etc."
Lovely little beach,Went here a few days during our stay in Goa.There is a few sun beds but you have to get drinks there.We ate there a couple of times and the food is lovely.Nice and peaceful.
Coco Beach for Dolphins,"As a family with 2 kids, all of us were very eager to visit coco beach and go for a dolphin view ride. The ride was good, seen some good landmarks on the way. travelling on a small boat against some strong tides was a thrill. Being afternoon, firstly we were disappointed to not seeing any dolphin, but that vanished into pleasure of joy when we were back near the beach and spotted the spectacular dolphins. Reach early - around 8-10 am if you want better spotting."
Got to watch some dolphins on the dolphin boat ride,"Frankly i did not expect, we will see any dolphins. But I was really surprised to find some. The boatman ensured that he took us to the area where dolphins were spotted and we got some good view of them."
Dolphin Beach,This is a place from where you get boat ride into the sea for a trip around and see dolphins in natural habitat.
Fishermans Beach used for dolphin rides,"Coco Beach is use for the sole purpose of Dolphin rides. Its dirty very very bad in condition. You will find a lot of shops selling soft drinks, Icecream, Hats Etc."
A bit run down,"The trip,out to Coco Beach on our hired scooter was lovely. We rode along quiet country roads by the river to arrive at Coco Beach full,of anticipation. We were sorely disappointed. It is a run down area, poor quality beach by Goan standards and full,of sellers."
"Difficult access, less cared for beach","Well visit this beach to catch one of the Dolphin tours. This beach was quite difficult to access one has to cross the nerul river brigde and then go through narrow village road to reach this beach. Another issue being a lack of proper parking. And well the beach was not at all developed, with just a few vendors on it and a lot of boats. It was also not very clean. Anyway the beach is not so good for swimming as well."
Island trip,"island trips on coco beach is good with dolphin, sightseeing ,snorkeling, fishhing,and adventure activities"
One of the Great beach of GOA,"Advised u if you are going to goa then also visit this beach.This is a estuary beach, A few shacks north of the beach south side fishing bouts lined along the beach with the smell of dead fish and discarded sea snakes when we were thier some were still alive.Not very clean, not a place to lie out in the sun, you can spend a nice 4/5 hours before you get bored.We did meet and talk to some people who love it and stayed most of thier time on this beach.To be fair it was Hassle free and Quieter than most, with a long walk down to the beach"
"Nice Beach, worth one time visit.",Starting point for the Dolphin Tour. Good Nice clean beach but not recommended for swimming. Nice scenatic coconut trees at this beach. The way to this beach is so awesome. We paid approx INR 600 for the Dolphin Tour .
Chaos,I read the other reviews and I'm not sure what beach they were on. The beach entrance is crowded with stalls and vendors calling to you as soon as you get out of the car. The stalls on the beach with clothes and other typical souvenirs go all the way to the water line. No literally! Then the boats start with their sales pitches to show you the Dolphins! There is no quiet spot that I could see or find. I left in about ten minutes. It was chaos. There was a little opening beyond where I stood but it was a small area not worth all of the chaos.
Beautiful and peaceful,"Great beach, stayed over night and was so relaxed. Be mindful of the descent down to the beach it's quite a hike and not at all suitable for anyone with walking difficulties. Would recommend two nights or more and book independently, as the tours only give you a short time here"
what a quiet beach,"vs the hustle and madness in baga and anjuna, coco beach is yet not very crowded and the water is calm, so was great"
Nice beach scene,Went to this beach for lunch after a boat trip had a great lunch fish etc. The beach was ok not good for swimming due to sll the boats so lots of diesel in sea. Loved watching fishermen dragging their fishing nets in and the dogs scaring off the kites birds to stop them stealing the fish! amazing to watch them
Dirty Beach!,"We chanced upon this beach as a part of our boat tour. The beach was dirty, lined up with filthy boats and shabby stalls. Even the tourists did their bit to maintain unhygienic status of the beach. Definitely avoid going here."
fishing beach,this is not a realy beach... this is used for fishing or island trips. dolphin trip starts from here.. bt u get fresh fish here
Dirty,Dirty beach. We went for dolphin trip from this beach which was very good. We had nice trip with lots of dolphins and it was fun
Not so good beach,"Went here for the day but was disappointed,not much here and not very clean,a few stalls selling stuff and a few eating places,Winn stick to Candolim !!!!!!"
Thrilling experience,"Once you go there, will fall in love with this beach.Surroundings are lovely as shacks loaded with good drinks,food and relaxation set up, even boating facility is also available."
Too much made of it,"This beach is nothing like the photos you will see.  It is not as clean as other beaches nearby, and nothing special. Found it to be littered and not as clean as other beaches around it."
Dolphine Sighting,Really great trip. I saw Dolphines less than 50 meters away. Never seen Dolphines in natural habitat free which was great experience.
Great evening,Good water sports and shack options. ... Relatively clean beach ....  Shacks a little over priced and do not really care for business. They really lack in good customer service.
Coco Beach - Dolphin viewing --- average experience,"We went to the Coco beach for the much hyped dolphin viewing and boat ride around Fort Aguada. We paid approx. 300 INR per person for a 1-1.5 hour ride. The boat ride around Fort Aguada was pleasant, but I felt sad when I actually saw the way dolphin spotting is conducted. Approx. 7 to 8 boats were circling the area where dolphins are spotted by chance. Poor creatures come up only for 3-4 seconds and then vanish beneath. Clearly - not an ideal way to spot dolphins.. that too not happy ones either, with all the motor boat sound and crowd howls around."
Good one day fun activity,We took a trip plan from the coco trips... It was a one day activity... The trip will provide you pick up and drop service from/to hotel.. after that for 1 or more than 1 hrs they will take you in a boat till island where you can do snorkelling... here they will show you dolphins as well.... once the activity is done they will provide you food and beverages and take you return...
Good for dolphin ride,"This is for dolphin ride.There is a 45 minutes boat service which helps in excursion of fort agauda , millionaire bunglow which is very amazing and must watch destination.Cellular jail which is a heritage site can also be seen during this boating excursion .Dolphins are too good to watch.Prefer going early and you will definately spot a group of dolphin acrobats :) Worth visiting and affordable tickets for only rs 400- ample parking space available."
Swimming safe here.,"If you are afraid of swimming in the sea, try Coco Beach. It's safe for everyone wanting to dip in the sea."
Truly amazing.... ,We had a Grande Island exploring tour on boat for all the day at least and best price with high enjoyment. This was the bech in which we halted for having lunch....
Only for dolphin ride and nothing.....,This beach is only for dolphin ride and Jhon's boat tour. During dolphin ride one can see the fort aguada from see which looks beautiful. Beach is not clean in fact very dirty and no beach sunbed.One can easily see dolphins from boat in middle of the  see.
Dolphins and curry,"Had a morning dolphin watching just off the beach, followed by a very nice lunch on the beach. Very good excursion."
Calming Coco,"Still a lovely little bolt hold of a beach after the effects of the 2004 Tsunami, calm waters for the not so confident swimmer."
like the  sea food,"good  service , sea  food  was   good  , other varieties  of  food  can be  improve . We  enjoyed  as  the family  and  certainly like  to recommend  to  others."
Dolphin trip,"I tried the dolphin and Aguada trip with my family. Ask you driver to take you the ticket counter. The boat ride is for 45 mins to 1 hour. There are four or five boats which travel together and shout to one another when there is a sighting. Dolphins popped up from the sea - but never close to the boat. After spending a whole lot of footage , I managed to catch the dark grey coloured dolphin back in my camcorder! The kids were excited. The boat ride also takes you near the Aguada Jail and the fort. Good photo op.I would suggest that you visit the Fort Aguada and then come to Coco Beach.My driver mentioned that dolphins come up to the surface in the afternoon and I tried the ride around noon."
Not worth the effort,difficult to get to and pretty pointless. Approach is kind of tricky and is definitely not worth the effort.
beautiful little beach,"This is a beautiful little beach on the banks of the River Mandovi.The waves are mild, good for swim. Lots of eating places, but you need to look out for a good one; not all are good. nice place to spend the day and relax."
coco,if you want to relax in Goa u should try this beach a simple and pleasant beach... just sit and relax
Nothing to see on Coco beach,"Before THE tsunami was coco beach a really beach, were you cold stay and swim.You had beach  shacks , but now there is nothing left , then only boats who are taking indians for a boattrip.There is still one restaurant with less food and father Total nothing.So nothing worth to visit"
Washed away,"Have spent many happy times on coco beach in the past but most of it got washed away a few years ago,still a quiet place to visit."
travelling by boat to the markets,Not so much a beach anymore but interesting river side location - good to see different aspect to Goa
very good,we reach coco beach which is not that great but still worth spending some time. Overall good experience
Good experience. But may cause sea sickness,"The dolphin tour was a good experience. We went by John's Boat Tours. The boats start around 9 am every morning. And the first few moments are simply superb as we sail from the back waters to the main sea. Don't forget to carry your zoom camera. The one draw back is, people may get sea sick as it is is a 4 hr travel. Once it is over, we reach coco beach which is not that great but still worth spending some time. Overall good experience."
very good,excellent place for dolphin ride. rides offer a good view of jail and a mansion of a smuggler. good overall
Dolphin Ahoy,This beach is used for launching the dolphin sighting cruises. The boatmen were courteous and made it a point to show us Dolphins and other sightseeing point all along
not as good,Just back from my holiday to lndia.my wife and l went to coco beach for a meal.As everyone knows this beach was washed away a few years ago.It is still not as good but after a boat ride to see the dolphins we were taken their for meal.
"Not a good beach, pollution and crowded","Very dark sand from pollution.lots of boats in area.a handful of trinket stalls selling souvenirs.a few places to eat, not that any seem very good.mainly used by day trips and excursion company's for a stop off to eat."
Dolphin Trip,"Beach on the whole was shabby and untidy , but the dolphin ride from coco beach was invigorating.Managed to see a few of them, not like we see in a dolphin show, but a bit when they swim across.Actually surprised to see them so near the shore. Quite a few boats close on them, making it difficult for all to see. One needs to be constantly glued or in a flash its gone.The boat ride was good .took us around and saw a few sites from the sea"
It's an average place to visit .,This place is used for boating .Dolphin point is the main attraction but there is no dolphin but some nice view of palm tree and one billionaire home
Not Maintained,This beach is famous for the Dolphin spotting tour's that start from here. The beach is not really maintained well and needs lot of cleaning.
Untidy,Not a wow place if you are in Goa. Certainly people only come here to see dolphins and you get boat ride. I would prefer to be near another beach to enjoy better experience
Decent Beach,This is definitely not one of the best beaches of Goa. There are much better beaches to visit. There are lots of boat rides available at this beach.
dolphin safari beach,I visit this place in november 2015. dolphin safari(Rs.300) is a new experience. you can actually spot dolphin during this ride. make sure you carry your glasses/goggles. or you can purchase it from local vendor(Rs.100).  Girl can flaunt with tiara(rs.30-40 bargain).
Enjoy boat rides and have a look at Dolfins,"Great place to have a beautiful boat ride across the river and enjoy the Dolphin view, Outside view of Goa central jail and Fort Augada is also seen."
Black and Dirty water,Black and Dirty water  which could cause Skin diseases if stepped in to water. The boat ride is a joke and the money spent will be in vain as there are very few Dolphins to see and The monuments it offers to see is just a far away glimpse.
disaoppointment,the famed coco beach of yore is no more....the tsunami has robbed it of its charm & beauty.....it is only a rocky ghost of its previous silvery beauty
coco beach yeah!!1,Coco beach was the nearest to our Hotel in Candolim and the most cleaniest of all beaches we saw. We had amazing experience there
stunningly beautiful place,Went to Coco beach as part of a boat trip with a party of six way back in 2011 (only just got around to writing a review! lol) As part of the tour we went along the beautiful Goan coast taking in all India had to offer before arriving at Coco beach. Myself and others jumped overboard to cool off in the warm sea before enjoying a BBQ on the beach Goan style.
Starting point of the Island trip...Good beach..,This beach was the starting point of our Island Trip to Grand Island..it was a good beach we sat in a boat and the boat started on its journey in the huge waves...it was highly adventurous and scary for a bit..otherwise the beach was a very small one and had families staying right there on the beach which we had to cross to reach our destination for the boat ride..On our way back we also saw dolphins near the beach which an absolute delight to watch..they were playing and having a good time..
Nice Beach,Good to visit during morning time . Famous for dolphin trips and Grand Island trips from North Goa and many other water sports activities. white sand beach with lots of boats and coconut trees.
Watching Dolphins dive was a showstealer!,"Very beautiful beach...and gives you a chance to go mid sea and have a tour of the dolphins! We took a common boat and were excited to the mammals of the sea... I think there could have been a better facility to book diff. kind of boats. There is not much of info on that, but the one we did was also good and there was good navigation on what is on your left or right."
Coco Beach- A good adventure boat ride,"one who is travelling to goa, should always go for this ride,  never take small motor boat ride, always take this coco beach boat ride, this will make you see all historical places like jimmy bunglow, cenral jail, and dolphin, you should always take a boat ride at 11 or 12 then 99% you will b able to see dolphin, i have travelled this october and the experince was amazing. coco beach- tasty cocnut water, wonderful boat ride, -lovely place lovely ride."
Average fun place,"Nice place, had a good time here with my friends, the air was just fresh and the sun was good, however, I dint like how overcrowded it was and the management didn't care"
Used to be better,"This beach used to be better, now it  is a much avoidable place. The beach is rocky, the sands dirty and nothing much to do."
coco beach,"A nice day out. Either take a taxi or get a boat trip across. Thankfully we are quite active so we went by foot and walked. The distance is manageable it is the heat which tires you, so take plenty of water"
just relax,"Very nice place, it is close to beach relax your stay. Service is very nice, they offer bikes on rent too."
not bad,"this particular beach is totally avoidable, there are far beautiful beaches in goa where one can relax and spend some great time, so stop wasting time here."
Dont go here.. Water is dirty and beach sands are black,Dont go here.. Water is dirty and beach sands are black. I Spent just 5 mins here and took back the vehicle
Lush Green water,"too green and lovely view to be at COCO, awesome time we spent there, wish to go again and again...coming soon"
silent beach,"the beach with dolphine, the pople on this beach are less , so you can enjoy the peace of mind.love to be at the same beach again"
Trip to Island and Snorkling are available,"From Coco Beach you find daily visits to Island trip and snorkling is available. This is unique from the all the beaches, the location and water will be awesome."
Badly maintained,This beach is usually touted as a dolphin watch spot. There's garbage everywhere and poor maintenance. Access is also a little difficult
good place to visit,good and safe beach clean and tidy we went there on a boat trip and to see the dolphins good food also on the beach
Dont waste your money,"Its not private, sea too rough to go in, river/pond/lake full of elegyunhappy entertainers, red ants that bit everywhere, tell you best nights sleep in goa? I think if you slept on the beach it would be a lot comfier, beds very hard, kept banging our legs on corner of bed as the wood sticks out way too far ."
Awesome place to have fun,"One the best beach in Goa, Can have fun ultimately with your loved ones. I had been here for 3 times fully enjoyed at the most when ever I visit. If you wanna see the best of Goa you should obviously visit this beach."
Nice beach!,"The beach is very nice, even tough water is not very clean. I think it's something common in the area since water in other beaches was not more clean than here!"
private beach,towards the extreme north after calangute beach is the coco ebach is famous for having private parties.
Average,Not a very lively beach during the monsoon season which is when i visited it. Beach is located deep inside and is beautiful.
Paradise,"Beautiful beach so tranquil  it's like a castaway island with a fresh water lagoon,my advice take a good book and loose yourself or find yourself.The moon at night with the stars are just as stunning as the sunset.i've never felt so relaxed and stressed free.A very beautiful place indeed."
A sight to behold,We found it to be different from other beaches ....quiet and peaceful .......no noisy crowds.  Picturesque amidst a beautiful setting .....paddy fields alongside tall coconut palms swaying in the beautiful breeze.
Cool & Quiet Beach,Cool & Quiet Beach - to stay away from crowdy beach and to have a nice sunbath. You are thrilled. You will surely have fun. This is a must place for families who visit Goa. Lovely place for taking a nature look.
Dolphin show,dont miss the Dolphins at Coco beach. even the boat ride is extremly adventurous. the boat just sails over the big waves.... its so much fun. we did get to see dolphins as well. Also the boatman was kind enough to roam us around for 1.30 mins untill all very satisfied with ride and dolphines.
excellent,It was a quiet beach and beautiful.We thoroughly relaxed which completely helped to manage our stress .
Lovely place,You are thrilled. You will surely have fun. This is a must place for families who visit Goa. Lovely place for taking a nature look. There are no hawkers who trouble you.
Nice Place,"Monopoly of Boat Operators, apart of this our family have enjoyed a lot during travel, you get good quality food at candolom, calengute and Waga"
Coco Loco,Nice quiet beach away from the bustle of Candolim/ Calangute.A bit awkward to get there and the sand sometimes suffers from being in the estuary and can be dark. Good shacks with good food
tranquility,"very peaceful, lovely view.  tent was very clean and roomyown loo and shower. very welcoming staff food very nice. for me personally one day/evening was enough, but my friend could have stayed longer. evening entertainment of local dancers was really nice"
DOLPHIN TRIP,During our holidays we decided for the famous dolphin trip on the second day. We went to Coco Beach in order to take the boat for the trip. The dolphin trip was awesome and apart from that nothing special about coco beach
Quite dirty,The beach is quite small and dirty. It is used for the Dolphin rides by the boat companies. There are stalls to buy hats and other accessories.
Coco beach,"Was once one of my favourite beaches but since sunami has never recovered beach to all intents no longer exists ,maybe one shack of poor quality,and the water polluted with diesel oil,the smell of which hangs in the air making it unpleasant"
small but clean beach,on your way to the dolphin ride you can see it not need to go there in specific as it is a small beach not much happening.
Little to marvel about,"This beach used to be beautiful back in 2003 but has got smaller and more eroded over the years. There's almost nothing left of the sand, and the sea is extremely shallow (think Camber Sands water depths for those familiar with it, but without the big stretches of sand!). There are so many other lovely beaches in Goa that I'd give this a miss."
beach is a beach nothing else to it,good beach - its less crowded compared to the other goa beaches. ventrally located and easy accesss.
A little slice if Heaven!,"A private beach with tents to sleep in (with running water, toilet and shower!) Your our bar & barman with a super show put on at night by the local village ladies. Just sit and relax in your own little world. If you are staying in the north of Goa take a taxi (¬£30) as the bus is back breaking!, but its worth the trip. Enjoy"
Not much happens on this beach,We reached the beach at 6:00 PM and the beach was closed already. I was very disappointed as its not easy to locate the beach and read leading to it can fit only one car at a time.
Not so clean,"Nothing much to do other than a boat ride. They will show you some dolphins, Goa jail, diamond merchant's 80 crores bungalow, Vijay Mallya's personal cruise, etc.We had been to this place as a part of the North Goa tour by GTDC."
Quaint and relaxing!!!!!,"Quaint and relaxing!!!!! Avoid visits on long weekends!!! A touristy place, some lovely villas along the shoreline. Do bargain with the locals for better deals on the beach activites!!!!"
"Not a lot there but different, had our lunch there.","Did the dolphin trip sailed round the prison and Mr Kingfisher s home, then to Coco beach for lunch nice trip !"
Decent beach,Its a very nice place to visit and spending few hours on the beach but water sports you can see very rarely over there which i was expecting too much.
slient beach,"Like the salient and atmosphere, you can see more trees in that place. We enjoined and recommended to go and visit"
Calm,We could not visit the place...but we seen it during our boat trip. The beach looks calm & beautiful
Do not visit,This beach is the worst among all I saw in North Goa. Reason being it is the halt point for all the boat tours and the sand and water here have literally turned black. The sea shore/beach are almost non-existent. The tour guy told us that the shore got washed away during Tsunami(not sure how true is that).
Not good,Not good unless going for boat trip from here which may be cheaper than other areas. Good yo travel on this route if you want to see fields and village on the way.
Quiet Beach,This is very silent beach with hardly any waves. Many picnic groups come to Coco Beach. There are few restaurants too. Can have nice swim or boat ride . Only access road is very narrow permitting one vehicle at a time.But surely worth visiting
Just for dolphins...,The Beach is just 5 kms from the clematis. Deserted and calm. Best place to see dolphins... The beach is not so clean but people are friendly enough to help.
dolphin treasure,"loved the sight of dolphins, though it do took us 3 hours to sight them, worth going specially in early mornings"
nice beach,this Beach we stayed for more than an hour on our way back from dolphin ride for lunch...clean and nice beach it is with quietness...
Unexplored,Coco beach is an area where don't much tourist go. I like the natural beauty of this place the big big coconut trees and also the way of going to this beach is awesome. Clean water all round this place. Calm & cool place to relax.
Vergine beach of Goa,"Beautiful beach in North Goa, after Nerul. Roads are very narrow but the place is very scenic and lots of water sports are taking place"
nice place to go to,"it is nice beach 15 minute drive from Candolim, it is a small beach, not too crowded as large buses cannot go there nice restaurants around the place"
Little Bay,Lovely little bay with a beach. We went on a boat trip having seen dolphins and it was small but nice.
Only good for dolphin sighting,This beach is very crowded and commercial. However you get the best rates for Dolphin sighting than any other beaches.
Water sports,This is a good and quite beach its good for water sports.... its bot to crowded like the baga or calangute beach... very close to the market..
Good Location,"Lovely walk on beach and Pier. Pier being repaired, it had been in a poor condition. Tiki Bar relaxing and lots of fishermen (and women) hoping for a catch. Plenty of bird life and surfers to watch. Visibility for miles up to Cape Canaveral."
Must Visit for Dolfin Trip,Visit this beach for Dolfin trip. You can also see the historic jail and light house from the boat trip.
Newcastle  UK November-December 2014,what an experience.  beautiful beautiful beautiful.  Sleeping in a tent on a secluded beach is a wonderful way to live
Blue lagoon,Very unspoilt area with a long walk down to the beach but an uphill walk back to the taxi . Glad we didn't book to stay in the tents and huts for a night as it might have got a bit boring but a lovely day spent here
Dolphin site & plenty Coconut Tress,"Mainly this beach is for dolphin site and beach is surrounded by plenty of coconut trees which is known as and famous beach namely as coco beach.boat personals charge Rs.300/- per person & take deep into sea and assure us that without viewing dolphin he will never return us back,Personals in Goa are so helpful including police personals that without loosing temper they reply.Petrol is so cheap at approx Rs.55/- other states government should learn from Goa Government about making cheap transportation to attract tourist."
Dolphin Sighting,More than a beach its a dolphin ride place. The place is narrow and crowded. Didnt like it much. You can take a boat ride in the sea. Dolphin can be seen playing in the water.
