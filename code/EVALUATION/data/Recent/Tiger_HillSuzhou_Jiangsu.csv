History and nature come together.,"An excellent activity to spend a few hours on. Best to pre purchase tickets online. If driving to this attraction, there is a parking lot at the wedding ""town""- a large collection of wedding shops - about 10 min walk from the main gates. On a holiday afternoon there were no line ups. By China's standards, the venue wasn't crowded at all. The entire park is well preserved and clean. There is some signage in English, enough to give you an idea of what you are looking at. The most efficient way is to walk up the center to the pagoda from the south entrance and come down in the east side through the Great Buddha Hall, Crane Gully, a pot planted garden and a few other pavilions. Alternatively, can walk all the way through to the north gates, and if you drove and need to get back to the car at the south gate, just take a short boat ride on the canal surrounding the Hill. Overall, spent a very pleasant afternoon there without feeling crowded, unlike the experience we had in some of the classical gardens earlier that day."
Peaceful place ,"Great place to visit lovely and quiet ,reasonable priced and plenty places to eat and drink Very clean toilet facilities was also a bonus The history of area is fantastic reading ."
Beautiful grounds and gardens .... Leaning Cloud Rock Pagoda,The tiger hill is 36 meters high and it's other name is Surging Sea Hill. The grounds are quite pretty and meander up to the Leaning Cloud Pagoda built over 1300 years ago. A iconic structure. You cannot go inside the pagoda but great viewing and picture opps.
Suzhou Pagoda in December ,Stayed close to famous Pingjiang Road in Suzhou we took a public bus to pagoda park. Entrance is for season and non season. Even in December‚Äôs colder time the park and pagoda was nicelyüëç crowded. Slight hiking ü•æ on the top. No so nice view but definitely nice park to stay for some hours. Recommend
Must-see ...,"Personally, this is one of the most iconic sites of Suzhou. There is so much history here, with the signature pagoda. However, there is not much information in English. So, do some research or have a guide or guide book with you to get the most out of the visit."
Different architecture from most pagodas,"(Note that the location as currently shown on this site is off by almost 5 km.  You can find the actual location by looking for Huqiu tower or Hugiu Mountain scenic spot on Google maps). A large park with an interesting leaning tower at the top, and some good views over the northwestern part of Suzhou.   The pagoda is interesting in that not only is it leaning, but it is of stone (unlike the predominantly wooden pagodas of southern China) and the architecture is almost Indian in style.  The walk up is a fair climb, but it is gradual, mostly in the shade, and nicely landscaped on the way up, including a pond and a bridge.  It was not too crowded, either.There is sufficient English-language signage to give some idea of the significance of this site."
Lovely,"If you are fascinated by chinese style, garden and spiritualityn well you have to go there and enjoy your visite."
Suzhou's own leaning tower,This site is well worth visiting - a beautiful walk uphill through a huge Ginko avenue and a fascinating building at the top.
Beautiful tower on top of the hill,"This was a beautiful tower, that you can from many places throughout the city. The hill was a surprising adventure with fun gardens and waterfalls. There was a shuttle available for those that are tired like me. It wound around the hill to the top and the tower."
Beautiful and calm historical place,Definately worth the effort to visit. Parking facilities are good and the entire area is very peaceful and beautiful. Not too overrun yet - and the drive from the center city is not too long either. A must-see if you happen to spend time in Suzhou!
Special Day,It is really interesting place that you can enjoy your time and many unbelievable locations which you can take many pictures
Nice,Nice hill in the middle of town.  We were going to hike up (its about a 20 min hike) but after seeing you need to pay 60 CNY and that we could see the tower from the bottom we decided against it.  Our guide said the view was not that great from up above.  It is a leaning tower.
Pretty,"Had a bit of a nightmare finding the bus to get there so took a taxi in the end, but once I got there it was really nice. The pagoda was pretty impressive and there were other halls and pavilions you could look inside."
Good walk,We had been to Suzhou many times and never ventured here . Mid week there was hardly anyone at the park. It is a beautiful walk with the normal Chinese buildings. Very similar to many of any other park. The biggest issue at the moment is the surrounding area around the park . Massive infrastructure going on so it doesn‚Äôt make it attractable getting into the park. We then walked along the river to the market area. It took about an hour or you can take a boat down the canal .
Ok,Local tourists views and areaAccessible mostly by Taxi from hotelsGood looking building on a hill area
Interesting place to visit,"Not only do you get the story on the emperor who was buried here and how that caused the leaning tower, but there is also a large store and calligraphy learning centre on site.  Lots to see and buy,"
Symbol of Suzhou City,Historical place to see in Suzhou city. You should see inclined temple on the top of the hill. It was rainy in begining of August.
Nice surroundings too,Interesting old leaning tower set in a wonderful park. Behind the pagoda is a rock garden with a waterfall. You can easily spend some hours here.
What a great garden with a cool tower,"We did a day trip to Suzhou from Shanghai, taking the train, and one of the places we visited was the Tiger Hill. It's a really pretty area and has a neat leaning tower. The garden had tunnels and bridges and a small pond and tons of lovely large rocks. The learning tower is pretty and you can't get right up close to it but you can get to areas where you can see the really neat roof tiles on surrounding buildings. There is a pretty temple with Buddhas and the red drums outside. It is a very pretty area that feels far away from the big city. We were really glad we visited."
Surprisingly nice place - perfect escape from heat,"I was positively surprised how nice & big this place was. We spent around 2-3 hours walking around through bamboo, slowly going up to the pagoda & afterwards ending admiring the area around north exit.  Definitely worth to visit. Just be careful that from north exit  you‚Äôll either have to wait for public bus or  call didi. Otherwise you‚Äôll end up paying premium for black taxi drivers (= if you do not have didi in your pocket, go back to south gate & jump on normal bus from there)"
Paradise!,"If you are in Suzhou, it's a pity if you miss this place. The greenery and the Chinese landscaping is wonderful.Peaceful and Tranquil."
Leaning Tower of China,"Before even entering the premises of Tiger Hill, you would be able to see a tall structure standing at the top.¬†The Tiger Hill Pagoda is a seven-layer tower that boasts a 47.7 meters height and has started to tilt as time went by, now leaning 3‚Ä≥59 degrees to the northwest, thus it was also given the title ‚ÄòThe Leaning Tower of China.‚Äô You can easily spend about a couple of hours in this place as it is away from the hustle bustle of the city and the lush green surroundings calm you down.¬†Entry fee: ¬•80 (SG$16)Opening hours: 7:30 am ‚Äì 5:00 pm"
Like Pisa ,This place worth  a visit!  There is not so many visitors during our visit. Entrance 40 RMB. Main attraction is the inclined tower. There was also an art exhibition about the two towers Pisa and Tiger Hill. You can walk around see old Chinese houses and the tower that's it.
"Just a nice place to get away if you have a weekend, can be crowded","Good for groups families or just a quick getaway not far from Suzhou center , quick taxi ride,......"
Tranquil visit,"Worth the entry fee, excellent flora displays and tranquil setting, tower is slightly off centre Asias leaning tower of Pisa. Very nice outside food court and the flowers were stunning"
Stunning in spring,Spent the day here with my friends from Shanghai. The flowers were gorgeous and the place was of course immaculate. Got some fabulous pictures as it is all very scenic. A nice surprise was the installation of some modern art mostly as sculptures. Well worth the time to visit
Beautiful flower fields in the end of March,"We took a taxi from the old Suzhou to reach this place. We eventually found the ticket office when just walking towards the main entrance.. it was on the left-hand side. Not too much English info, but we managed to get the tickets alright. One of us was worried about the hike up the hill, so we ended up taking the tram. Turns out, the hill wasn't actually very high - around 35 meters according to the info text. But the tram ride anyways provided some nice views around the hill/island. For most people, the walk up is definitely doable. There were also some horse rides available, but the horses looked really sad and not too healthy. There are interesting spots around the Tiger Hill area (pagoda on top, pretty buildings, bonsai garden...). For us, the highlight was the beautiful flower fields on the sides of the hill. The smaller paths down the hill were less crowded than the main path. We spent around 2 h here, taking our time to enjoy the main sights and nature."
Landmark of Suzhou,"Apparently, the Emporer saw a white tiger while up on this hill, many moons ago, and so it's now called Tiger Hill.  The tower was built as a tomb, in honor of this emporer (or his wife?), and there are many tiger's engraved in stones, etc, around the gardens.  It leans a bit like Pisa, but it extremely old.   The overall grounds up on this hill also provide a nice view of the surroundings.  a MUST see while in Suzhou."
Walking tour,There are plenty of views to take pictures at. There will be people at the gate that are more than willing to guide you through the area. I went without a guide without an issue.
Beautiful Park,"Had an interesting afternoon here, very busy on New Year‚Äôs Day. Took the electric bus ride to upper level before climbing the last section to see the tower at the top. Lots of snacks for lunch on the way back down. Plenty of walks and places to amble around."
Great for sunrise,Wow! What a sunrise! I was more stunned about the mountain tips seen through the clouded skies! With a little TLC this will be beautiful. It has a lot of potential. Get there at 5.30 so you have time to watch the glow emerging from the horizon! We loved it. On the left will find the colours of the mountain and the right I‚Äôll be the sunrise itself. A little disappointed by the street vendor who sold water for double the MRP! This needs to be addressed. It was for my brother who was vomiting and I didn‚Äôt need to scavenge around for More money. Things to improve: the rubbish is disguisting! Bins are there and clearly not used. We had a smoker standing amongst hundreds of people. This should not be tolerated. These non smokers should be able to stand and watch the sunrise without inhaling their disgusting habit. This should be a 500 rupee fine along with littering. It‚Äôs a public space. It should be clean and pleasant.
Worth the trip,"It's a must do item on your Suzhou trip. Beautiful gardens , the leaning tower , the horse drawn carriage, don't forget to ring the bell(a lot more fun than expected ) . Go late in the day to avoid the crowds . You can see everything in about 2 hours"
Nice Family Activity,We went on a quiet afternoon (Chinese New Year Eve) and it was very nice. It is not the most stroller friendly place so take note if bringing a stroller. There are some very nice paths good for strollers but often turn into stairs. There is a nice path surrounding the park that trams and horse-carriages drive on which is easy to walk with a stroller. The gardens are beautiful. Great opportunity to learn about Suzhou ancient culture.
Leaning Tower of Suzhou,Either go with a tour guide or read about Tiger Hill before you visit this site. It is easy to visit.
Nice historic place,Its nice historic place in town. Just some minutes walk up hill and there are plenty of history in the places.
Tiger Hill ,We time the tram uphill. During the downhill walk we visit some of the attractions of this site. We die not see all due to our  guide.
Beautiful Garden with lots of legend and lore.,"We enjoyed climbing Tiger Hill to the tower.  It was busy on the main path which is fun and enjoyable because of all the legends that surround this location.But if you want to avoid the crowds, descend from the back side which wind back around to where you started without all the crowds."
Which kind of student?,"At Tiger hill site they are not accepted international students as ""general students"", they could not get student discount. This is not to not pay 60,00¬•, but because every student in the world is to be considered a student, without difference and discerning!!In the others Chinese landmarks I visited there wasn't this kind of policy!!I'm really annoyed about this thing!"
"Beautiful park, busy during weekends and holidays","Tiger hill is convenient to get to by didi or subway. I took a didi from sip and it wasn‚Äôt expensive at all. It was busy as I visited on a holiday, but still plenty of space and lots to see. The main temple is very nice, but I enjoyed walking around the grounds more. Lots to stop and look at and a little food market with maybe 10 stalls cooking hot food. The area also offers boat rides. I think I paid around 45rmb to enter the park."
Nice Place with Rich History,"Tiger Hill is one of the Best places to visit in Suzhou (other than Shantang street). It is huge with Beautiful garden, Tall & inclined Pagoda, Buddha shrine and Full of history from more than a thousand years. Sword Testing Stone and Sword Pond is another landmark of the historic site. Its better to do some research & read about Tiger Hill before you visit (if you dont know Chinese), so that you will be able to relate with the places there.Best way to reach, for tourists, is to take Taxi from Suzhou station to North Gate of Tiger Hill (Hu Qiu Tower). The Pagoda stands on the hill's summit and there are few steps to climb up the hill, also you can find places to sit around. There is a Canal around the Hill and you can pay to take a ride in a traditional boat (Avoid it, in my opinion)"
A better sense of history here,"It isn't the best park in the city, in my opinion, but there is a richer sense of history here. The buildings feel a little more haphazard in their placement and it has a more authentic feel to it than other locations in the center of the city. Whether this is true or not, I'm unaware."
Beautiful garden.,Beautiful garden indeed but the Suzhu classic garden brings something more which makes this place fade.
Very scenic area in middle of Suzhou,"This is a beautiful park in the center of Suzhou.  The tall Pagoda is the main attraction and is very nice to see.  It's not overly crowded like many other parks and Pagodas in China.  There is a small electric tram that will take you from the park entrance to the Pagoda at the top of the hill.  I strongly recommend spending the 20rmb for this service.   It's a very long up hill walk otherwise.  You can also take a horse and carriage to the top.  However, there is no return service provided - so you must walk back down and it's a long walk -so allocate enough time.  On a hot day, the shade and wind is very comfortable at the top.  Worth a visit."
Enjoyable Visit. Really Nice Historic Place.,"We really liked hanging around at the Tiger Hill. There are so many fascinating stories associated with it that we quite enjoyed our tour. There are several nice spots to take pics and the moat, garden and the walk upto the hill is quite comfortable. You can find places to sit around and also enjoy having a nice cool drink or an ice-cream from the shops that are here.The story of Emperor Wu is really famous, so make sure you do some research if you can, just so you know why this place is so iconic. Essentially, this is where he was buried."
"Nice pagoda, have enough time to visit","There are tons to see inside. Every floor has things to do. Top floor balconies will give you 360¬∞ view of the Hangzhou city. There is escalator to reach the pagoda. Yet, you need to climb some stairs. Inside the pagoda there is a lift to go up. There could be huge queue to access the lift. Habe enough time in hand (around am hour inside). We couldn't enjoy much as we hardly had 15 mins."
Walk among ancient history,Nice walk lasting a bit more than 1 hr. Nice park and few really old and important historical places. Small cave could be interesting for kids. The parking is close to this place.
Awesome area ,This place is a stunning little park. I recommend enter from the north gate as it has less tourists. Also be on the look out for side paths as there are a number of areas where there are no crowds!
Beautiful area,The Tiger Hill area is very beautiful and quite relaxing for tourists like me to go around. The long history of the tower is the main attraction and there are different Chinese buildings around it which you can have an understanding of the old China.
Very relaxing gardens,"Very nice. You have to spend a couple of hours. The best part, the bonsai garden from the bottom. The pagoda inclined as the pisa tower. The stone to test the swords....The best of Suzhou, no doubt ... much better than the canals of the old city ..."
A beautiful place,"Full of history from more than a thousand years in this place, the tower looks impressive when standing next to it  and the bonsai three garden is amazing."
Wonderful place ,"The famous leaning tower of China is a wonderful landmark and is set in some very beautiful gardens. Round the back of the hill is a tea plantation and a bamboo forest. It might be best to take an informed local with you to get the best of it, or read up on your Suzhou history."
Great for hikers,This is basically a giant outdoor museum with lots of beautiful wildlife. You have to walk a lot so be prepared. We happened to go when it was pouring so plan ahead because it rains a lot in Suzhou. There are great photo spots as well. Specifically in front of the Yun Yan Pagoda (A.k.a Leaning tower of China). And each sign has an accurate English translation for tourists. They have this horse too. He‚Äôs pretty cool. Rocking that Asian bowl cut dude!ü§òüèª
Be ready,Be ready to climb a few stairs to reach the pagoda. Similar to the Humble Administrators Garden - signs introducing key areas are in English and Chinese. Enjoyable visit but I would recommend the Humble Administrators Garden over Tiger Hill if you are short on time.
"Relaxing, well priced","A relaxing walk to unwind with some different landscapes and well priced (student discounted entrance fee is 40ÂÖÉ). Wouldn't consider it a must see, however if you have time (1-2 hours) it's not very strenuous and has some nice sights."
Best of the Suzhou Gardens,I lived in Suzhou for many years and make it my personal mission to visit all the gardens. I would have to say that Tiger Hill is my favorite. I was there recently visiting my friend Marc
Wonderful place,"After a beautiful historical walk of one hour on Shantang Street , along the river, visiting various original shops ,  passing beautiful 1000 years old  bridges  you reach the Tiger hill with its unique tower and wonderful garden. This walk up to the tower is a bit strenous , but you may chose a cart as well. The reward waits for you downhill at the river: booking a boat tour back to Metro station line 2. Its a whole day trip. So plan your time"
"great heritage, great experience","a wonderfull and very wide are with gardens, hideouts, historical houses and places.i really recommend a local guide who knows all stories from the past. mine knew a story ro almost every stone along the main road up the hill.the tower itself is an amazing piece of ancient chinese architecture with an even greater story. one feels like in the middle of one of these chinese martial arts movies with flying swordsmen and whirling fighters.under the trees of tiger hill one forgets the 20 billion people area surrounding it."
"Beautiful, relaxing and must see while in Suzhou ","Living in Shanghai, I have often heard of Tiger Hill in Suzhou, but literally had no idea what to expect. I was blown away by how beautiful, peaceful and serene it is! So much history! Even a 400 year old bonsai tree!! I even was able to get a lesson on bonsai trimming, which was super interesting. I would for sure take any of my China guests back here!"
Historic place,"The visit on Ëôé‰∏ò (Tiger Hill) would be best experienced with a tour guide. The guides would be able to share anecdotes on the smaller attractions around the pagoda, known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Asia. This is a nice place if you have time to learn about the history of China. The stone roads can be very slippery in the rain. Best visit on a good sunny day."
"Great grounds, tower and carriage ride","We visited Tiger Hill in Suzhou last week.  Suzhou has several temples, gardens and historic sites to see.  Tiger Hill is one of them.  It has a large, pagoda style building in a wooded setting.  At the base we learned we could see the area from a horse drawn carriage at 30 RMB per person, about $4.50.  It was a delightfully relaxing way to travel.  You could also make the trip in a multi seat golf cart type shuttle, but it only takes you one way.  The carriage is better.There's a tea house on the grounds, surrounded by a small tea plantation area.  Very nice to look at.We also say they had small boats that could take you around for a view from the water.Admission to Tiger Hill is about 80 RMB or about $12.00.  Here's a neat benefit of how they do things in China.  If you are in your 60's, that gets you a 50% discount.  In your 70's?  Admission is free!This was a fun place to visit!"
Weekend ,Nice to see! Some nice pictures! Go outside and enjoy the garden! Chinese Touristen are not interested in!
Visit only if you have nowhere else to go,It's just an average place. I would put priority in visitng one of the gardens instead of Tiger Hill.
Wonderful,"It is a lovely site in Suzhou and worth the visit.Be sure to wear comfortable shoes, easy clothing and bring water."
Best destination in Suzhou,"This was my favourite of the places to visit in Suzhou. Larger, more beautiful and not as crowded as the Humble Administrators Garden."
Classic place to visit,"Tiger hill is iconic in Suzhou. It stick up from what is a fairly flat region and has it's very own leaning tower on the top. The place is a mixture of classic Chinese gardens, water features, water falls etc. Near the entrance there is the normal tourist trap that sells overpriced junk souveniers. However, about 200m along the approach road you will find many dress shops selling made to mesure wedding, prom and evening dresses. If you are prepared to negotiate you will get a good deal."
An easy walk to the top,An easy walk uphill but pay for a guide. We had arranged all this from New Zealand which made everything stress free. She picked us up and provided fascinating information in perfect English. You need to produce your passport everytime you buy tickets or do anything in China .It is walking only but not steep at all. The gardens on the way are beautiful especially in spring and the story about the Emperor and his secret tomb plus the fate of the builders who knew where it was adds another dimension. You can't go up the tower at the top as they have just stopped it leaning but very interesting.
Disappointing,"After visiting several nice sites in Suzhou and surroundings, I was expecting something special but was disappointed. An old tower, small garden, no grand views and very busy. Would not suggest to go."
Beautiful ,When we arrived it was very crowded there is a long walk up to the Pagoda there are lots of flowers in various colours on the way.  The garden scenery is spectacular with rock formations as well along the way.
Sunday walk ,Worth to visit for a few hours but not more as this place is smaller than expected. Hard to reach if you don't use a taxi or bus.
"Beautiful sights, good walk.","Although it's a cold morning with 8 degree temperature, there're beautiful flowers on last day of Lunar New year with a good walk around the gardens and to the pagoda. Took plenty of pictures and had pleasant memories of the place.Will be back."
Sunday afternoon excursion,"A great walk with really nice pathways to the top of Tiger hill. Lots to see and really pretty whether in full bloom are early February! You don't have any trouble seeing the ""Leaning"" tower Pagoda."
Very interesting gardens and park,"Built on a hill, this park contains many gardens and walkways. Probably crowded in the high season but certainly worth visiting. Plan to spend time just wandering around. There is a tea house in the park (which is quite large) and many other things to see. Very well maintained from the flowers and bamboo forest to the unique tower and architecture. This is one of the great places to visit while in Suzhou."
Peaceful retreat to Tiger Hill,Very beautiful grounds surrounding an amazing tower that sits high on a hill. Great views and the other structures on the grounds are worth visiting. Incredible history of the place makes it a worthwhile trip.
Worth a visit,A few colleagues and I stopped by this site during a business trip to the area. We happened to go after a decent snowfall. It was beautiful with snow covering the foliage and ground. The tower and the park grounds are well maintained. It is defiantly worth an hour or two of your time.
Leaning Pagoda of the east ,"The highlight of this historical nature park is the leaning pagoda which located at the highest ground from the entrance.Climbing up the 100 steps of rocky steps before reaching the base of the pagoda is tiring but definitely worth the climb. There is a big bamboo garden at one corner of the park, leisure stroll among the bamboo trees definitely is so relaxing & refreshing !"
My first visit to Tiger Hill,My (adult) son & I spent at least 3-4 hrs at Tiger Hill. The history to learn about Tiger Hill was phenomenal. It seems unreal. If I came to China 10 times I would return to Tiger Hill 10 times. It was a great experience. The sights (stone work alone) I could take thousands of pics of it! Absolutely beautiful & its very well kept (& groomed). I highly recommend a visit to Tiger Hill!
Stunning place,"I absolutely loved spending a few hours enjoying the beautiful gardens & old Chinese architecture here. Definitely worth spending a good few hours here. It can get quite busy so it might take a while to find a peaceful spot & also consider you will be walking quite a bit.The ladies at the information desk near the ticket office were exceptionally friendly & helped us tremendously with finding our next destination. Overall, a brilliant experience."
Enjoyable relaxing atmosphere ,Enjoyable relaxing atmosphere really sums it up.  I very much enjoyed walking around the grounds.   Very much worth the visit
Walk it,Nice to walk the grounds and see some history. Must see in Suzhou. Take the boat ride around the tower. Sometimes a bit crowded.
Great site,Spend a good few hours soaking up some of old China. Some parts had to be re built after years of destruction. Fully enjoyed the day.
Fascinating Place,"Tiger Hill is a very interesting place to visit. The famous leaning tower of Suzhou. Pretty incredible location with many, many little things to discover."
Tiger Hill,Tiger Hill is a must to visit if you are in Suzhou. It is tourist destination no.1 in Suzhou and have a natural environment and great historic.
Pretty tower! Somewhat quick trip,"The tower is really cool to take photos of. It leans even more than Pisa, but you can't go inside of it. You have to hike a little bit uphill to get there, but it isn't bad. Some of the stones are slippery so I wouldn't recommend smooth bottomed shoes. If you took your time this would be a 2 hour visit, but we barely spent 1 hour here (without a guide). I think it was 60 RMB to enter which was a little more than I was expecting but not bad."
Wonderful tower,"It's a long walk through the park to get to get to,the Tower but is well worth it.  The guide told us interesting stories including that there is a cave underneath the tower with a King who is buried there along with 3000 swords!  They did drain the lake and found a cave under there but did not go further as it would have made the Tower unstable.  It does lean to one side and remixes people of the other one in Italy!  Toilets are on side but are of the Chinese type and can be ""grim"" at times."
Very interesting,It is a 14 metre climb to the top to see the pagoda which the locals call Chinese Pisa. It is over 1000 years old and is amazing to see.  The gardens and surrounding buildings are very interesting.  It is very crowded on the weekends.
Popular tourist spot,"After entering through a magnificent archway a short climb past the Sword Testing Stone and Sword Pool into well laid gardens. At the top of the hill stands the leaning Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple. The gardens contain other interesting features, temples, waterfalls and landscaped paths. Well worth a visit if you are agile."
Pisa tower in asia!,"They said the foundation of this tower is not the same. At the right side, the foundation is mud, and the other side is bricks. I was using small car to go up, you can walk also, but it would be so tiring. Going down from the hill, my group and I walked a hundred steps. And it‚Äôs easier than you go up..Worth to visit bcs there‚Äôs not much sight seeing you can see in SuZhou"
Fascinating,"Our tour guide took us here, glad we had her to help provide history and context. Very scenic, great sense of the weight of history and religion. Can be very peaceful and serene in the right circumstances."
THE HIDDEN GEM OF SUZHOU,"Another Historic Landmark that cannot be missed, short climb, however for those less energetic there is a tour car that can take you to the top.Different to the Suzhou Gardens, this offers a more natural scenery.Cloud Rock Leaning Pagoda, which is 7 stories high, is absolutely stunning - it reminded me of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The Suzhou Museum, have some of the relics that have been excavated from this site. If you looking to explore more of Suzhou, don't mis Tiger Hill."
An uphill walk to the pagoda,"This was an interesting walk, but up quite a lot of steps. We got to the base of the pagoda but there was no opportunity to go inside."
Tiger Hill,A lovely walk through a breathtaking garden.  We visited many gardens but this is one of my favourites.  Again so much history and purpose ina ll the achitectural elements of Feng Shu
Nice place but...,"It is a very nice historic park/ garden/ hill with nice fresh air, bamboo garden, ponds, leaning tower...I was expecting a short hike but indeed the park is very small and crowded with local tourists. I literally walked around the whole park (a full circle from the South Gate, stop by all of the spots, to North Gate and back to the South Gate) in an hour. Is a nice place but am not sure if the entrance fee (¬•80) justify it.I found Shantang street which you can walk from the South exit (around 45 mins to the main Shantang street) more fascinating. It worth the walk because along the path there are a lot of historical sites and you can see the all local houses along the river."
Nice park,"a lot of green a must see place in Suzhouif you travel alone , take a bus from center(no subway there yet)no variety of restaurants inside so bring food with you"
Coolest historic site in Suzhou,It's often hird to find historical sites in China.  this is an awesome one.  It is a great way to spend a day.
More lean than Pisa - so they say,"But the tower (Cloud Rock Temple Pagoda) is only one of the things to see at Tower Hill.  A large, mostly wooded area to the north west of Suzhou.  A Chinese garden on a grand scale, with buildings, ponds, rock formations and much more.  Or simply enjoy walking around the shaded woods.  The largest collection of Bonsai I have ever seen, being pains-takingly tended by gardens armed with a small pair of scissors."
Stunningly Serene,"This was a beautiful site to visit after the Suzhou gardens, as it offers a very different kind of natural scenery. Especially when there are crowds of people in Suzhou (like during the National Holiday), it is nice to stroll around the hill for some breathing room. The climb is not too long, but there is a tour car that can take you to the top if you're tired and want to save your energy for exploring the site. The cost is 80 RMB, but it is worth it. Lots of hidden gems to be found here.The pagoda at the top (Cloud Rock Leaning Pagoda), which is 7 stories high, is absolutely stunning - it reminded me of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. If you go to the Suzhou Museum, you can also see some of the relics that have been excavated from this site. The history of this place is also amazing - it dates back at least to the Three Kingdoms period, when it was part of the Wu Kingdom. Wu King Helu is said to be buried here, next to the legendary Sword Pond. The Sword Pond is said to have at least 3,000 swords buried beneath. King Helu's son is said to have orchestrated the murder of 1,000 men who worked on the tomb in order to conceal its exact location - this is where the rock plaza Thousand People's Rock gets its name. There are many other intriguing legends associated with this hill as well - I'd recommend looking them up before you visit!"
Nce sightseeing,Visited Tiger Hill last week with some buisness friends. We went there by taxi. The fair to visit is about 80 RMB not too much. Spend a half day over there and got some nice impressions.
Expansive gardens,"A ruined (and leaning!) pagoda atop the hill, surrounded by woods and gardens.  Much to see and stories to be told if you have a good guide, and if not then still a pleasant stroll."
Well worth a visit.,Another really interesting place to visit in Suzhou. The bridal shopping precinct nearby was an eye opener as well.
Must place in Suzhou,Visited there and it is a hill with a lot of visitors. Quite difficult to walk with kind trolleys. Of course place to visit with quests. Some one recommended a boat trip from Tiger Hill to SIP. Next time we will try that one.
Very Interesting Suzhou Tourist Sight,"I visited Suzhou in June 2017.  After visiting four classical Chinese gardens (Humble Administrator's Garden, Lion Forest Garden, Master-of-Nets Garden, Lingering Garden), I took a taxi to Tiger Hill.  The Tiger Hill complex is a very interesting place but be prepared to do a lot of climbing.  At the top is a famous tower.  You can pay to take a tram at some point which may make things easier.  You take the tram to the top, look at the tower (and naturally take some photos) and then walk back down.  In terms of a visit to Suzhou and Tiger Hill, a lot will depend on whether you are making a day trip from Shanghai or staying in Suzhou.  There is certainly enough to see and do in Suzhou for 2-3 days.  But for a day trip, visiting the gardens plus Tiger Hill as I did will take up most of the day."
Great place to walk up hill - leaning tower ,"Not ideal for disabled but great walk up Go to the sides and back to make sure you don't miss the pretty Buddhist temple , the chinese pray here Loads of chinese tourist , few non chinese Well worth the visit"
better than expected,"the grounds to this is surprising huge so you do get a sense of peace & tranquility to the gardens. Walk to the top is not strenuous but as the grounds are substantial, I'd wear trainers."
High School Trip to Tiger Hill Scenic Spot,"Ok, there isn't all that much in Suzhou really.  Yes there is food, Yes there is SILK and lots of it, EVERYWHERE, but if you need to be outside in the park, then you have to check out Tiger Hill.  It shouldn't be hard to find since you can see the Tower from so many parts of the area.  The grounds are very nice with clean bathrooms, when  you find them.  The Tower is pretty cool to see, but don't expect teens to be all that into it for very long.  Spend a couple of hours walking around and get some silk scarves!"
A great park with amazing sites.  Plan on a few hours at minimum.,"Tiger Hill is a must see site is Suzhou.  It has a multitude of different area and sites to see from gardens to the ""leaning tower of China"", to the natural springs, to the river boats, etc. etc.Also included if you walk to the top (there are carriage rides to the top for those who want or need them - if you are in a chair or on crutches the carriage ride would be an absolute must, but a good workable solution to able to see the top) you get beautiful views of Suzhou.Entry fee is CNY 80 (about $12) per person for the day, half for students and youngsters."
A must visit in Suzhou!,"A vibrant place for visitors that tells you of Suzhou's rich history. It is truly a remarkable place to be. So, if you ever visit Suzhou, don't forget to dropby the Tiger Hill.As the saying goes : "" You've never been to Suzhou if you've never visited Tiger Hill"""
Good nature walk to see the Leaning Tower,"We had a good walk through beautiful nature towards the Leaning Tower. The walk was not too hard, though you can pay for rides instead. The scenery is nice and has a calming effect. The high point (literally) is the Leaning Tower. On the way down, enjoy the coolness of the toilets! Haha!After the walk, we took the river cruise to our lunch venue. It is worth enjoying the river scenery."
Showing Chinese guests over tiger hill,"I was staying in Suzhou studying, when some Chinese friends from Ningbo arrived, asking me to show them around. Since Tiger Hill is said to be one of the sights of Suzhou and I hadn't been there, I took them ... I have to say it was just ok, a hill, a garden, but nothing at all memorable, so much so that I remember only the leaning tower, which naturally brought to mind the tower of Pisa.  A pleasant walk, nothing more."
"Wonderful expansive property - I can see how the monks had time to read, write and meditate","The pagoda at Tiger Hill provides an interesting view of a 7 story tower built in 959. I really enjoyed exploring the grounds with so many different views with water, trees, bamboo, bonsai, tea plants.It was very hot, so 2 hours was enough, but would love to be able to spend more time just sitting and relaxing here."
Most Tranquil setting in Suzhou,I have been going to Tiger Hill for Years. Having lived in Suzhou I would seek out the solitude and tranquility that this ancient yet beautiful spot would give me. Stressed from the office I would go mid week when few crowds were there. Wander the ancient buildings and places. Imagine standing where Marco Polo and Kublai Khan would chat. Sends goose bumps up my next. I would leave a very calm and different man then when I entered. So many photo opportunities I cannot count!
Nice landscape,"This scenic area is an ancient hill park with cultural relics, tombs of ancient kings, pagoda, pond, garden with beautiful landscapes. The iconic Tiger Hill Pagoda stands on the hill's summit. At the pagoda top, one has a good view of the surrounding city.There are also other attractions such as Sword Testing Stone, Sword Pool, Lu Yu Well and Wanjing Villa. The villa is a garden full of potted landscapes and bonsai. Worthwhile to visit this place in Suzhou."
Feels like part of an ancient martial arts setting,Tiger hill feels like you have been transported to an ancient martial arts setting. One can almost imagine Chinese swords men flying around. Hire a guide to learn more about the history of the hill. Very scenic and the hike up can be done at a slow and leisurely pace.
Very interesting especially the stories when you are climbing up.,When climbing up to the pagoda you pass interesting stones (rocks) with a story. Also a monument where a girl was burried and the tell you the story.
This place is much better than the various type of Gardens in Suzhou,"If you are adventurous, have the stamina and want to explore, this is the place you should visit. As you enter the attraction, you can proceed to the bridge and go straight hiking up the steep stairway towards the leaning Pagoda. You can easily spend more than 2 hours if you want to explore all the area. If you are exhausted or do not want to walk, you can take either the buggy or the cart pulled by a horse to go around the compound. We were lucky that the place was not crowded when we visited immediately after their 3-day public holidays on 31-May. You can also take a boat to tour the canal/river and surrounding area. Nice place for a half day hike/tour. Do remember to wear comfortable clothing and sport shoes for quite an extensive hours of walking."
Cool spot in Suzhou,"Nice scenic spot outside of Suzhou. Took a cab from town up to tiger hill and loved all the plants and old pagodas and buildings. It's a nice easy hike that kids can do and lots of places to explore. The moat around is pretty and the boat ride is fun. The bamboo forest and tea field is so beautiful and all of the foliage feels very peaceful. If you go out the south exit, walk towards the river and hop on a tour boat! Such a cool ride watching the locals use the river and looking at all the old buildings. It will drop you off amongst red lanterns and restaurants and street food stalls. A great experience. Boys ages 3 and 6 loved it."
A less famous leaning tower,"The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, ""It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill."" I would agree with this statement. The gardens were wonderful and peaceful and the tower on the top of the hill leans precariously. Many myths and legends surround Tiger Hill; my favourites included the sword testing rock; the sword pond in which 3000 swords are said to have been buried and the Spring of Simplicity and Honesty (who could not enjoy a legend named thus)."
Beautiful park and pagoda,"The park is beautiful and the pagoda has a slight inclination due to the inappropriate foundation. The myth behind the name (tiger hill) is probably the most interesting feature. However, if you are in Suzhou you probably shouldn't miss it."
Just another park with a beautiful Pagoda,"If the place is not crowded it's a nice place to spend an afternoon. It is hilly, and you can have some nice views"
a major attraction in Suzhou,"I loved the garden, the pagoda, the folklore.  It was, fortunately, not too busy.  Flowers line the path up to the pagoda, a local group of young women performing, the ritual of springtime be it in China or back home.  It was a most pleasurable experience and one that should be seen when visiting Suzhou"
Nice little walk in tiger hill,"You can do this easily in 1-2 hours if you are in a rush. Price is 80 yuan per person but if you have your passport and student card, you can get a half price discount. Well worth the visit. Again, avoid weekends and holidays..."
Leaning Pagoda ,"When in Suzhou, this is a must see sight.  We hired a tour guide, which is highly recommended because there aren't any literatures to provide background.  As other reviewers shared the grounds are beautiful. The tour guide shared not to take photo with the pagoda as it is a tomb and it would be bad luck. English tour guides are nonexistent. There are two paths up to the pagoda, the straight walk up or the paved path, taking a cart.  If you are pressed for time, take the cart up and walk down.  While on the ride, you will get to see a tea plantation.  You can get to Tiger Hill by taking a boat tour from Shantang Street.  Also you can save some money when you buy boat tour and admission to Tiger Hill together."
Must visit place in Suzhou,This is one of my favorite garden and pagoda in Suzhou. unfortunately tickets are too expensive but must seen. there is small temples inside small lakes.. all the information about important things are  written but in chinese. pagoda inside looks like pizza tower in italy.
Historical site,"A must visit when you are travelling to Suzhou. The Tiger Hill Pagoda, more officially the Yumyan Pagoda, nicknamed the Leaning Tower of China."
Wonderful cultural outing,"I took a taxi from my hotel to Tiger hills.  It dropped me off at the ticket booth where I picked up a ticket and then spent a good chunk of the afternoon walking around the part exploring the beautiful grounds.  There is a tea house there as well as gift shops, visita points, and a number of historical buildings.  I decided to walk back to town along the canal and then took the metro back to my hotel.  It was a very pleasant way to spend my one day off on my business trip."
Nice place to see some historic from Suzhou,It#s a nice place to see historical Suzhou and get a good impression. Special Tipp: Take the boat down the channel back to the old town of China.
Stunning gardens,"There is so much to explore and see here from the tower itself to the various buildings housing rock sculptures and bonsai to the bonsai gardens and the water features. Bring walking shoes, or have a horse drawn carriage or electric tram cart you around. There is a lot to see."
All day trip.  Plenty of walking!,I had a day of so I went with a friend from Taiwan.  Tower was an amazing sight.  We took a boat ride back to an area that was easier to get a subway ride back to the hotel.
Amazing site,"Absolutely recommend this for any trip to Suzhou. I've been numerous times and love going. It's beautiful, has interesting history and is a great place to spend a few hours."
Tiger hill pagoda,One of the best parks .can easily spend a day . Enough things to explore ... entry fee is 60 RMB per head .
Fantastic park,This garden is shows how is the beauty of nature and chinese only choosed to build their heritage in the middle of the green gardens Great relaxing view with very comofortable colors to the eyes
Crowded,Went there during the holiday and got disappointed! There are sooooo many people in this place that made us decide not to climb the hill.
Loved it,"Although it was super crowded, it was incredibly beautiful. It was much larger than I anticipated and spent much more time there than I thought I would. There were many different cool sections to look at and historical artifacts to view as well. I would recommend this to everyone. There's a reason why it's called Suzhou's number one attraction."
"Interesting history, especially as to why the Pagoda is tilting!","Another wet day but the walk around this attraction was worth it. Nice gardens and some good photo ops. Pagoda looking a bit ""tired"" (not well maintained)."
Good surprise!,"Not only the pagoda itself, but the whole park is extremely beautiful. Good place not very crowded with tourists (in Chinese standards)."
Beautiful and interesting ,My favourite place in Suzhou. So beautiful and green. An excellent place to wonder around and kid friendly.  Interesting history and quite a bit of information around to read.  Costs 60 to enter and well worth it.
Hill attraction in Suzhou,"Been there on 03.12.2016. Entrance fee 70 yuan.  It has ancient garden decorations and some beautiful lake within the hill. The most interesting spot will be the pagoda at the top of the hill. Takes around 2 hours for the visit.  Compared to Humble administrator's garden, this place is bigger but I feel is less interesting. From the south entrance you can also buy boat tickets to Shantang street which cost 55 yuan."
A good attraction for me because of a complimentary guided tour in chinese to help me understand the history behind this,I went in December and a ticket cost 60 RMB (ticket prices may vary based on season). It was a good trip because there was a guide (explained in chinese) who can be requested at the area along the right lane after entry. This helps to give you insights about the pagoda and the legends behind the attractions at this place. Not any different from many other similar attractions though. Please visit if you have time and you might like to know more about this Hu Qiu Shan.
Not worth 60RMB,"The smalk walk up the incline is nice, weaving through various gardens and stones. The tower is nice but entry isn't permitted as it is tilted. The view from the hill top was a bit disappointing with too much urbanization around. All in all a nice place but not worth the entry fee."
Lovely!,Absolutely gorgeous location.  The gardens are wonderful and nice mix of history involved within the attraction as well.  One of my favorite places in Suzhou
Very nice walk in beautiful environment,"I would definitely recommend this place far more better than the traditional crowded gardens in Suzhou.It is BIGGER, you can spend half day here if you want, take lunch with you and sit somwhere and make a picnic. The place has forests inside, so you can enjoy a calm walk, but you also won't miss the typical scenery of tradtional architecture with ponds and bridges nearby.You can also take a carriage with a horse to move from one end of the garden to the other.I was just a little disappointed as the tower isn't opened for visiting as I expected. Definitely recommend to visit the place!"
The leaning tower of Suzhou,I simply love this attraction. We went during the off-peak season so not too crowded. Nice little walk/climb up the small hill to see the Sword Pool and then the leaning pagoda.
"a lovely green ""island"" in the middle of suzhou",Loved the garden here - the whole hill a small forest garden with historic buildings and relicts. The tower itself is also worth seeing.
Peaceful site,"This is the first time we were visiting this hill.We were here in November and the weather was comfortable. The fall color just emerging and a little fog on the day we were there. We had hired a tour guide, speaking Mandarin, and took the tram up to the hill and walk from the top to bottom with the tour guide. It will be a long walk or climb to walk up to the top of the hill. Do use the tram service!!!This site does have a lot of history and many stories if you are interested. I would really like to come back here and takes a lot of photos. The site is huge and will takes some time to see every corner of it. I would come back again if I have a chance to visit again."
Beautiful site well worth the trip,Tiger Hill was very interesting. Best part was walking Shantang St to get there. Really got a chance to see old Suzhou. You miss so much with the boat or bus trip. Walking helps you experience the people.
Local Tourist area of note,The most popular of area for Tourists. Needs a Taxi to it Anne the entrance areas. It's a big place so be ready for the walking.
Amazing sunset and lovely boat trip,"My husband and I went on bus 146 all the way. It's either 1 or 2 RMB to get there depending on the month. The entrance fee was 60 RMB. We entered the gate by the bus terminal. We entered and then took the boat ride half way around the area. There is some construction work going on, so we couldn't go all the way around. The pagoda, trees, flowers, and surrounding area is lovely. Friends went on a rainy day and enjoyed the fact that it wasn't busy. We went on a sunny day and the sun set and it was lovely. All the other tourists were very happy to see us (lots of pictures to be had). On the way out, we walked through small streets where people are selling trinkets. I believe it closes at 5 and they don't let anyone in after 4:30."
Charming park,"Wonderful park with many ancient relics, interesting legends connected with different places and 1100-year old inclined pagoda"
One of the most nice place,In my plan for you in Suzhou to visit this place because old history and nice nature is also very nice for people interested in historical place
A brisk uphill walk through history,This was interesting because it was different. A huge leaning pagoda on top of the hill with various other sights on the way up plus local history. Seemed to suit locals as well as tourists
The first Chinese leaning tower,"The Tiger Hill has lots of trees, and it just like a forest. We went there in the afternoon but no sun that day. So we felt a little bit cold when we walk around. There were few roads to go to the hill, so my friend and I decided to walk separately. I chose the road that few people walked to go up the hill and the road that most people walked to go down the hill. I really liked the road that I went up the hill. There were some pavilions and buildings with the elements of Suzhou gardens along the road. However, it was pity that when I reached to the top of the hill, I found that the tower was being renovated. All of the visitors could not get close to it, so I just took some photos from the top of the hill and go down the hill.Don‚Äôt worry about climbing the hill, for the altitude of tiger hill is not high and the roads are very flat. It is a good place to go in a hot day, because you are hard to see the sun with lots of tall trees and you may feel a little bit cold if you sit in the pavilions to take a rest."
One of many reasons to come to the magical city of Suzhou,"There are several aspects of Suzhou, China that convince you that there does not exist an appropriate adjective nor collection of adjectives that helps describe the beauty of this place, and Tiger Hill is one very clear example of this. From the pagoda to the beautiful old buildings overgrown with vegetation to the canal surrounding the park, this site must be experienced in person to grasp the full magnitude."
Leaning tower of China,A must see. Lovely area steep in history. Also is surrounded by lovely gardens and green space. Lush forest and a river and ornate bridge gives you a sense of peace in the city.
Beautiful garden and the leaning tower,"Great place to visit in Suzhou! Leaning tower which has been there for more than 1000 years, beautiful gardens, particularly Bonsai garden, nice Architecture."
Very nice tower and city views,"This is a beautiful park and historic area in Suzhou. Went on a sunny Sunday and took a boat ride, climbed the hill to the tower (stairs), and learned about the site. Recommended!"
Historic and really cool.,"An international Historic Site that gives a great feel for what ancient Suzhou must have been like. It was definitely worth visiting, but since it's all outdoors, you should not go unless the weather is good.It's a large site, and takes quite a bit of time to cover. It would probably be very difficult a wheelchair. I would recommend renting a headset with narration in your own language. I think I would have missed a great deal had I not had that resource. The only negative I would make is that the maps showing where things are we're all located around the perimeter. Once you were deep into the site, there was nothing to look at that could tell you where to go next. I spent a lot of time there, but I'm not sure I saw everything. Maybe there were paper maps that I could have taken with me, but if so I missed them."
50th wedding anniversary Family vacation,Its hard to believe this predates the Leaning Tower Of Pisa yet you never here of it unless you are in Sushou. Well worth the visit to walk thru the gardens and climb the hill to see the pagoda . One can only imagine what it was like in bygone years when the monks worship at this facility and the serenity of the area
must visit!,"Tiger Hill is huge with plenty of steps - but there are plenty of open places where you can take rests.as one of the previous viewers have stated, best to hire a guide who can explain all the historical significant of all the attractions because most of the signs (that provide background information) are only in Chinese."
Bitter and sweet experience,"My experience was bitter here, because a short while before the visit to this place my camera was stolen. The area and location is absolutely beautiful. It has an extreme atmosphere when there is a light rain around the area. The old Suzhou is also fantastic."
Better with a guide,"There were a few guides(Mandarin speaking) near the entrance that offered their service for 50 yuan, we decided to give it a try.  Best 50 yuan spent!!(We also encountered a couple of English speaking guides leading different group in the park, so they are out there.)He led us through with very easy pace.  We took the shuttle to the leaning pagoda on the top of the hill(with fee) and walked down.  He pointed out the sights, explained to us the meaning behind the details in the designs, and the history behind all things.  We learned so much about the poets as well.Beautiful garden.  It was a cool and breezy day with the threat of rain.  Not much crowd, unfortunately the beautiful dancing show was cut short due to a wet stage.  If you want, you can walk the whole stretch of shantang street from there.  A beautiful, quiet walk that will lead you to the busy section."
pagoda,is it true that there is 3000 thords under the pagodaif you want to know come to tiger hillsolo or with other people
"A must as this Pagoda also leans like the ""leaning tower of Pisa""","Another attraction that one should visit.  Of course, lots of tourists but not an issue.  Prepare for a short hike to reach the top but nothing straneous.  I recommend going EARLY to avoid the crowd, heat and more time to enjoy the hike, nature in the early hours and better photo ops.Bring water if you do not want to buy.  There plenty of vendors along the path so not to worry about if you forget to bring them."
Truly a must see,We were unsure exactly what tiger hill was but set out based on trip advisor recommendations. This was easily the best thing we did in Suzhou. We would see this over the Humble Administrators Garden
Nice garden to visit on lazy afternoon,"well we have chosen to visit tiger hill because of some saying ""You haven't been to Suzhou unless you visited Tigerhill .. "" And actually we were not to impressed .. beside that the garden was very well maintained and then you could see the tower, which was one of the Icon of Suzhou and also the pool .."
A must visit place if you are in Suzhou.,One of the places you have to visit. Beautiful and full of history. Very nice walk. Go in the morning and take boat ride to other place.
Huge area,"A great place to visit, there are different things to look at.You can enter on one side and exit the other side."
By far the best thing to do in Suzhou,"Amazing amazing place to visit, seeing the leaning tower and just walking around the grounds, so magical!!"
Beautiful nature with lots of history,"This is the Chinese equivalent to the leaning tower of Pisa. The temple at the top of the hill is also leaning, but it was stopped before it get to the point where it could collapse by the government who wanted to protect the building. The nature around is very pretty and the short trip to the tower has a lot of history that a guide can tell you about, which I would recommend, getting a guide that is."
The famous pending tower on top of a hill ,"This site has 2500 years history but as almost every time in China you can't feel itWell for Chinese Suzhou is said to be heaven on earth The area is covering around 3 hectares with some nice parks.The main attraction is the pending pagoda. Quite impressive but you can't enter it.A few other site look the sword pond, a temple and others are located in this park.If you are not Familiar with Chinese history still you can enjoy the green around and the bonsai collection in the potted garden."
Absolutely Beautiful. ,Very well maintained. Calming atmosphere. Large crowds- like all of the good sites of China. The horticulture is amazing. Particularly liked the Bonsai.  A must see.
DO NOT MISS if in Suzhou,"we paid 20RMB to get driven by a cart. will advise you do that otherwise it is a LONG walk. We had a guided tour which helped to understand the significance of some places. I took great pictures. i can understand why many famous poets have written about this place. it was worth seeing. unfortunately, it was part of a packaged tour so i dont knwo if there was an entry fee or not. The Tour guide made everything very easy"
Leaning tower of Suzhou ! ,Came here with few expectations but the tower is incredibly ornate for something 2000 years old and it's definitely Leaning !
Beautiful scenery but a little dull,"It's a super nice scenery, but it's a bit boring compared to what is written thereonIt is a good walk in the woods with much history and myths"
Not to be missed,Tiger hill is incredible.  Steeped in history and incredibly beautiful.  One of the few places in Suzhou where you can get lost and find empty spaces of tranquility and beauty.
Nice for an invigorating walk if not crowded,This is among the better choices for water  and garden type visit. Has historical value as well. Provides for a nice walk among the greens. Keep 1-2 hrs if you have time. Wear comfortable shoes
A place for honeymoon,"A place for honeymoon. Many pretty flowers here. Similar to Vietnam but with Chinese names. Also, a good place to take photos for souvenir."
Nice garden,Chinese Version of the leaning tower...a place to relax and brisk walk to see the flowers and bansai... man made waterfall and others.. Worth the walk but the only thing will be slightly off the city area... Have to have someone to bring around else the Black market will be there to ask for the transport fees.. Cheers
Busy but still has quiet atmosphere in most parts,"My first time to visit Tiger Hill, unfortunately on a day of almost 40C heat. Still it was a very interesting walk, and quite a pretty place with things to see. I am not a fan of tour guides, but we had someone join in English (it is included in the ticket if you have a Mandarin guide). This is worth it as the presentations are interesting. Even though crowded, we did find some quiet parts ‚Äì the small garden tends not to get much attention it seems, so this was nice to be in. Nice place to visit even if I would do it again with some cooler weather."
"History, Garden Like Park, and Convenience","This is a less crowded place comparing to the Humble Administrator's Garden.  So I felt we can appreciate the nice scenery and the history behind it a little better..  We took the mobile cart to go up because we went with our parents, but we took a nice walk after we settled them."
Very nice,"We went to Suzhou for a weekend getaway. It's a nice city, with lots of typical Chinese Gardens. Tiger Hill was nice, very busy on Sat-Sun, even melting/steaming hot weather didn't stop crowd of tourists. In general we had very good impression, I'd like to get back in late October though, it's unbearable hot now and as you need to hike a lot, and there is no shadow... Was pretty tough, so just as a suggestion for tourists who only thinking about visit this place in summer - wear as minimum and make sure you have enough water!"
Nice place ,It's a nice place to be ... Nothing great about this place but worth a visit if you have lot of time then you should visit this place you won't regret ur decision ...
An absolute MUST in Suzhou,"Tiger Hill is not exactly in the center of the old town but worth spending a few CNY to reach it. An amazing place with a great pagoda on top of the hill and a nice view. Start at the north end, climb the hill and go down on the south side!!!"
Leaning Pagoda,Tiger Hill is a large park with the leaning pagoda as the center piece.  It is a good place to spend half a day and enjoy the grounds and a picnic.  A lot of walking is required to see the entire area and there are many steps.  It is good for a family outing.
The best of all in Suzhou,None of the gardens gave me the same level of enjoyment as Tiger Hill did. Must see for everyone visits  Suzhou.
Couldn't have been prettier,The grounds were lush and beautiful. The paths were in prefect condition. This was a fascinating place--not to be missed!
Beautiful,We didn't have time to get too close to Tiger Hill but the views don't disappoint. Next time look forward to spending more time to take in the Pagoda.
Beautiful scenary,"Good history lesson knowing that Tiger Hill Pagoda was built earlier than the leaning tower of Pisa. Both towers are leaning. Scenic mountain,river and garden. Plenty of places to walk around and exercise away from the city."
Pagoda is worth a visit,Entry fees was around 70 Yuan. Good to visit once. easily takes around 4-5 hours. Lot of stairs in some places so it will be easy on your feet if your fitness levels are good or can become quite exhausting by the end of it. Special cultural performances by locals is a highlight of this place and must see. Shows are around 3 times a day so plan your trip accordingly.
Yunyansi Pagoda,"TIGER HILL PAGODATiger Hill Scenic Area also called Huqiu (Khochou) Mountain is an ancient hill park of 53 acres in Suzhou city of China where a number of memorials with legendary tales such as sword testing stone, precious cultural relics, tombs of kings including King Hu Lu tomb (476 BC), pagodas, pavilions, temples and scenic spots with excellent landscape are situated. On the hill top is located an octagonal Tiger Hill Pagoda (also called Yunyan or Yunyansi Pagoda), built in 961 AD. It is the Leaning Tower of China like Pisa Tower in Italy and King Palace Tower in Shiraz. The Pagoda has seven floors with a total height of 47 meters.	The tower leans roughly 3.59 degrees due to forces of nature and the cracking of two supporting columns. There is a difference of 2.32 meters between top and the bottom of the leaning pagoda."
Beutiful gardens and neat old buildings/ruins,"Lots of lovely gardens, a bunch of really neat old buildings, ruins, and cultural displays. On the walk in you're channeled through some of the poorer areas of Suzhou where locals have set up stalls on the street (bit of a tourist trap, but still quite neat).We really enjoyed Tiger Hill, it was probably the high point of our sightseeing adventure in Suzhou. Going through the poorer areas to get there was a real eye opened as well, it's a night and day difference to the more affluent areas of the city, and really shows the huge dissonance in wealth across the classes."
Beautiful gardens,"You can take the bus here from downtown, ask at your hotel. Entrance to Tiger Hill is ¬•80/adults. Lovely to stroll around. Can be crowded. Clean bathrooms were appreciated (BYO paper).We walked back to downtown, a lovely stroll along the water and easy to follow."
The leaning tower of Suzhou!,"It's wasn't the best of days but it was worth the trip to see the fascinating leaving tower of Suzhou, along with the pretty gardens. I would say the price is a little expensive at 60 RMB for entry. To get here just head to shantang street and head up the stream (after the walking street), it took us about 20-30 mins to walk it but you come across some great old fashion looking Chinese houses (something you don't really see if you take the boat up stream). You kind of feel like you're in old China, it's great! A must if in Suzhou."
"Interesting enough, but read the small print...","An interesting place to visit and very popular with the locals. The gardens are fun to explore but as you wander around, you begin to question how old some of the park is. You'll start to see a bit of concrete reinforcement and the odd-fibreglass 'rock' and realise that it's part theme park, part relic. The tower itself has obvious been subject to the same work through the years. Maybe I'm just spoiled by living in Britain and being surrounded by 'old stuff'.The streets around the southern entrance are a great place to watch everyday China - try the Hai Hotel for lunch if you dare..."
"Historic, of More Interest to Chinese Citizens","While this is a nice park-like atmosphere and has many historic features, including the very old leaning stone pagoda, it was very crowded and I think the history is of greater interest to Chinese people.  Not every feature was explained in English, so it was good to have a guide who could explain the historical associations."
"If you are into pagodas, this is good....","Although a very good example of the pagoda, there is not a lot else around.  It was  one stop for us as part of a tour, and was appreciated by many, but apart from the garden that you walk through to get there and a few other ornate buildings around it there was not a lot more to see,"
Good palce,"I visited this place at the end of April. It is a big place ,huge one . So you need to discover and walk all around . The weather was hot so i advice u to visits it in march  ' spring season' to enjoy the trip . Otherwise visit it in summer not a good idea at all.üòÖ"
Tiger hill ,"Go, it's really interesting but try and go when it's quiet as otherwise the crowd pushes you along. Can be very busy but worth the effort."
Average tour ,It's a nice day out in the park but I would not have chosen this if I knew this was all it is. If you are fanatical about Chinese history and don't have anything else to do it's probably worth a visit however I wouldn't of wasted an afternoon out to go and see this if I knew this was all that was there.
Extensive Site with multiple Attractions,"One of the Top tourist sights in Suzhou, Tiger Hill is identifiable from a distance by the pagoda at its summit. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here walking around the extensive site and taking in the different attractions. There are miles of paths through woods, up and down the slopes, across small bridges, through bamboo groves, across Pagodas, Pavilions and Gardens- so make sure to wear light and comfortable shoes! Its easy to get lost or to missing something since the signage isn't the best, so get a map, or take a picture of one at the entrance to use later. Since I came to Suzhou to see its gardens, my favorites at Tiger Hill were the garden near the entrance/exit (I think it was the North Entrance), and the bonsai garden - which was the most extensive of any of the bonsai gardens I saw in Suzhou.A word about he garden near the north entrance/exit. Suzhou is deservedly renowned for its classical gardens, and I had spent the previous day tramping through 3 of the most famous- the Humble Administrators, Lion Forest and Ouyuan, which are all lovely antique gardens at least a couple hundred years old. Though well restored and impeccably maintained, the patina of age does show in these gardens, and they have that lovely faded charm that old things have. The garden near the north exit at Tiger Hill on the other hand looks brand spanking new, but has lost nothing in the process. I am not sure whether it is newly constructed, or merely recently restored, but the result is a Chinese garden that has all the elements and charm of a traditional Chinese garden, but the sparkling clean look of something that was built yesterday, and gives you an opportunity to appreciate what the classical gardens might have looked like when freshly built. Long story short- if you've come to Suzhou to sight-see- you can't miss Tiger Hill. And if you have even a slight interest in gardens, don't miss the one near the north entrance."
Not worthy to go,This is the worst place I ever go . Don't hope to get free explanatory service at there even though was label as free. not baby friendly as well
Lovely Scenery at Tiger Hill,"If you are a photographer like I am, Tiger Hill Suzhou is a very lovely area where some great photo opportunities can be had.  There are many different scenic spot along the walkways here that are quite beautiful - Bonzai garden, Tiger Hill trail and bridge and Tiger Hill pagoda are all very nice to see.  The atmosphere here is very relaxing to walk around and take in the scenery. Some photos attached is just a sampling of the great scenic view here."
Rather too many people for my liking,"it was a lovely sunny sunday when we visited here, and therefore the locals were out in force.  If you can get away from the centre of the area and just enjoy the walks around the outside, it was a lovely morning."
Good but crowded and rainy,"This was my second visit and it was much more crowded this time, despite the rain. We enjoyed the less crowded gardens, scenic overlooks, and a horse-drawn carriage ride. The main drawback is the sales pressure from street sellers at the entrance and exit."
Impressive place,"Tiger Hill is located north of Suzhou. about 20 minute driving from new Suzhou zone. Take a taxi, because taxi price in China is cheap.Entrance ticket of Tiger Hill was 80RMB per person. Quite nice place with eye catching flowers and trees. Also there is a canal in the temple, you can rent a boat for 160RMB. I strongly recommend it. boat riding takes you 30 minute and you can take some nice pictures."
Great Park,"Well worth a visit. Our children loved the opportunity to run around the bus and to go rock jumping. We also took the horse and cart ride, very pleasant and then a boat back to Shantang Street."
Fun morning or afternoon trip,"Park full of interesting history and architecture, can easily have a few satisfying hours here. The leaning pagoda on top is definitely the highlight, but the whole park is full of ancient residences."
Well worth a visit,"Tiger Hill, where the Yunyansi Pagoda is situated is a beautiful area and well worth a visit.   The walks around the monument are refreshing amongst the trees and there are small pools of water amongst the rocks that provide a contrast. Children were scampering over the rocks and thoroughly enjoying their day out.  The Pagoda is a wonderful example of engineering and looks quite magnificent. The attached picture gives the details of the monument."
Beautiful in Spring ,"Lovely afternoon out in the sunshine! Beautiful area to explore and soak in history and culture. The potted flowers of several varieties, then waking on up there are various Buddhist temples and the amazing Pagoda itself. The Bonsai tree garden is crazy but worth a look."
Get your camera ready!,This is a good place to learn the local culture. Need a guide to explain. I was lucky to catch a good season where there were not too many tourists and the flowers were in full bloom. The weather is great at about 13C with no rain.
Beautiful Pagoda and parks,This is best visited in Spring/Summer when the flowers are all in Bloom.  It proves the ingenuity of the ancient Chinese that they could even build these structures with a precise lean to the North- east.
Wonderful landscape full of history and myths,"This place is full of interesting stories since the Three-Kingdom Dynasty and the pagoda is over 1000 years old. Free Chinese speaking tour guide is available at dedicated time slot, remember to check out at the inquiry counter. Please beware of false ticket sales and there are also booths and stalls trying to sell food and fruits at expensive price at the entrace and exit, if you really want to buy please compare a few stalls before you buy."
Beautiful pagoda,"A hauntingly beautiful pagoda, with treasures as yet undiscovered from a cavern underneath it.  The gardens are very peaceful and the history of Tiger Hill very interesting.  Go with a guide or a tour if you can to fully appreciate the history of the place."
Good place to go with your families,"We are living here around,usually i take my daughter there to watch flowers blossom.It's a good place to walk,trees and flowers much, so the air is good.In the morning you can see many old residents do exercises here.Spring is the best time here.Summer is hot and winter is cold."
Leaning Tower in China,"About 30 years ago I went there and just know one beautiful tower there, this time I went there again with one guild, then I was told that tower is one famous leaning tower in China,which built more than 1000 years ago. You may learn the history of the Tower, same time you may see the modern city around."
A Place to spend a day,"Massive garden filled with many sights and forested areas, so much to see and do that you will require a day or longer, well worth a second visit"
Beautiful historical garden,"Absolutely enjoyed my visit to tiger hill today. If you are into ancient Chinese history and mythical stories, a visit to this ancient garden is a must. I highly recommend hiring an official guide from the tiger hill garden tour office once you entered the garden. One hour approx personal guide was 100 yuan total, our pretty guide had explained really well of the ancient history of the garden and the interesting mythical stories associated with emperor's under water tomb, magical stones, wells and pagoda etc. Strolling with a guide makes the visit more interesting and entertaining. Tiger hill is not far from suzhou train station, last stop on bus route #2, approx 15 minutes."
Historical,"Beautiful and detailed garden with alot of thought, time and money put into it. Amazing to see how theres a story behind every design, room and part of the garden. Just like any part of China, full of history"
Nice garden in Suzhou,The Tiger hill are one you cant miss when you are in Suzhou.i have visit many time and you always see some new thing every time you visit here.
First visit,"Beautiful, very peaceful.  A place you should not miss visitingTake your camera and take lots of pictures!On my next visit I will come here to ""people watch"""
Nice to see some historic part of Suzhou,"Very nice park like area.Beautiful architecture, nice scenerySee the Chinese tower of Pisa, learn about history of Suzhou"
A must see in Suzhou,"Why go to Italy, you can see a leaning tower in Suzhou at Tiger Hill. The place is very big, lots of walking. If you want to see everything it can take easily 4 hours or more, depending on how fast you walk. Lots of picture taking opportunities."
"Tiger Hill, a peak above",This is the gem of Suzhou.  The ancient leaning tower sits atop a hill and is surrounded by grounds much larger than expected.  A glimpse into the past.  This was our favorite stop in Suzhou.
A beautiful park and pagoda,This was by far my favorite thing to do in Suzhou. The park area is very well kept and clean. It's a very large area so less time spent rubbing elbows with other tourists. The pagoda itself is very impressive with its very clear lean. I would highly recommend a visit to Tiger Hill if you're in Suzhou.
Beautiful even during night,"Beautiful tower and some temples are lightened up during night time. Sadly we took a tour group, which I think was waste of time and money, because they guided us at around 8-9 at night during this park. The good point the tower and the temple are very beautiful during the night. In my opinion a must see in Suzhou!"
Favorite garden that we visited,"Although a little further out of the way, we preferred this garden over some of the others in the area.  We started at the metro stop near Shantang Street and walked all the way up to Tiger Hill.  The attraction of Shantang Street is only the first kilometer of the trek; the rest was through a low-key town.Inside Tiger Hill, we payed 20 yuan each for the tram ride to the Pagoda and then walked down.  I think this was worth it and made the rest of the experience more enjoyable.  There are features in this garden that are not part of some of the others..there is a mini bamboo forest that was pretty cool, and the northern gate has some really cool ancient style buildings and architecture.  if you have time, this is worth the additional effort in getting there."
Historical Garden,Tiger Hill Pagoda as name described long name and big place.. Full of history and built in 961 A.D. cant calculate how many years old. Nice place if interested in Chinese history and if love walking..
Really nice garden - much bigger and nicer than Yu Yuan garden in Shanghai,"If you can get to Suzhou, this is a must see. Very large garden with a bended tower (yes, lize Pise in Italia). It is a large park with several pavillons. There is also an impressive bunzai garden and rock sculptures.If you are passing by Suzhou, this garden, along with the Humble adminstrator garden, should satisfy your taste for Chinese gardens.The site is a bit far from Suzhou city center and even further if you are based in the industrial park, but it is worth it and easily accessible in taxi. Fortunately taxi are still afordable in Suzhou and Shanghai. Despite that we traveled in the taxi for about 25 minutes, the price was below 100RMB. We had taken a picture of the name written in chinese of where we wanted to go, and manged to get there without difficulty. It is apparently also possible to take pubic buses to get there but for us it involved 3 connections and almost 2 hours."
Historically beautiful ,You will enter a beautiful garden with iconic Chinese design. Visitors will breathe in old China. The land mark is more than 1000 years old pagoda which is little bit tilted due to earthquake. It was a good visit.
the best tourist attraction,The hill is unlike anything we have in the west. Structures from the perimeter to the summit take you through a myriad maze of outbuildings to be welcomed at the summit with breathtaking views of surrounding SuzHou and the leaning tower a marvel in architecture deserves being a wonder of the world.
Leaning tower of China ,"The tower is second after Pisa. However, avoiding to the free guide, The sword pool is the most important, not the tower."
good one...lots of cultural beauty,we liked this place because of its uniqueness...it is a mix of garden and a historicaly important temple..it tells about the stories of various important writers and how it was named tiger hill (recommend to read when you go)....it takes about half a day to cover but time worth spent
"Fantastic park, worth a visit",Very pretty. One picturesque corner after another and one of the best parks I've seen in China.I'm not sure the English translations on some of the signs actually say what the Chinese signs say but it was fun anyway.Especially impressed by the temple! Awesome huge Buddhas and statues everywhere. The leaning tower was nice to see but can't be climbed. Also liked the Bamboo forest patch and the lake and brook. It felt quiet and I think most visitors skipped that part so we enjoyed the tranquility.
"Italy has the ""Leaning Tower of Pisa"" and China has the ""Leaning Tower of Tiger Hill""","Tiger Hill in Suzhou, China is an interesting visit.  This place gets it's name Tiger Hill because many believe it looks like a crouching tiger.  It is a popular tourist attraction but I enjoyed the beautiful gardens and walk more than the tower.  The tower itself was under renovation on my visit and it was hard to understand it's design and architectural beauty because of that.  I would still recommend visiting the site.  There is a tremendous amount of history to appreciate at the site."
"No 1 to visit, in my book","First stop of the morning, good view of the city when you reach top of the hill. Outside of tiger hill, there are boats to rent to take you thru canals. Admission was 60 yuans (about $10).the map of the park is on the backside of the ticket, in Chinese only but actual  signs are bilingual.Don't miss the Tiger Hill"
Beautiful garden with a lot of history,"Quite unexpectedly, we spent the first half of our day here. It was more retesting than we first thought. When you arrive at the front gates, there will be horse-drawn carriages and buggies offering paid rides around (and I do mean round) the place. But, do what we decided to do - walk up through the center and then come down round the outside to take in all the gardens offer. It has very interesting rockery structures, pools, cascades and of course gardens. It was serene to walk on the outer gardens - guess it is not crowded because it is winter. It would certainly be more beautiful in spring but you will likely have to contend with large crowds. Great outdoor activity with my teenaged boys."
Leaning pagoda,Probably the oldest Pagoda in China.  Precedes the first emperor.  It is leaning but not in danger of falling.  You cannot go inside but seeing is believing that about 2500 years the Chinese civil engineering was amazingly advanced.
Beautiful pagoda,We took a boat ride from Shan Tang jie to Tiger Hill. It was a 20mins boat ride. Do note that it's a one-way boat ride. You need to take a taxi or local bus back to original place. The pagoda is slightly slanted due to gravity. There are many interesting rocks along our way up to pagoda. It's a nice place for relaxing.
"1,000 years old!","The Tiger Hill Pagoda is the ""leaning tower"" of China, and at over 1,000 years of age, they are in the process of trying to save it from falling, so there are contractors on site and a bit of work going on.  The pagoda's name is Yunyan, but is more commonly known as Tiger Hill pagoda.The gardens surrounding the pagoda are gorgeous.  The Sword Pool is said to be the spot where two military generals of the ancient Wu Kingdom tested their swords. Plus, on the bridge across the pool there is a pair of well holes. As the story goes, the favorite imperial concubine, Xishi (one of the 4 beauties in ancient China), often did her make-up by looking at her water reflection at these two holes.Many families were visiting the day we were there, many with picnics.  A lovely spot!"
Get a tour guide,"There are tons of interesting stories about Tiger Hill that you will miss out on if you do not speak Chinese. Thankfully I was with a Chinese friend who was able to translate for me, which made it a much more memorable visit and worth the effort to get there."
Plenty to see and a beautiful area,"We went to Tiger Hill during the ""Chinese New Year"" holiday in 2014 and again in 2015. Each visit we discovered something new and we saw some amazing vendors that create various pieces of artwork or sketches. Any time I find my way back to Suzhou I plan to have Tiger Hill in my agenda for a stroll on a weekend day."
Asia's Leaning Tower,"Tiger Hill is a wonderful garden with lots of walking trails. Easy to navigate, but many steps if you go to the top where the tower is located. This tower, like Pisa in Italy is leaning due to erosion of the soil. Still beautiful. Lots of lovely architecturally pretty buildings throughout the walk. Lots of places to rest. Very peaceful."
Mediocre Visit,"Everyone says this is the best attraction in Suzhou, but it's really far away (long public transit ride) and costs 80 rmb for a garden which isn't that much better than gardens closer to downtown. The grounds are pretty and the pagoda is pretty, but it's not worth the time and the money. Close-by is the wedding dress street so if that is what you're looking for, then it's a great place to go. But to check out a garden? Better to stick to the Humble Administrators."
Beautiful Area,"This is a great day out if you are visiting Suzhou, it can get busy at weekends so try and go midweek if you can. There are some lovely areas to walk around and if you can't make the climb up to the pagoda there is either a horse and carriage or shuttle bus. You can take a boat ride around the lake. If you are not so hot on chinese street food then it may be best to take a picnic with you."
The leaning tower of China,"Another historical place of china, Suzhou. Garden was okay. We were there in October ....nothing much in the garden as we did explored the bonsai and really old trees. The only interesting part is the pagoda. The leaning tower as it looks like the Pisa in Italy."
Wonderful Scenery at this historical attraction,The entrance fee is CNY80 during the October period. Although a little pricey but still worth the visit for tourists with many photos taking location. The main attraction is the seven floors Yunyansi Pagoda which lean to the north to the east & has over 1000 years of history. The Bonsai gardens is also another beautiful sight. Good panoramic view of Suzhou from the top of the Tiger Hill in a chilling weather.
Tiger Hill,"This is the most expensive attraction in Suzhou but is worth the visit and another must see attraction, with many picture locations, great history and a leaning Tower though there is no access to the Tower due to the condition.The Bonsai garden and Canals are interesting to walk around or take a boat on.Allow 4-6 hrs to see the full location."
Wonderful view of the old time,"Same as all the other nice gardens in Suzhou, can really recommend a visit to all of them. Architecture is wonderful and the historical aspect give me a good feeling.But Tiger Hill is also very special, it has the leaning pagoda like Pisa in Italy, but much older. Garden has also a secret history that has not been found yet. There shall be an entrance to a secret chamber there. They expect that there is some hidden treasures there. Very to go here in the spring festival time. The garden is decorated with lots of nice flowers. So enjoy the time here.Good view of Suzhou from the top of the hill on good days with blue sky."
Peaceful,Leaning pagoda in some lovely scenery. Personally we liked the bonsai garden more than the pagoda (mainly as it is uner renovation) but i would still recommend a visit
More than just the Padoga,"The immediate downside is the scaffolding and construction to the main pagoda. However, the rest of the walk is quite nice and peaceful. I enjoyed it more than some of the other gardens. It was quite pricy though"
Well worth the visit,"Tiger Hill is one of the larger tourist gardens in Suzhou. There is a nice walk around the base of the hill, and lots of lovely features throughout. A large bonsai garden lies at the bottom of the area and you can take a walk up to the pagoda which looks a bit like the leaning tower of Piza. Unfortunately on this occasion the Pagoda was under renovation. It's a welcome retreat from the general hustle and bustle that is Suzhou and well worth a visit."
Great Stories & Marvelous Sights,Tiger hill was one of the best places to check out in Suzhou. There is a great story behind it. Lots of areas to explore as well. Must see place for tourists.
Ancient mysteries!,Tiger Hill is beautiful. It is only 36 m tall but has on top the Pagoda of the Yunyan temple. It is octagonal and 7 storeys high. and over 1000 years old. it also leans! The nearby sword pool also has an interesting history.
One of the best attractions in Suzhou,"This place is a must see place for turists that comes to Suzhou, this has a great story and a beautiful area with a lots of myths."
Shame about the scaffolding!,"This would have been a highlight of my stay in the area, however there was scaffolding obscuring all of the main structure while I was there. I'm not too sure how long the works will be ongoing for, but worth a trip once its completed!"
Fooled by our taxi driver,"We neither saw the tiger nor the hill! Our taxi driver indicated that the pagoda is under construction and then proceeded along the road and dropped us off at the entrance to a classical garden which was NOT part of Tiger Hill. We only realised that later. What we saw was the Calm Garden, quite beautiful, but with lots of tour groups and guides with loudspeakers, not even a Unesco heritage site and quite pricey at 70 RMB entrance fee. Afterwards we struggled to find the start to Shantang Street, a walk that is highly recommended in Tripadvisor reviews. Because we were in the wrong place, we had to walk through a very rundown area and lonely back roads which made us feel really uncomfortable. Apparently the silk museum is also closed for renovations and tourists are being misled to another destination where the emphasis is only on selling you silk products. Be careful!"
"Beautiful garden, easy on the knees and feet","The pagoda is under renovations, but even without the scaffolding, it's not much to see as far as ornate designs on the outside. The attraction is the beautiful grounds that weave around the hill. A great place to explore and relax. You can take an electric car around and up the hill or walk. It's not steep and takes maybe 5-10 minutes, but you can pay 20rmb if you want the electrical car or you can take a horse and carriage ride up. Either way, it's non-stressfull and beautiful."
Tiger hill is a place must visit when come to Suzhou,Second time come to Suzhou this beautiful city.  I Visit tiger hill and some new shopping area. Cycle along Jinji lake and enjoy the scenery of  food at Li gong Di.
A singular tower construction based on eggs,A very impressive historical place. Especially the tower that has been constructed without using any cement or clay but is glued together by the white of eggs centuries ago. Not to talk about fights that made it a bloody place long ago.
Disappointing as the main pagoda is under renovation now,"The main pagoda of this attraction was under renovation (covered with bamboo scaffolding) when we visited in mid-August 2015, as that was a major boo boo after taking the trouble to travel out of the city to this attraction. Stop by the tea house for a great view"
EPIC FANTASY SCENE,Pagoda at the hill is just the cherry of the amazing walkway experience with small artificial valley with rich natural and environmental scenes you could only imagine in Lord of the Rings film (without sunshine though).
Perfectly pleasant,Unfortunately the pagoda is undergoing restoration so we couldn't climb it.  A perfectly pleasant walk up to it and very interesting history
Tiger Hill pagoda,"This is a fantastic place to visit in Suzhou, The time i visited the pagoda under renovation,so cant see the whole tower, its similar the leaning tower of Pisa, the garden is good and this place is really old.There is a old beautiful Buddhist temple, and a water stream and several old Chinese writings."
must go visit,"A must go place but only if you have someone to describe the history. With the Buddhism , and communist riots, the history of nodding stones, and the deep well, which they always say has precious material in it....lol!"
Excellent. ,I recommend visiting the Tiger Hill after going into a crowded part of the city like a shopping street or the historic city. The difference from the noise and crowdedness of the city to the serene and at least less crowded garden is really astonishing. Aside from that the place is quite beautiful in itself. If you have to choose go here and not to a smaller Chinese garden.
Well worth it,"It's a nice place to spend your time. You can walk around yourself or take one of the little tour cars to take you up to the hill after which you can walk back down yourself. Beautiful gardens, only the leaning pagoda is under construction. That was a pity."
Good place to spend your time,This is good place to spend few hours. Slightly away from city. Had few hours with me and could see a sneak preview of china culture and past. Well maintained and has a few good photo spots. You can a good walk in serene nature and enjoy couple of waterfalls too.
"Atmospheric, authentic, and aesthetically pleasing","We came here based upon previous reviews. After wwiting out the rain we tokk tourist bus 1 (very convenient) to its terminus. The entrance price is 80, not 60 as I had thought, a minor disappointment. The park itself is very picturesque. It breaks off into many small components including beautifully furnished rooms, ponds, and gardens. There is plenty to see and the earlier rain allowed us to do so in relative solitude. As other reviews suggest, the pagoda is surrounded by construction work. This was a great shame but the rest of the sights just about compensated. All in all, a good place to go. Different enough from the gardens to justify visiting."
Surreal!  Such beautiful gardens... such history!,Take time to explore the many varied gardens and landscapes on this site... an experience of a lifetime!
Well worth going,"After doing the museum and the humble garden yesterday this was a breath of fresh air and I would recommend it over the other two. Really nice buildings, nice scenery and generally quite relaxing. The only negative is the main tower is still closed and covered in scaffolding but please don't let that stop you going"
Nice view,"The view is very beautiful and all surrounding are silent. I recommend you visit there at the morning in the day with the nice weather, not sunny not rainy. Also there is a small temple there."
"Nice Day out, but the Pagoda is covered in scaffolding!","I have to say that I was most looking forward to seeing the famous leaning pagoda at tiger hill, though my first view after purchasing my ticket was of the pagoda on its rocky hill, surrounded by scaffolding!The rest of the scenic area is still a nice wander, seeing thousand peoples rock, and the sword rock, some nice views of the city and hills to the west.Also went on an individually run boat ride where we paid at the little shop to the left after crossing the bridge at the south entrance gates - It took us around the river that surrounds tiger hill in a circuit. This was great value for money and better than any 'tourist' boat you will get anywhere! Note: the price on their board was for 1 boat not per person"
Interesting!,"I really liked the Spring of Simplicity and Honesty, which is a well that first appeared as a spring to an exhausted monk carrying water up the entire length of the hill. The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds of years. There are evidence of this from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill."
View is nice.,Tiger Hill is one of the better spots in Suzhou. The view is nice but a bit hazy due to the pollution.
Decent garden with an interesting building in the middle,"The garden itself is nothing special compared to the other offerings around Suzhou.The pagoda at the top is really a sight, though.  Hard to understand how buildings that big can lean so much and stay upright."
Tiger Hill,"the mo.st amazing place in Suzhou.  the tower is slightly leaning and is a wonderful sight.The best part here are the fruit vendors, selling different varities of local stuff.Do try them. there  is a small market as you enter with lot of stuff for sale including food stalls"
"Love the Garden, love the Pagoda, but ...","Following the footsteps of my father who climbed up the Tiger Hill over six decades ago, I pilgrimaged to the sacred place in my heart. It's easy to get there by almost any bus stop at Quanqianjie North within 25 minutes.With the crowds moving forward, I saw huge rocks and the ""Jian-chi,"" or Sword Pond. At this historical place, several of the most notable ancient Chinese poets and calligraphers had their words carved on the rocks over the past twenty thousand years. The time of centuries of wars and fire all froze on the rocks. Su Dongpo, the Chinese poet in Tang Dynasty once said ""It would be a great pity not to see Tiger Hill when visiting Suzhou."" There I was! Moreover, this place has more to offer to visitors besides the Pagoda and the Sword Pond and the legends telling about their history. Trails by the hill and pavilions scattered on its top.Passing the rocks and in no time I knew I was approaching the Pagoda. However, to my utmost disappointment, it was under construction. There was no way to take a photo with it, not to even mention the possibility of getting into it."
Pagoda in renovation... Beaware,"3rd day @ Suzhou. Pax: 3, taking Bus Ê∏∏ 2 - RMB 2 each from Suzhou MuseumTicket - RMB 60, Cart - RMB 20, Tourist guide - RMB 80, Boat - RMB 50, to go Â±±Â°òË°óWe engaged a tourist guide at the entrance there. Without knowing the full story background, we found that we can't really enjoy and appreciate every part of the garden. That day is a rainy day and very little people come. We are told that the china kids are sitting their exam.The pagoda at that time is under reinforcement to avoid the bending of its structure. It is a waste that we can't meet the ""Pisa"" in the east. Tour guide told us they only perform the repair every 20 yrs. We are such lucky.Tips: Always try bargain with the tourist guide rate. We took bus 307 to go back Hotel Soul Suzhou.Call to find out the completion date of the construction, if u really want to visit them."
One of the largest gardens,"This is one of the largest and most relaxing historical gardens in Suzhou. Enjoy walking around and going up and down through the various ""rooms"". The spring is a must see. Currently the pagoda is under conservation repair."
Lovely trip,"The complex of the hill is so beautiful, vast and full of interesting things. The pagoda is eye catching while the garden is very nice. Loved this place."
Great place,Sorry the pagoda was wreathed in scaffolding.The bonsai garden is superb - absolutely a must see. The trees are well cared for and beautifully presented.
Visit to tiger hill,visited Tiger hill from Shanghai as a day visit to Suzhou in our 10 day trip in China. It is not really a hill. You can go closer to the attraction by bus. Then walk . nice with flowers of different varieties. Best season to visit is April - May. during the period place is pretty crowded. When we go there this April The leaning Pagoda was under repair and couldn't see well. Nice to go
Nice visiting spot,"Even the famous tower was blocked due to remodeling, it was a great place with thousands of stories. But do not want to visit the public toilets!"
Was being restored,We could not see anything because there was a restoration going on and we wasted time to go there. So travellers going there in the coming months check if restoration is finished.
Suzhou highlight,"From the moment we arrived at Tiger Hill we were impressed and after our escorted tour of China's highlights we both felt this was the best garden we visited.  When you arrive you first come across a waterfall and the gardens throughout are beautiful and well tended.  We particularly enjoyed the bonsai trees and the tulips and other spring flowers.  In terms of highlights the main hall was pretty amazing with the Buddhas, the Sword Pool and the Pagoda.  Sadly the Pagoda was surrounded by scaffolding as it is currently being restored - this was the only slight disappointment of our visit."
Must-see for Suzhou travel - Tiger Hill,"After lunch and a short rest, we took the bus Y1 to visit Tiger Hill. The entrance fee is now 80RMB. The impressive attractions on the hill is Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple and Sword Pool. Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple, also known as Tiger Hill Pagoda, is seen as the leaning tower in China. According to the historical legend, Sword Pool is said to bury about 1000 precious swords. It is worth time and money to visit Tiger Hill. The tour guide give very detailed and interesting explanation and we learned a lot about the history of hill and some other customs of Suzhou."
Fun with Kids,"A great half day tour for adults and kids alike.Walking around the Pagoda,tree's and a short boat ride.Small food halls,horse and cart rides etc."
impressive,"Unfortunately the tower had been bamboo scaffolded and there was no admittance to go inside.The tower is pending, just similar to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It is a great place to stroll and enjoy for half a day - better go early in the morning because it will be crowded in the afternoons.From the terraces you enjoy a beautiful view over the city of Suzhou."
The pagoda was undergoing maintenance! :(,"Tiger Hill is really huge! Of course the greatest disappointment is that the iconic pagoda was undergoing maintenance when we were there. Hence, we took a walk in the other parts of the park. The greenery was very lush, and sets my mind in peace...this place is a rare gem that many others wouldnt have discovered if they continue to embark on popular destinations like Korea or Taiwan.China has the greenest trees, no doubt. The Tiger Hill destination also leads to a really huge nice chinese garden, filled with water lilies and beautiful sights."
Go early in the morning to experience peace and quiet.,"We entered via the north gate which is quieter. It is possible to take a boat ride on a circular route arounf the island the pagoda stands on. having looked at the map we decided to go all the way round and then walk in and exit via the south gate.It got busy very quickly.Unfortunatley the pagoda was covered from top to bottom with scaffolding so it was difficult to see the ""lean"" which it is famous for.The toilets at the south gate are awful."
Great place to stroll and enjoy,"Tiger Hill is large and comfortable with history, gardens and a big ol' pagoda that unfortunately was encased in bamboo scaffolding.  Not to worry.  There is a nice tea house near the top, cafe's at the bottom, great views of Suzhou, and a colony of egrets threatening to poop all over the unwary.  We spent 4 beautiful hours there, then a couple of more at the nearby Suzhou museum.  Really a very nice day getting to know the culture and seeing the people.  There were some small boats on the canal, but not sure if you can ride in them."
Deserving of its UNESCO site status,"I went here with my tour groupTiger hill can be describe as a collection of major and minor historical landmarks.These landmarks would be undecipherable without the help of a guide.We walk through the site with a guide and we feast on the historical stories of the various landmarks.The tiger hill has a developed area and and a natural area, both provide good opportunities to take photos"
Very scenic,"Visit it, and you will not be disappointed. Early in the morning, still quiet and not crowded. Take a look at the Pagoda, enjoy the lakes, river, paths, grass, trees, flowers. Find a peace within yourself."
Serenity in another way,"Great forested hill with bamboo and other assorted trees. If you like to stroll in a forested area, Tiger hill is a place you should not missed if you visit Suzhou. There's also a Pagoda that is historical and there are more to see !"
"Ancient Burial Site of the Emporer, with Amazing History","It takes 30 mins out of the city and our guide (QuinQuin booked through Trip advisor) brought us here, as my husband had a list of places that he believed we would be most interested and she confirmed that they were of merit.  We visited the Humble Administrators Garden first about 10 minutes away in this ancient city.  As you walk through there are vendors and then you walk up this ancient cobbled path that is just as you hope it will be, lined with hundred of flowers, tulips surprisingly amid other plants, vibrant and well kept..  You walk through an arch with two statues of ancient warrior who protect the monument and into the great cobbled area, up each one of the huge wide step, past monuments to maiden with sad histories, a wonderful shop that sell old fashioned souvenirs not to be missed at old fashioned prices, statues and onto the monument and the death of the 1000 peasants who made the monument for the Emporer and the burial under the moat.  Carry on walking to the top to Tiger Hill and the Pagoda of fantastic proportions built when it seemed impossible to managed this and into a museum of about the heritage of the pagoda and its history.  Gently wander along to an amazing view and panorama and then down the other side of the hill and to the Buddha's and then to the Bonsai Gardens.  Really quite wonderful.. If you would like to there are horse and carriage rides that take you from one side of the monument to the other.....  This was fabulous, and wear your walking shoes!"
if you have time to linger and look and you know what you are looking at.,"our group had a guide, so it all made sense.  very historic site. very interesting and scenic . I enjoyed our stop here. and would read up on the story a bit more to understand the importance of it ."
Erin interesting couple of hours stop off,"We stopped in here on the way to Suzhou City (for business). Very relaxing and interesting location and worth the stop. We had the benefit of a local guide with us who was able to fill in the gaps for English speaking tourists, but I would suggest even without this, it would have been a picturesque (albeit slightly confusing) place to visit."
With the Leaning Pagoda swathed in scaffolding and closed there is no real purpose to visiting!,"It was the afternoon of our last day in Suzhou, and after an enjoyable morning at the Pan Men scenic area in the south of the city we had time left for one more ""attraction"" in the city so decided to visit Tiger Hill. Until the Pagoda of the Rock is reopened , unless you really love massed potted plants don't bother with this one!"
Quite a place,"We had a long climb to get up to the pagoda on top of the hill; but it was worth it.  When we came to the pagoda, there was scaffolding on it.  The entire structure is masonry and designed to imitate wood construction.  The pagoda weighs 15,000,000 pounds.  It did appear to need some renovation.  But then again, it is the original construction from the year 907AD.  Concrete was pumped under the pagoda in 1957 to help stop further leaning. I had thought that the reason we had climbed the hill was to see the pagoda; but the real reason seemed to be to see the lovely grounds.  It was especially nice that the plum blossoms were blooming there.There was a deep chasm not far from the pagoda.  It was covered with ferns and moss.  It is known as the Sword Pond, a small rectangular pond, beneath which a treasure of some 3000 swords are believed to have been buried.  They have not excavated the site because the leaning pagoda's foundations rest on it.It was a shame that we visited on a cloudy day, since it is a gorgeous place."
"Well, it's ok","The Tiger Hill has a lot of significance to the Chinese crowds, but not so much to all of the foreign tourists. The best spot is of course the Leaning Pagoda, the oldest leaning tower in the world. I would give it a second go, only if I had no other things to do in Suzhou. It is wrth going there during the Flower Festival, which is in April, I think. There are lots of beautiful flower arrangments across the whole area."
Quite a big place with an interesting story,Tiger hill has not tiger but it's a nice place to go. Story has it that there are swords being hidden in the lake and there was even a sword that was crafted to cut through a stone and there is even a stone there as prove. Not sure if it's true but it does sound incredible.Got quite a lot of places to walk so take it time and enjoy the scenery.
Beautiful landscaping & worth spending a couple of hours,"The complex looks deceptively small when you enter. We went over a weekend  morning & it was not very crowded. Could be because the main pagoda is still under repair & surrounded by scaffolding mostly. You can climb the stairs up straight to the pagoda or take a slower meandering but more scenic walk along the foliage. Parts of the hill had potted tulips in bloom making for a lovely back drop for pictures. There is not much to eat & drink except small stall selling the standard wares like bottled water, ice-cream etc so if you would like to have a picnic here, you need to being your own food. There are a couple of Buddhist prayer halls inside the complex as well worth a visit. The landscaping has been done well giving you a varied experience of tea plantations, bamboo forest, thick under foliage interspersed with blossoms in parts. Definitely worth a visit. Not a stroller friendly place (if travelling with kids)"
