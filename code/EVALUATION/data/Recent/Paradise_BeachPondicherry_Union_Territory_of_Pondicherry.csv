Paradise Beach,"Paradise beach is a beautiful and clean beach in pondy.. can enjoy with friends, family, couples etc..there are alot of activities also available.."
Serene Clean Beach,"This beach is located to south of Pondicherry and remains one of the must visit places in the area. The beach is clean, serene and offers nice views during sunrise and sunset. There are few vendors who sell some food items etc."
Heaven - Chunnambar Boat House ,"The beach is absolutely fantastic and it is the best in Puducherry considering the beauty. Very shallow, safe for kids and well maintained. It's very clean. You can take bath in the sea.Free rooms are available for changing the dress, restaurant and refreshment stores were also available where you can take rest and have delicious seafood but quite expensive. Usually not overly crowdy and the beach is very calm and the ambience is quite nice for a family or young couple who loves some peace. One shouldn't miss an opportunity to visit this beach and wet your feet.You have to take a boat ride of around 10 minutes to visit the main beach. So you can enjoy the beautiful backwater. The motor boat charged ‚Çπ300 for the trip. There are speedboats as well, which charge max ‚Çπ1800. The closing time is around 6pm.It's an amazing place to spend an entire day."
Good,This place is spectacular and is a must visit for all the beach lovers and I will also recommend people to wear comfortable footwear
Nice clean place ,"It was a sudden plan for me to visit the place . But surely world not regret going . The cottage is quite reasonable as u have visited a few place here and hence accordingly. it is the cheapest and along side the best . Nice clean place , spacious rooms , and delicious quality food. The crowd is amazing , especially on weekends. I must visit place if you are in Udup."
Paradise Beach,Paradise Beach is a beautiful beach and one must enjoy the scenic beauty of this awesome place to the fullest.
A nice place and a nice outdoor activity while in Puducherry,"Paradise beach involves around 30 mins of boating to reach from the Boat Club. It's a secluded clean beach area where one can have many fun activities. The boating experience is also a good one. Speed boats are also available, to add the thrill element."
Average beach,Its just the boat ride to the beach apart from that nothing great.On weekend it becomes super crowded and dirty too.

Great Pondi Beach,"visit the Le Pondy resort for a Coffee or evening chilled Beer on the beach, their cafe is on the pool side and the ambience Le Pondy is unmatchable, i would suggest a 2 night stay at this resort."
 Clean !,Awesome beach ! So far it is well maintained by the people .Hope it stays clean.Very relaxing and safe. All ladies nothing to worry it's safe. Must vist Beach. Thanks to Puducherry to have such a wonderful beach. Good hang outs nearby for food and stay. Do not miss it . Do visit!
Superb Beach,"Great place to spend a few hour, nice white soft sand and clean water. You can splash around in the shallow water, not allowed to go in deep water. Lots of life guards around. There are two restaurants with average tasting slightly pricey food."
The Best Beach ,"Hands down, the most beautiful beach in the state. It's a bit far from the city but it's worth it. All the water activities take place here and you can get some gorgeous sunset views. Boat rides through the palm trees, walking along the beach, chilling in shacks, definitely the best."
prestine and amazing beach,we visited this beach on 27 feb 20.surprisingly there was no queue for boat tickets we got in boat within five minutes.beach is very scenic and boatride of 20 minutes was most enjoyable beach isvery quite and authorities have thoughtfully constructed many huts on the beach from there visitors can enjoy the experience comfortably under shade.return journey was also quick and boat passing through two island is awesome.this veach can be compared with few nice beaches of bali and maldives must visit when you visit pudducherry
A clean and nice sand beach,"Visited this place with family and very much liked it for it's cleaniness and scenery. One can reach the beach using the boat ride 15 min, from boathouse. They have two ticket counter, one for entry and parking ticket and other one inside is for boat ticket, charges 354 per adult. Counter opens at 9:30, which is a problem as you miss the morning time at the beach. It's a must visit place in Pondicherry if you are a beach lover."
Ordinary beach but still better than others in Pondi,"If you have been to Goa and saw many beaches then this place will not excite you but in pondi it is the one clean & nice beach. It is far from main city 8 kms and there is entry fee of 350 approx per head in which they will take you to beach through boat and you can spend time , take bath & click pics on beach.  Else there is 2 option to choose fairy and take ride only and it is cheaper than 1 option. They have maintained it nicley and made huts to relax there."
Loved it,You can just visit the paradise beach but boat ride or you can stay their. We opted the second option and that was a wise decision. It's a nearly virgin beach with blue water. Very scenic.
Ordinary beach but trip over was nice ,"Windy beach that's not that nice , nothing there but a restaurant. The trip over was probably the best part ."
Anniversary ‚ù§Ô∏è Trip,Nice peaceful BeachHorse ride was the USPBoat ride was goodLess commercializedClicked lots of PhotographsShacks missing
Nice...,"This place is nice for picnic. I went with my friends. The place is very clean. You also gets to do various activities like horse ridding, quad biking, etc..."
The beach with changing color of sky and water is an ultimate as the time progresses in the day.,"One of the coolest and cleanest beaches I've ever been!!! I loved this paradise Beach because of its environment and cleanliness. There is a small restaurant available which serves sea food fast food cold drinks etc., even coconut water is also available at stalls. I tried prawns and other fishes there which was too much yummy üòã. Also they have washrooms too for changing and refreshing One can have an excellent experience of beach. it takes a travel from boat house to beach.. The beach with changing color of sky and water is an ultimate as the time progresses in the day. . I would totally suggest this paradise Beach for having a good time!"
Cleanest and best beach in Pondicherry .. must visit,"This is the cleanest beach in Pondicherry. Reaching this place is a bit of pain, because you have to take a ferry ride for which during tourist season you may have to stand in queues for upto one hour both for getting to the beach and then getting out of there. The cost of ferry ride is Rs. 300 per person and it takes about 15 minutes to get to the beach in ferry, after the one hour queue. I saw someone write that he took only 120 seconds to reach the ferry in the queue. I will ask people not to trust that review as this person may have visited in summer heat when no one wants to sit on the beach. We did not explore the road route to the beach, but if someone wants to, it is well worth it given that you will save time and enjoy more of the beach. If you are in Pondicherry, Paradise Beach is a must visit place and may even be the highlight of your tour if you manage to spend enough time at this place.Definitely the best attraction in Pondicherry."
Lovely afternoon walk,We had a day to spend in Pondicherry and we took the ferry to the beach. A delight to walk with a lovely weather. The ferry which took us there was nice clean with life jackets provided. The place a lot of activities but we just choose to walk on the beach which was itself a splendid experience clean beach..
Loved being to Paradise Beach,One of the cleanest beach in India. Very well maintained. Its one of the roughest beach and swimming is prohibited. You should take the boat ride to visit to this place. Dont go via Car as its not accessible via road.
Really worth it,"I went for a while to paradise beach, the view and the place are worth the waiting time for the ships. I like the effort to maintain it clean, in comparison to other places it¬¥s a very clean one. Keep doing the good job and as visitors, we should also help with that =) The colors of sand and sea are a very nice mix."
One of India's best Beach Minus Liquor ,"The most astonishing thing that I read about this beach in Terrible/Poor reviews of Trip Advisor was that this beach is dirty and small. I seriously do not know which planet those guys had visited to see a beach cleaner than this beach. I have been to beaches of Bali, Maldives, Goa etc which have beaches known to be some of the best in the world but to my surprise Paradise beach quite comfortably beats all those beaches when it comes to Cleanliness. I don't say that this beach is better than those beaches but it is certainly cleaner which is the first criteria you rate a beach on. How to reach- You need to reach Chunambar boathouse to take a boat.Tickets - INR 55 Car Parking outside the entrance of premises of boathouse INR 300/person for Boat to Paradise (Inside) Beach on Normal Motor Boat carrying 25 personsINR 1800/couple on speed boat for 2.I would still prefer normal ferry not because it's economical but because it's a slow, smooth and extremely comfortable ride and would allow you to reach the beach in less than 15 minutes. Time to take ticket - I reached the counter at 10:30 in the morning on a Saturday and it took bit more than 120 seconds to buy a boat ticket. This is where I was worried as some of the terrible reviews read 1.5 hours for ticket and huge line which I feel is completely wrong or situations with those guys might have been different.Turn Ons - Cleanliness, Well behaved Staff,   Very Good Crowd Mostly Educated, Decent Restaurants not expensive at all, serves both veg and Non veg food with good quality. Turn Offs - No Beer, No Liquor Allowed or served."
Most beautiful clean beach,"Paradise beach is very accessible from Pondicherry. The most comfortable way to reach the beach is by boat from Chunnambar Boathouse. It is beautiful well-maintained beach with changing/showering facilities. It also has a rain dance setup with music. Advice to take food, water and towels. It is advisable to return back before 5.30pm as boat operations ceases by then."
Nice place to visit in the Evening with Kids,I had spent very short time in the Sunday evening while returning to Chennai. Nice to walk and play with kids. Beach are clean.
The Only Clean Beach in Pondy! ,This was the only clean beach we found in the entire Pondicherry. Rest of the beaches are full of trash and are not safe to take a dip! Loved the views and the peaceful environment! ‚ù§Ô∏èTruly a paradise!
Superb Long Beach front in Pondy ,Don‚Äôt go there by the boat - take the road to the paradise beach - saves you time and money and gives you access to a long nice clean beach to enjoy - the road maybe a bit tricky - google takes you to some weird place but then the guards will guide you to the proper entrance to the beachExcellent Clean place to take a stroll and enjoy the views
Clean and secluded ,"A clean and secluded beach is difficult to find these days, but here is Paradise beach, just half an hours drive from the French quarter in Pondicherry. You can reach it either by ferry, or by road. Most people use the ferry to go there. We went by road, so that we were not committed to catch the last ferry back to the mainland. The approach by road is through a single lanes road going through villages, and as you reach the beach there a I wiil talk to you reach the beach there are a few kiosks for maggi, fried fish, cold drinks etc. We spent a couple of hours there, and had most part of the beach to ourselves.  It could do with a few amenities like a proper restaurant and beach chairs. In case you plan to go with friends/ family it would be better you carry your own mats/ food etc with you."
Just like any other beach,"As the title says, it is just like any other normal beach. You have to walk a-lot to reach this beach. The road to the beach is not so obvious.The local-boat owners & auto-rickshaw drivers have their respective unions who do not really let you enjoy your time by bugging you every now & then.The boat-unionists do not allow you on an adjacent beach, if you've not come by a boat (or ask for a random entry fees,) andThe auto/cab-drivers won't let you park at a good spot.Try not to eat local food, I felt it wasn't hygienic."
"Clean, well maintained but do not expect Goa","There is a nice, welcoming arch when you enter the beach & the crowd is decent, the sands are clean, the waters were calm, there were no hawkers on the beach - overall doable if in Pondicherry for an extra day.One point to note - we did not enter the beach using the ferry so we may not have landed in the prime area which seems far busier from the pictures other reviewers have posted."
One of the must visit place in pondicherry,Getting to promenade beach requires two tickets. One for the park entry and the other one is for the ferry / speed boat which takes to the paradise island/beach.The cost for ferry is 300 per person and is like general class.Speed boat is 6000 for 8+1 seater.There is an in house restaurant in the park and in the island too.The beach is very clean and suitable for swimming and taking bath.
Please boycutt the paradise beach.,"I just visited there on 1st of January, 2020. Beach is very good but you can visit just a small part of the beach.. now you will thinking what happened with the other part. So i am telling you that most of the part of the beach is sold to private resorts or hotels. One suggestion to government please sale all the part to the resorts owner. Thanks."
Paradise beach,"Beautiful beache to enjoy with family, but don't forget to take umbrella during noon time. It's advisable to visit in morning or in evening times take some snacks for more entertainment."
Good beach but under-utilized,A picturesque beach. Very clean and well maintained. Can be accessed by boat ride from Chunambur boat house. However the beach has very limited access area. Limited fast food stalls. It has shower facility and hence don't forget to take your bathing suits.
Very clean beach,"It is small island near coromandal cost of Pondicherry approx 10 km from townVery good  children activities like rain dance , horse riding variety of games to chill out in the evening infact full day is required. For relaxation & sea activities, sea foods, cool breez & fun to enjoy"
Wonderful,It was wonderful and good experience. Enjoyed a lot. Clicked many pics as to that has good boards and signs. Perfect place.
"Superb and Funtastic place to relax, refresh and bath in sea water.","Superb and Funtastic place to relax, refresh and bath in sea water. This beach is in the island and to reach this beach island Pondicherry government arranges boating. Also the hotel Sea Gulls found in the island are maintained by Pondicherry government. All found are prepared fresh and served with great taste."
Short trip with kids,"It was a long auto ride and then a ferry to reach Paradise Beach. Unfortunately swimming was not allowed so not much time to spend just watching the sand and waves, although we found some local kids making a splash. There are toilets and changing rooms that are reasonably clean.The sand is soft and ideal for a beach. Unfortunately for us it wasn‚Äôt quite worth the trip as no activities besides dipping your feet in water or enjoying a horse ride under the scorching sun."
One of the cleanest beach in India,"This is one of the most scenic and clean beaches that I've been to. I couldn't resist myself from bathing in the sea here, something which I generally don't do.Visited here with family, this has to be one of the must visit places in pondicherry in your schedule."
Cool place to visit,"Its a fantastic place with all Amenities such as shower, washroom readily available free of cost.The scenery is amazing. Kids liked horse riding and vehicle ride available.The beach is quite clean."
"Nice, Clean Beach","Clean, well maintained beach with lifeguards. Good place to wet feet and spend time. The beach is reachable using a boat from Chunnambar boat house. Boats drop and pick up at regular intervals. The beach has toilets and a shower too."
Clean beach but badly managed,The beach is as it name suggests. Bad part as you can imagine government controlled. Long queues for tickets. There is one ticket counter to enter the boat house and another ticket counter in the boat house for the ferry ride to beach. This could be merged into one. The beach itself is small and there are many life guards who blow whistle as soon as you step into the water. They literally cleared the beach 2 hours before high tide so my kids fun in the beach got curtailed to around 10 mins. These life guards are just killjoy people. Later... After playing in the shallow water were cleared of that too. Then headed for the rain shower area which had stopped so then headed for shower area to rinse the sand off. Lo and behold no water. No one around to address the issue. Its 300 per  person to use the beach and ferry but clearly India is a long way behind when it looks to give top rated tourist satisfaction. There is no food or snack stalls on paradise beach. I guess this is because they dont want any litter but tourist litter still has to be cleared anyways. There was only a solo coconut vendor selling at 50 Rs which is double the city prices.
Very beautiful beach,"Awesome beach, very clean, white sand, not very crowded and you can enjoy it to your own.I would rate it better than Goa beaches anytime. Need to be careful as sea is really wild here."
Good,Nice place to hang around it‚Äôs like an island where you have to go by boot . Just remind it it‚Äôs non alcoholic place .
Awesone beach like island ,"Awesone beach like island .. Must visit place.. This beach is so clean and having lot of fun like rain dance, beach volleyball ball, throw balls... Set up is good.. To reach this beach we need start ride around 20mins"
Clean Paradise Beach,"Paradise beach can be assessed by road and by boat. It is a continuous stretch of beach of about 2.5 Km. The beach is clean and besides the area near the Jetty, it is not crowded.There are numerous food stalls selling sea food along the beach. Their quality, source of water and hygiene is highly suspect.Next to the parking, the locals have provided showers and toilets for a meagre fee. I grade this beach higher than a majority of beaches in Goa."
Calm & peaceful !,clean is the mantra here.. a relaxing soothing place away from the hustle of the town.. the cleanliness assistants here strike a cord & they do the job well..also noticed a few cabins along the shore..
Paradise beach-clean beach,Nice place to spend time. This is a clean beach. Can play in water n has shacks serving decent food. You can also njoy water activities here. There is a change room which is a good thing.
Beautiful ,It‚Äôs beautiful government can commercial this a by building more hotels .Loved the place . If you can‚Äôt visit Goa u can visit Pondicherry
Awesome Beach,"This is one of the most beautiful beach i have ever been in India. It is neat, clean, less crowded. It is very nice experience to go in boat to reach this beach. Only think what i felt is on the Government fare of Rs300 for boat which is very high."
Wonderful Place,IT s a wonderful place to visit. White sand and the calmness of the beach is quitesome. Make sure when you visit pondy drop in a visit.
may be over-rated,"water is deep and usually not allowed to go into water, especially after 4pm. Sand is nice and clean. Except that it is a normal beach with no extra features to mention. A fee of INR 300 is okay to avoid unnecessary rush. Food is below average and no alcohol allowed. The boat ride is average, not much lanscapes to be seen."
Tiny island,"A small island,little far from the ECR beach road .Can go inside by boats of local boating service. A pleasant experience can be felt over there."
Disappointed by the visit,"A much hyped up place. Yes, the beach is lovely, sand is really soft, but the rough sea and over enthusiastic lifeguards keeping you out of the water are a big let down.On top of it an overpriced ferry ride costing Rs. 300/- per person is definitely not worth it. Best to avoid and visit Serenity or Auroville beaches."
See blazes,"What a view of all the things , simply amazing ‚õµ riding and every thind is fantastic, coconut trees are amazablles"
Avoid visiting this place on holidays,During my trip to Pondy I visited this place on Sunday. The place is over crowded and at one point management decided to close the entry as they were not able to controll the crowd. I recommend to visit place during non-holidays time. Otherwise try to visit place in the morning.
Isolated Peaceful Beach with Golden Sand!,"This is a beautiful beach on an isolated island, about 8 km from Pondicherry town. Approached by ferry from the Chunnambar boat house, the beach provides excellent group activity. Golden smooth sand is inviting for a rejuvenating walk in the cold sea water along the shallow sea shore. Good facility of bath rooms and wash rooms also exist, that is useful after swimming in salt water. Scattered huts for resting, and a seller of fresh tender coconut water are respite in the prickly heat reflected by sand. A lonely restaurant on the beach is not much of a help with its limited supplies and over-dependence on state electricity, which was cut off at that time and we didn‚Äôt get tea or coffee even! No doubt school children get here exciting activity, a solitary thinker sitting in a remotely located hut will also find equal bliss staring at the waves of the ocean!"
Lovely beach,"A 20 minute boat ride takes you to this wonderful beach. It‚Äôs clean, the sand is soft and golden and the sea is awesome. Plenty of lifeguards around for the adventurous. If one is not a good swimmer it is better to get drenched near the shore. Go in the morning and enjoy the day. Don‚Äôt forget to catch the last boat back at 6 pm."
Paradise Beach is so beautiful,Paradise Beach is superb beautiful with white sand and beautiful huts. It's very scielent and find very few people around here. The tides are very high and people are not supposed to swim. ** Swimming here is too risky and not allowed.
Pretty beach ,"You need to pay Rs300 per pax to take a ferry there. They seem to have very little visitors on the Wednesday afternoon we went. It can get very hot. No female really a wears bathing suits. No Swimming in too deep into the waters, the lifeguard will literally blow his top off. Few food options. They do a bag check before you board the ferry to prevent you from bringing outside food in. There are stray dogs on the beach. If you eat, they‚Äôll beg. There are crows too."
Superb ,This is one of the cleanest beach in Pondy and must visit. You will have to taken an entry ticket and then need to take ticket for 6 km boat ride to take you to the beach. There are various options like regular motor boat which costs around 300 per person (2 way) and speed boat rides ranging from 2500 to 6000 based on the seating. Beach is very nice and clean.. There are some shops where you can get snacks.. this is a must visit spot when in Pondy..
Must visit ,You need to hire a boat to reach the beach. It cost you around 300 rs pp for indian citizens. It is worth paying as beach is relatively unexplored and clean. Try to go after 3pm to avoid excessive heat. The restaurant on the beach was ok better to take food with you.. The paradise beach water was clean and you can enjoy it. Shower area and changing rooms available on the beach..
Not for everybody,"It is an island accessed by boat. Takes around 8-10 minutes by boat to reach the same. Boats are operated by the Government Tourism department. The island is sandy, clean and bereft of vendors and beggars. There are two kiosks and food joints permitted by the State. It has got few water sports facilities. It is very sunny and has few huts to shade you. Many dogs roaming around. Good for youngsters who love the beach and sun."
Clean beach,This beach is one of the cleanest you can see in India.The footpath on the beach is about half a kilometre . Definitely have a walk in the evening to experience nature .Avoid rainy season in puducherry
Truly a Paradise!!!,"Truly the best beach I have been to in my travelling life so far. My family, specially my kid absolutely loved it. The beach is spotlessly clean and consists of hut like shacks, which proved useful for us during a rain spell.To reach this beach, hop on a rick and come to the Chunnambar boat house. The entry fee is reasonable however, the Ferry ride from boat house till beach is expensive at 300 rs/head.The half hour Ferry ride is enjoyable.This beach is a must visit."
Clean and white sand beach,"You need to reach this beach by taking a boat ride from Chunambar boat house. 20 mins one way trip. You can't go much deeper and sea shore is shallow, but can get wet. Beach is scenic due to its cleanliness and white sand."
Dirty beach,"Very dirty. Though sand of this beach is soft but the beach itself was dirty, full of plastics, algae beer bottles etc."
Bit remote but quite clean,"This beach is situated away from the city but can be easily accessed by bicycle or on hire two wheeler. One can also rent an auto to reach the place but that can be expensive affair. Anyway,you have to take boat trip as well. Beach is pretty clean and one can  also try for activities like scuba diving over here."
Well maintained Beach with Beach Lifeguards,One has to take Boat ride from Chunnambar Boat house. Google map shows 3 points for Paradise beach. Make sure you reach to Chunnambar boat house from where take a boat ride to reach the paradise beach. Its well maintained by authorities. Beach Life guards patrol the beach. Except the boating and swimming i dont see any other activities in the beach.
Meh,Nothing much to do except siting on a bench or sunbathing.  The pluss is that it is remote. They have a cafe but it gave me the creeps and i went away very fast.
One of the Cleanest beach in India ,This is the one of the cleanest beach in India. The way to go to this beach is through a boat in backwaters. With a charge of Rs 300 per person.
Awesome beach !!!,This is one of the best beach in south India . Neat and clean . We need to take a boat ride to reach this place . Ample parking space is available at the boat jetty . We visited on week day so there wasnt much rush . Also there are beautiful parasols made of coconut leaves are there for the visitors to sit and relax in the sun .
Paradise Beach with boat ride,"Worth the time and effort. Boat ride costs 300 per person. If taking a speedboat, rates are different and higher. Very picturesque and conveniently located with enough car parking. Closes at 6pm."
Paradise- Its different,"The most visited beach in Pondy, its called Paradise. But, if you are thinking that this is really a happening beach like that in Goa, you will be disappointed. It's calm, serene and the access is through a 20 mins boat ride. The last ride from the back to the mainland is at 5:30 PM so, it kind of closes by night.An adult 2-way ticket is Rs 300, kids below 10 are charged Rs 150. The boathouse can be crowded sometimes, so plan for 30 mins to 1 hour to get in. Boats have life jackets, but no one really instructs you to wear so, some people wear some don't!! After a 20 mins ride, you land at the Paradise beach. There is nothing much apart from a few shaded tents, a coconut vendor and a small shack like thing. The beach is calm and wide. It can be really hot, so carry water bottles. There are no drinks, food etc available on the island and alcohol is restricted.Overall, Paradise is good for some Instagram shots, nothing more than that."
Par√†dise beach,Nice place to spend time.boating and bathing in Sea.Good place to enjoy with big family members.Afternnon time it was hot.but many resting places huts available.excellent picnic spot available in pondicherry
Nice Beach but crowded,"The beach can be accessed via motorboat ride from Chunnambar Boat House. It's a 15 mins boat ride. The beach is vast and beautiful, and has some activities Rain Dance, or huts to relax. There's an okayish restaurant too."
Clean beach,"It is away from the city. it is a nice place to relax. Not many vendors, which is good if you dont like a lot of hustle and bustle."
Very good beach,"Its very good beach with one of the best location in Pondy. Very quite place for outing. You have to travel via boat to get there. Take your own food there, not very good restaurants are present in this beach."
Good clean beach,"It's a good clean beach but I didn't find any clean water place to take bath after,please search that and then go inside."
Nice beach,Nice beach and very beautiful seen ever and enjoying your family and friends and family and friends and loving memory
Good Place but requires lot of improvements,"Good location, calm place for weekend outing. Boating was good. It would have been better if the following are avaliable.1. More cleaner.2. Good Hotels.3. More fun games and attractions for childrens."
Beach visit ,"One of the Beautiful beaches of India . Beach is neat & clean , colour of the water is blue . Place to hang out with family & friends."
Very good place ,"Beautiful neat and clean beach, going there in speed boat was nice experience. It would be better if they provide some food items there so that we can spend more time over there"
Island beach..,"A boat ride, either a speed boat or a normal motor boat, of 30 minutes take you from the boat station to this island beach.We visited at 12 noon and was very hot. Must be good in the evenings.There are many shaded places with benches provided for relaxing. Bath room and toilet facilities are available for sea bathers.A must visit attraction of Pondicherry üòäGanesh J"
Picture perfect,Earliest boat to Paradise beach leaves at around 9  and it's a beautiful boat ride up to the beach. It takes about 30 mins and you are at Paradise! One of the cleanest beaches in India and I hope it will remain a clean with a little effort from everyone who visits. It's not too crowded in the morning but it could do with a few more shade shacks and dry changing areas. Boat rides to and fro area available every half hour.
Energy overflowing here,"In early September 2019, I went to Paradise beach, where I took a boat from the back waters to the beach. There is a very nominal entrance fee to the place and for parking (total INR 45). The boat ride in the back waters to the beach was Rs. 300 to and fro. The boat ride was fabulous with an affable driver and an energetic set of tourists; the views from the boat were worth the ride. I clicked some scenic spots on the way before getting off at the beach. It is a gorgeous beach, very lively. I even got the opportunity to take a picture with Alexander, a horse. The rider was nice enough to take my picture even though I did not ride the horse with him. After about 30 minutes I returned back to the boat for my ride back to the parking lot. One could spend a couple of hours easily on this beach due to the variety of amusements and activities, not to mention the Sea with beautiful waves and idyllic boats."
Omg,It is gorgeous and I love the place the view the scenery so much amazing and different food and drink items kids and families place
"""Wonderful Beach in Ponicherry""",Amazing Beach in Pondicherry. From Boat House you have to take a boat to reach. its seems like a small island.. Though rchinna veerampattinam road we reach the Beach..
this place is mindblowing,wonderful beach..you have to take a boat to reach there and its a small island with some eating joints..water sports...a must visit place for people visiting pondicherry
My favorite beach in Pondicherry,"Hands down the best beach in Pondicherry for all sorts of activities- swimming, speedboating, beach sports etc."
It's good,You have to go by a boat to reach. Google maps will show a road to it but it never goes there. Search for Paradise beach boat house in google maps. It's a govt property. Ample parking available. You have to buy entry tickets from outside and boating tickets from outside. Go in the morning when it starts if u choose a normal boat. It will be crowded in the evening and we saw long queues. It doesn't matter if you opt for Speed boat. Beach is ok and there is a govt restaurant available but always rush. Better pack your snacks and water before going.
Paradise Beach,"The second time we come to Goa and again decided to stay on the beach Calangut. But of course we wanted to see new places. Friends told us about an interesting wild beach Paradise. We rented a bike and drove North. It took about two hours and it is quite a lot for bike. To get to the beach you need to go through the pine forest, which is very surprising if we speak about see and beach. The Paradise beach exceeded all our expectations. The length of the beach is about 2 km, it‚Äôs empty tranquil place. There are no shacks and almost no people, only white fine sand and clean water. There is an abandoned Fort at the end of the beach, from which you can make wonderful photos."
Small Island,This place is heaven for all who visit Pondicherry. Take a boat and go to this island and enjoy your entire day at sea shore. Don't forget to carry your drinks and food items else you will pay huge amount for these at shaft over shore and not much quality food as well.
Awesome beach,Beach is very clean and smell is also very less. Lot of life guards to monitor people. you can travel to the place 2 ways via boat trip from boat house or direct road access too. Has good provision for bathrooms and changing rooms and a small rain dance place. Enjoyed a lot at the place with family
Nice beach to play and swim,Its quite clean and tidy. Have beach guards and facilities to clean up after playing around in beach.
beautiful island,You can reach the island by boat. The boat ride in itself is peaceful and nice. The beach is great. Clear water and clean. great beach to play in water. They also have shades put up all over the place. Only drawback is we could not find a decent place to eat here. There was only a thatched restaurant with terrible food. Best to pack lunch and have a picnic on the beach.
It‚Äôs accessible by road!,"The legend of Paradise Beach ‚ÄúIsland‚Äù is such a sham! There is no island here, it‚Äôs just a regular beach accessible by road from both sides in dry, and only one side (south) when it‚Äôs raining. So what has been done by local businesses is the beach has been artificially segregated into regions of control.During my recent visit, I was asked ‚Çπ600 for me and my wife to get to the boat-house-controlled portion of Paradise beach via a ferry over Chunnambar river (which becomes more like a lake in dry seasons). It sounded unreasonable so I hit the road. As of publication of this review, there is a road visible on mapping apps. Following it we came onto a point where there was a gate flashing a ‚ÄúNo Entry‚Äù sign. But locals asked us not to pay any heed to it. So we walked over the under-construction portion of one the resorts and there we were on this beautiful beach for free! It‚Äôs the only one where you can swim safely though the ‚Äúfree‚Äù portions do not have life guards. Note: the Poorankuppam Road followed due East should lead one to the public portion of the beach without having to jump over any private land. We couldn‚Äôt explore it personally but encourage others to do so.P.S: apologies for the lack of photos, we had to leave our cameras and phones in our vehicle as we weren‚Äôt sure how safe the place was"
Nice beach,"If you want to take a dip in the sea near Pondicherry, this is the palace to go. There are two ways of going there. You can take the boat ride n go or take your car directly, its just 30mins from Pondicherry. This is not an island so don't be disappointed if the boat just takes you through backwaters n reaches the beach on the other side which you can reach via road by crossing the bridge. But the beach is clean and very nice to spend a day getting yourself drenched in the sea."
An island worth visiting,A 30 min boat ride takes to Paradise island which  is beautiful.even though the waves are a bit large there are quite a no. Of life guards monitoring the visitors and also the beach is very clean.there is also horse riding for 200 rs.and dirt bike for 300 rs.there are very large waves in the sea.my kid with my husband went a little inside the sea and got bashed by the large waves.we enjoyed it a lot.while coming back we had to climb a boat and the boat is as big as a mini ship. Overall the trip was excellent.
Fantastic beach if you don't mind paying,Surprisingly clean beach. Won't be crowded on week days since you have to pay 300 per head to get there.
Good place to spend with friends,Though there is nothing wrong in visiting this place with kids but it's most suited to spend time with friends. Especially for youngsters it's much suited. It's not suited for aged people. It's not worth the time it takes to visit the place for them. Nothing mystical about the place. It takes around 20 minutes from chunnambar boat house to reach this beach by boat.
One of the best in Pondicherry,Beautiful and clean beach. One has to take a boat from the Chunnambur Boat House to reach this beach. Hardly 15 mins of boatride. Our kid also enjoyed a lot making sand castles and playing on the beach. Would say it's one of the cleanest and best beaches in Pondicherry.
Beautiful Beach,This is most beautiful beach of pondicherry. U can hire bike on rent and go their. It is clean beach for bath
Blue waters beckon,"The paradise beach was the first beach I headed to in Pondicherry. I found it privateand secluded, with lots of time to wander around and reflect. One is lucky to findlots of sea creatures in the sand‚Äîstar fish, sucker fish and umpteen crabs. The ferryride I opted for was especially rewarding. I found a very good restaurant for seafood, with great food and service. The only minus point is that the beach is not veryclean and good toilets not available."
"A rare clean beach, must visit place",The beach is really clean and beautiful. You can reach there with a ferry ride from one of the boathouse station. There is just 1 restaurant on the beach. You can easily spend 2 hours here. The place closes at 5 and the ferry ticket last sells at ~4 so plan accordingly.
Great place,"Good place to unwind in the ocean with few activities around. They have a rain dance floor, play area for kids... The attraction is the boat ride and the Ocean.Try avoiding weekends if you dont like huge crowds."
"To do boating , enjoy the facilities at Paradise beach","Back water boating is good , speed boats are also available.Booking and entry is very smooth as well as return journey is also good . But overall facilities at beach level is not up to the standard which I have expected ."
One of the cleanest and peaceful beaches on the East cost.,So to reach this remote beach u will have to shell some cash this place is paid not the beach but u pay for a boat ride which gives u 2 options either u can take a share ferry to the beach(15-20 min)  or take a motor boat instead(5 mins) I preffer the share that way one can actually enjoy the back waters and click some good pictures on the way . Paid service also makes alot of unwanted people not actually come there like beggers and other salesmen .Went here with family . The place is well maintained with cleaning staff working round the clock to pick up trash even the one thrown out regularly by the sea. Good place to take a bath although boards say swimming not allowed but u can have fun in the shallows like the low risk areas . Try to go on a weekday to avoid local rush and also make sure to avoid a hot day. Also best place to surf if u r into sports . Some diving and snorkeling sites near by as well.the beach itself has few options for eating to .u can't stay late as the last boat leaves the beach at 5.30 pm.
Ideal for bathing ,"Paradise beach is for people who loves bathing in the sea. The beach is like a island to which you‚Äôre ferried through speed boats or normal motor boats. The beach is clean with clear sands. There are lifeguards right near the shores and they‚Äôre mindful of their work. Waves are very good. Not too heavy. Sea also is pretty clean. Once you‚Äôre done with bathing, you can take shower is the washrooms. Guys gets open showers with only tarpaulins. No rooms or doors. Be mindful of that. But thankfully women gets proper closed indoors but don‚Äôt expect too clean premises. As lot many women gathering together and women are generally restless ;) it‚Äôs chaotic . Overall beach is really nice for a day trip. You can have lunch once you return to main park. But we preferred a restaurant just opposite to the park gate. And it was really awesome."
Paradise Beach,"It's a paradiseeee.. When you step in the beach, never expect much. Just get into the water and enjoy yourself like other beaches(Nothing special with this beach)."
Paradise is close to hell !,"Nothing to do on paradise island. No transat chairs, no umbrellas, one restaurant, no beer at all.Swimming is not recommended.... No water above waist !Never back there !"
maybe the most overrated place in india,"just a normal beachyou can only go(swim) up to a point which is much less as compared to beaches like cherai or varkala (in kerala) so yeah u wont get the ""beach experience"" from pondy...and as i said its just an ordinary beach i couldn't see any beach chairs"
one of the nicest beaches I've been to in India!,"this beach is beautiful, clean and really nice. Its a nice boat ride to get here and there are shaded spots for you to chill or dry off. There is a food shack that we didn't try."
Wedding anniversary Celebration,Royal Romantic Stay in Pondicherry and Enjoyed Beaches.with cheaper Food for Meals and Dinner. Tasting  variety of ice cream. Shopping in Street sides super.

wonder full place,Its really a great experience visiting paradise beach. Such a wonder full place to spend weekend with our friends and family. Get a chance to visit once if not visited.
Paradise island ,"Nice beachHowever no sun beds, no lockers for things, very small shower You cannot swim here due to high tide and lifeguards constantly telling you not to swim too far outBut you are allowed to stay within the shallow region.There is a restaurant at the beach - decent prices and lots of deep fried options (around 90 rupees average) Cool rain dance area Payment: 13 rupees to enter the boat house, then 300 rupees return journey by boat to the paradise beachAmazing gelato from GMT at the boathouse - must try! Especially the coconut and mango"
paradise beach  &boating Experience,"paradise beach is really paradise for young couples It is a natural beach an experience of I land you can get hereby travelling on speed boats or steamer of by ferry quite new experience for tourist Greenery on I  land is an added pleasure,it is advisable to visit this place during  july august or during oct to january. As it is natural Beach so to enjoy it full you should have your swimming costume  with you."
Amazing view,"All the beaches in Pondicherry are well maintained and very clean. They are not much commercialized hence, you will see less public around. Since it was extremely hot when I traveled there, it was impossible to sit on the beach except in the evenings."
Pondicherry Beach,This place is in the same east coast of india facing bay of bengal. Can have a look at Sunrise in morning and bird watching. Nice and clean beach.
Backwater boating and beach,We took a boat ride from backwaters to reach this beach. A good quite beach. They have some activities as well for all.
Best Beach of Pondicherry,"Good Maintainance,2 beaches(private and public) and the crowd make this place very happening. There is an option to explore this place via a ferry ride too"
Good experience,The motor boat ride to the beach is awesome. The beach is clean. Avoid going there in the afternoon. The heat is too much to handle
Mesmerising,This is so far the best beach i have visited in Pondicherry. Although you have to pay for entry is worth the money. Lots of entertaining activities
A must must visit,"Whenever you are in Pondicherry, never miss a visit to paradise Island. Go with the program for a full day leisure trip. And enjoy.Hire a good boat to ferry to the island.Eatouts are available. Can have options to choose from.We liked the visit.Can take a sea bath peacefully. Take swimsuit accordingly."
Good Location,"Must visit place and get relaxed at Beach side... Paradise beach kinda small island. Place is neat, security to watch overstepping into sea... Showers for after sea bath for refreshing. Overall good one. However pricing for boating from land to Paradise beach was on higher side... 300 each for an adult... and limited options for food there..."
Good beach to enjoy evenings,Good beach to enjoy evenings. Not very clean though and food options are limited. Parking is available.
Peaceful and isolated beach,A nice beach with lots of sea creatures in the sand. I saw a star fish... Sucker fish and many crabs . The beach is isolated and beautiful
A real Paradise,"Best beach in Pondicherry. Travel in Ferry, Sea Food in Seagull makeshift restaurant was good. Good Chef and Staff. No water in Gents Shower area..It should be improved. PTDC should atleast construct temporary Toilets"
true to the name,"well maintained, clean beach however not much options in terms of food and drinks. boat ride is expensive"
worth the name!,Paradise is true to its name right from the boathouse to the beach. Excellent area for swimming and playing for kids. we went when it was not too crowded. The boat rides are expensive though including unnecessary expenses like the rain dance and all.
Good Beach,This is truly a magnificent beach. One of the best beaches in our country.very well maintained and preserved. The personnel manning the beaches are quite strict and this ensures that the beach is kept clean and neat. A must visit for tourist visiting this part of the country. The clean beach and the surroundings make it a even more attractive...
Paradise beach,"Very expensive, second no food , no water and no shade, in short no resting place.It will be difficult for children and old people."
Full of people,We went to Paradise beach expecting a 'paradise' but waited one hour for tickets to ferry. Then finally purchased a Rs. 3000/- private boat ticket for 4 people. We still had to wait and finally on reaching saw a very small area which was occupied by a huge number of people. The beach was almost black and though we went inside the sea but it was not much fun. Stayed for hardly an hour.
Quiet and clean,Please do visit this beautiful beach. Lovely palm coconut trees and sunsets in this place. Best to go for long walks in the evening.
Good beach but food arrangements should be better,"Good clean beach. Only one food outlet available, govt owned, but food quality not good. Rain dance place, ETV vehicle for kids available, changing room, and few other activities available. Good to spend time. Minimum Rs 300 entry fee to beach other than to 13 to enter the park. Parking fee separate."
Peaceful attraction,"All type of Tourist ca enjoy this paradise beach, Boat  service is run by the Pondichery Tourism Development Board to this island, Awesome trip"
An average beach,Nothing great about this beach. About 15 mins boat ride from the boat house. The beach is tidy but waters are not shallow. One cannot go beyond 5-10 metres for swimming. No alcohol and smoking is not allowed. One restaurant that serves a basic menu and a separate area for rain dance with music.
calm and quiet beach,Very nice beach to relax. Water was deep blue in color.  The beach is clear albeit sandy and for a long stretch before the water . Waves are not high and are mild.  The water is cool and gives fresh feeling though the overhead sun may be troublesome.
Good place..,"Its a good beach, like all beaches enough place for kids to play around. pretty close to the main road so easily accessible. The parking was a bit of a problem and the walkway to the beach was dirty, so be aware of this when travelling to this beach"
Paradise Beach - a place to relax,"This Paradise Beach, also known as Plage Paradiso, can be reached by the ferry boat rides from the Chunnambar Boat House. It is a beautiful isolated beach on the mouth of the backwaters of Chunnambar. The beach is ideal for swimming and sunbathing. You have extra activities like Horse riding, ATV rides, Ski Boat rides and a Rain dance area. There are shower and changing rooms available on the beach. There is a restaurant for those hungry after the activities."
Nice,Good place to relax your self with nature .you can directly closed to nature and express your mind with free of joy
fishy beach,this beach is hardly visited by tourists  and must not visit at all as its totally for fishing and very stench fishy smell
One of the better beaches of Pondicherry,"Paradise beach is one of the better beaches of Pondicherry with some access to the water while other beaches are mostly rocky! However, it's a bit far from the white town so that needs to be factored in while planning."
Clean beach feels like PARADISE,After you reach Paradise Beach you have to buy entry ticket. Then again you have to buy ticket to Paradise Beach. They will take you to the main Paradise Beach which is about 20 mins by motor boat. The scenery are worth seeing. You are also given a life jacket in case of emergency. When you reach the beach you are welcomed by a music. The beach has only one dhaba. Beach is decorated with thatched roof huts. Beach is very clean and very romantic. You will certainly like to dip and sway around. Crew are deployed for safety reasons.
One of the beautiful beach,"Wish they have more fun things to do and make it more accessible to people , better eating places, make better pathways since the sand becomes very hot to walk barefoot"
Pristine!,"Pristine sandy beaches with clear waters, very well-kept. I actually saw a group of workers tidying up the beach, they keep it so neat. Would suggest to go at a time when the sun is not high in the sky as it gets rather hot."
nice beach,"paradise is one of the most beautiful beach to visit when you are in pondicherry,however this beach is little bit far from main city.visited during early evening hour.took boat ride to reach this beach.beach was very clean and well maintained.do not miss this place."
Only beach in Pondy to feel the beach and play ,"Little far away and should shell out 150rs but I feel, if you had come so far to Pondy to enjoy the beach, then this is the place, infact this is the only place. In the 2 days I covered Auro, Serenity and Paradise island . And this is the only beach where everyone incl children can play safely. Bike parking is 10rs. Entry is 13rs per person and boat ride is 150rs. Time taken to reach from promenade is 20mins on bike. Boat ride another 15mins. Saw only one shack, but didn't try as we went at 4pm. I think best time to go is around 3.30pm i.e. start the boat ride at 3.30pm so it will not be hot and you can spend min. 2hrs at the beach. They say last boat ride return is at 5.30pm but I saw ppl still in the beach when I took the last ride. I guess we can stay until they ask us to get out."
best beach of the tamilnadu coast,"fine sand, very neat and clean beach maintained privately by the boat club people. thought the boat charges are high. but has nice facility to bath and after bath shower. rain dance facility available at extra cost. nice place to spend with a group of friends, family and for kids. this beach is ideal for bathing has life guards all around."
bit far from main city but good,"about 8 km from main city one can hire self drive scooter or an auto , one is entry ticket Rs 13 and boat ride of various boats t o island one can go in for Rs 300 boat. beach is excellent, more facilities and shades needed during summers ,must visit for clean beach"
Good one,The beach is just 10-12 kms from the city. Boat ride is good to reach paradise beach. Restaurant at paradise beach is average. Don‚Äôt try much. Good time pass beach
Must visit beach ,"To reach to this beach you have to take a boat ride, which have certain timings.The beach is very clean near and safe to play in.Carry extra clothes for changing.VERY Instagramable beach."
Beautiful and Virgin,"Paradise Beach is not well frequented by Travellers and is less bastardised by lot of visitors and then the litter around. Its clean, clam and allows you to be in solitude. Evening are better here and you can enjoy with your spouse the much needed togetherness time."
Gud to go for an evening,The most beautiful spot in pondicherry .. need to take a highly relaxing boat ride for 15-20 mins to reach this island .. then there is a beautiful beach .. clean and safe .can easily spend 2-3 hours easily with your loved ones ... A place should not be missed in your pondicherry trip .
Good.. can be great..,"The Beach is at a very prime location. Fees is nominal. However, more food and beverage options will be good, plus cleanliness and a few more shacks to rest would be even better."
Good Experience,There are two paradise beach in pondi the one near the boating spot is small and there is paid version as well suggest to go to the next one where we have lot of shacks for food and no restriction the sea food is good and freshly caught.
Clean beaches,The beaches are very clean and not so crowded as one has to pay to reach here.However charges are expensive and no proper food or beer is available at the shacks there.
White Sand !!,Boat  ride to reach Paradise beach is very nice and we could see fishes jumping out of water..On the beach there are few activities..Nice and clean beach !!
Boat ride to island,Clean beach. 300 INR per person to reach the island in a motor boat. Also offers rain dance at the spot for an additional cost. Changing rooms available to make use of after playing in beach water. Not allowed to go in night.
Good experience and beautiful beach,One has to take a boat from boat house to reach this beach which costs around Rs 300 per person or one can also hire a two wheeler and reach here. Two wheeler stops around 200 meters early so one will have to walk that distance. Beach is good and has white sands. there is only one restaurant here which offers just okay food. People can bath here and enjoy sun bathing. Water here is greenish in color and offers good view.Last boat leaves at 5 PM in the evening so one cannot enjoy sunset at this place which is downside for tourists.
Paradise experience,You should be prepared to spend some Inr before you put your feet on Paradise Beach. First to enter in a type of condo you should pay 13inr/p then you should pay for a 20min boat at 300inr/pThe beach is OK with safeguards who seem to be very anxious about people willing to swim. The facility for a drink is very much old fashioned. It is a pity that no investment are carried to improve this site making √† friendly and relaxing one.
Neat beach approachable by land too.,"Took a rental bike and followed google directions to reach this beach early morning (6.00 am) with my family (4 yrs kid). Two wheeler reaches till last 200 mts, from where one needs to take a simple walk (4 wheeler need to stop at 500 mts distance). There are couple of posh resorts near this beach in this route.No need to take a boat and reach there in hot sun."
One of the best beaches,"It was one of the best beach in India I found, water is clean and also shower rooms are available for both men and women. I really enjoyed at paradise beach, if you are going to Pondicherry don't miss to visit this beach."
Awesome place to spend a day swimming and sun-bathing,"We took an auto to reach the boathouse(7-8 kms from white town) and then a boat was available to take us to the beach.We were mesmerized by the serenity and cleanliness of the beach and ended up swimming in it for 2 hours straight. Unwillingly, we had to leave since the last boat from the beach was to leave at 6 PM."
Could've been maintained better,"There are two sections of this beach - one that you reach by boat and another where you drive. I went to the one that you reach by road. The beach in itself is good, not as rough as some of the other beaches in this coast. Biggest plus point is that there's a shower+change area a little away from the beach. While it's nothing fancy, it's clean and serves the purpose. The administration could've done more to maintain the beach better, including the access path."
Nice beach,It's not very far from White Town and you can take an auto to reach. You can enjoy the clean water and sand here with shacks.
Disappointing,Very poorly maintained. No option of hygienic food for kids. As mentioned on internet it doesnt has any sort of water sports.
Over-hyped Beach,"Paradise beach is outside Pondicherry town. One needs to travel about 10 kms by road and then take a 20 minute ride by speedboat to get to this beach; the the cheapest ride costing Rs. 300/- per person on a common carrier that seats about 16 people.The sand is powdery and nice and there are a few thatched huts for shelter from the sun. We saw a horse meant fora ride for the children.as also a place meant for ""Rain dance"".Most of the people were only bathing in the sea. There is only one pathetic 'restaurant' here where we walked out as soon as we entered.The most disappointing aspect was that the last boat leaves at 5 in the evening which means one cannot have any sunset view or a nice evening here... everything has to happen only under the scorching sun."
Blissful placeü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,I visited any beach first time in my life and my very first experience of beach was just wow I have no words to express that experience which I felt when I visited paradise beach of pondicherry. It is totally a wonder i strongly recommend people to visit this beach once in life.
Overrated,I found the beach dirty and overrated. I would rather suggest to go to Auroville Beach and to the Promenade area.
Not good at all,Beach is dirty and not maintained at all . You are likely to encounter Rowdy crowd there . There are much better places in Pondicherry . This place is avoid .
BLUETIFUL!!,I have been to many beaches in India but this took my breath away. Its like the beaches that you watch on TV :P. Jokes apart it is clean and serene and a fun place to enjoy with family. Though to reach here you need to take a ferry. We took the share one but that also costed us INR 300/- per person (which I think is a bit on the higher side as the beach is only few mins away. But then you can enjoy the place for as many hours as you wish and return by any other ferry.
Serene beach,"This beach is serene and has beautiful sand. However to reach this place, you have to take a ferry that costs ‚Çπ300/- per person and the ride lasts about 30mins. Apart from swimming, sunbathing and scuba diving, there is not much else to do here. Also the coconut vendors fleece the visitors with exorbitant prices."
TRUE PARADISE AMID BLUE SEA,"Among all sea beaches in India, true to its name it is paradise place where must visit once and a must visiting place in Pondichery"
Lot many jelly fish sighting hapoened,"Nice place to enjoy with family. And friends clean beach, the journey with boat is add on feature.Government souvnier shop is must visit for collecting cost friendly souvenirs.Don't expect much with food."
Not required,There is hardly any beach. Actually the sea here is very rough and shores quite steep because of which sand drifts from beneath legs. Road leading to beach is also not maintained nor the area around
Paradise Island- Clean and Serene Beach. Awesome Place for Half day Outing,"There are two ways to enter Paradise Island ( Northern Most part of Paradise Beach). One is by ferry and another by road. Going by Road, you will have to park your a vehicle a bit in the distance and walk till Paradise Island. Entry Fee is around Rs 120. It is worth it. Beach of Paradis Island is clean compared to rest of the Paradise beach. The Island has changing rooms, a mini swimming pool. Umbrellas to sit under. Small Huts to sit in leisure. A restaurant is also present. Beach has lifeguards and ensure you don't go too far."
Sea-Locked beach of Pondicherry,"The 30 mins boat ride from Chunambhar takes you to the Paradise .It has artistically decorated sheds made of tree trunks.However, it's advisable not to go for a swim, as the beach is not much populated .There are many photo ops on the beach to enjoy"
Rubbish beach ,"Glad we decided to take our motorbike here rather than paying the ferry to take us. You can easily drive here and park at one end of the beach and take a short walk down to the ‚Äúparadise‚Äù bit - you don‚Äôt have to get the ferry. On the approach to the ‚Äúparadise‚Äù area there were crowds and crowds of people, all separated off by rope in a small section of the beach which you are then charged to go on to. The place is rowdy and filthy with plastic bottles and rubbish. Honestly there is nothing paradise about this beach. Definitely not a sun bathing spot and i personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth your time or energy getting there - there‚Äôs nothing special to look at or see unless you enjoy a crowded beach. Pondi is not a beach place. Do yourself a favour and spend time walking around the beautiful French quarter for a second or third time instead!"
Clean Beach ,Went to Paradise during evening. You need to take a 15 - 20 minute boat ride to reach the beach. The beach is maintained very well and has basic shower facilities. There was no beach activity when we went but there were posters saying they are there.
Beautiful and little dangerous beach.,One has to little careful going to sea.  but clean and beautiful.people were actually doing yoga on beach.
Nice trip,"Goodplace with hotel ,beaches,comfortable living with afforable prices...nice trip for couples and familys"
Serene beach,"The beach is very clean and the ocean view is beautiful. The beach is located around 8 kms from Pondicherry. The boat house Is the entry point to the beach. The tourism department runs the cruise with capacity of about 15-20 passengers with the interval of 30 minutes. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the beach from the boat house. The cost per person both ways is Rs 300. The travel was very nice with beautiful back water all along.The beach is beautiful location and we can see the vast ocean ahead but entering water to a limited distance is only advised due to security point of view. But still this may be the only beach in Pondicherry where you can enjoy with water. The facilities at the beach like shade, restaurant etc are minimal and not good. The water sports are sub standard. Tourists are allowed only to a limited distance along the beach as it appears a private resort has occupied the long beach !Adviced to reach the boat house before 4 pm as they stop further trips there after."
Vanakkam Pondicherry Paradise Beach,"It's unique being an island beach accessible only by boat, and that twenty minute one way boat ride (Rs300 two-way trip per person) is the most thrilling part of this site. The beach is very beautiful, but way low on infrastructure and facilities to make it an attractive tourist spot. With timing restriction and no swimming, it's not the spot to view a sunrise or sunset or to have fun. With right inputs, the PDTC can actually turn this beach into a true 'paradise' attraction. For now, enjoy the boat trip, take a stroll on the hot sands, sit awhile under the shade of shacks strewn across, and return to put a tick on your 'must see' list ."
Awesome Silver Sand Beach,The Journey starts with boat from boat club on the sea water with picturesque surroundings. At the small lonely island you can enjoy with silver sand neat and clean beach . You can have your camera with you after payment of some nominal fee at counter from boat riding tickets.  Government has provided the security and helps for first time beach visitors. families can enjoy their unforgettable experience at beach. A snacks corner a the island enriched with fresh sea food add the visit more tasteful.
Family Ga Ga.,Govt arranges safe trip to Paradise Island must go and see the sea you can sit oh the beach the sea wqill come and kiss your feet and go. Most Lady's do this. Girls can play a lot.
Unorganised beauty.,"The place is beautiful. But shacks out there are horrible. Very unorganised for such a beautiful beach. Not a proper information guide/map, neither a proper parking lot. If you happened to have travelled to Goa before travelling to Puducherry, this trip of all the Puducherry beaches are going to be a disappoinment."
Family trip,"This beach is very clean and safe and a perfect family place, unlike some other beaches elsewhere in the county. Enjoy coconut water after sea water and some snacks like pakodas,Maggie, etc."
HIGHLY OVERPRICED,overpriced beachnever heard of entry fee on the beach they took Rs128 per person for just entry and another Rs300 per person for to and fro ferry ride pathetic shower houses no value of money
A Place to Spend some Time,Small beach with many shacks selling fried fish. You could relax there in the shade and spend some time leisurely.
Sandy beach of Pondy,"Visit Paradise beach for 300/- per head and enjoy the horse ride, ATVs, Trampoline and tender coconuts. The only glitch is that if you visit during public holiday or weekend, the queue will be quite long and you'll need to stand in queue for at least 30-40 minutes. The boat ride takes about 30 minutes and I recommend going in the late afternoon so that you can enjoy the sunset in the beach. For those traveling low budget, you can catch a bus from opposite Chunnambar boat house to New bus stand when you are traveling back to your destination after the beach visit."
Cool Place for photographers - Not that much a swimming place,Spectacular windy beach. You can reach it by boat but you rather pay the difference to a Auto-riksha and you access it through land 6 km further down the road. Pay attention to the possibility of being ripped off and overpriced for the transportation. Ask first some local people how much should it cost and make sure that your driver understands you want to go further than the boat harbor.The sea is really rough here so take care with swimming and do not expect a bikini paradise.
Sort of island,"One can reach this beach by boat ride which one adult will be charged RS 300/.Beach bath, rain dance, dirt bikes are some activities which kids will like."
Good place to visit!!!,This place is kind of an island. You have to reach the beach by boat through back waters drive of 10-15 mins. It will cost you Rs.300/- per head.The beach is good and clean.Kids can enjoy here. Good for family also.
Clean Beach,"We took boat from Chunnambar boat house to reach the beach. It was smelling bad near where we got dropped off and where we had to board the boat again. The area can be cleaned to smell less. But the beach is very clean with soft sand. A great place for family to have fun. Since we need to pay to take a boat ride to reach this beach, the restrooms and shower rooms can be improved."
Best beach to enjoy sea water in Pondy ,"Must visit for families who want to enjoy beach in less crowded place. It‚Äôs actually a Island and you reach by boat only. But you have to pay 300 per head ( I think no charges for children up to 5 yrs and 150 upto 10 yrs). In a way this system keep the crowd limited and you can avoid prying eyes.Option at beach are limited like rain dance, horse riding, ATV ride."
peaceful beach,A must visit place. It is the most beautiful beach in pondichery. Just get your bike and car and enjoy peaceful evening. This place is also advisable to see sunrise
Best avoided,"The beach is best avoided... Can't swim as water is dangerous, high winds, nothing to do, no restaurant.... A waste of time."
Terrible,"Not one of the finest beaches of south India, more so because it is smaller than the rest. Not a well maintained beach, this place is extremely crowded and unclean, litter all over, could have been maintained better."
Great Beach to enjoy water ,"It's really awesome beach for swimmers, since water is some deep near surface but quite safe for a nice swim. The private beach is the best part where you can play Beach volleyball, Rain Dance, etc. And you will find beachside shacks providing good food.."
overrated beach,"its just over rated beach...just another beach, water is very rough here.The beach is nice and clean. Limited choice of food is available there , infact just one restaurant Sea gull which is so grossy it served chicken bone in veg biryani. """"""""""This beach u can reach the beach by road(correctly marked on google maps) although no locale will tell u that its reachable by road."""""""" and the area where boats come, they charge to even enter that area !!! Goa beaches are much better. u are not allowed after 5:30 inside water."
Two sides of the beach,Swimming on the ocean sde would be a dangerous experience unless you have booked an AuroSwim personal trainer who also doubles as your lifeguard. There are no lifeguards on the Paradise beach. The estuary side is shallow and safe.
#Full on üèäüèâüèá‚õ≥,"In pondicherry one of the best beach,  little bit far away from city.You can go by boat ,both side greenery,water ...15 min ride.Everything is there horse riding, food court, Dress changing room, Music sound,vollyball, üèä swim,  rain dancing..... I loved it n enjoyed...  Best for everyone children's, teenage, old age etc..."
Very Good Beach,"One of the best beach in Pondy. It's clean beach and less crowd. Nice beach to go in Pondy out of many beaches,"
Not so exciting! ,"Hi! I had visited Paradise Beach in December 2018. One has to reach there by Motor Boat or Speed Boat. The boats are operated by Pudducherry Government and they charge ‚Çπ120/- per person for shared motor boat. Charges for Speed Boat are ‚Çπ1200/- (not sure though). The beach is nice and clean. Limited choice of food is available there. I didn‚Äôt find any exciting about the beach. The reason can be I have visited Goa a number of times and the beaches there are much happening than Paradise Beach. Having said that, it‚Äôs a good place to hang around for 2-3 hours"
Must visit,"Its a sandy beach where one can go in the sea unlike Promenade beach. One has to take a boat to this island from Chunambar boat house. The options are motor boat(Rs300/-pp) or speed boat. Charges are in the picture. At the paradise beach, one can sit in a shack, enjoy rain dance, do water activities, horse riding. There is just one shack serving food-Seagulls. Better take some snacks or have food before or after going to the beach as eating options at the beach are not good. If one is visiting Pondicherry then this place is not to be missed."
Nice beach.,"The beach can be reached only through a boat service run from the Chunnambar boat house. The boats shuttle between the boat house and the beach. You can catch any boat way forward, play on the beach as long as you want and catch the next boat back. The sea is safe to take bath and play. There are coast guards. Couple of activities like banana ride are available. There are showers and toilets available. Don't forget to take clothes and towel for chaniging!"
Paradise beach,The paradise beach is very familiar. We are so happy on there. And this place is so calm and quiet...And good place for to see the sunrise and sunset.
Perfect paradise.,"This is the true essence of Pondicherry. Kids and family will love it alike. Clean beach and crystal clear water is something of a rarity in India. Go early in the morning. A ferry will drop you at the island. Keep you Sun lotion and water handy. There is a speedboat for people looking for a thrilling ride. Though expensive, it is worth it. An inhouse island restaurant will help you quench your thirst and hunger pangs. A must visit when you are in Pondicherry."
Great beach ,Lovely beach with very little crowd. Can spend quality time and lovely weather. Chilled out. Safe for family vacation.
Turning bad over time,Long queues during peak season tells the tale about this overrated boat house being managed to take people to Paradise beachIn totality its all a scam as google maps show one can reach the beach by drive too but when you confirm none of the locals affirm the same and rather direct you to this boathouse which charges rs.300 per person for normal boat which usually takes about 20 mins to reach the beach.Visited this beach 4 years back through the same system but back then it was still way better experience. This time we stood in queue for 1.5 hours and the beach has been heavily commercialised (it was close to 0% while now its more than 50%... i wonder what wud happen when it turns 100%)Also beach has been restricted mostly to make it more secure but that has taken out the fun part of exloring the entire beach. Now its such a small restricted area that Paradise beach doesnt even come close to its name
Paradise beach ,"This beach is around 8/9 kms away from main city ,it has sandy beach , has long stretch for beach lovers , few shacks are there to enjoy fresh seafood."
Paradise Beach ,"We have visited many beaches in India and abroad. Paradise because is very beautiful beach and approach to the island through the motor boat is also an experience. Motor boat will cost RS 300/ person. Please note there are no restaurant on island, so better to get your food packed from outside. There is only 1 govt ratty, which is in very bad and unhealthy place to eat. They treat customers very bad. Overall good experience"
Good beach,Nice place to visit. Very clean beach. A must visit when in Pondicherry. Me and my family members very enjoy in this beach.
nice place to visit,"nice place to visit , clean beach and worth visiting. please avoid weekends , long weekends along with public holidays . it is too crowded during those time"
Great Experience,"This is a place to visit with your family,  especially via boat ride,  my kids really enjoyed. Would recommend to everyone."
Hands down the best beach of pondi !!,Paradise beach stands upto its name and it‚Äôd never disappoint you.this is a private beach which requires you to spend around 350/-bucks approx per person. boat house organises boat trips to beach and the ticket fare includes this.the beach has clean changing rooms and showers .you also get to enjoy rain dance and few adventure activities.this is the safest beach to take a dip with coast guards all around the place!!...it‚Äôs scenic view never fails to mesmerise the nature enthusiast in youüòÅ
A beautiful place for day trip,Don't compare with beaches of Andamans etc and just enjoy its own beauty and you will love it. Its not crowded at all. Its clean and well maintained. Has some shaded thatched sitouts which are great. Do take some snacks and water if you don't want to eat in smelly shaks there. Be a little conservative in your dressing though. Life guards are available. Though it didn't seem to be a swim friendly beach to me
Genuinely paradise!! ,"This is a beautiful beach with soft sand, clear water and beautiful shells. You could stay at resorts on this beach (like ‡§≤‡•á pondy or windflower) to enjoy access, or take ferry from chunambar boat house and spend time on the Govt maintained section of the beach. There is a public entrance next to the Wildflower resort. Must visit, when in pondicherry!!"
Amazing beach üèù ,A must visit when in Pondicherry.Pros: 1. Nice clean water 2. Amazingly clean beach 3. Good number or lifeguards around4. Peaceful place with family 5. Great journey from backwaters to sea by boatCons: 1. Less options of eating 2. Horribly maintained shower area
Good place to spend your day at the beach!,"The only golden sand beach in Pondicherry!How to reach/ other tips:1. Go to Chunnambar Boat House (Google maps navigation) 2. There you have to pay parking and entry charges (very nominal)3. Go to ferry boat ticket counter to buy tickets for ferry boat to Paradise Beach (Rs. 300 per person for round trip to & fro from Paradise Beach) where you can spend all day till 5pm and come back via return ferry which leaves every half an hour.4. Proper changing rooms, shower rooms are available at the beach (just after the entrance of the beach)5. Proper guards are there to warn you from going too deep in the sea)6. MInd the food you bring as crows/ stray dogs tend to take away the food from your bags.7. Apply lots of suncreen to avoid tanning.8. Variou small shacks are available to occupy on first come first serve basis.9. Washrooms are just adjacent to the changing rooms.10. Please bring water and small snacks with you as their are very few eating options available.11. In case of heavy rains ferry boat service is not available. (So call ahead as Chunnambar boat house is around 6kmm from rock beach."
Nice island beach,You need to take a boat ride to get to this beautiful white sand beach where there a few activities available. It‚Äôs far from the downtown but worth a visit if in Puducherry
Get there early! ,"Had a fabulous day there, beautiful sand and very enjoyable but get there early to claim one of the very few shaded seats. If not, you'll be out in the scorching sun for the day. (we arrived 9:45 and got the last seat available)Restaurant in the area is not so great so perhaps back some fruit and save your appetite for after the beach."
okay okay,Nothing great about this beach compared to what was expected. Actually nothing much great in pondicherry
Really neat and clean beach,"The beach is an excellent place to take a swim, relax, enjoy. You can really spend good time here. The sand is not pinching and the beach is very neat and clean. There are life guards also at the beach for safety. You can take the route to reach from the boat house from where after around 30 mins of boat ride you reach the beach. So you can enjoy the boat ride on the back waters and the beach also together. Nice place should visit."
Calm and clean beach,One of the best beaches in pondicherry. Please visit in the early morning to have more fun as it is less crowded
Overrated,"Not sure if it is worth waiting and travelling by boat so far and so inconveniently, as the Quiet beach on the other side of Pondicherry (where the Auroswim ocean swimming lessons are held) is as good. The Paradise beach has a peculiar ever-changing coastline at the estuary."
Waste of time!!!,"Absolute waste of time, as one has to take a boat from the jetty to the beach( which has a different charges ) Restricted and limited area in the beachFood served in the restaurant are not of great taste.Fun activities like bungee jumping and rain dance available.To return back to the jetty, one has to wait for the turn as they have limited boats for transfer.Overall, its a waste of time."
Beautiful beach,We have to take boat on the back waters to reach this beach. The beach is so clean we can play and enjoy. It is a good surfing area too.
Clean and calm beach ,Nice beach with clean water . You need to catch a jetty or speed  boat to reach there. Carry some food items as there is only one  hotel owned by tourism Dept with limited stuff.
One of the clean water beach in Pondi,"This beach is pretty clean and truly a paradise to visit as the name suggests. You need to take a boat from a jetty to visit this beach. Alternatively some narrow lanes down the town takes you to this beach.If you happen to be early, then sunrise is something not to miss. Definitely worth a visit in Pondi."
excellent beach,excellent beach to spend long time.. unfortunately water sports were not available but the ticket booking folks will lie that its available. Do bring good sunscreen lotion to save urself from scorching sun
Picturesque,The beach can be reached only by ferry operated by the tourism department and is well worth the effort and time.
With nominal lifeguards,"The presence of lifeguards is only nominal, which of course does not matter if you get a personal sea swimming trainer from Auroswim. I am not sure how clean the water is in the shallow estuary, but on the ocean side there was a shallow patch too, and it was odd to see the drunk Indians jumping in the waves from where nobody would even bother to rescue them. The coastline is constantly changing there, so you never know where the bottom will be tomorrow."
"Small, quite beach","As this beach is way from the city, it is not crowded. Swimming is allowed but seems difficult as the sea is not calm (or was not when we visited)"
Nice beach,Good and clean beach but need to improve a lot..there is no water activities or any other activities but you can go to enjoy beach and water
One of Best Beaches of India,I loved this beach and would visit this as much as I can during my stay. Especially in the morning it has zero crowd and looks very beautiful . I can listen to the sound of crashing waves all day long.in evening there is lot of visitors from villages and also some small fish carts selling sea food which look dirty and spoil the beauty of the place.  The management can do a better job in keeping the beach clean.
Paradise Beach ,"The beach is clean and white sand beach. However, it is crowded with tourists at every corner and turning into a tourist destination"
nice place,Its away from the town. one can get nice view during sunrise and sunset. Good time to spend some time with friends.
Worthy visit - date at sea shore,Beautiful place. It's a island where you reach by a boat. They change Rs. 300 per person which is worth a up and down trip to the sea through the lake. Sometime you may need to wait little longer to get the boat on your return. Plan the visit post lunch you can easily stau there till 6pm. If you visit in the morning or afternoon it would very sunny. Take required cloths so that you can play in the waves. You can take a horse ride Rs. 100 for kids and 200 for adults. Very neat and clean. You have restaurant as well for food. Good arrangement for showers. We throughly enjoyed and didn't want to come back
A boat rode to the Island,"A half hour boat ride to the Island, cost INR 300 per head.( thought this was overly expensive, especially if your in a group.) The Island had some fun spots for youngsters ( rain dance/fish spa/bungee trampoline) Lets put it this way, I would not do the trip a second time."
Beautiful beach with time constraints !,"This is a beautiful beach, I would say the best I have seen.  The beach is very clean with white sand and almost flat surface.  One can easily spend 2-3 hours and take photos.  Less crowded.I have accessed the beach from Le Pondy resort, which is located just behind the beach.   I was told that this beach is otherwise is accessible only by boat ride.The beach is open to public till 6:00 PM.  However, those who come by boat has to start vacate by 5:00 PM itself.  I took an early morning walk and is awesome.Beach have few shacks maintained, shades and some games to keeping it interested for those visit."
"Calm and Clean beach, good for half day trip.","We took ferry ride to reach this beach, though i guess one can reach by road as well. Ferry price is 300/- INR per person (parking and per person entry charges extra, we paid 55 rupee in total). Beach is pretty clean and offer good time to relax and enjoy the waves. Very safe even if you go with kids as many life guards present on the beach. Carry your water bottle and sun glasses. There are couple of outlet on the beach for little refreshments, mostly fast-food. A good place to spend 3 hours on an average."
Wonderful beach!,"One needs to catch a ferry to reach the Paradise beach. The fees are regulated by Pondicherry Government & no agents fly around. Just hit the counter & buy your tickets.Ferry ride is exquisite with serene view of water & green coconut tress just kissing the modest waves. Nature at its best. Two types are ferry are available - double decker(big) & single deck(small) Suit yourself. Of course, keep in mind the queue & timings.Rain dance is a major attraction for youngsters. Of course, there is mind blowing foot tapping music played by the authorities for you to enjoy in the rain dance.  Enjoy the Paradise (beach) CheersBharath"
Beautiful just as paradise ,"A must visit in Pondicherry. Clean water with white sand. Not much of water sports or activities. But nice scenic view. Life guards are present. Changing rooms and shower are just Okay. You need to go to Chunnambar boat house to take the boat to reach this place. If using google map, make sure to add Chunnambar as your destination and not paradise. We did this mistake and google took us to some backwater side with all narrow and broken roads. And there were at least 10 more cars just like us, following google map."
Almost paradise,"Not quite what you imagine, as still a wild surf at times so cant swim most times, but worth going as less visitors"
Overrated Beach!,"Its a clean beach but highly overrated - 1. Chunnambar boat house, from where you take boat to reach to paradise beach is highly mismanaged.2. Parking lot is mismanaged.3. Life jackets are waste and very very dirty.4. Once you reach at paradise beach, there are very few places to eat and very few beach activity which was in working condition. 5. Some guards will be standing, who will not allow you to roam from one corner to other without any reason.6. The changing rooms are very small, no hanging pins for clothes, in some there is even no water, on top of that there is about 2 inches of sand in every changing room."
"Great beach experience, clean beach, well maintained","You need to take a motor boat ride on the back waters to reach this island, which is totally maintained by the Pondicherry government. There are women who keep picking up the trash thrown by the tourists, and also life guards to keep the excited tourists from going deep into the water. They also restrict you to one stretch of the beach and do not allow to wander away so that they are in control.  Dont forget to carry your towels, beach wear and extra pair of clothing. There are shower rooms, wash rooms and changing rooms. girls can wear shorts and tshirts and enjoy the water. I didn't see anyone misbehaving anywhere in pondicherry so i presume people here are cordial towards the tourists. moreover pondicherry people are used to foreigners for many years so they are cool with girls wearing modern dresses. Local girls were dressed very traditionally. Beach slippers are the best to use. We saw some people walking into the beach with expensive footwear and handbags, and worrying whole time about spoiling them rather than enjoying the beach. Carry a backpack, no expensive clothes or accessories and enjoy the place.food options are limited only two government run outlets and limited food items. you are free to bring water and food. Open shower areas are really helpful to wash out the sand.I recommend this place for children and adults alike."
"Nice beach , but could have been better.","Nice beach , but could have been better.No water sports activities. Limited food options. But may be that's the reason this beach was so clean."
Clean sand and pleasant beach,"Had good time at PARADISE BEACH with my friends. Very clean sand all over and very suitable place for photography. You can enjoy bath at sea and keep you clean at showers. Well managed beach at pondy. ""Half meal lunch"" at hotel seagulls tastes good. Before visiting this island be prepared with bathing clothes and suit to enjoy this beautiful beach. You can enjoy and relax with your family as well."
A must visit beach,"The beach was clean and full of peace, only you can hear the sea waves sounds. I totally loved it. Indeed one of the best places to visit in Pondicherry."
Good beach,"Clean for the most part. But there is not much to do here. We ended up here thinking this is the Chunnambar boat house but it was not. If you are prepared with bathing suites, this is a good place to enjoy in the water."
A beautiful Beach ,Paradise is beautiful beach and one can enjoy some fun activities also.To reach there one have to catch boat (takes around 10 mins) Rs 300/person.You can stay there till 6pm.
Beach n Beach,Need some cleaning up of the place as its one of the best beaches in Pondy.  Windflower is just adjacent to the beach.
Very Good Beach,"Very Long natural beach,Clean,most suitable for sea bathing.Very Good Beach Experience.Safely Can take Sunbath."
Very badly maintained,"The beach is very dirty and has a lot of plastic, dead fish  and other litter there. It is sandy with lots of waves but extremely dirty. We were very disappointed as there were rave reviews about it."
Offbeat beach,"A quaint fishing village beach. We did not go via the boat house, instead took the car near Le Pondy resort. No shacks or stalls available here. Good place to just sit back and enjoy the sea."
Amazed by the beauty of this beach,This Beach was a surprise for us due to it's cleanliness and beauty. White sand and less crowded. You get to a lot of activities too in this beach
Absolute beauty,Awsm beach with super awsm view.. there is a small ferry that takes u to this beach.. and the ride itself is exciting... Overall the cleanliness was good... But if u have infanta with u then... places to keep and change them was not very good...
The piece of paradise!,"This beach is best known for surf ,sand and the ocean with a chance and joy to walk . Other beaches in Pondicherry rocky and do not offermuch chance to get too near the ocean . The gentle breeze and the waves will bring you closer to serenity and tranquility of the elements . Best time is morning at sunrise ."
Paradise Beach,"This Beach is a paradise for all beach lovers and best among all the Pondicherry tourists places. It is flanked by a flowing creek on one side and is also known for its tree houses, which are located on the backwaters. The beach is a budget one in South India as it is cheaper to access and accommodation in Pondicherry is lesser when compared to other beaches and their resorts or hotels in the country. The seashore is also known for organising a wide range of activities including cruises in the backwaters, trekking, beach volleyball, chess, picnic, themed events, table tennis, and catamaran rides for travellers. All these activities along with the beautiful surroundings, waters and golden sands is what makes this beach perfect for a holiday."
Awesome place ,"Very good beach, clean, not rough sea, enough shades, showers, one to two shacks for food.Boat ride to thebeach is good. Horse rides, trampoline, rain dance etc available.Good place to enjoy with family and friends.... Remember to get umbrella or caps and cooling glass, it's super sunny..."
"Heavenly Experience At the ""Paradise Beach""","If you want to have an amazing view of the sea, this place is a must visit.Away from the city crowd, this beach is one of the cleanest beach I have ever visited.Here you can also collect beautiful shells :)Be it friends/family/ couples this amazing beach will give you a view worth cherishing.Approx 10kms away from the main city, it can be visited by Cabs or bikes."
"Decent beach, but no quality food available",Only a govt owned restaurant which is poorly maintained exist there which can be easily skipped. The boat ride too is over priced and lacks cleanliness.
One of the best beach in india,"Paradise beach is so lovely, clean and well maintained... The waves in this beach welcome the visitors with so much love.We spend around 3 hours in the waves. Kids adults youngsters senior citizens will all like this beach alike.You can spend hours and hours in the beach and send.There are small shower places to clean you up and there are few other small entertainment like rain dance spot, kids car Ride, few restaurant etc..You reach here via a boat ride from chunnambaram boat place. This is like a private island with a wonderful beach..You can spend hours and hours with friends and family.Nice time to enjoy with friends and family"
NATURE'S BEAUTY.,"One can see Nature's beauty here. Blue sun kissed water looks extremely gorgeous with neat and clean environment. Journey from lake to beach is very peaceful and enjoyable. It is ""MUST BE VISITED"" place in Pondicherry."
Half a Day trip,"This is a good place to visit with children. At the entrance you need to pay for entry and parking. There is no charge for kids below 6. Once you enter, you need to take a boat to the beach. On entering, there are several activities like ""bungee trampoline"", ""small Atv car ride for small kids"", speed boat, jet ski, rain dance"". The beach is good. There are life guards on the beach.However, not many places to eat. So would suggest going here after lunch. We had gone after breakfast, and found it too hot. So plan to go here late afternoon or evening.  Half a day is sufficient for this place."
Clean beach,"The beach is well maintained, however there are lot of stray dogs on the beach.  Less crowded beach, you may relax there with your family and friends."
One of the best n cleanest beaches in the country,"You have to reach there by boat provided by Chunnambar Boat House at Rs.300 per person. Speed boat costs more. But it's worth as it can be the best part of Pondicherry visit.It has lots n lots of widespread white sand to play with. Basically it's a sandy beach. To protect from sunlight it has lot of huts with clean benches to sit on, 2 restaurants, showers, changing rooms, rain dance, fish spa etc. My 5 year old son enjoyed a lot there. An army of life guards to prevent any mishap on the beach.Just go there n enjoy if you visit Pondicherry."
View!!!,Beautiful but tooooo crowded in the evening the climate was pretty humid as well food options are plenty
Best beach in Pondicherry,This is a must visit beach in pondicherry even though you would have to travel a bit from the city center/white town area. Paradise beach is a very clean beach and is ideal to visit in the evening. Generally people reach there using boat house service but you can also go there by bike just follow google maps. After a point you'll end up hitting a small stretch which are accessible only through bike; follow the google maps and you'll see the beach from a distance.
Indead a great visit ,"As the name goes, it's really is a paradise. Totally isolated from the city , clean and and beautiful ."
Wonderful,"This beach was the best we saw in the area, clean, huge with a lot of life.A very enjoyable boat trip over & back.Would recommend 100%"
nice and clean beach,"Paradise beach is a very clean beach which i felt where you can bath in the water, the place where you park the car you have to walk a little bit to go to the water area. Some work is in progress for the development of beach, its not a nice place as what i heard they don't allow after 6 pm . But avoid going during noon its very hot with direct sunlight, Overall its a nice beach to have a dip in water and play for some time. Some ice cream vendors are there on the beach itself. But you can't enjoy there for long as there are no shacks where you can sit on the beach and enjoy, only the sun and beach without much shelter."
Paradise you cannot enjoy,"No doubt the beach is really beautiful. clean and serene.. However, the drawback is there are no beach shacks or sea side restaurants where you  can sit, grab a beer and enjoy this beauty... Given the temperature of Pondicherry, sitting without a shade for long is not possible..though there are some shades on the sandy stretch, but barely they are enough to cater to the no of tourists thronging this beach... However, its the only beach worh visiting in pondicherry... So yes...definitely should go once."
Good Vibes,"Enjoyed our time at Paradise Beach. It's slightly away from the city center, however worth going there. Clean compared to other beaches. Food options available are mostly non-vegetarian, or Raw Mango/Cucumber stalls. Use Google map navigation to reach here."
One of the must visits in Pondicherry,"Calm, peaceful & less crowded beach, which is almost 5kms away from Pondicherry main center. Enjoyed the beach beauty to the fullest. Also has fun activities like rain dance, zorbing etc. Reached this beach via a boat ride (20-25 min). Got a chance to view the backwaters which is amazing."
White Sand and Beauty,Very clean and beautiful beach..almost white sand. There are lot of places to sit and shades are made too. There are not many places to eat. Fish spa is an awesome thing to do there.Excellent place to spend good time.
Wow !! Awesome beach,Awesome beach.Its great fun reaching the place by a boat.The beach is very clean.Adequate facilities & life guards on the beach.Only issue is limited F&B.
Clean beach,Driving to paradise beach took us about 20 min from main town... Once we arrived we parked our car and had to walk up for about 5 min.. the path is lined with many juice and fruit shops along the way... The beach was quite clean and had very few people although we went on a Saturday afternoon..  there were no shacks... And no trees for shelter/ no changing room / no toilet.. go prepared...
6 STAR place - DON'T MISS IT,"This is the only place in Pondicherry which deserves a visit for sure, without this one you really didn't visit Pondicherry. More than anything else this is one of the cleanest beaches you would witness in the country.Now there are 2 sides of this beach, one everyone knows where people take a boat ride and then reach to this serene beach and the other side is the portion of the beach which hardly people visit and it has the same beauty as the first one. Just that no boat ride and less crowd.Water is clean, do go inside and have a good time. Go there with your friends, family and loved ones and you will enjoy each and every second spent there.One thing, do have the nariyal pani here, the gentleman selling is a very decent man and he is very helpful in case you need any pictures.Cheers..."
"Just as same says, 'Paradise'","Calm, peaceful and not much crowded beach, which is almost 5kms away from pondicherry main center. And hence not much usual local crowds are there and you will be able to enjoy the beach beauty to the fullest. You don't have to pay anything to get to the island, but there are limited eateries and less shades available during hot and bright sunny days."
Must visit ,If you are in pondicherry you must visit the paradise beach. For going there you need to take a boat ride to the paradise island from the boat club. It opens at 9:30am. Its a beautiful way to the island. The beach is excellent with some fun activities like rain dance. Water and food are available on the beach. Lots of huts are made to sit in the shade. The best time to go is 9:30am. It's last boat ride is at 4pm. There is a boat available to take u back every half an hour.
The Island is paradise but system.....,A good spot but a lot to be done by tourism department to attract more tourists. The restaurant there have so much restricted timings that tourists are left to starve.
UNSPOILED JEWEL,"As it's 8 km away from Pondicherry, it doesn't seem to get nearly as many visitors.Along with Kovalam in Kerala, I would say these are the best two beaches in India. Or, at least the best two beaches I've been to.And, Paradise or Veerampattinam Beach was EMPTY when I went there. It is incredible. Small waves, good for swimming or body surfing. I went with an auto driver who took 600 rupees from Promenade Beach in Pondicherry. He refused to budge from that price. 16 km roundtrip. I had a bicycle, but the route goes via a HEAVILY trafficked road, so biking is not safe.I understand there is a boatride as well, but I had no idea about this at the time.Take your own snacks and drinks. Only a few stalls selling snacks near beach.If you only have time to see one beach in Pondy, this is the ONE. Don't waste your time with the others as you will be disappointed with the GARBAGE."
Visited through boat journey,It is one of the must visits in Pondicherry for one day trip. This beach can be visited through boat. The boat is available at Chunnambur boat jetty. Boat service charges 300 rupees per person.
"Beautiful beach, good swim","Beautiful beach with vast stretch. You have the option to reach there on your own or through government ferry, which is paid. Few shacks there with local fish, prawns and some refreshments. They are building a structure nowadays which looks grand and will give the beach much necessary face lift."
Must go in Pondicherry,This is a island beach. First to go chunnambar boat house and 10mins travel with boat and land paradise beach.One person entry ticket 300.Spent time in more then half days. inside food and beverage not allowed. Inside paradise beach only one hotel but taste is worst and too much cost
Superb beachüòç,The places and house was Awesome and night time many of people walk into the place and the place was cool and amazing views!üòç
Great Beach,We are go there with boat house beach was awesome also some activity there enjoy with family so many people are there well maintain
Virgin beach ,"The access to the beach is a big tricky , but worth the effort ....White sand beach ....neat and clean ....less people ....morning and evening are pleasant"
Elegant and subtle,"A more of non commercial beautiful beach that longs for attention and upkeep, with no facility or options, a long walk of 1 km leads to Pvt island for tourist with modest facility. If revamped this beach could truly turn paradise...bad roads no signages really don't make it appealing"
Run your way across the shore,"Paradise beach is a decent place to hang out. The shore here is more fun than the waters. There are a lot of crabs here so make sure you do not roam bare foot. For somebody's who is a fitness freak, this place makes for a good running spot. I was here with my friends and spent a good amount of quality time. I would not recommend anyone to venture deep here because the waters are not very clean."
Calm beach,"I ts a nice beach, very clean and less number of tourists at a time makes it a very beautiful experience. There is ample space for sitting for those who don't wanna have a bath in the sea. The changing rooms are also very well maintained."
The beach which has lost its charm ,"I visited this beach in 2015 when it had all the amenities and few cafes, however I didn't find any of them functioning good time. There were some water sports and beach football however no other major attraction. Not worthy for even spending jetty ride money."
Not a good beach..,"It's not a good beach. Quite dirty and it stinks. From approach wise, it's ok. However, dint find any safety and security measures. Not even a single life guard was there. disappointed.."
Nice and well maintained beach!,Its a very clean beach. You can spend a lot of time here. You can swim and take a bath. Changing rooms are also available. You have to take a boat to reach this place. GPS takes you striaght to the beach qhich has car parking which is 1 km away from island but you can walk that distance and pay the entry fee of 128 rs to enter into Paradise beach. But please prefer to take the boat way. We went by car but had to walk alot to reach the island.
