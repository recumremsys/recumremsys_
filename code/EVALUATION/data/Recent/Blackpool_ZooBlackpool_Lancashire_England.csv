Well worth a visit,We had never visited Blackpool Zoo previously and despite having a teenager in our party we set off to see what the zoo could provide. Car parking was plemtiful and a three pound daily charge was not expensive. Zoo was prepared for the current COVID world in which we live. Hand sanitisers and markings to allow for a safe day. Unfortunately some other visitors don't appear to undrstand social distancing but you can't blame the zoo for that. Get a grip folks. First animal viewed was the elephants which set the tone for the day. Cafe was well laid out for a quick drink and bite and not expensive. All in all we had a very enjoyable day and will return when back in the area. Recommended to anyone.
Wonderful visit,"Seeing all the animals and participating with people ,lovely to see them all happy and well cared for"
Great day out for young and old alike!,"Loved the one way system marked out. Plenty of hand sanitizing stations too. Food and drink available without too much queuing. Plenty of seating too. Friendly, helpful staff, ensuring rules followed. Car parking easy and roomy. Can pay for parking when purchasing ticket but then you have to walk back to car. Just a tip, it's not a trek though. Would have liked some virtual/pre recorded information to listen to about the animals but there was lots of information to read, so not a real issue. At the Elephant House, one of the attendants took time to answer my questions and she was very knowledgeable too. We were concessionary couple and had just as much fun there all day as the children. Would definitely recommend!! Priced right too, we thought."
Lovely Big Zoo,"We visited on Monday as a family of 3. We were surprised to find we had to pay for the Zoo car park on arrival. It's worth noting the car park does not accept card payment or any type of online/app payment - just coins! This was round £3.00.The Zoo was nicely laid out and all the animals were well looked after and had lovely big habitats. We were really impressed with the Covid safety measures put in place. There was hand sanitiser everywhere, reminders of where to stand and the restaurant exceeded our expectations on the measures they had in place. In the restaurant we both had burger, chips and a coke - our toddler shared what we had. We paid around £12.00, which we thought was good. It took us around 5 hours to walk round the Zoo with a toddler so it's a good day out."
Blackpool zoo,"Me and my partner visited here while on holiday to blackpool. It was quite hard to see the big cats. The elephants were great to see. You have to pay for car parking even if you are a paying guest, there is no card option so make sure you take £3. Took us about 3 hours to walk around."
Nice zoo,We went on Sunday 27th September at around 12pm.  Our visit lasted around 3 hours.  The zoo was busy with a lot of young children running around and screaming.   I wish parents could use some control over them. Some were even howling at the wolves which was winding them up and making them obviously distressed so they started fighting each other.  There was no staff member in sight to ask the children’s parents to keep them quiet.   The animals In general were in decent sized enclosures but I do remain torn between knowing they are safe from predators and poachers but not having their natural life in the wild.   We ticked off most of the animals on the map supplied. Just never found the penguins!  It was a lovely sunny day so pleasant way to pass an afternoon.
Disappointed but fun nonetheless ,Told that due to ‘health and safety’ my almost 4 y/o couldn’t use his small scooter!!Notices and staff at venue as well as online informed us that closure was at 17:45 however we were asked to go to the exit at 16:30!!That being said the animals were great and service centre staff polite and we had a great time overall. Missed some of the animals due to closing early
Zootastic,Even though the weather was dreadful my visit certainly wasn’t- I spent a good hour and half walking round - all the animals were so well cared for - friendly helpful staff.  A really good place to visit even with the current restrictions.
excellent,"brilliant fun day out, kids really enjoyed seeing all the different animals, easy to find and parking wasn't that dear"
Excellent precautions taken.,Outstanding.  Zoo has done a brilliant job in making us safe. Well.laid out one way system.  Signs everywhere.  Lots of opportunities to clean and sanitize hands. Kids had a great day despite the monsoon weather.
Birthday ,The elephant and dinosaur experience was amazing. The quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant was excellent. The staff have put a lot hard work in to make things safe.
Amazing day out!,"Visited here with my boyfriend and 10 year old son and we were very impressed and it was way better than we expected.The Covid safety practices were very well planned out with one way systems, hand sanitiser stations everywhere and you had to wear masks in the indoor areas.The enclosures are the biggest ones I have experienced for most of the animals and it is clear that the Animals are looked after to a high standard, this shows in how the animals behave in particular the otters and sea lions.There is also plenty of picnic areas and play areas for the kids.We will defiantly be back.Anna, Phil and Joseph."
"Good Zoo, Too much queuing","Visited here on a Friday afternoon. We went expecting there to be queues however it was quite a bit worse than we thought. Distancing seemed a little excessive and we waited for 15 minute stints all over the park. One being just to see the tiger asleep. Once you had queued and entered the houses you then felt pressure from behind to get in, have your look and then leave... Just not the same experience at all. Consistency wasn't quite there either with some enclosures not advertising distancing and queues at all.. whereas some were really strict. This is all when picnic areas were jam packed and children's play areas in full flow..Despite all of this it is still a very nice zoo with a good selection of animals! Recommended for all the family.. Just be prepared to wait!"
Brill,"Absolutely loved it, had great time, was nice weather and kids loved it very much. Staff was great as well"
Lovely amosphere ,Very impressed very well social distanced people with disabilities can get into the zoo Cheaper with support worker or carer with a cea card booking I would recommend and very good parking and very nice social distance in the cafe and the staff are very friendly and helpful would recommend to anyone who wants to visit in Blackpool and a great day out
Good zoo,"A great day with the family. Right from the start you could see it was busy but everyone was socially distancing and I felt safe. Loads of animals to see but I’m not sure why they need the dinosaur section. We had purchased meals vouchers online and the queue for the restaurant was busy, we had been told to use only one restaurant but a member of staff then informed us we could use any one."
Brilliant Zoo,"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend yesterday and we had a great day! There's so much to see, and the animals are well looked after and happy! The car park could accept cards just to make life a bit easier, but no complaints other than that. Majority of people had face masks on in indoor areas, and people were distancing themselves. Toilets were clean. The cafe wasn't overly expensive, £12 for 2 hotdogs, lots of chips and a drink is around what we expected to pay."
Great place,Went there the other day and it was lovely staff great and no problem with social distancing a realy good time for the kids as thay allso had there own section would totally recommend it.
Family day out with a toddler and 6 year old,"Had a really good day out. Felt safe with all the covid restrictions put in place. Masks had to be worn when seeing indoor enclosures, one way systems in some places. Restrictions on numbers to see some of the animals and some areas closed off. All staff were friendly. We all had lots of fun seeing the animal. Peacocks and geese are free to roam about the zoo. Beware of seasgulls trying to steal your food if sitting outdoors."
Good visit would recommend,"First visit to this Zoo and we enjoyed it. It’s a lot smaller than chester zoo, but there was plenty to see. I Mirror what others have said about the long lines for food, but it’s got to be expected with what’s happening now. Most people were wearing their masks and adhering to the distancing. Overall it was a good day out and I would recommend it."
great experience,Had a fab time overall.  Quite a large zoo - was quite surprised - and tired!  There's some great platforms to see the elephants and giraffes higher up.  You can take a map on entry - which is really helpful.One thing to note people weren't really social distancing and it was hit/miss when people wore their masks.  People didn't observe the 2m rule or small groups.  I didn't attempt to buy food as I'd assumed they wouldn't be open or there would be distancing issues / big queues.One big negative to note is the overflow car park is out of date - the machine only accepts coins and doesn't give change and also doesn't mention you can buy a parking ticket inside - this as a minimum should be noted on the machines - even though one of them wasn't working!
Day out with family . We loved looking at all the animals . We were there for a weekend break .,There were 6 of us . 4 adults and 2 children.  The track and trace system was really good and hand sanitizers everywhere . Plus everyone wore facd masks . Which made us feel safe .
Hungry for more?,"Came to the zoo this time with an open mind with all the new rules and regulations due to covid... In whole, they are trying with the indoor mask policy, limiting numbers in certain places, such as the giraffe viewing area and the gorilla/orangutan house... But I feel they need someone to enforce the 1 way system in wallaby walk, or close it off altogether like they have with the lemurs, as there were lots of people ignoring this when we were thereFood wise, it was a hot day when we went, and it's pretty stupid that every food outlets on site is CLOSED, except for the main cafe... We queued up for 35 minutes to order 2 pie & chips (originally going to grab a quick sandwich, but not worth £3.85 for a cheese sandwich)... Told it'd be 5 minutes and it'd be brought over to us... 15 minutes later, it finally turned up.Obviously the zoo's main attractions are the animals, and they all looked well cared for, elephants were happy playing with their toys, and we got to the wolves just in time for feedingOverall, the zoo is doing well, I just hope next time we go, they decide to get their act together with the food outlets"
Was ok but busy,"Was very cramped, no1 adhering to 2m distancing rule, the pigs looked like they were ready to drop dead, the food in the cafe was ok, blackpool quality standard food if you know what i mean. Overall id say avoid and go the park and feed the ducks and save your money. Or if everton are on, watch them."
Superb zoo! Great day out,"We had a wondeful time at the zoo with our family,so many wonderful animals to see and a joy to see that they look very happy and well looked after.The elephants looked absolutely majestic as did all the other stunning animals.Great little dinosaur area my child loved to .Best zoo I've been to without a doubt. TIP= bring in your own juice and sweets (sandwiches) save a lot of money"
Sunday jaunt,I have visited years ago and loved it so still scored 4. Although I expected queues with  covid measures even trying to get an ice cream was painfully slow not enough staff on duty and would have known numbers arriving as had to book in advance.
Zoo visit,Loved seeing all the animals obviously no feeding times because of the circumstances but enjoyable non the less. Staff were friendly and helpful
Great place to visit ,Great place to visit in this very strange times. Great social distancing in place.  Lots to see and  do. Well worth a visit.
A cool day out.,"I attended Blackpool Zoo with my friend and don't regret it at all. There's a great array of animals to see, which include, among my favourites, Howler Monkeys, Wolves, Giraffes, Monk Seals and many more but, strangely, my favourite part was the Jurassic Trail, a fascinating walk amongst fibreglass model and animatronic dinosaurs. A great day out for friends and families."
First time at Blackpoo Zoo,"Was our first time at Blackpool Zoo.  Was very plesently surprised at the variety there.  Well spaced out and lots of information displayed on the particular animal.  Only critism is the lack of talks and displays.  It's well beyond lockdown now and if people can be in the stands overlooking the pool then you can restart talks, feeding times, displays etc....  Definitely recommend and will return again rather than going to Chester Zoo."
Great zoo,"Brilliant medium sized zoo. Massive range of animals from elephants, Lions and giraffes to meerkats and anteaters. All seemed to have plenty of space and were looked after.Covid restrictions were in place with some of the indoor/play areas closed but still plenty to see. We stayed 3.5 hours but with kids and everything open you could easily spend 5-6 hours. Plenty of benches and tables for picnics.Bit disappointed to be charged £3 to park when we had spent around £40 for our tickets, but this is Blackpool where they like to screw as much money out of you as possible."
Fab day at Blackpool zoo,A wonderful day out in pleasant surroundings.  The animals seem happy and well housed and cared for. The staff were all helpful and friendly and we felt safe.  Social distancing is adhered to with a one way system round the park.
A bit sad,"Definition of a zoo. Paid £20 each when half of it was shut and there were no shows due to covid. No proper monitoring of masks indoors. Animals all look pretty sad and cramped. Queues everywhere to everything. A lot of places do set times you can arrive from, this was a free for all and heaving with people and seagulls hovering around your lunch. OK but probs won’t go back."
Great Day Out!,"Visited the Zoo as a birthday treat. We have been before but came especially to see the Red Panda. The day we had in the zoo was great. The staff have tried their best with the COVID-19 procedures. Unfortunately sometimes the guests forgot and got a bit close so we moved on. Loved seeing the Red Panda and saw the Elephants for the first time also. Sorry no pic of the Red Panda, they are on the camera 😊"
A great family day out,"There aren't many places which can keep my 15 year old son and 6 year old daughter entertained at the same time but Blackpool Zoo fits the bill. It's a perfect way to fill a day. It isn't so huge that you feel you've missed half of it, but it's big enough that it feels like a good day out. There is a good range of animals to see from the big cats to the funny penguins, funny monkeys and even an owl to spot. The dinoasur trail is good fun too.The children's play area is great for when little ones need a break from just looking at things. It did get very busy though. There were a few more queues with the current Covid situation. Don't leave it until you are really hungry to get a snack or meal as it takes a while to wait at the cafe.We were blessed with good weather and enjoyed our day very much."
Fab zoo!,"This is the second time I’ve visited this zoo, me and my partner loved it!I was very happy this year as I got to see the wolves as they didn’t make an appearance last time I visited and they are my fave animals.Weather was nice so that was a nice addition to the day, the elephants still fascinate me.We will probably be back again someday"
Great zoo ,Great day out.  Enjoyed the animals.   Too many people hanging around the cafe area.    Dinosaur area is great fun.
Best day out!,We've never been to blackpool zoo but we will definatley be returning! The whole set up was fantastic especially under the current circumstances. The zoo itself is fab and you get to see all the animals up close which is great! Theee is a dinosaur safari near the elephants which is really good and very life like! The onsite park is great for little ones. It wasnt overly busy when we went but we felt very safe and there were staff all over to clean things when needed. Will definatley be recomending and visiting again very soon!
great day out,"had a really good day here apart from the rain. Only complaint was food arrangements, despite a sign saying you could get food by the childrens farm it was closed. I qued for ages in the main cafe which was annoying as I was behind loads of people who were waiting for hot food and all I had was 2 pkts of sandwhiches. Eventually I managed to speak to a man who was clearing the tables and he was very helpfull he took me out of the line and took me to the ice cream counter and opened up a till and served me there, why cant the sandwhices be located there> Thank you to that man he was fab"
Lovely Zoo,The animals looked well cared for and the zoo itself was very clean and tidy. Plenty of hand sanitiser available and operates a very efficient social distancing system
Good day out,"Booked in advance. All parts of zoo seemed to be open. Well worth a day out. Followed all covid protocols, staff friendly, sanatiser stations at all attractions. Some queuing required but not unacceptable"
Overpriced and rude.,"Overpriced with no deductions considering most places restricted or even closed. One staff member wrestled something out of my sisters hand and verbally abused her, all in all a very average day out."
Great day,"Excellent place and well run by all the staff, the weather was amazing which made it even better., nice open spaces and good facilities, we took sandwiches but ended up sharing with the birds !!really enjoyable day with the grandkids"
Excellent day out,"We had a wonderful day, COVID precautions are in place they did not affect our visit and made us feel safer. Animals all seemed happy, loved the elephant and giraffe enclosures. See you again soon."
amazing,"what can i say this zoo we had a great time but you need a whole day for this to look at every animal its absolutely  amazing better than your west midlands safari park ,Dudley zoo and even Chester zoo this is one place i can  definitely recommend with out a doubt the animals are amazing they are very well looked after nice and clean and plenty of room for them. we were even there in feeding times the staff were very helpful with questions we had about the animals, Accessibility round the zoo is also very good.we had a meal which was part of the ticket well worth the money we only paid about £2.93  as it was 50% off  eat out to help out food nice staff Friendly  all provisions was in place for Covid 19 and social distancing, will go back again to Blackpool even if it is just to visit the zoo thank you for an amazing day out this is one memory we wont forget."
great zoo,"went here with the family for the first time, and i was surprised at how good it was, nice size zoo, food was ok. lots of monkeys which was great"
Enjoyable day out,"clean safe environment. Brilliant day the zoo is very good was nice to visit and would recommend.  social distancing was about 80% but never caused a problem and majority of people were wearing masks indoors, outside was your own personal choice.  The staff were great and were constantly checking how many people were inside and if there were too many would ask you to wait.  The zoo was a great day out.  Can't comment on the food places as we didn't use them, they did look busy though not sure on waiting times. All in all a good day out and very enjoyable."
Christmas 2019,"We visited Blackpool zoo to basically see Santa! It was raining which made it all the more fun we travelled from Hull across to Blackpool for the day! The zoo was empty just how we like it probably because it was December and raining, no problems at all apart from seeing Santa himself, It wasn’t the best and we couldn’t all fit in the little shack he was sat in, the reindeer’s wasn’t there, maybe they flew back to the North Pole but we couldn’t see them! It could of been so much better my 6 year old son came out saying that’s not the real Santa! The zoo though was amazing we love Blackpool zoo and visit regularly!"
Love this zoo,"Lovely little zoo, been 3 times now. Great place, friendly staff and reasonable price food in cafe.Lovely day out."
Great Day Out,A great day out. Its was busy being BH weekend but not too busy. We spent most of the day there. All the zoo is so well laid out and all the animals looked happy in there large enclosures. We took a picnic and found there was plenty of places to sit. We especially enjoyed the walk through Aviary .This was one of the best zoos I have been to and will defiantly be going there again.The car park is next door to the zoo and cost us 3 pound. Its coins only  at the machine.
Great visit,Another great visit to the zoo. We love coming here. Great range of animals too see. Good one way systems. Nice and clean. All the animals well kept. One of the best zoo’s around.
Animal Experience,"This zoo is fantastic and so are all it’s keepers.  I bookd an experience for my wife and daughter.  Social distancing was observed to the letter with only about 25% capacity.The experience brightened up my daughters day.Entrance costs are not as dear as other zoos, animals were well looked after.Best zoo we have been to and we have visited several in this country.  YOu can get closer to the animals here.Will definitely return, thanks to Ellen who lead the experience."
No social distancing from Clientele ,A great day out - but no social distancing from the customers We went with 3 and 6 year old both enjoyed it Used Tesco reward points which is always handy! Have to pay £3 to park - no where else to park
Good zoo!,"Really good visit, kids enjoyed, ,much better than Chester zoo. Covid rules were good, lots to see when going round, food was expensive and not great but the visit overall was good, will return again."
"Great Zoo, great staff apart from one","Great Zoo, staff were extremely friendly apart from the one girl who was manning the toilets next to the cafe, she was bossy, rude and obnoxious,  spoke to us like something she'd trodden in (date was 30th August) she needs to go back to school to learn lessons in manners especially to her elders. Food in cafe was great value and because we went in early it was quiet.  Lots of hand sanitizer around the zoo. Parking great although costs £3, I'd of thought it would of been free as you pay enough for park tickets."
Fab trip,Enjoyed Blackpool zoo. Organised during the current Covid situation. Animals appear well looked after and good amenities
Lovely Zoo,"Lovely zoo with great staff and some beautiful animals. Very Covid safe with free masks on the way in, regular hand sanitising stations and controlled numbers inside. Very good for the price."
Great day out,"We visited with a 2 year old and 9 year old. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit, the 2 year old loved the dinosaurs and models around the park more then the live exhibits, the rest of the party commented on how many different animals they had to see.We saw a red panda moving for a the first time, and heard the lion roar... fabulous day out."
"Shame, Blackpool zoo is not like it use to be","Really disappointed to say but this experience was one we wish we hadn’t encountered. You arrive and have to pay for parking, which is ok but not expected when paying for a entry but not only this there is no card option so have to pay at counter. You are then expected to return to the car to put in then renter all during covid. Staff members are rude, not helpful and to be honest disrespectful. You would think that you aren’t a paying guest. For example being told to move along when looking at animals, being told to wait (while your young children have already entered a part of the park). To top this experience off the animals are hardly no where to be seen and half the park seems to not be open. Unfortunately covid or no covid the lack of customer service makes me know that I will not be returning anytime soon."
Excellent Day out!,We had a fantastic time as a family day out. Due to COVID regulations we had to queue but not for long!
Day out to zoo,"I loved it,the kids loved it, not enough time to do everything, what a place, what a turnaround, it's been 30yrs since I was last there!, great to see the change, couldnt fault it, the eating facilities were great as well, busy but quick to get served, the seals were my favourite, the kids loved it and keep playing the recording we made lol.Will defo be back!"
no social distancing,"more people here than before social distancing,  shocking imhoDid not feel safe park was packed out,  would definitely not return in current climate."
Love the zoo! ,"First visit to Blackpool zoo and for a mini day out me and my partner had a good day. We absolutely adored the elephants!! Obviously with current situations it must be so hard for the zoo but I thought they done really well at keeping social distancing measures and i think it’s really unfair that people in certain other reviews are having a moan off! There was clearly marked out pathways and queues to get into inside enclosures so they weren’t overcrowded, loads of signs, hand sanitiser all over the place! This zoo is a fair size smaller than our local zoo but we still had a really good day and would come back again."
Lovely zoo for a day out,Lovely zoo - enough to see for a day out. Good variety of animals that seem happy in well thought out habitats. Cafe has a good selection of food at good prices.Plenty of toilets which are clean.Staff friendly and helpful.Great gift shop.
Overcrowded,"Awful. Far too many people in the zoo, not sure how they have limited visitor numbers. There were no spaces in the car park and the additional carpark was also near capacity. Crowds and queues everywhere you looked. Social distancing is only attempted were a member of staff is there to enforce it but everywhere else people were pushing and shoving. Felt really uncomfortable. Comment from my 5 year old when saw the outdoor play area ‘wow mummy, I have never seen such a busy park’"
Cold with tigery showers,"Mixed feelings, loved the zoo with the animals (my daughter was cross as a photo of a koala on the way in but they don't have any koalas) but the price was frustrating. Discounts for a family of four but not a family of three, surely the same could be applied ? The park is laid out nicely, we saw all the animals (elephants were our favourite) with the penguins showing off hilariously. Social distancing was hard so kept my mask on, queues were large everywhere. We did the pre bookable meal, not great. The adult burger was not nice at all but the chips were. Definitely go again but with a picnic 😀"
Fab day out,Great zoo. Well laid out. Plenty of animals in spacious but visible enclosures. Shame parking isn’t included in the price.
Great day out,"Really good day out can easily spend 5 hours here if you take your time, had a picnic on the benches, lots dotted around the park. Its not the biggest zoo but i personally think it is better for young children who get tired walking long distances, there are different animal's to view around every corner. The price is competitive and when you have a large family this makes a big difference. Overall it is the busiest i have seen the zoo even though we have visited in the summer holidays previously, this is obviously due to people opting for days out rather than holidays this year due to covid, so if you are at risk or feel uncomfortable around a lot of people i would avoid for now, but definitely look once kids return to school."
Fantastic,Great place my kids loved it had great day there good facilitys very clean and tidy definitly going again
Amazing day and left really happy,With out a doubt this is best value for money. A family of 4 price is well worth it. Had an amazing time some really amazing animals to look at and the dinosaur area is an amazing hit hit the kids. And with this covid-19 going on the staff was great to keep it safe for people to enjoy. Would recommend any body out that way to visit and have a great day. And took about 3/4 hours to walk around. Well happy 😊
Terrible experience!!!!,"If you do not care about the current Covid 19 pandemic then enjoy your day!!! If you care about your health and that of others close to you avoid this Zoo. The zoo has information plastered all around the park in regards to social distancing, do they adhere to it and help support the public to then the answer is no. The day we visited the weather was dreadful windy and rainy we saw between 6 - 10 staff. The gift shop was an absolute joke. The member of staff had a clicker and was asked how many people were in the shop she laughed and said 19. There was more like 60 people in. The duty manager was rude and obnoxious and I will be writing a separate complaint. I understand times are difficult and it is hard to manage the general public but they didn't even try. I will not be returning EVER!!!!!!!"
A great day out,"Visited as a family of four and really enjoyed it. Lots of animals to see including tree porcupines (who knew?!). We also visited the restaurant/cafe placed near the entrance. Queue was long and took about 25 minutes to get food, but the food was plentiful, piping hot, tasty and reasonably priced. We paid £25 for four hot meals plus drinks and we didn't visit on a 50% off day, so Mon to Wed would be even cheaper. There are also plenty of picnic areas/tables dotted around the zoo too if you wish to take a picnic. There are two car parks at the zoo (one is an overflow) and the cost for the day is £3. If you don't have the correct change do not worry as there are staff members with card readers available to take your payment. In regards to covid, the zoo has put many things in place. You have to pre-book a visit as numbers are limited for each day. They currently let 2500 people in a day which is 40% of their usual capacity (this may be too busy for some). All visitors must wear masks in indoor spaces, and most of the staff had masks on too. There are many hand sanitiser stations throughout the zoo and there are also staff members with sanitisers at the front of the queues that are in place for some animals. There are queues for giraffes, wolves and penguins, where the staff limit the number of people at any one time. The queueing areas all have social distancing guidelines on the ground, although some people ignore them (that is not the fault of the zoo though). The restaurant has one queue to get in and has a different, separate exit. The tables inside are well spaced apart and are sanitised/cleaned thoroughly between uses. They have a simple system which is easy to follow and tells you which tables have been cleaned and are ready for use.  All of the animal enclosures have spaced viewing points as well, taking into consideration social distancing. The keeper talks have been suspended for now but instead the zoo has introduced animal talk podcasts which you can access using a podcast app and then listen to at your leisure. There are signs by enclosures letting you know which podcast you need for that area. Each toilet block has a member of staff monitoring them and they tend to let one in as one comes out, to ensure they're not too crowded. When it comes to leaving the zoo, there are two lanes - one is for the shop and one is for the exit avoiding the shop. Other reviews have said the shop was very busy and chaotic, but when we left it looked really quiet and people were distanced. We didn't go in the shop though so I can only comment on how it looked when we went past. In all I think the zoo has done a pretty good job of making the site as safe as possible for visitors, but be aware that not everyone likes to follow the guidelines. As an outdoor space though it is quick and easy to create distance between you and the 'invincible ones', and easy to take a route where there are fewer people. We really enjoyed our visit and we felt safe, so wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others. Visiting animals in the open air is very therapeutic and if numpties get too close, you can always give them a sharp jab in the ribs with your elbow."
Ok for small children ,My 13 year old and I visited the zoo. The zoo has been well equipped for the social distancing etc. Unfortunately I've previously visited South lakes zoo so blackpool was a little bit of a let down. We did the zoo in 1.5 hours.A few of the animals mentioned on the map weren't there at all. The dinosaurs were really old and dated but the smaller children who were there still enjoyed it. I wouldn't be in a rush to return sorry.
great,brilliant day out worth the money had a picnic which i would recomend taking with you as it may be cheeper for larger familys but loads to see fantastic
first time visit,"Visited for the first time and the zoo was fantastic   the kids loved it. There wasnt slot of social distancing which prompted me to wear my mask throughout the whole visit but other than that, fine, plenty of hand sanitisers around. Staff with bottles of it in their hands"
2500 visitors per day!!,"It's our families first time visiting and we really enjoyed the variety of animals and they all seemed well cared for. Staff who we spoke too were very pleasant.... Our only issue... the amount of visitors! We pre booked our tickets and was under the impression guests would be limited, My husband asked a member of staff how many people was allowed in per day...2500!! It was so busy in all areas and many were not socially distancing. We have 3 young boys there was not a chance we was allowing them to play on the outdoor play area it was so overcrowded. I don't feel we can fully blame the zoo for this but it's definitely a worry."
Good Zoo but it's a great place to catch Covid,"Been quite a few times over the years to Blackpool Zoo and we have always enjoyed it.Not so much this time though due to the covid virus where by now we should all be aware how far 1 and 2 metres is in real time.Yes the animals are well looked after the Asian elephants are enjoying their new enclosures and the Sealions despite not performing are just cheeky and playful as they have always been.The big let down is With regards Covid 19 and the hap hazard way they are treating social distancing in different parts of the same zoo.The websites clearly states they are operating at under capacity to keep people safe yet yesterday was the busiest we have ever seen it.As you enter the zoo you are asked in person to wear a mask even to go to the loo which was patrolled by an employee as to how many could enter the toilet at once which is great but the queueing outside is not being done at a social distance mainly because the zoo has decided to keep closed some of the toilets  making the open ones in high demand.Certain parts of the zoo has natural bottle necks especially around the 1st cafe which is where people enter and exit the zoo, it needs a simple keep left keep right system putting in place as has been done in other parts of the zoo.All staff are happy to provide sanitiser gel and they all wear masks. Staff are placed close to all indoor viewing areas and keep numbers down entering the buildings but once again its the waiting queues of people that need reminding about distance yes there are markings on the floor but people either forget or choose to not bother. Other parts of the zoo do not have people on the door and this then provides the perfect opportunity for people to not wear masks.I firmly believe the zoo is letting in too many people which I understand is down to a huge loss in finances this year.The outdoor kids playing area was absolutely packed with kids and parents enjoying themselves but once again social distancing is forgotten about which considering that it's right next to a outdoor food area where kids and parents are running\walking past people seated eating is somewhat concerning.Is it fair to blame the zoo as they have obviously made efforts and spent time on money on trying to make the zoo covid secure but the amount of people they are letting in is far too many the closing of toilet facilities causes problems and the lack of trying to keep people in queues apart is totally overlooked yes a lack of staff to help maintain this could be solved by having the gardeners do this at busy times.If somehow by the time you are leaving the zoo feel as though you have managed to avoid the virus then you have a final chance of getting a dose if you exit the zoo via the shop as once again it's a huge queue my tip is to look for the smaller sign that points to a exit that avoids the shop.Within 15 minutes of entering the zoo we decided it was much safer to wear a mask  all the day during our visit despite us not normally having severe fears or anxiety about going to places now that we are allowed more freedom since lock down. Considering that the zoo is in the North West where all around it infection rates and lock downs are on the increase its worrying to see so many people in the zoo  if it is wanting that many people in the zoo at any one time then in my honest opinion it needs to do much better, opening all toilets re allocating job duties that are not as vital as the zoo keepers such as the gardeners etc to help marshal queues and bottle necks. Close down the play area near the cafe, have staff on duty at the petting barn better signage to keep people   to the left of their side of the footpath asking parents to keep better control of their children as we witnessed loads of kids running about without their parents being about jumping queues and using the gap where some people were trying to social distance from a different party of people. Yes some kids don't understand as they are too young but most do. Best advice I can give at the moment is if you do visit Blackpool zoo is to jump into a hot shower afterwards and don't visit Granny for14 days afterwards unless she has left you a huge amount in the will!"
Lovely day!!,"Went with a work colleague and client who is disabled.Enjoyed the day,very impressed with the guidelines and adaptions for COVID,well done Blackpool Zoo!!"
Lovely day at the zoo,"Covid restrictions seemed well managed with constant reminders about face masks and using sanitiser. One way systems in operation to make more Covid friendly, and very helpful staff stationed throughout ensuring this ran smoothly. Would strongly recommend going first thing as it was starting to get quite busy when we left at about midday.We particularly enjoyed seeing the lions, giraffes and elephants. I also had a close up meeting with a kangaroo! We would definitely return."
It's just a nice zoo the space is there some animal enclosures seem lifeless,"What you need to know; We booked online which gives a small saving in advance in light of current events. You get an email confirmation and e-ticket. I drove and it is well sign posted. There is sufficient parking which I imagine would be full on a weekend or sunny days as I've read. Take £3 in coins for their pay and display car park (for the whole day) - very good value and it benefits the animals or if you haven't got change then there is guest services where you can pay. There are numerous staff members and sanitising points right throughout the zoo, which was good to see. It's a spacious zoo with good access walkways throughout for all abilities. As with any place they are adapting like us all to the guidelines so everyone must take responsibilty for themselves to keep safe distance but in the main no issues.No shows on at present and it's luck of the draw on which animals you'll see because of weather and how busy it is! Fortunately we took our time inbetween the occasional shower and managed to see most. Certain areas are cordoned off to reduce the likelihood of visitors being too close in enclosed spaces.It's a shame that some of indoor bird zones walk-through areas, animal demonstrations, and mini train aren't currently able to proceed but ultimately this iswith guests safety in mind. But that doesn't reflect in the price of their tickets! Having previously reviewed this zoo sometime ago they hasn't been many big changes other than the elephants relocating. Some areas still look tired and dated.Despite this there are still some great attractions. The introduction podcast commentaries, and the base camp for the new elephant zone is coming on. The giraffes, orangutans, mountain gorillas, big cats and more will still keep you busyIt's a nice zoo and we made the most of our day despite rainy moments. It'll be a while but we will return in the future"
What’s Covid!!,"After a very pleasant day at the zoo with grandchildren we were so horrified by the gift shop at the end. Everywhere in the Zoo is following the government health advice with sanitising stations everywhere and plenty of social distancing until we arrived at the gift shop. We waited outside until allowed to go in then once inside it was total chaos! No one was listening to instructions, staff couldn’t have cared less when I complained and there were definitely too many people there. I suggest you give the gift shop a miss! It certainly isn’t worth catching the virus over."
"Nice place, Poor response to H&S concern.","Had a great day out @ Blackpool Zoo unfortunately the experience was somewhat ruined later by uncaring staff so I would just like to warn others whilst visiting this zoo.Basically my little boy (2) managed get free and quickly duck under one of the log fences separating the elephant enclosure. Thankfully I was quick enough to react and managed to jump over the said fence and catch him before he was zapped by the electric fence or got into the elephants enclosure. It was near miss but I feel there there is a potential accident waiting to happen here - Either by an individual coming into contact with the electrified fence or getting in between that and into the enclosure with the animals.Naturally I contacted Blackpool Zoo to raise my concerns who took almost three weeks to offer any kind of response.Then i got this:Dear Mr. BlahBlah,Thank you for taking the time to email with your concerns regarding the fencing at the elephant viewing area.  I would firstly like to assure you that the safety of our visitors, staff and animals is our main priority. The elephant viewing fencing, mesh and warning signage combined with adult supervision of children, has been fully risk assessed by ourselves, and also inspected as part of our Zoo licencing and elephant specialists reviews. The control measures in place have been passed by building regulations. With regards the mesh only being present in certain areas of the elephant fence line, this is because the Ha-ha (vertical drop) is directly behind the fence and the area was meshed to reduce the risk.These assessments are regularly reviewed and we will take your comments on board when we review them.*No apology or any real explanation that made any sense:Now i'm no H&S expert and I'm sure you will agree you can clearly see the hazard in the photos. - Especially to little ones.So at this I decided to ring the H&S officer responsible for this excuse of an email. She basically said I should be looking after my kid and said the photos that I had provided didn't show anything to be concerned about. She then went on reiterate what was in her email.So furious with these comments there is no vertical drop of any description ?? And so many exposed areas where access can be gained into the enclosure. I had to ask her if she had looked at the correct pictures I had sent.Anyway I will be taking the matter up with the relevant authorities but in the mean time I would just like to make people aware. Because as we all know kids do run off or get lost occasionally.Anyway other than that a great day out for the family with good facilities and plenty to see and do. Would recommend but be vigilant!"
Good day out,We had a good day at Blackpool Zoo and the staff were very friendly.  Everything has been set up for social distancing.  My only concern was that some of the enclosures for the larger animals seemed a lot smaller than at other zoos.
Day out ,The zoo was a good day out some animal were not out because it rained a little but it can rain any time but still had a good day
day out with grand son.,"Enjoyed the full experience, Wewent yesrerday 18th august 2020.The staff were excellent Plenty of announcements going out about self distancing, also very good about people in and out of areas.We pre booked our tickets and food, an excellent idea.In all an excellent day out. The rain did not put us off.The staff coped very well."
A few concerns regarding social distancing!,"We are in unprecedented times but the booking system fools you into false sense of security. It allows you to believe you are booking in for the day and therefore numbers would be managed.That wasn't the case on the day of our visit. The car park and the overflow car park were virtually full. The zoo was incredibly busy inside.Control measures in certain places were positive but in others, limited to say the least.The zoo was far too busy in this climate and it did make us a little apprehensive throughout the day.Its a great place to visit and I am sure they are doing the best they can but more thought has to go into safety and social distancing.If you are concerned about Covid, read some of the reviews before making a decision to visit. Just my thoughts as a parent of young children."
Vulnerable,The zoo has introduced restrictions to combat the spread of Covid and there were some amazing animals to see BUT even if there were reduced admission numbers it was the most vulnerable and at risk we had felt since it’s onset in March. It was extremely busy with queues everywhere. Although it had been expensive we left not long after we had arrived as felt that not enough was being (or indeed could be) done to make it more Covid safe. I can understand why the Govt  was slow to allow zoos to reopen. If you are blasé about Covid then go and enjoy the zoo but if you are still rather nervous then absolutely give it a miss.
Visit during covid ,"I honestly don’t know why they have got such bad reviews off people who visited during covid.The zoo have made plenty of changes, one way systems in places, face masks worn in all indoor spaces, plenty of hand sanitiser stations around, queuing system to get to the very busy animals like gorillas etc. Queues to enter cafe and only one way in and one way out, all tables and chairs sanitised after each use.In all honesty if you’re still moaning after all this is being done it’s probably best you stay home for now.We visited today for our sons birthday and had a fantastic day. We actually enjoyed the changes made as it meant less shoving and pushing from people to see the animals etc.We’re all adults and it is our duty to socially distance ourselves, however it is quite impossible to always socially distance in a busy place like a zoo so it’s more about common sense. We didn’t have a problem at all throughout the day. Queue moved quickly for food, however I do feel it would be easier to have two separate queues. One for hot food, one for cold food. We only wanted sandwiches and had to queue for about 15 minutes, which when you have a toddler can become rather difficult. And when we got inside the cafe queue it became apparent it was probably taking so long as most people ordered hot food. It wasn’t until leaving the cafe we noticed a little bit serving ice cream which had the odd sandwich so we could of probably been in and out in a few minutes had we known that was there.We did only buy food as we knew it would be 50% off with the eat out scheme, what we had was nice but I do feel had we paid full price it would of been way overpriced.Kids playground was really busy which we had no issue with. Seen others moan about this but it is quite difficult to make children distance themselves. All they want to do is play.My only other niggle is the fact the baby change has no toilet in it, so I went in the ladies toilet and the baby change unit isn’t even in it’s own cubicle, it’s right next to the sink which to be honest I really didn’t like. I had to change my little boy as he’d fell in a puddle and he was stood up on the changing unit with no clothes on with people just stood staring whilst waiting for sinks. Overall we will definitely visit again! Glad we went. We went to Chester zoo back in July andBlackpool zoo was a much more pleasurable experience for us!"
Busy!!!,"Firstly I would not want to visit on a day where it was not limited numbers. It was absolutely packed! Got there about 10.30 and car park was nearly full. We decided as we had our 1 year old with us to eat as soon as we got there at the lake view cafe, entered for a polite member of staff to direct us to the other entrance if we wanted to eat in which we did. Joined already fairly long queue, to get to the front to find out it was for the toilets! A a little more clarity from the staff and possibly some signage would of been helpful as this was very frustrating. Queue for the toilets at each point was fairly big, but understandable due to the safety restrictions. On both toilets I visited, the first the toilet in the baby change was out of order and in the second the baby change was in the femaleToilets both times it was a massive inconvenience to have to go hand the pram over to the other half and have to rejoin the queue to go to the loo myself. There were queues to see quite a few of the exhibits, which again we were fine with. However other people seem to have no awareness of social distancing! Also queued too see the wolves, to find they were nowhere to be seen! A heads up from the staff member would have been nice to save us all the bother of traipsing up the walkway for nothing to see, I know it’s not the staff members fault they were in but she could of just let us know they were inside. We did have an enjoyable day and enjoyed a lot of the exhibits. Just far to busy."
Brilliant day out,"Brilliant day out! Myself, husband and my 2 teenage daughters spent the day being entertained by the wide variety of amazing animals with their hilarious antics and robotic dinosaurs that move, roar and even squirty water.Social distance is in place and works well with staff getting people to queue for some exhibits, but the queues go down quickly. As well as social distancing in place there is also hand sanitizer everywhere.Due to the Covid-19 there are no shows which is a shame as we could see that some of the animals miss performing especially the sea lions. This zoo isn't as big as Chester zoo but is just as good and is a lot cheaper to visit even the gift shop is cheap, we will definitely be returning."
Chosen by 12 year old for her birthday - A,The lion roared while walking around the fence - amazing.  All the animals were fascinating and I loved the red panda and all the different monkeys.  Recommend a visit for sure.
Tiring and awful,"We left halfway through, we were that fed up. We assumed that you were getting everyone to book so that it didnt get overcrowded, what with all the social distancing and covid regulations. However after our visit, we cannot see the point because you let way too many people in anyway! We didnt feel at all safe because it was impossible to keep even half a metre apart with the amount of people in. We didnt want to queue to see certain animals (the giraffes and penguins had the longest queues) because it was a really hot day and the queue wasnt socially distanced either. Yes, you could say that people are in control of themselves and they could distance themselves, however, if there is no space to do this, then no they cant. With the heat, and the amount of people, we couldnt stand it anymore so we took our daughter and left. Luckily she is only 1 and saw lots of animals anyway so wasnt disappointed but it certainly wasnt worth nearly £40. If you can't maintain social distancing, you shouldn't have opened. Maybe you normally do follow procedures and maybe we went on a bad day, however you should be maintaining low crowds and not allowing so many to book every single day. Makes me think you dont care about the people but solely the money. If you put donation buckets around to give money to support the animals and maintenance of the zoo, the guests would probably donate so that you made up the money that you would lose in sales. At least the guests would feel safe and you wouldn't lose too much money. But it is purely about the money isn't it."
Great  family day out,"We visited Blackpool Zoo fairly recently. We booked on line as required and this worked well. The only thing I would reccomend is possibly a booking time slot also. We were greeted on arrival by staff who were advising the use of hand gel and throughout the park there was plenty of hand sanitizer throughout including being attatched to the parking machine. Although only some parts of the Zoo were one way only, there were signs throughout to remind of social distancing and staff on hand to advise and help where necessary - all  of who were very helpful and friendly. The Zoo is perfect for a family day out with plenty to do and see. Understandably certain areas were closed due to the Covid situation and some enclosures were restricted to a certain number of people causing ques for some of these areas, however this did not deter us and we enjoyed our visit and seeing all the animals. The only fault with this was that at times people would be standing too close in the ques - ie: not always adhering to social distancing rules. It was however nice to see that the Zoo were trying to implement such precautions at this time to ensure people felt as safe as possible during their visit. The general public also need to take some responsibility. Blackpool Zoo is set in lovely grounds and is a must see for young and old. I hope this Zoo can continue to thrive during these difficult times and look forward to visiting again in the future."
Birthday outing with family bubble,"First trip out since lockdown with family, Dad's 81st birthday. Had a bit of trouble with confirmation email from Tesco vouchers staff so helpful whilst it was sorted. Prebooked as you have too although busy it didn't feel unsafe or over crowed lots of open spaces and  lots of helpful staff. Hand sanitiser throughout zoo, get a great view of the animals new elephant area is fab. No shows at the moment, masks needed at entry, shop and inside cafe lots of spaced seating so no issues if you need to rest up. Drinks ice reams etc priced well. Great experience and we had lovely weather too would highly recommend."
Excellent,Excellent zoo. Facilities were very clean and had plenty of hand sanitizer around the zoo. We will definitely be returning.
"Absolutely packed, too many people.","First of all let me say I've been to Blackpool Zoo a few times and always loved it. I visited yesterday with my family and it was chaos.You have to book online, but the zoo seem to have allowed too many people to book at once. The car park was full at 12pm and it's pay and display (£3 and you need change, can't use card or your phone to pay.)There were queues for 70% of the exhibits, we missed about a third of the animals because the queues were too long to stand in.  There are staff posted at points reminding people to wear their masks indoors (this includes toilets). The staff were spraying down benches and picnic tables between people sitting there. The kids playground was insane, so many children. It was disorganized and far too crowded the whole time we were there. We usually spend a good few hours at the zoo, but just after an hour we were done. Considering how much entry is, it was really disappointing.Also why are there smoking stations?! Just ban smoking outright in the zoo. I lost count of the amount if times we had to walk through a cloud of smoke even though people were using the designated smoking areas. You have to walk past them to get to other parts of the zoo! Probably won't visit again until next summer now."
Perfect,Plenty stations for hand sanitizerGood system for the current situation seemed particularly busy everywhere before lunch quietened down alot  about 2pm lots to see and do we spent all day here
Day trip,"We weren’t really impressed with the Zoo, of all the attractions this is one that cost the most and didn’t impress us.  We won’t be visiting again"
Good Zoo. Bad Organisation ,"Blackpool Zoo is fab! There’s lots of animals and it’s generally lovely to walk around... usually. Today we visited. I was worried as I could see there wasn’t as much organisation as other zoos Ive during the period. No arrival time slots, still making you use pay and display machines.. so as we got there the car park was FULL. We had to use the overflow car park. It was absolutely rammed. There is no chance whatsoever! At all! That they are selling limited tickets. Even if covid didn’t exist, it still would have been too busy for me. Queues to stand by enclosures miles long.. no chance of getting food. the children’s park was absolutely swarming. It was wrong to be honest and I didn’t feel safe. A couple of one way systems where absolutely needed but not enough at all. The zoo I visited a few weeks ago had a FULL one way system around the WHOLE zoo. Could have been better. Will look forward to visiting again when this is over."
Good zoo,This is a very good zoo and is better than Chester zoo which is not to far away. There’s lots to do in there and the monkey dome is especially exciting. Unfortunately when we went some parts of the enclosures were closed and I wish I seen this on the website however if it was on there then I struggled to see it. Definitely book ahead and there’s lots of parking for anyone that’s driving
Fabulous day out!,"Excellent family day out with lots of animals to see. Everything was clearly signposted, lots of one way systems throughout with hand sanitizer everywhere around the zoo."
Poor handling of the current situation,"Social Distancing? Limited pre-booked entry? Doesn't appear to be the case. Absolutely rammed packed. Busiest I have ever seen it. Hand sanitizer stations empty, none at all by the car park machine I used which is touched by everyone wishing to park here. People refusing to wear face masks in the indoor areas. Impossible to keep 2m, no one seems to care and very little in the way of reminders around the place. Games machines open to play and with no sanitizer next to them. All this in the first 10 minutes of entering. Very irresponsible and poor management of the current pandemic."
Amazing! Brilliant Wholesome Day Out! For All Ages!,"Went on Aug 9th 2020. Have to say we loved every bit of the zoo, hundreds of animals, all easy to see. Clear markings & guidelines for Covid. Staff were friendly and approachable. We spent about 5 hours here easily and stayed all the way until closing time. Went with 2 kids, ages 12 & 6 both were very happy. The animals are so memorable and feel like they interact. Would love to come again and would highly recommend!NOTE TO PPL COMPLAINING ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING ETC: the zoo has put into place markings etc and staff helping out, if your that scared then why have you come to a PUBLIC ATTRACTION?! And if the zoo started limiting tickets even more then you would be complaining there’s no tickets available! Remember millions of ppl have been affected by this whole Covid situation, appreciate that at least we have places like Blackpool Zoo to go to! Shut up & make the most of it!"
Excellent day out,"Well sign posted 1 way systems, abundant hand sanitiser. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable and courteous when directing people around the zoo. Offering hand sanitiser everytime you see a staff member. Had a fantastic day today with my 6 year old. Will definately visit again. Spent over 6 hours there and went around the zoo twice. The animals look well cared for with lots of enrichment and natural habitats. Plenty of signs explaining about each animal and with optional podcasts available. Food was lovely and plentiful, need to get food early as it gets busy quickly. Beware the pesky seagulls as we saw many a child's food stolen. Excellent day out, will be buying a membership for the year as its only an hours drive from home."
Our Annual Zoo visit.,"Our annual visit to this Zoo,  despite the current times (covid 19) we all had an excellent and really enjoyable  time, plenty of room to social distance, loved the fact that some of the viewing platforms had a member of staff controlling the amount of people on them at anyone time, this meant you could actually see the animals. Times before social distancing you have to shuffle and be slightly forceful in order to see. The governments current idea to encourage people to eat out meant that the food was very cheap. It wasn't too busy so we didnt struggle to find somewhere to sit and eat, we took picnic blankets because we thought we would struggle for seating and maybe sit on the many grassy areas but there was no need.Plenty of one way systems in place to keep people away from each other which was observed by most. The Elephant enclosure was impressive as ever, specially now that the bottom part of the viewing was now open so.we were able to get closer and better photos.Pity the daily shows are cancelled for obvious reasons but it still didnt distract from an enjoyable day. We'll be back again next year."
Sunny day out,"We visited here on Saturday for the first time in a couple of years. Social distancing measures were put in place wherever possible, and staff were on hand to ensure one way systems were adhered to. We were informed that the Elephant area was busy, so we returned there later. We didn’t go into the ape house due to a large queue, but we were able to see the Orangutans and also the Gorillas in their outdoor enclosures. Most of the enclosures are of a good size, although the big cats should probably have more space. There was a lot of baby animals, which is always great to see! (Sitatunga, Giant Anteater, Greater Rhea and a few primates!). Tickets had to purchased online prior to our visit to ensure we could get into the zoo. Overall, a very enjoyable day."
A Great Family Day Out,"Great little gem in Blackpool. Easy access via public transport, which was great as none if us drive. Due to covid things were clearly going to be a lot different to normal but the staff had worked so hard to implement measures to keep visitor safe with plenty of social distancing measures & hand sanitiser around the zoo. The animals looked happy & well cared for & there was ample variety. Admittedly it was rather busy & a hot day so there was queuing for food but even that was well organised for social distancing. There was a great variety of animals & it was great to see them in enclosures designed to represent their natural habitats. I would recommend that you don't try to squeeze the zoo into a couple of hours as to get the whole experience you ideally need to spend a full day there. There was also plenty of rest points for when my feet gave in due to the vast size of the park. Although not all aspects were running/open it was still a fantastic day out. The gift shop was our final stop which had an ample amount of souvenirs to buy- my daughter would have happily maxed out my bank account in there. Highly recommended."
Good to get back!,It was lovely to be able to visit again. Well organised with plentiful handgel available. Some places got a bit crowded but we simply moved elsewhere & went back when they were quieter.
Great,Always a great experience and lots of new things to do and see now. Locals discount offered so good value for money
An excellent small zoo,"A great family day out. The zoo is small enough for little children to get round but large enough for a surprisingly large range of animals including lions, elephants, camels, many monkeys and all looking healthy in spacious enclosures. There was a dinosaur walk which was fun and which did not hesitate to show dinosaurs feeding on prey and looking threatening. Well done for realism. Staff were delightful. Food was a bit expensive - isn't it always- and long queues, probably partly because of coronavirus arrangements which were extensive. I'd recommend taking a picnic. Beware the seagulls, swooping down to grab food leaving some startled children.Our family group spent about 5 hours there and loved every minute."
Loved it,Had a great day even though both the lions and tiger where sleeping.. my son loved the dinosaur attraction as much as the animals
Great value for money,Had a great day at Blackpool zoo with my husband the staff were really helpful and friendly and there was plenty of hand sanitizer around the zoo and I think the one way system worked really well really good value for money will definitely come back again
1st visit to zoo during covid,Overall a good day out.Covid safety measures in place were adequate but occasionally there were too many people about especially when looking at animals.Would definitely visit again .
Not covid friendly.,"Fabulous zoo but we went during covid 19.  What is the point of booking if there is no timed entry? How do we maintain social distancing when we have people so close behind us they are stepping on my heels? There should have been timed tickets. Also dismayed at how dirty the windows were on the animal houses and the colour of the penguin water was so revolting you couldn’t see the penguins in the water. Having been a few times we know this is usually a clear blue, not sludge green. All in all very disappointed by the lack of covid awareness in a town that is close to another lockdown."
Blackpool Zoo during covid-19,"Visited as a family of 4 on the 30th July 2020. Booked tickets online 3 weeks prior to visit. Upon arrival, a staff member gave each person a pump of hand sanitiser and then we handed over our e-tickets. Note - My daughter had to show her student ID as proof for her student ticket. Zoo was a lot busier than we thought it would be. Had to wait 20-25 minutes to see the big cats and giraffes. Staff were very good and only let a certain number of people in the exhibits at a time. In particular, we loved the new exhibit for the elephants! There was plenty of hand sanitiser, one way systems and social distancing markers, but there was a lot of people who didn’t follow this. Would recommend taking a picnic as hardly any places open for food. We queued 30 mins for x4 drinks."
1st Visit ,"We went as a family of 5 today.  Children aged 14, 10 and 4.  Booked online last week.  Queued for a few minutes to get in and there was a worker there giving us hand gel.  Went through, showed our tickets and we were in.  This was our 1st visit.  Had to queue maybe 2 or 3 minutes to see the giraffes and the penguins.  There was plenty of hand sanitiser to use everywhere. Was a one way system in use around the park and I would say people followed this about 80% of the time.  I felt uncomfortable a couple of times when looking at animals and some adults brushed past me to get a better look.  I just had to move away.  People need to remember we are in a pandemic.  All in all it was a lovely day and we will be back again."
Take a picnic ,"Been here today with two granddaughters which we booked in advance via internet as apparently they restrict numbers though it was quite busy so seems hard to believe .  Anyway it’s a great zoo that’s not too big with elephants, tigers, lions, giraffe, gorillas, orang Utans and lots of other animals.  You can’t go in any indoor areas at moment but it was a pleasant day and we didn’t need shelter from rain.  We prepaid for meals which involved standing in a queue for 40 mins to get the most  disgusting overcooked burger ever but the chips and nuggets were nice.  There are loads of places to picnic which I recommend you do rather than wait forever.  There are loads hand sanitizer stations everywhere and toilets cleaned regularly."
Well worth going,"Good few hours spent here on my Birthday, cafe has limited food but good value,  staff brilliant, and cleaning and  sanitisation  was good, all animals well looked after though some areas you cannot visit at present"
Great visit ,"We had pre booked tickets and paid using Tesco Club card vouchers, we had stayed in Blackpool the day before and we planned to visit the zoo before we came home. The torrential rain very nearly put us off bothering at all but decided to give it a go even if we weren’t there long. On arrival we were only about the 4th car on the car park hence the weather so wasn’t expecting it to be busy. Before we went in we were able to purchase rain ponchos so that was helpful. So glad we went now and didn’t come straight home. Staff are doing a great job, good social distancing and hygiene measures in place. The animals were fab, saw them all. Got some brilliant pictures. All the animals were visible either outside or inside where you could walk through and view through the windows, markers on the floor so there were only so many people looking at one time then when they moved on the next group could go through. We had pre booked a meal voucher so went for that when the food started to be served at 11.30, staff are cleaning tables as soon as people move so there is mostly always a table free, glad we had food early as when we had finished there had formed quite a queue to get in. We were there for 3 hours obviously would of stayed longer if it had been nice weather but we had an enjoyable time and saw everything we wanted to see. Lovely place and will visit again."
Disappointed docent cover it.,"I booked it for my boys birthday day out as I read reviews on here and it sounded well organised....  I would have to disagree, as it felt like shambles, I know it’s not the staffs fault but people there were just obnoxious, nobody were fallowing any rules, pushing past you, standing in middle of two way system and just chatting so you had no other option then push past them, there far and few staff there and they weren’t really doing anything to move people along or remind them to social distance. Food place was just a joke, 30min just to get some drinks, there were stickers on floor to keep people 1 m apart while waiting but did anyone follow them???!!!! NO I  tried to keep my distance but it’s hard wen someone is breathing on your neck to move you along. I been trying to be super super carful and respectful of other people and rules thru this pandemic. Play area just looked like breading ground for virus as there were that many kids on it at once that you couldn’t see anything else, yet again no Staff to monitor the situation, so you only can have 3 families watching penguins but it’s okay to have 100 kids all running around at once?! The other thing I don’t get is why have they shut all the little drink, snack shops thru zoo, wouldn’t it be better if they were open so hundred of people didn’t have to gather in one place?! On way out my little boy wanted to spend some of he’s birthday money in shop to get some teddy’s, so you had to wait in line outside the shop, put your mask on. Looked safe, that was until you actually entered shop, everyone were pushing, grabbing  there were no one way system. Or if there were nobody cared about it. Safe to say that from now on I will be avoid any public places as I can’t cope with other people’s ignorance."
"Great zoo, poor catering","The zoo was great- rather busy but quite well organised. Not a lot of social distancing but trying to implement a one way system, lots of hand sanitizer etc. HOWEVER - the catering would get 1 star. It was very badly organised. Took 45 minutes to queue up to pay for a sandwich and cold drink. The actual cafe seating was clean and well organised but you could have died of starvation waiting to get your food. I’ll be taking a picnic next time."
Great Day Out,"Great day out, was really impressed with the variety of animals out on show and the staff were great"
Worth every penny!,Worth the moneyHours of fun especially for kidsGood cafe reasonably pricedCovid secureNice to switch offAnimals great Dinosaur walk v impressive Large gift store Fun play parkWill definitely return 5*
Very wet visit but a good visit!,"We booked online as everyone has to do now, we checked the weather, looked good until it didn't, the weather changed and unfortunately we had to go in heavy rain, noting to do with the zoo but it does dampen the day, literally! On arrival we had to pay £3 parking, after paying £62.99 to get in for a family of four it wasn't great but I understand the zoo has still had to maintain the enclosures, feed the animals and pay trained staff during lockdown, one of the reasons I wanted to visit while on holiday was to support the zoo as I love animals. On arrival we were asked to sanitise our hands before entering the building. As we walked into the zoo one way systems were marked everywhere and sanitiser is placed around the park. Near the entrance where the dinosaurs are there is a sign to tell you this is a busy part of the park and gives you times if you would prefer to come back when it is usually quieter. There was huge queues to see the orangutans and gorillas, considering it was heavy rain when we were there we decided not to stand in line, it was disappointing we missed out on some of the most intelligent and amazing animals in the zoo, I would suggest heading there first before the queues start. I wouldn't say it was too busy as some others have said, its a large area, if your uncomfortable with a crowd miss that enclosure and come back, some animals are more popular than others and crowds do form I wouldn't say it's because too many people have been let in. We walked around for three hours and it was rushed because of the rain. We went home early because we were soaked, we would maybe visit again, we do feel it was expensive compared to other zoos in our area but I am happy to help at a time that has been difficult."
Great  day shame about the rain,"Great day shame about the rain, got to see majority of the animals  that I want to see, restaurant staff were rude  towards my mother who was in her mobility scooter when we came in to get food they expected her to stay outside in the rain whilst I went to get food when she clearly was restricted to a reduced menu how else is she to chose what she wants when she is out side getting wet. Not impressed at all."
Bad,"Let’s start by saying that you have to not only pay for tickets but also parking and if you don’t they are signing penalties just imagine coming back from awful experience to pay penalty. Absolutely awful job with distancing regards to corona, people doesn’t fallow because there is no clear indication and guidelines. The map itself awful and doesn’t help to find what you are looking for."
Agree with previous posters not Covid safe,"I have to agree with previous reviews about the zoo being too full and feeling unsafe with regards to Covid.We went also on Wednesday and there were more people there than I have ever seen on previous visits despite getting there early on the day. Everyone was well managed to start with staff sanitising everyone’s hands as they went to queue but once allowed inside there were people walking everywhere not observing safe distances.We had previously gone to Dudley zoo a few days before and they had it managed much better by having a one way route for the entire zoo,different entrance and exits,limited numbers of guests who pre-booked a time slot,lines dividing areas that were not completely one way so people stayed on the right etc it was much better managed than Blackpool.We did cut our visit short because of feeling unsafe.Only positives were the animals looked well cared for and the staff were friendly.I really hope the zoo take serious notice of the reviews before an outbreak takes place,I strongly advise devising a one way system around the zoo like Dudley have with staff stationed at various points to enforce the distancing guidelines."
Definately NOT Covid safe - far too many people,This was our first visit since reopening and we did not feel safe at all. Information on the website had all sorts of reassurances about restricting numbers of visitors but it was just the opposite. I would say there were more people than on a Bank Holiday. You could tell how busy it was by the fact that even the overfill car park was full on a week day. Initial impressions were good. There was someone to greet you with a spray of sanitiser and the queues at the entrance were controlled but as soon as you entered the grounds it was a complete free for all. Our first stop was the Dinosaur walk through and we couldn't wait to get out. There was supposed to be a one way system but it was not 'policed' and so people were wandering around all over the place and the signage was misleading. On leaving the area we were faced with crowds of people and so we left straightway. Very disappointed. They really need to rethink their idea of 'limiting' numbers. We will not be returning
We all left happy ,"Visited the zoo with the wife and kids (7 and 2), over all we really enjoyed the experience and the kids (and me and my better half) left happy.The price for a fun filled day out with the family is very competitive and I really can’t complain at all.Highlight for the kids was seeing the giraffes as up close and personal as anyone ever has in their enclosure and the highlight for me was the wide verity of monkeys and seeing the baby gorilla 🦍 playing, which was the icing on this day out.Some of the enclosures and facility’s were closed due to covid which was to be expected, I would however ask why one set of female toilets / baby change was closed but the joined on gents toilets were still open? The ladies were using the gents cubicals and fellas were changing babies on their knees because the cue for the main toilets / facility’s were hhhuuuggee, the bird enclosure was closed as well which has an open (metal wire) cage like roof but some of the smaller room exhibits such as the inside part of the orangutan was still open? I’m sure there is a reasonable explanation but couldn’t work it out myself..We ate at the zoo cafe which was outside seating only and was a quick 20 mins wait to be served, staff were on hand to make sure anyone that just wanted a sandwich or coffee were directed to the right and quicker cue,  the sun was shining and we took our food away from the seagull attacks near the cafe to the bench to watch the camels etc which just added to the great day, they normally have you over a barrel with these sorts of spots price wise but I thought the food was a fair price and very tasty indeed! Fancy a picnic? There was loads of people who brought there own food as well.All staff we had any interaction with were friendly and helpful.Social distancing was in place although it seemed like a free for all at times, keep your distance stickers on the ground and plenty of hand sanitiser for everyone.Overall this zoo and day out gets a solid 8.5/10 from me and my family and we can’t wait to go back!"
Too Many People! Not Covid Friendly,"Our visit definately wasn't covid safe in any way. They're letting far too many people enter, it says a lot when the overfill carpark is full on a Wednesday. You can't look at an animal without a croud of people coming standing right next to you. The amount of kids playing on the park was also a joke and the cafe was rammed, they definately should not be open.We left fairly quickly as the main 'attractions' such as the giraffes had a queue bigger than alton towers on a Saturday. What we hoped would be a nice relaxing walk around the zoo turned into something worse than buying toilet rolls in asda. Please limit the amount of people you're letting in! It's ruining the zoo experience for everyone"
Fabulous time had by all!,"Blackpool Zoo tickets can be purchased via their website.  Book online for additional discount.  A family ticket saved us £7.01.  We arrived around 11:30am and there was a short queue to get a car parking ticket which cost £3 for the day.  The zoo was much busier than we expected post-lockdown as we had to park in the overflow car park.Staff sanitised our hands prior to entry and advised which lane to get in for the ticket kiosk where our QR codes were scanned.Our first port of call was Base Camp to visit the elephants followed by the Dinosaur Safari.  Watch out that you don’t get soaked like we did!  The kiosks at the entrance to the Safari remain closed due to the pandemic but the seating areas were open and offered fantastic views of the volcano fountain!  Our favourite parts of the zoo were the Sea Lion & Penguin Pools which have a spectator arena to watch the animals at feeding time.  There are currently three restrooms open to the public as the ones by Darwin Centre are closed.  You’ll also find vending machines are out of operation but there are a couple of ice cream kiosks open as well as Lake View Cafe.  On observation, Giraffe Heights and the play area near to the Orangutan Outlook were a social distancing nightmare.  The rest of the zoo you were able to walk around freely.  There is plenty of outdoor seating and grass verges but these areas were particularly crowded and government guidelines overlooked.  We’d recommend Blackpool Zoo to anyone and everyone, young and old alike!  Thank you for a great day out."
Lovely day! ,"Had a great visit since the zoo has been back open, we visited for our grandsons birthday. Slightly more people than I expected but some good social distancing measures in place. Would go again"
Our go-to happy place,"Love this place, always lots to see, baby animals, clean park. Animals well cared for and popular with visitors"
Great visit to the zoo🐵🐒🦍🐶🐕🐩🐺,"We had a great time at the zoo. Usually i dont like zoos but at blackpool zoo, i had a great time. There are so many animals to see and things to watch. Would definetly reccomend going x"
Birthday - 14th July 2020.,"This is probably my third time returning to Blackpool Zoo, under different circumstances due to C19. In regards to social distancing and safety, they had closed off small indoor areas, had arrows to encourage one way system, sanitiser points and a que to get into the busier areas. They handled it very well I think.I am 24, I came with my boyfriend and even after multiple visits this never gets old, even as I get older.I have been to zoo's in the past where its really quite depressing to see but this one is very nice in my opinion.Great gift shop, this zoo is great for all ages, amazing cafe and shop, friendly staff."
Staff are horrible and social distancing is terrible ,"Me and my family went on a day out for my sisters birthday. All was well until we went to the giraffes. I was taking pictures of the giraffes until a male came and stood shoulder to shoulder, knowing that social distancing was in place. A moment after a female came and pushed me out of the way and started screaming every name under the sun, bear in mind that there was young children around and I myself am 15. When I went to complain to staff that they should keep an eye out, they rolled their eyes as if they didn’t care that a 15 year old had just had their day spoiled by a adult. I then found out that she was “hunting” for me around the park, which spoiled my day even more. The majority of the staff are horrible to their visitors and the social distancing system they have in place is ridiculous."
Great zoo,"We visited just after the open after lockdown. It was our first time here and we will definitely be visiting again. The park was lovely, very clean and well laid out. Great range of animals and very clean and tidy. Excellent."
First visit since reopening ,"We had a lovely day out here today. One way system in place and plenty of hand sanitiser stations around the whole park. Cafe open for takeaway only at the moment, but plenty of socially distanced places to eat a picnic if you take your own, or buy one of the picnic bags from the cafe. Reptile house, aviary and inside areas not open yet, but there is still plenty to see and we had a great day. Looking forward to going back again soon once all areas are open. In lieu of keepers talks, there are 7 short podcasts available on your phone to access at points throughout the park. This was a nice touch  and provided some useful background, information on the animals being viewed. Might be worth downloading Podbean, or other podcast provider before arriving. There is a good little Blackpool Zoo App, which is worth downloading too, provides information and maps which adds to the enjoyment of the day, will help with the educational aspects of the day too."
Limited animals available,Was made aware online and telephone the zoo is open as usual even with the current virus situation. On arrival it was noticeable that half the animals weren't out and all the houses /pens were closed there was next to nothing for the young children to do feel robbed!
Excellent visit with a toddler ,"We visited Blackpool zoo as a family (2 adults and a toddler). Note under 3s free entry. We used tescos clubcard vouchers to pay. Parking - large Carl park available (pay and display).Zoo - excellent many animals, children areas, parks, eating areas etc. Cafe on-site serving hot and cold drinks. Lots of animals and enclosures, use the site map to navigate so you don’t miss anything. Will visit again."
Vile,"Used to come here around 10 times a year. However just got back today. Our first visit of 2020. Untidy, no hand sanitiser and hardly any monkeys. Changing the section when the monkey's roam free time only birds was a big mistake. My children ages 14, 5 and 2 were so so bored"
Brilliant sunshine and half price,"I visited the zoo on Sunday it felt like half of Blackpool also visited! The car park was packed and cost £3. Admission was very quick and we were soon walking around the newly improved dinosaur walk,  I loved this. Felt like I was in Jurassic park! Then onto the new elephant enclosure much nicer than the previous enclosure.  We saw loads of animals, they all looked happy and had plenty of space.  The whole place seemed much better than when I last visited and its obvious that improvements are still being made. Had a great day out."
Good day out,"Have been to Blackpool Zoo many times but not left a review its a good day out its smaller than Chester zoo so easier on the legs not as far to walk between enclosures actually saw the red panda which i have yet to see at chester.Love the Giraffe house. Entry price is reasonable and cheaper to book online.Was not too impressed with the cafe, dirty cups alongside clean ones not much choice in food left, toilets were dirty too.Gift shop have good selectionOnly gripe was having to pay £3  to park luckily hubby had some change on him, no mention of parking fee when i booked online unless i missed it."
Needs revamp,"Beautiful well cared for animals. The keepers are clearly devoted and very knowledgeable about their charges. The enclosures and surrounding areas need bringing up to scratch. Didn't feellike some of the bigger animal had enough room or any stimulation. Ditch the plastic dinoaurs and spread out the animals. Be nice to see some careful planting, and a lick of paint."
"Not impressed at being charged £3.00 parking fee, when other zoo's don't","My husband and I decided to come here for a day out, we normally go to Chester Zoo which is very similar in price but a far larger and superior zoo than here. But we thought, it would be nice to try this zoo out, however it was a bit much that unlike Chester Zoo which is free to park up we had to pay £3.00 here in Blackpool?? Its pushing it a little when Chester is far bigger and more to see!! Come on Blackpool Zoo, we nearly jut drove off as we had nothing but debit cards and the parking meters don't take cards?? In this day and age you are just going to put people off and lose customers. Get rid of your parking fees and you will have more people wanting to come here."
wonderful,"The zoo was clean and the animals enclosures were large and well kept, no animals looked distressed or unhappy, they all looked very relaxed and well looked after"
Aardvark Experience ,"Visited the zoo for an Aardvark experience. Had a lovely day out. As part of the experience we got free admission to the zoo. It was a lovely zoo with plenty to see and do. It was easy to navigate thanks to clear signage. The animals all had plenty of space in their enclosures and looked well cared for.As for the experience, it was great. Our keeper was Harry Handford who was knowledgeable, fun, and friendly. The aardvarks all woke up to be fed and all enjoyed a lot of fuss and antention.Would definitely visit again."
Fantastic Zoo for all the family ,"I couldn't recommend this place enough! It's a lovely zoo with lots of animals to see, really close up too and you feel like its close together but still giving the animals a good space. Lots of little undercover areas and inside parts as we went on a pouring day, we still managed to see everything and enjoy it. Very friendly staff and a good play area for the kids. Feeding talks and sea lion shows are really enjoyable too for my 5 year old and 15 year old too! Cheaper than other zoos, more close up and a great day out. I was also impressed with the first aid team response to an incident that occurred with my son too."
Very impressive,"The zoo is amazing, it exceeded all our expectations. Our only disappointment was the weather, totally out of their control. It poured with rain and blew gales for the entire visit. It didn’t seem to spoil the day for our 7 and 4 year old grandchildren. It’s very well set out, the animals all looked content with their surroundings, and it was all very clean. Any staff we came across were helpful and informative. We would love to come back in the summer to enjoy the lovely surroundings."
Wonderful Zoo,"I really enjoyed Blackpool zoo. One of my favourites. There is a great variety of animals who all have pleasant enclosures and the pathways and nice and clear, easy to walk around.You can't miss the amazing sea lion display or the lorikeets!"
Excellent place excellent service,"I go regularly to the zoo and it's always a lovely day out. There's lots to see and do, including places to eat, but you have the option to bring your own food to save money which is very good of the zoo to allow you to eat your own food on their premises. It's really good value for money. Recently I booked an experience to meet the penguins for my partners birthday, I haven't done this before and the experience isn't until August, as it was quite booked up, but I'm sure it'll be an amazing opportunity. It's nice the zoo allows you to interact. Would like to say how lovely Marie is, who went above and beyond to send out a gift voucher for the experience for my partner to open on his birthday, rather than simply viewing an email. Overall and amazing zoo with lovely staff. Definitely recommend for everyone."
january in the rain,"my wife and I decided on the spur of the moment to spend a weekend in Blackpool. and have a day at the zoo. it was , as I said January it was very wet and windy we got there at just after opening time ( the cashier said we were the second people in ) so there were no mad crowds to fight against. we got not bad views of most of the animals the cafe was ""bloody expensive"" at £9:50 for two cups of coffee and two biscuits. we missed most of the keeper talks apart from the penguins just through bad timing on our part it rained the whole way round but we still enjoyed it"
Curious,"Although I have been to many zoo's over the years I was curious to know what type Blackpool was so on an overcast day last summer my husband and I went along. Not the biggest or best that I have ever visited but a pleasant experience. Reasonably priced for entrance, the animals looked happy enough and it was clean. A lovely walk (I struggle) but lot's of places to rest. The Wolves were amazing."
Blackpool Zoo,Fabulous day out with our 9 year old.  Loads to see and do once inside. Animals looked well looked after
"Good zoo, Lakeside cafe needs sorting out, long queues, cold food","Visited again today as our 6 year old Grandson said he wanted a day at the zoo. It was a bright but bitterly cold day and the zoo was busy. We booked online and remembered to take £2.50 for parking. The zoo itself is great, well looked after animals and nice and compact to get round but the catering certainly needs sorting out. The coffee shop at the entrance was closed as was every other around the zoo, the only one open and that was only half open was the Lakeside Cafe. The queues were long and a table if you could get one was left full of the previous occupants dirty pots and food. Whilst my Husband queued up I cleared pots and cleaned the table, luckily I had wet wipes in my bag. My Husband and I had jacket potato with cheese and beans my Grandson had sausage, chips and beans, the food was stone cold making it inedible. Surely on a busy Saturday whoever manages this cafe should have both sides open and hot food available, also staff working who can clear and clean tables. I don’t mind paying if the food is edible but it’s annoying once you are in the zoo and relying on this cafe to eat lunch when they can’t provide a hot meal. That said we enjoyed our day but come on Blackpool Zoo sort the catering out!"
"Lions, tigers, (no) bears... oh my!","Took my son on Saturday because they have a dinosaur safari. That was fun 😃The dinosaurs are good, the rest of the zoo was better. It was over cast and a little cold, so most of the animals were inside. However, you can still see them.The animals look a lot healthier than an other zoo I went last year.Bring some change because its £2.50 parking... under the guise of charity. Booking in advance is cheaper at £18.99 per adult.Twas a fun day though 😃"
Zoo experience and a fantastic family day out,"We visited the zoo at the end of January for a junior keeper experience for my daughter. It was fantastic and I'd highly recommend it. The zoo is well maintained and with friendly staff.My daughter fed several animals from penguins and anteaters to giant tortoises, camels and perhaps the best ones- lemurs (which climbed up on you) and the giraffes (so beautiful to see close up)The keepers were very knowledgeable and helpful and showed us around the zoo.The elephant house was outstanding and the highlight of the day. The cafeteria was reasonable and the souvenir shop worth a visit at the end.I'd recommend arriving when the zoo opens so you get more chance to see the active animals."
"Cracking day out, as always.","Really enjoy it here, was disappointed to find a couple of the exhibits closed but these things have to happen in order for improvements. Took around 3 hours to walk round & had a brilliant time."
Great day out,Lovely zoo. Great friendly staff.  Spaced out. Plenty to see and do.  Great play ground for a little time out and plenty of space for a picnic.
Lovely day out at the zoo,We were very pleasantly surprised with the zoo. We went with our 2 children who are 2 years old and 8 months old. The zoo was nice and small and easy to get around with our double buggy. Enough for our children to look at. We would definitely return
Great fun for the full family ,Great fun for all the family love seeing all the animals and the shows they put on are fantastic! I’ve been many times over the years with my family and will definitely be back.
Rick H,Visited today with the grandchildren my wife is in a wheelchair All the site very accessible and staff really helpful
Good vist,We visited for something to do over christmas and new year. We saw most of the animals on the map and had a good time looking round. The zoo was quite busy however we didnt seem.tonsee many staff and had to wait a good ten minutes to get into the zoo. The zoo is out in an easy to follow route and there is also a 'farm' part where children can touch the animals. We didnt watch any of the talks or feedings we just wondered round looking and watching the animals. Alot of the food huts were shut as was the railway due to it being winter which is understandable. We had a good vist and enjoyed it but will probably wait till the summer to vist again so everything is open.
Great zoo,"Enjoyed a few hours here over Christmas. Sealion show was great, and seeing the Gorillas being fed. Having to pay for parking is a bit of a rip off though, £2.50, considering you also are paying to get in the zoo"
Playful animals,It's not huge but it's a lovely place. Animals are playful and brisk. I had a lovely date with my partner there :)
Recommended,Visited the zoo with 5 year old grandson. He loved every minute.  The animals were very well kept and were very close. The sea lion demonstration was very entertaining and informative. Visit to Santa was very brief but grandson loved the present of the pink flamingo! Cafe food was disappointing. Ice creams very lovely even on a very cold day!
Great ,Great day out if you have the weather . The children loved all the animals  and loved watching the animals at feeding times .
amazing,"blackpool zoo is amazing , so much to see and do the tiger comes right up to the fence you can watch them being fed its loverly"
Santa’s Grotto was Terrible,Not magical at all and not well done. Even my 3 year old said Santa looked bored!!!Could have been a lot better.
Day out,"The day we went it was very busy but we didn't have to queue for long as the staff were very quick to get everyone through.Plenty of animals to see but the reptile house has gone which was a shame and the train wasn't running either. £19.50 per adult is a bit steep, but we all had a good time."
A day at the zoo,Fantastic place grandkids very excited all the animals were great monkeys kids never stopped laughing fed the parrots with nectar dinosaur walk list goes on to much to mention fantastic and all animals looked as they are all cared for very well definitely go back in the summer though Blackpool in November very cold
One of the best zoos in England!,Easily! We always forget just how much we love Blackpool Zoo until we get here. If you get the resort pass you can get cheaper tickets and honestly this is a full day zoo where something like Woburn I would place as a half day experience.
Santa trip 2019,"Kids really enjoyed meeting ""the real santa "" at the zoo on the 1st December and loved meeting the animals as usual. They spent a while hunting a runaway elf that had gone AWOL and they have added there gifts from santa to their ever growing collection of soft zoo animals"
Trip with young children to see santa as well as the animals,Very much improved since my last visit 4 years or so ago. Very child friendly and interactive. Able to get close to the animals and an excellent variety of species. The seagulls caused the young children a few problems but not really the zoo's fault. Great for a variety of ages.
Great Day Out,What a great day out this was. The animals are really well cared for and it is well layed out. well worth a visit.
Couple of days in Blackpool ,We found the Zoo good value for money. Plenty of places to eat and get a drink. The seal show was excellent we really enjoyed this while learning alot about their behaviours. The zoo as a wide variety of different species to see.
Blackpoo zoo,"Really enjoyed our visit, the zoo is not as big as others, however easy to navigate and the animals are great"
great zoo,"This is a lovely zoo with caring keepers. The enclosures are spacious and its easy to go round, no complicated maps or routes. We took our own food and had plenty of space to eat. Well worth a visit for 2020 in my opinion ! :)"
Worth a visit!,"Great zoo!! My first with my grandson and family, staff friendly and very clean. Restaurant a bit expensive but food was good."
Fantastic place to visit.,"Blackpool Zoo is the place to visit. We went on Wednesday 13th November 2019. We went in and hired a wheelchair for the day which came in very handy. The staff are so helpful. We spent over 4 hours in the zoo. We have been to chester zoo, but on comparison I say Blackpool zoo is by far better.To go to see the elephants in there house or enclosure you do need to have a mobility scooter with you. I found it very hard pushing my partner in the wheelchair, up to the elephant house. The food in the cafe was very good and reasonably priced, the staff are very helpful and very polite which is very rare these days. The zoo and walkways are very clean. We booked it online and the lady in reception printed our tickets for us. The price with car parking was £20.00 for us. Which for a lovely day out was good. The food was £12.50 for 2 meal deals. So for £32.50 was a good deal. We will be going again but next time during the summer. We so enjoyed the sealion show, it was informative and the sealion enjoyed it as well."
Lovely zoo,"Nice mid size zoo, the enclosures all very good, especially the new elephant enclosure   It rained for us but it didn't take away our enjoyment,"
Visit with a 4 & 8 year old.,I brought my two boys here for the day. From start to finish the boys loved every moment of this. There is plenty to see and the shows and information they were given about the animals was great. We will defo be visiting again in the future.
Absolutely fantastic,"Blackpool zoo is the best zoo that we've visited and will be going again and again. Outstanding children's play areas, well spaced out, lots of little huts and private picnic area's, and viewing points. A vast array of animals, which you can clearly see close up. The silverback gorilla is our particular favourite. I have never known a zoo to have so many animals. Regular feeding shows and ramps to all areas, so wheelchair friendly. Nice eating places, clean toilets, and a good gift shop. Good value for money and a must see for all ages."
Ordered tickets via Tesco Clubcard vouchers used app charged more admission,"Used Tesco Clubcard vouchers as usual, used app on phone charged me extra £14 entrance fee on arrival, so rather pointless using my saved vouchers, complained said it was rules. Done this numerous times over the years never had this problem before, won’t be going back again as felt rather cheated by this as we chose going there because of the Tesco voucher scheme hope this review  avoids this  happening to somebody else in the future."
Great day out,"We had a lovely day at Blackpool zoo we saw lots of animals and felt they were well cared for, the staff we spoke to were very helpful and pleasant. We also ate in the cafe and found the food to be good value and very nice. The only things I would say the zoo needs is a covered picnic area as my Dad who had brought a picnic tried to eat his sandwhich walking round and a seagull took it out of his hand."
Still a great zoo,"This really is a great zoo. Really well laid out and fantastic shows, throughout the day.The Sea Lion show is a highlight.four stars as I still think the pricing is a little high, but still a great day."
Great day at the Zoo,I went to the Zoo on Saturday and caught the number 20 bus from the centre of Blackpool which drops you off and picks you up right outside the Zoo. Although the weather wasn't particularly good I managed to see all the animals I had gone to see and I got to see the tiger and the lions being fed so that was a real bonus for me.I had lunch in the Lakeside cafe which was really nice and reasonably priced.All in all a really enjoyable day.
Magnificent,"New enclosures, healthy and entertained residents, good range of interaction events and knowledgeable, approachable staff made this a great day out"
Weekend in blackpool,"Very busy carpark but found somewhere obviously you have to pay, reception staff are a little unhelpful as my mother in law was a carer  and should have got a discount for this but they were in too much of a rush to give it, anyway zoo itself is good plenty of benches to sit etc, cafe, ice creams, took my father in law who was in a wheel chair and managed okay getting around etc, some slopes can be steep, i would recommend this zoo as a day out"
Lovely,Really nice zoo. Nothing special but a really nice day out. You can see all the animals and grab a bite to eat in around 4 hours. Only a ten minute drive from the main strip.
Great place for familys,"We have been to this zoo a few times now and always enjoyed it here.There are plenty of things to do here, the park is very clean and staff are very helpful.The play area next door is great aswel for £1.75 with a zoo recipt and well worth the money for a play area.We will most certainly look forward to visiting you in the near future."
"Zoo fine, visit spoilt by other guests.","Elephant house is great, lovely to see them being challenged to find ways to get to the food.  Saw newly arrived male. Most animals visible, lions, tigers, giraffes, numerous monkeys. Orangutan's and gorilla were playful as ever!  New lorikeet area was nice. They do fly on to you and are not afraid to give you a gentle bite! Penguin pool not very clear. Clear they have worked on trying to ensure areas are not slippy. Largely successful. Sadly our visit was spoilt by a family that think it was acceptable to have a go at our disabled son and his mum for getting too close to their son. May be if they supervised better. Our son then continually requested to go to the car (his way of saying he wants to leave) on his communication device. So we curtailed our visit, missing areas and not stopping at others anywhere near as long as normal."
Nice zoo ,Came here to celebrate my little boys 4th birthday and blackpool zoo is a nice zoo.It offers better value for money than chesterzoo but dont feel I missed anything.Throught the train price was expensive so didnt go on. But a really nice zoo with a good layout.
Expensive and unkempt,"This zoo was determined to charge yoy through the nose for everything. As if the entry fee wasn't enough, parking is £2.50 on top (I'm sure they'd argue it was to encourage you to use publuc transport), you then have to navigate TWO soft play centres (both of which are extra) and once inside the little train which covers half the zoo is another £2.50 per person. Now you don't hve to do all these things but kids nag and most places I've been before tend to include a little soft play and train ride in the ticket price.The place looked tired although the outdoor aviary and the Lorikeets were lovely. Would be useful to have been told on entry that the Lorikeets weren't open until 1pm though! All in all an expensive and below average day."
Visit ,Love this place Meals in the cafe were reasonably priced Paying for parking on top of the entrance fee I thought was a bit off .
Family day out,"Visited today for the first time. Easy to find but was shocked when we arrived to find we had to pay for parking on top of the entrance fee.Lots of animals to see and the zoo is nicely laid out and very clean and tidy. Animal enclosures are a good size and all animals looked well cared for. Enjoyed the talks and watching the animals been fed.One big issues the zoo has is the vast amount of seagulls,there is signs up saying dont feed but even if you are just walking around these can swoop at anytime my hubby was nearly knocked out by one and he was only walking past one of the food outlets and he didn't have any food on him!! Hate to think what may have happened should we have been having a picnic.Overall a good visit but seagulls are a pain"
A lovely day out,"Blackpool zoo is one of the nicest zoos I have visited. Its well set out and well sign posted for visitors.There are lions, tigers, elephant, zebra and camels and much more.Shows and talks are going on through the day. For an additional fee you can be a zoo keeper for the day and feed some of the residents!Car parking is £2.50 for the day but that didn't upset us.Cafe wasn't too expensive and toilets were clean. I also found the gift shop quite reasonable. My 4 year old grandson enjoyed the experience of being able to see the animals quite close up. Thumbs up for Blackpool zoo! We'll definitely visit again."
Great day out,"We visited with our one year old and he just loved every second - especially seeing the giraffes! A lovely, well-kept zoo, decent restaurant and the lovely weather helped too! There is plenty to see and the talks are interesting too. We would go back."
Day out,Brilliant day out. Two kids boy 10 girl 13 really enjoyed it. Ten year old loved the dinosaur safari. Food in cafe was ok saved money by booking admission and food online. Highly recommend.
What a fab zoo!!,What can I say apart from the queue being long to get in everything else was great!! Really clean. Loved watching the apes being fed.the seal show was really good and managed to get a seat ok. Spent whole day here we all had lots of fun.highly recommend
Seagull nightmare,"This was our first visit to the zoo for many years, we visited with our two grandsons (5 & 4 yrs) , it is what it says on the tin. Elephants, lions, sealions etc. A little tired in places and in need of some TLC.The thing that is a major concern is that as we entered the zoo we stopped outside the cafe at the picnic area to get sandwiches out for the boys, only to be attacked by around 30 huge seagulls. Resulting in me sustaining a nasty cut to my hand and the two boys being absolutely terrified for the entire visit. There are signs up telling people no to feed the seagulls, but nothing that points out the consequences of eating in this area. We spoke to some of the zoo staff who were well aware of the issues with these flying robbers. The zoo website has the cute line :-""Please be aware that as we are located by the sea, there is a presence of seagulls that may want to join your picnic""No mention of the problem on their Facebook page at all.Sorry Blackpool Zoo, this is not good enough, you need to actually warn people of the actual dangers, remove the picnic benches, provide more covered eating areas."
Aardvard Experience - Brilliant,"Teen son had aardvark experience - 30mins with the aardvarks and a keeper. He absolutely loved it - even though the aardvarks napped half the time he was with him, he was able to sit and pet them and talk with the keeper about them. Keeper was amazing. Zoo is great too - sea lion show is the best we have ever seen."
Good place to visit for a birthday.,"The zoo has very good transport links with the 20 bus from Blackpool Tower.Very good value for money, we got to see all animals.The wolf enclosure especially was really good, you can access all parts of the zoo very easily.Can't wait until next year (next visit to Blackpool) to visit again."
great day out,"very good value for money , we got to see all the animals , the park was very wheelchair friendly , and plenty of places to eat and drink around the zoo , shop was very good for money ."
Humiliated at the pay kiosk,"Visited the zoo on the 23rd October.on reaching the payment area my wife noticed there was an additional discount for disabled patrons.On enquiring about the aforementioned I was greeted with a smirk,was wearing my dark glasses and then produced my white cane and yet again was greeted with the self same smirk.On the third time of asking the response was ""have you any identity "".This person Caitlin definitely needs some customer empathy coarse immediately. After being totally humiliated I tried to put the whole episode behind and enjoy the day."
A little break from Blackpool,"A lovely little oasis, gets packed with school children so go early, plenty of animals and feeding times, for ten pounds you can feed the animals, disappointed that there were no snakes but all the normal zoo animals are there, felt a bit pricey to get in but nice for a treat."
Enjoyable day out,"Really good Zoo, easy access to everything.  Clean and tidy, plenty of toilets.  Interesting information given about the animals throughout the day.  Sea Lion show is a must. Parking cost £2.50 for the day which we didn't expect."
cracking zoo,well run animals well cared for and plenty of room and easy access for all types young old or infirm you can see the lot
Great day out. ,Great day out for all the family. We Loved all the shows that were on through out the day. From the birds to the sea lions.
Decent day out!,We went with our 1yr old daughter. All 3 of us enjoyed it especially the sea lion show which was fun to watch. I’d recommend going 1st thing when the park opens at 10am as it was very quiet and easy to navigate around the park and see all the different animals and attractions. Have to pay for parking which is a bit of a downer considered the price to enter the park but isn’t the end of the world though and it’s old school only accepts change so bear that in mind. Good day all round though.
Great for younger children,Not too big to walk around.  My grandaughter enjoyed the dinosours and we loved the shows/talks that happen through out the day with the animals.Lots of places to picnic and a park for children.
Trip to the zoo.,The family had a trip to the zoo while in blackpool as we heard good things so decided to take a chance and go. There were lots of things to do while at the zoo for example the shows that are put on for you which include the big cats and dinosaur shows and there are loads more at specific times through out the day. The one that we did go and see was the sea lion show which was good and recommend when there. We also strolled around seen loads of animals including a angry lion up close which was great. The park is wide open to walk around as well and sign posted well to the animals and a map and times of the shows are given to you when entering the zoo. We also had a bite to eat in the cafe while there which was reasonable and the portion size is big as well. When in Blackpool I would definitely say it's worth a trip to see it.
Blackpool zootropilis ,"We had a great time at this zoo, it cost £18.99 per adult and £14.50 for children 3-15,some may think this is expensive however the zoo is beautiful and kept to a high standard. There is plenty to see and do and food is not overpriced."
Having to pay to park after extortionate entry price.,Arrived at zoo to find £2.50 to park. After paying £50 to enter is a joke! Trying to get you for every penny!
Great family day out,"Went with 2 young toddlers and we all had a great day. You can easily spend a good few hours or all day here there’s plenty to see and do. We watched the sea lion show and it was fantastic. We loved seeing all the animals and we did see them all. The lions and giraffes were the kids favourite. There’s a kids play area outside too and it’s really good and also a farm for the kids to see too . The Wallaby walkabout area is good, kangaroos jumping around freely around you is nice to see. It’s bigger than I expected . Only bad point I have is the cafe fast food was a bit rubbish for price. If i went again I’d choose the other side (the canteen bit with proper food rather than the burger/hotdog fries side as it wasn’t so nice) ... all in all though I’d Defo recommend and go again ."
Fabulous Zoo,What an absolutely amazing day out. I could not belive how close you are to all the animals. They had all the top animals you'd expect to find at a Zoo. There were regular feeding times and the keepers gave regular talks about the individual animals. The sea lions gave an amazing show. It is by far one of the best zoo's I've ever had the pleasure to visit
One of the best zoos in the country!!,"We come to Blackpool Zoo every year, simply because each time we leave with a different experience that lingers in our minds. This year it was how close we got to the lions 😱 you can get close to all the animals there and the staff are friendly. The cafe is reasonably priced too!"
A trip to the zoo. ,"What a brilliant day out. We’ve been wanting to visit this zoo since we saw the garden makeover program which was on TV. We spend 7 hours here and didn’t get bored one bit. The zoo is quite big but still managed to get around and see everything. There was shows and things to do for kids. The staff were professional and very very knowledgeable. We did 2 experiences, the first was stroking the sea lions and the other was feeding the giraffes. Would highly recommend this Zoo to everyone."
A great family day out.,"We have visited this zoo several times before and always had a good time but felt this time i should really leave a review to let others know what a good day this is. We visited today after a problem visiting last month (our fault). The staff both then and now were lovely to deal with and helped us re book our tickets. The day we choose to visit was unfortunately a very rainy day but what a good day we had despite the rain! The staff we encountered were cheerful and knowledgeable. The park is well set out and clean, safe for the children to run free and explore a little. We ate in the main canteen the food was reasonably priced and the staff again were helpful and kind. A good place to visit, it was really lovely to see my young children excited to see the animals :)"
Sea Lion is a must watch,"I am really impressed with Sea Lion show, friendly staff and they gave loads of information which i was not aware previously"
Interesting,A nice day out seeing many animals that are near extinct. A pleasure that someone is  take of them.Not easy to get to on public transport is the only problem for none car owners.
Fantastic day out,"Visited Blackpool zoo with wife and daughter, had a brilliant day, wife is in a wheelchair and we got around to see all the zoo with no problems at all definetly wheelchair and disabled friendly. Even though wife has own wheelchair we did notice on way in that you can hire a wheelchair to get around the zoo which I think is great as a lot of places Don,t. Plenty of animals to see and you get enough information regarding the zoo to help you plan your journey around the zoo. Staff very pleasent and helpful and took time to answer any questions we had on the animals. Definetly worth a visit as it's a brilliant day out and we would definetly go back."
A Great Day Out,"Visited this zoo on 19th September 2019.We had an excellent day. Being midweek and term time it was not too busy. We were amazed how close you could get to some of the exhibits. Especially the big cats, Elephants and Giraffes. Feeding times were spaced nicely and in an order that you are not backwards n forwards over the same areas time n again.Would reccomend this attraction for Anyone to visit n not just families. As a disabled gentleman I found all areas to be fully accessible throughout the zoo."
Fantastic laid out Zoo,"This has got to be by far the best zoo we have visited in the UK. Well laid out, plenty of room for the animals"
"Blackpool Zoo, Great Day out","Spent a few days in Blackpool, decided to go to the zoo, haven't been since i was a child, it was great, the weather was dry and sunny and  spent over 3 hours there.The animals seemed well looked after, my favourite was the huge Lion and the Gorilla, for a small cost you could feed the Giraffe, the outdoor cafe, is not to expensive. I booked my tickets online to save a pound or two. Would recommend"
Good Day Out,"Not the cheapest attraction if taking a family but big enough for a full-day trip without the need to rush from pen to pen, while mostly on the flat. Some animals looke somewhat lonely, e.g. only one zebra (?) and one ostrich (?) but the aviaries, apes and kangaroos/wallabies make up for it.All in all, value for money and, if the weather holds, a good day out. If you want more, cross over the road to Stanley Park and its attractions.Blackpool Transport buses run a regular service from a stop close to the Tower and will drop you at the Zoo entrance."
Day trip to Blackpool Zoo,During a week in Blackpool forecast for rain we picked a dry day to visit Blackpool Zoo. Used Tesco vouchers so it was cheapish day out. Shopping the shop with my grand daughter made up for that. Well laid out Zoo and we managed to fit in most of the feeds and shows. Would certainly go back.
Good day out?,"Great zoo, great shows, plenty of picnic areas. Really enjoyable day, only thing that let it down was no mobility scooters available, they only have wheel chairs. But I coped. Would definitely recommend this zoo to everyone. Book online for discount and also quicker entrance. Take your own picnic. Loved the place."
Pleasantly surprised,"What a great place.  Design is great, with brilliant viewing areas to see the animals up close.  Very clean everywhere.  We were surprised by the number of animals, including elephants, lions, gorillas, giraffes.  Everywhere easily accessible by wheelchair.  Free wheelchair hire, which my elderly mum greatly appreciated.  A great day out.  I would visit again."
Super day ,Great day at the zoo with friends .. the zoo is looking fab and it really was great fun... we are all photographers and loved it from that point of view ... also we had some food which for a zoo was a decent price and really tasty ... burgers were really nice .. can’t wait to return
Great visit ,We had a great day at Blackpool zoo. Fun for all the family lots to see staff where helpful nice hot chocolate at the cafe too
Good day out,"We took our 3 grandchild aged 9, 12 and 14 to the zoo. It has been much improved and upgraded since my last visit about 10 years ago.There is a good selection of animals including lions, tigers, elephants penguins and seals to name a few.It was a beautiful day so the zoo was packed. I would advise taking a picnic lunch as the queues I saw for food were long.There are a few picnic areas around the zoo with plenty of tables.We tried to get in to the sealion show but all the seating was taken.Please note those with prams had to leave them outside the enclosure. Ticket prices were very reasonable (cheaper if you book online). You are able to use Tesco vouchers to pay for tickets.There is a very good play area with seating.Also a bus goes from the street by the Tower to the Zoo.All in all it was a good day out, even oir 14yr old enjoyed it."
Great for e the whole family,A great day out lots of interesting animals to see pity the rain kept a few indoors a well kept zoo and staff very helpful and informativeP
Excellent zoo,"We only had a couple of hours here but what we saw was excellent. Well cared for animals in well maintained enclosures. I have never seen zoo animals so happy, interactive and displaying natural behaviour in any other zoo. Shame we couldn’t have stayed longer - will be back 😀"
Fantastic,"A fantastic day out at Blackpool Zoo, despite the weather! Loads for all ages to enjoy. The animals appear very well looked after and content. Plenty of choices for food /drink etc at reasonable prices. The entire day was grand from start to finish and would love to come back for another visit. Dino land was loved by all. Brilliant!!!"
Penguin Encounter ,"We visited the zoo to have an encounter with the adorable Magellanic Penguins, and couldn’t recommend it highly enough. Excellent customer care/service from all staff, and out keeper Jess made our experience really unique. We loved it. We helped clean the ‘penguin beach’, and feed them too! Including hand-feeding a cheeky little one stealing herring from the bucket! The encounter comes with entry to the park, a goody bag, free parking and a tea and biscuits voucher too."
Disappointing day out,"I booked a visit online to the zoo with my grandkids and family members which cost us £94.The rain was horrendous and we where only in the zoo about 20 minutes as it was near impossible to walk round as the pathways where like huge ponds of water,staff where lifting drains up and it was absolutely flooded in some places,there was hardly any animals to see as they where all inside sheltering from the wet.We where all totally drenched so went to the desk to tell them it was impossible to get round the pathways and couldn't see most of the animals.I enquired about a refund as we had booked online and did not know what the weather was going to be like when we booked otherwise I wouldn't have wasted all that money.I was told there was nothing they could do,I explained to them that in most places it was impossible to get round and they still said there's nothing they could do.I would have been happy with a partial refund or some vouchers for another time. I will not visit the zoo again because of this and think it's shocking the way they just blatantly said there's nothing they can do."
Fantastic day out,"Really good zoo well laid out and good amenities, much better than Chester zoo. The zoo is really clean and animals seem really well cared for. Good reasonably prices cafes."
The kids had a brilliant time ,"The kids had a brilliant time, we traveled down for my 6 years old birthday, we will be coming back next year."
Love it ,Not much to say lovely staff good prices lots to see and do a fantastic day out and will be going again in the future
"Very good attraction,","An excellent attraction, but like most attractions in Blackpool it has become very expensive, but at least you could spend many hours in here."
Brilliant day out!!!,Go early and get a full day. It's fantastic!! So much to see and do for all ages!!! It's very roomy and you never feel that the quality of provision for the  animals is compromised in any way. It's easy to walk round. Everything signposted efficiently. Take a picnic there are plenty of seated eating areas. We had lovely weather which may have helped but we took our 3 year old granddaughter who absolutely loved it. I would definitely recommend!!
Managed to great photos of gorillas and lions,Loved it .not too far to walk and see all animals helpful staff.and great information boards to help you
Great day out but ,"Blackpool zoo is a great day out and by far one of the best small zoos.  Enclosures are large and seal pool is great.  Now for the but and this is something that the zoo staff can help with when it comes to accessible visitors. We have a wheelchair user and the zoo is very accessible. Unfortunately and the best example is in the seal show arena. Entire front row us for access users and yet it quickly filled up with people that we heard say, let's just sit here and we can move if required. Guess what the stadium filled up and the spaces were required they didn't move so wheelchairs had to leave the show despite if people bunched up there could have been room . People's attitudes to disabled folk is often questionable and we are met with resentment regularly but this ignorance has to be managed. Not all disabilities are obvious and nor all are physical but for those that are ,it's clear that Blackpool zoo need to better manage this seating as the same happened at the bird display.  Otherwise a great day out."
Best zoo,This is the best zoo I’ve been to in years we managed to spend the whole day there literally from it opens till it closed its easy to work your way around with the map lots of animals there were a couple of no showed but as the day was getting in we went back to the ones we missed and seen them so we actually seen all the animals which was a first for us at any zoo there are plenty of seating arias and toilets. I can’t comment on the price of food as we brought our own in due to these places usually being overpriced or large cues. But as I said plenty of seating and bins. It is a brilliant family day out I would highly recommend and look forward to returning
Great day out,"Highly recommend this zoo. Lots to see, lots for little kids too which helps as my grandson is 20months."
Always a fun visit,"We’ve been to Blackpool Zoo about six times now and it never lets us down. Always a lovely visit and it was especially lovely to see the baby capybaras this year, absolutely beautiful. The new attraction rainbow landings made my day, for only a pound you can feed rainbow lorikeets which was a really fun and unique experience!! The wallaby walkthrough is also another favourite area!"
Tired unkept grounds,I was disappointed the grounds looked tired and unloved.too few animals. However my grandson was in awe of the dinosaur forest. the seal enclosure was excellent.
Family trip to the zoo,"I booked online for myself, partner and 2 month old baby, prices were reasonable and we bought the burger deals so we could eat inside rather than take food inside. We arrived at 2pm and was seen to very quickly, the park is very lovely and we had a amazing day seeing all the animals and found there was plenty of space to sit nearby if needed to with a small baby. We went for food with our vouchers and there was a massive queue and they only had 2 staff serving and 2 behind making the food so you can imagine the wait.... the food was not very nice for the price as I saw one couple spend over 22 pounds just on food 😳 We headed to the seal show for 4pm and was told to sit outside due to no prams allowed for health and safety reasons, I felt this was discrimination as wheelchair users were allowed in? If I had a older child I would of been more then happier but how do they accommodate parents taking young babies into the complex? If there was a risk wouldn't it be better pushing a Pram out rather than carrying my baby in a carry cot where people would try and rush and push past me if there was a evacuation? A wheelchair again would be same as more than likely someone is pushing the person. So not only myself but other who had young children who were unable to walk were pushed out to watch from the outside. It really put a negative on our day and wanting to visit again."
Visted last week,A lovely day was spent at the Zoo. The pathways are very clean and the animal areas are clean and well kept. Plenty of room to view the animals and I spent a lovely time feeding the birds.
Amazing ,"Wow!! Went for my nephews 4th birthday and he was excited to see the animals but also do the dinosaur walk. Even after showing him in the months running up to it, we didnt realise they had some animated dinosaurs  - this was just the icing on the cake for him.  We all loved it (wife, son and his wife, 1yr granddaughter and myself on a mobility scooter). He kept running back and forth shouting out what the dinosaurs were when he seen them - probably could have left after this.The zoo itself is great. Very well laid out and so flat and very easily accessible (usually have a manual wheelchair but hired a scooter but felt comfortable that it would be an easy job for someone pushing the wheelchair! )The enclosures were fantastic and seeing such amazing animals was great. Favourites had to be elephants, gorillas and orangutan!! Although not a massive zoo you could spend all day there - I know we could have. Animal shows, encounters, plenty picnic areas.  Staff were great and patient - even when our nephew was gibbering away during a talk. This is very definitely a worth while visit and worth the price. Will be returning when back in the area."
Worth a visit,"My husband and I visited here whilst on holiday nearby. It is easy to find and as it's not a huge zoo, it does take all day to get round. We were there for just over 4 hours, which included having a Starbucks morning coffee and some lunch.The prices are reasonable in the shop and the cafe.There is a good variety of animals to see. Otters are my favourite animal, so I was pleased to be able to see them.The sea lion show is a must.Definitely worth a visit. The zoo is clean and tidy."
Expensive,"My wife and i were being charged £76.00 to get into the zoo until I pointed out to the girl on the till that I am sitting in an electric wheelchair her response was "" I didn't see you sitting in it"" I was sitting less than 3ft from her, the price was then reduced to £62.00. They even have the cheek to charge for parking. The food was also expensive and was not the best. Maybe that's why the zoo was empty too expensive."
Excellent,"Only expected to be there a couple of hours, but lasted all day. Think we were the last to leave.A fantastic place, much bigger than expected. Lots of animals to see.Gina the sea lion was the star of the place.Only downside was the cafe. Very disappointing selection.Can't wait to visit again."
Great Zoo and Great Day Out,"I remember coming here 25 years ago with my children, fast forward and here again with my grandchildren.Its a great day out and has enough species of animals to keep both children and adults amused.Great facilities with good eateries, all zoo staff seem to love their jobs with the animals and this shines through.Its a very safe environment and clean.Personally we loved the gorillas, elephants and of course the seals, there are great shows for the pubic to see.All in all a great day out."
A big improvement ,I went to Blackpool zoo with my family. Last time I attended the zoo. It looked like it had been left with over grown weeds and plants. It has had a good tidy up and they have changed some of the animal enclosures. The elephants are in a new enclosure. The elephant project is a good idea and I hope it goes well. It was a good few hours at the zoo well worth a visit.
Fun Day at Blackpool zoo,"It was a good day sunny but not too warm the animals were quite lively...Blackpool zoo is well worth a visit tigers lions, elephants,a farm area train,ice cream places,plenty of cafés much bigger then i thought you need a good 4 hrs."
Great zoo,Thoroughly enjoyed our recent trip to Blackpool zoo which has a fabulous selection of animals which were all eager to be photographed.Layout is good and great that it is all on the flat.Food wasn't too expensive and there was a decent selection too.Well worth spending a day here so you can see everything at a leisurely pace.
A nice little zoo - plenty to see!,"A small zoo, but larger than you may expect and with lots of things to see and do.  Plenty of kids, but also plenty for adults too!"
Fantastic zoo,"Fabulous zoo. Nice and clean, well kept, animals looked healthy. A good day out. Rather poor service and food in the cafe though."
Full day's visit,"Animals appeared healthy & relaxed, great to see the zoo investing in new facilities and phasing out the old, smaller enclosures. A day was filled exploring the whole site and listening to the talks. Biggest WOW was the new giraffe barn - no spoilers, but go into the barn at ground level first - before climbing up to head height. A literal wow from me. The zoo's audio system needs improving, though - the penguins talk was ruined as unable to make out a word - shame as Vicky (?) was great in the other talks I could hear her give. Also, the food offering is pretty dire if you don't want fish & chips, burger & chips or hot dog & chips. If you're a veggie, make sure you take something with you!"
Summer Visit,Me and my brother went for a day of doing something. We really enjoyed it. The tickets were reasonable and cheaper than Chester though there are less animals there. The park is easy to follow around and suitable for families. We were disappointed with the cafe; we expected the prices to be high but there was not a lot of choice.
The animals looked sad,Don't think the food was worth it alot of the animals looked sad or scared the weather was nice when we went
Very poor,Wouldn't recommend here at all...very over priced and very little to see... save your money...I do recommend Chester zoo...
Great Zoo,"Love it here, better than the other zoos we’ve been to.Animals clean and well looked after, keepers take good care of them and plenty of conservation support and education.Plenty of picnic areas and toilets, good value for money and well laid out.Only downside the Tiger showed stressful behaviour, tail down ,pacing round the perimeter.did not look happyBut that’s Zoos for you, without them many children would never see these beautiful animals.All in all  a five star attraction."
Wow! ,For a small zoo it's was amazing. Animals all look happy and well looked after. Very clean around the zoo too. Loved the dinosaurs. Will visit again
Fun,Had a really good time with our 2 grandchildren aged 4 and 2You get a map when you pay so its is easy to find your way around There is plenty to see and do as well as the good variety of animals with a couple of parks and plenty of food outlets which are reasonably pricedThere are also plenty of toilets that are well maintained Overall a great day out and definitely worth the price
Blackpool Zoo ,"This was my 2nd visit to Blackpool Zoo, & alot has changed in those 9 or 10 years!! Came with my aunt & we had a great afternoon!! So much to see & to experience animals so close is wonderful. Most people only ever see these animals on TV!! We got 50% discount tickets as we booked thru Blackpool Promotions. Was well worth it!! I absolutely love the addition of the otters...such a beautiful pair of wee show offs..!! My favourite experience of the day was getting the chance to feed & hold the beautiful Lorikeets...im not a huge fan of birds tbh, & i wasnt sure how id react to them flapping around me, let alone landing on me, but these little guys were amazing!! One took a shine to my bracelet & ring, & I thought id be losing then!! As myself & my aunt had full hands, the keeper very kindly took over photo duties!! I can honestly say this was one of the most amazing experiences of my life!! Now, a few wee complaints....ALL the tables outside the cafe were wobbly...I ended up wearing a lot of my Frozen Fanta...!! The Tiger....as beautiful as it was to see, the day we were there, the poor thing was pacing the same path, & it was quite distressing to see....Overall,  we had a wonderful day, & slightly better weather than the rest of the week!!"
Very confusing,"As expected the animals there are incredible and well worth the visit, but the layout is very confusing.We stopped in the resturant and the good was very lack luster and very expensive.Not only do you pay for entry into the zoo you also have to pay for parking which is not reimbursed.Overall not my favorite zoo"
Family visit,"Visited during the summer with sons - one with autism.  Proper organisation meant we saw almost all the animals, watched feeding times, listened to very informative talks throughout the day.  Took packed lunch - but cafe had plenty of choice -very busy mid summer. Watched entertaining sea lion display and enjoyed dinosaur safari! Took lots of pictures and learnt loads of interesting facts.  The Zoo has something for everyone.  My sons have Silver Membership passes - they go every week!  Absolutely brilliant way to spend a few hours!  Suits all ages too."
A great day out,"My partner and myself took my 3 year old,  grand-daughter to visit the zoo. We found it very interesting and enjoyable. The dinosaur area was amazing. My grand-daughter was amused by the howler monkey. We had a lovely day and can't wait to go again."
Blackpool trip.,"One of the best zoo's I have visited for along time,, well laid out good views of animals, well worth the entrance fee would highly recommend a visit, made a somewhat disappointing trip to Blackpool more bearable."
Tesco clubcard voucher trip,"I don't think the visit was worth the £47.99 it would've cost to go in but luckily we had purchased Tesco clubcard vouchers. However we did have to pay £8.99 because ""prices change"".We arrived at 10.15am and I would suggest arriving a little later as alot of the animals were asleep or not out in their enclosures. The food was quite expensive (£3.95 for a sandwich - a tiny triangle of ham and butter just on the edges, £6.50 for a chicken burger and fries).The highlights were: giraffes, gorillas, elephantsWe caught the train £1.50 single £2 return but it was quite speedy so we didn't get much chance to look at what we were passing. All in all not a bad day for £8.99 but we have been to better zoos for less"
Good day,Worth a visit. Well priced. Would recommend if in area. Cafe ok. Good day out with family. Would visit again
Great day,Came to visit the zoo with my partner and two young children who both loved it. There is plenty to do and see and also great because you can take in your own picnic. My two children loves it especially hearing the lions roar when they got some food brilliant day for the family my daughter who is 1 loved the sea lions and clapped along with them
Great value for the full day,Absolutely loved our family day out at Blackpool zoo.Very clean and fully staffed.The animals looked well and loved.Queue's were ok for food.The sealion show was great and the staff really concentrated on the kids and conservation.Fantastic day out for everyone and we all said we would return soon.Discount for localsThankyou
a smashing day out!!,visited this zoo on recent hotel break to blackpool excellent value bought our tickets from our hotel .so didnt have to que to get in plenty to do and see. plenty of places to sit down for anyone with mobility issues there also a little open top railway to get to other bits of the park.
Fantastic day at the zoo,We had a lovely day at the zoo today. Been many times. We wanted to see the new little birds and feed them however they closed this area very early (hours before the zoo closed) very disappointed with upset children. All other animals and displays were fantastic. The train was also closed. ☹️
Family visit to Blackpool Zoo,"We love animals so a trip to the zoo whilst in Blackpool, was a given. The zoo was average priced for a zoo but you did have to pay for the car parking, train and feeding animals (we usually get all this free at our usual zoo - Colchester, inc feeding giraffes and elephants). The animals looked happy and healthy. The sea lions were a bit amorous while we were there, putting on their own show haha! The dinosaur section was fun and we loved the flamingoes and deer. Great day out. Apparently you can use Tesco vouchers to get in and there’s a reduced ticket for the play centre next door but we didn’t get to try it."
Nice zoo,Lots of different animals to see. On the small side compared to Edinburgh zoo which is near where I stay.Lots of talks about the animals.Liked getting to feed the Lorikeet parakeets.Some of them sat on your hands without getting fed
“Tickle a Tapir” experience!,"We had a great day at Blackpool Zoo. We booked a “tickle a tapir” experience for my birthday and had really been looking forward to our visit. It was soo much better than we had expected, our tour guide Sophie did a fabulous job of making us feel really comfortable and answered all our questions. The Tapir’s were amazing and the experience was an amazing opportunity to feed and tickle them both. The experience price included a great goody bag with a certificate to remember our day! It also included our entrance fee into the park so we had a great afternoon walking around the zoo. It was a Saturday so very busy but we would definitely recommend a picnic as the cafe was heaving ALL day. There are lots of spaces to site and eat lunch in the shade & sunshine. We went to watch the Sealion Show which was sooo good. Really impressed with Sealions, their trainers and the presenter!!"
Well spread out,This is one of the best zoos I have visited. Loved the Lion Show and the Giraffe feeding. Gorilla here is super cute.
Very enjoyable ,Love coming here always enjoyable. So much to see and enjoy. It is a real pleasure coming here to see the animals and learn about how they live and interact. The price is reasonable and so is the food
It's a nice place to visit,"I've ever managed to spend a whole day here but I do love animals. There is lots to see and do for younger kids, the area is quite big and can get tired walking round. The maps are also not ever well designed as got lost a few times, there wasn't many staff around the time I went and it would be nice to have more talks about the animals. And the place would be a little cleaner in some areas. The place to eat could also do with some work and it could be better set out. Overall I'd go back as I love seeing animals and its worth it."
Better than I expected ,We visited here with our grand children (7 & 5) they absolutely loved it. Everything about it was better than I expected. We are already planning our next visit. Hopefully we will get a dry day next time.
Norma f ,Visited the zoo while on holiday in Blackpool plenty to see the animals are so cared for you can see there well looked after a lovely day out with husband more of the family visited as well but they went there own way around the zoo the whole family enjoyed the day out well worth a visit elephants were a joy
Pay for parking too!!!!,The zoo is a little over priced for what you get! Paid £2.50 for parking p** take Paid £92 for 2 adults 4 children with food booked online Paid £2.85 each for a poncho p** takeThen there was drinks etc ...There didn’t seem enough to see and do! maybe the zoo needs some sort of train or boat for the kids and a better play area Plus for big cats and apes there wasn’t much space for them needs trees and much more space As for the burger and hot dogs🤢🤮 tasted very cheap Lovely Starbucks though 🤡
in safe hands.,"thanks to the staff who took control and arranged an ambulance for my husband today,after he fell and cut his head,also the couple who helped out.we felt surrounded by kindness,and in very safe hands.he is shaken but on the mend.before this accident we enjoyed a lovely look at the fabulous zoo,and will return to finish our day out,thank you all."
Good few hours out but not a full day experience (no reptile house),"I live within a stone throw of the zoo, I'm always using the path round the perimeter fence to get from A to B. After a few years since our last visit a friend and I decided to make a last minute trip. I understand booking online and in advance is cheaper but we didn't have much change from £40 for two adults by just turning up at the gate. I know that locals can get into the Pleasure beach relatively cheap, it's a shame the zoo does not offer a locals discount all year round (especially when I can sometimes hear the animals at night!) Don't take that as a complaint though it's awesome having so many interesting creatures so close to home. As it's the last few days of the school holidays It was relatively busy but we got time to see everything, Including the new Elephant paddock. I have walked past it from the outside so many time, and you can sometimes get REALLY close to them from outside the zoo, absolutely gorgeous animals and I really hope the places manages to get a male to start breeding.However this Wouldn't be a true review without a negative, I was really disheartened to see that the reptile house was no longer there. When I got took to that place as a kid I always looked forward to  all the creepy crawly animals most. Apart from a few lizards scattered around  there was just no mention of the place. All in all we had a really good few house at the zoo, maybe a little overpriced, but as were paying for animal upkeep, BUT BRING BACK THE REPTILE HOUSE!"
Great day out...,What a great day out.... Having decided late on to call in before we went home we weren't disappointed at all. Not the biggest zoo we've been too but that helps with our youngest child. The animals all seemed happy and well looked after. The dinosaur attraction is a great addition and something different. We would happily come back if in the area again.
Excellent Family Day Out!!!,"Excellent Day as always and the sun was beaming which is bonus!!!!As a family we have Bronze Membership Cards which are fantastic, if you go twice in a 1 year period then you have saved money so it is worth looking into. Just so you know the bronze membership only allows entry on a Sunday but as we work during the week that is perfect for us!They have upgraded a few things since our last visit......• They have new dinosaurs that move, make sounds and even spray you with water!!!!• Rainbow Landings - A beautiful walk through aviary with Rainbow Lorikeets in which you can try to feed with a cup of nectar for £1 which is a lovely idea!!**Please if you may be skittish of birds flying and landing on you please don't go in. We saw children and adults jump, run a mile and throw their plastic cups onto the ground and not bother picking them up.Also please keep an eye on your children, because the birds were not coming to this particular child he threw the cup in the direction of the birds, stuck his tounge out and ran off. We have polluted the planet with our selfish ways please don't pollute their enclosure!!! Rant Over **FOOD...The only reason there isn't a 5th star is the main restaurant was a complete disaster, gueues coming out of every door, no adult sandwich bags, drink all over the floor along with ice dripping from the machines.And near £7 for a pre-made sandiwch, drink and crisps 😡 Maybe grab a meal deal from Tesco beforehand.I would say it would be less hectic if you brought your own food but if you do want to eat there maybe I would try the other food places there.....maybe the one near the big playground which offers the likes of burgers and hotdogs just like the main restaurant but is not as busy but thrre is no indoor seating there except at the main restaurant.All in all it was a lovely day out and would come again.I"
Fantastic,Only booked it for the dinosaur safari as my kids are dinosaur mad! However they loved every bit of it. Plenty to see and do and takes a good few hours to see everything. Downside was the food in the cafe. We got a family entry and meal combo. Limited to what you got but that was ok. Long queues but that was expected. The meal I ate (jacket potato) was lovely but the rest had burger or hot dog with chips and none of them liked any of it.
Family trip,Went to blackpool zoo and it was really good....been to Chester zoo alot of times and this place is so much better...The layout is really good....the kids loved it here....they loved getting close to the animals.There is a massive park area for the the kids to play on its next to the cafe area so ideal for them to play while us parents have a break....Excellent value for moneySpent all day there...outstanding
Great afternoon ,"Had a great time at the zoo, parking was easy and only £2.50 to park. We didn't book online so we had to wait and pay at entrance, I would say with the amount of people with picnics would be a sign of how much food and drink cost in the zoo but it was quite reasonable. A good sea lion show and the lemurs are very friendly."
Excellent day out,We went here on Tuesday with our two granddaughters. We have never been before but all had a good time. Plenty of animals to see and things to do. The girls especially liked the sea lion  display. Easy to find and reasonably priced would recommend this as a good day out.
Brilliant,"Great day out, loads to see and do. Visited with my wife and 4 year old grandson. We all had a really enjoyable day something for all ages. The grounds are really well looked after and the overall cleanliness is exceptional. Definitely will be back."
Zoological,Had a wonderful day out at blackpool zoo which is served by the number 20 bus from the bus stand by blackpool tower. When we got there it wasn't that busy the zoo itself may not be as big as Chester zoo but what I will say is the animals look happy and the outlay of the zoo is well planned and accessible to all. The highlights for me were the elephant enclosure and getting to meet and stroke a sea lion which costs £10 Per person but Is well worth the experience
Good set out zoo,"Had a great time at this zooWell set out and great viewing of all animals. The giraffe and elephant enclosures are well set up for viewing inside and out. The gorilla mountain is impressive with lots of areas for them to roam. One criticism would be big cats, would like more viewing angles to see them. I would visit again."
A great visit. ,We did enjoy the zoo very much. However the reason I am doing a review is to say how helpful all the staff were. I had a problem ( of my own making ) and the staff were great especially Steph at reception. She could not have been kinder or more understanding of what had happened . A special thank you to her. Whilst very efficient she managed to give the impression she had all the time in the world for you. A great ambassador for the zoo.
Brilliant Experience,"Blackpool Zoo is brilliant, really interactive with so much to see and do. Get there early if you want to feed the giraffes as it books up quickly. You can feed the birds in a new attraction room which is amazing. There’s so much to do and see, we’ve been a few times and it really is worth a visit. A good idea to add food onto your booking, the deal is a great saving and the food is not bad!"
