Closed,It was closed when we visited it. Its better if you take the Ram Jhula since that puts you in close proximity with the Parmarth Niketan and all the souvenir shops
Travel,Nice place to visit during the winters specially enjoying the breeze from Ganges and ofcourse the beautiful view..
Amazing place,There are two such suspension bridges: the Lakshman Jhula Bridge and the Ram Jhula Bridge. Both allow people to have a lovely view over the sacred river Ganga.Quite similar to the Ram Jhula.It is supposed to be only for pedestrians but we have come across many scooters crossing it in a happy chaos.
Iconic landmark,This is an iconic landmark of Rishikesh. Very beautiful views of Ganga from here. Lots of sight seeing options nearby
Without it you would be swimming,"Built in 1923 this 137 meter footbridge is an essential conduit for pedestrian traffic across the Ganga. Closed for two months in 2019, it was repaired and reopened, this time to pedestrian only traffic. I understand the government plans to do a full replacement in the next few years. The 2 month closure was just awful. It offers a beautiful view and unforgettable experience. Don’t touch the monkeys and keep food out of sight, they can get aggressive."
Laxman Jhula,Only bridge that cross the magnificent Ganga river unless you walk down 40 mins down to Ram Jhula. Plenty of cafes and shops. Make sure you are not holding or eating foods. The monkeys will take them from you. Very aggressive monkeys.
well. its a bridge,"Lakshman, or Laxman, is a minor hindu deity; this suspension bridge is where he supposedly crossed the Ganga.  It is a nice bridge; unlike its downstream brother, Ram Jhula, scooters are not allowed, so you can cross in relative quiet, but watch out for the monkeys.  The Indian tourists regard it as an ideal place for selfies; the foreign tourists just try to avoid being jostled."
Serene,I went here with my friends and the aura is serene here. The feeling you get while walking on the suspension bridge is amazing and the view of the river is mind blowing. You can't miss this place if you are in rishikesh.
Beautiful yet crowded,"Beautiful views, both day and night, lots of crazy monkeys, be aware cause they are attacking people."
Visit in the evening ,There are many cafes near Lakshman jhula. One can sit there in evening and enjoy the view of river and Lakshman Jhula.
Nice bridge,"Good place to get a view of the Ganga, and of the buildings lining its banks. Seems like it’s always crammed with visitors taking selfies, so it can be a bit slow-going. Unlike the Ram Jhula, motorcycles and scooters are not permitted on the bridge at this time (February 2020) but (perhaps as a consequence) there are more cows on this one."
A good year,"Laksman jhula bridge is an experience and I saw many wonderful views while walking it. Monkeys playing, motorbikes coming here and there, sadhus sitting at the ends. I loved every minute and the bridge connects you with all the stalls you could wish for"
Fantastic Jhula !!!,Explored Lakshman Jhula via the scenic route. Our hotel had organised a nature walk early in the morning. The chill in the wind and the rising sun mad a very heady atmosphere for our nature walk. Loved every moment of it and certainly enjoyed the Lakshman Jhula walk. Very few people on the Jhula which was a very pleasant sight. Thoroughly enjoyed the walk. Everyone should go for this experience.
Amazing,Apart from ram jhula the lakshman jhula is another suspension bridge which is a key attraction in rishikesh.you just cannot miss it if you are in rishikesh. A must visit place with amazing view and religious feel to it.
Watch out for monkeys,Beautiful suspension bridge with a beautiful view. Much quieter than Ram Jhula because motorcycles can’t get onto it but there are lots of monkeys. One of them bit me with no provocation and I had to get 5 rabies shots while in India
Power of Ganga,Just loved watching the powerful waters of Ganga every day while crossing the bridge! No bikes allowed unlike Ram Jhula. Beautiful view around and sounds of the temple.
Awsome,"I crossed Laxman jhula at 9 pm , it was the most satisfying feeling one can have .Sound of the mighty Ganges flowing below you and the serenity in the atmosphere and the cool breeze just touches your soul .. awsome feeling and the night time is the best time with minimum people and peace all around ."
Cool,The old construction is still intact. Feels thrilling when on this jhulla. If you hear heights then you must visit this place as it will make you feel safe even in this much height. Try it.
Visit with my wife👰 ,Rishikesh one of the best Holi place and Ganga Maa visit Lakshman Jhula Ram Jhula Parmarth Niketan and Beatles Ashram
With friends,Beautiful rishikesh i was with my family in rishikesh laxman jhula waterfall parmarth nikatan Beatles ashram
Lakahman jhula bridge,"Lakshman jhula bridge is a fantastic palace .you can see Ganga flowing when you go out on the bridge, the scenery is adorable. The weather is   giving the chill of nature . Fantastic place to be visited in rishikesh."
the holy paradise,Some experiences are difficult to express in words.And this probably was one of those.An unplanned detour made us land into Rishikesh and when in Rishikesh most important thing to do is visit the Lakshman Jhula.It’s has its own historic importance connecting two mountains of which one side of the mountain has the beautiful shiva and Devi temple which one should not miss.Other than don’t miss our drinking sugar cane juice right next to the temple entry.Coming to the iconic bridge it’s long n it swings a Little hence the name Jhula.It’s devotional but even a place to click memorable pictures.From the bridge enjoy the beautiful 360 degree view.Before the Jhula there is a German bakery restaurant try the beautiful sandwiches out there. Don’t miss it
It Sways,"This attraction is one of the most important and beautiful ones. When looking out of the bridge, you can see the Ganga flowing. A good hang about the bridge is that there are no motorbikes crossing so you can enjoy the view without any distractions. We even saw a cow crossing! But, you need to be aware of monkeys as one had almost attacked us!"
must visit,"march 2019, first time at Laxshman Jhula, i was here 1st time because of my friend Steve miller who treated me this trip, i tell you will love it, i did. lots of people, monkeys, cow, bikes and cycles, its still safe, just be careful of the monkey who will take your sunglasses, bags and will only return if you give money something to eat."
historically IMP but locals abuse its santitiy.,"the most iconic place in rishikesh the famed laxman jula has a lot of feeling for all travellers & tourists comming to rishikesh , the locals use this bridge for commuting & is open to bikes, cycles, scooters & the the locals give you an impression that the bridge is solely  made for their exclusive use and the tourists who walk up this suspension bridge are intruders, the locals a re very rude , harsh , inconsiderate & thankfully the bridge has weakened to a level that the govt. had closed down the iconic bridge to make a new one, hope they make a separate lane for the rude local bikers."
Lovely View ,Though the bridge is congested due to traffic the view from the bridge are amazing and worth a visit.
Lovely,"Love the bridge. Beware of the monkeys, don't carry food they will steal it from you :) beautiful to walk over the Ganges. Very good experience."
Serene,This is a picturesque bridge built over  a raging river. A nice place to take snaps as well.  Worth a visit while in rishikesh
A cool place,This little area is pretty good. It offers a vibrant atmosphere and a good vibe. A must peek while a short visit is good. Cannot ride bikes on this jhula.
Bridge with great all round views,"The Lakshman Jhula is a suspension bridge spanning about 90 metres across the River Ganges. It’s supposed to be a pedestrian only bridge, but that doesn’t seem to stop motorcyclists from using it. The bridge is a major landmark of Rishikesh, and thus popular with tourists and monkeys. The latter like to use it as a vantage point to watch out for naive tourists. The views are great on the bridge, you can see the fast flowing River Ganges, the water sports passing the bridge, the multi-storied Tera Manzil Temple and probably the best thing is the sunsets.Cows also like to use the bridge, you have to watch out for what they leave behind."
Visit India,"Walking in the market at Rishikesh and crossing this historical bridge is a must for any traveler. It is a colorful, vibrant, buzzing and friendly atmosphere. Clothing is cheap but you must learn or know how to bargain... SASSTA is the word to remember. Alot of unique products and services available."
Good views,Views of the Ganga are good. Bridge is a bit dirty and crowded. Only open to pedestrians. Easier to reach than Ram Jhula.
awesome view,locatedon the bank of ganges oneof the beautifulsite to be at reallyenjoyed the view will come again
Lovely quiet bridge,Unlike Ram juhla this one is closed for the cars and motorcycles. It is lovely to walk. In the night it lights up (at least half of it). Next to there are multiple cafes and stall to buy souvenirs.
Great,A very beautiful spot on rishikesh.  Although the place is getting crowded but still the scenic view of ganges is very beautiful.
Eiffel Tower of Rishikesh,It is an Iconic Symbol of Rishikesh. If someone comes to Rishikesh wanted to see this. This bridge was made in 1935 by Britishers and at that time it was a Marvel of Engineering - A bridge without pillars and suspending one. Even Willy Jeeps used to go on it. People used to come to see it from all over. After a period of approx. 85 years it is closed for bikes and now new bridge is in process next to it. It may still remain as a Memory.
Lakshman Jhula,"A lovely vibrant little area with cafes, restaurants and shops. Good food, cheap hotels and a bit of spirituality if inclined all found within walking"
Pleasant,Laxman jhool is one of the popular spot in Rishikesh constructed to honor the brave act of Laxman ji crossing River Ganges on two ropes. It's a beautiful cute from the centre of the bridge and the cafes located at the start of the bridge gives a great view. You should visit it provided you have time nothing so great to go specially for.
Excellent view of Ganga but to crowded sometimes ,Excellent location and place to cross and travel to other side of Rishikesh its very unique bridge but gets crowded sometimes. Can be maintained well with lights across at night as few lights wore not working also CCTV camera across bridge can be put for theft and crowds which stands in between for pictures and they don't move there has to be guards all the time at both sides of bridge .
Filthy and Dirty place,"Such a wonderful tourist destination marred with Cows and Buffaloes all over with dung on the road and one walks through that is the site of this location. Hundreds of foreign nationals were witnessing the scene giving a very poor picture of Tourism in India Could be well maintained by authorities if proper vigilance and checks are there. No proper parking with narrow roads, monkeys all around and grabbing eatables from tourist's hands scaring the individuals. Quite pathetic."
Too many crowds but still worthy to visit,"Laxman Jhula is also a very famous hanging bridge like Ramjhula. The view of the mountains are just wonderful. Generally, these places are famous for meditation but I must say you need a very strong control on your mind to meditate here. One of the good thing is that there is no motor bikes crossing the bridge but monkeys and cows are there. so be careful. One thing that I will strongly recommend is, to go to the 14th floor temple. The view of the bridge from that temple is just awsome. Please do visit the place."
Ganga Darshan,"Lovely vibe, nice place to walk around & shop for memoirs/ gifts. Lots of lovely temples, one can get a guide to take you around. There a lovely Hotel called Divine Resort --: excellent location, they have their own bakery tried their bluberry cheese cake which was quite nice."
Rishikesh - Tapovan peaceful and beautiful place.,"Especially the Tapovan area is beautiful and peaceful, both Lakshman Jhula and Ram Jhula are spectacular and give a great view and feel of the almighty Ganga flowing so peacefully. You should try the short boating trip on the Ganga river from next to Ram Jhula. Try the confectionery cafe next to at the start of Lakshman Jhula and a spectacular view of Ganga Banks from its balcony. Enjoy the local markets in the Tapovan area. Rishikesh is much more cleaner than Haridwar, but highly disappointed at the Rishikesh Triveni Ghat which - not well maintained. Go the brief is - Tapovan Rishikesh is the only place worth visiting and spending good time here while the Haridwar Arti is the best at appx. 5.30 pm onwards daily."
Did not go over it as they told us it was closed. It was not. So check.,We did not go over it as everyone told us it is closed for maintenance. Later on when we were having late lunch at a place we saw people walking over it. Beautiful it looks. Nice shops in the area surrounding it. Lot of nice eating places. The place has significance because it immortalises the last place where Lord Laxmana saw Sita Maiya leving for her vanvas.
The hanging bridge ,One of the other famous bridge over the Ganga river with historical importance. No 2 wheelers allowed on this one. Less crowded than Ram Jhula
Peaceful,"Enjoyed walking across this bridge over the Ganga River. So calm, peaceful and fresh air. not very crowded during the time we went. Took 20-30 mins to walk across and walk back"
One of the two famous ones here,We walked across the Laksham Jhula and enjoyed the views and the fresh air. This bridge is only for walkers and hence much nicer than Ram Jhula which gets very crowded.
Must see place in rishikesh,"After shopping when we walk in the evening from shiv Gauri pashmina world, A lightning bridge is there and it's beauty will attract u automatically.Must go"
Steady,This bridge floats over the Ganga and gives very clear view of beautiful surroundings. This Jhula is very old and strong enough to hold weight of people. Nice experience!!
Very good but tooo crowded,It's very good place to visit..... But it's over crowded but it's worth a while to walk in it.. Had fun
Spiritual Experience,In the city of ganges. Witnessed the sunset from Laxman Jhula. What a experinceThe arti by the ganges is one the high pount o this visit.
Most happening place in Rishikesh !!!,There is a stony pebbles beach had a bath here in morning. Felt the most peaceful ever in cold Ganges water.
Nice view,Nice view and no motorcycle to annoy you. You can see sun set from the bridge. Down to the river is very beautiful and romantic place.
interesting point of view with the feeling lakshman walked the same path,felt surreal presuming that we are walking the path that ram and laksman walked well it makes ramayan much more real
It was amazing bridge with no pillars just wires,Its an amazing construction of bridge on Ganga river. There will be lot of crowd moving from one side of the river to the other. Nice place to see the river Gangs especially while walking on the bridge.really loved this place.
good view from the bridge,"smaller bridge then ram jhulla. good walk over mother ganga. good view from the bridge. its very crowded though with lots of people walking. monkeys waiting to snatch food. people on 2 wheeler crossing bridge, recently 2 wheeler are not allowed as bridge is under renovation."
Beautiful view,"You'll have beautiful view walking over this suspended bridge, but be aware of monkeys, they may still food if you have some in your hand."
"It's a bridge, it's a selfie studio, it's a monkey zoo, it's a ceremony viewpoint, it's the Ganges","The pedestrian bridges in Rishikesh are a sight to behold. I love going early in the morning, just after sunrise, when it's most quiet, and spend some minutes over the most majestic of rivers, mother Ganga herself. Later during the day it might get overcrowded and not as pleasant, but still, a cool breeze will run along and it will be worth visiting. The views are fantastic and at the time of this review motorbikes where banned from running across, unlike Ram Jhula. Some people fear the yellow monkeys that gather to be fed or, sometimes, snap your bags from out of your hands. In my experience it's enough to hold your belongings tight, the least exposed, and if you cross with children, carry their things for them, for monkeys target them as they know it's a weaker resistance. They don't harm, but threaten to harm quite aggressively showing their teeth. The larger black faced monkeys on the other hand couldn't be more peaceful and friendly."
Crossing the bridge at sunset,"To go to Risikesh is an experience by itself. Although we are a little far.. we are still at Veda 5 ( ioga and ayurveda retreat) we have visited Risikesh several times. To beguin with to cross the bridge is marvelous as you face people, cows, cycles bikes ,dogs ,and people walking. It is difficult to understand but it works. It is magic!! No one interferes and there is a respect among all creatures. The other point is that you have the river Ganges below and obviously you see it from both sides of the river. It is very special to see so many rafting boats from the bridge but rafting is something I can not comment on as we have not experiecd it. We have experience reading at sunset on one of "" the beaches"" at the river. In the Ganges we are told not to swim as it is a holy place for indians. Apart from that point that obviously has to be respected, there is also the strength of the water that can you take you in instants. However to put your feet in the river is allowed and it has it symbolic significance"
Walk down the bridge ,"Do make sure to walk down the bridge with its mix of locals, tourists and cows, evening is a good time."
Evening aarti ,"One of the 2 tourist sightseeing bridges in Rishikesh, this is the older one, great place to see Ganga Aarti."
Bridge across the Ganges,A must see in Rishikesh are the pedestrian bridges across the Ganges. The only thing is that scooters also use in droves.Worth a look and gaze down at the relatively unpolluted upper Ganges.
Laxman Juhla falling apart,"Laxman Juhla is a famous bridge in the Tapovan area of Rishikesh. Named after Lord Ram’s brother Laxman, symbolizing his crossing of Ganga at this very place. The bridge build in 1923 is now in such bad condition that its concidered dangerous to pass and thus closed by the goverment in june 2019. Upon my latest visit in october it was still open to public passing, with no warning signs. Its made more complicated to enter the bridge and motorbikes cant cross (which is nice), but to foreign turists, there is no indications of why. So be aware and do get a historic glimpse of the bridge before its replaced in a few years. The nearest other bridge is half an hour walk from Laxman Juhla. “Ram Juhla” is situated near muni ke reti. That too is a busy bridge, now even more crowded, especially by motorbikes crossing in the evening, making it quite a task to cross."
Peaceful in morning,"I visited the Laxman jhoola thrice, over 2 daysVery crowded and dirty in the afternoon, with scores of monkeys and people...To really enjoy the gangaji , and the slight swaying of the bridge, be sure to visit at the break of dawn.. Serene, peaceful and must visit"
Wonderful place!,"Visited in night time around 9PM, and the chilling breeze at the middle of breeze felt so awesome. Sitting on the bridge outskirt wall having tea, looking towards the Ganga river and the bridge, can be a great fulfilling experience in evening or night time. Nice place to be."
Great views,"Nice views, fun to climb the temple and ring the bell next to the bridge with kids...Bridge more pleasant than Ram Juula, as not motobikes"
Always a busy place,We love sauntering around this area. It was even more delightful as the end of the celebration of Navratri came to an end. A temporary temple was erected on  the Tapovan side. So much colour!
Spirituality ,We always associate Rishikesh to spirituality and Yoga hub . Such a lifetime experience it is visiting this place
Lakshman Jhula,Pretty amazing night view.It was quite busy during the day.Beautiful clothing markets and sightseeing to do in Rishikesh.
Cafe rooh,You will love their food....beautiful lakshman jhula beautiful cafe...I love their food and interior..
Fantastic meeting place for travellers walked from Rham Jhula every day ,Very hot drink plenty of water there are lots of things to do rafting bathing in the holy river with the people very safe often I was the only white man in amongst the people who come from all over India to bathe in the river The Mother of India you need a dip twice a day because of the heat its fantastic
 Accommodating ALL forms of Movement ,"This Bridge which is one of two spanning the River Ganges in Rishikesh is located on the ‘upstream’ side.  Constructed in 1929 at the location where it is said that the deity Lakshman used ropes to cross, it was intended for vehicles and pedestrians. The vehicles could only be of the 2 wheel type as it is a mere 2M/6ft in width. There is no fee to cross the Bridge as I understand it , the replacement was paid for substantially by a wealthy person in honour of his father and that was the conditional payment. Today I also learnt that the gate at either end now prevents the ubiquitous cows we see everywhere, but in the fields, and the Scooters from crossing this Bridge. It is now a fully Pedestrian Bridge.  Interesting but I also noticed an absence of monkeys.  The Bridge certainly provides a great opportunity to take pictures, both upstream and downstream. Unlike other visits I have made here, the Holy River is brown and Very Fast Moving, due to the unseasonably wet weather"
Roo cafe,Amazing place people always keep in touch of what you want clean place and they are so kind. Highly recommend
The Man made Swing for Gods,An Engineering masterpiece in India. Beautiful 360 degree view of 'The ganges'. While standing you can feel the fresh air.
An important attraction in Rishikesh,Take a walk on this bridge to experience the view on both sides and the Ganga river below. The other parallel bridge is Ram Jhula which is about 2Km away.
A Divinity criss-crossing the majestic Ganges,"When one talks of Laxman Jhula we are transported to the Ramayana era and a holiness envelops & besieges us.The metallic suspension bridge is the landmark of the famed Yoga capital of the world - Rishikesh town.Rishikesh is 25 kms from Haridwar and a gateway to the Dhams Gangotri,Yamunotri etc,The bridge was closed from 12th July but thankfully when we visited in September it has allowed access to pedestrians.I feel it should be kept that way ie no two wheelers should be allowed as then the bridge becomes venerable to damage and with the congestion & honking by vehicles,the charm is lost.The bridge is quite narrow hence nuisance to tourists is also avoided this way.Originally the bridge was a jute bridge which as per mythology was used by Laxman to cross the Ganges and so the name.About 130 years back , the jute bridge was replaced by a metallic one.I had the pleasure of viewing a full Ganges from the bridge with my wife & sons.The views both side are a treat for the eyes.The majestic Ganges in full flow leaves the Shivalik Hills of the Himalayas and enters the plains of Northern India.On one side of the Bridge is the Bazaar area and on other side the beautiful 13 storeyed Shiva Temple."
Nice bridge and nice area for shopping,Beautiful bridge over the river Ganges and nice area for shopping. Nice organic supermarkets and lots of souvenir shops.
Best caption to take snaps... ,Heading towards for first step of my life being married ... we went with my all family members together for this trip and we enjoyed so much... most popular bridge where you feel that bridge will flow down into the river... many new tourist people feel like that.. but actually that is the most important part of this bridge..
terrible,"locals who criss cross feel you are a intruder in their territory , they honk as if they own & built the jula and any outsider on the bridge is their enemy they are so ruthless, abusive, good the bridge is closed"
"You have to cross it, while it still lasts","It is an experience to try to cross the bridge pretty much at any time but especially around noon or 1pm on Sunday. At the end of my stay, cattle and motorcycles were no longer permitted to cross on this bridge that is for pedestrians. The police mounted barricades and set up posts with 4 policemen on each side of the bridge. The views from the bridge are unique."
Lakshman Jhula and Rishikesh go hand by hand joined by the bridge,"As much to see and shop on one side of the bridge as the other. Cafes, shops, temples, hotels and a barber who will massage your head vigorously at the end of the haircut. Just do it."
Fun,"Lovely experience, did the river rafting there very friendly people although the language can be a barrier with the locals. Some speak English well but overall was a magical experience!"
Historical bridge with a great view,"The Laxman Jhula is a bridge. The bridge is 100 years old and is a suspension bridge across the ganges with mythological connections. It has a beautiful view of the ganges flowing in the mountains.  An adventurous walk and a great view of flowing water. The wind, the height and the sound of the water make it an exciting experience."
Well known place.,Visited with family and friends.Hanging metal bridge connecting 2 village over the Ganges.Though supposed to be close for maintenance but we found it open for walking....Strange but good for us.We loved walking on it as there is lots of shopping on both side of jhula and other historical buildings.
Laxman jhula crossing was fun,"Crossing Laxman Jhula was an experience in itself .At daytime it would be busier with the traffic of two wheelers taking around 2-3mins to cross the jhula & at night time with little or no traffic, it would take less than a minute. But every time it was both fun and scary especially at night with the cool wind blowing and sound of the gushing Ganges beneath the jhula making the experience a lot more spooky !!"
Landmark at Rishikesh,3 km from ram juhla and you can get a share auto. Beware you have to walk a long with more ups and downs which need stemina. Better engage a car or auto with up and down. One shiv temple with 20 feet Linga is good place in this place which is also called as tapovan. Since the age of the bridge is high and weak Government has withdrawn people walking in the bridge. However people are walking in the bridge. Beware of monkeys. Again you can have a nice view of Ganga on both side.
Walk in Lakshman Jhula,Nice bride connecting both banks of Ganges river. The only hurdle is that this bridge is narrow and is common for both pedestrians and two wheeler. There are lots of Hindu temples around and one can spend hours going around.
crossed bridge several times,I am a frequent visitor to laxman julah in Rishikesh and Iam delighted to hear that whilst the bridge will remain open to pedestrians motor bikes and scooters will be banned. I hope this will be permanent as the ne thing that  ruins an otherwise beautiful experience is the large number of 2 wheelers that cross the bridge. They cause a lot of pollution from diesel fumes but also show no consideration for pedestrians expecting them to get out of their way all the time . the sheer number of these vehicles makes crossing the bridge an unpleasant experience
Let the bridge breathe..,"Madding crowd weakened the Bridge as well as ruined the entire location with litter and filth. I doubt the common sense, civic sense, travel sense of the people who rushed towards this Jhula for selfies. Admire it, adore it but let the bridge serve the purpose of connecting two worlds of the locals. Bridge is not a statue but it is a pathway to move on. It took 2 hours from Dehradun Airport to reach Tapovan. The whole stretch was jammed  and polluted. I really forced myself to get down from the cab due to the traffic jam(More than the Bangalore traffic). Crossing the bridge was a herculean task. It's also a great responsibility of the government to clear the crowd impeding the pathway. The agencies for rafting mushroomed everywhere(not sure whether all of them registered under Uttarakhand tourism). Their vehicles with boat causing the major factor for the traffic jam. I think that we should avoid few places for the sake of saving the environment and let the locals to run their everyday life."
It was closing,"It was rather disappointing to see that Laxman Jhula was being closed to public. We were there early in the morning and were lucky to have had the chance to feel the cool breeze that blows over the Ganga river, a feeling that people will not be able to get while the bridge is repaired. Then again, it better closed than an accident happening..."
Most Beautiful View of Ganges,This place is awesome and the river rafting experience was great.nearby there is one bungee jumping sight which can cost u around 2-3k per person.  The whole ambience and surrounding is so soothing.  It mesmerized me and took me to another world.
Ravi ,Laxman Jhula is world tourist attraction place in Rishikesh. At present this bridge is closed due to maintenance purposes by Uttarakhand state government and I request to state government to open it soon when it meet all safety requirements for all weather 🙏💐
Amazing view of River Ganga,"Lakshman Jhula is a huge bridge across the River Ganges, located 5 kms the city of Rishikesh. The bridge connects two villages of Tapovan in Tehri Garhwal district to jonk in Pauri Garhwal district. Lakshman Jhula is also used by motorcycles. A larger bridge from Lakshman Jhula is Ram Jhula. It is very crowded. It's nice for go one place to another place."
Crowded.,"Though this unique bridge is much scenic and people use to cross river thru, this is over crowded. Its a main bridge gives you feel about the beauty of the place."
A Must to visit spot in Rishikesh.,"This is one of the most popular and must to visit place in Rishikesh, One can see the iconic vies of The Ganges."
One Of The Two Jhulas,This is one of the two jhulas which is over the river Ganga. The panoramic view from this is soothing.
Laxman Jhula,One of the two jhulas of Rishikesh. Another one is Ram Jhula. The memzmerizing view of Ganga while crossing the river on top of it is awesome.
Fun,"It was very crowded , but it is a experience, ganga water flowing beneath it , the bridge sways like a mild push to a jhula , can be done morning or evening."
Awesome,view is good just over crowded as motorcycles andvscootys also cross through this...A bit scary as it shakes when over crowded
Spotted a Crocodile ,Spotted a Crocodile below the Lakshman Jhula. Very shocked on how safe it is to take dip in Holy Ganga.
Divinity all around ,You feel the presence of divinity around you when you visit such historically religious places. This looks even more beautiful when lights are on. The government should do all they can to preserve such places and keep it clean.
"Very crowded, yet must see","India's oldest suspension bridge.Very crowded, but must see. also visit thirteen floor temple just nearby"
Narrow bridge,This is one of the pedestrian bridges to cross the river Ganga at Rishikesh. While on the bridge view of Ganges is mesmerising.
Good place,It is a rope bridge on river Ganga and pilgrims can be seen always. There are several temples near by. a great view of Ganga coming down from Himalayas.
Pilgrim place ,Beautiful sightseeing the view at night was amazing. Was surprised to see monkeys and people walking together
Best place to visit in Rishikesh!,The Laxman Jhula named after Lord Ram's brother Laxman is a must visit attractions in Rishikesh. Must not be missed! View of mountains and river Ganga is very scenic!
See it from heritage site point of view,It's a nice heritage site of this country and we should look at it from that context only and not mixing it from any religious beliefs. The bridge is always very crowded and even motorists using it makes it really chaotic.The view of river from middle of the bridge is really amazing.
Must visit and shopping.,You will enjoy the views in early morning. At all other times is very crowded. keep small kids in your control during wee hours.
A squeeze,"This is one of the two footbridges that cross the Ganges in Rishikesh, both suffer from the same plague though of frequent horn-blowing motorcyclists and scooter riders, who feel that the pedestrians should not have right of way."
Best side of the River,"This bank of the river has a more sedate and therefore enjoyable pace to it than the opposite more commercialized bank, there is an esplanade along much of the way between the two footbridges over the Ganges here, and this is where to go people watching and to interact with the Sadhus."
Stunning,Beautiful place....been there previously and will certainly go back again. A must see for any traveller.
Lakshman jhula is one of oldest man made hanging bridge ,"Rishikesh is famous for two bridges on ganga lakshman jhula and new bigger one ram jhula. If you do not visit these ,u will miss something during your holy visit. Lot of cottages and restaurant hotels are situated around lakshman jhula. Foreigners learn yoga and meditation and take a daily dip in holy Ganges."
Great experience,It is a fun taking stroll over the bridge. The view is stunning. It is always crowded all the times. Go across to the other side and visit all temples and indulge in some shopping. Finding a parking place is a nightmare. It is better not to drive your self. There are lots of hotels and restaurants in the vicinity.
Good,"Lovely bridge,nice view from the place,safe even at night.will recommend everyone visiting Rishikesh it's a must going through lakshman julha and returning by ram julha."
Enchanting but crowded,"Lakshman Jhula is beautiful! Have been there several times. There is a lot happening there: satsangs, ayurveda, charity work, rafting, trekking, yoga, courses, wonderful places to eat, temples, shopping, bookshops, places to stay  .....  and of course the Ganga is there and the river banks are very nice, also sandy. There is a lot of variety. Lots of tourists as well as Nepalese are there. But, be prepared for the crowd, scooter, noise etc.. there are also plenty of monkeys ... and at times cows on the bridge. It is also easy to walk from Lakshman Jhula to Ramjhula or take a taxi or a bus to Rishikesh, Haridwar and so on."
Lakshman jhula,Local shops and plenty of stores around the jhula are selling religious items and items for positive energy like crystal and rudraksh etc. Prices range from hundred to several thousand rupees. The ghats are clean and beautiful. Ganga aarati in evening at Parmarth ghat is not to be missed for It's spiritual feel.
Amzing view of River Ganga at any time of the day,One must experience this suspension bridge when in rishikesh. Fast winds and eye soothing view in the evening will make you speechless if you are a nature lover.
Laxman Jhula - A Rishikesh Icon,"The Laxman Jhula is a about 300-400 ft long bridge on Ganges, with sweeping views of Ganges flowing through valley created by the Shivalika hill ranges. A very busy place, a bit ruined by selfie crowd."
HISTORIC PLACE,You have an excellent view of river ganga. The air is quite cool and you can shop from the market nearby.best place to visit its an amazing experience to be hare
Best views of Ganges in Rishikesh,Loved the views of Ganges and Rishikesh from top of Ganges. Zoola gets very busy in evening due to Aarti. So May choose early morning or afternoon time...
A beutiful bridge for walking passengers,"If you travel in rishikesh you will use this bridge contantly, Just know that you will share it with cows, monkeys and motorbikes"
Lakshman jhula,"Rishikesh is the best place to visit if you need some relaxation. You must visit lakshman khula if you went to rishikesh.. Such a Beautiful place, calm and positive 👌👌👌"
Very nice hanging bridge!,"Standing on this bridge, one can see the ferociously flowing Ganga below. Its a sight to behold!! 2 wheelers, pedestrians & cows make this bridge walk, a little tough to maneuver. Nice view of the Rishikesh river bank from this bridge."
a famous one,the bridge to cross the river with mythological values. Gets a bit crowdy during Aarti time in the evening.
"Laxman jhula , Rishikesh",Another engineering marvel. Awesome view of Alakananda. We went via Laxman jhula and returned after our lunch via Ram jhula These are the devine places where one can do meditation if he is serious.
Average Visit,Nothing much to say only used to connect two sides of Rishikesh. Over crowded and over hyped location.
Nice bridge but too narrow..,"Nice suspension bridge, boating available n ghar for taking a dip. crowded bridge with two wheelers also allowed to pass. You will get lot of shops there, we purchase few clothes which were reasonable , not to costly as supposed to be being a tourist destination. You can go to nearby restaurants , sit and relax at ganga ghat"
Great market ,"Laksman jhula is a hige market, where one can get a few deals. Very busy but some little coffee shops hidden away with paths to the Ganga.Great experience there. I"
Very amaziing,Very nice experience to go there we have been here many times always a gud experience to go there night view is really gud
Iconic Laxman Jhuuuula,"Laxman jhula a identical kind of Bridge of Ram Jhula, Very crowded, view from Jhula of Rishikesh is mesmerising Quite un-safe due to Two wheeler  for Old aged tourists."
Laxman Jhula,"It was not so scary as I thought it would be. It was Sunday so too much crowd, cows,bikes and selfie lovers. Either you can follow the crowd and walk with it or be little brave and cut the crowd to make your way. Really impressive structure and super strong. It looks beautiful with lights on."
Disappointed very much,We wanted to go to the other side of the river but found out the only way to reach there was the Lakshman Jhula. It was small and they let 2 Wheelers go through the bridge. It was small and crowded and didn't like crossing the bridge. truly disappointing experience.
Best place,Good you can enjoy on the bank of the GangaYou need to arrange your own transportation or need to walk to go to the place Distance between both the jhula is nearly 3Km
Beyond mythology ,Beyond the mythology and stories associated with this the bridge serves as a lifeline for local people and a must visit tourist spot for us. Always busy hence you will not be allowed to stand and enjoy the feel of the place or the views.
Good Location But Crowded,Lakshman Jhula is a good and worthy place to visit but Two wheeler allowed on bridge. However its full of Beggars and Bikers Honking and animal also on bridge.
Wonderfull view but too many scooties and bikes agressivly use the bridge,too touristical place - agressive monkeys ready to take your food and too any scooties and bikes use this pedestrian bridge
Iconic,"Lakshman Jhula (Swing) on River Ganga is not a swing, but a passage built to cross the river. Crafted in 1929, the bridge is built with the help of jute ropes, strong enough for pedestrians & motorbikes."
wow experience,laxman jhula is a must visit if you go to rishikesh. standing in the middle of bridge in evening when the wind blow at super fast speed is an experience itself
A much crowded yet much visit,"A much crowded yet much visited by all,... be it humans, 2 Wheelers or the famous Bulls of Rishikesh !"
A much crowded yet much visit,"A much crowded yet much visited bridge which is used by ALL,,, be it human, 2 wheelers or the BULLs !"
Amazing Laxman Jhula ,Very amazing  big Jhula seen . It’s around 5 ft in width and 150 ft in length . Not much more seen to here
A bridge which swings,"One of the two famous bridges (the other being Ram Jhula) across Ganges.Built in 1939, it is a 450feet long swinging bridge, where walking and two wheelers (and some cattle) are allowed.Named after Laxman, younger brother of Ram, it has temples dotting its either side.  It also has the famous 13-storey Trimbakeshwar temple near it, with each floor dedicated to a different diety"
Ram Jhula,Ram Jhula is one of the main iconic landmarks of Rishikesh located at the 3 Km from the main city. Ram Jhula build in the year 1986 and this is an iron suspension bridge.
Laxman Jhula,Laxman Jhula is a 450 feet long Iron Suspension Bridge situated at the 5 Km in the northeast of the holy city across the river Ganga. It is one of the prominent landmarks at Rishikesh.
Popular ,"It’s basically a bridge that’s for the most part very busy anytime of day or night; only people and motorcycles are able to cross, also an occasional cow/bull, but they don’t mean any harm!"
Extremely crowded,"Thankfully this bridge is made of iron & has been tarred like a road. Otherwise, it would have broken down long time ago for the kind of crowd. It is wide enough for 2 hefty people to walk together comfortably. There were policemen standing on both sides of the jhula, but 2-wheelers were ridden from one end to the other which is not permitted. Each time a 2-wheeler passed by, the jhula would shake causing fear, because we have never walked on a shaky bridge before. There were cows resting on the bridge obstructing movement of people. There were roughly 200 people on the bridge at a time.....pheewww.It is an experience of a lifetime but my next visit will surely be during a low season when not many tourists are around."
An iconic landmark of Rishikesh ,"Luxman jhula is a suspension bridge across the Holy Ganges river in Rishikesh, joining eastern bank of the river to the western bank.  It is a mythological symbol and a great tourists attraction of Rishikesh. It is believed that Hindu deity Luxman, younger brother of Lord Rama, crossed the river Ganga via a bridge made of jute ropes. The present Luxman jhula is said to be built on that sacred place.  Photography at Luxman jhula is an exciting experience presenting a fabulous view.  Never miss visiting  Luxman jhula and Ram jhula in Rishikesh!"
Cute swinging bridge across Ganga,"This is a bridge connecting the two banks of river Ganga in Rishikesh. It swings slightly when there is high wind and hence the name ""jhula"". I was surprised to see two wheelers being allowed on the narrow bridge which creates a lot of inconvenience to the pedestrians..the view of the temple across the banks and the valleys with the mighty Ganga flowing in between is picturesque..not to be missed when in rishikesh"
Nice temple around ,Laxmanejhula very famous in rishikesh nice aarti and nice temple Ganges is clean  spirituality ashram is around there
Back and fro foot bridge,"I wonder how many people, bikes and cows make it back and fro over this bridge per day?It’s painted in the national colors and is light up at night. You see beautiful views of the one section of the river on both sides of the bridge."
Heaven on Earth ,"Much visit place for All travellers. Great Restaurants serving cuisines of All countries. Ample of Adventure and Sports Activities like bunjee jumping, river rafting, trekking, hiking etc. Great Romantic spots. Great Family spots. Great spiritual experiences to be gained. An Overall Package. All we want in a Location and in a Holiday."
Hippie side of Rishikesh,Well like i say in my Title. It is indeed the Hippie land on this side. With lot shopping and like minded ppl and having amazing food joints. And people are free and in their own world.For shopaholics this Paradise. Please bargain you can do it unless you are too generous.You have many restaurants (veg) facing the Ganges and some Psy music to chill with. Be there to experience it.CheersShilpa
Lakshman Jhula Rishikesh India ,Lakshman Jhula Rishikesh illuminates in the night looks spectacular . Must visit in the evening between 6-7 pm to watch the Ganga Aarti
Walk only,Although two wheelers ply on this. It's better to walk and enjoy the view. At both ends there's ppl singing and dancing on religious songs and chants.
"great view, beware of the monkeys and don't stop to take a photo!",it's quieter in the mornings when crossing this bridge. in March it can get incredibly busy to the point it's almost unbearable. lovely view and very special crossing the River Ganga.
Trip,"Lakshman Jhula is a suspension bridge across the river Ganges, located 5 kilometres north-east of the city of Rishikesh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The bridge connects the two villages of Tapovan in Tehri Garhwal district, on the west bank of the river, to Jonk in Pauri Garhwal district, on the east bank"
HOME #2,"One of my favorite places EVER!!!!!!!!!Ganga, temples, mountains....pretty much everything you need is here."
Live free,5/ 5The stay at the hotel was very nice.The location of the hotel was easily accessible for me.The staff and services were good at the hotel.The food and dinning was not available there at the hotel I availed it from outside.
nice,laxman is also a nice place to visit in rishikeah. its not the original one. it was rebuilt again but still a great attraction.
My love of this place,Guys this place was my favourite place of the india in uttrakand.... I wish to live here for life i loveguys if you not visit their so must must visit this place...... My love of this place ni onecalculate
Walk over the Ganges,"A must do activity in Rishikesh. Walk across the bridge and experience the noise and bustle of people, cows and motor bikes on this reasonably long suspension gateway."
Active part of town with lots of small shops,"Amazing part of town with lots of small shops, ganga views restaurants and lors of street activities. It has to be visited during your stay in Rishikesh !"
The Indian experience all in one bridge !,"Beautiful view from the bridge! It's a very busy bridge so be prepared, it can take quite a long time to cross it. The motorbikes are using it, honking a lot - and most people stop for selfies. Add to that, the monkeys trying to steal bags, and the cows sitting across the path. If you want the full Indian experience, this bridge is the perfect place ;)"
Beautiful View Impressive Location,Must visit if in Rishikesh. Many cafes to sit and admire the bridge and the view. India in all its wonder and colour pass through here. Be careful when crossing of motorbikes and monkeys. Lovely places to visit on both sides of the bridge.
Endless Show,"I enjoy this area for the people watching, the views and vendors.  The walking is wonderful and the photo op just endless."
A stunning view on Rishikesh and Ganga,"This bridge offers a magic view over Ganga and Laxman Jhula part of Rishikesh and far beyond. A place of encounter of passers by, scooters, bikes, monkeys and cows. Amazing atmosphere that cannot be found elsewhere. A popular selfie place."
The views are incredible!,"Both sides of other sides of the bridge are so awesome! It's not scary to walk on this bridge, lots of people, motorbikes, and cows cross the bridge haha. The views are absolutely breathtaking!"
Must-see in Rishikesh,"You cannot miss this landmark while being in Rishikesh as it is essential to cross the Ganga. It is a pedestrian bridge, but you'll have to share it not only with other visitors, but monkeys, cows and motor bikes and scooters as well :-DIt is a memorable experience watching how this chaos works and everybody gets to cross the bridge in the end. An amazing view to the right and left is guaranteed. It is a great feeling watching the nice and clean Ganga below you.Don't carry food openly while crossing the bridge unless you want it to be taken by the monkeys. And watch out for cow droppings or cows chilling on the bridge ;-)"
Enjoyed the trip,While crossing Ganga River by Laxman Jhula one gets exitment . Good place for photography but now a days there is crowd in the area
Terrifying for pedestrians,"This bridge has every animal and vehicle on earth trying to cross it, but is so nattow that nobody can move.You have to cross this bridge to get to all the good stuff, but it's a bloody harrowing experience!"
Good place,"This place reach is through a narrow road which get jammed. I travelled here on bike upto the river side. The area near laxman jhula has many restaurants and shops.The view from the bridge is very good.I took bath in river ganges here, the water was crystal clear and cold enough to bath.The level of water was safe enough."
Relaxing place ,You can visit this place in evening for Aarti to relax near the beach side and have some good food .
Best view,"luxan Jhula, very crowed and fun, lots of cow, monkey, bikes. and many people, night time Good lighting,"
Dangerous place to walk,"This suspension bridge is quite old and connects two sides of River Ganga but there is no control over speeding bikes and scooters, who are a potential threat to the pedestrians.  It is a good sight from a distance.  We came across number of foreigners, most of whom were dressed in their own ways.  I do not recommend this place for youngsters as their minds easily get distracted by people, many of whom come here only to have a ""Good Time""."
Awesome experience,"Enjoyed lovely people and movements of JhulaGreat Boating experience , which coud hav been little cheaper otherwise"
A must see,"A perfect place to watch all the passing traffic go by wether its a colorful indian family, a honking motorbike, or a scrolling cow, the monkey seems to be the one keeping an eye on you."
Unforgettable,"This is like a very important vein in Rishikesh, a place where not only people, scooters, cows cross the bridge but also a place where the monkeys take place to watch the passing traffic. Never boring."
Walking & Gawking,Look around and if you are careful/persistent you might get a good deal.traffic and honking horns are an irritant but can be ignored.do look out for hidden ashrams/temples.
Nice town for Panchakarma,"I stayed in Tapovan, within walking distance to Laxman Jhula, for panchakarma at Maharishi Ayurveda. I enjoyed the ease of walking. Took a while to get used to the street etiquette. If you walk on the left side, let the cows do whatever they want, and have ear plugs for all the honking, the walks are enjoyable."
Fantastic views,"The gangs and the Himalayas foothills adorn the temples,ashram,budget hotels,cafes,restaurant shops all can be seen from this beautiful pedestrian .."
Vacation time,"Loved the bridge and the walk down to bridge via small alleyways surrounded with small shops. It was heavily windy at the bridge but a beautiful experience to walk across the mighty river Ganges! Full of people, walking, singing, dancing. It has the potential to develop as a beautiful hamlet like that of European county side fares, if the authorities and shopkeepers can invest a bit in cleanliness and order.Awesome place to have view of Holy river Ganga, and near by temples and ashrams. Its overcrowded, and on top of that lots of two wheeler uses bridge to cross the River and continuously honks, even though they are not allowed, but nobody there to stop them. So forget you are gonna stand there on bridge in peace. You can use local transport to reach here, or even you can walk from Ram Jhula, while enjoying the shops, local cuisines on the way."
Historical value,Nothing exceptionally remarkable about the place. May be one time visit for historical reasons - that's all!
Must Visit,Super view of mountains and ganga river .. love the german bakery here. sunset time is the best to have tea or coffee here. very peaceful place.
"Well maintained, joining two ends","The Jhula joins two ends of the city, it looks very beautiful in the evening with all the lights lit up."
Fantastic views,"The Ganges and the Himalayas foothills adorn the temples, ashrams, budget hotels, cafés, restaurants and shops, all can be seen from this beautiful pedestrian suspension bridge. Watch out for the fast motorcycles that are not supposed to be there."
Lovely steel bridge,We really enjoyed walking through the jula. We are disappointed that numerous scooters and motorcycles have made this their highway. They have not patience and demand right of way. This needs to stop. Noticed a mother and child walking across the jula and scooters demanding they move. There was no place to move as it was very busy Also think that scooters are being used ad taxis to ferry people across.
Visit to Rishikesh Haridwar,It's at Rishikesh. A bridge on the river Ganga where only two wheeler and people are allowed to walk. While you are walking on the bridge it has effect of jhula ie swing. You can see mountains and river Ganga from the place. Nice place.
Amazing view of Ganga River !,"If you plan to discover the city of yoga, you have to cross the Ganga from the Laxman Jhula Bridge ! You will enjoy a beautiful view of the river surge the mountains all around. But when you will take pictures, be careful with motorbike ! 😉"
A cable stayed bridge with a good view of river below,Its a hanging bridge with steel ropes spanning across the river.Gives a beautiful view of the river ganga below with rafting going on beneath.Beware of the monkeys that might create trouble at times.generally flooded with people and bikes crossing the bridge.
Pool between West and East side of Rishikesh,Good view of ganga riverBeware of 🐵Narrow bridge Both side u get good option for shoppingAnd food 😋
Beautiful bridge.,Very well decorated and well maintained bridge...Good place to take photos........Beautiful view of ganga river from the top of the jhula.
Visited with friends for some leisure out of work and the trip was just wow.Rishikesh is the place to visit for everyone,Visited with friends for some leisure out of work and the trip was just wow.Rishikesh is the place to visit for everyone
Meditation ,This is the place where u can find lot of yoga centres and meditation centres and cafes on both side of the Jhula which serve every kind of vegetarian food and u can sit and relax have a view of river Ganga and can go to the banks to meditate and have peace in life. In the evening we can go to the nearby ashram where Ganga Aarti use to happen every evening from 5 pm and it is famous throughout the world so this place is must visit for people who came for peace and yoga.Best to time visit is in morning and evening.
Lovely view but watch out for the bikes,The bridge provides access and lovely views on either side if the Ganges River.its pretty at night when it lights up. But beware of the passing bikes as this bridge is not only used by pedestrians.
Astonishing beauty!!!,"Astonishing beauty!!! The colours around you,the cows and monkeys plus motorbikes with hundreds of pedestrians in that small bridge at the same moment ...  omg!!! It's an amazing experience!!"
Scenic suspension bridge,We visited the place early in the morning. The place is very scenic and the feeling was very spiritual with a lot of temples and yoga ashrams on both sides of the holy river
Enjoyed,Enjoyed. It's nice to be at Laxman during the evening hours. The environment looks very nice and calm.
Hanging Bridge on Ganges River,It is a very beautiful bridge on Ganga River and lots of temple and restaurant nearby to have a good time.
It's s bridge,"Yes that's right, it's a bridge. A suspension bridge. A suspension bridge that goes from one side of the Ganges river to the other. Yip, it's s bridge."
Hanging Suspension bridge,"Very old Suspension hanging bridge is basically connection between Rishikesh, Tapovan and Swargashram across Ganga River. It’s hestorical bridge in the name of Laxman."
Beautiful Ganges view,"Loved walking on this bridge. Be prepared to join the throngs of people, two wheelers and monkeys while you cross this hanging bridge. The monkeys aren’t the friendly sort, best to let them be. There are rows of shops once you cross over the bridge. You can buy food stuff, beautiful bags, clothes, etc."
Heritage Jhula of Rishikesh,"Rishikesh and Laxmanjhula are inextricably linked. The hanging foot bridge joins the old and new part of the city over the ganges. There are lot of cafes and street shops on both side of the jhula, making the walk extremely intriguing.When you stand on the bridge the cascading river ganga and the rafting boats on the water looks beautiful. A must watch in rishikeshFor more stories on Devbhoomi Garhwal, please visit my blog ramblersnaps.blogspot"
Beautiful site,I was staying in Aloha and decided to walk to Laxman jhula by the banks of Ganges... What a beautiful site.. it's a must visit site in Rishikesh.. Across Ganges it has big market having some good cafe's and souvenir shops. It's a nice walk on bridge....Stand there for a while and feel Breeze...
One of the Best attractions in Rishikesh,It's a well made foot bridge. 2 wheelers do travel on this hanging bridge along with passersby. At night it is well lit and very attractive. Has a lot of eat outs and cafes along side.
Iconic Landmark,"Regardless the travel/sightseeing plans, one will not pass Lakshman Jhula while in Rishikesh and probably won't even coubt multiple crossings of this busy iconic bridge that connects Tapovan area with the other side of Ganges adorned by numerous temples, shops and eateries. Enjoy the stunning views and watch out the cheeky monkies waiting to take a hold of your snacks faster than you think!"
First view,First thing you would want to do afyer reaching this Holy place. The feeling of walking over this bridge is incomparable. And below you can watch holy Ganga flowing with peace.
Love the view ,"The view on Lakshman Jhula is good, you can see the holy Ganga river and all the houses& ashrams alongside the river."
Incredible bridge ,Bridge is almost busy all the time people are passing by walk and by bike and its nice to see cow are relaxing  in the bridge some time.
You have not experienced Rishikesh unless you have walked this landmark  suspension bridge!,"We walked this bridge crossing from one side of the Ganges to the other on our first day of arrival - what a culture shock and wonderful experience!! Mopeds, monkeys, cows, donkeys, dogs and of course people all occupied this fairly narrow bridge, with the hooting mopeds clearly having right of way!"
Ancient bridge in Rishkesh,"Together with Ram Jhula, Lakshman Jhula connects the both sides of Ganga in Rishkesh Lakshaman Jhula was completed in 1929. One of the ancient temples of Rishikesh, Lakshman temple, is located right beside the bridge. As per the legends, Lakshman temple was the place where Lakshman meditated to attain enlightenment. Many people even believe that the jute bridge, now known as Lakshman Jhula, was constructed by Lord Ram, brother of Lakshman."
Must visit place,This is a must visit place in Rishikesh and so beautiful place. I'm sure that travellers will have great experience here.
Bridge to the Beyond,"""The Ganga is flowing, flowing, and flowing, the Ganga is flowing back to the sea. Mother Earth carry me, a child I'll always be, Mother Earth carry me back to the sea."" That's the Rainbow song I keep on singing since two decades while silently walking along the banks of the holy Ganges in Rishikesh of Uttarakhand northern state.Rishikesh, world capital of Yoga, is one of my favourites of India. Since my first visit in 1997 of that mountainous treasure of the ancient Rishis or sages of the Himalayas, attracted as by an invisible magnet, I return there with an indescribable joy for its timeless atmosphere and to meet Yogis and Yoginis from all over the world as well as realized Beings. It's in Rishikesh, at Sandhya (sunrise & sunset prayer time), over Laxman Jhula Bridge, that I've integrated these words of the enlightened master Osho : ""India is not just geography of history. It is not a nation, a country, a mere piece of land. It is something more : it is a metaphor, poetry, something invisible but very tangible. It is vibrating with certain energy fields which no other country can claim. ""When you are meditating, trying to be silent, you are allowing the real India to come in contact with you. You can find Truth in this poor country in a way you cannot find anywhere else. It is utterly poor, and yet spiritually it has such a rich heritage that if you can open your eyes and see that heritage, you will be surprised. (...) this country has been one-pointed, a single goal : how human Consciousness can be evolved to a point where it meets with the Divine; how to bring the human and the Divine closer.""And it is not a question of one person, but millions of people; not a question of a day or a month or a year, but thousands of years. Naturally, it has created a tremendous energy field around the country. It is all over the place, you just have to be ready.""This initiatory journey is eased by the two natural key elements of Rishikesh : the magic Himalayas and the sacred Ganges crossed by two hanging bridges, one in Ram Jhula and the other in Laxman Jhula, 2.5 km distant. Om Namah Shiva!Aseema Om Tara"
Quiet Flows The Holy Ganges!,"Leaving the mountains, the river  appeared serene and beautiful. It's banks carpeted with white sand and boulders of rocks carried by the swift current during the  torrid  summer months seemed enchanting! The rapids of upper Shivpuri gave away to a placid surface, small wirpools faded away swiftly, the winter Sun slowly melted the dews clinging to the leaves, a few seagulls flew over,  the hanging bridge of Muni Ki Reti over the horizon looked like the  mythical bow of Lord Rama. Standing  on the bank of  this  ancient river,  I  closed my eyes! The vision of  a brilliant sky  with whiffs of gentle clouds filled up my mind, the  majestic mountains standing quietly, cold  morning breeze rustling the  leaves,   the faint sound of the waves  crashing on the shore and  an echo of a sacred hymn floated across  the river bed. The  peace and the  tranquility of this holy land  struck a chord deep inside.  A sense of   timelessness and the eternal presence gradually engulfed you in a bliss. Life is beautiful. Random Musings. Muni Ki Reti, Rhishkesh."
Unique experience,"We walked down the joola after the Aarthiand a cup of tea en route. It started to drizzle and was quite dark( around) 7 pm. The joola was lit up, the rain, the darkness, the lights, the temple chants, traffic added to the enchanting experience of walking on the bridge.. The slight sway due to the weight of people and the two wheelers adds to the charm of this unique joola, that connects the two ghats. You can either choose to walk both ways or take a ferry ride one way. We experienced both which made the visit memorable."
Astonishing,I loved this place. Once in a lifetime. Crossed this bridge many times a day to get to the great cafes.
Does the job to cross the river,"Since this bridge and Ram Jhula are the only two bridges in the area to cross the river, you don’treally have many options. But it gets the job done. Many people take selfies on the bridge, and many motorbikes use it to cross the river too right in front of the police eyes, although it’s illegal for them to use it. So it gets very frustrating with scooters honking and sometimes riding very fast."
Good Place,"Place is very nice and from the bridge, you can have an awesome view of nature and nearby ancient temples/buildings"
Lakshman Jhula ,"Loved the bridge and the walk down to bridge via small alleyways surrounded with small shops. It was heavily windy at the bridge but a beautiful experience to walk across the mighty river Ganges! Full of people, walking, singing, dancing."
Worth visit,A pool is made many decades back with interesting mythological story of god Ram. Beware of monkeys there if you carry food with you they will literally attack on you to get the food.
Its the ancient one with beautiful view.,Ganges flowing looks very mesmerizing while standing on this bridge. 2 wheeler is allowed to cross the river as well.
Its the ancient one with mesmerizing location.,We were mesmerized to see the beauty of Ganges while standing on this bridge. You can also cross it using 2 wheeler.
Hanging Bridge,Its one of the most amazing experience and one must experience it will on walking on it.During day time its very much crowded as bikers are also allowed to cross the Ganga.Due to that pedestrains enjoy less while walking .Its been painted by Indian Tri colors.There are many cafes around it one can sit there and enjoy the view
Laxman jhula,Its a bridge with some history.Nothing much to explore apart from few clicks.If staying in Rishikesh..better to visit early hours before the traffic sets in.
The feel - bliss,The feel is absolutely eternal while walking over the bridge. It is crowded by tourists most of the time. But simply divine experience.
layman jhula rishikesh,amazing bridge. it swings in the air...very good feel. The jhula was built many years ago in memory of Lord laxman. I feel so proud standing on the bridge and enjoying breathtaking views of the holi river ganga.
A must!,"Lovely and lively suspension bridge! Scooters, people, cows, dogs, and hungry monkeys! All crossing or just chilling, takind selfies at the same time. Vibrant experience! Just watch those hungry monkeys they can be very aggressive and will grab stuff right out of your hands. Sill very enjoyable and part of the raw Indian experience, love it!"
awesome,we visited here twice. nice place like to visit again and again. very clam. good food nearby nice people nice weather nice everthing
"Very Crowded, Ram Jhoola is better.","While it does seem to be a highly popular destination, the crowds make a visit to this place unbearable. Would suggest the Ram Jhoola bridge as the crowds are better managed there.The view is good as one can see the Ganges gushing down ."
Spiritual ,This is the place one should not miss at any cost if he/she is in rishikesh. The Feeling to cross the  river Ganges is amazing. This is a short bridge compared to ram jhula. Worth the visit!
Beautiful place,Lakshman Jhula is a very nice place. I just love this place. The best part of this place is when the vehicle crosses the bridge it shakes.Must visit.
Hanging bridge and Nice view of Ganges,"The night view of Laxman Jhula on the chilly dark night was beautiful. We spent around 15-20 minutes and walked back to the room.  During daylight, both Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula was very crowded and took time to cross. Taking photographs amidst the crowd was also a challenge. But, the green coloured Ganges flowing beneath makes it most pleasant to see from a height. We spent around 10 minutes in Laxman Jhula."
MOTHER GANGA VIEWS,"Although the bridge is very busy, the views of mother Ganga are breath taking watching the water flow is mesmerising 😊"
Lakshman Jhula,"Lakshman Jhula is a incredible place to visit in Rishikesh area. Surrounded by the foothills of the Himalayas. Unique Spiritual atmosphere with the mystical Ganga river. Many options for accommodation around the area, as well as yoga courses, meditation and more."
Amazing bridge and a great view!,"An amazing experience and one that anyone coming to Rishikesh must have on their 'to do list'. I visited here 10 years ago and the first thing that I noticed on my return is the bridge has had a new paintjob, proudly showing the Indian tri-colours... it now looks even more impressive. Another example of awesome British engineering from a bygone era.The only negative aspect of visiting this awesome landmark is the constant annoyance of ignorant and impatient motorcyclists trying to rush their way across... much to the inconvenience of pedestrians trying to enjoy the moment."
Lakshman jhula,"Situated nearby Ram jhula, this bridge is small when compared with the ram jhula. Looks amazing when lit up in the night."
One of great experience ,"You need to visit it to experience the view. Joins the two banks of river Ganges and is hanging bridge. We did a morning walk here at 6.30am and it was windy, cold but mesmerizing."
Best View of Temples ,Rishikesh visit near to my heart. Loved visiting to Rishikesh as Solo Traveler and enjoying it's beauty. Sure will visit again whenever time permits.
Nice ,Clam place  And spiritual ambience from every where hope to visit soon for pure air and feel maa Ganga ...
nice location but barely meet hyped expectation,this is old bridge on gangaji.  place is nice. when you see photographs on Instagram you have some great expectation about this place. which it failed to meet.
The stunning bridge of Rishikesh,Laxman Jhula is a great bridge to click pictures and make videos. This is one sure shot place to come in your way once you are in rishikesh. The bridge connects two villages and the view is soooo beautuful . The lights which turned on in the evening adds so much to its beauty that you can spend hours and hours looking at it and not get bored. I happend to visit this place for the first time and i was awstruck by its beauty. The river ganga which flows beneath the river is also so adorable . Overall this is a beautifully made structure which shakes and is scary at the same time ..
Crowded but so much fun,"I can’t imagine this bridge not being crowded with people, cows, monkeys and scooters.  Accept that and then enjoy the colourful lively atmosphere surrounded by the most stunningly beautiful views of the Ganges, the Himalayas foothills and the beautiful buildings."
Food consultation and dining,Guest had food consultation and dined after that. Food was sumptuous as per the guest. Thank you for dining with us.
Nice hanging bridge,"It is a nice hanging bridge... build in 1980s... only prblm is the allowance of 2 wheelers... one can't walk properly, peacefully & calmly through this bridges due to 2 wheelers... best time to visit is early morning or late night... best place to enjoy the beauty of Ganges & sun rise... must visit"
Not disabled friendly ,"Lot of steps and poor road to reach .Car has to be parked far away, need to fo lot of walking for someone with restricted walking ability"
Beautifully Lit! ,Place around laxman jhula is happening.. Try to stay in Tapovan if traveling solo or with friends...
Grt Place,"Aitareya support us in providing local employment, organic marketing, a support to nature, a connection to wellbeing and an expansion of wellness. Lakshman Jhula Perfect place for all this subject"
Quieter than Main Rishikesh,"Currently staying in Lakshman Jhula, instead of the main area of Rishikesh. It is quieter, and i find easier to interact with locals. However the place gets swamped at certain times of the year with foreigners coming in fod their teacher training yoga.Still a really cool spot, mainly if you need a calmer place (and better air) after the madness that is Delhi."
Just gotta see it.,"Doesn't matter where you encounter anything about Laxman Jhula, it all comes back to this bridge.  A must experience.  Cows, motorcycles and lots of pedestrians."
"Crowded, And Fun, Just Like Rishikesh!","Glad we took the fun, crowded, somewhat wobbly walk across this bridge, which offers views of nearby temples, markets and, of course, the holy Ganga. You will cross over from one ""village"" to the next (most people consider these two sides to simply be extensions of Rishikesh) with monks, cows, fellow travelers, folks in a big hurry, folks stopping to take selfies and nearly losing their toes to beeping motorbikes. Sounds a lot like the town of Rishikesh, itself! If you go off to the right after crossing the bridge, and walk along the lane that parallels the river towards the Ram Jhula, you will see the ""back road"" sights of artists painting, monks AND monkeys chatting, tiny ashrams, and just simple quietude in this otherwise, busy big town."
Nice experience,One of the main attraction . Evening time lighted .only thing which disappoint is two wheeler passing by .
If only there were no vehicles,"View is beautiful, and very nice for yoga and stuff, I’m sure. But it’d be so much better if you could walk 10 steps without getting impatiently harassed by motorcycle and car horns. It kind of contrasts with the peace of the place. I’ve been there several times, I quite enjoy the view though."
Place to stop and spend time,Since we were passing Rishikesh hence spending time at Lakshman Jhula is must along with some have a look of clean water of Holy river Ganga.. It was beautiful time spending with family
Beautiful,Very old and beautiful jhula which swings as you walk . beautiful walk with cows and monkeys which really look very nice feeling of being in India
"Way far from ""it's just a bridge""!","It's India meshed in some meters.  Monkeys, selfies, cows, motorbikes up and downs... Totally worths visiting!"
View the Ganga flowing beneath,"The hanging bridge is used by people in Rishikesh as a means to cross from one side of Ganga to the other, but it is more of a tourist attraction. People stand all over the jhoola to take photographs, disrupting movement and hence the constant honking by the people on bikes. It is quiet early in the morning and beautiful to view the Ganga flowing, mountains all around."
A must visit,Laksham Jhula is a must visit when you plan a holy trip to Rishikesh.I actually loved the market nearby.
Must visit attraction,I visited Laxman jhula yesterday. A cool breeze was blowing with Ganga maa.. really an incredible experience it was.Want to visit again also a store near to Laxman jhula pashmina world.Which completed my Laxman jhula trip
Divine Intervention on the Jhula,"Highly recommend Lakshman Jhula at 1AM where it is moon lit , no people , chill in the air and you are right in the middle on the Ganges . Just a quite walk on the bridge with an environment like this is surely to give you an experience which is out of the world ""literally"" . The closest you can come to divine intervention . We just happened to reach at that time by pure luck , but that experience stole the show . This very place is full of people during the day which makes it very ordinary but the experience at night just transforms the place . Enjoy the clear sky , night full of stars the moon light the chill in the air and of course the Ganges ...."
Awesome view,It is a 450 feet longan iron suspension bridge situated in Rishikesh in Indian state of Uttarakhand.Lakshman Jhula is one of the most prominent landmarks at Rishikesh.It is made over river Ganges to cross the river and is a landmark ofRishikesh.
Very old and ancient bridge for pilgrimage,This Rope Bridge was installed long back to help pilgrims to cross River Ganga to go to Holy Shrines of Badrinath and Kedarnath . Even now it is great attraction for tourists to visit and move around and enjoy the flowing of the river.Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli
Strong bridge connecting two ends of rishikesh,Its a bridge which is very strong in nature though its a rope bridge it easily displays the strength when its completely flocked with people & the ever menacing two wheeler driversIt shakes a little at your feet when a two wheeler passes you but only at few spots for few to make the adrenaline rushing but overall its a strong structure & you should be cool about walking through itOne needs to use to explore both the sides of RISHIKESH
Historical,It's history still standing tall. The walk on the bridge is very interesting. The shops on either sides are great to pick up souvenirs.
Beautiful ,"Beautiful suspension bridge, the view is good, too muchcrowd but still enjoyable, will come back soon"
Worth it ,"This place is worth a visit and also a stroll across the bridge, you'll find almost everything here from yoga to spas and much more"
"Colors, sounds and movement!!!","Very unique place and unforgettable experience: cross the bridges, many times, and experience the adventure to see motorbikes, cows, monkeys and people all together and in a very fun and intense way. Unique experience!"
It’s a bridvd,"It’s a bridge. It is crowded, has cows, and is painful to cross because of all the scooters and noise and crowding. But around this bridge is the main area for travelers, so pick a side and find a place there"
Morning walk up to Laxman Jhula.,Nice beautiful place.I had a great feeling while crossing Laxman Jhula bridge.The best time to visit is morning.You may enjoy wonderful view of Ganges and many rafting boats sailing in the river.
"Iconic Bridge, can provide you a great view of Ganga at Rishikesh","Again, excessive crowded place. Bikes, Cows & Pedestrian all of them are allowed to use this bridge. Lack of maintenance creates chaos."
Laxman Jhula Rishikesh,We have 2 Healing schools located in Tapovan Laxman Jhula Rishikesh.Maayaa Sound Healing Studio.Maayaa International Healing School
The View 😍,"It's an amazing place to visit! We reach there at 7:00am, less people were there. In the morning the view was amazing.. the mountains, the river.. everything was perfectly perfect. In evening, you hardly get chance to move as the crowd increases at that time. But the place is good and there are some ashrams and mandir near the jhula. You will enjoy it the fullest❤️The pics attached, one is of lakshman jhula and the other one is the view from lakshman jhula!"
One of the jhulas(hanging bridge) across river Ganges ,"Place is really crowded,but a gud place to walk and shop.very difficult to walk as two wheeler rush outVery good place to sit back and relax"
River before sunrise at laxman jhula,"Would recommend to visit the ghats before sunrise. The rivers and adjoining ghats are a completely different place before sunrise.The noise of the blowing wind and the deep silences between the splashes of river water is simply amazing.The experience is so surreal, it calms you from within and one just gets immersed in the nature to become one with the wind,the river and  mountains in the background."
Too crowded,"Must have been a very interesting place earlier, but it's too crowded now. Bikes, Scooters are allowed on this bridge which should be stopped. It has become like a very crowded market."
Disappointed,"Nothing amazing about it as I have already seen this type of suspended bridges in my life so not much amazed about it, but some of my friends were amazed and got frightened as they have seen it for the first time and as you walk over the bridge you can experience the bridge is shaking but as I have already said if you have seen and experienced any suspended bridge then this is worth skipping"
The western side,"There are three areas in Rishikesh – downtown, virtually all local people, Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula.  I saw far more Westerners in Lakshman Jhula Than in town or on the Sivananda side of Ram Jhula.  It is very accessible, scenic, comfortable and fun. Have a lunch at the divine Ganga hotel and take the elevator down To the river."
only for kids,"Nothing amazing about it as I have already seen this type of suspended bridges in my life so not much amazed about it, but some of my friends were amazed and got frightened as they have seen it for the first time and as you walk over the bridge you can experience the bridge is shaking but as I have already said if you have seen and experienced any suspended bridge then this is worth skipping."
So crowded,"Laxman jhoola though is nice but two wheelers are allowed on this. it was heavily crowded and noisy, Horns from two wheelers were totally making it chaotic,"
Very famous bridge,Lakshaman Jhula was very famous bridge and old too. Evening time here was really enjoyable many tourist came here to see.
Hanging Bridge across Ganges a,Famous pedistrian hanging bridge across river Ganga .If not disturbed by two  wheelers would have been better.
A feast for all the senses,"Since my last visit in 1993 Laxman Jhula has turned into a hugely popular and commercial place which offers a huge variety of yogic, ayurvedic, esoteric products and courses."
Holiday ,Crowded but the walk was beautiful in the evening. Look out for the scooters and bikes! That’s all nothing much
Chardhamyatra,Very worst traffic of two wheeler historical bridge with worst maintenance. Very hard to walk only thing historical place to see good temlpe dashavathara. Can be improved a by avoiding the vehicles on the bridge. I Request Foreigners to not to create nuisance by honking on bridge by their two wheelers pl. Thank.
Beautiful Yoga destination ,"Laxman Jhula is a fantastic place to visit for Yoga, meditation, relaxation, white water rafting and more. A perfect first time destination for visitors to India 😍"
Iconic bridge,So great to be here in this lovely place and feel the energy- no where more so or more iconic than the Laxman Jhula Bridge spanning the Ganges.  A beautiful view and intense experience.
Great feel,The bridge is a suspended one. The walk by night is beautiful and pleasant. Caution for the two wheelers who drive very close.
Calming!!,Must be here for the divine enlightenment Ganga Aarti is main thing you should join and feel blessed
Awesome place,Must visit place specially in morning. Cool breeze and awesome Ganges view. When you walk on it you feel the shake as this is supported by wires.
whole world is here ,"apart from the crowd at the bridge everything around the bridge is awesome. people feom all over the world. musicians , meditation type people , yoga , kayakers ,photographers many types of people you will visit. you can see a amazing sunset from the ghats of lakshman jhula ."
whole world in one tiny place ...,"people from the whole world , you can find here . solo traveler , group , family every type you can find here. beaches are full of music lovers , yoga freaks , photographers , some neardy book readers. restaurants are awesome , street food is amazing , hotels , lodges , guest houses from cheaper to higher range . being the witness of sunset from the ghats of laxman jhula must be in your bucket list."
The Famous Lakshman Jhula ,"This Jhula is the most iconic bridge of Rishikesh. Though it is smaller than Ram Jhula, but it gives an amazing view of the nearby mountains. Go there for a morning walk or late night walkTip : Go there before 6.30 am. Trust me , you ll have a completely difference experience - Breezing winds and zero crowd."
Noisy beauty,Beautiful scenery and majestic view of the Ganges. My only irritation is the allowance of scooters on the bridge. The honking of horns echoing in the valley takes away from what should be a very peaceful experience. You should have to walk your scooter/motorbike across the bridge and not ride it.
"Iconic to the area,","If you are visiting Rishikesh taking a walk-about, enjoy the scenery of the mother Ganga, while meandering across the Laxman Jhula suspension bridge."
Walking over the Ganga,"I shall save the statistics for the Wiki and other friends, who have already provided inputs. I shall share our experience.It is wonderful to go over this old hanging Bridge or Joola and to see the Ganga from this height. Of course it is crowded with not just people jostling for space, the jostling needs to be done even with Cows and of course sometimes it is irritating as nobody maintains discipline of going in an aligned manner. But despite all this, you would find the experience enjoyable and the feeling of the bridge moving as you walk on the bridge. It is a nice sight to watch the Ganga flowing from that height. One caution - Please do not walk with any food items on hand as you would invariably find our predecessors (who else but the monkeys) grabbing the visible food and you cannot fight them or win them in this job. Otherwise, it is a good journey from one end to another. In fact the best time would be early mornings just on sun rise (so that you get good visibility of the ganga), where it is not crowded. You can even do a visit late night like say 11 pm or 12 AM, when there is no much crowd.We would have walked the bridge atleast ten times (of course for a purpose)."
Crowded and Scary,"Just walk in the middle on the lakshamn jhula and don't stop in the middle for more than 1 or 2 minutes as it would lead to inconvenience for the other travellers. Overall an experience to have actually, but after 5pm. As the weather is beautiful over the river and the bridge at that time."
"Go for area, view and nearby temple (bridge itself is not special).","Go for the area, Ganges view, monkeys, and nearby temple famous temple. The bridge itself is busy and not very special."
W The Lakshman Jhula is a famous hanging bridge across the river Ganges! ,"The Lakshman Jhula is a famous hanging bridge across the river Ganges! The entire bridge is made up of iron, is 450 feet long and is situated at the height of 70 feet from the river. The Lakshman Jhula is extremely well known amongst tourists because of the rich mythological associations that are connected with the bridge. It is widely believed that Lord Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama, had crossed the river Ganga at this same site, where the bridge now majestically stands for all to see.The construction of the bridge was completed in the year 1929, and presently, the Lakshman Jhula acts as an adjoining bridge across the river, along with the old route to the sacred shrines of Badrinath and Kedarnath. In the present day scenario, the Lakshman Jhula is visited by thousands of tourists each year not just because of its ancient origins and religious sanctity, but also due to the recent developments that have taken place around the bridge. Grand temples and famous markets have sprung up in the vicinity, and the entire area is a now a particularly renowned attraction in entire Rishikesh. Must visit! Be aware that Motorcycle on the bridge can be quite irritating! This attraction is free!"
Scenic view is awesome,"One of prime destination in Rishikesh , scenic view of ganga maa is breathtaking , must visit destination ."
Suspension Bridge across River Ganges at Rishikesh,"Built in 1929 this iconic landmark of Rishikesh spans 450 feet across the River Ganges. It's a walkway bridge 6 foot across (carriageway), but small scooters also cross. Visited in 2012."
Wow A beautiiiee. Amazing Build. ,It was my first experience to touch lakshaman jhula. I have heared about it many times before.Its builtup is amazing. Great place to see and visit. I stay near by and been Many times but couldn't get chance to see it.. Puja in evening were awesome. I just felt blessed by God there. So nice and beautiful. Water was very fast moving but they had made safety gate also. Even there are people to protect somehow.Food all these areas were great and a traveller cannot be empty stomach if he visit the places.Me and my friend were taking rounds of it. Beside jhulla there was ashram amazing.Its a nice place to stay and get meditation done.
A must do,"The bridge itself is an experience. By night is beautifully lit. The bridge gets very busy around 5ish due to all the locals rushing to get temple. Bikes, people, animals all cross this bridge in droves. Be prepared if your white and a woman to expect lots of locals taking photos."
