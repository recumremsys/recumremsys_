Nothing to see,"Unless you're coming here with the intention of praying, don't bother. It's a proper functioning temple, and what that usually means is that it isn't well maintained and can get quite dirty. Not worth the visit."
Average temple and architecture,"We went there after visiting the Saas-bahu temple which is situated just behind this temple. We were early and joined in the queue for those people doing prayers.

Short and sweet`,Similar to Khajuraho - though much smaller -  this is a very enjoyable temple to visit.   Doesn't take long - it's small - and most of the faces of the deities were hammered off by the Mughul invaders so it's not as photogenic.  Worth a visit

Beautiful & celestial Shiv Temple!! Must Visit for History/Monument lovers,"Eklingji is Shive temple, ruling deity of Mewar and the Maharana's ruled as Dewan to Lord. Its history dates back to 8th century, Like all other temples this too was destroyed,15th century it was rebuilt on the ruins, the architecture will simply marvel you, granites & marbles uses.The beautifully sculpted complex includes 108 temples within its premises, though all were not accessible for tourist/pilgrims I guess..(Yea tourist, non hindus allowed here),Do not skip this if you love the art/architecture; the location is pleasing too."
Family place,Holy temple environment.Life looks cool when you are this place. People are very caring and food is awesome.

Overall the campus has 108 temples and the main shivling is huge with beautiful carving.Photography is not allowed inside the campus. Do check for the timing before you visit.Must visit
Holy Shiva Temple,This holy Shiva temple is somewhere around 400 years old. A bit far but worth a visit. It comes on the way to Nathdwara temple. So both can be covered on the same day.
Beautiful temple complex,"We had visited Ekling Ji Temple, which is a beautiful temple complex during our trip to Udaipur. The temple complex has high walls and big iron gates at the entrance and looks more like a fortress. The main temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and has beautiful intricate sculptures on the walls and pillars. A giant statue of the Nandi is present outside the main temple. The temple complex has many small temples also dedicated to the Lord. We had visited around 1 pm in the afternoon and were lucky to witness the aarti of the Lord amidst loud chants by devotees."
Wow,One of the oldest temples of the country with a rich history........ Small but majestically built......No touts trying to fleece
Jai Ekling Ji,Its very good palace towards to Sreenath ji temple. its just 20 minute drive from udaipur. it is temple of Shiv shankar. you should visit once if you are in udaipur.
Famous Temple and Fix timings,This is very famous temple in way from Udaipur to Nathdwara. This has got very good arts and shows history.
Spiritual Home of the Maharanas of Mewar Udaipur,This is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is really ancient and is very peaceful. They say this is the spiritual home of the Maharanas of Udaipur for whom Eklingji is the Patron God or Family Diety. It is a rather small temple so tends to get crowded quite fast. but the entry-exit is well organised. We liked the serenity of the place. It is about 25-30 kms away from Udaipur so you need to have a car or hire a cab to get here. We hired a cab. A round trip deal is best as you may not get a cab easily there to get you back to Udaipur. .
Most peaceful known temples jn India,It is such a beautiful temple and so organised. There are no long queues. The visit was a very peaceful visit. My parents were very happy how everything went so well.
A trip back in time,"The temple awed us by the very fact that it is so ancient. A calm and soothing ambience.Fortunately not overcrowded on the day we visited so we could sit peacefully in the temple. 30 minutes drive from lake Pichhola ,the taxi to and fro charged us 1000 INR but it was worth it. And don’t forget to try the mirchi pakoras being sold outside the temple."
The most peaceful temple,"We visit this temple at least once every year. & it's 1 of the few temples where I look forward to going. It's very soothing to sit here while the live musicians are playing Shiv Kirtan here. If you cherish architectural marvels & peaceful places, you must go here."
108 temples in 1 temple. Nice!,"Great place to be at, not all 108 temples are open for all, some of them are reserved for royalty and general public is not allowed. They won't let you take your bags inside and has lockers outside (best is to keep your bags and phones in your car) try to do it in early 1st half of your day or late second half as floor gets too hot when sunny."
lord shiva temple,"about an hr's drive from udaipur, this falls on the route to srinathju. managed very well by the administration and a very beautiful place."
Ekling Ji Temple,Ekling Ji Temple is a historical temple of Lord Shiva. need some maintenance to this place. peaceful place . this is almost 600 years old temple. architecture was good.
Visited early in the morning. serene and divine surroundings.,A must visit place. not well advertised but its unimaginably beautiful ancient temple with a very deceiving simple facade! Very well managed and maintained interiors will impress everyone with divine ambiance.
Great Architecture,"The place is worship place of Lord Shiva and is at least 600 years old. The place has great architecture and too see the building build back centuries ago.  Some of the places of this temple are restricted and are not allowed to normal public, would have give 5 star if Udaipur…"
Holy Place with Positive Vibes,Awesome historical architecture of temple. We were not aware that the temple open for specific hours so had to wait for some time. Make sure to check the open hours before visiting.   Har Har Mahadev!
Good Ancient temple,Around 1 hour travel from Udaipur via NH. Temple opens at sharp 10.30AM. Queue was there but the darshan was good. 
One of the most popular and religious centes of Udaipur,"Eklingji Temple is one of the most popular and ancient religious centers of Udaipur, which is located approximately 24 km from the main city. The temple is devoted to Hindu Lord Shiva, and it is believed that Acharya Vishvarsupa built it in 734 AD. There are 108 temples in this…"
Divine place,"I am nobody to review Shri Ekling Ji Temple. But if in Udaipur don't miss the oppurtunity, though its little on the outskirts but still never far enough for blessings. Its Centuries old temple devoted to Shiv Ji, its private property Prince of Mewar ."
my udaipur tour,ekling ji temple is built  by maharaj of mewar ago 1400 year old and worshiped by royal family you must see the ancient temple of lord shiva just 30 mins drive from udaipur  the temple is intersting and has a good architecture
Ancient temple on the way,Ekling Ji temple is the personal temple of the Maharaja of Mewar and is very ancient. It is open only for very limited time and visit should be well planned. The temple is not usually crowded and is very good. Must visit.
The Ancient Royal temple,"One hours Run by car from Udaipur city is the Royal temple of Eklingji. Believed to be 1400 years old idol and worshiped by Royal family , The temple is wonderful in Architecture structure .Visitors are requested to check the Timings because it is closed for at few interval   For  darsan.  Tough  not much tourist spare time to visit this temple but the visit is worth if your Hindu devotee as it is on the way to  Shreenath Ji or Nathdwara."
Lord Shiva Temple,Ekling Ji Temple is historical temple.Very attractive temple and spiritual feelings.There is always crowd during pick season.
Lovely,"If you ask me , this is a beautiful haven . One must visit . Not for the gods but for the inner peace one gets here !!"
The Lord shiva's Temple,It's a lovely temple of Lord shiva.  You feel inner peace in the temple. It's a must visit place who is visiting Udaipur.
Visited early Jan 2019,"Had visited this temple twenty years ago when it was a peaceful quiet place. Now very crowded but structurally good. Strict security regulations - no bags allowed, mobiles to be switched off, no socks even."
Beautiful & Peaceful ancient Mandir...,Eklingji Mandir is close to Udaipur and a must visit place. Very calm & quite place. Four facet Shiva in black marble is the main attraction.
Religious and architecture ,Good ace to visit to observe old Indian temples which are still. Active Crowded but manageable For tourists be prepared for lots of people in close quarters I would also suggest keeping belongings close Shoes are taken off for entry so wear slip ons
Well maintained Shiva temple,Very old temple still maintained by the mewar foundation. Very clean with high security. No photography allowed. They are very strict in it. The main diety was very beautiful.
A must See place,"You must see the ancient temple of Lord Shiva. Just 30 mins drive from Udaipur. Apart from the temple, you can see the lake, from where you can take photograph of the entire temple."
Good ancient temple,The temple is interesting and has a good architecture. The vibes are positive and its a nice place to visit.
Architectural masterpiece,"Keeping aside the religious angle, this temple is an architectural masterpiece. A collection of 108 small temples, ekling had the most amazing stonework and stone carving. If one does pay attention to the detail of the stonework here, one is like to really get blown away. Being close to Udaipur I strongly recommend that those interested in history, architecture and mythology take this short trip. Really worth a visit."
Well managed.,"Well managed temple by the management, it is neat & clean, must visit. The staff, priest all are helpful."
Appreciate the Religion ,A great example of the many temples .A must quick stop . But key is to take a guide in order to enjoy the history and the context
Orderly queues,"Very historical temple.  Very well maintained..  Orderly queues and no pushing or jostling..we went on Monday and though it was crowded the crowds moved fast in a orderly manner..socks,shoes and handbags and cell phones are prohibited"
Ancient Siva temple worth a visit ,"This is an ancient Siva temple situated 30 odd Kms from Udaipur . Maintained by the current King , it's a protected site and the deity in the form of 4 faced Sivalingam is still worshipped with devotion . The faces depict , Brahma, Vishnu ,Mahesh and Sun . Very powerful temple with elegant architecture depicting the Rajasthani style at those times . A must visit"
clean quiet temple,"very quiet clean temple, ancient and good carving, can be a good spot if spiritual places interest you."
Worth a visit!,"This is a fairly large temple complex. It does not appear to be as large when looking at it from the outside. As with most temples we visited, you have to remove your shoes and socks. We went in December so it was a little cold and uncomfortable. However, that being said, we did enjoy the visit."
Serenity ,"Ekling ji is diety of mewar. It is worshipped equally by all. It's a form of Lord shiva. The temple is clean , nice , calm . When in udaipur  pls pay a visit there and get blessings. Do check the timings of temple before going."
Religious site with some temple architecture,The entry and place is typical of other Indian temples. Its on a crowded road in a small village quite far off from the town . It has cultural and religious significance to Udaipur population but as a tourist it can be avoided completely. This lands up as the top place to visit only due to it religious significance and best to avoid. The better place to see is the nearby Sas-bahu temple which hardly has any tourists and  has  exceptional architecture.
Ancient Shiva temple,One needs to plan the visit to coincide with the timings. This is an ancient Shiva temple. This can be covered on the way to Kumbhalgarh Fort (this is located on the way) and is not covered by the travel companies as a part of the local sightseeing tours. This can alternatively be combined with Haldighaati and Nathdwara temple visit.
Quick Visit ,"One to see for a quick visit. No entrance fee, not many tourists and with the exception of the flowers by the entrance nobody is trying to sell you anything. They have retained the principle of no photos so no cameras / mobiles are allowed inside of the temple."
Historical monument worth a visit,It's a nice short visit from udaipur. The temple complex is beautiful but we are not allowed to visit other shrines - quite sad.They don't allow any bags inside locker is available outside. No cameras allowed too.
Real old and grand carving,This is an old temple. Very serene despite the crowd. The carvings are amazing. Really feel great to visit the Aradhyay deity of the rajputs.
Interesting temple,"Interesting temple with so many shines. Much of the complex is closed off but what you can see is impressive. No photography, and plenty of flowers to buy on way in. Some interesting stalls on the outside."
Must go,"On our way to Nathdwara from Udaipur,  we had darshan of Eklingji, presiding deity of Rajasthan.  Please check the temple timings before you go. People stood in line,  well organised, thankfully no pushing. There are more mandapams in the rear of the deity,  but no access.  But one can still see them from distance.  Mobile phones and hand bags are not allowed inside."
The ruling god,Eklingji is the god who ruled mewad since centuries. Mighty maharanas were and are obedient assistants to him. A must visit place hardly few kms away from udaipur
must visit,"Not just for the religious, this offers a great historical and architectural insight in the past, and culture of the region."
I wouldnt make a special trip out to see this temple,This temple was ok. A lot was not accessible to look at. I have visited better temples. It is an important stop for people with hindu faith
The Five Faced Shiva Lingam!!!!!,This temple is located on outskirts of Udaipur. It is a big area and nicely maintained. It is not crowded
Visit to Ekling ji Temple,"This temple is situated about 20 kms outside Udaipur and is the personal temple of the Royal family of Mewar. It is opened for public darshan for a few hours starting at 10.30 am. Avoid Mondays as the Maharaja comes on Mondays for offering puja. For good darshan be there by about 10.15 and be the first to enter. It is a small temple and crowds are large. It has a beautiful Shivling and though a small temple the stone carvings on each stone are very DEEP and EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL. A very peaceful temple, its a pleasure to visit this temple but one cannot stay too much time in this temple since it is small and crowds are moving."
Great temple architecture!,One of the loveliest temple architecture here.Do visit for some great scenic views of the temple. Loved the pakoras and tea outside the temple ;-)
Nice temple,Nice temple. Worth visiting. Not crowded and you can do the darshan in 15 mins. You have to keep your bags in a locker just after entering the temple which is safe.
Stunning n breathtaking ,Serene and breathtaking..the 5 faced Shiva lingam and surrounding temples leave You in awe of the architecture.  However now parts are closed to the public and with the new highway to Nathdwara one has to take a detour to visit the temple
"Beautiful, superb temple","Heritage, historic and incredible civil engineering with some religious touch to the place. It has more than 100 temples over all at one place with deities of different gods in every temple. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Must visit Temple (if you love old architecture),"On my way from Udaipur to Jaipur I went to this temple, Where the Architecture is wonderful.Worth visiting this  peaceful place."
Nice Shiva Temple,We visited this place in Nov 2018 - the temple is located outside Udaipur and we visited the sames on our way from Nathdwara to Udaipur - you would need to take a slight detour from the main highway. The temple closes at 1.30 pm for morning darshan. We just made it in time for darshan. The architecture of all the temples within the complex is very good. There were no crowds on the day we visited - so no lines etc. We walked straight in and had a lovely darshan. The temple is maintained by the royal family.
SHIVA TEMPLE  51 LINGAMS,IT is a good to visit if you are with your individual car or cab. On the side way While going from JAIPUR to UDAIPUR. After this you can se SAAS BAHU include these are  ancient  ruins.

Lord Shiva Temple Eklingji!,Happened to stop at Eklingji Temple while on our way to Udaipur from Jaipur via road and reached the temple just at the time for the evening Aarti.

Main temple of Udaipur ,It’s a very huge temple which was one of the foundation stone of the Udaipur city . The present king still pays a visit every week . It’s very peaceful inside and has a lot of ancient archeology . Highly recommend .
Superb place !,We went here with family in September. This is big religious place in this area and even if you are not follower its good to visit this for experience. We went on weekend so it was really crowded.We paid extra for skipping fees lines and getting Aarti done from front. It was nice experience for us.There are also shops nearby Temple to get some pooka stuff or some other stuff to take back home..
Precious history,"The temple is about 30 minutes drive from Udaipur. Fairly busy, clean and well-maintained. The facilities to store shoes and the lockers to keep purses etc were convenient and reliable. It is not much to look at, but when you remember the history of this temple and how significant it was to the great kingdom of Mewar, you are bound to get goose-bumps."
Great tample,It’s a historical tample. This tample belongs to Mewar Monarchy. In their believes Shri Eklingi Nath ji is King of Mewar. And King is Feewan if Shri Eklingi ji.

Classic Heritage temple - a must go,Black Stonne temple is said to be built in 8th Century. Visited this marvelous temple of Lord Shiva in December End of 2017. The temple is made up of Black and White stones. At places black stones are very cold and at the same time you find quite warm white stones on floor.Most of the are of temple is closed and is accessible only on MahaShivratri. But otherwise also the temple resembles the rich carving on stones and reminds strong architecture knowledge of that era.

"Well organised place, interesting architecture",We entered the temple complex around 10 am in December and it wasn't too crowded.

Shiva temple with 108 shrines inside,"Nice temple to visit, it is 3 km from the Udaipur-Nathdwara four lane highway. Rush is well managed by temple authorities, but avoid peak season. Do not take bags inside the temple. Though there is cloak room which is free, mostly they may not be available due to their limited number. Mobiles could be kept in pocket, but photography is prohibited."
Do's and Don'ts ,"Please note that photography and videography is strictly prohibited in the premises of the temple.Shoes can be kept in the shoe stand(no fee) at the entrance.All bags and other stuff can be kept in lockers provided at the entrance(no fee).Better to leave all the above in ur car.Parking charges are minimal.This place is pretty close to sans bahu mandir as well.

The sculptures of Lord Shiva are very beautiful..There are private guards who guide through the entry ..the place is divine and is perfect for worship, thats why this was private place of worship of queens.."
Very old temple but worth visiting!,The temple is beautifully constructed centuries ago but still in its shape and colour. Situated on the national highway before Udaipur not to be missed visiting and experiencing.
Awesome awesomeness,"Some places are unique. And I think I can state this is one of those places. You can certainly find some more beautiful Indu Temples than this one but it is difficult to find one with more religious significance and authenticity. This is a very special Shiva Temple where the God is represent by a four faced linga. I was lucky to get there at a time where the linga was being washed with milk and sat inside for some time participating in the human celebration around it, not in terms of their believes, as I am not a religious person, but certainly in terms of their aw and inspiration.Not another foreign was to be seen during the one hour visit and also no tourists in the area nearby. Like in middle ages European Temples a myriad of dreamlike characters gather around the temple: beggars, all sorts of handicaped people, animals and pilgrims. A wonderful, mystical experience.A word of advice: you either love it or hate it profoundly. Unless you really care for this kind of experience do yourself and others a favor: stay far from places like this and keep your prejudice away. No photos allowed inside the temple."
Beautiful ancient ,A very beautiful ancient temple this reminds us of the beautiful India of yester years. It is marvellous in terms of its ancient architecture

Sarat ,Eklingji temple is located about 25 km from Udaipur.  We started around 9 am reached the place by 10.15 am. The temple kept open from 10.30 am for Darshan.  We had ver good darshan of Lord Mahadev.  The temple is maintained very well and no mobiles are allowed.  We thoroughly enjoyed the serenity.  the bhajans sung by the team are really melodious.
Awesome temple!,Be here in the morning when it is still dark at around 5am and after 6pm in the evenings - one of the quietest places and you would love to sit here and enjoy the peace!
Not well maintained ,"In terms of architecture, it’s nice, but not well maintained- the outer surfaces of the temple need cleaning...Photography is strictly prohibited inside the temple premises. I went in the evening at 5 PM and even though it was not crowded, the guards hurried us up and did not really allow us to take a good look inside the main temple. So my suggestion would be that if you are going there for religious reasons then it’s fine, but from a tourist point of view it was big disappointment for me."
Amazing architecture,Its one of the finest temples I have come across.Beautifully built and maintained.Though there were not many people when I visited and that gave my family ample time to spend a good time there.
Beautiful temple,This temple gives immense peace when visited...please visit once when on udaipur tour..Outside the temple there is local market where you can have meals..

We had learnt so much about the temple and Bappa Rawal (its founder) in the Light and Sound show the previous day, we just could not miss visiting the place itself. Our experience of this temple was unique as we reached there before dawn at 5 in the morning and witnessed the magical morning ‘Aarti’ of the deity. Beautiful flower decorations and peaceful chants surely makes its way to one’s soul.Tip – Temple has specific timings for the devotees and photography is not allowed."
