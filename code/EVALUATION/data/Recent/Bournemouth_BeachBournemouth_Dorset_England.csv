"Sand, sand and more sand","Beautiful bournemouthA very pleasant surpriseHow refreshing for walkers, runners, cyclists, bladers et al to enjoy the seafront."
Absolutely beautiful! ,"Bournemouth beach is gorgeous. Very clean, lots to see and so. Loads of nice places to eat. Perfect beach 😊"
Just beautiful ,Just beautiful A lovely walk on a lovely beach no matter what the weather throws at you well worth take this lovely place
Great,We walked along the front liked that it was Pedestrian only area had a walk round pier and just sat and watched the sea and people recommend it
Nice beach but need help for the rough sleepers,"Beach was lovely and clean during the day possibly due to the time of year with fewer people on the beach. Meet a lovely local lady walking her dogs, Harley and lucky who was friendly and lady was extremely warm and made us feel welcomed with tips on where to park and best places to eat. In the evening, saw a few rough sleepers and some drug taking in the huts, the council’s homeless outreach team should really visit these areas in the evening and offer help, support and accommodation. Is definitely worth a visit during the summer but please help the homeless and rough sleepers"
Stunning ,"We had the best time just sitting up on a terrace at one of the beach restaurants the weather was amazing 34 degrees which made the trip for us. We walked along and saw all the lovely beach huts, it was so refreshing to be away from the madness of Covid . Just out in the fresh air and not a sight of anyone wearing a mask! The weather made it for us and the beautiful scenery, also great to see so many dogs out too! It all made up for the terrible experience had at the Dudley Dean hotel ! Avoid at all costs, the owner Paul Faesey is one of the most condescending liars  I’ve ever come across.  ! I will definitely be back to enjoy the sights of Bournemouth!"
Beautiful ,"Such a beautiful beach, love it when the weather is good I enjoy getting the paddle board out and going for a swim. Can get very busy and traffic/parking can sometimes be annoying but once your there it's perfect."
Sprawling sands,"Beautiful sandy beach which goes on for miles and miles whether your  walking, swimming , surfing or catching some rays it is stunning in all seasons"
Clean beach ,"Great beach , clean and no rubbish evident . Well cared for by the council if only all beaches were the same ."
Lovely walks along the seafront,"Lovely golden sands and great walks along the seafront, plenty of photo opportunities with surfers and cruise ships."
Fantastic can’t wait to go again ,Great place to be . Can not fault this place was amazing. Will be going back was the best ever holiday in the UK I’ve had .
Clean beach ,We had a lovely long walk along the coast a brisk wind and crashing waves made it an enjoyable afternoon
Very rainy bleak day,"The weather was awful but I could see this was a splendid beach, especially so close to the town and uni."
Beautiful Bournemouth beaches,"Beautiful clean beaches well managed, staff on the beach were helpful and polite. Well maintained zig zag walkways down to the beach at good intervals, refreshments available, 2 piers with interactive things for kids of all ages"
Stunning,"Wow, didnt expect a beach in England to be so exotic,we loved it, so beautiful clean relaxing. Can't wait to return and bring the kids."
A large sandy beach,The beach is large and sandy. There are free public toilets and plenty of cafes and restaurants next to the beach. It seemed clean when we were there.
Very clean ,One of the best beaches I have been to in England. Very clean and water is so nice if you are going in summer.
Very clean,This is a very clean beach. Plenty of seats on the promenade to sit and relax. There are lots of beach sheds over looking beach
Lovely sandy beach.,"Sat on beach for 4 days between 21 to 26 Sept, sun was lovely, when it went behind the cloud was a bit chilly..The 5 cruise ships could be seen moored... At chine beach, drinks, food, ice cream and toilets available, you have to pay for parking."
Walks along the beach,"It was a sunny day and the views were lovely. We did enjoy walking along the beach where dogs were allowed and having a paddle with her. We walked along the promenade where dogs weren’t allowed on the beach.The beach is divided into dog walking areas, surfing areas, barbecue areas (after 6).I have given a score of 3 because there was one thing that really spoiled it for me and that was litter.The council men work hard to keep the promenade clear and do a great job but such a job is difficult on the sand where the main source of rubbish is cigarette ends, filter tips stuck in the sand, it really turns my stomach. it mainly occurs where people gather, barbecue areas are the worse affected and can go a fair way down to the beach. The other parts affected are close to the promenade where people sit on the edge with their feet on the sand. Why people do this I really don’t understand, really spoiling a really lovely place."
Great visit ,"Stay in Bournemouth for a long weekend and had a walk along to beach as the hotel over look the beach, was very clean and nice!"
Evening stroll,Love Bournemouth beach walk especially on a warm evening. Most people were being Covid safe but there where a few groups of over 6 on the beach.
Short break,Luckily we had beach weather for the first 2 days. We walked along the front to Boscombe beach and that was not too busy so social distancing was easy. On return to Bournemouth pier area later in the afternoon the brach was packed with students who were not practicing social distancing.
Lovely sandy beach,I could not get on to the beach as I was in a wheelchair but lovely for families as all sand very hilly but plenty of shops and a pier
Sandbanks .. dogs beach ! ,Lovely stretch of beachfront for dogs ! Dog wash station in the carpark too. ! Highly recommended for dog lovers ... and their dogs.
Miles of beautiful sand. Facilities for all,What a fabulous beach. We have just come back from a long weekend break and the weather was hot on all days. We stayed very near the pier at the Hermitsge hotel which is a 2 minute walk to the 7 mile beach . Beautiful sand and plenty of bars and food cafes and restaurants right down by the beach. Lifesavers In their lookout building gave everyone a reassuring feeling of safety. We could safely stay at a comfortable difference as the beach is so large . There were two sets of toilets that were reasonably clean. All in all this is a fabulous place to come to and we look forward to seeing Bournemouth again in 2031
Nice sand,"Visited with my partner for a walk along the beach. Sand was quite nice and the beach area a good size. There was nothing that made it great, it was just nice."
Stench of marijuana ruins it,"Ive always loved Bournemouth and its beautiful dog friendly beaches but its been spoilt by cheap eating kiosks at expensive prices. Love the beach huts but the vile stink of marijuana from the beach and certain people walking was too much. I've had many holidays as a kid and many happy memories but won't go back again. The surrounding areas of Christchurch, Mudeford and Westbourne made up for it"
Amazing ,Lovely place to visit very good with social distancing I spent hours here and would go again lots of ice cream  chips and lovely weather
Relaxing ,Lovely beach very clean. There is lots to go round there with the wheel and the zip wire. Very busy on the weekend
My home,"I couldn’t ask for better place to stuck at during the lockdown, then this place. Best is the bicycle or beach volleyball."
Great beach,Dropped in for a week to an AirBnB flat and walked the beach. Great expanse of mostly rock free sand with breakwaters. Much better than we expected. Pleasant walks with most people keeping distant.
Spotless beautiful stunning ,Spotless place well kept life guards security patrols plenty of places to eat and drink bbq allowed in evenings highly recommended
Beautiful beaches,"Lovely sandy beaches, really busy when we visited but am totally impressed by the cleanliness, no rubbish to be seen anywhere.  No sunbeds available due to Covid so took own chairs."
Swim in the sea was amazing ,Visited the beach & was so impressed we felt like we was abroad. So clean & could see our feet in the water. Good amenities nearby & enjoyed a fab cornish pasty for lunch
Lovely!,Was really nice but no one was social distancing but you could just visit when it’s not as busy! Personally didn’t feel it was awful so it’s nothing to worry about! People were wearing masks. Was very clean and kept looking nice.
Miles of Golden Sand,Came here 50 years ago on family holidays but couldn't remember just how wonderful this beach is. Come on down and check it out for yourself.
Beach,"Beautiful beach and lovely sand, plenty of room for social distancing ,and safe with lifeguards watching .plenty of cafes  around to have some lunch"
Beach,"The beach is beautiful and well maintained, lots of space for family’s to keep social distancing, and lifeguards there to keep everyone safe."
Lovely beach nice and clean very long if you like to go for a walk. There are some cafes along the beach front. ,Lovely beach it’s super long nice to go for a walk. It’s kept clean and tidy. When I was here the weather was lovely which makes a big difference
Awesome beach,Fantastic beach. Very clean and family friendly. Everyone was social dii to standing too so it felt safe
Pleasant picnic on the beach,"The beach was lovely, the facilities were clean. There were plenty of signs for social distancing, it wasn’t too busy and therefore very pleasant."
Understood its hype,"Always was thinking why half of London escapes to this beach on a sunny day. A huge sandy beach, waters clean and calm, very good for families, a lot of cafes, clean public toilets. Definitely would think of it as the most accessible and first choice beach if live in London or near. Beach could be extremely crowded though, NHS sign telling to go home if it like this. In mid Sep during a heat wave (+25) it was still ok to swim, however water was chilly."
Dogs Should be Allowed,Easily one of the UK 's best beaches. We'll maintained and plenty of facilities.. Just wish there were more dog friendly areas.
Nice walk ,Lovely clean beach. Spacious to walk in. Even has a path way should you not want to walk on the sand.
Few days away,"Beautiful Sandy beach, very clean, lots of restaurants opposite,to eat and look out to to sea, also lots of benches in case you don't want to sit on the sand"
Lovely long stretch of sand,Near to the town the beach is a long sandy beach just off the promenade. Just out to sea there is a cruise ship moored up. At night it is all lit up
Clean & quiet,Lovely and clean as it’s coming to the end of the season. Lots of places to eat and sit. Plenty of public toilets.
Beautiful beach ,Excellent sandy beach. Very clean and lovely restaurants near by. Tasty fish and chips. Fresh ice-cream
weekend,"A very clean & safe beach it stretches for miles. very good access to the town etc. sea clean , life guards on hand"
Gorgeous Beach,"Beautiful beach easily accessible, fantastically clean, good facilities. Great beach. Plenty of things to do amusements, oceanarium, Bournemouth wheel. Plenty of places to eat can recommend Aruba bar serves food all day, reasonably priced."
Great beach,Beautiful beach lovely soft white sand. We walked fro Bournemouth beach along to sand banks. Lovely walk that took a little over an hour. If you want to break it up there are many places to stop for a drink and lots of WC’s along the route too.
Birthday weekend,We walked one day to Sandbanks and back and the next day to Southbourne. Both areas along the coastal path were fantastic walks and views
Beautiful Beach,"Stunningly beautiful golden sandy beach which seems to stretch for miles...also this has  ""dog friendly"" year round certain sections of beach (we used area 7)  which our dogs loved the chance to swim in the sea.. First time we have been to Bournemouth beach and must say we loved it!"
Lovely beach 🏖️,"It is all sand, clean and huge - meaning you can spread out. There is a good selection of shops, food places, and entertainment around the beach. It also offers some beautiful views of the sea - which is stunning on a hot sunny day 😊"
Beautiful beach and very clean.,"The best beach in South England, incredible walks along the promenade and cliffs, social distancing not adhered to as much as we had hoped."
Beautiful ,It’s a beautiful large beach spoilt by all the people who are able to take food and drinks to the beach but are unable to take the rubbish back with them. Dogs should be banned together with loud music A fantastic place to spend a day or two in the sun move away from the pier to get away from the noise
Lovely Sandy Beach,"Beautiful beach, with pier and promenade. Plenty of places to get ice cream and teas. Has an area for dogs"
Clean sandy beach,Very clean and sandy beach. Beach huts are available by the beach. There is a road by the beach for people to walk from one end to other not necessarily on the soft sand. I had been during the week so the beach wasn't busy. Weekend I heard its quiet busy
Beach Life,"This a lovely sandy beach with many facilities, one of the few traditional beach resorts in England that still thrives and because of this, it is very busy. You notice it more if you have come along the coast from Poole & Sandbanks as we had.With the town a short walk away, it is always popular. The pier has been maximised with attractions, just a shame they charge you to walk along it (although understandable for running costs) but I come from a seaside town that lets you use it for free."
Beach in Bournemouth,The beach is Nice and clean with Phew bars restaurants And very important toilet facilities.A pier to walk out on offering great view .is good beach for kids and relaxing 😎
Sandy beach,A lovely long sandy beach. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is down to the fact you have to pay to go onto the pier.
Our time,"Beautiful weather has meant that we spent a good part of our visit at the beach.  Nice, clean and not to crowded."
Clean  White Sandy Beaches for Miles,"It was our first time on holiday in Bournemouth and we had no idea what to expect. You access the beachfront in a quite compact central area where the pier is located. The beaches of beautiful White Sand spread out on either side of the Pier and seem to go on for miles. you can either walk along the pedestrian pathway or dip your toes into the sand and use the sand as your walkway. At the time we visited there were quite a few activities including the big wheel just off the beachfront, an aerial runway that runs between the pier and the beach and the usual beach sports including volleyball. On the first occasion we visited the beach rain mostly stopped play except for the die hard surfers the waves were quite large and amazing to watch. There are rental beach huts close to the pedestrian walkway facing towards the beach. Later in the week the Sun Appeared and it was nice and warm which in turn made the Beach Busier however it was not overcrowded and people did maintain social distancing. Regarding amenities these are only around the central area near the pier. I did not see any amenities along the sections of beach which extended away from the pier.I have to say it was a real shame to see several cruise ships moored offshore and clearly going nowhere."
Lovely beach,"Lovely beach, clean with many facilities. Go towards Boscombe and the number of people reduces dramatically. In a sunny Tuesday in September we were the only people there!"
Day trip,"On of beautiful sandy beach in the United Kingdom. Car park is bit expensive.  Thanks .....,,,,,,,,??)£££&&!??))?)))))))),;6)"
Great for a weekend,"Lots to do! Shops, bars, restaurants, arcades, icream ship, Aquariam, clubs, hop on hop off busses. Really beautiful garden too. You can easily spend a weekend here."
Stunning sandy beach,Sandy beaches that gone on for miles. Lots of little shops to eat and drink. Just absolutely beautiful 😊
Great beach,"SocIal distance was fab on the beach, amusement arcades good, kids enjoyed fish and chips on beach 😀"
Love the colour of the sea,It was not crowded and we were able to have a nice peaceful walk there enjoying the nice colour of the sea and the nice beach.
Great Safe Beach,Lovely beach. Very clean and great facilities available nearby. Very soft sand !! Lifeguards on duty all of the time.
Lovely,"The beach itself is lovely. There were a lot of nice people there. The only cons are that it’s a bit too windy and the water is kind of cold. Overall, I had a lovely experience in Bournemouth."
Sandy beach ,"Beautiful gold sandy beach, clean and dog friendly as well from bay 7 till 5 only, which is absolutely amazing our dogs have loads off fun out there. Drinks and food is not expensive as well, loads off places to eat as well. Highly recommended"
Always clean and beautiful ,"Clean, beautiful, a happy place to be. Littering discouraged with beautiful posters and plenty of waste and recycling bins"
In the sea,On sat we were on the beach. It was raining but we did not care.we had a great time in the water and on the sand .seeing the  big boats out there was great
Lovely beach ,Lovely family friendly beach and clean not been here for 20 years so enjoyed it also walked to boscombe across the sea front nice easy walk
Dirty place,"The beach itself is nice, however, city council should make effort to install more waste bins. The amount of rubbish is left by people is disgusting. But if there is no place to put it .. also higher fines must be introduced for leaving waste on the beach."
Very nice beach,Very nice and clean plenty bins. Showers and WC everywhere. Lots of parking and some are free. Very nice beach.
Late night walks ,"What is not to like about a late night walk along the beautiful beach at Bournemouth.    It is clean, safe and above all happy.We always walk miles when here but if I had any moan it is that not enough is open in this covid world for if you fancy a drink!!!"
Great day trip!,We all needed this! It wasn’t a particularly hot day so it wasn’t packed. Beach clean. Sea had some good waves which teens enjoyed. It stayed shallow for a good way where we were too.
Holibobs,First time visit and really enjoyed it. You would think your in a different country. Walked along the seafront in red hot weather.
stunning,"extremely clean and well-maintained beach, it was lovely having a late night walk. the sand was very clean and limited rubbish."
Staycation,Excellent clean beach. Lovely sand. Great for body boarding. Families and students having bbqs in the evening.  It has a great vibe.
Great time ,Went for a long weekend away with my partner. We picked the perfect time as it wasn’t overrun with people - so very spacious. Toilets accessible which was perfect. Great atmosphere. Would definitely visit again
Beautiful,"With the weather in our favour it was amazing, as good as any Spanish beach. A whole team of life guards we felt really safe"
Weekend Break ,"Thoroughly enjoyed the visit having made a last minute decision to make a weekend trip. Having spent many hours here from time to time, my partner and I really enjoy coming here, the beach is really great with its sandy beach and there is always so much to do, like a walk in the gardens opposite the pier and with good restaurants along the beach front and in the town centre. Always a pleasure to return again and again."
Short break ,Very nice clean beach very busy but plenty of space no lifeguards were on duty on the day we were there so you have to be careful if the sea is rough
Bournemouth dogs toilet,Bournemouth beach is a dogs toilet. How this beach has a blue flag is beyond me. Dogs in the water everywhere urinating in the dunes where children love to play. Constantly patrolled by beach staff during the day who sit in the vans and drive up and down doing nothing!  BAN dogs from April to the end of September like most responsible resorts.
Beautiful ,Really well kept and spotless beach. It was a busy Sunday lunchtime with everyone enjoying a paddle and a swim on a typical overcast ‘summers day’ car parking wasn’t cheap but I’m sure it costs a fortune to keep a beach looking great! Hats off to the council for keeping the beach looking stunning.
Beach Day Out ,"My family adore this beach, having visited more than a few times this summer. It’s a great atmosphere, local toilets, refreshments and fresh water to rinse off. Be advised during summer to arrive early to avoid disappointment as car parks fill up quickly. In my experience, arriving later than 10:30 didn’t leave much room for parking. Bring a picnic and enjoy a whole day here."
Amazing service from life guard  ,I travel to Bournemouth on regular business trips and always love to sit watch the sea and enjoy the beach. On this particular day on Wednesday the 19 i was there to witness from afar a very kind life guard who was helping a disabled couple. The disabled lady who clearly had no use of her legs as she was sat down and bum shuffling in the water and from the water. Whilst I presume her husband was sat with her wheel chair.The life guard  continually whent between the couple helping with drinks to and from checking on the lady and letting the husband know when she needed something.The empathy this young gentleman showed amazing to see. For this lady being disabled I will feel is obviously debilitating and restricting so being facilitated to be able ro enjoy a beach was amazing to see.If that was my son and employee I would be extremely proud of his conduct. He never seemed put out or flustered. I witnessed great conduct from life guards and the security in keeping the beach maned.Well done Bournemouth Well done Bournemouth life guards.
Clean beach ideal for families,Relatively quiet afternoon near Boscombe. Sand was clean and the sea warm. Ideal for families including young children. Lifeguards are on duty in the clearly marked swimming areas.
Rainy lunch visit,Beautiful beach and lovely to walk either way towards Sandbanks or towards Hengistbury head. Good Pier and restaurants nearby and the Gardens worth a visit.
Filthy Beaches,The state of Bournemouth beach whilst COVID-19 virus is rife was a disgrace.  Litter everywhere glass bottles on beach and used nappies. They had beach staff walking up and down the promenade but they did not say anything to anyone. Luckily we had a beach hut and did not need to sit with the hordes.  The toilets are filthy and definitely are a breeding ground for this virus to spread.  Bournemouth council need cleaners every hour to clean the toilets and people who are employed to pick litter up to do it all the time.
The best beach I've visited in the UK ,"Been here twice. Beautiful views of the sea, clean. Great place to visit with family. Bournemouth is really the best beach I've seen in the UK so far. Loved our time here."
Go and lie on your nearest landfill site for an equivalent experience,"I have never been to such a shockingly dirty beach. The beach is 50% sand and 50% BBQ Charcoal. By mid afternoon it’s littered with dirty nappies, used tampons, and a ton of household waste, actually reading on the news later, it’s 30 tons of household waste on an average day. Disgusting beach."
Wonderful beach ,We visited Bournemouth beach during a four day stay in Southampton where we intended to visit different places daily. However we loved Bournemouth so much we returned a second day and would trip there directly again soon. The beach is huge and has some lovely sandy beaches with soft current which is not steep into the water near the pier. We have a 3 and 6 year old and fear them being in the water alone; however here that was far less the case. They were able to play happily for hours with us confident we could get to them before they got too deep. There is also a great tasting new forest ice cream stand and a wonderful tropical looking park adjacent to the beach.
Enjoyable beach,We had a fantastic time at the beach. It was hot day and the water was cool.The beach was not over packed with people. It was pleasant to be there and have a relaxing time.The only discomfort was the presence of hungry cigales that went very wild as they approached us.They aggressively surrounded us when they smelled the snack of my son.
Just lovely,Lovely. So so clean considering the amount of people that were there. Really nice all the way from Boscome to sandbanks
sunnycove2020,"Clean and plenty of bins for rubbish. Also, plenty of reminders to be Covid aware and encouraging people to keep to the left."
Clean beach,"This is a lovely clean beach, with clean water, a lifeguard station and plenty of places for eating and drinking, very family friendly in my opinion"
Visit to the sea side,Day visit to the beach. Not the cleanest. Hate people leaving cigarette stumps. Just take your rubbish with you. Lovely views up & down. Lots of new attractions from last time we where here. New crazy golf & Resturant. Nice to see a big wheel. Cruise ships waiting to start work again in the sea. Lovely day out for all ages. Great to walk through the park to Bournemouth town center. The Balloon has gone. This was a shock. Pier was lovely to walk along.
Extremely disappointed,Went for a swim at Boscombe on the 13th August 2020 only to be told by the Lifeguards  that there was raw sewerage in the water.
amazing beach,Beautiful beach.i was still pleased with how clean it was all these years later on than when i have been down before.only bad point some peoples social distance skills need to be looked at.
Overcrowded and litter strewn,"The beach is seriously overcrowded considering we are supposed to be social distancing at the moment and this despite signs telling people it’s too busy and to go home. It is also covered in litter, I guess there are bins around, maybe some people should learn how to use them or take their rubbish home? And when did playing personal music over a speaker so that you can annoy people nearby become the norm? Serious lack of respect for the keep left signs, just a free for all. Seems like some people have completely lost the plot since we’ve been allowed out again. Personally I’d stay at home."
Family holiday. ,Fantastic family holiday to christchurch and regular user of Southbourne beachThe beach as always since we started coming in the 90s was implacable miles of golden beaches clean and tidy. It was however very dissapointing that deckchairs and other facilities like the land train and cliff lifts are out of action due to Covid19. Especially when you go to Swanage and these services are all available and covid safe. There are plenty of ferry's and trips which have all restarted with covid safe measure it feels liek a cop out thsi year and I'm ashamed of Barnsley christchurch and Poole Council for not doign more to ensure people have at least some sort of holiday during these difficult times instead you reduce accessibility for users and expect everyone to pack onto the zig zags instead of having the various council staff who are paid to undertake risk assessments and get things safe.
Fantastic sandy beach,"Come early to park, loads of room even when heaving - you just have to walk 100 yards away from the toilets."
Butt Linz,"The most fascinating place to watch the common homosapien beat their chests in a large crowd much like seals on a small island. Its like a nightclub, only there's sea. 241 on Carling"
Beautiful Beach but too busy,"With me being fairly local to Bournemouth, I always love visiting the beachfront as its one of the few sandy beaches in the area and has the promenade you can walk along. Unfortunately in summer when it's hot, it is awfully packed and if you're not a people person, you do not want to go down there and be squashed in between all those sweaty bodies!!"
amazing,Sea was clean and felt really warm for england.if you moved well away from the pier it was easy to keep distance.The only downside was people smoking on the beech.
Bad vibes,"Bournemouth is a beautiful place but it makes me feel sick at how capitalist it is, and the lack of care for it’s citizens. It is too obvious how much the council care about money. They have done up beach huts that are not even in use for the whole year. Disabled and homeless people are around everywhere and there is no community initiative. They could turn one open space into a community allotment area, which instead they renovate into expensive parking or “luxury” apartments that are not affordable. They could turn one of the many many hotels into a community support service where rough sleepers can go. This all sickens me and I feel lost about what to do about it. Bournemouth is tainted by this and it is getting worse. They have billboards that emit heat into the atmosphere when the air is getting warmer and climate change is dramatic and obvious. I feel very sad about this."
Lovely beach,Splendid.  Mostly clean despite the crowd at these times.  Lovely beach and ice creams.  Would love to visit anytime
our experience of bournemouth beach,this was one of the best beaches we have been to in this country it was spotlessly clean no pebbles or rocks plenty of toilets litter bins and places to get something to eat the only thing we didnt enjoy was there were too many people playing loud music which we thought very anti social and spoilt it for us
Beautiful beach!,Beautiful beach! Well worth a visit the beach has loads of amenities close and has steps and ramp access! Would recommend a visit when your local!
Super,"Beautiful beach, but  Too busy summer time. Still can enjoy sand and warm water. Will come back, definitely."
Birthday treat ,Beach was really busy but was lovely people were social distanced and the sea must have been warm as there was loads of people swimming people were on the beach late evening having bbqs and still swimming
Costa Del Sol of England,"Lovely stretch of sandy beach, wonderful facilities provided bu the council, lots of shops, food stalls everywhere. The only thing is that food from the stalls were pricey in comparison. Parking is available for about £10 whole day."
Great beach,Spent a lovely hot day on this beach . We bought a chair and 2 parasol from a shop opposite the beach. People observed social  distancing on the beach.  We  rented an apartment nearby so we left our car at the apartment otherwise we would have struggled to find a parking space.  The walk up from the beach to the road is quite arduous  though. There are toilets opposite the beach.
Beach,Miles and miles of clean sandy beaches what is not to like. The part of the beach we went on allowed dogs but this didnt spoil my enjoyment of it as they were for the most part very well behaved
Lovely ,Nicest beach ive been to in the uk. Life guards and staff all around the beach front pier was free and sand clean. All very pleasant and social distancing
Beautiful sunny windy day safely enjoying the coast!,This was our first visit to the coast post Covid-19 and we happily wandered a good 20 minutes in both directions from the pier watching the world go by. The sand is busier nearest the pier but the further you walked away the less people were on the beach (it is Tuesday though) and seeing the car parking prices above the cliffs it is definitely cheaper trying to use on road parking than the central multi-storey we paid nearly £20 for six hours in! Everything looked clean and people were enjoying heading into the sea or building sandcastles; idyllic. It is probably at least 10 years since we last visited Bournemouth pier and beach but won’t leave it so long next time.
Beautiful beach ,Visit the pier then go either left or right instead of staying at the main part of the beach. It’s less packed. You can have bbqs after 6pm and it’s all very family friendly.
Very clean beach ,First visit to Bournemouth ... was a bit wary of coming here seeing all the negative media attention about packed beaches and rubbish ... we came on a sunny weekend ... was very impressed with the cleanliness of the sandy beach and water ... you can even see the ships anchored out there ... I even let my little one venture out to sea ... all families were spaced out so needn’t have worried soo much ... plenty of lifeguards around ... lots of water fountains to wash the sand off ... seen plenty toilets around too ... the pier was a very nice walk ... very enjoyable visit.
Great,"Sandy beach, very clean if you arrive early in the morning, people were distancing and respecting each other's safe space; ice cream vendors at both ends of the beach. The water was very clean and shallow, easy to have a relaxing swim or for kids to play safely. The Oceanarium is minutes away, lots of take away places very near by, the beach gets a bit messy towards sunset as some uncivilised people left their rubbish on the beach. It would be nice if the council would have some beach chairs to rent for the day to increase the comfort of the visitors."
Lovely beach,"Lovely place, the beach is very large and so everyone could apply the 2m away distance.There is two piers on this beach, the east and west. The east pier does cost to go on, but not at night. You can see people fishing on the pier late at night. A nice amount of shops around.By the west pier it has less to do, but the harvester on the sea front is nice for the view it gives."
Beautiful ,"Lovely beach. Lots of people having bbq's and gatherings after 7pm on 1st August. Many young people either drunk or high, partying and openingly urinating by the beach huts. Sure it's a lovely place during the day"
Nice beach but council  make it difficult.,Tried to visit the beach on a warm  mid week day in mid July.(Not an exceptionally hot day and before the main holiday season started on 31st July).  The beach car park was closed  because we were told to control crowds. There was masses of room away from the pier. Youngsters are easily able to climb down  form the Overcliff drive and up again but for more elderly  people who wanted to take chairs to sit on  or were  unable to walk long distances or climbs steep hills it make it impossible.  Businesses told us that the council's attitude was putting off visitors and affecting their businesses.
Good but busy,Very busy but nice. Good waves and plenty of places to eat. Food places are over priced as is the parking.
7 miles of sandy beach,"Well maintained and cleaned - people respected social distancing when we were there. Some were seen having a take away from Harry Ramsden ( fish and Chips) which opened from 11.30am. BBQ on the beach is allowed after 18.00hrs. Patrol of Police cars, helpers and paramedics were visible. Good stretch from Boscombe Pier to Bournemouth - continuous sandy beach- 2.5 ?Kms"
Not clean,The beach looked nice but was not cleaned.The water was very dirty and I needed to walk 2miles to find a good place.A good thing is you can run in the morning without someone to stopped you.After 10 am became very very crowded.
a bit of a holiday-feeling during corona,"We simply loved it! As we couldn't travel anywhere - not even to our home countries - we stayed in Britain and decided to leave London for a mini-vacation. I wonder why we didn't do that earlier! We were so lucky as we had amazing weather, so we could enjoy the atmosphere at Bournemouth beach fully. It was also the first time I could go in the water here in Britain. Brighton's coast is toooo freezing for us but Bournemouth made it possible to jump in - at least quickly ;-)"
Lovely beach ,Really enjoyed visiting this beach. Nice and sandy lots of stuff to do near by and great views. Find most beaches in the UK are too rocky but not this one!
Lovely but crowded,It is a massive sandy beach. There is lots of shops and other amenities around also life guards on duty. Toilets are free and clean. As much as beach is great I want over keen on surroundings . I prefer more character local places but this is an individual preference . As it is a popular place it can get crowded although due to the size of the beach it was quite easy to find a safe place
Lovely beach,"Lovely walk from Bournemouth Pier to Sandbanks, plenty of refreshment stops open and all toilets open as well and they were being monitored and cleaned regularly by the council, great character met on route, the gentleman who was sweeping the prom, so friendly and chatty. Never seen so many people walking their dogs, a shame not all dog owners kept to the rules about what beaches they should be on."
Beautiful beach,"Lovely, usually clean beach. Soft sand on beach, lots of attractions and facilities nearby. Public toilets available right next to the beach as well as places to eat and drink or just to grab an ice cream. Has a lovely pier you can walk along to admire the views out to Swanage etc."
Great beach - but COVID has taken the sparkle,"My wife and I usually spend our yearly summer vacation in the Algarve but due to the issues surrounding COVID this year we thought we would stay in the UK and take several short breaks. We spent four days in Bournemouth and were amazed at the wonderful beach and how clean the water was. It was just like being in the Algarve or any other Southern European holiday resort. The town has been hit hard with shops and restaurants closing down which took the sparkle away slightly, restricted choice for dining in the evenings and things to do when it was wet for the day. We hope that with time other places open and bring that sparkle back. That said the central garden area is a lovely place to visit and relax. We will definitely go back again when the weather is good."
"Bournemouth, great to chill out. ","The first time that I have been in Bournemouth was 15 years ago! Looong time. Back now, I could see the difference and the city still charming, on my point of view Bornemouth still in 70s, the architeture, the place looks like a little bit vintage.The pier during early morning is great for a walking or just to feel the fresh air from the sea. Lot’s of seagulls, beautiful ones. After 11am you can have a nice fish and chips near by the beach, not expensive one, for less than 10 pounds you can have it, plus a drink. The ice cream, well... enJOY it!"
100% amazing place,"Beautifull place,  I will back definitely, perfect place for families. Sandy beach, lot of atractions, decommended !"
lovely stress-free visit,"Had my annual summer visit to Bournemouth beach.  weather was lovely on the day. I have kids so I prefer to visit Alum Chine beach. It is very family friendly, theres a big playground there, right by the tropical gardens. fish and chips from Harry Ramsden's is a must.I am surprised that the local council allows us to park for free! :) there is tonnes of free parking on West overcliff drive. such a long road. Parking is free 24/7. so no point in paying parking charges anywhere else. get there nice and early :)"
Beautiful ,Initially apprehensive about visiting Bournemouth but it was actually lovely.Not the mad crowds that we saw a few weeks back.This is one of the nicest beaches that we've been to.Can't wait to return.
Great place,One of the best beaches and safe lots of security and had a fantastic time clean and safe . Plenty to do
Clean Beach,A good litter-free beach. There are plenty of restaurants and takeaway places. There is also a big wheel and aquarium.
Lovely sandy beach ,Visited on a Monday and those the weather was nice it wasn’t crowded and we could easily socially distance and have a large space to set up our things.The sand is lovely but was a shame to see glass bottles broken and rubbish around even those there are lots of bins/recycling a few steps away.The water was clear and lots of boats and things going on to keep a toddler amused.
Lovely walk,"Beautiful beach. Pleasant walk. Plenty of ice cream shops, snacks and drinks avaiable. Highly recommended :)"
Midweek getaway,Fantastic weather really clean and social distance observed. Good selection of eateries  took a ride on big wheel
Beautiful sand & sea ,Crystal clear sea and lovely soft sand Gets very busy so walk further up toward Boscombe for a quieter area
Avoid,I’ve never been so ashamed to be British as was when I came here and saw for myself the carnage and rubbish. Decided to have a night away with a quiet stroll on beach of an evening. The beach is filthy. Filled with people at 9pm. No social distancing. Rubbish everywhere. People feeding seagulls. Dodging speeding bikes. Large groups of people. Skateboarding students everywhere. No one knows their left to to their right. KEEP LEFT sign clearly not big enough nor the signs every 2metres telling them to keep left. Strong smell of weed everywhere. Never again.
Beautiful Bournemouth ,"Bournemouth is a beautiful sandy beach spoilt only be one thing; people! Especially the people who despite there being a number of bins for both recycling and rubbish choose instead to throw or leave their rubbish on the beach. Despicable really. A lovely walk along the beach is tainted by seeing bits of rubbish, beer caps, plastic waste and cigarette butts. Please take your trash with you - it’s really as simple as that and hopefully we will be able to enjoy the grace of the beach for longer. It gets extremely busy at the moment and social distancing during the day or at peak times is not always possible. We tend to visit in the late afternoon when it’s not so busy but expect to see lots of groups 8+ in some cases. People play their own music and BBQ’s also appear to be permissive as there were lots of those taking place too.The local pubs and attractions have started to reopen and come back to life so there is really lots to do. The popular part of the beach is near the pier which is only a 20 minute straight walk from the train station."
Feels like going abroad,"Stretching for miles in both directions, to Christchurch and Poole, if you come here on a warm summer day you can have a happy trip walking alongside the beach or riding a bike, but bikes aren't allowed between July and August. Go on the beach to go for a swim, have some food with family, play volleyball or just sunbathe or make a sand castle. You can go along Bournemouth pier and even go up a large tower at the end and go on a zip wire back down to the beach. During the summer months, it feels like going abroad, except without the hassle of flights, hotels and passports. There are plenty of restaurants, fish and chips places and toilets if necessary dotted along the beach if you need anything. On a hot day you'll see the place is packed and see people of all backgrounds walking along enjoying the sunshine. You'll also see small beach huts lined up side by side in the hundreds which you can buy if you'd like. The sea also changes, on some days you'll see large cruise ships, or even an oil rig, maybe even para-surfers. If you look at the cliff in the far distance leading to Christchurch, you will see what looks like a polar bear on the side of the cliff. Go out for a nice walk and enjoy the sun, one of the best beaches to visit in England."
Lovely beach,"Limited toilets but not a problem as you can urinate, defecate and change tampons behind peoples beach huts, no need to worry about cleaning it up because the owner will do it when they finally get to enjoy the beach hut they pay for out of their hard earned money!No worries about having to pick up after yourselves at all because the locals here love their coastline and will volunteer their time to pick up everything for you, condoms, dirty nappies, used sanitary products, dirty underwear, they have strong stomachs so leave them all with reckless abandon for others to pick up for you, such a great service! Really great that you can BBQ and also camp on the beach too, and you can leave your tent and everything and the litter fairy will come clean it up, you can also play a great game called wheres the boiling hot sand? Kind of like mine craft with bbqs, basically you cover your boiling hot used bbq with sand and then some one who comes there after you've gone, completely unaware that you buried it there will have 3rd degree burns on their feet, it's great fun!You feel perfectly safe on the beach even if you have no clue about beach safety, if you accidentally swim into a rip current or forget to pack oars for your inflatable, use it anyways and get swept out, the locals are used to risking their lives on a weekly basis to save you.Basically, if you love to leave dirty items, litter everywhere, go to toilet outdoors, cause injury to other beach goers, risk the lives of others and kill sealife, then this is the beach for you!"
Nice beach,Really busy and quite messy. Nonetheless the beach was an enjoyable experience but due to how crowded it was you couldn’t do much. I recommend visiting a smaller beach.
Disgusting Litter Everywhere!,I’ve never seen so much litter in my life. Its disgusting! I’m actually speechless. Can’t wait to go abroad again.
One of my favourite beaches in the UK,"Bournemouth beach is a lovely, golden sand beach with a lovely sea. It is great place to walk along, whether you walk along the sand or the path. Most of the time it is very clean. It does get very busy on hot summery days, but as you go further along towards Boscombe it tends to get quieter.There are plenty of food and drink places around the area, on and off the beach. Also there are souvenir shops and rental places to hire bikes, surf bords, paddleboards and boogie boards. The sea gets great waves for surfing and can also be really calm which makes it a great place to swim and paddle board. There are plenty of parking areas in and around Bournemouth to park but it also has great train links. You can walk, bus or Uber from the train station to the beach."
Beautiful ,Bournemouth beach is beautiful.The beaches are pretty clean considering the amount of visitors each year (and the fines for dropping litter and cigarettes- which the enforcers are hot on) Probably would still wear shoes. There not much wave break- don’t bother bringing a surf board.It’s great for walking along the sand and soaking up the sun- however it does get EXTREMELY busy in the summer. I’ve had some great days and evenings on Bournemouth beach.
Clean and tidy during the day,Clean and tidy during the day. The sand on the beach is great if only bournemouth borough council could spend some money heating the water
View,"The beach is lovely, nice sand, very long, good walk along the front, nice water, good for all the family, from Bournemouth town,just walk through the park and you come to the beach, lovely place."
Nice visit,"I had a very nice visit here. Its really long and you can just take a walk if you feel like it, go swimming, sunbathe in the sand or play volleyball!"
Lovely sandy beach,"We walked down to the beach through Lower Gardens. The area is well laid out, and there is an underpass from the Lower Gardens to the beach, thus avoiding traffic. The beach is sandy by the pier, and plenty of room for everyone at this time of year. It wasn't warm enough to swim or sunbath, but it was nice to be on the beach in March."
Visit to the Beach,Breathtaking Views and amazing vibe on the beach. Best experience ever. Loved it. Bournemouth Pier is my best and love the view from there
One of the best beaches in the country,"This is a great beach with fine sand and the water is safe to swim in. It is good for the whole family, there are plenty of things to do and the shops are close by."
Love Bournemouth Beach!,"I'm a little biased as I live in Bournemouth, but the beach at Bournemouth is amazing! More needs to be done to encourage people to take their litter home at the end of the day, however the beach team make sure its always gorgeous again by the morning. Such a gorgeous place to spend the day! :-)"
Bournemouth,"Bournemouth Beach is gorgeous for a walk. However, the toilets are a huge disappointment. Absolute stinker."
Sun sand sea shirt shorts sword sandals..,Bournemouth 7. miles of beach Sandbanks to Hengistbury Head overlooks The Needles Isle of Wight to Old Harry Rocks Swanage hundreds of hotels thousands of rooms prices can change 3. times a day 7. times a week The town has a varity of shops restaurants walk through The Winter Gardens Summer Seasonal resort..
Lovely beach,"Good beach. Sandy and clean. Beautiful views all  around. Lots of people in sea, surfing, in march. Saw they had tractors clearing the prom walkway of sand that had covered it overnight.  The amount of sand seems to have increased, as it's now very deep & level with prom,  covering steps"
Wonderful visit,I came for a relaxing break & that is exactly what I got. Great location. Hotel was looking a little tired but they've worked hard recently on the interior to change this. The staff here are without doubt the hotels greatest asset. Will be staying again.
Great beach in winter,Lovely beach. October half term. Not very warm so beach quite empty. Was just after a storm so sand had blown up all over the prom. Was interesting to see. Prom goes on and on. We hired a couple of uber bikes and cycled from end to end.
Best beach on the south coast,"Excellent area for family beach fun. Lots to do if more entertainment needed to keep the brats happy, from amusements to a excellent oceanarium."
Beautiful beach,Love this beach. Parking is close to the beach and not too pricey. Always somewhere lovely to eat. Nice cocktail bar up the hill a little.
Beautiful beach,"It was the first time to Bournemouth beach. It was a beautiful day and the beach is a beautiful sight. They are very lucky to have such wonderful views. The pier was a lovely pier and nice spot to watch the surfers waiting for the waves. A nice restaurant on the end of the pier,  we had a nice walk back to our hotel. Lots of benches to sit on and rest and admire the scenery."
Beautiful long sandy beach,Beautiful long sandy beach at this well-known seaside resort. Plenty of restaurants and attractions nearby.
I love this place,Wow what a place especially the views I was not expecting England beaches to be this good I can not wait for the summer
Who does not love the seaside,"Whatever the weather, most of us do like the seaside; lots to see and do. Two piers too with attractions"
Delightful Beach,"The first thing I noticed was it was extremely clean. A sandy beach which would be ideal for children, and a long prom for a leisurely troll"
Love this Beach!,"Very clean, long and sandy beach! I love this place and visit whenever I can whether on my own or with my family. I would definitely recommend a visit to this beach!!"
Long sandy beach,"Although we could not go on each due to weather. It was a long clean beach. Lots of lovely sand. We walked along the path that runs along side the beach .At one end by town there is a big wheel to ride,. Also a pier to goon to."
Very good,"A lovely south coast beach, one of the best. Would recommend to anyone who wishes to visit. Although a big cold the beach leads to a lovely garden followed big many shops. One of my fave places!"
"Have visited 1000's of times, never disappointed","The beach, the promenade, the gardens, the town..... my favourite place. Loads to see and do for all ages."
Beautiful beach,Sand being pushed back after weeks of storms.  Walkway nicely punctuated with searing areas and exercise equipment.  Lovely and clean.
Windy walk,"Beautiful beach, great place to stretch the legs. Lots of friendly people enjoying the beach and sea, body boarding and surfing the waves as it was fairly choppy today."
The beach,"To me this is one of the best beaches in England. When you first see it from the top of the hill it makes you smile .Take the grandchildren there and they love it. This beach is cleaned every morning. Does allow dogs on certain parts of it.But still plenty of other areas of you do not have one. Can hire beach huts, Deck chairs etc.Highly recommended."
Weekend,"Really well looked after beach. Sandy and long, close to amenities.Popular for air shows and Firework displays."
Can't beat Bournemouth beach,If you're looking for golden sands then Bournemouth beach really is the place to go.Having lived here the locals go further away from Bournemouth pier towards the Sandbanks end as its much quieter.Always clean but day trippers do leave rubbish sadly 😔
The Power of the Sea.,"I cannot express in words how the power of the sea effects me. There is an energy that I cannot describe. The beach is always clean,the water is always clean.This is a magical, calming heart warming place."
Feb 2020,"Beautiful beach. Sandy and spacious. Plenty of places to eat and drink. We were there on a lovely sunny day on the 1st of Feb, I can imagine it is perfect in the summer."
Absolutely love Bournemouth,Get to Bournemouth on a very hot day and get yourself on that beach you would think your aboard we offen go there but on a very hot day or bank holiday the beach is always packed so your best bet is to drive up a bit well it's less busy
Nice day out,Really nice beach things to do including arcades a pier and a few shops. Theres an oceanarium just 2 minutes from the main beach centre. That gives something to do
Stunning Views ,"Very clean, stunning g views a bit like the Gold Coast. Good for walking went in Feb and it was very sunny and warm"
Great walk,Its a very pleasant walk along a couple of miles of well kept promenade and beach with glorious sea views
Lovel Stroll,"Love this beach. Been coming since childhood. It’s sandy, clean. There was a wedding reception this weekend and what a magical place for it. The cafes and shops do great coffees and ice creams."
So good I don;t really don't want to share it,Luckily the beach its 7 miles long so I can afford to share it with a few more visitors.  The sand is beautiful and the sea is clean and clear.  I don't think I have even seen seaweed on it. The council maintain the promenade  and toilets so it is well worth a visit all year round.  There are ample restaurants and kiosks on the level promenade that runs the whole length of the beach. Great for walking or sunbathing or just people watching.
A couple of sunny February days walking along beach.,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and over a day and a half we walked along the beach between Durley Chine and beyond the pier at Bournemouth, on several occasions. The beach looks lovely and sandy and rubbish free.This time of year it is lacking in swimmers and sunbathers but I suspect it will be crowded as it is so nice."
Nice day out on the sand ,"In my opinion the Bournemouth beach area was quite pleasing, the beach is a bit busy but the area is quite pleasant, there are many dog walkers as well as many families enjoying the sunshine.And the beach is great for a casual walk too. Overall great place to go with your families."
fun for the dogs,the beach had a few dog walkers on the beach and our dogs had a good run round verey clean in the wet  winter
Must go place....,"Been their few times, Parking and road traffic can be bit tricky in a busy hot summer days.very long clean sandy beach. must take plenty of sun cream..... also bring your shades.."
Disabled Parking Crisis,Visitors should avoid disabled parking in Bournemouth Council car parks as you will get a parking ticket even when displaying a blue badge and even if you are tax exempt.
Weekend visit,"Our first visit to Bournemouth and have to say, was very pleased.The beach was very busy [yes, it's January!], with plenty of dog walkers and families enjoying the winter sunshine."
Every 6 weeks!,Always a pleasure to walk a mile or two along this lovely sandy beach! With my two miniature schnauzers this time of year!
Uni visit ,Beautiful beach very clean dog friendly  went there as my daughter was at her uni interview which was very close by
Great long beach and really clean,Long coast and beach here. Well worth a long stroll. Keep very clean too. Lovely pier as well. Sea 8s a bit choppy though.
1 nights stay,Stayed at the Holiday Inn close to the beach within walking distance. Bournemouth has a lovely sandy beach would be great for children. But not in January too cold. Even though the surfers were still in the water. The pier is very nice.
Fabulously clean and beautiful,"I love Bournemouth beach, it’s wonderful, I just don’t get to visit enough as I am too far away! Sunday stroll to get our steps up at the weekend, really lovely. Will be back soon!"
Great location,"Lovely sandy beach even on January visit.  Great fun watching Surfers either side of the Pier.  Whole area very inviting, excellent for families especially."
Saturday walk,Wind was blowing skies dark time for a fresh walk along one of the best beaches in England Bournemouth it’s got places to stop for a cuppa where you can watch the sea waves roll in despite the weather it’s always a great place for a stroll
Beautiful walk along bournemouth beach to poole,Wonderful walk approx 5 miles along tbournemouth beach to poole.  Lovely walk on waters edge with families and lovely friendly dogs.
Sandy beach ,Although we visited in the winter this beach and its beautiful scenery make a great walk from one side of Bournemouth to the other
You can see why it's so popular!,"A long stretch of golden sand, flanked by cliffs of varying heights with paths on top to enjoy even better views. Good prom walk too, cafes, loos as well. Doggy-friendly too at this time of year. Not sure I'd really fancy being in this area in high summer though. The roads from the A338 onwards seem busy enough in January (and in October when we were here last)"
New years eve celebrations / fire works,New years eve we had a great meal at Miller and carter's we then took our own fire works on to Bournemouth beach. Their must have been 200 people or more enjoying fire works and drinks. No crime felt safe . The weather was on are side this year great way to see new years day in. Thank you to all who shared our evening with us.
Pier visit,"Forgot to star it so have done it, have already done a proper review, as I said it's great to have two piers one in Bournemouth and the other at Boscombe. The views from both piers are lovely over the purbecks hills and also towards the Isle of Wight"
Nice,"Walked along the promenade, the beach looked clean and inviting, the quality of the sand looked good, also at this time of the year it is dog friendly which is great, well worth coming to."
Fantastic,"Well worth a visit. Beautiful views, Most days you can see the Isl of  White. Beautiful golden sand for miles"
A beatiful flat & sandy beach with a chargable Pier.,"This is a stunning completely flat & sandy beach that is great for all seasons, especially in the summer months when it is extremely popular when the sand becomes golden & silky, plus the sea is calm & glistening once the sun shines on the clear blue waters.There is plenty to do as well as swimming, sun bathing & building sand castles, plenty of parking in the large car-park, plus along the seafront itself, lots of eateries including the Famous Harry Ramsden fish & chip restaurant & take away, the Pier is great to take a stroll along, there is also the beautiful park & gardens plus Bournemouth's town centre which is full of shops all within walking distance."
Castles,This is the perfect place to build a castle with a bucket and spade. I tried a similar beach with my bucket and spade but sadly it was made of small rocks and it just didn't stand.  You probably can't live in a sand castle but with the power of Disney who knows? There is water nearby and toilets
Bournemouth beach,Excellent sandy beach with two pies to choose from. There is a large wheel near to the western pier and the Oceanarium is nearby
Lovely pier beach,"We travelled from London and reached the pier at 1pm and went to a sea-facing place for lunch which was burgers and fries. We then went around the pier, watched sea gulls and enjoyed an ice cream and coffee too. We then walked up to the Russel-Cotes house when we enjoyed the time in the lawns and walked back to the pier area where there were water fountains for children to enjoy."
Doggy day out,"Took the dog for a run on the beech, he had a whale of a time, we’ve had some wonderful days on the beech, I think it’s probably my favourite seaside resort, beautiful"
Massive beach front,Went there today to use a Christmas present. Lovely long beach with plenty of drink and food places along the way. Great morning out.
The Beach,What a wonderful strength  of golden sand so soft on the feet. Such a great place to traverse so near to the ebbing sea and prevailing wind on a summers day
Superb Beach,I fully understand how people will think Bournemouth Beach in December Superb! Well the truth is we love this coastline and living 35+ miles in land and approx 1 hour from the nearest beach coming here for the Christmas Market and taking in the Beach with it was certainly required by us. The view of the Beach in all its glory is seen from the top of West Cliff. We walked down from here and marvelled at the shear length of the Beach which extends all the way along to Boscombe. The Pier was in use and we saw some very brave individuals using the zip wire from the Pier Tower to the Beach area. The sea was fairly rough as there was a strong and cold wind. No real need to walk on the sand at this time of year but you can make use of the pathway and road which is easy to use. Obviously the summer season shows this stretch of beach in its full glory but we do feel that December walks with the views across to the Isle Of Wight are simply superb.
Beach Walk-December,"Visiting Bournemouth, staying in Boscombe. Obvious option into town is the bus. However for a real treat, if you are in this area is to walk along the beach, or adjacent Undercliff Rd. Not necessary to walk on the actual sand if you prefer not to. From Boscombe Pier to Bournemouth Pier is probably about 35-45 mins depending on how many distractions you come across. I certainly never thought that walking along a beach on December would be so rewarding! The timing was important, just as the sun was setting on a clear cold day. The waves crashing into the beach and glistening in the declining sunlight. If you have the opportunity, treat yourself to something special!"
"Perhaps the Best ""Popular"" Beach in the UK in arguably the Best South Coast Seaside Resort.","Stunning golden sand with a lovely esplanade allowing you to walk from Boscombe to Westbourne/Sandbanks, with views to the Needles and Isle of Wight to the East, and Old Harry Rocks/Isle of Purbeck to the West. Litter free with plenty of facilities and, by the pier, ready access to the Lower Gardens for a relaxing time by the stream, or mini golf for the more active. In my view, without doubt Bournemouth is the best seaside resort in the UK!"
Access for disabled blue badge,I couldn’t find easy access for blue badge parking near enough to Bmth seafront. Very poor layout compared to other towns  Bad location of information office. Start listening to the needs of people.
Nice Vibe,Good beach. A lot of things to see and do. Good food. Nice places to eat. Good parking. Good shopping.
Beach,Staying here in Bournemouth for 5 days and although it’s November the beach still looks great lovely smooth sand.
A lovely walk,Great walk in from the eastcliff using the descent to the seafront. Great fun with the exercise benches along the front.
Friendly,Lovely walk along Bournemouth beach last Sunday.A coolish day but at least it was dry. It was a lovely atmosphere people were smiley and friendly. Lovely sandy beach and lots of seafront cafes. Everywhere looked clean. Parking was really reasonable too.
Stunning,This a credit to Bournemouth as the beach is stunning and so well looked after!  Such a lovely walk and view with nice places to stop for coffee or lunch along the way.
Wonderfully as always ,Our favourite place to visit each time we are in Bournemouth. Great place to relax with kids. If only the weather was better ☔☔
Peaceful ,Even though the weather wasn't as great as it could be the beach is still peaceful and beautiful as always! Forever my favourite beach in the UK!
Just as beautiful as I remembered,"It was years since I went to Bournemouth - I remember watchng Charles and Di's wedding there, so when I heard the LIb Dem conference was being held here it was also an opportunity to revisit a few old haunts. The beach was just as gorgeous as I remembered - miles of golden sands lined with shops and restaurants of all kinds. I don't recall the Fun Fair being there or any of the bouncy castles, but times change and so does the town! The beach of course is always busy as one would expect on a sunny weekend in late September, so I would imagine it is even more packed druing school holidays. It is good for a meander at any rate or a little paddle in the sea!"
Excellent!,We have visited many times over the years and it is our favorite by far (it now takes us 3 hours to drive here). The golden sand is fabulous and goes on for miles either side of the piers. There are beach huts for hire as well as deck chairs etc. There is also a Harry Ramsdens for Fish & Chips as well as kiosks and shops dotted around. The gardens behind the pier are great and the town centre is just behind it.
5 star beach,Great walking along here on a sunny November day. Surfers in sea. Plenty of seats to sit on in the sun. Even people using the beach hutsGreat day out
Lovely sandy beach,"Great beach long sandy hardly any people , Boardwalk behind , scattering of cafes , direct in. Town center"
Really enjoyed ,We came here when it was raining windy however it didn’t stop the kids from having fun walked along the pier at the end was indoor playground adventure didn’t go into it as it was expensive Kids went into the arcade area instead The rain slowly went so they all went on the beach and went running on the beach and messed about The weather was a let down but what do u expect for british November kids still enjoyed themselves anyway
day out,"have been to Bournemouth beach lots of times and it always a lovely day out, plenty to do as you have the gardens to wander around and shops to visit."
Beautiful Beaches ,"Perfect morning stroll along the beach, catch a coffee at the Chine Cafe and enjoy the view from their roof terrace. (Dogs welcome)"
Brilliant particularly in winter best beach in the UK,Have visited the beach on many occasions and it’s the longest stretch of sandy beach outside Miami Beach. You can run or cycle for miles and miles come rain or shine. Sunrise is always a memorable occasion.
Beautiful Beach,"What a lovely expansive sandy beach, with lots of beach huts for hire, also deckchairs and sun loungers. Not swimming weather in October, but a lovely walk and opportunities to sit in the sun, enjoy an ice cream, tea or coffee and pleasing to see more than adequate toilet facilities."
Super clean,"It was so lovely to visit a beach that had sections for BBQs, dogs and people with lots of clear information. It was clean and tidy with many attractions. Would recommend, lots of sand, perfect for sandcastle building too."
Absolutely splendid,"Ok, it was my birthday, and it was very warm and sunny for October, but the walk along the beach from Sandbanks to Bournemouth was a joy. They are renovating many of the beach chalets and all the way along are chalets and huts, many costing quite a lot to rent. The sand is plentiful (the last spring tide coincided with a storm surge so quite a lot is on the prom and in the process of being removed) and even in October folks were on it sitting and playing. Lots of places to eat along the way and plenty of loos."
The cleanest beach in the UK..  simply BEAUTIFUL ,The title says it all. I went to bournemouth University and can not stop returning back to Bournemouth Beach. Easily my favourite beach in the UK.
Nice ,So nice clean beaches. Most of the time is nice and work but in time when we was sadly very strong wind and heavy rain. but for many time what we was there this was first time like that but still was so warm. I am sure we be back there soon.
November visit ,"First time here to Bournemouth beach! First impressions clean, lots of bins great place to walk the dog. Our only complaint and this is not only for the beach but for the whole of the front at Bournemouth is the lighting on streets and at the front is awful, dim and from the dark ages. Apart from that we loved it."
This is one of the best beach in the UK,We visited this place with our whole family and it was amazing. Definitely the best beach in the UK. Only downside is the parking was a bit expensive but everyone absolutely loved it.
Family day ,We went in October but it was cold. But this was Definitely one of the best beaches in the country. Clean and presentable.
Enjoy sunshine in autumn,Splendid view when walking around sands. East Cliff & 7 Miles appears in distances. Sunny yet chilly without breeze strong wind. Perfect stroll!
Very clean,"We have just returned from a coaching holiday with shearings, with the free time we had we went for a walk on this lovely beach it's clean,plenty of nice clean sand for the children to play with,the view's whether you are on the cliff top or walking on the beach it's spectacular you mustn't miss it well worth a visit plenty of parking spaces or just a short walk from the bus station."
Busy holidays,First visit on a hot bank holiday for 3 adults.Very busy as expected.Wasn't worth us paying to go on the pier.
Lovely sandy beach,"Beautiful clean beach,good walking in each direction. One way has surfing and a great cafe on the front which has an informal friendly bohemian atomsphere. Other way to Poole harbour and Sandbanks."
Family beach day,"Love Bournemouth and the beach. Had a lovely day, and our little pup loved it too. Pier has amusements for kids, and an amazing ice cream shop just outside. Pasty place just on the beach too which is yum. And only a short 10 min walk up into town"
Very clean,The beach at Bournemouth is very clean. Lots of clean promenade to walk on. Lots of families using the facility. Sat and watched the world go by for a long time. Don't just stay in one place walk a long the sands prettier away from the town entrance.
Week End Away,Weather been sunny and dry this weekend.What a pleasure to go down too the beach at Bournemouth.Very long sandy beach very clean and tidy Nice long walk along the sands although the sea was a bit cold other people were swimming.I don’t think anyone would be unhappy with this seaside plenty of cafes and restaurants.Observation wheel very popular along with the winter gardens and pier. Look forward to our next visit.
Stunning,"Beaches in Bournemouth are simply stunning! Miles and miles of golden sand, very clean.With the cliffs as a stunning backdrop andPlenty of little cafes along the way, it’s perfect for summer fun as well as winter walks."
Beautiful,"I lived in Bournemouth for a year and, despite the weather, the beach a great place to go no matter the season. During the summer, it was full of friends and families. During the colder months, people were still found on the beach for the fireworks on Friday nights or small get-togethers. The beach offers beautiful scenery and small shops and restaurants. The gardens are short walk away."
A Weekend breakaway!,"We had a brilliant 2 night stay at the The Park Central Hotel in Bournemouth - at a very reasonable cost - nothing was too much trouble from all the lovely staff we met - special mentions to Laura, Ayo,Alice & Alex ( The Manager ) - very well done ladies - we will most definitely will be back - perhaps your signature room 307 next time?Thank you to you all."
Silky67 ,Been to Bournemouth beach many times thought it was about time to review Unfortunately we are here on a very wet day but even so its a lovely beach thats well looked after & ideal for a nice walk along ( even on a wet day ) gets very busy when the sun comes out so get there early enjoy people 😊
One of the best beaches in the UK,"The beach in Bournemouth and Boscombe is glorious. Lovely white soft sand stretches out for miles so you can always find a place to set up camp if prepared to walk away from the piers and zig-zag paths down. There are toilets, deck chairs, showers and ice cream vendors dotted along the 3 mile front. A wonderful place for children to play as the sea is safe and the sand lovely."
A lovely promenade to walk along.,We enjoy walking along this promenade. It's a real pleasant walk going from Sandbanks all the way up to Bournemouth and back. There are several cafes/restaurants on the promenade that you pass to break up the journey or rest a while. There are also the lovely scenic walks up the chimes. We do this walk everytime we come to Dorset and never tire of it.
Mini break,"Great beach for exercise, fun or just a walk, various ways down to the beach, lifts, zigzag paths, slopes down to the seafront, the pier , the big wheel and the gardens, beautiful huge bay and kept clean. Beautifully lit path at night."
Gorgeous heavh,"Staying at the Queens hotel just a minutes walk from the gorgeous beach. Very clean, lots of seats, coffee stood nearby. The gorgeous sun helped!"
Just the best,"Bournemouth beach is arguably the best stretch of beach in England. You have to visit it. There are 7 miles of beach and has distinct areas like millionaires row Sandbanks, the querkiness of Poole, Boscombe and Southbourne and don't forget the metropolitan feel of Bournemouth town centre."
outstanding beach but help needed.,"This must be one of the best beaches in the world,but on a visit in August this year the main beach area had been trashed with litter from those visiting the beach and leaving all their rubbish on beach.In fairness there were not enough rubbish bins on hand which the council needs to address but that's no excuse for the thousands of people who blatantly leave things behind for someone else to sort it out.This is a real shame because it spoils it for town and costs the council thousands to clear up.If you come please enjoy yourself but clear up when you go ."
Gorgeous beach central in Bournemouth near town,"Gorgeous beach that gets very busy during summer months especially around near the pier area, lots of youngsters, but if you walk along more you will get more space and quieter. A few resturants locally near the beach, pier has amusment rooms but nothing not big. Can walk through the gardens into town easily leading to resturants, shops, parking etc. Parking by beach is very limited best get there very early! If not jump on buses as drop right outside. There is alot of B+B, hotels near by all again walking distance. Every thing you need is on your doorstep."
Typical English seaside,We’ve had a wonderful day visiting Bournemouth Beach. It’s got fantastic facilities to suit everyone. Walks were quite refreshing. Lots of things to do. It’s also has sandy beach.
Lovely ,Went yesterday to the Marathon FestivalRan the 10k the beach is just beautiful and clean Well worth a visit
The best UK beach...,"A summer should never pass without a visit to Bournemouth.  The 10+ mile beach/promenade is such a sight to behold, either cycling, running or walking."
On par with the Caribbean ,"Lovely clean super soft sandy beeches.warm ish sea & great for couples, the elderly and youngens alike."
7 miles of golden sandy beach,"The dog beaches are too few and too far apart but aside from that Bournemouth beach is the best discovery I have had this year,"
A blustery walk,A lovely walk along the promenade.For me it’s as beautiful on days like this as it is in the summer. Just quieter.
What a superb beach,"The beach was clean and well maintained. Weather wise It was clear sunny day thus lots of sun seekers..All the amenities were opened..Deck chairs ,parasols were available for hire."
pleasant beach,beach very clean and smooth no stones. was lovely to see the surfers having fun on the waves and seeing the beach life guards still there
One of the most beautiful beaches of the UK,"Even when the weather isn’t that good, Bournemouth Beach still is a wonderful place (luckily it stayed dry!). I’d say this is one of the most beautiful sandy beaches in the UK!"
Great facilities! ,"Great fish and chip shops, cafes, restaurants. The beach was clean tidy and joyful! We spend the day swimming, glass of wine at the Aperol bar and fish and chips from Westbeach takeaway."
Soft sand,The jewel in the crown of Bournmouth is this expanse of golden beach. To be buried up to your neck is an experience you remember for life.Its cleaned daily and in season no animals are allowed
The best beach in the UK ,"So lucky to live here, never get bored of the view! Bournemouth Council do an amazing job keeping it clean and tidy."
What a Slice of Paradise,I paid a visit to Bournemouth Beach during my recent holiday. The sands are a beautiful golden colour.The beach is stunningly beautiful with clear blue waters. What a piece of paradise on the South Coast. I enjoyed taking the sea air in as i walked along the beach and also very much enjoyed watching huge waves coming in and crashing onto the shoreline. The beach is very clean.
Sand galore,Miles and miles of sandy beaches. Plenty of facility's dotted about. Deck chairs and sun beds available.
The beach,"Nice wide beach, sadly no shops, no entertainment, hardly anything to do or eat.However it’s a beautiful seaside and would recommend a visit."
♡,The beach was beautiful and seemed to go on forever... The arcades were a great touch and on the first night we won so many prizes from the 2p machine! We'll definitely be back soon.
Making the most of summer in Bournemouth ,"A Sunny day - where is the best place to go? - Bournemouth. Certainly not disappointed. The beach is always well maintained, lovely soft sand and the sea is always inviting. Lots of space to set up your own beach equipment but there is plenty to hire too. Lots of beachside cafes, ice cream shops and restaurants to choose from. I love this place."
Old fashioned seaside fun!,"If a clean beach with white sand, near old school amusements and the pier is what you are after then this is it! Also really close to lots of ice cream, sandwich and pasty style booths, cafes and a few restaurants. Good old fashioned family beach vibes! Bournemouth gardens are also really close if you fancy some shade, a stroll and a change of scenery for a bit."
Lovely beech,"The beach front here is very nice, plenty of space and all very clean. Plenty of places to get food and drinks nearby"
On of the Best Beaches in Britain,"It genuinely is one of the best beaches in Britain. Hands down a winner! Sun, sea, golden sands, a pier, lots nearby restaurants and a cliff lift.  Just trust me!"
Wonderful,"Beach is so clean , fine sand and blue sea. West beach cliff lifts a must, I first went on those over 50 years ago and Amazing they are still there and have been kept going, obviously not the originals, which were wooden and blue. Everywhere so clean bright and the pier delightful Worth a visit"
Sun sea and sand.,"Beautifully clean. Perfect sand, no rubbish and plenty of seats along  the front. A real treat. Would highly recommend to all groups."
Beautiful ,Always a lovely place to visit. Beautiful golden sands. Definitely one of England's best resorts with plenty to see and do
Great Beach but.....,"I was gobsmacked by the amount of people walking around smoking marijuana, every couple of yards you got a whiff of it. So obvious, it was like being in Amsterdam! Also noted some shady characters walking around. Shame really because it could be a really nice place. I won't be screaming to go back."
Beautiful beaches,Such lovely sandy beaches. Odd coffee shop or place to eat along front. Aquarium too. Not enough benches to sit on as want you to hire a deckchair
One of the best beaches in the UK,"Part of the seven miles of golden sand along the Jurassic Coast, Bournemouth Beach has a lively tourist end with bars and restaurants, and a more secluded, quiet, windswept end for gentle strolls. Clean, well-managed and outstanding natural beauty."
Lovely sand,"Having visited Bournemouth beach today with their clean sandy beaches Fresh air and very tempting water ...The day was filled with sunshine laughter and people watching as everyone was just oozing happiness from the pleasure of the last of the years sunshine and trip to the beautiful sandy beaches,,"
Our favourite beach! ,"Can't fault it. Council run a tight ship and keep it very clean. Excellent kiosks with lovely ice cream, hot and cold drinks along the beach."
Beautiful UK Beach,"Came during the summer holiday and wow it was lovely. They had an air show event which was nice to see. I can imagine it being really busy when it's hotter. I did find a few things quite expensive, however it was worth the trip. The sea is clean and clear. Great for younger children too as it's quite shallow. Will definitely come again for next summer."
Perfect,picturesque and clean beach. Plenty to do around the beach and great environment for all ages. Lovely white sand
Cleanest beach I've seen !!!,"What a gorgeous beach and excellent facilities. Ideal for families short on pennies and wanting a great free way to keep the kids occupied. Plenty of toilets showers and coffee huts too. Only one thing I would have changed was the weather as it was mid september so was changeable to say the least. Caution for those with children there are cyclists around, beach patrol vehicles and a land train. All in all have to say I would visit again."
Bournemouth retail shopping area,"The beach, the gardens, the tourist areas I.e. restaurant area are really good, clean and enjoyable but oh! Bournemouth Council what a let down is the retail shopping area. The  filthy flooring in need of a good sweep and scrub the litter bins ought to be emptied it is shameful, glad I don’t pay business rates!"
Excellent Beach,The beach is lovely with golden sands and is extensive. I enjoyed my time walking along the promenade and eating Whippy Icecreams. There is some shops by the pier.Excellent fire work show we saw the beginning of September.
Nice clean beach,Lovely sandy beach which is well maintained and overseen by lifeguards. Plenty of places close by to grab refreshments. Have to stroll along here and paddle even if it is cold
Sun bathing.,"Great beach for sunbathing, swimming in sea.Even better when the sky opens ups and you get soaked.Very funny."
Weekend away,"What a lovely clean beach can’t wait to return and relax in the sun,the council must spend a lot of time and money to keep it so clean and award winning"
Great beach,"Absolutely gorgeous, this beach is 7 miles of lovely clean sand.  Cleaned every morning and a pleasure to look at and to walk/sit on. We did not go on the pier due to the cost. We particularly went the last weekend in August and enjoy the Air Show over this lovely beach.  Perfect"
Birthday ,Lovely beach and great weather . The beach was clean and is always very busy when the sun shines .. try the zip wire at the pier
