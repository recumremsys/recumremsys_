Today, when Lucknow has transformed drastically and there are hordes of departmental store and shopping malls ...the charm of Ganj pulls me still. I find excuses to visit it.

A day in the city,"Hazaratganj, a place which is a market has everything, from clothes to food to electronics. Basically its an open mall which has been there in Lucknow when none of the malls were there. A to Z everything is available and even has hotels for a beautifull stay."
Heart of Lucknow,Well maintain place of Lucknow. All top variety and all top brands are available at this place. multi purpose parking available here.The most unique things is all shop boards are in black colour no other colour used in hording or boards of shops.
Too much traffic,We had a car and driver but sat in traffic for two spells of 30 minutes without moving.  There is a good range of shops and the lanes are interesting but by the time you arrive you are fed up. I would give this area a miss due to the traffic.
Hazaratganj has lost it s charm!,Many years ago Hazratganj was a a charming area with well maintained shops & theatres . It was a pleasure to walk through the long verandas on both sides. It was extremely sad to see the decadence of this famous street.
Old City charm,"Nice to shop around in the lanes(if you know were to go), and eat chaat at the Royal Cafe, Dotted with old buildings and one can only imagine how beautiful it must have been in the old days. Love Lucknow, the city of  Asli Thezeeb"

Heart of city,Hazratganj is the heart of lucknow. Its just superb and amazing. But due to metro 🚈 construction there is lot of traffic . But thanks to multi level parking .
Nice,"A beautiful market in centre of city. Have lost its charm due to metro work bus as the work have started down finalizing it have again started to regain its original old view. There are stores of multiple brands ranging from clothing, fashion to electric apliences, banks and jewellery."
Was the heart of Lucknow,"Hazratganj, till a decade ago was the heart of Lucknow and was famous for evening strolls called 'Ganjing' but that era has passed and it is no more than a local market now. Infested with the ongoing Metro construction, you are better to avoid this place or else you will be stuck for quite a long time in the traffic."
Nice Markets and Monuments,"Hazratganj has historical monuments, markets, shops, churches and Tehzeeb (mannerisms) and Nafasat (sophistication) in people. We stayed there for three days and loved every bit of our stay. Universal Book Store, and all the places we visited were great."

Heritage Ignored by Ignoramous Lucknowians,"People in our country love to harp on our ancient culture and old traditions, but the reality is that they all stand by and watch areas like Hazratganj being destroyed by hoardings, garish sign boards and remodelling, with ZERO REGARD for the old arcades and elevations! The chaos that results is simply a mirror image of the minds of IAS officers, City Engineers, and our Municipal Commissioner!AWAZ! Awake!Save Hazratganj!"

Big name less to see,Heard a lot about this place. When. Reached was disappointed....Uber and ola taxi times are too long and you don't want to take any other modes of transportation...Area under construction and too crowded...not recommended to visit at this time.
Center of Attraction,It is main center of attraction of Lucknow. It is one of the Main business center .All buildings r in same colour. Old fashioned street light gives a heritage look.

Under construction,What used to be a hype shopping and strolling area is under metro construction. So walking and roaming is a problem. My estimate is that it may take another year or so before normalcy returns.
Best area to stay,"Central Lucknow.... close to all  the market s....easy access thru e-rickshawsBest place to stay ...to get the flavor of Lucknow.. hotel silvete, Arif castle...very close to sahara ganj mall"

Road side Boarding and Food,"The worst every stay I have ever received. Pathetic room service, even you can get morning surprise with no water in bathroom/toilet. You will hardly get 2/3 items in break fast. Repeated requests are required for a single room service."
Ganjing is the correct word for it,"Heart of Lucknow. This is the place for all generations. It has shops for old people also with a tinge of modern spice, making it a must visit place in Lucknow. Its comparable to CP in Delhi or New Market in Bhopal or Powai in Mumbai"
Hazratganj heart of Lucknow,"Hazaratganj is really heart of Lucknow. It is the centre of Lucknow which is famous for its shopping centres, food courts, and many more things to do here."
Lucknow downtown,Hazratganj is like the heart of the city....it is where all the actions is....symmetrical shops and a great many places to eat....there is traffic most of the time...at all times some construction work is going on...

"Ganjing is slightly cumbersome , thankfully, temporarily","Named after Queen Hazrat Mahal of Oudh, Hazratganj has not lost its charm despite opening of various malls in Lucknow. The romance of Ganjing still cruises along. These days due to Metro construction half the Ganj road is blocked and the traffic snarles along but this is temporary pain for one to one and a half more years, till the underground metro is complete. Shop in Ganj or adjoining Janpath market in the evenings and savour the delicacies at any of the restaurants present there at dinner time"

good place,"this place is nice and good for shopping, you can roam around any time, there are some good cloth shops also"
OLD GRANDEUR LOST TO PRESENT,Hazratganj is not the same anymore. Visiting Lucknow after many decades the 'old charm' of Hazratganj was totally missing. Wish someone who really could understand and appreciate the 'historical' value of Hazratganj was in charge! it would have been nothing less than London Bond Street or New York Times Square if redevelopment was done by merging History with Modernization.

You name it....No dearth of excellent chikan garments  in Janpath market, melt in the mouth gajak/revari, or anything else you want to buy for gifting purposes...Everything is available here. Hazratgunj is definitely the heart of Lucknow, physically and metaphorically !!!"
British Lucknow feel,"Hazratganj is the classic British era buildings, and the Connaught place of Lucknow. You can spend an entire day here and still be left wanting for more of the experience.There are a host of great places to eat here, and most of them are very good."

Love it."
Shopping arcade ,Rather you will enjoy the shopping and eating on this road. Monument is a different part of this road. Lots of brands and restaurants offices just like CP. but a straight road. Metro work is going on so you can't enjoy the real charm of this road. Start a walking 🚶 in evening. You will enjoy.

Best for Spend evening,Hazarat ganj is famous for better felling in evening so  I go to there mostly but at this time making track for metro so here may be traffic any time.
Heart of LucknowHazratganj,really every one who visited Lucknow and pass through Hazratganj then say it is only the HEART OF LUCKNOW. Still here at Hazratganj we get the really of our old ruler   culture . Whenever you get chance to see Hazratganj. Pl. have a taste of meetha pan gilory.
"The Aan, Baan & Shaan of Lucknow","Hazratganj the High Street & soul of Lucknow. It’s the “Aan, Baan & Shaan” of Lucknow. It represents the culture and easy life style of this Awadhi Capital. If you are in Hazratganj a leisurely stroll or Ganjing  is must in the covered verandahs popularly known as Lovers Lane. It’s a shopper’s paradise whether you like to go for Lucknowi Chikan or any modern dresses Hazratganj  is full of beautiful showrooms. If you are a foodie you can go for Mughlai dishes, delicious chaat, or a classy dinner,  there are choicest restaurants."
Hazratganj the Pride of Lucknow,"Hazratganj the High Street of Lucknow represents the culture and easy life style of the Capital of Awadh. Go for a leisurely stroll or Ganjing in the covered verandahs popularly known as Lovers Lane, enjoy chikan shopping in Janpath , chaat at Sharmas Chaat House, followed by Kabab biryani and handi meat in Royal Cafe, Kulfi in Moti Mahal and a delightful paan to refresh you. My favourite hangout   Hazratganj is not just a street but a living magnet."
Heart of lucknow,"Hazratganj is soul of lucknow. If you are coming to lucknow first time then you should always go to hazratganj once. They have all types of showrooms there and near there is a computer market called lalbagh. Hazratganj is very famous for its night life. Very good to go. So if you are in hazratganj then you should go to sahara ganj mall,meena bazaar,gomati nagar, aminabad etc. Because it is in the middle of every place in lucknow. Suppose if you are in Agra and you didn'TV see the Tajmahal....then what is the use of travelling to Agra....same situation is with hazratganj. So , in the end, ""muskuraiye ki aap lucknow mein hain."" Besides it, it is also a favourite destination for bollywood to picturise their films.."
A marketplace seeped in history,"There's a saying in Lucknow that a day without 'ganjing' is a day incomplete.

Full on masti,Enjoyed a lot with my friends on the very first day of the year one of the most beautiful places in the city.
Great place to visit,We loved being in the labyrinth. Not for senior citizens. Keep your cell phones charged to be able to use the torch in the labyrinth.
The twin of Chandani Chowk,"Chaotic Indian bazaar. Green shoots of modernity effortlessly co-existing with traditional and historic. Old relics are being refreshed as boutiques, restaurants, offices and saloons. The place has a great character. You could buy haute couture right next to a corner kiosk selling fresh, crisp and delicious kachauri. For the latter be warned the charges are so low that it takes you back to the old days when eating street food was not reverse snobbery but the real deal."
