One of the best museum in Moscow,"We have been here 3 times and each time like a first time. Cant wait to come back next year!!!!!! Amazing energy, incredible art, some lines to get tickets, but worth waiting for"
It worths,"Excellent gallery where you can found the best Russian art. It is a great experience. It is huge. Only one advice, take something warn as the air conditioning is a little low."
Do yourself a favour - visit this unique museum,"If you find yourself in Moscow, then this is a place which is not to be missed.  A unique - and very impressive - collection of Russian art which cannot be compared to anything else you've seen in other museums around the world, in a very beautiful setting."
The best art gallery in Moscow!,"I wanted to visit this museum for a very long time. I’m Russian and I grew up on the most of the paintings that are in this marvelous collection. I came here with my husband, who is a foreigner, and we both really enjoyed the time we spent here. In fact, he said it was the top of all things we had time to do in Moscow! You need at least 2 hours here. Please plan accordingly. The price to enter is 500 rubles, which was equal €6-7 during the time of the visit and is very low for such a museum. Also, like most places in Moscow, they have a wardrobe downstairs (where you buy tickets), and there are several cute gifts shops and a cafe. The staff was very helpful too and answered my questions about the gallery with pleasure."
Local Russian Art,"A great visit if you are interested in Russian art. Lots of history, worth using audio or a guide to explain the origin of the artwork."
Old and good gallery ,We’ve been here more then 2 hours standing and walking by 60 rooms but we didn’t notice how the time was going... there were many great works....
Long waiting experience,There were huge queue to buy tickets and also Monday is closed day for the gallery. Best advise - to buy tickets online prior the visit and enjoy. We spend around 4 hours walking there visiting around 60 rooms. There also small church in the left from the entrance which is working as museum as well - nice tidy with very bright pictures and icons.
Gallery,"A great place , houres to spend ! You can see here multy painting styles . We did it on a rainy day and it was a solution for the problem of: what to do on a rainy day at Moscow."
as fantastic as valways!,"The stare of arts picktures collected in this museum are very reaach and emotional! We see not only Aivazovski but Perov, Repin, Vasnetsov and many more who influences society thinking of 19th century. Breathtaking  even many pictures were familiar"
wonderful painting gallery,My wife and I went there during NYE period. We came once at 13h but found a neverend queue so we decided to come earlier the following day ... Same issue but then we waited and spent one hour and half before we entered.The collection is great : it starts with the first paintings / portraits ordered by the tsar to show his power to Europe. I recommend the end of the exhibition - this is the most interesting part with wonderful sea paintings or the traditional russian fairy tails.I recommend also to book in advance on the net : you will then avoid the queue :-)
Discover realism at its best !,You need more than 4 hours to really check everything out. Really nice realistic paintings based on a myraid of themes.
Not for kids,After a few rooms the kids got bored and complained a lot. This doesn’t mean it isn’t any good for people wanting to view century year old art.
Must visit - wonderful collection of art,"I visited several art galleries in Petersburg after this one, but this still remains my favourite. The audio guide is excellent and kindled a lot of interest and curiosity to know more about Russian culture and history. The exhibits are arranged in a very structured and systematic way. Not worth missing - spend a good part of a day at minimum for this gallery."
the place to see Russian art,"Last time I visited the gallery nearly 30 years ago. Nothing changed, only the line became longer. Here you see the whole history of Russian pictures from XVII century primitive painting to the beginning of XX-th century"
Must visit gallery in Moscow.,"Buy your tickets online and go during the week, Russians love their cultural heritage sights and flock there on weekends. I was there on a Sunday afternoon and we stood in the line for 1 hour to get tickets. I visited the a Vasily Polenov exibition a great late 19th and early 20th century Russian artist. The Tretyakov is an amazing facility."
Good collection of Russian Art,Good collection of Classic Russian Art and Iconography. Don’t miss the seascapes of Ivan Aivazovsky.
amazing works of art,an amazing collection of pre revolution russian and also soviet art also lots of magnificent icons highlly recomenedfound the souviner shop rather lacking though
"If you have even a passing interest in Russian art, this museum is a must-see.","There are some of the finest paintings from Russian artists like Ilya Repin and Vasily Surikov here. Other sections of the museum hold icons from the medieval period, painted by masters such as Andrei Rublev and Feofan Grek. The icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev is one of the most famous icons ever created. The entire museum is a feast for the eyes and if one has even the slightest interest in the subject matter, unmissable."
Beautiful collection of art,It was great experience to be there and see the the beautiful art Galery. The only thing that you need to watch out for is the huge queue. There is no golden ticket to get to the gallery so the best way is to get the guided tour.
Very impressing collection of art !!!,So many russian paintings so many beautiful paintings and some statues ! take an audio so you can follow to put in the numbers with a good explanation via Audio! take you time and also admire the building and interior itself.A must see if you are interested in russian art.
Impressive collection of art!,"Huge collection of famous russian and international paintings, beautifull interior of the gallery, but illumination in some rooms could be better, it was hard to find a point of view to some paintings without blind spots from the lights. Not very busy on winter week days."
Russian history and legend in art,Both world reknowned and unknown artists of Russia are represented.  There is a vast amount of history and folklore interpreted through art.
Incredible Collection,The best Museum for Russian paintings. An incredible collection of paintings by the top Russian painters. A must see if you are into Russian art or an art lover in general. Well presented and easily viewed.
Interesting Russian history,Nice museum. A perfect way to enjoy art and learn about Russian history. Perfect size: 2 to 3 hours is OK for a visit.
Anazingly beautiful paintings,Beautiful historical place. There are so many famous russian artists. Paintings are incredibly good and interesting too. Be ready to spend couple hours of walking around . They also provide English speaking guides
Great option to see Russian artists,"Went there to get to know more about Russian artists (from Icons until 19th century, I believe)  and was not disappointed. Easy access from metro, nice neighbourhood, beautiful estate. Gladly discovered some great russian painters and sculptors. Did not use audio guide, but you can do well without it. Museum Map easy to follow."
Delightful museum,"Easy to get to, signs well marked on the street and a fullexperience of art and how it shows history."
Overwhelming,One of the nicest galleries I have ever seen. It is a collection of mostly paintings and sculptures by Russian artists from the 11th until the end of the 19th century
What a nice suprise... ,If you like art and especially Russian art this is the place. The touching history of the family along with the very very rich collection of art will not dissapoint you for choosing this gallery. Take your time to observe the  paintings. They represent a lost era of Russia. And do not miss the magnificent Icons collection! Wow and really not something you see everyday..
not worth it without a guide,"the art displayed is great and beautiful. but unfortunately it's pretty complex to understand most of the things as it's in Russia a lot. this museum is great for Russian history, but without a guide you won't get much info, as we experienced"
An amazing history of modern Russian Art,"Once you've got over having to queue to get in (small numbers are admitted every 20 minutes to buy tickets while pre-purchasers get in without queuing) the gallery is absolutely amazing.  If you've seen Russian art in a western gallery then you've seen lots of famous paintings.  Here you'll see so many earlier works by famous artists that it really contextualises your knowledge. If you've never seen any of this art before, it is still worth the 600R as you'll be treated to a room of Chagall, a room of Kandinski and a great collection of Popova and Falk.  The sculpture clection is small but excellent and outside the gallery is the sculpture museum which is worth an hour of anyone's time.  We'll worth coming on a Wednesday when entry is free or any day that you give yourself 4 hours or more to see the vast exhibition here."
Amazing Art collection,"Don't miss this amazing collection of Russian fine art. Stunning paintings you must see include ""The Girl with the Peaches"", ""The Apotheosis of War"" and ""The Rainbow"". Our guide explained the most important paintings which was good as you could spend hours in here and still not see all of the greatest works! Photography is allowed inside the gallery and we took lots of photos of the paintings so we could remember them afterwards."
Fall in love with Russian paintings,"After so many years, I am still impressed with the beauties of Russian painters that can be found in the Tretyakov. This museum is a must to discover Russian paintings, some of them breathtaking. Take your time, the permanent  collection is immense and there is a lot to see. Parallel, there might also be very interesting exhibitions. However, since Russians love going to museums, expect long cues for the temporary shows during the weekend."
Great visit,It's the only good museum in moscow!Really I try them all...Lot of great art! From all timesEasy to see all.. lot of space
State Tretyakov Gallery,"Fabulous place, lots of beautiful arts, representing Russian History. Gorgeous building but has a lot of staircase and no elevators. Reccomend"
Art Gallery,"We visited as part of a guided tour of Moscow. Wish we had come here earlier as we had seen so much art in the city, we had just about had our fill of art. Don't get me wrong the collection is stunning as well as the building it is housed in. Well worth a look."
Excellent gallery,We enjoyed more than 2 hours in this very extensive gallery tracing the evolution of Russian art. Each room had large print cards in multiple languages with interesting notes on the major works and artists.
From Russia with love,A wonderful place for painting and sculpture lovers. Russian art in its best way. ONE OF THE BEST ART MUSEUMS IN THE WORLD
Well worth a visit,"A huge place, and well worth a few hours to wander through. We went there by metro, then walked down to the river afterwards and turned left and walked along into and through Gorky Park."
Comparison: like the Minneapolis one but on steroids,My exposure to lots of Russian art (more than the few selections you may find in your local art museum) sadly only existed in two places I’ve visited: Stateside was the Russian art museum in an old church in Minneapolis. The other was this one in Moscow.  They both have displays of Russian painters as well religious icons to appreciate.  The Tretyakov Gallery has 2 levels and I recommend grabbing a free map near the ticketing area to help guide your walking as some of the rooms don’t flow as intuitively walking from one era (not misspelled) to the next. The Minneapolis is 3 levels and easier to navigate as it is much much smaller. Minneapolis also has a Matroishka exhibit in their basement worth seeing (see my separate review of that galley on TA if you want to read more). This review isn’t for those that love Russian art as you’ll visit this museum regardless of reviews.  However if you appreciate art in general but aren’t familiar with Russian art then you must visit the Tretyakov museum to broaden your horizons like I did. I liked the landscape and nature paintings the most as there was an intensity to the style you won’t find in artwork from Europe during the similar era.  Bottom line: if you can only visit one art museum while in Moscow then this is the one to visit. If you don’t have a passport then go to Minneapolis instead.
Old Tretyakov Gallery,"This is a must see in Moscow.  On the Saturday afternoon I visited it was jam packed but still, the massive amount of high quality Russian Impressionist work is amazing"
vast amount of beautiful collection,totally worth the price! Large collection of paintings and beautiful statue. We spent 2 hours here and almost skipped lunch since we wanted to take a detail look of each exhibit. The building itself is so pretty and big. You don't have to buy online ticket. No long queue and i think no daily quota (unlike kremlin)
Great Russian Art!,"A little difficult to get to but worth it. If you don’t get a guide, the audio is suggested.We don’t get a lot of Russian art exposure and the transition from painting only icons to classics is interesting to see unfold."
I love the place,Actually is world famous. Not much I can add to this except that the closure to time is too early and the washrooms are absolute mess. The art inside is classic which shall not be comment  of course. Facilities itself need a improvement for sure
Beautiful Collection,The building itself was worth a visit. The architecture was stunning. The collection was well worth seeing and had many great artistis.
Our favorite museum in Moscow,"We visited Tretyakov-gallery in July, and studied the art there for several hours. The collection consists of Russian art from 1200-1900, and is very impressive. I think I was most taken by the Icons, how wonderful they were, and huge and mysteriously beautiful. Andrej Rublev's icons were particularly touching. But it was also great to see all the old russian art for instance GN Sergeyevna, Ilya Repin and many others. The vibe and atmosphere was great. And so was the cafe. Also: the Tretyakov-gallery is a fine pendant to the Russian art museum in St Petersburg. Please go!"
How a gallery should ,"The art in this gallery is wonderful, bold, ambitious, world class, showing key Russian masters, and mistresses, up to the early 1900s. On that basis alone it should be on everyones must do list.But where it excels, and gets totally right what most other attractions in Moscow get totally wrong, is the support structure OK, so we had a queue, around 15 minutes in the rain from 10.20 on a Saturday morning,  but nothing like as bad as we feared from other reviews. Nor did we encounter any confusing 2nd queues.Once inside there were 4 ticket desks so no hold up there, and many cloakroom acceptance points.And it then also hadA free plan of the layout30 key works, with photos, identified on that planEnglish labels on almost every exhibitA wonderful audio-guide that really bought the paintings aliveA logical, numbered room by room route throughOn most rooms a pretty detailed room info leaflet, available in several languages. State Historical Museum and the Museum of Contemporary History could both learn an awful lot from here on how to run a good gallery"
Lots of Very Cool Art,"Spent half a day going through this museum/gallery. Lots of history there along with many stunning artworks. If you are into art, then this is your place"
Russian art,In this museum you can admire Russian art from the very old past till the end of 19th century. The icon's section is interesting because often we western european citizens don't know this art very well. It is a very interesting exploration even if you will not find kandinsky or chagall because they moved it to the new tretyakov (so be advised). for this i was disappointed.
THE RUSSIAN LOUVRE,I had never heard of this place but my Moscow cousin took us there.  It is apparently the main historical museum of Russian fine art.I was impressed by the quality of the paintings which were mainly from the 1600s through to the 1917 Revolution.  It was like being in the Louvre but without the crowds.It is ironic that Russian classical music is so well known around the world but Russian art which is of the same quality is hardly known.
"One of the BEST Art Museums I’ve ever visited, mainly (but not only) specializes in Russian art.","An amazing gallery, NOT ONLY fort art lovers.Russian art at its best, from Tretyakov's collection  We came with our own guide and she gave us explanations and background on the pictures and what stands behind the paintings in terms of colors, views or objects. Both historically and artistically.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
The full range of Russian Art in one place,"The gallery is rather hidden away in a back-street though close to major thoroughfares south of the Moskva River.  One queues in a courtyard - it's worth trying to get there before the official opening at 1000, though the location away from the Kremlin/Red Square means that the gallery is not so stuffed with humanity as some other attractions.  The rooms with works by Ivanov and portraits by Kiprensky are the busiest, but both the huge works and the intimate portraits are worth seeing.  For those who dash around a gallery with their camera phone gathering images rather than looking, many of the pictures are both photogenic and readily captured.  For those who prefer to linger and look, it is wise to avoid the tour groups.  One is not allowed to photograph the medieval exhibits such as wooden panels but these are definitely worth simplly staring at for ages.  A first rate gallery and covering artists whose works are rare in western Europe.  The souvenir shop has the standard types of gifts and there is a useful cafe.  Thoroughly recommended."
Russian art at its finest,Expect long lines in summer and book in advance. We arrived just before they open at 10 a.m. and the lines were huge but our pre-booked museum guide took us in through a rear entrance. All the best in Russian art over the centuries. The viewing rooms are spacious and the washroom and cafeteria facilities very good. Tickets are not expensive.
Eduard Munch Exhibition ,"A fantastic collection of works from his museum in Oslo with some bits added from from Russian museums. It wasn't just the Scream, but a lot of other works covering all periods of his life and depicting his sorrows, fears and struggles. The Tretyakov Gallery staff were polite and professional dealing with people queueing for four (like we did) to six hours on other days, according to some comments online, and tried to admit as many people as possible despite the late hour (on the very last night the ticket office was open untill 10pm)."
Rublev's icons and other Russian painters,I went to see Rublov and begun to queue in a very long line.. After a while I realised there are two entrances one for the historical and permanent exhibition other for temporal in my case for Munk... So be sure what you want to visit to choose the right building.. Paintings are stunning one need 2-3 hours..
Russian History in Paintings,"Fabulous museum, it displays the Russian history in paintings. Recommend a minimum half day visit, with a break having lunch or snacks at its restaurant."
1 of the BEST Art Museums,"the location is a bit off from the RED Square but don't let it discourage your plan to visit.the museum boasts a great, unmatched collection of paintings, sculptures, artifacts of Russian or foreign origins.not as ""big"" as the Hermitage in St Petersburg but it is still the place for art enthusiasts."
Many many portraits... ,"From the time before cameras. There are only so many portraits that you can look at but, if this is your thing, you'll love it.Buy your tickets in advance and go to Gate No. 1 - only a 30 minute wait instead of double."
A must see in Moscow,It gives an exellent view on Russian art ( paintings icons ...). A Very nice museum! You can easily walk and admire the art in two hours.
A very interesting Art Museum!,Don't miss the Tetryakov Gallery in Moscow. Get to know Art History and Russian painters. Impressive exposition!
Really Enjoyed with Teenagers,"Beautiful artwork by Russian artists. We had never been exposed to such, and really enjoyed it!  If you like art, it’s certainly worth it!  Our guide highlighted about 2 dozen pieces and my teenagers commented on how they really enjoyed the gallery as well."
Very nice,If you like art this is a must go with the biggest and well organized in chronological sequence art from Russia
Beware of the correct queue ,"The gallery itself is amazing, but my experience of it is not.Of course, I could have avoided some of the mishaps by being better prepared, but not all.Here's the things:If you come from Tretyakovskaja metro, don't be fooled or discouraged by the huge queue which you will notice first - that's for something else, maybe another part of the museum complex, I'm not sure. Anyway, I stood in this line like the patient fool I am, for more than an hour, until I overheard some people discussing some other queue which is shorter. I decided to investigate, and promptly found the real entrance, where I flew through within a minute.Now, once you're in, don't bother with the ticket machine if you don't read Russian - as far as I gathered, they're only in Russian.So, instead, go down the stairs where there's a main hall of ticket booths, cloak room, shop, toilets, info desk, etc.Get your tickets here, and you're good to go. It can happen that a ticket booth closes right before your nose while it's almost your turn - it happened to me - but don't be discouraged, after a bit more queueing at another booth, you will surely get a ticket.After that, everything is easy. And the art is gorgeous.Just the entrance... That's pretty exhausting."
So sorry we didnt have enough time,A terrific collection of spectacular quality art. We started at late 18th Century to 19th Century and not having been well versed in Russian Art we went through very very slowly.  Each room has a card with a description of the paintings in different languages.
A very impressive collection,"I didn't know what to expect when we entered the Tretyakov Gallery, that was on our tour itinerary. It didn't take long to figure out that many of the paintings reflect the Russian history and shed light on events, communities and the way people lived. I believe that on my next visit to Moscow, I'll find enough time to deeply explore this wonderful gallery."
Excellent collection of Russian art,"Excellent collection of Russian art.We took our South Friends there, great art lovers, to get them aquatinted with Russian masters. They were very impressed."
Interesting,Thought we booked a tour to a different museum but still not disappointed. This gallery all Russian artist from 1100 to 1900. Interesting the contrast in styles from European masters to Russian masters. We had an individual tour guide who was very knowledgeable about the paintings. Very enjoyable. Plan on at least three to four hours.
The NEW Tretyakov Gallery,"We were excited to discover the gallery was open on a holiday .. and because it was Wednesday, it was FREE!!  Lovely contemporary art gallery !"
Being Rude should not be part of any culture!!! We are in the 21st century. Wake Up!!!,Russia needs to catch a wake up. I have visited 37 countries and Moscow tops my list of most unwelcoming to foreigners. I bother to work hard and save my weak South African Rand to pay for my way there and walk for miles and miles to admire the beauty such an unfriendly nation has produced...only to be met with impatient staff and service providers that do not realise that as foreigners we are an asset to their economy. At the Tretyakov Edvard Munch exhibition l was treated with such racism and felt like a criminal as an impatient ticket office ASSUMED i was in the wrong building and sent me to another queue to make sure l knew where l was. BEING FOREIGN DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE STUPID...WE DO OUR RESEARCH BEFORE WE VISIT!!! And security guards need to treat visitors with respect. I felt like l was entering a prison. Unfortunately...beautiful or not....a country's popularity DOES MOST CERTAINLY lie in its people and although l do respect each culture's manner and processes....THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BEING RUDE TO ANYONE IN THIS WORLD...ESPECIALLY IF THEY BRINGING THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY TO MAKE YOUR COUNTRY RICHER. Make an effort Russians if you want a better life for yourselves you must sow friendliness back into the universe. AND START TO EMPLOY ENGLISH SPEAKING STAFF AT TOURIST SPOTS....THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES!!!!
Repin Exhibition - Great drawcard,"We heard that there is an exhibition of the collected works of Ilya Repin, one of the best portrait painters from Russia and one of the Abramsovo mob.  The exhibition is housed at the annex to the gallery, opposite Gorky Park.  It was packed on a Wednesday, midday so if you want avoid the crowds, go early (10:00).  The paintings are a spectacular display of one mans talent, in oils, charcoal, ink, water colors.  It takes up three floors of the gallery with hall after hall of brilliant portraits and crowd scenes.Go and see it while there is a chance.  Cost is 600 roubles pp"
one of my favorite places,"I'd put this in the top 5 of places to visit in Moscow. Even if you are not a huge fan of art, this is one of the best places to learn more about Russian history and culture and the incredible creativity, particularly of the 19th and 20th centuries. The building itself is lovely. Could not recommend enough."
Human Sized Museum,"The Tretyakov Gallery is one of those museums that do not frighten you with their vast collection of art and artifacts ! The facade is very interesting and attractive. The collection displays works from lots of Russian artists and has a wonderful collection of Russian Orthodox Icons--- the most famous one being the Trinity by Andrei Rublev, which was painted in the early part of the 15th Century.An interesting aside : the gallery was the venue for the famous FIDE World Chess Championship matches between Vishwanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand in 2002"
Very Impressed ,Lots of artwork here and aa lot of impressive pieces to view.  A must have guide is necessary to get the most out of the experience.  Too many details to miss with out the expertises.
Nice,Overblown with good art. I was really inpressed with how much good art there was. Really a must visit if you like museums.
A great gallery,"If you have more then 3 days in Moscow, or if you are a fan of russian painting, then you should definitely drop by this place. It’s great value and also one of the best tricks to spend some time while the weather outside is not ideal."
Great museum,"Pretty much a must visit in Moscow. Great exposure to Russian art,  including artists not well known abroad. Also, great museum layout, accessible, practical."
Wonderful gallery. Only Russian painters ,"We spent one morning visiting this great museum. We could have spent more time because of the huge amount of paintings it has. Even though we did not know any of the painters, the artistry of some of them was enough to captivate us. The only unavoidable (but acceptable) nuisance during our visit was the presence of many noisy young school children, since our visit was during a weekday. Hopefully, the museum management can put some more discipline into this issue. Out of this, the experience for us was memorable."
Come see some really amazing Russian art. worth a visit,"Your art history classes may have left out some amazing and beautiful Russian art. Remediate this deficiency by visiting the Tretyakov Gallery. This museum was absolutely beautiful.  In particular, the works of the 19th century, especially the realists were very very impressive.  At the suggestion of our tour guides,  due to time constraints, we skipped the Pushkin in favor of this very Russian art museum and we didn't regret it.The Louvre, Prado, Hermitage, et al are filled to the rafters with amazing western art, but if you are in Moscow, and have to choose, I'd strongly recommend a visit to the Tretyakov.  One minor side note though, if you don't speak Russian and you don't really enjoy Russian food, and you don't like staff that is borderline rude, you may want to skip the cafeteria, though overall we enjoyed that, too."
I enjoyed the visit.,I wanted to watch in real several paintings which I knew from the students book only. So my dream come true. I enjoyed the paintings of many famous artists. There is a good cafe inside the gallery with lots of dishes and low prices.
Good or Great Depending,"I enjoyed my visit and found the collection very educational, somewhat unfamiliar and well displayed. It is not for everyone, but I found it to be surprisingly attractive and an very informative experience."
Arrival Instructions: Make sure you go to the correct Ticket Office,"The photo on TA shows the correct location of entry to the Gallery and Ticket Office. Next door on the corner, which you will probably see first on arrival, is a red building with white arches, also signed Tretyakov with a Ticket Office, but this is not the correct entrance!! We joined the long queue at this building but after 20 minutes a young lady came out to tell everyone that we were in the wrong queue if we wanted to see the Tretyakov Collection!! Once inside the correct building and after security checks, there are ticket machines, but only in Russian language, so proceed down to the Basement level where you will find the Ticket Office, Toilets, excellent Cafe and Museum Shop. All the staff here were extremely friendly and happy to help. The Collection is laid out chronologically and by artist. We did not know any of these Russian painters, so it was great to see their individual works hung together in one room.  Make sure you pick up the brochure at the entrance after you have bought a ticket, and before you walk up stairs to the galleries, as the map is excellent. It also indicates by room the ""best regarded pictures"" which is handy if you are in a hurry to see the best of Russian Art. Make sure you also see the final rooms with magnificent icon paintings from the 11th Century onwards - they are incredibly well preserved."
My favourite gallery.,"Easy access, not crowded, such amazingly beautiful paintings from famous artists. Not expensive, only 500 roubles. My favourite is Princess Tarakanova! You have to visit this gallery."
Entrance security check spoils it all,"This gallery is a great treasure of Russian art, dedicating a section for every painter that contributed to art history of Russia. However, I spent 45 minutes in line waiting for the security check. The tellers were empty, there was nobody in front of them, but as they have only one metal detector gate at the entrance, visitors lose patience and are tired. I knew little about Russian art, and this gallery gave me good overview. However, if you are visiting Russian Museum in SPB, you can skip it since the collection is very similar."
Nice collection of Russian artists,This is a very nice museum that is also a good value. We saw lots and lots of works by Russian artists through the ages. Definitely worth the visit.
Spend Less Time here.,"There is a lot of second rate 19th and 20th century art here, a whole lot.  The icons at the entry are of interest, if that is your thing...you will have seen similar in St. Basil's and the Kremlin, so these are not necessary to get a flavor of  'the icon'.  The Tetrrakov Modern"
Well organized story teller!,"A must to go place in Moscow, if you want to be exposed in Russian arts. Don't forget to stop by St. Nicolas - ""Our Lady of Vladimir"" by Andrey Bogolyubsky, 12C the great icon painter."
"One man's collection, of variable quality","This assembly of Russian art is interesting, but there is little which is memorable. Earlier paintings are poor imitations of Western European art, it is not until the late nineteenth century that the landscapes start to look a bit Russian. There were a few really good portraits (of Dostoievsky and Tolstoy, for example) but some awful depictions of scenes from Russian myths and legends, with dead bodies galore."
Lovely gallery,"Lovely gallery, I have visited it since I was a child. Good selection of Russian paintings. It is quite small, so it makes for a comfortable visit. This review is for the old building."
Great visit with great guide!,This visit was highly recommended to us and I must say I am very happy we had the opportunity to visit this great museum. We would just have loved to have more time. We will need to return sometime.
Don’t make it a priority on your list,The place is huge and the most valuable art are few paintings from Kandinsky and One from Chagall.Interesting Sovietic art on display.The rest does not have much merit. The kind of works you see are similar to any street fair.
Nice Gallery,We liked very much about Tretyakov Gallery. I'm not an art specialist but I founded myself to enjoy all the art I saw.
"If you love art, don't miss this gallery. ","Large collections of Russian and European art. I was not familiar with most of the Russian artists, but their work was inspiring. The Russian art ranged from icon art to realistic, impressionist, modern and post-modern."
We were museumed out,"After two weeks of touring museums and churches in the Baltics and Russia, we were pretty much tired out but once we were inside the wonderful museum we became reenergized.  The art inside is seldom, if ever, seen outside Russia.  The paintings were wonderful glimpses of Russian life throughout the ages.  The quality was quite high. I really enjoyed this museum."
Must visit ,"If you have a passion for a culture you must visit ""tretyackovka"". Put it in your list of places you want to see in Moscow, sure you won't regret"
The museum for Russian Art,"Founded in 1856 by Pavel Tretyakov and presented as a gift to the city in 1892, this is the museum for Russian art. Dating back to the 12th century, the phenomenal collection is a rich opportunity to gain insight into the history of Russia. All pieces are labeled in English. Laminated information sheets available."
Awesome place,This has to be one of those “must see” venues while visiting Moscow. Allow several hours to view everything. Wear comfortable shoes! Take a camera. Be prepared to be impressed.
Very mixed experience,"I just visited this museum and had very mixed experience.There is long line in front of the building no matter what time you get there. Do not bother to buy tickets online as you still have to stay the main and only line. I spend in the line about 45 minutes and at the time I was close to the entrance door and looked behind there were probably over 300 hundred people in the line. I was very curious why it took so long and guess what -- there was only one security guy who was checked you walking though the security frame and your bags. Unbelievable!!! The main Russian art museum has only one security and every person in the line that consist of few hundred people has to go through this guy!!!Then you walk inside and try to figure our how and where to buy tickets.Then you have to check in your jacket/coat any outwear. Be ready sometime to stay in another line and give your clothes to very unwelcoming staff.The collection is very good and worth your time to see however it is very difficult to enjoy the experience. There were crowds of kids from school different age starting from younger than 10 yo. Their teachers usually occupy so much space blocking the view of the paintings and they talked to the students in very high pitched voice and often even screaming. There was so many people on the phone (not just students)- I was in many world museums and never saw anything like this. I do not want to sound bad but Russian people are rude- they continuously pushing you, kicking you with their elbows, stepping on your feet. They will never say ""Im sorry"". Also, they never silence their phones and talk loudly right in front or behind of you. All of this takes away from the experience that could be excellent but at the end of the day was just average."
art museum ,Entry fee for an adult is 500 rubles. The art is displayed in rooms over two floors. A lot of great art. It can get pretty busy at times.
The wonderful collection ,"It’s a most visited place when you visit Moscow , it’s collection variety from sculptures, icons and paintings are awesome and must seen , gift shop and cafe great also , and don’t forget to collect your memorial coin from the machine if you are a coins collector)"
Excellent exhibition,Visit on a working day in the morning is good. Taking audio guide is a must - little  printed info available in the halls. Be prepared to leave 2000rub. deposit or document at the audio guide desk. Souvenir shops are also nice.
Not to be missed,"Many many paintings and several sculptures for art lovers. I paid for a portable guide in Spanish with the explanation of several of the masterpieces; I think it was kind of expensive, but it was necessary to get comments of what I saw. It was a good tool to see the gallery since names of the paintings were not exactly clear to read. I spent like half a day to see the exhibition, but I think it is worth of spending more time to appreciate the gallery better."
A great collection of several Russian authors,"Wide collection of paintings and sculptures from Russian masters. Plan to stay four hours if you want to see everything without rush.The museum looks like a store with all the paintings hanging without charm. It could have a higher style.The line at the entrance was long and outdoors, slightly messy because of rude visitors, mainly women, which were pushing others away instead of asking for permission to pass."
Take a comfortable shoes and enjoy!,The permanent collection of the Gallery is simply beautiful especially if you like landscapes and portraits. And entrance fee affordable to anybody. We'll definiteli come here again!
An absolute for Russian art history enthusiasts,"The Tetryakov Gallery is a this mind blowing orgy of 1 Russian art.....so many more rooms and works! My main interests are in 19th century works to which I sirected most of my visit (though Russian iconic art with Orthodox themes also anound here).The gallery serves to also understand so much in Russian history overall e.g. the nationalist reassertion of traditional Russian themes in the aftermath of victory over Napoleon, which are seen in many works here.I can only highlight a few of my favs and with some of my  pics:-- Masterpieces by Perov, leader of the Wanderers, a second half 19th cent. social realist rebellion against academic and religious art.-Khudyakov's Skirmish With Finnish Smugglers, 1853- portraits of Leo TolstoyOutside stands a statue of artist Ivan Repin.The gallery store is excellent, though translations on English are scarce....but more,m luck if you also read French (or Russian, of course).One of my best experiences in Moscow!"
BRILLIANT RUSSIAN ART,"There are 2 Tretiakov galeries in Moscow: one in Gorki park (about 20th Century Russian art), and the other near Tretyakovskaya subway station (which houses an encyclopedic collection of Russian Art from Medieval times up to the early Twentieth Century).Wé found it far more interesting than the Pushkin museum which has many copies of art works...Here, everything is authentic and unique!Amazing Russian masterpieces never seen in Europe which help understand Russia's history.Don't miss:Repin,Kiprensky,Vereschragin,Gay,Serov,and Vrubel.This art museum has a nice cafeteria.Art works are labelled and explained in English.Guards are lovely!"
A must visit,You can find there the most important pieces of Russian art. World heritage paintings like Rublev's Trinity or Kiprensky's Pushkin portrait. Audioguides in various languages. Wonderful. Must see if in Moscow.
Great collection ,Overall it was well worth visiting here. I made 2 attempts to go. The first had a 300m line out the front as it was around 11am and the second about 6pm. Going later at night was great because there was no line and it was a bit quieter. The collection here was great however too many portraits for my liking. Cost was ₽500 and a spent a few hours walking around
Interesting,We did this with a guide which turned it from average to interesting. The paintings mean so much more when you understand who was up who and who was paying. The power plays were fascinating. Oddly one of the “princesses” kept getting taken off her husbands and married by someone higher up the ladder. Though she started as a peasant. Reminds me of Evita Not a must see but does cover history
A museum that Mezmerazing ,I never felt so happy and touched on this museum.All the history and excitement that will create on your feelings.A must see place for everyone who travel to moscow
A Whole Day Experience,"To truly experience the joys of Russian art, one would need at least one whole day to truly experience the richness of this art gallery. Some paintings really stood out, such as the Ivan the Terrible one. Since we had limited time, we had to rush through everything and managed to cover the entire gallery in about 3 hours. But for a true art buff, i would recommended giving more time."
Arkhip Kuindzhi exhibition will be over soon. Run to see it ASAP,"We visited just to see Arkhip Kuindzhi masterpieces. He is real wizard of paint.Rush, the exhibition will be over soon."
"It is awesome, an absolutely must to visit.","Tretyakov gallery is a huge collection of masterpieces (paintings, sculptures) from different epochs, both by Russian/soviet masters and foreign artists. It has a number of very famous Masterpieces, including, for instance, ""Ivan the Terrible kills his son"" by I. Repin and ""The three strongmen"" by Vasnetzov. In my opinion, it compares much more favorably with say Zwinger museum in Dresden or similar exhibits."
"Masterpiece e.g. Trinity God, the Prodigal Son. Mary Mother of God",No where in this world but saw the masterpieces Russia. Trinity God is the Orthodox God..e.g. sculptor. shown in Yarosclav
Simply amazing!,This place is showcasing some of the best Russian artwork you can find under one roof. It looks small from outside but enormous from inside with room after room filled with great paintings. I spent over 4 hours 30 minutes walking from one room to another without a break and only realized it when received a call as I had to leave. Even then I missed few rooms and some I had to visit in a rush. I think 6 hours would have been sufficient.
A must see museum - russian art,"Must see place of russian Art. I recommend taking a tour guide (you can even search for one on Instagram-will be cheaper and faster than getting an English speaking guide at the museum in advance). The tour will be quite fast (1.5-2h), and would cover the main paintings. If you go without a guide, I would recommend making sure to go to the hall with paintings inspired by russian folklore-don’t forget to read about it or take an audio guide."
Russian Art in one great collection,"If you cannot see the Russian Museum in St Petersburg, then this Gallery is a must. Much smaller of course, but it does give a sense of history"
Great Museum,Excellent museum. Lots to see. Part of Moscow Pass . Allow lots of time to spend here. I would definitely recommend this museum.
A must go Moscow's art museum,"I absolutely loved this place. The place didn't look huge but the exhibit rooms were so knitted that I spent more than 3 hours in this main gallery building. The arts were interesting, alive, and detailed at the same time. Stunning !I didn't have to wait long to get my ticket (3 people in front of me) on a Sunday. The other wing of the gallery (I was told the newer one) has a crazy long queue. However, a friend told me he was there on Saturday and the long queue was at this main building instead. I gathered it is probably better to plan ahead and get the ticket online in advance unless you are always the impromptu type.One can easily spent almost a day in the gallery if you can stay in without lunch/food. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Check out the place to find out and see the place for your self if you love different kind of painting portraying a good rich Russian culture, history, and lifestyle."
Amazing gallery,The visit was not on the plan. Our guide insisted we should visit the gallery. It was worth every penny (as they say)! The Muzeon park outside is also impressive.
great place to spend a day,"we really loved th collection of this museum. I think it is very well organised and presented. We had our lunch in the restaurant there, it was very good as well"
You can spend many hours here,This is a beautiful art gallery and you can spend many hours here. Highly recommended for any lover of art.
"If you enjoy art, prepare to spend more than a few hours here :)","First the tickets, I bought at the door as I do not know if queue was long.now on the art pieces, really love what was on display. I am not familar with Russian artists, but I really think they matches the European masterpieces, it just makes one feels satisfied appreciating the art. It is something you have to see in person to feel the depth and feel of the art pieces (eg. luminosity, paint pigment), like a good glass of vintage wine. Just want to add that I am very impressed with the skills of the artists and felt lucky was able to enjoy viewing so many beautiful art pieces at one go. This is certainly one of my most memorable visit in Moscow.Though I had wished there was a good light collection book of sorts that I could bring home."
Art gallery,"This was part of the tour but quite interesting if you like art, not entirely our thing but there was some interesting painting"
Plan ahead,You need whole day if you want to be able to see the whole gallery. It is packed with interesting pieces. The area where gallery is located is packed with interesting streets and churches. Do some research about the area.
Worth visiting,You’d better have a free day to visit the place. Lots of artworks and many well known masterpieces. You can take a brochure to navigate at the place.
"If you like Russian art, it is the place!","The State Tretiakov Gallery is a museum, specially of paintings, located in Moscow, the main city of Russian Federation. Here you can see the museum with more works of Russian art in the world. Really, if you like or you want to know the Russian art in the history, it is the place you have to visit! It was very interesting for me, I enjoy a lot. Also I visited the place at the first of November-2018, when the National day was, and the museum these days was open 24 hours. Incredible! the most important museum of art in the city."
Painting lovers have a great time.,"Time very well spent. I had a wonderful time. Russian paintings of many eras.  The Modern Art is not represented. The Impressionists ( Russian ) and painters of the 19th  century were my favorite. Russia had many exquisite painters, not well known in the West. They are as good as western painters, for the same genre.  I found them fantastic.  The Boutique is very good. I found beautiful gifts and postcards. Bought 3 art books, of high quality.A must, for art lovers.    Again, this is not about Modern Art or Prehistory."
Turistic ,An impressive collection of russian art. A lot of quality old russian paintings which i wouldn’t knew them if i would passed by the museum without visited it.Worth the visit but you’d better book a guided tour. The guides that we encountered were quite professional and they knew for sure what is really important to view.
Russian impressive art,"interesting exhibition. good explanations with the audio guide, cllasical paints, russion history through the arts which is very impressive"
Well worth the visit,We decided on the Tretyakov because in Russia we wanted to experience Russian Art.  Each room was a delight.  Without the distraction of looking for 'The Monet' or 'The Rembrandt' it was a great pleasure to be able to appreciate a a painting or sculpture for what it meant to you as an individual.  Beautiful.
Place for learning rather than for gazing,Plan at least 3 hours (it will not be enough) for the tour. Guide is absolutely necessary and I would not say that the electronic ones they provide in the lobby are worse than an always running person repeating the same stories unemotionally.
Fine experience with Russian classic art,"We choose to visit the gallery on a rainy day, with no previous information, excepting the well-known name of the gallery. We were very well surprised by many vivid, realistic, bold-coloured classical paintings, linked to Russian landscape, people and historical events. The museum has ""human"" dimensions, so two or three hours are enough for an impression tour, with stops for eye-catching paintings. 500 rubles for an adult ticket were worthwhile."
Russian art from 11th to 20th century,"If you have enough time, extend your visit to a few days since the gallery consists of 60 halls each suggesting a wide and really good selection of Russian art. Auido guide is strongly recommended. Enjoy Schedrin’s city views, Venetsianov’s rural life and Repin’s realism. A real must see."
Your head will explode...,So much to see. We entered expecting a small gallery. Three hours later I left dazed and confused. But it is worth; the quality of their collection is incredible
64 hall of art which forms Russian character,"Basically Vasnetsov is a gateway to Russian fairy tales, he affects how Russians view the world.Shishkin, Levitan  and Aivazovsky shows you how Russians see the nature."
A very good gallery but very very disability unfriendly,"This gallery is packed full of interesting art ranging from brilliant down to poor but it does enable you to see  very good selection of pre-revolutionary art. There is more art than can be seen in one day.The gallery is totally disability unfriendly and I say this from the point of view of pushing someone in a wheelchair. The ticket office is in the basement and there is no lift to get down to it. Or rather there is a stair lift (which you can get to once you have managed to cross the door lintel) but the staff there will not let anyone use it. The same rule applies to all of the stair lifts within the gallery which is spread over a number of floors.Like many places in Moscow, this issue needs sorting out and spoils an otherwise superb gallery"
Simply boring...,"I was not impressed (as a lover of art). It is a bunch of portraits packed together, nothing more. :("
Russian art,This museum was part of out tour and we got to spend a lot of time here.  The are collection is incredible and very diverse... an art lovers dream.
Good museum,A multi floor museum with categorized paintings and art! You got to climb stairs and move around ! Need 2 hours for a good viewing of the art and paintings!
A must visit gallery - nothing like it in the world,"A wonderful and unique gallery which in addition to rate and valuable icons, also houses some of the best examples of Russian paintings from 19th and early 20th century. A really unique experience for anyone who loves paintings and is interested in Russia. The paintings include life-like portraits of important figures (tsars, nobles, generals, writers, musicians), dramatic depictions of famous events in Russian history and Christian religion, wonderful examples of travel art, landscapes and seascapes, allegorical art and art with political messages or connotations. You will enjoy the visit if you appreciate painting at its best and you will leave with a better appreciation of Russia's rich history and culture. Personal favorites include the portraits of Tolstoy, Pushkin, Dostroyefski and Mussorsky, Rypin's picture of Tsar Ivan the Terrible with a hint of regret and madness in his eyes cradling his dying son whom he had executed, Shishkin's landscapes of the Russian countryside, Vereshchagin's Apotheosis of War and other battleground pictures more subtly questioning militarism and war, Surikov's epic paintings of the Streltskys and Boyarina Morozova, the rich and vivid colors of Arkhip Kuindzi's paintings and Serov's impressionist portraits. If you are going with children, you will probably need to cherry pick the paintings you will focus and talk about but you will still have a rich experience over 1-1.5 hours. You can spend a whole morning or afternoon at the gallery if you are without children keen to rush back to their i-pads and i-phones. A couple of bonuses for art lovers - the books published and available with pictures of the paintings are really well done and good value. And you can take pictures without flash - so you can select your own favorites.A definite must visit if you are in Moscow."
State Tretyakov Gallery,This was a really great Art Gallery with all the Russian  Masters.  They sent their artists to Italy to learn how to paint from the Italian masters and shows the evolution  of Russian Art.
Incredible Collection of Russian Art to 1917,"The museum displays key art pieces from the 11th Century to 1917 (all Pre-Revolution).  The diversity, quality and display are excellent.  The range of the art styles during the early modern period is impressive, and clearly Russian artists were in the forefront of the trends and style development.  Take you time to explore, and ignore the audio tour, as it drags you around to only a few pieces."
Can't say enough good things about this place,"We've been living in Moscow for slightly over a year now, and the State Tretyakov Gallery is my favorite gallery in the city. We can easily spend a whole day there without realizing the passing of time. If you're into realism, then this is THE place to be. Great, great collection. We rented an audio guide the first time we went, and it was worth the money. Learned a lot more than we would have, especially about the Marc Chagall pieces. I am also a huge fan of their gift shops. There are several of them within the building, and each one has a different variety of goodies. I love the fact that all the merch here are sold at extremely affordable prices (e.g. 50 rubles or so for a piece of fridge magnet with a headlining painting, and 100 rubles only for a super-high-quality kid's coloring book -- featuring famous paintings in the gallery). Overall, if you're an art-lover, you'll fall in love with this gallery."
Art and artists,Our guide took us to this art and artists gallery and explained to us the historic importance of it.We spent some time there .
Where are the icons?,"This museum is huge and features a vast collection of Russian art spanning over four centuries; however one of the main attractions (at least in my opinion) were the Russian Icons, now confined in 6-8 rooms at the ground floor and at the very end of an endless itinerary (after all they are the main attraction, right?); I have been here many years ago and have very precise recollection of a much bigger section dedicated to the icons. It is true that there has always been a spat between the Russian Orthodox Church and the State which confiscated many icons from historic churches during the communist period and set them for exposition; the tide has changed now and many museums are giving back some of the masterpieces; either that or the museum has changed the exposition by alternating the many pieces of art they have in the basement; whatever the reason, this visit was no match to the one I paid years ago and failed to impress me."
Russian painters exhibition ,"This is Russian national gallery, many pictures of Russian painters describing Russian life some royalty and Russian wars."
Interesting choice of art pieces and artists - poor curating & exhibition set up,"Malevich is one of my favorite artists so having him was a massive plus for me! Even though I am a student I did not get a discount because I am not Russian and when I wanted to buy the catalogue once again I was told I could only get a Russian one. Hence they do not take into consideration International tourists, only Russians. Also there were renovations and to my surprise they had blocked the exit.You had to walk back where you came from which meant  we had to walk 35 rooms back and forth.They did not even let an old couple exit that way! They rudely asked them to go around.Poor customer service in general! They are lucky the content of their exhibition is satisfying."
Heaven for Russian art lovers,"The Tretyakov Gallery is an art wonder. The most important works of the most important Russian artists are displayed here, in a clearly laid out pattern by genre/time frame. I only had a couple of hours to spend, but would have loved to have stayed a couple of days there. Of particularly note for me were the Isaak Levitan paintings in Hall 37 of the Main Building, and the works of Valentin Serov in Hall 41. There were also grandiose Repin paintings on the lower floor that were spectacular. I visited on a Tuesday afternoon and the museum was filled with visitors of all ages, which is always an encouragement. Though it was busy, the traffic flow inside was not problematic."
Fantastic place,"Fantastic place, take a professional guide if you can. There is something for all ages, my daughter is ten , she loved it too."
Visit this Museum,The Museum is so big and so full of European Art that plan to stay there at least four hours if you want to at least have a reasonable idea of all the art that is in that Museum
Loved every moment,"I loved every moment of this museum, this beautiful art was out of this world.  A must see for every artlover."
So much lovely Russian art ,"Went on a Saturday evening, as it opens till 9pm and has fewer people in the evening. A nightmare finding the entrance as there are restoration works going on and there’s no English signage. But persevere and you will be rewarded with wonderful Russian art of all subjects. You only get bilingual names of the painting at the base of the frame, but most rooms have a large explanation card you can borrow to read if you don’t fancy renting an audio guide. We spent a good 2.5 hours there but had to rush through the 1st floor! Wish we had more time."
The Best Museum in Moscow ,"A huge must place for art and history lovers. Tretyakov Gallery has an amazing collection of Russian artists and not only. You will see enormous amount of portraits from ceiling to floor, beautiful landscapes from baroque to modern age. The people in the portraits, from nobles to commoners, seem like “telling” you the history of the country. In the end of the visit you will have the feeling that you know those people and their lifestyle at least in the past. You will be full of emotions, information and satisfaction. Tretyakov Gallery is where I suggest to start exploring the beautiful Russian culture and history."
Russia History through the paints,Even if you are not a professional of the Russian paints and paintersYou should visit it this collectionYou ll discover the Russia history thanks to the creative artists !Really interesting
Great gallery,"Be aware there are like 60 rooms that have large dimensions so get prepared for a full day experience, however is worth it"
Beautiful art museum,The museum has a vast collection of Russian art that is quite impressive but also the building itself is quite beautiful. Unfortunately there are a lot of tourist groups there in summer  that crowd in front of specific paintings.
An absolute must see!!!,"Russian art is unique, beautiful, spiritual, inspired, but tragically not well know outside the country even  by people claiming to be art connoisseurs  . Visiting the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow is a definite must even if you are far from being an art aficionado. The collection of paintings, drawings and sketches presented there is so unique and instrumental to understanding the mysterious workings of a true Russian soul that a trip to Moscow would not be complete without it. If you have a whole day to spend there, you will be rewarded by experiencing so much beauty it will take you days to digest. But even if you only have a few hours, visit it anyway, try to see all the highlights and don't forget to stop by their wonderful cafeteria serving delicious Russian food, and their gift boutiques for various great souvenirs."
Russian Artists,Never saw these great Russian artists in other galleries.  It was extremely impressive and in a beautiful are of Moscow.
Must visit,"I fell completely in love with this gallery.did not know much of Russian painters except for a few.it was a learning experience.its the collection of a single personThe best thing abt this museum are the shops.got lovely very competitive priced souvenirs from here.the staff is most helpful.my sister’s credit card got stuck in the ATM machine, 2 staff members and quickly retrieved it for her.thank you"
Lots of great art...especially that of Russia,"This is listed on almost every travel suggestion for Moscow for good reason.  It contains some of the best Russian art that can be seen, especially the old icons. It is worth getting a guide or other method of knowing about what you are seeing."
Culture of Russia,I was visiting this gallery as an enterpriter for a group of businesmen last year. The most interesting moment of our trip that we found a similar portrait ehich is similar to one of the members of our group. Besides it worth of visiting if u want to see the history of Russia through the paintings.
"For true art lovers, not your average tourist.","A verry impression collection, taking the audio tour is really worth it. it makes the experience so much more interesting."
Fine Russian Fine Arts,"While most Westerners might associate Russia with excelling at the performing arts, many don't realize they have a gorgeous fine arts tradition as well.  The Tretyakov Gallery is the best place to see Russian-centric fine art.  Ticket purchasing was easy despite our limited Russian, and coat check was mandatory as we went in the colder month of late November, which made it much easier to walk around without lugging heavy outerwear with us.  The galleries themselves are well organized and well displayed.  There are also quite a few gorgeous light fixtures throughout the galleries, so don't forget to look up and around the pieces of art.  In addition to their many fine paintings, they have a fantastic collection of Russian Orthodox icons, including the Virgin of Vladimir.  Do not miss catching that."
Amazing collection of historical Russian paintings,"While the State Hermitage in St Petersburg houses more artwork, Tretyakov's dominance in Russian paintings and artpieces are much more impressive. The entire history of Russia can be experienced by visiting this museum."
Must do for a Russian literature buff,This is home to the most famous Russian paintings from the 1800s. Some of these paintings are massive and breathtaking
Tretyakov gallery in Moscow,Hiya. Tretyakov gallery is one of my favourite picture galleries in Moscow city. I love new excursions. The gallery of January 2012 was worth seeing. Recommend to all visitors of City!
Outstanding Collection of Russian Art!,The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow has over 1300 paintings and icons dating from the early 12th century to modern Russian art. This is an exhibit that should not be missed because Westerners know so little about Russian artists and their work which ranks with some of the greatest European artists that we are most familiar with. This is an education for all who are unfamiliar with Russian art.
Very rude staff,I was shocked by the manners of the museum’s staff... long time ago since I had to confront such a rude behavior...
Beautiful paintings,We were amazed by the beauty of the paintings. The museum itself was quiet and comfortable. This museum beat the Pushkin (Moscow) and Russian Museum (Petersburg) in our experience.
Fine Art in the World .....Do not visit if you......,"Full of artist paintings and so much of numbers (years its was painted) and names to be remembered. This is one of the smallest gallery i been (compared with Armoury Chamber in Kremlin or Hermitage in St Petersburg) but... full of paintings to talk about. This is the best collections that brought from everywhere with their own story to share with us. As this is where most fine arts collection in the world are exhibit at 1 building, do not visit if you have intention to steel or wish to damage its ambiance. Please keep quite and lets painting talks to you...."
One Man's Collection and Dream,"This is the largest museum of Russian art from the 11th to 19th century.  The collection contains paintings by Repin, Levintan, Pukirev, etc.  Fantastic and you must spend 2-3 hours here."
Masterpieces- must see,"Excellent collection of Russian masters. Confusing gallery plan - kind of makes you go in a non-chronological order, a bit of a problem with signs... Still, the collection is amazing!"
Pictures from childhood,"If you studied in any post-soviet country, you probably will find your all book illustrations here. A great collection of Russian classical art."
Very good collection,It has an amazing collection of Russian painters. The building itself is worth looking at. Located conveniently in the center of the city.
INCREDIBLE!,"Stunning paintings that do not tour outside of Russia - an important addition to the history of art. Russian art is excluded from Western art history, so it is important to see these paintings at the Tretyakov."
The home of Russian Art,"Nice facility covering the whole spectrum of Russian art through the 20 century.  Lots of excellent paintings, although art history programs in the US certainly do not emphasize Russian art.  Like a lot of museums in Russia I wish there would be a great emphasis on English in order to assist visitors from outside the Russian Federation to learn more easily about the country’s history."
A must see! ,This art gallery is one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The experience was overwhelmingly beautiful. One must have a whole day to fully experience the beauty of this place.
Fabulous collection,"If you enjoy history thru art, this museum is like having dessert. More pieces than you can possibly see in an entire afternoon, and each one grander than the next. Photos allowed."
A nice gallery,"It was a little difficult to find the entrance, however we did eventually make it and weren't disappointed by our efforts. Lovely art works"
It’s a Must! ,I would highly recommend to take a guided tour. It takes 5h to see the whole exhibition so better to come before afternoon.
Great Russian Art,This is a large art museum filled with Russian Art from various ages up to early 20th century.  Well worth your time and easily accessed from Metro.  As a bonus there is a square outside of the Metro that offers several places for a meal including McDonalds.  The museum is a lot bigger than it looks and offers a comprehensive history of Russian Art.  We had a guided tour and I would highly recommend getting one - as the guides are passionate about the gallery and bring the paintings to life.  Worth the time and effort.
One of the world's best!,"Yes, this is a must-see - and bring a guide! Each piece of the hundreds of pieces of art has a story, one you'll never forget!"
Impressive,I don't study art or have any kind of artistic talent but art is such a great way to see history through the eyes of others.This gallery was no different. I was hoping for a bigger exhibit but was happy with the variety. Only Russian artist I knew was kandinsky and they only had one piece.I paid 500 rubles[$8usd]...totally worth it but most paintings not on audio which made it hard not reading Russian.Totally enjoyed my time and would reccomend it.
A Must See,"This is a museum of Russian artists and it is fantastic. Living in the ""West"" we hear little about and know little about Russian artists except for the great of the great. To see these artists and recognize the different schools of painting is amazing. There were many great artists of Russia that rival those we know of. It is a quick. Metro ride from Red Square and the neighborhood is quite pleasant as well. Arrive early as it is very busy and the line to enter is always long. We arrived when it first opened and had to wait 20 minutes to get in and when we left over three hours later the line was just as long. We know why and after you go, you will as well."
Amazing ,A must!!! Take a guide to visit!!! Also the park is a great place to stroll around!!! I think you should include it in your travel plans
The icons at this Gallery are utterly mindblowing,"If you like icons, this is the place.  Rooms of them and the colours are superb.  I would have spent every afternoon just looking at them if I could.  Even my husband, who is not into art, thought they were out of this world and loved them.  If you are not convinced about going here then look up online to see the treasures they have.   These icons of the saints were ceiling high and the most superb colours."
Beautiful art,This is a beautiful gallery with beautiful art. Enjoyable visit. We took the audio guide in English. Recommended!
Russian art,Wonderful collection of Russian art. Starting with icons and progressing through time. A lesson in history and culture.
Must visit!,"This Gallery is a must-see place in Moscow! Lots of famous pieces of art! Would recommend after visiting the gallery walk a little around the area and stop by Dream restaurant (em, Meshta or Mechta, not sure)  its a 10-minute walk from the gallery, but a very nice interior and delicious fish and desserts!"
Great art,Several floors of art to review. They had an English translation guide available. Several gift shops
Impressive art museum.,"For those who love Musee D’Orsay or other major art galleries and museums this one is a highly recommended visit. Unfortunately many Russian artists are not famous as the French Impressionists, but you will be surprised with the magnificent paintings you will find there. Besides you will find the original of the most famous Holy Trinity, which is just amazing."
"Epic collection, very tasty food--a great plus!","Yes, this is an engrossing museum. One of the best in the world.  The recent attack suffered by Ilya Repin's ""Ivan the Terrible killing his son"" demonstrates the political and cultural power that many of these works exude. The CAFE is excellent. Very tasty, home-style Russian food.  Take advantage of the delicious, economically priced food, and make a day of it."
The Best Paintings in Russia,"If you like art, then this is the place to go. This gallery houses some of Russia's and the World's greatest pieces. Unfortunately, Russia's greatest masterpiece, Repin's ""Ivan the Terrible killing his son"" has been damaged and is currently unavailable. But don't fret, this places houses so many paintings and national treasures it is a must go to on any trip."
"Russian artists, old and new buildings","Impressive collection of Russian artists. Some rooms have laminated sheets with background information on the primary artist displayed in the room in English. Which was extremely helpful. most of the staff did not speak english, so we did not realize until after we bought our tickets that much of the museum was closed for renovations and that the 20th century art was in an entirely different building. I never did figure out if the new building required an additional ticket."
One of the best in the world,"I'd never have thought a gallery of only Russian art could contain so many beautiful paintings and icons.  I discovered many new favourites and was grateful to see some stunning icons, in particular Rublev's Trinity. A must see gallery in Russia.  Good cafeteria attached, several gift/book shops.  Not too crowded going through and some seats along the way to rest and admire the art work (although a few more wouldn't have gone astray)."
Amazing Part of the Russian Art,"Whenever I visit Moscow, I try to visit the Gallery and enjoy the Russian Artists again and again. One of my favorites ones is Zinaida Serebryakova. Her style of painting is very elegant and precise. The colors, which she used, give her paintings a lot of light and a sparkling."
Booking tickets in advance,"The collection of Russian art needs no further reviews - it is absolutely magnificent. This is advice about booking your tickets. You can do so in advance on the internet, which works quite smoothly, and is to be recommended as the entrance can get quite busy. When you have your vouchers you have to exchange your vouchers for tickets at the cash desk (Kassa). BE WARNED this is in the basement (there are signs directing you there) and is a completely unmarked hole in the wall with two ladies with cash registers. Once you realise that this is the cash desk, then everything is really easy, but it took me ten minutes to find it!"
"Majestic art, dated facilities ","Lots of Russian historical art, interesting pieces. However the gallery itself is somewhat dated. Worth a visit if you are interested to see some historical paintings"
Impressive,A real overview of the Imperial families and their wealth - from Crown Jewels to coronation dresses to Faberge eggs
An eye opener,"The Tretyakov gallery is a real treat , packed with wonderful Russian artworks portraying daily scenes , political thrillers , the life of Jesus and the saints , as well as iconography , pottery and sculpture. A journey through time from the fifteenth to twentieth centuries . A lot to take in , and you do need a guide to explain things clearly- everything is in Russian , and a lot of the subject matter needs explaining . Loved it . Need to allow quite a bit of time to process it all"
A must see,"A must see once in a life, if you are interested in art. Unique and breathtaking paintings and portraits, that could define art taste of Russia. I strongly recommend to visit if you have time more than half day."
Nice exhibition of Russian painters,It is not Louvre. It is much smaller museum. You can probably walk it all in a couple of hours. It has the best collection of Russian painters and that is what makes it unique.
One of must have place in Moscow,One of the important gallery in Russia. Big and very beautiful collection of Russian art. Must have!
Very high quality gallery great Russian painters,We really enjoyed Tretyakov as the quality of paintings was superb and a great many Russian artists that don't otherwise feature prominently A lovely laid out gallery and should be on your must see list for Moscow
Russian art at its best,"If you are in Moscow, make sure you spare some 3-4 hours to visit one of the most famous museums in RUSSIA. Here you will find all the major works of art from 17th century onwards. It is impressive to see how paintings speak for the whole historical context, not mention that you learn a lot about the historical context and traditions. You'll also find the two most famous paintings.  Make sure you have good shoes, because it is huge. Backpacks are not allowed inside, so make sure you leave your belongings downstairs in the cloakroom. Purses are allowed. The line to get in is always big, but that's because you have to through security, and if you know Russian customer service.... it sucks! not the fastest :) - there are to buildings: my suggestion: buy a combo ticket, if you are planning on spending the whole day, or do one building one day and the other one on the following day, so that you have some time to take it all in. Have fun!"
Amazing Gallery,I have never been see such a best collection of art in the one place. It worth visit to many times and find every time new.
Finally saw all Russian masterpieces!,I’ve been to Moscow many times but never visited this gallery before . I absolutely enjoyed it! Growing up in Russia I remember seeing all these famous paintings in text books. I was so happy finally being able to see them live! Great masterpiece of Russian art. It’s worth booking tickets on line as you will skip the queue especially on the weekend. Kids are free but still require a ticket
Russian art history,"It is a great place! When you come here you forget about all your problems and get a real pleasure from contemplating the beautiful. You can find here paintings of great Russian masters, like Vasnetsov, Repin, Shishkin, Ayvazovskiy and etc. In addition to paintings, gallery have a several hall with icons and sculptures.This museum is a greatest monument of russian art  and one of the best museum in Russia. If you like art, this place a must see!And finally, I recommend find minimum 4 hours for visit this gallery.When i will come to Moskow for next time, I`ll definitely  go here again!"
A must see museum,Amazing paintings to understand Russian history and character. Roerich paintings are awesome.Count about 2-3h to see everything!
Best pictures form the golden era of Russia.,It the gallery is remarkable collection of pictures form the golden era of Russian painting art. Mr Tretyakov had made a great step for the next generations. Interesting and educating museum.
"Amazing collection, a must visit museum in Moscow","A must visit museum in Moscow. If you have only one day to dedicate to museums, I think it would be the best choice to meet the greatest variety of Russian art. The museum is huge, but is very easy to orientate. All halls are numbered and present art from a particular period, starting form 18 century, and progressing to 20th. Take a map, and follow the numbers. The museum can take all day if you want to see in detail all its collection. Since I am not an admirer of portraits of royalties, interesting art for me starts from second half of 19 century. So I ran fast through the first 15 halls, and slowed down at hall 16, where art began to develop towards impressionism. Don't miss sea scenery by Ayvazovski, countryside and forests by Repin, Shishkin etc. From this point, each hall leads to more modern, captivating art. Make sure you have enough time to get to hall 32 with Vrubel. His work is mesmerizing and emotional, I could not take my eyes of his Demon for long minutes..."
Time for art,"This art museum can be interesting for everyone. It has very fine pieces of art, some of which are very impressive. Also it has nice and not expensive cafe if you get hungry."
Typical art museum ,It is full of all Russian art and artist. It was worth the 2.5 hours it tookTo go through it. Old museum but well cared for.
Marvellous experience with Russian Fine Art,"As I Russian, I always wanted to visit the State Tretyakov Gallery to take a look at all the masterpieces I was learning about at school. I have been to the gallery for 5 or 6 times so far, and every single time I had something new to discover (a new pearl, if you please).  It is worth your time and money, so please folks do not miss this brilliant opportunity and plunge into the Fine Art of Russia. I suggest visiting the main branch of the Gallery in Lavrushinsky lane (the second one at Krimsky Val has the Modern Art only)"
Excellent look back at Russias history,We spent 2.5 hrs in the gallery guided by Svetlana Shubina and it was invaluable having her at our disposal . Her knowledge and passion for Russian history brought the gallery to life !  Some incredible treasures in this Gallery that can't be seen anywhere else ! A must see
Outstanding  Museum.,"We visited this Museum by alighting at Tretyakovskaya metro station on orange line after changing at Novokuznetskaya station on green line. This is outstanding museum housing world's best collection of Russian icons and pre-revolutionary art. There are many sections in different floors and thanks to audio guide I could prioritize the best displayed pieces to see. One needs at least four hours to explore the beautiful collection in the museum. A must for the travellers interested in art,  paintings and historical past of Russia.Photography without using flash is allowed and there is admission ticket plus additional charges for audio guide."
Not good for English speakers,"We got an audioguide in English, but it turned out that not that many pieces got an explanation in English and those that did... well, it was rather poor. Which is a shame because the local art is stunning - but you're not really getting context for it. There were rooms where not a single art piece was translated/ marked in English, not to mention being explained in the audioguide. Discouraging."
Vacation,The museum is small and has interesting art. Was once a home to Tretyakov and his personal art that he donated to make a museum. One can imagine what a ‘residence’ this must have been.
"Nice exhibits, but some poor lighting","Russian artists. Very good collection, but some rooms were poorly lighted and it was difficult to see some works because of the glare."
Worth a visit,"Very interesting collection. I believe everyone can find something different to their liking. My favourite definitely was A.Rublev Icon paintings. Its easy to get there, in ticket office they do speak English and souvenir shop offers decent pricing. Only downgrade for this gallery is security guys. Made us feel very unwelcome, would be arrogantly rude if we asked for directions and they were acting like they own the place and made. Very unpleasant feeling to be honest. Those security guards would suit more prison guard jobs rather than fine art premises."
Excellent visit,"I think that was one of my best experience in Moscow. Although you need plenty of time in order to be able to see the whole gallery, the paintings of the Russian history was amazing. Next time I have to go again and finish it up!"
Russian Masters,"A great gallery to view great pre-revolutionary works by Russian masters, most of whom are unknown or unheralded outside of their homelands."
The Real Russia,"Comparisons of St Petersburg and Moscow have contrasted the broad boulevards of the former with the winding lanes of the latter. The unusual exterior of the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow gives a hint of what the capital must have been like during the 1860s. So that is one reason to visit. Another prominent Moscow gallery's USP is its collection of impressionists but if time is limited surely you don't need to go to Moscow to see these paintings. So another reason to go to the Tretyakov is to see the paintings by Russian artists who have been little known outside Russia. This collection, assembled by a benefactor who had superb taste and cared for the longer view is outstanding. The visitor will also appreciate the workings of a major Russian institution committed to making art available to Muscovites and to tourists, a third reason to visit. A fourth is the shop where excellent reproductions of the art on show, not available elsewhere, can be bought for not much money."
Wonderful museum in all aspects.,We had been encouraged by friends who had been here and we were pleased to have made the stop. The variety of art and the presentations are first class.  Pavel Tretyakov had collected the finest of Russian art and turned it over to the government.  The iconography is quite interesting and the set up of the museum allows for easy access and understanding.
This is the major collection of Russian art - from medieval painted icons through to contemporary Russian art,"This is one of great art galleries of the world, divided between two venues - art up to the revolution at Lavrushinskiy Lane and the Russian avant-garde through to contemporary Russian art at Krimskiy Val.  These are huge modern galleries with thousands of well-labelled exhibits.  An absolute treasure house!"
Huuuge,A day is clearly not enough for to see the entire collection. Just too much to see and  you don't want to miss one for the other. Its such a pity how mainland european art collections are talked up when too few people know about what the Russian museums in Moscow and st. Petersburg are stashed with. For art lovers this is like being let loose in a chocolate factory. Amazing! The souvenir shop in the end is also very interesting a nd must not be missed though the winter palace goes a step ahead.
My personal favourite,"The best place in Moscow to admire the works of the Russian painters. There are some amazing pictures to find here like Princess Tarakanova, Boyaryna Morozova or Ivan the Terrible killing his son. A must-see!"
Prepare to be amazed,"A wonderfully extensive collection!  Spend a little time and be awed, spend a half day with audiophones or sign up for highlight tours or specific themes.  Cafe and restaurant in addition to lovely souvenirs and postcards.  We were with a guide who did the highlights but we could easily come back for more.  Charming to see school children in classes sitting on the floor with their teachers instructing them at length about certain artists and eras."
Amazing collection,Stunning collection of Russian paintings (& some sculpture). We arrived in the evening which was good in terms of there not being too many people but bad in terms of feeling a bit rushed as the collection is quite amazing and would benefit from repeated visits. don't miss it.
spend the whole day to explore the best collection of Russian art in the world,"We visited the gallery in early January 2018 and spent about five hours to explore the main exhibition and I think it really is the best collection of Russian art in the world. We rented the ""audio guide"" device and it was very helpful. Keep in mind that it will take some time to stand in line to get into the gallery, so better come in the morning to the gallery opening."
Really big,"Amazing display. Historical figures and landscapes particularly interesting. There is so much art and a long route through the gallery, so make sure you have enough time. There is a reasonably priced cafe and entrance is 500r."
I think I could have been sitting there for days and watched some of them.,"It has been some years since we visited The State Tretyakov Gallery first time. At that visit we just saw some of the main paintings of the gallery. However we wanted to take a longer walk and see all what the gallery could show us.You get amazed of all the fantastic Russian paintings present in the gallery.I think I could have been sitting there for days and watched some of them. The gallery is very central located in Moscow and easy to get to either you walk from Red Square or need to take the Metro. It is recommended to be early, special in the weekend as my experience passing by many of the museums round about in Moscow have long lines after 14.00 so the locals are a bit later heading for the cultural activity. We were there at midday and perfect timing."
Tretyakov Gallery,Brilliant Gallery to visit! One actually needs a full day. That is if you have an interest in art. Go and see it!
THE BEST.,"Worth visiting especially if you love arts and history and this gallery itself has a great history behind it.This gallery is really really huge, and is situated in a nice explorable area so you might want to put on your most comfortable pair of shoes and do not come here hungry."
Enjoyed it!,"Must visit place! Take your time and see all the paintings, take the audio guide! Emotional and spiritual uplift guaranteed!"
Many things to see,"Loved the things we saw, but disappointed that it was so crowded we could virtually not move.  Many tourist were extremely rude.  We were told this is common"
Wear comfortable shoes,"If you like art then this is the place for you, lots of artifacts and more paintings than you can imagine.  You can spend a good morning/afternoon here and still miss out on a gallery or two. Very enjoyable.  When finished there's a great cafe next door too."
Absolute must for tourists,"If you are visiting Moscow and want to see one of the best collections of Russian art it is the place to come. It is one of the largest museums in Russia with more than 100 000 works of art (paintings, sculpture etc.). Here you will find ""Trinity"" by Andrey Rublov, ""The girl with peaches"" by Valentin Serov, Bogatyrs by Victor Vasnetsov and many others. Museum's building is itself a work of art and was designed by famous russian painter Viktor Vasnetsov."
Very good place to experience/learn about Russian art,I went on my own and took an English voice/guide self tour. Very good explanation and easy to operate.
Great gallery of Russian religious historical art,"Tretyakov is a wonderful gallery and a must visit in Moscow. Beginning with historic icons, you walk-through galleriesshowing the evolution of art in Russia and through this much of Russia's history. Too many wonderful works to list here but a visit to the adjoining church of St Nicholas to view theistic icon, The Virgin of Vladimir should not be missed."
Biggest collection of Russian art,I enjoyed this collection so much! I didn't know much about Russian art but the paintings are amazing and so worth to see.
Russian art,"This is a great gallery full of Russian art, icons, sculptures allow yourself plenty of time to wonder the exhibits."
Great For Art Lovers,"Full Disclosure: I’m a philistine. I’m not your art guy. I’m a foreign language, history, literature guy. When it comes to art, I never got past the paint by numbers stage. The gallery is historic and beautiful. It’s located in an old section of Moscow that wasn’t fully razed by Stalin in the 1930’s. It’s worth a day if for nothing else than to just wander aroundRegarding the art, my Russian wife and my American mother loved the place. Me?  I take a book and read while my wife goes to look at the paintings. She gives it “two thumbs up” so there you go"
A must see!,The Tretyakof Gallery is perhaps the most comprehensive collection of Russin painting and more!You need more than a full morning to see all the items but in a rush because there are many exhibits worth seeing.I would suggest to visit the gallery in two days in order to be able to appreciate all of it.
One of the best Russian museums,"One of the biggest collection of Russian art. Just a few tips: (1) don't come to an opening hour (be late for at least 30 mins) or you will be ought to stay in a long que. (2) on the ground floor there is a decent canteen, part of the Bratiya Tretiyakovi restaurant, but far more affordable. (3) buy tickets online."
Symbolic and mythic museum,"One of the best world museums with Russian artists - from middle age icons to XXth century pre-impressionnists. A great place to visit and to discover a part of the Russian culture. Most impressive collection, especially icons section."
great place to get an overview about Russian art,"great museum, great collection, not so dark, a bit crowded. cafeteria was very oldschool and not very friendly but we got what we wanted. located on the ground floor"
Must have!,"Realy grate art. The honor of Russia.It can be the queue in front of cashier, sometimes better to buy ticket by internet.Better to take excursion with gide. It is forbidden to go with backpack, you should stay it in baggage storage. Difficult but stright navigation. You better to have at least 3 hours to go there. There are a lot of restorants and caffe around, close streets. If you need help, ask young people, they usually speak english."
The treasure chest of Russia,"The Gallery and the Hermitage in St Petersburg -here are two treasure chests of Russian art, your must see in Russia."
Art Gallery in Moscow filled of Russian artists,"Tretyakov gallery is one of the most recommended Art Gallery in Moscow filled of Russian artists.The tour starts from the first floor with a lot of styles of paintings, Gogol, Tolstoj, Puskin, “Three heroes” , “The Apparition of Christ to the people "".. make Russians proud; historically important, but with questionable artistic value.Contrary, the ground floor is completely dedicated to Russian icons, this is the most important collection of Russian icons in the whole country for quality and quantity.The cost of the ticket is 500 rubles, plus 500 rubles for the audio guide (350 rubles for Russian audio guide). The main exhibits took me 2/3 hoursThe staff inside the museum don`t speak English, it's a shame. is one of the most recommended art galleries in Moscow filled of Russian artists.The tour starts from the first floor with a lot of styles of paintings, Gogol, Tolstoj, Puskin, “Three heroes” , “The Apparition of Christ to the people "".. make Russians proud; historically important, but with questionable artistic value.Contrary, the ground floor is completely dedicated to Russian icons, this is the most important collection of Russian icons in the whole country for quality and quantity.The cost of the ticket is 500 rubles, plus 500 rubles for the audio guide (350 rubles for Russian audio guide).

A Museum Not To Miss,"The Tretyakov Gallery is a great museum you shouldn't miss while in Moscow. I had a great time there with one of my friends. It wasn't too busy when we went. Not as busy as the Louvre, for example. We had a funny experience. We wanted to get an audio guide in English (we don't speak any Russian) and found out that the lady who was in charge of the English audio guides couldn't speak any English. And that's not all! When I tried to talk to her in English, she became angry and talked back in Russian. I couldn't understand anything. The only thing we managed to figure out is that she was pissed off. The museum is amongst the best in the world. Why don't they hire someone who can speak English to deal with foreign tourists, obviously numerous in this part of town?"
A must for lovers of art,"For us this was a sheer bonus, Initially we had no plans to go here but at the last minute we decided to go.It was an incredible collection of Russian paintings. Many of us were not familiar with the names of the Russian painters but we loved the paintings on display"
Incredible collection,"The Tretyakov has two galleries. The new one is by the river opposite Gorky Park while the older is a little more difficult to find.The new offers a fabulous collection of ""modern "" Russian art while the older has literally dozens of masterpieces. Both are well worth the admission fee"
loved even by a non-museum person,it seems like the minute I enter a museum my feet start to hurt from standing and I lose interest in the art in front of me. Even entering late in the day of sightseeing I stayed much longer than expected due to the amount of realism presented. The art is amazing and the stories of the past seem to come alive room to room painting to painting.
First visit,Large art collection of Russian painters. Best to book a guide that can share more details and background
Less know treasure trove,"What to say only that it took my breath away.I spent 7hrs in the gallery and it passed in the blink of the eye!I didn't mind 2h wait to enter on -19c , it was well worth it!"
Big,This is a very large museum! We found a large part not to our tastes but the part we did enjoy was great. The art covers so many periods that you will find something to see. One room in particular really fascinated us. See the photos.
Fourth visit; not disappointed,"Over the years, I've visited the Gallery four times. This time was as enjoyable as all the others. Not only did I enjoy the exhibits, but the  cafe is quite nice. Simple offering, good seating, quick service."
Out of the way,"This gallery goes on and on.  A good guide is essential as there is so much to see, room follows room of interesting Russian art from over the centuries."
Such a huge art collection. Must visit for art buffs,"This place has over 1,000 pieces or artwork, ancient art, sculptures and many more that can amaze you for hours and hours."
Huge Art Gallery,"This is a huge art gallery filled with Russian artworks from the 11th through the 20th century.  Although I was unfamiliar with most of the artists, many of the paintings seemed to be of high quality.  Many were large.  I skipped the icons."
Tremendous collection,"Well worth a nice visit, this museum contains a wonderful historic collection of Russian art. Take your time and feast on this collection."
Essential,An absolute must for art lovers of all genres. Well laid out and excellent books available for purchase.
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,Loved this museum/gallery.  A 'must' for art lovers traveling to Moscow.  Could spend 2 days rather than 5 hours.
Great Moscow gallery,I like this gallery. I have been there several times. The permanent exibition is wonderful! I adore especially landscapes of the great painter Shishkin.I advice visiting this place to all art lovers.
Russian Art!,"We were fortunate to have a very knowledgeable tour guide who took us through the museum  Although it is not as popular as the Hermitage and larger museums of Russia, it is best to arrive early when it opens to see the works up close and personal and to avoid the crowds."
So Much Art To See,"we didn't have long in Moscow, but really wanted to visit this gallery.  it has many masterpieces worth seeing, and they were displayed very well."
If you are not into the Russia art & short of time go to the Pushkin's museum Mordern Art Gallery instead,"Offers the great collection of Masterpieces of Russian art of the 11th - early 20th century. If you are Russian or into Russian history and Art, you must go & will enormously enjoy the visit. However, if you are on the short visit better check the Pushkin's museum Gallery of 19-20 century European and American art. One of the world's best collection includes Claude Monet, August Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Andre Derain and Menri Rousseau."
TLIG tour,"An entrance shadowed by a huge statue of Tretynakov looking across the road, three gates so beautiful.We did not go inside the gallery but the impression of the gates indicates historic items inside."
A definite visit for art lovers,Russian art on view.  What stood out for me were the Ikons -- beautiful color and design.  So glad they have a large collection available to the public
Trip to Moscow with friends,"Beautiful and interesting art collection.One of the places you can not miss if you go to Moscow. Important to read before a little bit about the russian story, and also good idea if you can have a guided visit"
Fascinating Journey Through Russian pre Revolutionary Art,"This gallery is brilliant! Spacious and attractive lobby with good shops. The Icon section is great and then you go through the rooms tracing the history of Russian art. Some great paintings in every section - always something to catch your eye. We took a guided tour for 4 hours and, although this was quite tiring, I don't think you would get half as much out of it if you went round on your own. If you are at all interested in art this is a must-visit."
Highly recommended,Some incredible works of art and great intro to a wide range of Russian artists. Take a couple of hours to wander round and enjoy. Easy to navigate. In many rooms you'll find laminated sheets in both Russian and English explaining what you're looking at. I'm sure the audio tour is well worth taking but I'd been here 20 years ago and knew which artists I wanted to revisit so didn't bother this time. Easy walk back to centre of Moscow over the river. When you exit the gallery turn left and you'll see the Kremlin.
Leaning about Russian Art,This gallery is housed in the beautiful old building and has great paintings done by Russian artists. We enjoyed seeing so many beautiful paintings and learning about Russian artists.  We were glad that we visited this museum.
"The Russian ""Uffizi""",I strongly recommend a visit to this breathtaking gallery if you want to discover the masterpieces of Russian art. I loved it and thanks to this visit I discovered how great and original are Russian painters. Do not miss it!
Art Junkies Only,This gallery will provide a great education into Russian artists and therby their history.  It also has a large amount of ancient icons from churches all over the country. Get the audio guide to help you through.
Tour group visit to Moscow ,The art work is beautifully displayed - well worth a visit but I would recommend a guide who can highlight specific art works as there is a lot to see.
Interesting for one visit,"Definitely worth a visit, though I wouldn't personally bother going twice. The audio guide is worth getting as it's cheap, but is very superficial and doesn't even have a track about the portrait of Gogol (very strange). Some beautiful pieces, and very interesting to see a collection of solely Russian art."
Worth a visit!!! ,"A very big gallery museum, they have great collections! Count about 3 hours to spend inside. The young kids won't get bored because they have many things to see. It's children friendly place."
To learn more about the great Russian masters of the brush,"Six months later we were able to enter the famous Tretyakov gallery. We bought online tickets. The disappointment at the entrance was huge - there is no separate entrance for online tickets like other world-renowned museums. Sunday, 400 people are waiting outside and luggage check is very, very slow. This is a big problem for the management of this gallery. On top of all, the nasty message was in Russian only, and the haughty security guard was acting as a world policeman.When we passed the first 'test', we were already set to swallow the great beauty gathered in this place. A great impression was made by the hall with Shishkin's paintings. The spectacular composition of Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov 'The Appearance of Christ Before the People' is fascinating. Unfortunately, the hall of the great Ilya Repin was closed and only one picture was exposed - The Religious Procession in Kursk Gubernia.Do not hesitate, Tretyakov gallery is wonderful!"
Beautiful ,"Don't think of missing it!Thousand of very impressive pictures and more solvent gifted Russian artist who created view like in real time, portraits sculptures and more, very much interesting pity that those artists are not very famous all over the world"
A prestigious collection of russian art,"This huge museum offers an impressive group of russian chefs -d'oeuvre belonging to very different historical periods and typologies: from beautiful icons to nineteenth-century paintings. Many illustrious figures of russian political and cultural life such as sovereigns( in particular the empress Catherine the Great) and artists ( Tolstoy and Dostoevsky above all..) are depicted  in some very penetrating portraits. Be careful: access times can be incredibly long, so if you want to visit it during the stiff russian winter bring something hot to drink and be patient!"
One of the must see museums in the world,"Take 2-3 hours to walk through this gallery in a slow pace and see your favorite masterpieces.If season allows, walk towards the new Tretyakov gallery as well, along the river."
The Icons are overwhelming,"There is so much to see in the Gallery that it is hard to leave each room full of wonderful art. The Icons are special, and when we were there hardly any other visitors were in that part of the Gallery. We were so lucky to be able to spend time just looking."
You don't want to miss this,"This gallery has an extensive collections of paintings and icons by Russian artists. Although the audio guide is a bit expensive 500 R, you need a short description of the artist and the context associated with a painting to fully appreciate the art piece. The free map, provided in a number of different languages, lists out some pieces to represent different periods in Russian history. I suggest at least 3+ hours to get a glimpse of the gallery."
Russian art collection,"Allow 2-3 hours for a visit and you will see the fantastic collection of art from a comprehensive list of famous Russian artists.  Art in all forms, mainly paintings. Breathtaking."
This is an outstanding art gallery in the heart of Moscow and a must see.,The founder of this museum collected art from all over Russia with the idea that everyone should be able to see art for free. Although they do charge a fee now it is well worth it to see the wonderful works by the then unknown artists of Russia. Some studied styles of the masters and some were creatively independent. But the museum is absolutely wonderful
Must see!,"All the cities have the places ""mast see"". This museum with very reach collection such kind of ""must see"" even if you come for couple days to Moscow."
Weekend in Moscow,A must for art lovers! At RR 500 per person this was well worth it. The portraits are really special and very lifelike! Rare ally high quality and you can spend a great deal of time inside just taking in some of the best art i the world!
Really worthwile,A bit out of the centre but still doable on foot. A real discovery of Russian painters. Lovely and interesting.
need a full day to see everithing,"If you are interested in art, you will easily spend a day in the gallery. Expedition covers Orthodox Icons, Sculptures and Russian masters from different periods and styles"
Wonderfull Tretyakov Gallery!,"Full of majestic paintings, for me this has been the best I have ever visited. Before, I thought the Tate was number one. In one room I had the distinct pleasure at gazing at the works of Alexei  Venetzianov. Not to be missed!"
Overview of Russian art,"A beautiful and thorough overview of Russian art in all forms, including paintings, sculptures, graphics, icons and photographs. Taking photos is allowed. There was also a nice temporary exhibition of Pavel Kaplevich in the front with mixed media watched from beanbags ."
An impressive art collection,"The gallery has a complete and very well organized collection of Russian paintings, from the icons of the middle ages to the pre-revolutionary artists. The beauty of the paintings is not the only thing that makes it unique, but also the history behind each one of them that will teach you a lot of Russian culture."
Immersed in 🇷🇺 art,"This gallery is huge so prepare yourself: count at least 3 hours for just a quick insight to the classical Russian painting. I ❤ almost every form of art but can't declare myself as an expert of Classical period and especially not of this area. However, the information boards and sheets are perfect, they helped me to understand what I'm watching and this is how a museum should work. As I remember, I had to pay full price because they didn't accepted my student card, but still worth it."
Tretyakov Gallery,"This Gallery houses some of the foremost examples of pre-revolutionary Russian fine art in the world. There are 170,000 exhibits within the museum including works by Andrei Rublev and Kazimir Malevich."
The Surprise Gallery,"Having studied Russian, I knew a little of the art history but this place blew us away.  The Russian realist, Repin and friends were all there. Some standouts were Savrasov's View of the Kremlin in Bad Weather and Nesterov's Archbishop Antony as well as The Troika.  If you want to know what life was like across the broad range of Russian society under the Tsars, the main gallery is the place.  We didn't visit the other galleries with Socialist Realism but heard that is as impressive.  If you have more than a few days in Russia, put this place on your list."
Very very nice,"Don't miss the Gallery while in Moscow if you like, or not, the Russian art. It's really nice! I would recommend you to buy an audio guide cause is very useful. Allow yourself around 4h to visit it."
Go on a friday evening!,Wonderful paintings - well worth seeing. It is open late on Friday evenings (and either Thurs or Sat too). We went on the Friday evening and walked straight in.
Hungry for art ,"If you are in Moscow, and hungry for art, Tretykovka is the place to visit, you won't leave unsatisfied.  Be careful, if you are with small children, they are not stroller friendly, you would have to carry it yourself or ask for help from visitors."
