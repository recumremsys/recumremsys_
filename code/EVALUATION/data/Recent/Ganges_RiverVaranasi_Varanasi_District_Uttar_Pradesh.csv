trivet sangam,"as a result of the lockdown, the river is quite clean. you can easily hire a boat to take a dip in the holy confluence."
"Peaceful, soothing experience, Must Visit",You will find your true happiness sitting on the ghats of Ganges river. Soothing and mind blowing experience. Must visit esp for those who come to see culture and tradition of Varanasi.
"Took an AM & PM river ""cruise""","We had about 48 hours Varanasi and managed to squeeze in 2 river cruises one in the evening and one the following morning.  Both were quite different and both quite interesting. And if I had to pick just one, it would be a toss up as to which I preferred.  The evening ride was more educational, while the morning ride was more peaceful. The evening ride: the process of finding our boat was little difficult and out guide knew who he was looking for!  Once finding our boat, we amazing maneuvered through a sea of parked boats and made our way down the river.  The evening ride seemed to focus on the shoreline crematoriums and while interesting a bit sad for someone not accustomed to seeing it.  IT was a cloudy night so sadly no sunset, but I imagine if the conditions are right that would be beautiful.The AM ride:  It started out alot more smoothly, we found our boat pretty easily.  But the river was MUCH more crowded.  And sadly once again it was cloudy so we did not get much of a sunrise.  I'm not sure you can set up a cruise on your own but be careful there were alot of people coming up to us on the shores of the river asking us if we needed a boat, it seems like an easy way to be take advantage of.  We were there in March and while th weather did not call for it we all wound bringing and needing a little lite jacket or sweater as it gets cool at night and started out cook in the morning."
Once in a lifetime experience,"Came here for sunset ceremony and it was crowded, it was interesting.Next morning woke up early and hopped on a quick boat ride along the river. Great experience if you are in India!"
Amazing atmosphere and colours.,We stayed in the Brijrama Palace hotel and had a river view room.  It is said the river provides the life of the city and we experienced how the Ganges supports the community through out the 24 hour day as local people and visitors went about their daily business.The river is very clean and is relatively wide at this point.  Colour is everywhere.We watched the Aarti ceremony one evening and also took an early morning boat ride to experience the sunrise and the city coming to life.  The calm and relaxed atmosphere was the complete opposite to the highly charged atmosphere of the Aarti ceremony.  You have to see it and you have to take a boat ride.
Sacred Ganga Maa,"Ganves River, the Holy Ganga Maa, attracts crowds of people, from devotees to curious tourists. It's wonderful to sit in some quiet place and simply observe the Holy river and the locals activities there. Amazing!"
Holy River of the Hindu Faith,The Ganges ( and a boat ride on it) are a must for any toursit visiting Varanasi. The crowds of pilgrims coming to visit and the burning ghats where a devout Hindu hopes to be cremated on the banks of the river make it exciting and chaotic.Getting there in a comination of car and walking in the early evenig was indeed a little chaotic and the time on the river was most interesting.
Amazing Ganges ,We liked the way of worship of Ganges and the evening View. A small trip on boat was amazing. We loved that......
A must attend experience ,This was my second visit Varanasi and this place would remain my favourite. A lifeline of Varanasi and hub of all activities this is. Everyone must enjoy boat ride at least one in a lifetime here.
The No.1 thing to do in Varanasi,"My wife and I travelled to Varanasi on a 3 week guided tour of India. Included in our tour, was an evening cruise and followed up the next day, with an early morning cruise and walk along the river. In hindsight, this made our whole journey to India worthwhile. The two journeys in old wooden boats were engaging, exciting, challenging, motivating and generally mesmerizing. The view of funeral fires on the shoreline both night and day, the mourners washing themselves in the brown waters, the wood cutters providing fuel for the fires, the donkeys doing the hauling work, the cows that wander around through the crowds, the scores of monkeys swinging on the bamboo scaffolding on the building sites, the coloured washing hanging out of windows  and all those people in various stages of undress along the river. Even the riverside concerts that attract thousands of people in boats along the shoreline at night, were exciting. The boats move in and out on the tide and need to be constantly shifted into place, so that you don't drift away in the fast flowing waters. These are all heart stopping moments. Even in the boats, you don't want to be splashed by any Ganges water for fear of what it might do to you. It was a time that you never want to end. Any chance you get, do a cruise on the Ganges as a highlight of your tour and remember it forever."
Divine feeling,"As is said u don’t visit the Ganga, but she calls you.Enjoy the boat ride anytime of the day, or sit at the ghats and let the world pass by or attend the ganga aarti at the Dashaswamedh ghat.You will keep on going to the ghats each single day you stay at Varanasi."
Ganges river in Varanasi,Ganga flows generally towards South direction all over its journey from Himalaya to Bay of Bengal. Varanasi is the place where Ganga flows towards North direction. You can enjoy boat riding here. From boat you can see the ghats of Varanasi. Ganga Arati done here in every evening.
Fabulous ,Something that has been on the bucket list and wow seeing it was worth the wait. We did a sunrise and also a sunset boat ride. A must if staying for a few days
The polluted Ganges River,"We humans have polluted this great and largest river of India. It has been polluted through bathing of people and animals, laundry and related detergents, sewage, food waste. chemicals and other harmful wastes, cremation activities which leave partially burnt bodies in the water, other religious activities and festivals, and more."
A river journey to Varanasi,"We were with Explore Worldwide and we embarked on three boats plus a kitchen boat en route for Batoli Ghat and staying there on the sandbank overnight set sail again for a small village of Sherpa to visit the local school and then back for the last sail to Varanasi.  The crew were amazing and provided us with safe passage, comfortable tents (although it was very cold overnight and the condensation in the morning had covered the inside of the tent with frost) and they provided and excellent dinner and breakfast the following morning with limited resourses.Very enjoyable time was had by all."
A Sewer..,"The reason I am giving at five stars is because my experience there turned out to be magnificent due to being blessed yo have my path cross with two vey young Teenage boys. I walked along the river with them few hours laughing and having the best time. They were practising their  English and were also teaching me Hindi. We spoke about teenage pop culture here in India , their day to day lifestyle with school and home life in Varanasi. They also opened up about their dreams of becoming successful  pharmacists which just touch my heart.All of that time with them distracted me from the horrific stench of the sewer water, the cow, goat and dog feces floating on the filthy water, the horrendous hygiene looming in every corner around me.Being such a holy place , the locals which worship here should have more respect for it and keep it clean."
Great and Serene Place,"Every time visiting the river is such a calming experience. The Varanasi ghats are a dynamic place where as the hour of the day you will experience extreme calm and chaos of Aarti and festivities. If you are looking for spiritual experience then do visit the place. Spiritual experience is not religion based , it’s your connection with your own Devine and the ghat’s and extreme calmness of river facilitates that connectivity. Or one can say: WiFi connection is strongest! 😌"
mother river,"this river means everything to Hindu's. to me, it was an unbelievable experience to see what's going around here. Feel the saint athmosphere and just walk around with open senses."
Indian civilization,"Probably the ancient Indian civilization can be felt by a mix of faith, culture and music at the banks of river Ganges."
great place to see in india,"I find this place to be fascinating all day!I started walking around the river and sat to people watch then I return at night to see Aarti.I went back early the next day for a morning boat ride around ganges river and it gave me a different experience. I even visitwd the two cremation area.Every part of the Ganges River will give you different experience so make sure to walk, boat ride, and sat for a while to people watch or observe."
Relaxing stroll,"If you want to clear your mind, stroll the long riverbank of Ganges River. You can also immerse yourself here in the diverse culture of India and see beautiful Ghats also."
Ganges at Varanasi,"A magical experience on the sacred mother river at India’s most sacred city.Must be viewed from a boat at both sunset and sunrise for two unique experiences.The city is a bustling, vibrant and interesting mixture of locals, pilgrims, traffic, narrow streets and the most incredible driving.The golden temple is a must"
Everything you expect and more!,"Everything you have read about and more from the Ceremonies of Life to the cremations to the people begging to the worshipers coming to bathe in the Holy Ganges, this is what you come to see in Varanasi.We took a cruise in the evening to see the Ceremonies of Life from the water and returned the next morning to see totally different things.  It is good to see what takes place at different times of day."
Please come you won't be disappointed!,No number of YouTube videos can prepare you. Your limits will be tested at all times. Just book a nice hotel to relax in and you will have an amazing experience thst will last a lifetime
OMG,"What a place to visit either day or night.We travelled from our hotel and back by rickshaw.What an experience that was.Pretty scary.We attended the Aarti service at night. Walked along the front and then onto a boat.Motored along the front then gathered along with other boats to watch the ceremony.A wonderful experience.Next morning before sunrise back on a boat again and watched people bathing worshipping and cremations.We the  walked the back streets.Cows everywhere and all so old.Walked back to the bus through the bustling streets full of people stalls,beggars,traffic etc.You have to be here to believe it and take in the smell and atmosphere.Amazing."
Auspicious & Very Fortunate to be here and Take a Bath,"Take 3 dips with sankalp snan(bath) in this river will wash away all your sins. Its very auspicious and we are fortunate to know about this fact. It is a most sacred river to Hindus, and worshiped as the goddess Ganga in Hinduism. The Ganges is also the mother, the Ganga matha of Hindu worship and culture, accepting all and forgiving all."
Spiritual,Was a dream come true to pay homage to the revered Ganges. Place of absolute beauty and spirituality. Sadly couldn’t spend as much time I wanted. Would love to come back and just absorb the beauty and spirituality of this great River
Mesmerizing experience,"We visited Varanasi as TOURISTS and not for performing any rituals!!Our experience was exhilarating from all aspects. The river is so clean, we had a bath, we took a boat ride, and we were in the river to witness the Ganga Aarti."
Amazing,"We visited the Ganges twice - once in the evening and once at dawn.  We went on boats on each occasion.  At the time of year we visited the river was nowhere near it's peak and was often like a millpond.  And it was easy to see people and the odd camel or two on the other bank.Our evening visit entailed a walk through masses of people and vehicles before we got to the boat.  The boat took us to the burning ghat where maybe eight fires were happening as part of cremations.  Amazing place to see.  Recommended but don't take photos if you're too close just as a mark of respect.  Later we were with hundreds of boats packed into the river to enable people to see an aarti ceremony.  Very colourful.Our morning visit saw us on a boat in the middle of the river watching the sun rise while listening to sitar, flute and tabla music played by three young guys on our boat.  Magic.If you visit Varanasi - which is where we were - it's a mandatory part of the visit.  It’s an experience you will remember forever."
Daily Rituals,"Take a dawn boat ride on the Ganges, not only for the sunrise, but for the daily rituals being performed by the devotees and Hindu pilgrims. Witness funeral pyres at the two crematoriums, bathing, washing of clothes, holy men meditating; just soak in the activity along the ghats."
Special Experience,"We have travelled to New Delhi - Agra - Jaipur - Varanasi - New Delhi in 11 days and stayed at Varanasi for 4 days.  Our hotel (Hotel Varanasi Heritage) was near Assi Ghat, which is the southernmost ghat in Varanasi, and we enjoyed walking along the Ganges River up to Dashashwamedh Ghat every day and night. The water was cleaner than I expected. It was a really special experience."
Must see,"This is a must of your time in Varanasi.  One should go not only in the evening but again in the morning to see the sun rise from a boat.  They are two completely different vibes that must be experienced.  There are no words to describe this place, it's very unique."
An interesting trip.,We took a boat trip at 6am to see the sunrise over the Ganges. The sights were very diverse with people washing in the river and a back drop of bodies being cremated.The pollution and smell was certainly not pleasant!
Better than I imagined. ,Really enjoyed being on the Ganga and leaning about the culture of the people and was surprised how clean Ganga is
Mahashivratri 2020,"An unbelievable, unforgettable experience. The night before Mahashivratri, you’ll found thousands of young boys making a circuit around the city of Kashi barefoot from their homes. This walk usually involves 120km and ends at the end of Ganges of Varanasi. There is an unprecedented amount of active on the banks of the river Ganges. From burning bodies to yoga practice. It’s a place of complete contrast, it’s officially my favourite place in India to date."
Amazing,I never knew or  understood  the depth of the Hindu belief system . So powerful to be so close. The evening ceremony was unbelievable I was enthralled by it all. Wow
Ganges River,Ganges River is a holy river according to Hindus. One can take a glimpse of this beautiful river while visiting Varanasi.
Sunset and Evening tour,"Varanasi is arguably the most important holy place in all of India. Located along the banks of the mighty Ganges river (the most sacred river for Hindus), Varanasi embodies the circle of life from birth to death. There are close to 90 sets of ghats (steps leading down to the Ganges) in Varanasi - many for bathing and others for worship. Two of the ghats are cremation sites - a rite of passage for Hindus.  A great way to experience the ghats is via river boat that can be hired where the boats dock. The morning aarti at Assi Ghat and the evening aarti at Dasaswamedh Ghat are incredibly interesting, colorful, boisterous, and not to be missed."
Boat ride at sunrise,"No visit to Varanasi is complete without a boat ride; our guide suggested to do it early in the morning to watch the sunrise and it was a good idea.Before 6:00 am, the streets are almost clear; there’s no honking, no hustle, no crowds. The ghats look completelly different seen from the river at this peacefull time. You can hear people chanting quietly, and watch people placing flowers and lit candles offering on the water, or bathing in the river.  Considering the level of pollution and the deep brown color of the river, it’s surprising the waters don’t give off any bad smell. Some say it´s because of its  level of carbon from the cremations.Since there are no buildings on the East side on the Ganges, the sunrise is easily enjoyed from any point.  Boats come in different sizes, both rowboats and motorboats. Our tour guide got us a zithar player that played old mantra music.It was a lovely experience."
Spiritual and Peaceful Location,"Just wander along the Ganga (Ganges) river and inhale the daily happening. Walk slowly and enjoy the scene: Morning (sunrise on a boat), mid-day (hot walking tour to see the cremation and bathing and night (to see the Aarti ceremony).Very relaxing atmosphere (Note: as long as you avoid interacting with the different offers that you will get occasionally)."
"The no 1 attraction in Varanasi, the holy river of the Hindus ","The Gangah River , as it’s called in Hindu , is the holiest river for the Hindus and they come here as pilgrims. It is used for cremation of bodies and scatter the ashes in the river . Hindus also come to the river to bath in it and get purified . Also for yoga and different practices and praying .the name derive from 2 rivers called Varuna and Assi ."
An Experience,In the morning we went down to the river very early and saw the people bathing in the river and also praying for loved ones who had passed away.
Holy River Ganga,I'm on my second visit to the ancient city of Banares / Varanasi. It is great to see that the water of the Ganges is cleaner than on my first visit 7 years ago.
The India of your imagination ,"You can't describe this place, you have to see it and feel it for yourself. Overwhelming and peaceful at the same time."
Holly water,good experience and enjoyed boating in ganges river nice location must visit place in life time om namah shivay
A majestic sight to remember,"The ghats of Varanasi really present a marvelous view to any visitor. You hire a boat after bargaining, travel to the mid-Ganges and the boatman will take you from one ghat to the other. Each ghat has a story to tell and has its unique feature. Ganga-aarti is performed at the famous Dashashwamedh Ghat every evening which is witnessed by lakhs of people from the boats thronging the ghat at a distance. The chants of mantras, the blow of conch shells and chants by the bhakts echo the surroundings. During day time there are many hawkers selling souvenirs, which you can purchase after bargaining. You can also go for instant photographs with friends for a paltry sum of Rs.20/."
Surprising clean on the surface.,Two trips to this river. One walking the banks the second one on a boat.Walking is an experience with almost every local pestering you to buy things or visit cloth merchants or make a donation or something. Best time to do this is at sunrise and early morning when you can walk reasonably freely through the burning that's.On the boat it was peaceful apart from the driver telling you things. Sunrise was wonderful.
Beyond words,Varanasi is one of those places that I never imagined I'd make it to!Simply beyond words.Do your research and prepare yourself for a life changing experience.
A spiritual journey !!,Varanasi is one of the most important holy place in India. The Ganges is the the most sacred river for Hindus. The life on 84 ghats along Ganges is very spiritual. The morning Aartis at Assi Ghat and evening Aarti at Dasaswamedh Ghat are divine. An early morning boat ride to see sun rise is amazing. Ganges river experience at Varanasi is out of this world.Not to be missed !!
Varanasi 2020,"Ganga ghats, Echoing history though their majestic walls & architecture etched by perpetual tides is a spiritual & mystical experience."
Antonio,Probably the most fascinating and mysterious river in the world. Life flows slowly along its bangs revealing a lifestyle unseen anywhere else in the world.
Ravi Sahni,"Ravi  Sahni  is  a wonderful,  honest  and  sincere  guide,  he take   cares  of  all  his   clients and   would   highly  recommended  him   for   all you   want  to see  and  do   in  Varansi."
Very clean river in Varanasi,"Ganges river in Varanasi is very clean and wide, especially compared with Haridwar. It has totally transformed the whole city"
Sooooo interesting,"We took 2 boat rides , one in the evening which caught the evening prayer time and the other at dawn to catch the morning prayer time. Both trips were incredibly interesting , colourful, noisy and just vibrant but both were different form each other. A really recommendable couple of trips."
Visited in march 2019,It was my great experience to visit Gangas in march 2019.We all should preserve this world fame important river especially we should avoid use here plastic and other pollutants.
Peaceful respite from frenetic Varanasi ,"Worthwhile trip to the university campus and interesting museum. Clean, green grounds and relatively clean air"
Went for an early morning boat trip. ,We went for an early morning boat trip from Varanasi. The trip lasted about an hour and was on a rowing boat rowed for us. It was a lovely experience. From our boat we saw various buildings of importance and also people bathing in it. We also saw where the cremations take place. Worth a punt.!
Friends ,"Great to see, once in a life time opportunity. have always seen it on National Geographic it is very cool to see it in person. The entire ceremony at night and then the sunrise on the Ganges was a cool adventure."
Awesome Ganga cruise and artati.,"The evening boat cruise on River Ganga at Varanasi in the evening is enchanting, enjoyable and awesome.Air conditioned cruise starting at 5.30 PM goes on for 2 hours is lifetime experience.All along the Ghats it is  wonderfully lighted and clean. You can see all Ghats at night. The Ganga arathi is such a wonderful experience."
Revisit ,I have been here in 1988 and bring z friend to India for the first time i thought it was as n important destination.   Its a holy river called ganga by the indians.  Mother Ganga.It is so much cleaner that 1988 which is wonderful
Good,"Good place to go once.Of course,  here is not clean but you can feel India.I want to come back here again."
mesmerizing beauty,The holy Ganges provides us with utmost beauty and charm. It is so good just to sit on the ghats and enjoy the flowing river.
Fantastic and very calming. ,We went on the Ganges 7am on a small rowing boat for me and my wife. It was lovely and worth getting up at 5.45 am. We came back for breakfast. We had 1 hour on the river.
A long sought experience...,"I read about the rituals in the Ganges many years ago.  On my last two trips to India, in 2008 and 2009 I didn't get to Varanasi, but I made sure to go to see this on my trip in November.  Varanasi is a complex city, with no vehicle access to near the river, so you walk through narrow, crowded streets to get to the river.  We stayed in a hotel overlooking the river and then took a tour by boat at 6:30 am, in time to see the rituals.  It was a powerful experience.  If you do it, be sure to read about it in advance.  Our boat trip was part of a larger package of visits, all worthwhile."
Boating at Ganges!,Boating at Ganges and feeding the Siberian bird was lovely moment. I could not remember how many numbers of Ghats we were described. The evening Aarati was so phenomenal. Highly Recommended.
Beautiful,I liked everything here from boat ride to evening aarti to pleasant vibes .. it is must experience in varanasi!
Stunning views!,The boat ride along the river bank was simply mesmerising. The celebrations were a joy to witness as well as the art work on the walls.
Varanasi visit,"I spent 5 days in Varanasi and enjoyed my time along the Ganges. I had a boat tour the first night which went to the centre strip before taking in the burning Ghats and the Hindu religious ceremony from the boat.Walking along the Ganges is enjoyable once you get away from the main 2 Ghats in the centre where there is some pressure to sell massages, haircuts, boat trips etc.I would say watching the ceremony in the evening which starts around 18.20 is a must but try to get there around 17.00 for a good seat."
Holy river ,This river in varanasi and known as mother ganga when you have bath in this river you get rid of all yours sins
Spiritual place,If in Varanasi you must see the river- it's the lifeblood of the city and really what Varanasi is all about. Take a boat cruise and see the ghats from the water (don't put your body parts in the water though) and maybe watch the Aarti sunrise or sunset ceremony. See the cremations taking place and perhaps have someone tell you the spirituality and significance of the river.
Amazing,"If you are coming to Varanasi, you can't miss Ganges river ghats Sarnath and meals at Shree Shivay Varanasi."
Unfortunately there was no sunshine and very hazy regulating in unable to take attractive photographs,"Interesting culture but very dirty buildings, many of which are dilapidated. Not as colourful as seen in published photographs"
All your senses will be challenged,"Your eyes, ears, taste and smell will be challenged in an extreme extend. Varanasi is one  of the most interesting place in India with the river Ganges as the center of gravity."
Boat trip,You’ll be asked hundreds of times if you want to rent a boat. Go for it- go early and see the sunrise. The ghats are full of yoga sunrise worshippers and it’s incredibly evocative.
must not miss in Varanasi,Witnessing the charm of evening Ganga Arti ceremony in a boat is an experience that allures even an atheist. Exploring several ghats in a few hours and witnessing the puja and other religious rituals is something that one must not miss in Varanasi.
Great Cruise,"We took an evening cruise on the river for a view of the Ghats, and were pleasantly surprised with the environment. A must visit"
Peace of mind,I really would like to visit once again. I love the evening aarthi and ganga is so beautiful and serene.
One of the Greatest Rivers in the World,"Ganga is one of the biggest, greatest and longest river in the World. Civilizations evolved around this river for over 5000 years. Its quite clean. One can feed birds flying around you while taking a boat ride. During boat ride you can experience 15-20 km ganga ghat with various old structures."
Amazing,"Very nice to visit wid friends.we came frm oman,had great time wid them,beautiful place,nice atmosphere!!"
"One Mother of Indian Culture, Water from Himalayan glaciers and melting mountain frost","Only 80000 years young, it has given us a culture belonging to the world as kings, emperors, conquerors, saints , rich and poor have gone but it flows ceaselessly. The houses are built 40ft above water level for flooding. Peak flow is 70000 cubic meters per second.  In1896, E Hanbury Hankin, a British physician was the first to see that bacteria died within 3 hrs in ganga water but were alive  even after 48 hrs in distilled water.(But with a science education, I would be afraid to drink it , but may have drunk it many times at religious ceremonies unknowingly- another mystery). Its charming to take boat rides from Assi ghat. Water has a mesmerising effect. You can see how the cremated bodies ashes merge into nature on their way to the sea creating soil, salts and arise again as living creatures. Apart from theories of the soul, it partly or completely drives away the fear of death and ignominy to merge oneself in this. In deep Vedic mysticism air, water, flow (of energy?) , purification andthe ultimate power are same.(in my limited understanding, pardonez moi). A lot of fanfare, activity, music, culture, shops, temples and a special culture of Varanasi are on its banks. Do not miss the Ramnagar palace, the Vyasa Temple (and its legend) and a mysterious small altar bearing a tortoise nearby , could be the Kurma avataar of Lord Vishnu, or the tortoise that bears the world (like Atlas). Mysterious and spell binding."
Wonderfull exspereance,this is a must see .....its mind blowing...do an eveing and morning boat trip as you see differant things.Buy a candle to float ....feed the birds...people whatch its all good stuff.
The River Mother of the Indian Civilization,"Thanks to the present Indian Government which focussed on cleaning up the river, it flows in its pristine form attracting countless tourists and devotees from all over the world. A boat ride, up and down the river is an experience to cherish for a lifetime. The ghats are clean, no more half-burnt dead bodies floating in the river, no effluents being discharged, no plastic bags...Jai Gange."
Worship the god in the world,Varanasi ganga River oldest river in India which school have a great that a God flow all of the time which is board give natural powerful energy to do
Ganges of ganga,Most desirable and beautiful places in the world the beauty itself lay here. Peaceful and cheerful location.
"Intensity, paradoxes and extremes","It is hysterically absurd to be rating the Ganges River, specifically the ghats of Varanasi.  Something so timeless and profound transcends personal judgement.Suffice to say, brace yourself for spirituality in a raw and uncompromised manner.  Every nook and cranny houses an ancient devotional shrine but you must side step the excrement and urine to view them.  You will be ducking children's kites one moment then stepping around corpses and the infernos that consume them the next moment.This is pilgrimage at it's most richly diverse and unflinching.I'll be forever grateful for having experienced it."
Enlightening,"So glad we experienced with a knowledgeable and thoughtful guide. I learned so much about this holy site but wasn't prepared for the heavily polluted air and water. Having someone who could share the importance and help me focus on more than what I was seeing with my own eyes and Western bias ensured that the experience was meaningful (and not just sad). The evening prayer rituals are heavily commodified but absolutely worth it. For going out on a boat, there was a big difference between morning when birds follow the boats and afternoon when you are swarmed by mosquitoes."
The best way to feel Varanasi ,"The river at night is stunning and behind the flashing lights you can see the 3000 year old city’s bones, her peacefully breathing and the people rambled though her veins."
You Come to Varanasi for This,"People are dying to die here - so they can be burned into this holy river. I heard no more. It has been banned. I am not sure. But it is definitely a much better place to visit than before. In fact, I did not see any cows by the ghats and no piles of dung which was so prevalent in the past. The serene holy experience will have you sink to your inner self as you watch the sunrise and sunset. Better yet, take a boat ride in the morning or sunrise and boat ride in the evening for sunset and watch the old, old and very ancient buildings."
Ethereal,"The mighty Ganges is an epitome of unconditional acceptance , pilgrims , tourists , devotees all flock to her , Maa accepts everyone , she cleanses them snd gives a fresh lease of life . The sanctity and hallowed aura needs to be experienced in person . Time stands still be there in person to experience the magic . Boat ride thru the ghats arranged by mr . Vineet of mangalam travels was truly memorable . ."
"Fascinating city, especially from the river","As much from walking as much of the riverside as you want with an easily accessed walkway, occasionally up and down steps, it is from the river itself that you can also have a great experience. We took a morning and evening boat ride of two hours each. After all you have travelled this far to see Varanasi so why not, it was only $30 per trip for a large motor boat to ourselves ensuring comfort, stability and great views. The morning was a trip seeing the river awake at sunrise and the Subah Benares ceremony at Assi ghat. Ethereal as the morning light came through the mist to see people going about their early morning worhip. From just before sunset to darkness and the Ganga aarta ceremony at Dasawamedha ghat it was even better. The spectacle of boats, people, noise, chanting, bells, smoke, temples and other building lit up reflecting off the water, really special."
Bliss thy name is Ganga Mata,"We can feel the difference in the cleanliness of Ganga River. No doubt some more need to be done to make it 100% which might take a little more time. All said and done it is the faith, devotion and bliss which is important than anything else. I am blessed by Ganga Mata"
Ganga the holy visit,Ganga the holy river is a soothing place everyone comes here to  wash their bad deeds and to say sorry if they have ever done wrong. This place satisfies the inner you. You can chill here everytime
Raw and Highly Charged Experience - no filters here!,"The absolute highlight of my short weeks in India - be warned, this is an important highly religous area for people and there are NO filters to what you can see.In the evening, took a boat ride and watched open cremations on the banks - be assured you cannot see those that are no longer with us as they are wrapped but not in coffins.  Families build the fire and then set light to the area - this is one of the most humbling and emotional experiences I have witnessed even from afar. If you have any doubts on this I would advise that you ask not to see this.After watching evening's ceremony from the boat which is full of colour, music and celebrations for thousands of people I took a walk through the streets - WOW, what a place!  Again, no filters so you will see lots of begging and homeless people in this area.Following morning was back on the river for sunrise - again, no filters here with people bathing and cleansing themselves whilst in prayer, there is no nudity that I saw but this is a deeply emotional experience.A stunning beautiful and very raw experience had - walking through the older part of the city is down narrow and sometimes quite dirty areas, it is just how it is"
Inspirational,We rented a boat to go see the night Aarti. It was a wonderful experience. The vibe of the night and reverberations of the Aarti just added to the eerie feeling. Highly recommended experience.
Ganga Ghat or Assi Ghat,"Ganga Ghat aka Assi Ghat where the world-famous Ganga Aarti takes place every evening is the most happening place in Banaras or Varanasi. The ambiance there at the Assi Ghat at the time of Ganga Aarti is really amazing. People from different parts across the globe visit the place just to enjoy the truly religious Aarti. They try to occupy the place wherever they get the space on the Ghats whether it is the stairs or the empty space. The Trust also runs Cruizes in the Ganga river for the enjoyment of the people but at the time of Aarti, the cruize with people on it, is parked in the river so that the people on the cruise can have the view of the Aarti. All in all, it is just an unbelievable experience."
Ganga Aarthi ,Took a non mechanised boat from Assi Ghat and had a super ride through all the Ghats and settling to watch Aarthi. Must do
Awesome - but not for the faint of heart ,We spent three days down near the heart of the action.   Fewer beggerers than before but still a crush of humanity.  The open creamatoriums will compress your head if you haven't experienced it before.
Ganga river one of most prayed river,The river is great and viewing it justifies that river is immortal..I liked the ghat which built around it..You can see the natural beauty over here and can also do boating to explore further...
the mighty GANGES,"We did a sunrise and sunset boat tour on the Ganges and it was definitely 2 tours i will remember for a lifetime , we even had a dip in the Ganges opposite Assi Ghat"
Ganga boat ride and evening prayers,Must attend the evening prayers and go for a boat ride on the Ganga. It’s an unbelievable experience
An amazing experience,What an amazing and surreal experience to travel along the River Ganges. A visit to Varanasi is a must see - the people are friendly and welcoming.
Amazing Ganges,"We walked along the Ganges from our hotel, to the cremation ghats which were amazing - and no smell - which we expected. Also did the evening Ganges river trip on a small boat to watch the evening Aarti being performed and then the early morning boat trip to watch the sunrise over the river.Unfortunately it was foggy/smoggy but still amazing Varanasi is an incredible place with all the pilgrims, the cows everywhere and the traffic"
Early morning boat ride along Ganges River. Amazing experience.,"My wife and I did an early morning row boat ride along the Ganges River. We walked onto the boat form one of the ghats and then went on water for about 30 minutes.  We saw the density of river buildings, the number of persons bathing in the river seeking purification, the eternal cremation fires and the organised chaos that is Varanasi.The eternal flames with ongoing cremations surrounded by piles of bodies, be it in the ""VIP"" site (as described to us) or the general low cost site are confronting to see. THe noise and smell are overpowering. Currently the city is undergoing massive work in the old part where 300 homes have  been demolished to accommodate a corridor from the temple to the river bank.  They have demolished the homes but left the various private in house temples.  Also there is a large over fly road being constructed which has choked the city of officially3.5million people. I think this is greatly underestimated in terms of population, we sat in a traffic jam for 2.5hrs on one day alone. Given that Nirendra MODI the current Indian PM had Varanasi as his local constituency you can see there is $$$ being spent, happens all over the world!!!!!!It is the dirtiest place we have ever visited, and we have been to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Morocco and China, Mongolia to name a few.  Not a crticisim just a fact for us. That said we did not get sick at all. We were careful.A trip to India is incomplete without a visit here."
Mother Ganga,"A must see in India, not for the water itself but for all the type of interaction that locals have with it, they live in a simbiotic way with this river."
Wide,A river just really But hyped up by localsSmells okNot as impressive as the Congo river etc You will always see it in Varanasi anyway Little else to do there for single traveler A day or two enough To get to airport takes an hour Top tip Take a tuk tuk Faster in traffic which is constant horns and crazy
So unlike the usual river cruise,We had organized a private boat but due to lack of pilots we had to share. The boarding requires scrambling over other boats and the organisation is the usual Indian co-operative chaos. The boats are primitive but somehow the only modern cruise boat looked so out of place. The boats are in keeping with the whole vibe.The final securing of a position on the Dashashwamedh Ghat to see the ceremony was a exercise in craftsmanship as the boats helped each other get a view.We were there on Diwali so it was probably more crowded. I cant say that the ceremony was that exciting to a non-Hindu but being surrounded by believers made the atmosphere unique.The city walk was good but the river trips were the best
A must see,"You can’t visit Varanasi without going to the river, especially at night when the pilgrims visit and the priests perform the rituals. Honour on a boat so you can get a good view and then go along and view the other Ghats and crematorium"
Holiest place for Hindus.,"The Hindus like it if you use the Indian pronunciation, Ganga, for their holy river. Even though it is very polluted, the worshipers claim they don't get sick from drinking and bathing in this river."
Swimming in the Ganges river ,"Although I was in Varanasi when the river was extremely high, I still adore this amazing river. While extremely polluted, to me the river had such a calming effect to everyone around it. I highly recommend waking up each morning and watching the sunrise over the river. You will also get to see how important the river is to the people of Varanasi. Everything happens by the river from holy ceremonies, to bathing, haircuts and more. I read up a lot about it and made a decision to bathe in the river - and I don’t regret it one bit. I was extremely lucky to not get sick but it was a very enjoyable and relaxing experience for me. But definitely watch the sunrises and sunsets"
"Eat, Pray, Love",A sunrise and sunset boat journey on the Ganges when in India is a must. A truly emotional experience.
Magical place,"Lost in time, a magical fairytale of hopes and dreams... reawakens your humility and opens your eyes to a world that is on the fringes of reality."
Hard to Describe,"Varanasi is fascinating and hard to describe.We did the evening tour which was extraordinary. The Ganges was relatively clean but the rubbish as you approach and alongside is dreadful. We were harassed by young children begging.We witnessed the burning of bodies in two places: a family that  had a small piece of bone from the cremation of their loved one placing it in the Ganges from their boat and the ceremony that occurs very spiritual.The next morning returning very early and after a blessing from a Bengali priest we went out in a row boat and we were rowed up and down the Ganges for an hour. There were people washing themselves, holy men praying, women praying and so much more.The atmosphere was totally different to the night before and again the wonderful air of tranquility is hard to describe.After coming ashore we were taken on a guided walk through the narrow streets stepping aside from approaching cows, goats and shrines on doorsteps and in books. We came upon a shopkeeper selling small diety gods. What a spiritual place! I shall not forget it."
Amazing place,Varanasi is filthy but what an experience. The Ghats are an an amazing place but be aware that it suffers from SMOG in November not as bad as Delhi but worse than Agra.It also suffers from traffic snarls and closing of the entrance to the old city. Imagine an ants nest and that’s Varanasi beguiling but frustration in its own way which gives it its charm.
A beautiful view,A wonderful sight in the evening when  ganga Aarti being performed - a blissful experience. Also the crowd was admireable and not seen anywhere in the world.
Ganges is always in its full glory at Banaras,"Ganga River is always in its fully glory at Varanasi, you can't miss what all you can do here and see.From various ghats, to boat ride to a cruise and see Ganga aarti in the evening."
Amazing.,"As I was there when a festival was on we saw the vibrancy and colour of India which was very special. It is well worth taking the boat to cruise a bit of the river. Don’t believe the rumours of bodies going down the river, there was nothing of that!"
The ethreal Ganga,The Ganges tour both in the morning and evening with the unhotel travel company is a must do :) We spent over an hour and half during the dev deepawali and it is one of the most wonderful experience. There is something very special about the Ganga.
You CANNOT miss this!! ,"There are no words to describe the energy, history and controlled chaos that is varanasi. You have to see it to believe it. Words cannot describe how incredible the ganges River is"
Wow.,"Words can't do this place justice.Its incredible.Did a boat trip at dusk and saw cremations being performed on the banks, then further along there was a prayer ceremony underway. Most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. 80,000 people, including hundreds of boats. It was beautiful and I will never forget this monumental opportunity."
Ganga!,"12/31/18 the local Varanasi boat captains were on strike because the government was allowing big boat operators to give 'cattle boat' tours in the area. We felt badly for the ""little guys"" who struggle mightily to make a living, but it meant that we did not go out on a boat on the Ganges. I'm not sure how this has played out, but even walking along the Ghats of the Ganges is an amazing experience. Please be respectful of the funeral pyres as well as people bathing, doing laundry and performing religious rituals."
The legendary River,"After so many years of reading stories of and watching documentaries on the Ganga Ji (Ganges River) it was almost surreal to visit. We stayed right on the river and took a small boat out at dawn to watch the activity come to life. It is important for travelers to remember they are guests here in a sacred environment. Taking pictures of the funeral pyres and pilgrims bathing is intrusive. Being able to witness the ebb and flow of life on this important river felt like a privilege. Varanasi is active, busy, congested and crazy but while floating on the Ganges all is peaceful."
Boat Ride a rip off,"The boat ride on the Ganges during ""harathi"" is a ripoff. With the number of people visiting the various Ghats for the ride, I expected a fully organized system but I found a free-for-all. The rates quoted by the boat owner are arbitrary. Varanasi being the constituency of the Prime Minister I hope an organized system would be in place.Even though I visited Varanasi a few days after the floods and the river was flowing bank to bank, it did not have the grandeur of Brahmaputra at Tezpur."
Life-changing experience,"Words cannot describe watching the masses converge on the Ganges for their morning rituals and their evening celebrations.  The holy men, cleansing, spirituality, crematoriums.....all beyond description and emotions felt.  A once-in-a-lifetime experience"
Spiritually awakening ,"The place and the river has someone extremely spiritual which can not be explained in words . Although you do see bit of filth here and there , banks of ganga in varanasi are connected all along , this makes a long walk along the river possible and its really really heart warming. Boating along the banks and watching ganaga aarti in the evening is must for any tourist.Ghats are well lit now and river is cleaner now but its still work in progress."
Ganges early morning,"Got up at 4.30 got a rickshaw and then walked through the Old Town to the river. Went on a small boat tour. Absolutely fascinating and well worth the early rise. You have to experience this once in your life, it is very difficult to describe it. It was spiritually moving, and also very interesting."
Ganga Boat ride.,"The simple boats take you around the ghats with the boatman as a guide, is a good way to see Varanasi. The oddity of the river, here, is that it runs flows from South to North."
Must visit for Hindu's,A unique experience but I wish that it was cleaner.Time just flies away sitting on its banks and do people watching.
Iconic and filthy,"The mighty Ganga at Varanasi is a centre of faith, iconic and unbelievably filthy.For westerners it’s a big, brown river so different to the clean flow in the upper reaches, but is a cultural icon. Bordered by funerary Ghats where countless bodies are cremated, it is a must visit for anyone visiting India."
Mind blowing,We visited the Ganges twice during our 24hrs in Varanasi. Once for a night ceremony and once to take a boat trip along the river the next morning. Both experiences were totally amazing and nothing like anything we have seen before. You must do both if you’re visiting Varanasi.
the devine ganga river darshan and arti,Had wonderful ganga arti in the evening where the devine ganga river which is a godess for the hindus is thanked for her presence on the earth also the wonderful and flowing river is a treat to watch for all the hindus. would love to visit again.
Divine and serene Ganges,"Varanasi being the oldest living city in the world has its own life and culture! The devotion brought here is unmatched and makes this city so lively, nonetheless when you approach Ganges all the hustle bustle gets left behind and the Ganges covers you in with its serenity and deep meditating feel!As the boat went in deeper we were awestruck with the magnanimity of Ganges and a fresh aspect to see the city came  before us! A short while later the engine of the boat was turned off and it floated as if some part of the river! We saw sun set from there and gradually reached Dashashawmedh Ghat! Today as I wrote these words that same serene and meditating feeling is back on me, and aloud I think- Namami Devi Gange!!"
Boat ride in the Ganges,"I was fortunate to have been able to do the boat ride in the Ganges. I got here in October just after the flooding season. A day before the boat ride , I was told that the boating in the Ganges has been suspended due to recent floods and the water levels. I was fortunate that the boating services reopened that very day. Motor boats  can be normally hired for IRs 1000 to 1500 bto watch the entire ghats. However, the boating services had been suspended for two months until that day therefore we had to pay IRs 2500 for the same ride. We had to talk to several boat operators and bargain. Although we had to pay bit too extra it was worth every penny. The view of the Varanasi ghats from the boat ride is out if this world. It was my childhood dream to be able to do this therefore it made the ride exciting. You can choose to hire an entire boat or pay 300 per person to share the ride with other people. But I recommend you to hire the entire boat which gives you freedom to take pictures and hop off at any ghat."
Ganges River,Holy Ganges River stretches from Himalayas in the North to Bay of Bengal in the south. The river has become a dumping ground of untreated sewage due to lack of awareness among the dwellers of Varanasi.
Must see in Varanasi,"The ghat area in Varanasi is a must visit, very narrow roads where locals do their daily shopping for food and any other needs.Talking with locals and understanding the meaning and importance of the gangues is very important."
"a must see, taste, smell, experience in the fullest","A trip to India is not complete unless you visit this site along with the 15,000 pilgrims who arrive daily.  The tour down to the crematoriums is overwhelming to the sensitive but a privilege to share in this Hindu experience."
Maa Ganga,It was humbling to see the mighty river flow serenely in Varanasi. There are many boats for hire where we can take in the different ghats along the river in Kashi.The latest addition is the sleek Alaknanda cruise which operates morning and evening trips along the Ganges.The water is relatively clean .
Boat trip on the Ganges for sunrise,"Through our hotel, my husband and I booked a two hour boat ride for 1200 rupees (for both of us).The boat left from the Assi section of the river. A guide was onboard to explain about the ghats as we went past.The boatman would turn the engine off regularly so we could hear the guide talk.The sunrise was nice. It was good to learn about the city and the people. You see a lot of locals and visitors bathing in the water. It is a fantastic photo opportunity.I wouldn't do this again though, but worth doing once I would say."
SPECTACULAR VIEW,the name Varanasi  is due to the confluence of Varuna and Asi river so called VARUN-ASI or varnasi .it is a holy river has 88 ghats along the river. The aarti in ganges is a fantastic view to look at.the boat ride and ride in Alaknanda is  a splendid experience numerous activities take place along the Ganges riverside  which is different and nice to  watch out
great and spiritual place to visit if you can handle to see the poverty,"it is heartbreaking to see some of the people living in this condition, very dirty, poverty, washing clothes ,I was not ready and not have the stomach to see so many thing such as dead body in the river, burning the body and toughing  the ashes in the water too much to digest in one day visit"
Overflowing  Ganges,"Because of the higher level of water in the Ganges ,water velocity was little on the higher side but the purity was good.We enjoyed or bathing in Ganges."
Huge River,While we were there the River was very high. It flooded all the steps so we didn’t get to see the typical Ganges River. They also wouldn’t let you out on it because it was running too fast. Kind of a bummer!
Kasi yatra,It was a nice and valuable trip of my life.It teaches who oneself is in this world.Every human being on earth must go a solo trip to kasi during this monsoon season and be spellbound by the awe and majesty of the Ganges. TripAdvisor also helped a lot to know about these places and their input guided me in a very useful way thanks.
Holy ganga,Visited ganga many a times .awesome place .everyone  should attend ganga aarti but you need to reach 30 minute before aarti timing than only you will find suitable place for sitting .
Worst experience ever ,See the photo of attached goon collecting money. Visitors were forced to pay 100 inr and 200 for chair. When I asked for receipt I was warned of serious consequences. Some visitors shot video and was thrown out and not allowed to see Aarti. No respect for women’s/ senior citizens. Leaving Varanasi with sad memories and never to return.
Life and dead,You need to change your chip to understand and amazing this  incredible place. Ganges is the most important and sacred river to the Hindi people
Ganga Aarthi,Evening Arthi was amazing.  The disturbing experience was the corruption and pricing getting in. The guide that assisted us was shouted at unneccesarily. This was in conflict with this sacred event that we as tourists came to witness from thousands of kilometres away. It was disrespectful to the event in progress.
Blessed to be here.. ,"Recently I visited Varanasi to have Darshan of Kasi viswanathar temple and Vishalakshi Amman Temple.. Morning at about 7 am, I had a walk towards the holy Ganga river to have a dip and do our ancestral poojas.... When I reached the place, I was dumbstruck looking at the vastness of the Ganges and the way it flows.. You could not imagine or you could not express your feelings and the happiness you feel after taking the holy dip in Ganges.. I'm sure that you too will Be Delighted with satisfaction and peace..Come feel the vastness and hear the inner voice if your mind.."
Managed to get to one of the ghats ...,What an amazing thing to witness and I did manage to get a little Ganges water to splash on my head ... crazy crowded but everyone happy and enjoying the moment ... awesome ...
Holy River with excellent picturesque ,It is wonderful vibes place. Viewing the river from far itself could create lovely energy. We went during high tide so missed boating experience. So checkout suitable month to visit Varanasi. I was so blessed to witness sunrise in Varanasi. Something that shouldn’t missed during your stay here. It was beautiful and peaceful moment. Ganga Arthi.... Wow... Amazed with the synchronised arthi performance. The prayer song and music was soothing for my ears. We had wonderful view of the Arthi performance. Overall my visit created blissful experience within me. Will come back Ganga Ma...
Ganga tour and aarati,Spectacular is the only word . Don’t miss Ganga aarati. Happens every evening. Boats are available at all the ghats . Can go one round to all the ghats and watch aarati from the boat. ALAKNANDA is the cruise started recently shows 84 ghats. Assi Ghat and Dashashwamedha Ghat aarati is famous
The Mighty Ganges,"The river was in spate during our visit. All the gahta along with their temples, restaurants etc. were totally submenged. Even the Ganga Aarti took place on a rooftop"
Sacred Ganga ,"No words necessary for sacred Ganga. If you want to do as I did, hire a Tuk, Tuk to Kashi Vishwanath ghat. Our safe and helpful Tuk Tuk driver was Guari Shankara.  I stayed at the Madin hotel."
Flooding means too high,Very disappointed that they cancel the boat trips in monsoon season Came just to see the ceremony Please be aware of coming in monsoon due to this
Flooding Ganges,"We visited during the unexpected floods so all the ghats were underwater so it was impossible to wander along the steps watching the amazing rituals, however it was great to see the river get a big wash through and people still took part in their cleansing ceremonies which is what I wanted to see. We had to walk the alleys in search of those Ghats but it was fascinating, the Hindu monks who sit on wooden Dias taking people through the ceremonies before washing in the Ganges were actually set up in the street outside our hotel. I’m not sure if more people took part in the cleansing ceremonies but it seemed to me there were people everywhere jumping in😁 I wasn’t keen on the cremation service so avoided the burning ghats if it’s not something you want to see either just avoid the smoke filled areas."
Not a drop to drink!,"A holy yet hazardous river, how does one come to terms with this? The pollution levels are alarming & there is a distinct stench as one traverses the waters by boat. Why have we done this to ourselves? The world's oldest city with its enchanting, mystical ambience & spiritual splendour must be saved by all of us, collectively. Let us make that promise & support any effort towards that end!"
The Mother,The Ganges is believed to be the Mother of all. Visit both morning and evening. It's the lifeblood of the city.
Final Rites for Grandmother,"Maa ganga is at her strongest and the current and river is getting stronger by the day.  It wad most humbling to witness this when we came three years ago, we were able to see the pyres and shiv temples by the ghat. This time of the year, they are all under water, Nature!"
Amazing place to see all the activity on the Ganges.,Unfortunately the river was flooded and you could not get down the steps to see the Burning Piles.You had to hire a boat to view them and he wanted 3000 rupees for a 15 minute  boat ride.Best to not see in Monsoon season.
Love Varanasi,I visited Varanasi 1 week ago. Ganga was clean and I could take bath. Nice place and hotel and i love to come here again.
Jai Maa Gange ,We went there for Aarti and morning sunrise the people of Varanshi come for puja and holy dip in water. Every one my family enjoyed
An awesome Learning Opportunity,"It is already amazing to see the cremations and religious ceremonies that you normally see on TV, in real life. But if you have a guide who allows you to spend some time at certain spots while giving you context, it gives you tremendous insight into the Hindu Religion and the Indian culture."
The Living Godess in form of River Ganges.,The mythological living river runs and keeping prosperous of its basin from..north to eastern part of county
Cool cool,Nice that I visit ther in aday many times thanks to God it is very special day with you and helping me to stay comfortable with you
Sitting without  any tension ,The ganga  river is place where we have get Peace full environment and we forget about all our lifeliving  tension. This place is my first to relaxing and our mind will generally about other tensions
In early September,"The Ganges is huge, brown, swollen, swirling with powerful currents and speed in early September - you don't get to see the ghat steps (they're all under water) and the little boats that ferry people are out of service.  Still, it's mesmerizing to witness the full power of ""mother Ganga"" - especially around 6am or 6pm this time of year.  The river is filthy and toxic - resist the urge to take a dip here.  (Much safer in Haridwar or the hippy haven of Rishikesh.)"
Excellent experience and memory,We had Excellent experience and wonderful memories as we visited along with our Family.We wish to visit again in our lifetime ..
Lighter feeling after bath,Usually I always go to have bath in Ganga with my family and friends and feeling myself lighter and too much confident
Amrit,Holy river Fantastic time you can spend here with family and dip in Ganga made cleaning body and soul all
Blessed ,Ganga is our mother and having bath in mother Ganga with full family great blessings unfortunately couldn't enjoy boat riding because of stupid system
Night by the Ganges,A walk on the Ravidas Ghat...at night...with the mighty Ganges overflowing..of course the slush and sand makes it difficult to step in..it was a moment to cherish
Brown but full of culture and traditions,I won’t recomend you to have a bath but if you do that means that you are stronger than me! nice place to visit and please respect the traditions and the culture
Holy Ganga,There is just no word to describe the holy Ganga river.  Be there to feel it. We stayed to 3 days and took lots of boat ride to stay close to the river and watch all ghats at different time of the day and night
One River...Numerous Colors,"Be it the morning Arati at Assi Ghat, Evening Arati at Dasashwamedha ghat, the eternal flames of Manikarnika ghat, Glory of Kedar Ghat or Legends of Harish Chandra Ghat. Varanasi is always prepared to give you the unforgettable vista of the motherly river 'Ganga'"
India holiday,What a scintillating event....the ganga aarti.  I cant get over it. Amazing experience.  There were tons of visitors bit we still managed to find our way in the crowd
Sunrise on Ganges,Worth getting up early to do this. We started from the hotel at 5am and walked the final stretch down to the river. The current was strong so we couldn’t take a private rowing boat as our guide had planned and instead joined a group motor boat - with about 20 of us all sat round the edges. It made no difference and in fact felt safer I’m sure. It took about an hour or so and was fascinating. We took so many photos - there was so much to look at and take in. Great experience.
Clean Ganges,I was so surprised and happy when I saw Ganges river..It was so clean and neat...I couldn't even believe my eyes...because I have heard a lot about dirty Ganges river...
The heart of city,Awesome its awesome if want to visit ghats of river ganges u must visit the dashashwamedh ghat to enjoy the ganges arti even its it is too crowded at the time of Arti but yes it is the moment u will find you in heaven like the arti songs will blow your mind it is soul touching moment you will also find some guides there who explain the history of ghats and each temple made overthrere i met Arvind thanx dear.
The Cross Roads of India,"One of the most diverse and interesting places in India. This is a place where all Hindus must bath, drink the water , place the ashes of the dead and pray. There is nonstop activity involving all types of Indian culture.No trip to India is complete without spending a few days in Varanasi."
The lifeline ,River Ganges in Varanasi is a treat to visit. The ghats  along Ganges makes it serene and blissful. A walk down the ghats in the banks of Ganges is a real experience.  It is lifeline and a life experience to watch Ganges flow in its pride.
THE Soul of Varanasi,"First of all a BIG THANKS to PM Narendra Modi ji and CM Yogi Adityanath ji for giving the world a MUCH MUCH cleaner Ganga. The cleaner ghats also add to it's beauty.Every person we talked told us about the torture this mighty and sacred river was subjected too during the earlier regimes. All that has been stopped now. Though there is lot much to do, the Modi-Yogi combo have prevented the river from extinction.- Nothing can beat the experience when you see it LIVE. Be it it's expanse or the furious flow. - Watching sunrise on a boat on Ganga - MAGICAL- Watching Ganga Aarti overlooking Dashwamedh Ghat on a boat - MESMERISING- One can easily spend hours and hours on the Ghats.- High energy environment."
Connecting Emotionally,"Ganga ghats in Varanasi is a place where you will have different feelings with different time in same day.Most of the time I saw my guests bursting out in tears in evening boat rides and going into noble silence in the morning boat ride.Manual boat ride is always better than the motorized one.Sitting atleast for an hour at Manikarnika ghat (burning ghat, constructed in year 302 AD), will enrich you with detachment and will settle down all your anxiety and depression.Assi ghat is majorly crowded with youngsters of Benares Hindu University. But good time in the evening can be spent here having honey-ginger-lemon drink in Pizzeria."
An Unforgettable Experience,"We had the opportunity to walk many of the Ghats, be on the Ganges for sunrise and sunset, observe people bathing, washing clothes, seeing cremation services and observing the Ganga Aarti devotional ritual being performed.This is a unique experience -  being able to be on The Holy River is a once in a lifetime opportunity.Nothing we have seen in our overseas travels compares to this."
Best sunrise of your life,"Go there at 5am when the sun rises, it is truly one of the most spiritually beautiful moments you will ever witness. Pick a Ghat and be curious about their rituals, see them bathing in the Ganges and washing clothes - respectfully."
River Ganga ghat,"Thanks to Mr PM & Varanasi’s people who has made river Ganga clean & beautiful for everyone, LOVE & special thanks Enjoy boat rides & Ganga Aarti"
Exciting experience ,It is definately worth a visit. The atmosphere is very special . Lots of people at the Gaths both Day and Night. Quiet a lot of beggers and people who wants to show you their factory.  Dont follow Them..
Condensed India! ,"India in its unlogic, bright coloured, loud life full of dualities is here. Intense in every aspect. Go and enjoy, just don't underestimate the strong energy of the site. I wouldn't stay for long there, it's great and exhausting on the same time"
Holy Mother Ganges ,"We visited twice, afternoon and evening( - enjoying the sunset and a holy ceremony); then Sunrise.We saw the eternal fire and hindu cremation pyres. This was incredibly moving, emotional and poignant.The next morning we were up at 3.30am to see sunrise and experience life on the Ganges.The color and vibrancy, bathing and offering is unbelievable.If you have the opportunity to see Mother Ganges, do it."
A must visit while in India,"A contrast from other areas we visited in Northern India and a must see on any visit to India. Just to watch the local people bath, swim, and engage the Ganges in their everyday life was both amazing and spiritual. Some people may not want to view the everyday life associated with the Ganges, especially the ceremonies and cremations at the Burning Ghats and the way people go about their lives but it's an amazing experience and tradition to view. I was really surprised the Ganges was cleaner than I imagined, above water at least. Varannsi is a destination to put on your list, if only for a couple of days."
Maa Gange,You cannot miss the Ganga aarti in Varanasi. It is a divine experience to witness both celebration & mourning on across the same spread of ghats. On one side you are celebrating life hoping to get Moksha and the other side people are mourning the loss of their loved one's life.  Must take the boat ride that's priced at 100 bucks per person. We got cheated and paid 1000 bucks! by this dubious guide. Just ignore them and bargain hard with the boat men.
Must come to see Ganges ,Ganga river is holy river which must see everyone. We also enjoy subah benras and Ganga aarti .  You can see all ghat along Ganga river . You can enjoy boat ride you can feel best experience
It All Happens Here,"This is the raw, intense, authentic India. This river is considered holy and where Hindu's come to wash away their sins by bathing in the river, they cremate their loved ones and dump their ashes into the river, they wash their clothes, there are prayer ceremonies very day. It's hard to imagine how toxic this river must be with the sewage and waste that goes into it.  But seeing what all goes on at this river will leave a mark on your own soul and how you think about life here and this experience will stay with you forever."
Boat riding a must on the Ganges!,"Ganges offers two completely different views once during sunrise & the other at sunset. During sunrise you will see locals starting their day washing, bathing etc. while in the evening the banks are beautifully lit-up from one end to another. A must do if you are in Varanasi."
Worth an experience,The river view is a very mesmerizing experience for someone who believes in mythology and Indian culture. Millennials don't find the river and the access road very impressive. It is crowded. Cleanliness level is poor. You don't get good restaurants in that area. Not good for disabled people. Toilets are scarce and dirty.
Bridge over the Ganges,Travelling from Corbett N.P. towards Delhi I arrived at a bridge crossing the Ganges. As there were roadworks going on my driver dropped me off at the start of the bridge and arranged to pick me up on the far side once I had walked across .   This was one of the most memorable walks I have ever taken . The river is very wide and full of different activities . There were :farmers on huge islands growing crops on the fertile soil ; fishing boats ; Holi men bathing ; women bathing in a dedicated area ; a funeral pyre and a strange watercraft removing rubbish from the river .   This unexpected experience proved to be one of the top highlights of my stay in India .
Ganga river,Am Ranganath.Stayed 5 nights in Varanasi WoW. Lifetime Experience T GangaAarathi Can never forget Modiji PM Varanasi t Best.Ganga Aarathi awesome Experience T night view ghats evecatching.Every Indian must see
Unexpectedly Amazing,I found the whole experience on the Ganges amazing.  The ceremonies were solemn and compelling. It is a sight I will never forget.
"Varanasi, that's all to say","Varanasi? Yes, Varanasi - the place with universities, yogyes, ashrams, Ganga river and all of the exotic :)"
"Go to this place and be blessed!  Amazing, otherworldly,  spiritual place.  Holy place.","Went for a boat trip on River Ganga to see Aarti. So worthwhile!  Lit some candles and floated them down the river, it was an amazing sight to see all the lighting candles at night!Then had a Satsang with our Sadhguru from Isha, on the river, looking out at Manikarnika Ghat. It was one of the highlights of my life.  So grateful for this."
Sunrise tour,Fascinating experience watching the ritual of morning bathing. Take a boat ride to see cremation areas and buildings on the banks of the Ganges.
Amazing ganga view,View from boat is awsm..its very clean and clear..services from varanasi voice is so cool and nice..lovely experience
Holy River Ganga,In Varanasi holy river Ganga attracts lots of tourists. There are various Ghats on bank of it . Various activities take place on both side of it . The Ghat side water is not clean but other side it’s comparatively better . Different types of boats are available for boating.
Always vibrant,"We visited twice - early morning for sunrise and early evening.  We took a motorised launch in the morning since we wanted to cover the length of the ghats and initially planned a rowing boat for a shorter route in the evening.  However we decided to be respectful and kept to the landside steps in the evening.  The boat quietly slid us past the variety of temples, palaces and buildings that service the ghat activity without our intruding in the daily ritual of life and death."
Cultural visit. ,Excellent commentary given By Ravi our Boat rower. Very Interesting to see in person. Varanasi is deeply steeped in History & Cultural Traditional background dating back 1000's of years ago. Seeing is believing.
Amazing place,"Amazing river, so much history and culture.  Was a bit shocked to see dead bodies floating by though!"
The most important river in India,"Ganga is considered as sacred river, which waters can heal the people from many diseases. In Varanasi many events are taking place at the banks of the river. The most popular are early morning and evening boat cruisesfor the local people and the visitors."
Nascer do sol no barco - Sunrise at boat,"Vale a pena. Pagamos 800 rúpias dividindo em duas, e passeamos na outra margem, que se parece com uma praia. Vibe incrível! Negamos dar gorjeta.Worth it. We paid 800 rupees dividing in two, and we walked on the other shore, which looks like a beach. Awesome vibe!"
Take the Sunrise and Sunset Boat Rides,Everything about this area of the Ganges River was fascinating but one of the best ways to see it is to take a Sunrise and Sunset boat ride.  One can see the whole length of the promenade and the boats also go fairly close to where the cremations are done although it is disrespectful to take photos.  During the Sunset ride you can place lighted flower candles on the river.
Dip urself not to wash the sins away but to lay in gange's lap !,"thisi s the BEST OF ALL !!! going early morning to the other side of ganges , finding a place where there s none and standing in the cold water looking at the ghat , turning to look at the sun rising and a dip with OM TAKES U to the world where there s none except u and the God!! it s the ultimate thing to attain PEACE !!"
Sacred river tests faith ,"You can look at the river Gange in Varanasi in two ways. As a normal architecturally meaningful location or as a focal point of faith. From an architectural point of view I had the impression of much faded beauty. There MUST have been a time when all those palaces and houses were flourishing and the city shore was of a stunning beauty. Now most of it looks in very bad shape or crumbling. It feels like meeting a once famous beauty that didn’t age well.You see people bathing in the river, praying in it or on the Ghats. It takes a lot of faith just to enter in that water, which could well send a westerner straight to the hospital, and a lot of concentration to be able to pray in the incessant noise that shrouds the Ghats.Not for the faint hearted."
Nice Experience,Saw the river from very close range while touring Varanasi City. Parts of the river are being cleaned & maintained with plants on the sides & the river & banks can also be seen from the number of bridges that you pass by
Great Experience,"Saw the cremations, went by row boat up and down river to see life today. Same for thousands of years. Don't miss this river. So much to see."
Ganga at benaras ,The holy mother - river ganga is always a treat to watch and have a bath in. The ghats of benaras are clean And good and one may have a boat ride across the ganga to see the beautiful sun rise and the Alaknanda cruise in the evening at benaras.
"Peaceful, loud, dirty, holy and amazing","We spent a few days in Varanasi and our time there is dominated by the Ganges which, like the city attacks every one of your senses. But don’t miss it.From watching the Pooja ceremony from a boat in the evening, from encroaching on a cremation ceremony, to a peaceful morning boat ride to see the sun rising it has it all. Dirty comes from the pollution which is plane to see but you do get used to it as you marvel this different world.There are plenty of ways to see the river - ours was quite short but still hugely enjoyable"
"It may be a holy river, but it's still dirty","For the Indian people it's a holy river, but I wouldn't swim in it. While on a boat ride I saw places where the water was thick, black and gooey. Still people swim in it, wash their clothes and off course throw human remains in it. Having said that tho you cannot visit Varanasi without seeing the Ganges and at least take a boat ride in it."
Holy river quite clean now,I was visiting the city after a long time and found the river cleaner than before. Must hire a boat to see the ghats from the river.
Darshan,Excellent superbbb just wawooo ganga ghat i like so much wawooo wonderful  varanasi ganga ghat i love my countries
River Ganges (The mother Ganga),"Visited at Varanasi, it's a must do. Totally alien to a European in soooooo many ways.Explored with a guide which was a great idea. Boat ride at Sunrise or sunset is a must.Probably won't ever experience anything like this ever again."
Trip to holy city varanasi ,Beautiful city .lovely ganga aarti u will divine..nice places to visit ..must visit kashi vishwanaath darshan nd sankat mochan .
Varanasi Ghats,"The ghats are what Varanasi is all about.  We had a guide for a half day walking tour (organised by our hotel).  He explained a lot about what was occuring on the riverside including the cremation rituals which are only conducted at two ghats. With this knowledge, a highlight of my trip was spending a couple of hours just walking by myself along the Ghats and absorbing the culture."
Great views amazing time,Varanasi is essence of India and ganga does justice to it all. Definitely recommend to anyone to visit this beautiful city!
The reason for visiting India. But BEWARE of.....,"OMG, the most amazing trip! But beware of sudden strikes by the boatmen! We were lucky. We did the sunrise boat trip and enjoyed it so much we wanted to do it again the following morning before moving on to Agra. Sadly, this was not to be. There were no boats the following morning at all, so other travellers who were only spending one night in Varanasi missed this spectacular and fascinating sight of colours, rituals, funeral pyres...Another point to note. We were not informed that the trip is equally enthralling at night time and so missed the opportunity to experience this. Very disappointed. Despite that, this was a truly wonderful experience."
Nice to be,These ghats on the bank are awesome. River was pretty clean. Had two very pleasant boat rides. The best place would be sitting on Assi ghat.
Amazing,"This is the reason you go to India.  It is beyond anything I had experienced before. Cows, monkeys, dogs, chickens and people.  Some people in the river doing rituals, women washing clothes, cows doing their thing, many burning bodies (funerals). The sights, sounds and smells are worth it.  We were there at sunrise and again at dusk.  The Hindu rituals are fascinating and I learned so much.  Very moving to see the funerals.  It was one of the travel highlights of my life, thus far."
Ganga ghat- boat ride,"The water is little polluted, we had taken a boat ride while the ganga arti- its a totally bless full experience worth going specially in the evening.."
One of the worlds must do locations,"The opportunity to witness the ceremonies and experience the crowds and activities that go on concerning this iconic river is a time to be treasured. Lots of people gather to bathe in its waters and pay honour to the gods and their loved ones. Try and enjoy the crowds, the sights, the sounds and smells! Wear a mask if you must to avoid respiratory issues, as the smoke from the ceremonies and fires do linger depending on the breeze. Get on a boat to get a different perspective of the river activities. Things are happening on both shores so look around and enjoy. Try and get to the river shore at sunrise to witness the magnificence of the sun as it slowly lights up the sky. The orange sky at sunrise reflects off the river to add a wonderful backdrop to the activities around the ghats and river shore. Words cannot describe the experience, you got to be there. Sunrise and sunset for sure. Highly recommended."
Papá Jaime Jaramillo’s group ,"This is a most visit. The Ganges River have history, culture, magic. A lot to learn from the people celebrating dead."
Breathtaking,"On leaving our hotel at 5.15 am we were on the Ganges River 20 minutes later for our private tour with a guide and boatman. I never expected it to be so interesting, magical and fascinating. Our guide was so informative and we were spellbound with all that we saw. The sunrise was amazing. There were lots of crowded boats packed with tourists moving around in large groups and pushing each other to get better views. Ours was tranquil and we were so fortunate to experience this."
Terrible,River is so dirty and I can understand how to peoples can swimming in this river. I seen some people drinking this dirty water. Unbelievable
"Varanasi, Old City,Ghats, Ganges","Varanasi, the City of Shiva, is one of the most fascinating places on earth. It is a complete assault on the senses, sight, sound, taste, and feeling. If you are there for Shivaratri, when many saddhus converge to celebrate the Night of Shiva, you may feel like you are on another planet.Getting lost in the alleys of the Old City and getting found as you walk along the ghats by the river, Varanasi has many gifts for the visitor to discover."
Amazing experience,"At the end of a land tour covering the Golden Triangle and a river cruise 440 Km up the Ganges and back from Kolkata, we flew to Varanasi.  There we were privileged to witness several ceremonies in this most holy of Hindu cities - the blessing of Mother Ganga, sunrise and the daily ritual bathing ceremonies as well as, from a respectful distance, riverside cremations. The tour was organised through Uniworld who couldn't have been better at their organisation and showing us an India which most tourists never see. As we are not young and able to do the back pack thing, this was idea for us.  We are returning next year to see more of India."
Holy Mother Ganges,"Your trip to Varanasi will not be complete unless you witness both the sunrise ablutions of the Hindi and the sunset blessing ceremony on the Ganges. The water of the Ganges is thought to be purifying, and can remit sins.  Maybe I was just under the magic spell of India, but seeing the sun rise and set on the waters is like witnessing the circle of life.  At the setting of the sun, I offered my own prayers for my family and friends and was thankful for the blessings of my visit."
Good but not the cleanest,The river is sacredThe stretch is awesome The access is all over Just to have a dip sounds good but the cleanliness leaves a lot to thinkBut still it’s a good feel when you reach out to the water
Tourist attractions on and near River Ganges in Varanasi,"The Ganges is one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus. It is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course and depend on it for their daily needs. It is worshipped in Hinduism and personified as the goddess Gaṅga. Yoga is an important recreational and spiritual activity that is common along the banks of the river. You can find many classes happening along the river banks. There are schools that provide diploma courses in Yoga in Varanasi.Ashrams are common along the river banks. These ashrams are famous for low cost accommodation, meditation, yoga and other spiritual activities.There are 88 ghats along the river in Varanasi. Each ghat has a speciality and specific rituals and others.Ganga Aarti of Varanasi is the most important tourist attraction that pulls thousands of tourists to Varanasi.Boating in Varanasi is an important activity. Boating during sunrise and sunset will be aesthetically pleasing.There are numerous temples along the side of the river. There is a Shiva temple, which is partially submerged into the river. It is an important attraction to row past the temple in a boat.Apart from these, numerous attractions are linked with River Ganges. Due to the rituals and human activities, the pollution level of the river is increasing year after year. Measures are being taken to increase the purity of the water.As a whole, River Ganges is the reason behind travelers taking Varanasi tour."
Sunrise vs sunset on the Ganges,"It’s a tough call whether to take a boat trip at sunrise or sunset on the Ganges, so just do both. At sunrise you will see people bathing, swimming and washing laundry with the morning light tinting the buildings lining the river in orange. At sunset you will see the river worship ceremony, light a lotus candle and set it adrift on the water and keep out of the mayhem going on on shore."
Boat ride on the Ganges,We did a sunrise boat ride on the Ganges. What an experience. Sun rise was just beautiful The sights and sounds incredible.
The Varanasi Ganges...take a dip to cleanse your soul..,"She has flowed from time eternity. She holds the place of a mother in an average Indian's heart. She is Ganga...who according to mythology , has originated from the tresses of Lord Shiva. In Varanasi she forms a big curve, and myth has it, the the her water currents flow in the opposite direction in Kashi. Whatever it may be, for a tourist visiting Varanasi, a ride in river Ganges will make you the spectator of the ancient city, which has stood beside her since time immortal. Plus you will get that feeling of peace within the deepest roots of your soul...yes Ganges is capable of that impact on you. And if you can take a dip in any of the Ghats, leaving behind all your inhibitions, I guarantee you a feeling of Holy peace which will prevail in your body and mind for days.And of course, as mythology goes, you will be purified from all your sins! Well I have never missed a dip, whenever I have been at Varanasi and my favorite bathing Ghat is the Panchganga Ghat."
Pilgrimage with pleasure.,Visited with family from 26/3/19 to 28/3/19. All the bathing ghats are very clean and titdy. Though cows are seen their droppings are cleaned then and there. We have witnessed the Ganga arthi at Dasaswametha Ghat and the next ghat. We have taken a boat to see this spectacular show from the boat.Visited Sri Viswantahar temple and Shri Annapurna temple also.
You cannot miss,"Walking on the border of the Ganga, going from Ghat to an another, is one of the best social experience you can have in Varanasi. Every Ghat is different, with it's communities, stories and activities. You will be mind blown by the colours, the people, and the energy that is very special out there..."
Beautiful Memories,Ganga is the most respected river of indians and we treated Ganga not only even god and Moksha Dayani.....I visited there on 04th march and from Assi Ghat to all ghat by Boat in Ganga River and it was awesome feelings and nice view of all ghats of Varanasi from ganga river.
"Dirty River, but fascinating tour","We rode on our own private rowboat on the Ganges with a tour guide at 18:00 in the evening.   It is beautiful along the banks.   At 18:30 all the boats tie up to each other and there is an hour long ceremony.   Lots of music, vendors hop from boat to boat.   It was a lot of fun!"
A MUST stop for your education of Varanasi and the Ganges,"Whether you view by boat or walking, whether you stay at one Ghat or another, whether you view at night or early morning, the view and education that comes from the Ganges River in Varanasi is totally moving and superb.  Whatever paths you take, be sure to hire a good guide to aid your understanding; without this aid, you will miss a huge amount of understanding.  The cremations, the celebrations, the bands/parades, the street vendors, the religious personas on the river bank are all part of the picture.  It is a must for you to spend a few hours here on the Ganges to learn and appreciate a most unique part of India.  Please consider making time for your learning, understanding, and education."
Amazing river-side activities in ancient city,"We walked the whole length of the ghat from Manikarnika Ghat in the north to Assi Ghat in the south. The whole walk in incredible because of the sheer volume of impressions on your senses. There is a huge number of people, from all over India. I don't think it is possible to pick out any one ghat, there is a continuous stream of sights, noises smells people along the whole length of the walk.The walk should be accompanied by an early morning river trip to watch the sun rise and see all the ghats covered in the morning sunshine. Hire a private boat, the bigger boats are incredibly overloaded.We spent two days/three nights in Varanasi. The first morning was the Holi festival so the noise and activity was at fever point. We got completely covered in coloured powder and coloured water, 30 minutes in the shower got us clean, our clothes went in the bin. We must say this is one of the most amazing experiences we have had in India. Varanasi is amazing, if you can come here during Holi - all the better."
Walk the Ghats,"Walk along to see all the Ghats. Take a boat  either motor or rowing boat for the quiet( though you will still hear all the other engins) both for sun set and sun rise, entirely different experiences. Get up at dawn to see the fire ritual and participate in a mass, free yoga class/experience of course with the sunrise as back drop!"
So memorable ,A must see stop. We went at night to see the cremations and the ceremonies. Moving experience to light candles with flowers on plant pads and float in river. Returning in the morning was yet another experience. Witnessing others profound beliefs is something we’ll never  forget .
Ganga aarti,"A must see if you can handle the crowds. Beautiful presentation,  ambiance and celebration.   You forget about the crowds and noise while the aarti is going on"
Extraordinary,Varanasi is an extraordinary place and has to be seen to be understood. It is so special toHindus and should be respected by Westerners. I was shocked to see Westerners jump into the Ganges for a swim as I felt it was disrespectful.
Varanasi visit ,Fascinating place so unlike anything else I have seen.  A real insight in to the way Hindu’s approach death.  We took the boat trip on the Ganges to the Manikarnika Ghat to watch the burning of the bodies and spent some time just walking through the narrow streets. Varanasi is a photographers paradise. We had 2 nights there and felt that we had seen everything we wanted to see.
MY VIST TO INDIA IS NOW COMPLETE,I had two visits to the Ganges one afternoon and one to see sunrise.The sunrise was less harassed to get to the river as not all market vendors where open and not many boats on the river either.No safety taken and one takes ones life into ones hand no safety vest and a not so sea worthy boat .But to watch the Ganges wake up is amazing the sun rose like a glowing beacon and the pilgrims began their daily ritualsYes the river is dirty and I did not even contemplate immersing a finger into itCows and dogs where on the foreshore eating what was left of garlands and the fires where burningI was told that 250 cremations aday that is astoundingThe evening visit was totally different and one has to navigate the market vendors selling their wares and the children asking for food but again once you arrive and enter that not so safe boat without safety vest you get the true feeling of the GangesSo many more fires and on my visit deceased being carried to the river the lighting of the wood pile and the constant chopping of wood the stacks of wood already chopped the blacken building from the smoke and the people masses of people and the chanting ritual The only smell is of diesel from boats and the smoke so wear a face guard and plenty of bug spray I had on Deet and I swear the bugs are immune to it and be aware that the bug critters actually flew into my eye and I wear glassesChildren will jump from boat to boat selling tributes for you to buy to release on the river also a vendor selling coffee infact vendors selling anythingI am not a spiritual person so the Ganges did not effect me in that way but I was in awe of the fact that I was here as a witness to what has been happening for centuries and in a method that I dont think has changed  much in that timePeople will tell you negative things but this is an experience one cannot fully explain and one must do it to understand and if not just to say I have seen To me another tick off my bucket list
Stunningly beautiful,The history Varanasi breathes is incredible and the energy and history felt at the Ghats even better. A must see experience for everyone visiting India.
Surprisingly Clean and neat,"Namami Gange !! Jai GangeI was told by my father that I will not step into the waters or ghats as they are so untidy and polluted. However, finally when I visited the holy city - Ganga maa and the ghats were so clean. Noticed the ghats were cleaned thrice a day and the river always had a dredger collecting whatever small things floating around - like flowers and garlands. We visited towards the end of Kumb at Maha Shivratri day. Still the rush was not felt and the surroundings were clean and tidy. Salutes to administration. It was also encouraging to see the locals were giving full support to the efforts putin by the current government. The most irritating act of spitting tobacco on roads and corners were not seen at all. If the trend continuous - Gangaji will flow as pure as she is at Gangotri soon."
har har gange jai jai gange,"Clean, refreshing waters. The ritual bathing and 3 dips was pleasant given how clean the water was. A huge transformation from 2009. The enclosures for changing, made up with colorful saris acting as screens, were close to the banks to facilitate a quick change."
Early morning boat trip,We enjoyed this as much if not more that the evening ceremony. We were rowed in a boat along the Ganges and were able to view the morning rituals without feeling that were impacting on them. Watching the sun rise made my morning it was so beautiful - worth the early morning start.
Maha Ganga Sunrise Moonset on Paush Purnima,"Assi Ghat, Ganga River.        VaranasiUtter Pradesh, IndiaSunrise & Full Moonset     January 21, 2019Auspicious Day of Pausha Purnima Paush Purnima is a significant day in Hindu calendar. It marks the beginning of one month long austerity period which is observed during Magha month. In lunar calendar followed in North India Magha month starts from the next day of Paush Purnima.During Magha Mahina people take early morning bath in the Ganga or in the Yamuna throughout the month. The tough winter season in North makes austerity period more difficult. The daily bathing starts from Paush Purnima and ends on Magha Purnima. It is believed that all charity work done during this time are fructified easily. Hence people offer charity to needy according to their capacity.The holy dip at Dashashwamedh Ghat at Varanasi and Triveni Sangam at Prayag is considered highly auspicious and important on Paush Purnima day. It is believed that the holy dip on the auspicious day of Paush Purnima liberates the soul from the continuous cycle of the birth and the death.Shakambari Jayanti is also observed during Paush Purnima. The followers of ISKCON and Vaishnava Sampradaya start Pushyabhishek Yatra on this day.Tribes living in rural parts of Chhattisgarh celebrate Charta festival (छेरता पर्व) on Paush Purnima day.Pics & Videos from rooftop next to Assi Ghat. Listen to the morning pooja, chirping birds & cow moos."
Much better than expected!,"You read and people say the river smells bad and is dirty. It was not my impression. The little narrow alleys or streets behind the river, YES, they are full of trash, cow poop and puddles but even though, it didn't smell bad. Not even close to the crematories. We were there before the Sadhus convention and, I could believe my eyes. So much to learn from this country, their religions, food and, and... If you go to Varanasi, please, please go to the Aarti Ceremony. Be aware that if you stay within 500 meters of the river is vegetarian/alcohol free by government orders."
Must do,Both sunrise and sunset boat ride on River Ganges are must do activities. The ghats are best explored that way. Kindly negotiate with the boatman
"Beautiful peaceful place, unmissable",An early morning walk along the ghats is an unforgettable lifetime joy. The arti is magical and beautiful too.
unforgettable experience,"Another world with pilgrims, Sadhus, cows, monkeys.  A great place to visit.  Rahul was our god send guide."
Touris,Beautiful spiritual place full of life... Everyone should visit the ghats at least once in their lifetime!!!
Better than expected,"We were expecting dirt & nasty smells, but it was anything but.  If you have the time, walk from the Northern end of Ghats to the Southern end of the Ghats. It may seem a long way but the interest on that journey is well worth it."
Clean and Pure Ganges,I was very surprised to find the Ganges very clean and pure this time. We happily took a dip and felt refreshed.
Not for the faint hearted,"Walking along the Ghat you see life in such a different way from those who are very religious to those escaping from life. People praying, bathing, eating, begging. Dog and cows everywhere.The evening Aarti goes on for some time. I recommend you see it from above on chairs rather than from the boats.The morning and evening boat rides show a different picture and of course visiting the Cremation area is an experience."
Good place to visit for once,"1. Aarti starts around 6 45 pm , however due to various religious instrument being played , aarti was not clearly audible.2. Since aarti goes around for 1 hour or so, u may either book a small boat costing 100 per person or big boat costing 150-200 per person (includes boating also). Their is place to stand where devotees can stand and listen to aarti. No need to book any boat, unless u want to visit nearby ghats."
Varanasi visit ,A serene beauty which has a magnetic effect. Don't feel like leaving this place. River is clean with options of boat ride. Ganga Aarti is a must see event specially which happens during evening hours. A memorable and unforgettable journey with exotic moments.
Benares clean ganges,It was heartening to see a clean ganges and even cleaner ghats. There were dustbins on ghats inspite of that some uncouth people threw their bottles and empty packets all around
Maa Ganga....,In Varanasi one can experience a silent Ganga. Even though it is passes through cities like Kanpur(Famous for leather industry) water here is clean. One can take bath in any of the Ghats or simply float otherside in boat by paying Rs. 30(To and Fro) and take bath and come. If you want can enjoy boat ride from Dasashwamed Ghat to Harishchandra ghat and manikarnika ghat on otherside covering 40 ghats. Cost will be from Rs. 50-100 per head depending upon your bargaining power. One must never miss the boat ride here.
A mighty and holy river in India,"Ganges river in varanasi is a sight to be seen. Though it's level and flow varies from season to season, it still remains mighty even during low water levels. Considered as a holy river, having a dip in it is a must for Hindus to purify themselves. The river has several ghats alongside each with series of stone steps to facilitate people to reach the river and take the dip. Lots of people also use the boats to travel and do religious activities and see the landscape. Prayers in the form of Aarti is done in the mornings and evenings to the river ganga."
A must see,If you are in Varanasi then you must go to the holy Ganges River. It is a sight to see. We saw the Ganga Aarti ceremony at night. It was truly mesmerizing. A very eclectic group of people were gathered on shore plus on small rowboats. We were able to see the cremation ceremony from our boat. We also went back in the morning to see the sunrise over the Ganges. We saw people take ritual baths in the river.
Extraordinary experience,You have to take the boat at night to really feel the true experience  of the incineration s of the bodies. You feel the spiritual value and it is a tue life experience.
Be sure to take a boat ride on the river,Having a guide enhanced our boat ride. Getting to understand what is happening made our visit much better. The Ganges was actually much cleaner than what I expected. but I do not think I would be bathing in it like so many others were doing. Amazing to see the rituals and how the Hindu population reveres the river. Certainly a worthwhile visit.
Serene and beautiful,"The main attraction of benaras. Don't miss the evening and morning g boat tours, the two are very different and has their own beauties to behold"
The mother Gangaes,The gangaes is the longest river of India.It is called mother here and holds spritual value.The gangaes here is very wide and looks beautiful.There are many ghats here.
Amazing ,"The Gangey Arti what energy, positivity Divine 🙏🙏you have to be there to believe it. The priests who conduct the Aarti are smart Tall well dressed and fit. No body moves no space clean water messmering Jai Gangey 🙏🙏will visit again 🥇🏆"
River Ganges,River Ganges of Varanasi is a wonderful place to visit. The Ghats of Varanasi is immensely beautiful and a must watch place. I love this place very much and definately recommend others to come and enjoy the scenery.
To expensive.,The port of Ganges is such a rip off. To much money spent for it. It didn't even have a spa! So rude.
Magical place. A must see ,I have wanted to come here for years but seeing the Ganges exceeded my expectations. So many pilgrims (and few international tourists) and many holy men too when we were there because of the full moon and kumb mehla. They are doing some great work to clean up the river and the city and reveal and restore the many temples. It will be even better in a few years no doubt. For now it is a real privilege to see the mourners at the cremations and observe the devotees bathing in the river at sunrise.
Nice experience but so many flies! ,"We arrived around 5.30pm as the Arti starts at 6pm. We chose to go with a group on a boat, no safety jackets or instructions just get on and go. We had to wait for the boat to fill up with people, around 12/14 per boat. We got there around 6pm and waited a while for the Arti to begin, very nice experience and enjoyed it. Lots to see and I’m glad I did it, lots of pollution in the river though. We did set off the little divas into the river. Had an enjoyable time."
Scenic ,Loved the ghats and would want to spend my holidays and Sunday's on the ghats of Ganges river.  Beautiful and scenic
Incomparable River Jai Ganga Maiyya,"Ganga was unmatched for every Indian, and will remain. Even today, due to some people there has been a lot of mess in the Ganges but its water is still clean today. If you talk about this place then it is a wonderful place. I got great peace by coming here. This is a very sacred place and every Indian should definitely go here."
If the river could talk... ,"The river is so big that immediately brings images of humility. No wonder why the people consider it sacred.The aarti ceremonies happening on sunset at the different Ghats are nice to watch and understand the spiritual importance of the river to the people of Varanasi.The boat trip is a must do, ideally right before sunrise... Prepare your camera for this!A tip... They might become a bit insistent on the boat trip, try to do it sharing with more people so you save costs. Also, try to take a man-operated boat, the motor noise will ruin the experience.When visiting the riverside be ready to give donations to people that will paint a blessing in your forehead. There is a saying that says that you should not expect to receive anything if you come with empty hands... Just don't exaggerate the donation, a few rupees id more than enough.This is also an opportunity to learn about respect to others as you see so many people from different branches of the religion coming together into this place... They can all be friends! We can as well!"
An emotionally moving experience,We spent a sunset and sunrise in rowboats on the Ganges where we witnessed and participated in the cultures of the people of India.
Amazing and unforgettable experience ,The complex of things going on here is connect directly with the universe. Thanks Varanasi and Ganges river for this experience
Sunrise and sunset,All of Varanasi takes to the Ganges river at some times of day and a boat floating along the river is the perfect place to observe Varanasi life. You can get a great view of the ghats and all the activities on them and it gives a different perspective of the city.
Majestic ,"There is no doubting the serenity of the Ganges running majestically through the noise and chaos of Varanasi. Action everywhere with people, boats, cows, cremations and ceremonies happening all around. It’s still possible to find a quiet spot on the shore and watch the action on the river. The boat trip gives a different perspective to the city but is becoming very touristy. The sunset tour finishing with the fire ceremony will have you sitting among hundreds of other boats(you will sit among thousands of people on shore though). We found an early morning walk allowed us to see as much as the sunrise tour."
Nice and awesome,Very much holic place and we have explored the boating and bathing with friends. It was a very very good experience .
Ganga...The River of Life,"A must see experience at least once in your life time. For a moment, you will forget about concrete jungle that you might come from...and soak yourself in these sea of people, colours, rituals, sounds and smells...this is cradle of civilisation that started a few thousands of years ago and still going."
Great experience,"Boat rides along the Ganges well worth doing, morning and night. Used a Viator 3 day trip. JD was a wonderful guide, very knowledgeable and provided insight of the events on the Ganges. Highly recommend this tour."
Ganga Aarti from the River,"We took a boat tour in the late afternoon that took us from one end of the city to another about 7 Km covering all 80 ghats (these are access points to the river from the land above consisting mostly of steps and landing platforms in between). It culminated in us taking in the famous aarti at Dashswamedh Ghat (it is the biggest and most popular of 80 ghats). It is a well choregraphed spectacle, a Hindu ritual where aarti is performed for the river Ganges with priest chanting mantras and moving large plates filled with lamps in large swaying circles. Highly recommend it. Tens of thousands of locals and tourists come to witness it and it is fully worth it. It lasts about an hour so bring layers to stay warm. We also noticed smaller version of aartis being performed on several other ghats."
"Colorful, vibrant and spiritual.","Visiting Varanasi directly on the Ganges, believed to be the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world is an experience we will always remember."
A colourful river full of boats ,Wonderful sights at sunrise and sunset. Rowing boats are the main means of transport. Hindus everywhere bathing and washing. It is the only way to travel.
Ganga is clean,This was my first trip to Benaras and believe me I was surprised to see such clean water in the Ganges. Also no floating debris or flowers . The ghats were clean and well lighted.
DASHASHWAMEDH GHAT,"Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main ghat in Varanasi on the Ganga River.i was stying in wonderer station that is near by ghat and beautiful people.  It is located close to Vishwanath Temple and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu legends are associated with it: According to one, Lord Brahma created it to welcome Lord Shiva. According to another legend, Lord Brahma sacrificed ten horses during Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna performed here."
Keep you Camera Lens Ready,You will get a lot of photo opportunities at the ghats in Varanasi so all you need is to keep the camera lens ready to click few snaps.Tip: If you click snaps of any Saints please give them a small tip as they have no means of any livelihoods.
Shame that they don’t respect more this river,"The site is exceptional and a must. If it wasn’t as much polluted and full of trash, it would be one of the best attractions."
Don't miss this unique experience,"The Ganges River experience in Varanasi is a unique highlight of a trip to India.  The Aarti ceremony, the folks bathing in the river, the crematorium, the amazing architecture, the mass of humanity and the sounds and smells accompanying it are all unforgettable. We have not seen anything like it, either in India or elsewhere in the world."
Unbeliveable,"Just like travel in time! Unbelievable,  I have been there both in sunrise and sun set. It was quite strange experience if local beggars and boat riders leave you alone. Any thing they offer is reachable 1/5of price."
Fascinating place,"Incredibly fascinating. I stayed 5 days and other than 2 days venturing outside the river, everyday I would wonder the that's and Riverside. Everyday I see and experience something new. Every moment I feel the urge to snap a shot. So very fascinating. Yes there are tours, fake holy men and beggars. But I have met so many friendly helpful locals who have been kind to me, offering me help when I got lost (which was often). No they did not ask for money, just helped with an open heart. The shopping too was good!! Can be overwhelming but just with the flow and soak in all the experience. Boat rides morning n night are a must do."
Amazing! ,"This is a must if anywhere near Varanasi.  It’s full on, busy with people, animals, people selling, boat rides and street food.  Take an early morning and evening boat ride for a couple of £.  It’s truly a fab experience not to be missed!"
superb Indian immersion,"visiting Varanasi and the river was a highlight of our India trip. we walked the entire ghat ""strip"" so didn't feel the need for the boat ride. felt soaked in with the people and river experience. eat at one of the cafes right on the waterfront - they are all vegetarian there so don't waste your time looking for something else. we even brought some of the holy water home - cool souvenir!"
River,"Get yourself a boat cruise, evening for the aarti and a morning cruise. Not expensive by any means, but you must find out reliable guides."
A Must See,Even as a Christian I appreciated this and the significance.  You can’t appreciate India if you have not seen this ceremony and rituals.
