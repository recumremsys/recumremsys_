"Nice from outside, mundane from inside",It is hard to miss the Kremlin in Nozhniy Novgorod.  It looks awesome from the outside.  Inside however it is plain - several Soviet-looking buildings.
Kremlin,"The exterior walls of the kremlin are nice, as is the entry gate/tower. The actual interior is hardly worth seeing."
Disappointed ,Spectacular walls but little inside to impress. Mainly modern buildings with little if the original preserved. A much better preserved Kremlin can be found in Veliky Novgorod.
The ancient hurt of the city.,The ancient hurt of the city. The oldest building in the city. You can enjoy beautiful view from the Kremlin walls and have a pleasant walking inside the Kremlin.
An authentic Krelim pretty well kept,Heard this is one of the earliest Krelims in Russia (dated back to 1500s).The castle is very well preserved and is certainly a must-see of the city.
Amazing!,"Worth to walk around! In good weather, provincial, but charming! Beautiful view to the city, museum and gallery, close by to main waking street! Worth to spend Saturday afternoon or so to walk around and enjoy atmosphere!"
Definitely the highlight of Nizhny,Worth it! You can walk about 1km of the wall. Excellent site. Clean toilets. Helpful staff. The best thing we saw in Nizhny.
Impressive history details founding of Nizhny Novgorod,"Nizhny Novgorod was founded in of around 1221. The entire population could fit within the walled Kremlin, or capital, with several lookout and defensive towers. I am sure Nizhny Novgorod was attacked, but it does not appear to have been overtaken. The city also boasts one of the most striking tableaus of Nizhny Novgorod's addition to World War II, with and area for equipment constructed and used in the area. There is also a very powerful wall of soldiers lost in WWII. And down near the Volga River is an eternal flame for the unknown soldier. Very powerful. The views are beautiful and it is close proximity to city center."
Historical center,This is the oldest preserved Kremlin in Russia.  The main buildings inside the walls are Saint Sophia's Cathedral and the Novgorod Museum.  Dominating the central area is the elaborate Monument to the thousand years of Russia.
One of the nicest ,The Kremlin in Nischni Nowgorod is one of the most impressive Kreml I’ve seen.Very beautiful located above the two merging rivers here.Lovely view down to the Wolga and new town.
Wall Kremlin and more...,"Take a walk inside the Kremlin wall, enjoying the middle age experiences. Inside the Kremlin will find more..."
Government yet destroys another artifact.,"This is an ancient fortress and for some unknown reason government decides to build bunch of ugly government buildings and offices inside. Why? Not really a logical choice, because preserving ancient buildings and receiving fees from visitors seems to be a better choice. Well, instead they put bunch of weird looking buildings and some old machinery around front walls. Not really worth visiting. But it's quite close from the city center, so easy to get in and out if you have extra time."
kremlin,"The walls around this kremlin are still in good shape. The interior doesn't look like an old kremlin, as it is filled with Soviet style government buildings."
The place you cannot miss,"By being located in the city centre, you will definetely pass this place multiple times, It is historical, with pretty big area to walk. Went here in the winter evening, therefore did not visit exhibitions, however I heard there are more things to do, than just walking around.You also have great views and the feeling of history. Great place for walks!"
Please Help,"I said Putin looked like Dobby and ended up here, they said something about flaying, someone please help."
"Superb fortress , views of the city scape.","Brilliant free activity.Walk around the old fort. Breathtaking views, at the river confluence (Volga and Oka). Known as the city of military glory. This is its show piece centre."
Amazing Experience,Definitely a must see. The most beautiful views of the Volga River. Perfectly manicured gardens. Amazing to see the walls and towers.
A great landmark,"A great landmark in the city that you can walk around, spend some time to enjoy the history. Gives spectacular views of the town and the river"
"Interesting building, lots to do inside.","The Kremlin is a walled space. You can walk about halfway around the walls (for a modest fee) and there are a couple of small museums built in. Entry into the main area is free, and there are a couple of good art galleries, gift shops and a wonderful view - recommended."
A must visit in Nizhny!!,A must visit place. Even if you just roam around the place you will feel good. Evening is the best time to see the lighting and blue sky.
Must see,"Historical heart and most beautiful place in this wonderful city. Museums, panoramic view of Volga river, oldest building in the city - Kremlin wall. Take your time, go for a walk. Than to museums or one of the restaurants around."
Fine,The Kremlin is fine. You get an ok view and it's also possible to walk on the walls. We didn't do that since we thought the price was too much for that.
so much history here,We were lucky and had a local tell us about the history here and how this fort had been used in the past. Inside the Kremlin there are some military equipment and other WW2 items. Beautiful place to watch the sunset over the river Volga.
amazing,"expend good time here, walking,taking photos, visit small and old churche too, and all the monuments they have here in this area."
A must see in Moscow,What can you say that has not already been said.  This is one of Russia's most famous landmarks and something you have to experience.  It takes a few hours to get around and see it.  You should go a few times to experience this glorious landmark.
Astonishing View,The Kremlin is a must visit place in Nizhniy Novgorod. The view to the river as well as to the Stadium and the Cathedral is magnificent. Inside there will be military monuments and pleasant atmosphere where we met several locals and many visitors on the day prior to the quarter finals of the World Cup 2018.
Do The Wall Tour!,Interesting to walk around the grounds but to really get a good experience we recommend you do the not very expensive but most interesting and scenic tour of the Walls (trun right and go upstairs in the far corner).
great views,Walked all the way along the feeder street from Gor'kovskaya Metro station. Walk to the edge of the escarpment to get the best views of the rivers and the new stadium. There is an interesting collection of WWII weaponry- I think made from the many factories that made this city so important in Soviet times.
Ein MUSS / a must! ,"It's a very beautiful Kremlin environment with a breathtaking view on the Wolga and Oka tiver for free!!! Besides that, there are other interesting excibitions you won't regret to visit! Do that you won't regret!"
Guided walking tour of the walls and grounds ,"I enjoyed an excellent tour of this lovely site. Thank you to Tour Guide, Kate. You were very friendly and helpful. There are some fabulous views from up on the walls. It is well worth a visit."
Don’t miss the modern art center inside it!,"The Kremlin is the city’s main attraction although the area in itself consists mostly of rather uninteresting government buildings. You come here for the walls and towers, the spectacular view of the Volga (and Oka) , the amazing modern art museum Arsenal (one of the best in Russia) and the charming picture gallery. Take a walk around the walls. Come here to see the sunset or sunrise over Volga and don’t miss the modern art center Arsenal. Beside exhibitions it also has great movie screenings (sometimes original language) as well as the best souvenirs and gifts in town."
Scenic spot,Perhaps not as detailed as some of the other more famous kremlins in Russia but some great views nearby. It’s a long walk up the stairs from the river if you go that way but worth the hike.
Beautiful area for a stroll,The views across the Volga are superb at the eternal flame !  Especially at sunset !It's really a nice garden area with a gorgeous church in the middle.Being a bit of a history buff I enjoyed the display of WW2 equipment.A must see in Nizhny.  Beautiful city !
Nice architecture,"But I didn't have time to take a tour to learn more about it. Probably, it is worth taking a guided tour there."
A stroll on the Kremlin walls,The walk up along the walls of Kremlin are spectacular. The view over Volga is fantastic. The tour offers a nice insight into Russian history (without too much information. You can only do this with a tour guide). So worth the visit!
the walking tour,"any town steeped in history has amazing buildings, forts, castles, architecture or kremlins..Nizhny Novgorod doesn’t disappoint.On top of a hill overlooking the Volga sits Nizhnys Kremlin.. standing since 1515 and occupying 2.2 sq kms, this fort like structure gave the town its defence.. formerly of wooden structure till the early 1500s.It’s striking reddish earth appearance can be seen for miles..Guarded and connected by 13 towers each named.Access can be made via the bottom of the hill or thru the Main Street atop.Access around the kremlin can be made all day long, some steps have been made..This would be stunning with winter snow..A worthy late afternoon stroll accompanied with a sunset or a morning educational treat"
A marble of the city,"When I was young, I was spending hours inside the Kremlin. There are so many hidden spots to explore. A few years ago there were a couple of hidden ways inside the walls and on top of the roofs of the walls. Also, there are dozens of tunnels underneath the ground of Kremlin, who knows what is going on in the deepest parts of them?"
A very nice view of the 2 important rivers encounter,"Is very worth a tour at the place ... WWII weapons , a memorial to the fallen heroes , a historical construction mixed with the today center of the political power in the region ."
A fantastic place to visit..,"This is a lovely place to visit especially to appreciate the view of the Volga river, the eternal flame and the WW2 memorial. There are also some nice exhibits of well preserved WW2 military equipment and excellent wall murals dedicated to the local hero's of the Great Patriotic War  (1941-1945). Our visit was made even more special due to the fact that the rehearsals for the 2018 Victory Day parade were taking place just outside the Kremlin wall. At the end of the parade, we walked back to our cruise boat passing the monument to the famous aviator Valery Chkalov. At this point, there are spectacular views of the Volga from the staircase which descends to the river embankment. Overall, I found Nizhny Novgorod a lovely place a visit. It left a lasting impression of a place which I would love to return to again in the future."
Great place ,"Such a good place to see. Memorial fire, city view (you can see the new football stadium), Soviet tank T-34 and other World War weapon"
Walls,First of all you need to attend walls. From them opens the view to historical part and rivers. Also there are few little museums in towers across the wall.
State Museum of Art ,Wonderfull museum of Russian art with some good examples of European Art. From medieval icons to Contemporary. Rotari to Rapin to Kandinsky. Guided tours also in English. The museum curators and staff are very nice and kind.
MUST SEE,"The center attraction of the city. To reach it, you take the metro and then have a long walk through the beautiful street of Gorskaya (excuse my spelling). Many things to see inside: a small Church, the Mayor office, statue of soldiers, Tanks and old war artillery ...The view of the Volga is also amazing. Be careful it is always colder and more windy there since it is on a hill."
Very interesting and great for photos!,"I found the Kremlin one of the most interesting places I visited during my time in Moscow. There is a lot to take in, certainly take your camera!"
impressive landmark which you cannot miss,"Kremlin strategically situated at riverside, overlooking Volga- and Oka River coming together.well preserved, open for walking around. from up there you also see the World Cup stadion, currently still under construction for upcoming summer.don't miss this historical landmark!"
Amazing,Sceneries are damn beautiful eye catching and soothing.  A very good amazing place to visit and are extremely fantastic.
A visit for life,"I grew up in an apartment with a view overlooking the Kremlin. I would say it's part of my identity. The way it slopes with the landscape, so great, so large and massive but at the same time fragile because it's only man-made. Of course, I am very sentimental about the Kremlin but think that that is the best way to go about it: its walls have witnessed hundreds of years worth of history and tell the story eloquently if you're willing to listen. :)"
Must see Tourist Spot in Nizhny Novgorod!,"Don't miss it... It's a must see... If you are a fan of history and appreciate monuments, it's a must... Tribute to war veterans and the inextinguishable fire are highlights..."
Not as impressive as in Moscow,"The Kremlin in Nizhniy Novgorod is not as impressive as in Moscow but it is definitely worse visiting. If in Moscow you have to take a metro and go to Red square to see the Kremlin, in Novgorod you do not have to go anywhere. If you walk in the city center, you should see the Kremlin. The most beautiful part is Dmitrievskaya tower."
Not a big tourist attraction ,"You may end up a bit disappointed if you think you will see anything that can match with the Kremlin in Moscow. Most buildings are offices used by the government, with just one or two churches worth visiting. Nevertheless, you will be rewarded with a nice stroll, hardly any tourists and no entrance fees."
A must-see site,Great place to visit and feel the ancient builders and warriors spirit. It has outstanding viewing spot over Volga and Oka rivers.
Great historical feature,"Like be the Kremlin in Nizhny, great in summer.there are museums inside, the staff are friendly and helpful."
"The ""Heart"" of Nizhniy",A great view from the river or from the street on top of the bluff - I recommend a car be used. It is a complete ancient Kremlin with WW II memorabilia displayed inside. It is still the center of city administration.
Check out the tulips at the Kremlin!,"The tulips added so much to an already great visit to the Kremlin. Between the flowers and the great view of the Volga river, it was a great photo opportunity."
An impressive structure,The Kremlin is well worth a visit as it gives you an opportunity to view stunning vistas. The walk around the ramparts is not for the unfit as it has many high steps to negotiate but the walk gives you the chance to see many stunning views. There are a few side rooms along the way to visit to see some military paraphernalia. There are many military vehicles and hardware inside the Kremlin for the young to clamber over and enjoy. There are also poignant collages of individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice in earlier military conflicts.
Kremlin at Nizhny Novgorod,"The Kremlin would disappoint you if you are looking for any comparison with the Kremlin at Moscow. But, in a place like Nizhny Novgorod, it is worth visiting once...since there are not many sightseeing places here. There is an old church in its premises...which has a nice ambience."
Impressive!!,"In 2016 I was heading to Joshkar-Ola between Moscow and the Urals, to visit a Danish friend who lives there now. So Nishniy Novgorod was an obvious city to visit and overnight.The city is beautiful in itself, located at that magnificent river Volga - but the visit at the fortress is a must, if going to this city. It's spectacular and also gives a grand view of the city centre and the river."
Sunny day,"If you stay in Nizny you must see Kremlin walls. Beautiful view on river from top. A lot of people there on a walk, to caught some fresh air."
Great Photos ,"If you're here as a tourist, then you must visit this place. The view at the end was incredible, even as cold and windy as it was, I still got lots of great photos as memories from here."
vist to Nizhny Novgrod Kremilin,visiting from New Zealnd have found the city stunnig in winter. we walked the length of the main streat to the Kremlin fantastic place old military equipment the eternal flame site and walking around outer wals it is a great structure. you can pay 200 RUB to walk two sections along the battle ment and at the end is a museum small but interestig history take your google ap translate it is all in russian. they are passionate about there history. it is well worth a visit
Nice Architecture & Landscape,"A piece of good architecture in the middle of city an historic place to visit. U can easily approach any entrance of the Fort along the river side or the city, i had witness a tram crossing one of the Gates."
The Kremlin is a cultural mix of architectural and historical witnesses,I wonder that the Arsenale inside the Kremlin is not even mentioned in any of Tripadvisors reviews. The Arsenale certainly belongs architectonically to the best museums of contemporary art worldwide. It took more than 12 years to refurbish these former stables and warehouses into this great art place. The Kremlin is administrated from the central ministry of culture in moscow and has therefore great pieces of the governments collection available. Also the State Museum of Fine Arts is inside Kremlin and has a great collection of russian paintings...
Good and long,"One of the biggest castles in Russia,a nice and beautiful one,prepare for a very long walk with stairs and exciting views"
good to walk aboat,"It is a #1 must-see in N/Novgorod. Good to walk both inside the wall and around the wall outside the Kremlin and on the wall as well. There's very nice modern art museum Arsenal and Beautiful Art Museum (Khudozhestvenny Muzey)  as well/ Kids will enjoy climbing on military vehicles of WWII. It would be nice to stop by Arkhangelski Church (one of the oldest at the territory of N/Novgorod). what I love the most is be staying at the observation point near Vechny Ogon' and staring at the junction of Volga and Oka, called Strelka. If you walk to the lower part of the Kremlin you will find another museum devoted to the city history which is nice to visit also."
"Good, but if you're a foreigner...","It's a beautiful Kremlin,  good views but almost no information in english. You can see a plane, tanks and cars used on ww2."
A must-see place if you go to Nizhny Novgorod,An ancient fortress from 14th century on a high hill overlooking river Volga. In addition to the fortress there is a memorial with eternal flame for victims of WWII and an exhibition of military equipment produced in the city during that period.
Impressive ,Very interesting place with lots of history behind it Nizhniy is actually the city you should go when visiting Russia as it is very different from Moscow or St Petersburg and you will be exposed to more realistic but yet very pretty way Russians live outside the two capitals
Nice view ,"Beautiful view over Volga. We went here a sunny day and I think thats the best to see the beauty in it. Everything was explained in russian tho, so for me who was a tourist I did not ger much."
Wondering around to find this amazing place full of history!,"A great place to visit when in this town - go both family or being solo! Full of history, the place honours the heroes who died for freedom in the WW I&II - it is really beautiful! You can also visit Arsenal museum or get down to the river side!"
It is Breathtaking! A must-see!,"An guided tour would be hardly interesting for foreigners, but highly intriguing for Russians. You can walk up the tower wall for some 1.5 km - a rare opportunity.Anyway, do come here in the evening of a hot summer day to witness a mesmerizing sunset."
So-so,"When compared to the Kremlin in Moscow or in Kazan, it's not very impressive but it offers fantastic photo opportunities of the Volga River!"
A must in Nizhny Novgorod,"You will find a kremlin in several russian cities. The kremlin in Nizhny Novgorod is a must. A lot of interesting buildings and exhibitions. And I love the little chapel in the middle. If you are lucky, there might be a mass."
Intersting Site With a Suprising Variety,The Kremlin itself is a fascinating structure and contains a range of interesting objects many tied to the 1941/1945 war. There are spectacular views over the river and the plain beyond.
Beautiful Kremlin,"We've seen many kremlins on our tour of Russia so far, and this was our favourite! Nizhny's Kremlin offers a lot to see and do, with memorials to WWII, various military vehicles, and a walk of the Kremlin wall. Start this from Dmitry's tower. It's 200 rubles per ticket. We liked it although the best view was actually from nearby the eternal flame (and therefore free of charge!)"
One of the best preserved Kremlins in Russia.,Definitely the place worth to visit in NN. Apart of nice looking walls and towers (some of them you can visit) there are few old churches and interesting exhibition of Soviet military vehicles.
"To visit is important, it is the core!","The Kremlin Nizny Novgorod is the center of the city, hence the story of the settlement went! Wall - is the story. Several streets converge at the point where the Kremlin as the Rays, then there are a couple of areas, excellent view of the merger of the Oka and Volga rivers, definitely - a place for a fort and a monastery was chosen not by chance that in the Middle Ages! On the opposite side of the Oka seen the famous Nizhny Novgorod Fair. Inside there is a cafe, pay toilets, exhibition of paintings, garden. There are several commercial exhibitions and museums, one of them free - an exhibition on the street - it's military exhibits local military products factories from World War II, there is even a part of the submarine! State architecture is quite good, some restored steam tower Kremlin closed for repairs, you can walk free and go through all the Kremlin in another way. There is also the shortcomings, the Kremlin area is large, but the surcharge is only one toilet and poorly marked, to the historical church was demolished inside and set the party center, an expensive admission ticket! Why: ""just walk through the protective wall"" is 260 rubles, and closed 17-00 ?! Inside the ancient walls is a modern settlement administration - why not moved to a different place ?! Drinks all here inside the Kremlin - is very expensive. But there is a shop with souvenirs and postcards. I recommend interesting!"
one of the more interesting Kremlins around,"Although it has largely been restored and may thus not be as old as some other Kremlins around, its location and large castle like structure make it a definite go-to destination"
Feel The Power!,"The power of the Kremlin shoots over the big Red Wall that encompasses the giant building. I suggest if you want to see the actual Kremlin, to cross the bordering bridge and go uphill a little in order to see over the wall. The walk around the wall is lovely on it's own but fairly hard to see anything when you are so close."
A great medieval fortress,"if you visit Nizhniy Novgorod, you probably do it for this place. Walk the walls, around the towers, enjoy the view from inside towards Volga and the city, descend towards the lower embankment and the related churches and monuments there, and look how the changes of times have transformed a great place in sometimes not-so-great from. Although this is part of the history, too... Still, a must-see. Just be warned, do not smoke nearby eternal fire - misbehaving there is fined."
Amazing view,We visited the Kremlin recently and as it was mid winter a few shops and such were closed. However we walked around the walls and finally ended up at the WW2 memorial looking over the vast view of the Volga and beyond. Absolutely stunning. The Kremlin was very interesting as is the whole city.
Romantic,"Great view. City, Volga. It's very romantic and wonderful place. Must visit. One of the best places in N.N."
Old walls,You cannot miss Kremlin when in Nizhny Novgorod. It sits on a hill and you get some great views for the walls. Walking around is nice. You can go inside as well though not much to see. But I liked it better than the Kremlin in Moscow. Not full of crowds and changing guards was more enjoyable.
nice area,"it was quite cold when we visited, so we spent only 45 minutes outside and then entered a coffee shop for warm tea and coffee.  Nice exhibition of WW2 weapons.  You should not allocate more than 2 hours for this."
Moscow Russia,"Starting with Kremlin, you can proceed to Annunciation Cathedral, Cathedral Of Assumption Alexandrovsky Gardens, Kremlin Armoury, Lenin Museum, St.Basil's Cathedral.Next Day only, Novospassky Monastery, All Russian Decorative Art Museum, State Historical Museum, State Museum Of Original Art Gorky memorial Museum,you have done justice to your visit.& Yet again , I was lucky to find a most friendly cabbie, Jassor-8968501680, who with little English & collection of 300 + hindi songs (The lyrics comes in English ,with Video-so they understand the drama & passion & can enact with joy), my day went too fast. It was not business for him,but sheer sincerity,  It was "" From Russia With Love ""  for me, totally memorable..."
Good views and a nice park; architecturally not very special,"Although its position, high above the Volga river, is impressive, thebuildings in the compound are not very special. With its greenery it'sa nice plays to walk around and enjoy the views. Parts of the walls canbe visited for a fee."
The most amazing place!,"We spent a fantastic day exploring the Kremlin complex. It was a long-held ambition to do so & we were, perhaps, a little concerned that it might not live up to expectations, but thankfully we were wrong - it was absolutely  wonderful. We especially wanted to see the churches within the complex, so we concentrated on visiting the Cathedral of the Archangel where there are many tsars' tombs, the Cathedral of the Annunciation & the Cathedral of the Dormition where Tsars were crowned. They are all highly decorated with frescoes, iconostasis (walls full of icons) & many other treasures, & in each Cathedral we found a good information sheet in English which helped to explain what we were seeing (they had them in several other languages too). We were very impressed by these interiors but just walking around Cathedral Square looking at the exteriors is a very rewarding experience because the cupolas looked spectacular & exotic. There are so many other things to see within the Kremlin complex including the Faceted Palace, the Arsenal, the Armoury, some collections of cannon, the Tsar's Bell & Cannon (which are both enormous!), & we also particularly enjoyed walking around the beautiful gardens. There are some very good views across the city from the Kremlin walls & the exit is extremely impressive too - we left via the Saviour's Tower which we thought was breath-taking. We knew beforehand that there would not be refreshments available within the Kremlin walls so we took some with us & would recommend that others do the same. We loved the whole experience & can't wait to go again."
What can you say.... It was the Kremlin,"We spend a day exploring the Kremlin.  One thing to remember when you plan this.  There is NO FOOD SERVICE anywhere in the Kremlin walls.  I suppose you could try and leave and then return, but we were not going to risk it!  It is a active current head of state with a lot going on.  Pay attention to the roads and cars!  Understand that nearly every building requires it's own ticket (each at a price).  Our philosophy was, we are here once, it is not the time to get to critical and just go for it!  More detail under specific buildings that are a must see (Amory and Diamond Fund, and Bell Tower)"
Quite a mixed bunch,"I was very surprise by the cumulative effect of what's known as Nizhny Novgorod's Kremlin. I've entered it through the steep road from the riverside - there are some interesting statues, but also a path in quite a state of disrepair. The landscape chanfes once you see all of the official buildings - grass is green, everything is neat and clean. And then you move to the Kremlin walls with tanks, airplanes and other war machinery on display, souvenir stalls, photo ops and museum. But the overall feel is positive and I praise the city for making its Kremlin a distinctive public space where locals go for a weeknd walk and brides frequent to have their picture taken there."
Nice place,"The territory is very nice and clean, but it is not very much to see hereYou can find on the territory only a monument with memorable fire"
Don't miss out,"Make sure you visit the Kremlin. See it on the outside, see it on the inside, and go trek the wall itself. Yes, it's hard, yes the stairs are huge, but its a beautiful historic landmark with very great views and very interesting information. Cheap too!"
Exciting place ,"If you are planning to visit Russia dont miss this place , real historical place with nice museum available with helpful people."
A great place to be,"We went to the Kremlin here in the evening. It was a beautiful walk near the embankment. Then we climbed the staircase photographing all the way. Once inside the Kremlin, the views of the city and the Riverside were breathtaking."
Not to be missed experience,"IT was our first trip to Moscow and The Kremlin.  It was more than I ever expected even after much reading and study.  It was almost an overwhelming experience after many years of planning this trip.  The Russian people  around this area were also interesting.  A mixed folk group tried to entertain but were chased away by the police.  They just smiled and moved on to another area where they were again chased away.   The cathedrals, shops, helicopters, etc. at the Kremlin were also interesting.  Best travel experience in along time."
spectacular fortress,"the second largest fortress in Russia, really well-preserved and with amazing views from the walls. several interesting museums in the towers, some beautiful monumemts and a Soviet era war memorial inside the fortress.  the best time to visit - definitely summer!"
They are spectacular in real life!,"Just avoid visiting the Kremlin at late November or the beginning of December, Because you wont see much and your visit will be useless, At that time the early preparation of Christmas began and all the place will be like a working location and it would be even hard to take photos specially in front of Moscow Mall.the picture you have of ""the Kremlin"" is actually a picture of St. Basil's cathedral. The Kremlin is the huuuuuuge building about 45 degrees to the right of this photo. Very different buildings, very different purposes and yet often mixed up. Regardless, go and see them. They are spectacular in real life!"
Great history and museum,The history is fascinating. It contains interesting Soviet era war memorials including an eternal flame for WWII. The view over the river is absolutely breathtaking. It is a wonderful place to walk around in.
A fortress in the heart of Nizhny Novgorod,Kremlin is a great opportunity to learn all about the history of Nizhny Novgorod. Real medieval fortress with accessible towers.
Beautiful Kremlin by Volga river,This Kremlin which is more than 500  years old is n beautifully located on the banks of River Volga. the brick architecture now houses goverment offices etc. Even from outside the look is magestic.  Inside the walls beautiful cathedrals are worth the view.
Real Russian place,Nice example of Russian medieval architecture. Not crowded with tourists as in Moscow for example. And really heartbreaking view at Oka's and Volga's connection - this is a must in Nizhniy.
Old Russia,"The scent of old Russia, a beautiful place by the river. A historical castle with a great view. WW2 tanks and cars in display, and pictures of war heroes by the wall. Really good souvenir shops with considerable prices. A very nice place to visit."
Beautifully kept medieval walled city fully of interest,"3 cathedrals in one tiny walled city, no vehicles on the roads, the largest bell in the world, the largest canon in the world and the prime ministers offices were just a few of the sights in this amazing area of Moscow and there is even a ""tame"" guard you can photograph in his smart Russian guard uniform. An enormous museum full of treasures (""The Arrmoury"") including some Faberge items and untold wealth.  A good visit."
Interesting place to visit.,"The Kremlin takes you right into the Olde Russia.The spirit of the entire place is like a fairy tale.The buildings are well-restored, There are many surprises within those walls,The Church, the Flame, the vistas are divine."
"a must see, not to be missed!","A visit inside the Kremlin is a must, if visiting Moscow. there is an entry fees to enter inside, but it is well worth the money. i was lucky enough to have a guide for my time inside which i would totally recommend, as you get to see a few little hidden gems and also get told information that is not on any of the fact sheets or guides that you can pick up as you go through the various buildings. the cathedrals within the grounds are stunning and every direction you look is full amazing buildings and gardens. the beautiful and detailed painted panels within the cathedrals are some of the most beautiful paintings i have ever seen. not all of the buildings are old and I was quite surprised at how modern some of them are. ne sure to walk through the gardens to the wall overlooking the river for some wonderful views over the city. a visit not to be missed!"
Must visit !,Very peaceful inside the walls with well maintained gardens. The view from the war memorial are superb and I liked the military display.A must see in Nizhny !
No worse than in Moscow,"I did not know that it was Buildt by Italian architects. In the arches of the fortress walls is noticeable. There is something to see:  the wall itself, the old buildings on the site and the exposure of military equipment of the 2nd World War."
Amazing Kremlin,The walls and towers of the Kremlin are very atmospheric and really do give the city a very special feel. Do not forget to walk the walls and to enjoy climbing on the old military vehicles parked inside the Kremlin grounds.
Huge castle with superb views.,"Just a nice place to spend a couple of hours, even with outdoor picninc with outstanding views. But not many really hisctoric sights there."
Superb place to visit with stunning views,This was a hi-light of my trip to this City. A nice place to walk around with stunning views across the rivers and the city. Only a few minutes walk from the main walking shopping street in the city.
Interesting history,"When in NN this is a must see. Does not compare to Moscow Kremlin, but the history is interesting.Try not to visit in winter for obvious easons."
Charmed,No queues. But the lady has not warned us that one kilometer that we would cover is not just even!But we should know better ourselves! This one km was an experience! So steep stairs I haven't seen anywhere! But what a thrill! One just understands that Kremlin has never been a museum - it was a fortress to make it tough to the enimy to capture! It was am experience notmany tourists dared to explore!
a fortress with historical museums,"In principle this Kremlin is nothing like the one of Moscow (which is good, otherwise no sense to see it), there is a park with Eternal Fire, good view over the river, some military machines (children love them!), all that is free. And if you pay some 150 RUB (approx 3 EU), you can stroll the walls and see some local history museums - they are small but give a nice overview of the subject. I also took a chance to shoot a crossbow and an old-fashioned bow ))))"
Must see the Armoury,"The kremlin compound houses the most historical buildings and sights in the city. A visit must include buying a ticket to the armoury. This addition is essential showcasing the best parts of Russian history. The weapons, carriages and suits of armour were a highlight. Without seeing this, there are only a few cathedrals to see. Take a guidebook or rent a guide and go early. The queues to get in are long!"
"Grim, but with beautiful churches.","Nothing gives more pleasure to the average Russian ticket seller or security guard than causing delay and general inconvenience to foreigners, unless it is to do the same to fellow Russians.  Getting into the Kremlin, like anywhere else in Russia, is to experience multiple queues and stupefying bloody-minded bureaucracy.  That said, the churches in the Kremlin are beautiful."
Unexpected surprise,"I liked the Kreml a lot, it has quite big territory. But the most unexprected and pleasant was the fact that in there was an exihibition of Aivazosvkiy those days - it as fantastic! The pictures which previously were in different places - and they were collected in one place - in one of beautiful buildings of Kreml."
Kremlin,"Kremlin is very beautiful and a ""must see"" in Nizhny! A magnificient view to rivers. There is an exhibition of military equiment (those, who want ti see the cars ""must"" visit the GAZ museum - a lot of interesting cars, produced in Nizhny). Kremlin is a good place for walking. And You'll be able to see ""russian tradition"" - personal car parking place for government."
Ancient fortress,Ancient fortress built in the early 16th century Italian master Peter Fryazin and restored in the mid-20th century architect Svetoslav Agafonov from Nizhny Novgorod. A chain of 13 different towers. You can walk around and explore the inside and outside.
Excellent view and feeling of ancient place,"Kremlin is the oldest structure in Nizhny Novgorod, over-viewing the confunction of 2 rivers: Oka and Volga. A must see in Nizhny Novgorod. You can also visit an expo site inside."
A Must Do in Moscow,"This little city within a city is a must do whilst visiting Moscow. There are a lot of buildings, mostly churches, inside that you can go in. We went in 3, which was enough. Don't miss the large bell and canon. The grounds are lovely and provide some excellent pictures over the wall across the city. It was cold but very sunny when we went there which provided us with excellent photos. The armoury is huge but a little dull until you get to the royal gowns and carriages.  The diamond room is excellent, remember to speak quietly to you get told off by the guards! A good tip is go straight to the diamond room, you can buy your ticket for the armoury as you come out, it saves going to the ticket booths."
One of the few nice places in Nizhny,"As a tourist visiting Nizhny there is no many places to visit, this is one of it, and I think it is the best, the Kremlin is a historical place but still being used by the Russian government till now, it has some old weapons and military trucks that have been used in the world war, it is like an open-air museum, also some old churches, nice and large garden that you can enjoy walking in, finally don't miss to enjoy the view of the river from the Kremlin north end, the view there is incredible."
Dispelling a lot of myths,"We visited The Kremlin in Moscow, that enclave of buildings, a small town overlooking the city.  I always thought it to be dark and forbidding but in August, it was sunny with some very beautiful buildings including several churches.  There was a green area, a park that was the best manicured garden in Moscow (not a great advertisement) with trees and benches.   The buildings were varied and interesting, and you can see where Mr. Putin works when he's in the city.  The tour was very interesting and changed a lot of my idea of the Kremlin."
Plenty of history,"Worth a visit, glad we had a tour guide to tell us all about the different things. Not a busting lot to see, there is a huge cannon and bell. Don't forget to keep to the paths or you will very quickly be told!!!"
The Kremlin,"Exciting view of the city from the Kremlin's walls and towers. But inside there are not so many interesting things to view - the old chirch, military vehicles and that's almost all."
Photographer scenery,"Summertime you may climb the Kremlin wall and walk along a good part of it, clicking panoramic pics of the city center , entrance thru second left  tower from the main (busstop)  Tower  (take 3rd floor tower Cafe staircase) , chargeable open till 5 pm"
"Kremlin, WW2 weapons, fine art useum","Nice place to spend couple of hours. It combines kremlin itself, outdoors WW2 military equipment exhibition, orthodox church building, art museum with 17-20 century paints and beautiful skyline which covers Oka and Volga merge with historical building.To see the beauty  of Kremlin it better to walk around outside kremlin. Nice view on couple of churches, roofs of old buildings. But this part is very windy in winter time, better to visit this place in spring-summer-early autumn.Inside kermlin every Friday and Saturday from 11am till 2-3pm you can see newly weds. They just walking inside the kremlin paying respect to war heroes, leaving big lock for luck and just enjoying the moment.  There are couple of WW2 cannons, t34 tanks, Katyusha firing station, truck, Il-2 aircraft, part of submarine. This is a main attraction for children. Not all machine are genuine WW2 items. Katyusha firing part is original but it stands on modern trunk, modified to look like old timer.Art museum itself could take 2-3 hours. If you keen on Russian painters you will like it."
I can't believe I am here,"The Kremlin, evokes  so many pictures and thoughts. What an incredible place, just to see it means so much to so many people. We went into one of the churches on the edge of the square and heard these three gentlemen singing, their voices reverberating around the space, we were overwhelmed by all the icons that were available to be looked at and admired. We were amazed at the faithful who come to venerate the reliquariesBeing able to display your religious feelings means so much to these people"
Well worth a visit,A historical Kremlin that is well worth a visit.  There's a beautiful green church in the centre of the Kremlin near the eternal flame.  There's many steps so be prepared for lots of walking and climbing.  It is very large and has many historical monuments around the Kremlin.
Fantastic look at old Russia,"Hundreds of years old, this is the seat of government within a fortress. Includes a military museum, monument to WWII, and beautiful architecture."
Good spot,Definitely wort having a look. On the yard are some fascinating  examples of second world war produced in NN.
Well mantained must see,Be prepared to sweat walking and climbing around but it well worth what you'll see! Well mantained beautiful property! Stunning views!
Small Kremlin,"Almost every city in Russian has a Kremlin. It was the original defense post during Medieval times. This one is small and dedicated to old Soviet war equipment. There are interesting artifacts to see but generally, it gets boring after 1 hour."
Walk the ramparts to get a different point of view,"The Kremlin in Nizhny Novgorod is a lovely spot to spend an hour or two. Yes there are the usual churches and souvenir stalls, but there's also the Arsenal - a museum of modern art - and several museums. It's got old military vehicles on display, even part of a submarine. On the river side there's a war memorial dedicated to WW2 in incredible Soviet style. Some entrepreneurial fellows will rent you an old Soviet military uniform and machine gun, so you too can pose by a tank. We walked the ramparts (fort walls) which offer a different point of view - especially of the Volga River - though beware, the stairs at the end on the river side are VERY steep. It is free to enter, though to visit the museums and even to walk the fort walls, there is a fee."
One of the nicest in Russia,Great place during summer with lots of areas and great views to the river. Makes this dull city much more interesting..
great historical place,"it smells of the history, nice museums, the great kremlin wall where you can walk around, great-great view where from you can observe all the city."
Wonderful,"A great place for enjoying the fantastic sights over the Volga, with access to the other popular areas. Limited access for disabled and pushchairs."
Beautiful panoramic views,This edifice is built high on a hill in central Nizhny Novgorod overlooking the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers.  There is a beautiful staircase leading up the hill from the river as well as many other ways to get to the Kremlin(streets that are steep and other smaller stairways). Once up there you have great views of the city and rivers. There are interesting sites atop the hill in and around the kremlin walls. An eternal flame reminds you of the Great Patriotic War (WWII) by a memorial wall.  The atmosphere is park-like.  An old Russian tank is on display near the war memorial. A good way to spend an afternoon when the weather is nice
Located on the Volga. Great Views in the summer.,"The Kremlin located on the Volga River. The place is clean, and has great views of the River. Enjoyable particularly in the summer. In Winter, the endless ice river is also good to view. One of the places where we can take good photos."
the best Kremlin in Russia,Oka plus Volga (greatest Russian river) plus Kremlin - the view is breathtaking at any time of day and night especially in summer
typical Russian views,typical Russian castle. Few monuments. Clean and tidy (most probably due to govener residence is there). Free to attend.
One of the nicer kremlins I saw in Russia,"a really nice kremlin to visit, with a view to the Volga and the federal museum of modern art ""Arsenal"" - a must!"
Tiger,"The Kremlin opens out into a very big space with old WW2 millitary hardware on show including a couple of T34 tanks, a Katushya rocket launcher and subamrine conning tower.  The museum was good although ramparts closed until the weather improves, very atmospheric especially in the snow!!"
It's a real fort!,"NN Kremlin used to serve as a real military fort, unlike Moscow Kremlin that was only a decoration.The walk on the wall is a must. Just imagine: these stones are over 500 years old!.. Well, at least many of them :-)"
Breath-taking view,"The view on the Volga from the Kremlin is great ! At sunset it's unbelievable. The buildings in the Kremlin are pretty, the walk is nice, in the weekends you can see brides and grooms having their picture taken. It's a really nice place to think, relax (when it's not too cold...) and an amazing history.The Kremlin was 1st built in the 12th century I think, first out of wood, then bricks. It has hosted some famous people - generals, emperors, inventors - it represents the strength of Russia, has a monument for the soldiers, an eternal flame, statues ... you should have a guide when you walk around."
