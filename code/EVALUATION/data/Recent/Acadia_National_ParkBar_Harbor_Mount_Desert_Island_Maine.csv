Breathtaking,"My wife and I recently traveled to this amazing National Park. There is something to do for everyone in the family. Bike riding, kayaking , hiking ,golfing, horseback riding and more. I only wished we had allotted more time to spend there"
One of the great national parks,"A lovely part of the world, with great hiking, beautiful vistas, lakes, and a great town (Bar Harbor) nearby.  A must visit."
Pretty park,Nice park. Loop takes you 27 miles around. I wasn’t that wowed though. Colorado is much more dramatic
Wonderful- be sure to catch the sunrises on Cadillac mountain,"We enjoyed our time here and there was something for everyone in our family from easy walks to Otter cove to more difficult trails, like Precipice and Beehive. Be sure to catch a few sunrises from Cadillac mountain- arrive at least 45 minutes before sunrise in order to secure parking and a place to view. We saw dolphins from the Schooner Head overlook, so pack some binoculars. The Ocean Path walk was the most beautiful to me because of the water. The 27 mile park loop drive is a nice way to get your bearings on Day 1 and then plan your adventures, or if you don't want to hike you can just drive and park along the way to catch many of the main sights. There are plenty of areas to pull over and catch the views and several parking areas that fill up quickly. The Jordan Pond House is a nice place to take a break. Enjoy!"
Amazing views,"As a family tradition, we have been visiting Mid- Maine every summer for over 15 years.  This is the first time we ventured further up north and visited Acadia National Park. The views were breathtakingly beautiful. They have marked spaces on the side of the road where we parked and took pictures. It was pretty steep driving up Cadillac Mountain but we were ok with that. The thickets were very reasonable and good for 5 days."
Always a gem of a park,"I haven't been to Acadia in years and yet I felt right at home when I returned. It is such a wonderful, accessible park and you can travel through it anytime-it is open 24 hrs however, you cannot camp or spend the night in the park. I went up to Cadillac mountain at night and enjoyed the stars and did day hikes. It never disappoints."
Beautiful,$30 to get in for 1 car lasts you a week. Well worth it. Beautiful  scenery and plenty of hikes. Parking is tight in the lots but plenty of parking g on the right hand side of the road. How can you not give it 5 stars?
Never tire of it.,Were surprised by how many people were there in Sept. We usually go in August but you can still lose yourself in the park. We never tire of the views and just sitting on the rocks past thunder hole.
Acadia National Park,"We loved the whole park , but we just did a few of the get out of your vehicles areas and experience the area first hand. Some of the ones we did were  Cadillac Mountain, Sand Beach , Thunder Hole . We will be back to see more."
Breathtaking Acadia!,"This park has been on our National Parks bucket list and it did not disappoint!    From the breathtaking Cadillac Mountain to the gorgeous beaches and trails , there is so much to see and do.  There are maps and information at the visitors center provided by the park rangers outside."
Brilliant! A must visit! ,"Acadia is breathtaking no matter what time of day you go. I went in the afternoon and during sunset to Cadillac Mountain. The air is so clean, fresh and there is some great history to learn about the park itself."
Wonderful Park!,"We loved our first visit to Acadia! We enjoyed the scenery, Cadillac Mountain, Sandy Beach & the various scenic points to see the ponds."
Worth the $30 entry,"This park is full of scenic trails and beautiful  things to see with many photo opportunities. Note that the road is one way only, so don't miss a stop."
A Little for All to Enjoy (After Lines for a Permit),"Tide Pooling was great - 1.5 Hours Before til 1.5 Hours After Low Tide.  During covid, give yourself an extra hour to get a park pass at the office, there was a single file outside with only one register issuing passes indoors.  And, a separate line for information too, so you'll be in line twice.  Or you can get your pass online.There are a couple of places to do tidal pooling, one is at Bar Harbor in the town and there is national park permit parking just as you enter town, but otherwise it is all metered.  The other place to see tidal pools was a 30-40 minute drive from the park HQ, so if you want to go there, then you'll really have to go early to get your pass and drive across the park.We were able to see while flipping rocks... small and large crabs, starfish stuck to the bottom of rocks, a sea urchin, tiny shrimp, mussels, and a lot of live sand dollars.  The tide goes out and comes in quick so you only have 1.5 hours before and after the low tide, and don't get trapped out on the island if you walk to it.We then drove the rest of the park for some really great views of the landscape, sat on the beach for a while, and enjoyed the fresh air.  The park was busy throughout, even with covid, but still very beautiful.  Lots of hiking trails for those who love to trek.   Take a day minimum on your trip to visit this wonderful park."
Gorgeous ,"This park was on my wife’s bucket list. We spent two days at the park and it is absolutely beautiful! Due to COVID, things were a little bit tricky. They would only allow so many people into each building and most of the exhibits were closed. Even with all of that, this park is amazing just for the natural beauty and great trails."
Fabulous,"nd BeachFirst time to this national park- with Covid many things were restricted but we drove the entire loop road, saw Thunderhole and Sand Beach, took short hikes, watched sunset atop of Cadillac Mountain and attended a fantastic ranger program on the night sky. An amazing visit with nature and beauty."
Acadia National Park 25 years later.,We've been following CDC precautions for Covid 19 prevention. We realized Maine and our state have very low infection rates. We found the Park staff to be wonderful. We felt for the second week in September the park seemed crowded. But then the majority of schools are closed and teaching remotely so families took advantage of the glorious weather. In the park it seemed women and children all wore masks and approximately 35 % of the men did not.
so much beauty,"First of all, you will need to spend more time here than you think.  There is so much to see and do even during the pandemic.  We hit trails everyday and didn't come close to doing as much as I would have liked in the 6 days there.  The trails are incredibly maintained with evidence of well-planned labor for hikers enjoyment and safety.  The views from all of the mountain summits are the BEST payoff for easy-moderate hikes.  If you're used to hiking 1,500ft or more, you'll find these hikes on the easy side.  Don't miss Thunder Hole, Cadillac Mountain, Bubble Rock and Jordan Pond."
Lots to do,We bought a CD of the 27-mile loop and enjoyed the nature that this national park offers. The Rangers were friendly and answered all of our questions.
A Dream to Visit,"One of the best places I have ever visited.  Such untouched beauty everywhere.  Plenty of places to hike, easy and more advanced trails.  Great sign posts to follow, if you love nature you won't be disappointed.  Safe travels!"
Beautiful well maintained park,It is so worth visiting the park.  We took A 4 hour bus tour that was so worth it. Then we went back on our own to visit areas of interest. This is a MUST DO.
it wasnt my favorite park,"i mean there are a few things to see, thunder hole, which you  have to go at the right tide or its just rocks and a staircase,sand beach is there, very clean water beach and cadilac mountain has nice views but i wasnt highly impressed"
Nature at its best,"A breath taking view in every direction. Mother nature at her very best. Surrounded by water, pine trees and rocks in all shapes and sizes and a mountain to top it off. There was so much to do and see. The park is open 24 hours so the views are ever changing with lights and darks. Acadia National Park was such a wonderful experience for the entire family. The best part it was all natural. I can't wait to visit again real soon."
Best Scenery in the Northeast,"Growing up in the northeast and having lived here for over 40 years, I can honestly say that Acadia National Park has some of the absolute best scenery in the region.  From 1,500 foot Cadillac Mountain to the incredible tree lined, rocky coasts, to the epic Jordan Pond, Acadia boasts nature with a capital ""N.""We absolutely loved our time in Bar Harbor, during which we visited Acadia on 5 different days.  Loved Otter Cliffs, Sand Beach, and Thunder Hole 2 hours before high tide is truly something special."
Amazing sites,So much to see and photo opportunities around every corner. I completely understand why Acadia is listed as the #1 Park in the US. Absolutely stunning! Highly recommend!
A must visit park in Maine,A beautifully Serene park. Must see is sunrise at Cadillac mountain and the Beehive summit trail hike. You can stroll on the Ocean path trail and enjoy the nature.
Acadia National Park. Beautiful trip! Don’t miss it if you travel to Maine,"Places to go: Bar Harbour, Thunder Hole and Otter CliffIn Bar Harbour don’t miss the Harbour. The best moment to see the Thunder Hole is when is high tide or stormy. The Otter Cliff is not well signed on the Park. You will find a parking slot and the road splits in two. Park there. And go to the lane to see the Cliff. If you missed you can continue and later you will find a sign to the right. I’m telling you this because we missed."
Biking on Carriage Roads is fantastic,"The carriage roads are fantastic for cycling!  Wide, well maintained and not heavily used.  Be sure you have a plan before accessing them as they can be confusing.  I used the book Carriage Roads by Diana Abrell along with a map to plan our days biking and the book was invaluable.  The key is to know the number of the intersection so you can determine which way to go.  We spent 2 days biking and were able to cover all of the carriage roads in 2 days."
Spectacular Park,Love this National Park so much.  It offers stunning views of the ocean and miles and miles of well groomed trails for hiking and biking and even horseback riding.
Totally Worth the the 8 hour drive to get there,"This place was amazing. Dont rush through the park, i spent 3 days there. Take it in slowly and enjoy the scenes. Sand Beach, The Bubble, Thunder Hole and Cadillac Mountain. The view from Cadillac Mountain evoked for us views of Santorini.I cannot say enough about this place. My only mistake was waiting so long to come here, dont make this mistake, if you are on the bubble about going here. DO IT and make sure you do about 3 days, dont rush it"
Amazing views,Acadia is so beautiful. We did the walk around Jordan Pond. Absolutely worth the three mile hike. The next day we woke up early to see the sunrise. Maine is one of the first to see the sunrise. Get there early to get a good place to park. So many great places to view the sunrise. It was the most amazing experience ever.
Great trails and Nature's Beauty at Acadian National Park,"Acadia was beautiful with it's mix of dense forest and ocean views.  We are not avid hikers, and I love the water, so we took the Ocean trail, which I loved.  You go from Sand Beach and there are lots of great views.  Thunder Cove comes along, and even though conditions weren't right for it's loud thunder, you could still hear neat sounds.The carriage trails offer less populated walks.  I really liked Otter Cliff, too, for great views.Parking near Jordan Pond restaurant was a mess, but we enjoyed the popovers and surprisingly delicious lobster stew.  The drive up Cadillac Mountain is exciting and full of natures beauty.  Once up the mountain, there's parking, and lot's of exploring to do.  The idea that this was once lava is mind blowing, and the views of the Harbor and ocean breath taking.We did Acadia in a day, which is all we had. While we got a good taste of it and enjoyed the beauty, there's so much left for another visit, but nice to know we could have a great taste."
Great vacation spot ,"Acadia was a wonderful experience for us. I hope enjoyed the national park and all its wonders including Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole and Sand beach. The scenery during our visit was outstanding. Every direction you looked it was like a postcard. Parking tends to get tricky so arrive very well, especially near Jordan Pond. Many great hiking trails for all levels."
Can’t go wrong here!,AMAZING views and hiking! Make sure to get to the areas early or you definitely wont get a parking spot in most places. Especially Jordan Pond. We had to circle the parking lot about 8x like sharks before we lucked out and scored a spot.
wonderfull!,"We love traveling to National Parks and Acadia certainly didnt disappoint. The shoreline is breathtaking and the outdoor activities are limitless. You must take in a sunrise over the ocean and our daughter who is a photographer introduced me to a moon rise where we watched the full moon come up over the ocean and it was as good or better than the sunrise. We hiked up challenging trails to mountaintops and took a carriage ride on Rockefeller's  roads. There are easy hikes and hard ones, mountain biking, walking, picnicing, carriage rides, something for everyone!"
Beautiful Trails for Everyone ,"Acadia National Park has scenic trails for people of all ages and skill level. For easier trails, walk the Jordan Pond Loop and the Ocean Path (both very popular). Some more challenging trails are the Beehive Trail (very popular), Precipice (most dangerous), the Bubbles, and Beech Mountain (less crowded). Cadillac Mountain is the “must-see” of the Park, and you can drive or hike to the top any time of day: sunrise, sunset, daytime, or midnight, all for amazing views. The climate in Acadia is enjoyable as well: it rarely passes 78 degrees and is never too humid. Acadia is a wonderful place to visit, but be sure to plan your trip to arrive early because parking can be a very stressful experience if you come at prime time. Acadia is also wonderful because just ten minutes down the road is the town of Bar Harbor, with restaurants and shops, so if you aren’t planning on camping in the park, you can easily drive in and out from a comfy hotel."
"So much to do, no matter what you are looking for","I enjoyed the park VERY MUCH. Be sure to start with obtaining the map and researching some ""must see""s. Otherwise, you might end up circling around for days and miss some amazing things this park is full off. Must start your day super early, unless you like crowds and traffic."
Best National park!,"Heavenly! This is where you can see the first bit of morning light on the Eastern coast of the US!  The sunsets are spectacular as well, and don’t forget the incredible star gazing!"
Just Gorgeous!,"Absolutely beautiful site. Loved everything about it. From Jordan Pond to Sand Beach to Cadillac Mountain to the Bubbles to the hiking trails and carriage roads, every single aspect was incredible. We were there four days and we needed four more...months!"
One of the most amazing places in the northeast,"My wife and I were amazed by this park. Seeing the ocean, the woods and the mountains was amazing.Make sure you go up to Cadillac Mountain and walk the loop. Also go back for the sunset."
Stupendously beautilul National Park,"Acadia is a really beautiful park to visit, Huge numbers of varied & exciting hiking trails, water sports, rock climbing, swimming etc. The views from the top are incredible. Don't forget to visit Cadillac Mtn at dawn to see the sunrise at dusk for the sunset or at night to see the stars!!! A wonderful experience - to be repeated without moderation!!"
Must visit,"The park is spectacular.  Aside from the natural beauty of Maine, and visiting a place where the forest quite literally meets the ocean, great care has been taken to honor the aesthetic of nature.  No concrete or painted finishes on the drive around - all granite blocks for traffic control, beautifully built bridges.  Really great to see.  Be aware that while they tell you it's only 56 steps to the visitor center, those steps are stairs - so be in shape!"
Gorgeous vistas,"The park has nothing but beautiful views. There are hiking trails for every ability. If you can’t hike, you can drive through and still see the sights. Lack of parking is the only drawback. They do allow street parking in some areas due to overfilled lots. Bathrooms are open during Covid. Some other buildings are not."
A must if you like nature ,Go early as parking lots fill up quickly. Bike Riding the carriage roads is a must. Great hikes but easy ones get busy so don’t forget your mask.
Views and Activities,"This National Park is worthy of a visit.  It is very close to Bar Harbor.  There is something for everyone whether you like lakes, mountains or bike trails.  Parking can be an issue, but it depends on your timing.  So many natural wonders to enjoy.  Tip:  Some of the outlooks are  magnificent."
So much to see,We visited Acadia  during COVID-19. The amount of tourists during this visit  was crazy. More than we have ever seen in previous visits. So many areas to explore and see. Bring your camera! Sunrise and sunset at the summit of Cadillac Mountain are beautiful . Pop overs and jam at the Jordan Pond House. Thunder Hole and so much more.
Beautiful rocky coastline,"Awesome views of the beautiful rocky coastline. Fun trails for all types of hikers. We stayed 4 nights and did a lot - We hiked the Cadillac Summit, Ocean Path, Jordon Pond Path, South Bubble, Shore Path, Ship Harbor, Bass Head Lighthouse. Great place to explore!"
"Amazing, relaxing place to visit","We had an amazing visit at Acadia. There is so much to offer everyone. We did biking on the carriage roads, we hiked around Jordan Pond, we drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain and much more. The stars at night were insane. Can't get much closer to nature than this."
A fantastic place to visit,"I love the park. My advice is to purchase and print your pass before going. Skip the Sand beach entrance and head to the top to avoid lines. If you need a pass or forget to print it, Sand beach entrance is where you have to go. This year the only plus was a lot less people than any years past."
Beautiful and Rejuvenating,"ANP was just what we needed amid the COVID 19 craziness. The park offered so many different types of trails from  more in-land forested trails and hikes to many coastal hikes. The kids (5 & 8 yo) loved scrambling up and down the rocks, searching tide pools and looking for wildlife. We spotted a few deer on our morning hike to Bar Island, saw a fox, frogs, and signs of beavers at work. The rangers were helpful and encouraging to the kids as they worked on their jr ranger badges. We missed being able to get immersed and learn more history with some of the museums and visitor center movies... will just have to come back when everything is fully open. Try to see some of the sky at night... from the top of Cadillac, not only could we see the milky way, planets, stars and shooting stars, we were also treated to the beautiful chorus of blinking lighthouses at night from the surrounding islands... so fun to try to guess which we had visited or identified earlier in the day!A real treasure."
Covid Vacation,Wow. Go. Just Go. See it all. Bring your bikes and a camera. It’s glorious. You can drive to the summit of Cadillac Mountain which is nice. The carriage trails are fabulous on bike.  Big hills. Punishing hills. Worth it for the ride down. Bubble pond is beautiful..perfect place for a kayak ride. Acadia is the best of both worlds..water and trees. The loop is one way so be careful not to miss the sites. Otherwise you have to drive ALL the way around to come back. That sucks.
Amazing hiking in beautiful summer weather,Moderate level hiking. Rocky and some vertical trails. Bowl Trail amazing. Wear sunscreen! The overlook of Newport Cove is majestic and peaceful.
Beautiful!,We loved our visit to Acadia.  So beautiful and peaceful!  We had time to sit and meditate at Jordan Pond and my husband got to see the sunrise at Cadillac Mountain.
One of the most beautiful National Parks I've been to!,"What a stunning place is Acadia National Park! From high peaks to crystal clear lakes to rugged coastlines - it has it all. Even if you don't hike, just the drive through Acadia is incredibly scenic, with stunning views and photo opportunities around every corner. There are many places around Acadia worth stopping for - like Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Sandy Beach, Thunder Hole or Bass Harbor Lighthouse. You can drive up to almost all of these stunning places, just arrive early for available parking - especially on weekends. I would recommend this beautiful National Park to any nature lover."
Breathtaking,"I wish we had another week to explore this amazing park. There was something for everyone in our group to enjoy, from the many pull offs for those in our group with bad knees to take in the beauty without too much walking, to countless opportunities to hike and climb and explore at every skill level. Absolutely worth the drive up the coast."
Not to be missed!,"If you come to Bar Harbor there is no excuse to either hike, bike or drive along the park. Beautiful views along the way. Not to be missed is Cadillac Mountain- view is spectacular! There are some easy walks or hikes for people of all ages. Biking is protected-no cars, which is nice."
Beautiful National Park!,My friends and I took a drive through the park and fell in love with the sites all over the island.  We cannot wait to tour again in the future
Loved our visit.  Amazing views.  ,"Visited during covid.  Lines weren’t bad. Parking not an issue.  Hikes for all abilities.  Loved the beach, Gorman hike, sunset on Cadillac mountain, canoeing on long pond... so much more to do and definitely plan to go back!"
Great to add to your National Parks travel list,it’s was a great experiences.  very beautiful.  theb loop is good as it gets you around the island. .its pretty far to drive.  people have it in their national park bucket list.   i wish there were more of a museum experience to go with it.  i am glad we went but probably will not go back.  b
Let the winds carry you,"We started the day with a drive up through the Park Loop. We ended up spending the day in the park, you can very easily get carried away with a short wander into a beautiful area. Don't see a time limit on yourself for being in the park. We stopped at Jordan Pond and walked on the rocks and then found ourselves back in the car and on our way up Blue Hill and finally Cadillac Mountain summit. All have beautiful views and it's uplifting and inspirational just to be in that park.Be sure to have a cover for your ears or ear plugs and ladies should put their hair up. The wind as you get higher gets both cooler and more forceful. I do not recommend anyone wear a hat that could fly off during a big gust. Definitely wear your walking shoes, sun screen, and bug repellant."
Beautiful,The Schoodic Point section of Acadia National Park is one of the most beautiful parts of the park. Fewer people visit this part of the park so it is less crowded.
"Small for a park, rocks and sea and trees and stuff.","I am getting old and a bit jaded so keep that in mind. Easy roads to circle the park on.  Nice views everywhere too.  We traveled as the COVID-19 mess is happening so we were told the traffic was way down. Could have fooled me. Yes, stop and take your time in the wild plant garden, yes drive to the top of the mountain and spend time looking around. Optional is trying to get to sand beach."
One of our most adventurous vacations ever!,"My family and I visited Acadia national Park. We stayed on the quiet side of the island which was perfect for us. We able to watch the sunrise at several times from various locations as well as the sunsets.We did everything from biking the park Loop road, biking up and down a Cadillac Mountain, hiking the beehive as well as all other types of hikes both on the quiet side and other side of the park. The carriage roads were also perfect for a running and biking. We were able to swim in lakes here (although most were  cold) . We also visited the Schoodic peninsula which was amazing! In the park we also enjoyed a kayak tour with pinniped kayak and rock climbing instruction with Acadia mountain guides.  It was nice because they were not as many people in the area since the cruise ships were not running. Most of our trails that we hiked had little to no other people. Everyone here was very cautious and wore masks when encountering others. It is a beautiful area full of outdoor adventures!!"
Beautiful and lots to do ,"Take advantage of everything Acadia has to offer. You’ll need a National Park pass or buy a one day ticket. Rent bicycles and go around carriage road, canoe in the many lakes or bay, hike, go to sand beach, drive up Cadillac mountain, go to the lighthouse, go to the azalea gardens. Enjoy it here"
This should be on everyone's bucket list,"What an amazing place.  So many things to do. It was quieter due to Covid19 but still lots of people.  We were only there for 3 days but could have stayed longer.  Cadillac mountain, bass harbor, sunset cruise, carriage roads, bubble rock and thunder hole.  We kept moving so crammed a lot in but we will definitely be returning"
Family Vacation ,"Arcadia is a great national park, I’m not an outdoors person but this park will get you in the mood. Great views from Cadillac Mountain and just breathtaking. This is a must do if you’re visiting Bar Harbor."
So beautiful,"We biked to the bubbling brook. It is really such and amazing place to visit. The biking is a little challenging with some hills, but worth it once you get to the bubbling brook where you can rest on a rock in the sun or in the shade."
Stunning ,Acadia is stunning. The views of the cliffs and sea are just amazing. You must walk the Ocean Trail in the park. It was very busy so plan on getting there early. Many other attractions such as Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond fill up quickly as well.
Worth the price of entry,"First things first, single car entry is $30. We were only coming for one day and thought this was a little steep;however, this was good for 7 days. Parking at sandy beach is ridiculous. Just keep driving. Tons of parking on right side of road to enjoy thunder hole and otter point with less walking. Tons of pull offs all around the park for greats pictures. Drive to Cadillac mountain for the best views. In all, beautiful and worth the price even for one dY"
First time in Maine,"First time in Maine and the views were amazing. We live near the Smoky Mountains which has beautiful views as well, but Acadia and Cadillac Mtn were even more breathtaking!"
Heavenly!,"This is probably one of the most beautiful places, I have ever been to! It is my first time at Acadia National Park and I am in awe! Absolutely stunning!"
Awesome Sights,Great family experience. Great hiking.  Great views. Cadillac Mountian was the best. Will visit again.
Amazing,"Wow!! What an amazing park!!! You will need more than one day, and it’s very handicap/senior friendly with many flat trails and walking paths.We brought our dog, and it was great for her too!! We spent 3 full days in the park and I’m sure there are things we missed, but the views are stunning, the rangers are great, & I would highly HIGHLY recommend"
Best place to visit!,"Do not miss a visit to Acadia!  Travel the path by the Ocean, and buy the map and the guidebook to choose a hiking trail to your liking.  This is an amazing place to spend a day or a week in any kind of weather!"
Breathtaking beauty!,Absolutely loved Acadia National Park! Teenager approved. Beautiful hiking trails and the shuttle service to/from park was great. Love the use of the rocks as “arrows” on hikes. Thunder hole was amazing! Sand beach was beautiful!
Beautiful,There are so many wonderful spots to see in the park but our favorite was walking across the enormous rocks on the shoreline near Thunder Hole. The views from there and atop Cadillac Mountain were amazing.
Beautiful but how safe?,"I had not been to Acadia in over forty years, but still remembered the sounds at Thunderhole!  Knowing that there wouldn’t be as many visitors as last summer, we decided to go. We arrived before the store at the Hull entrance opened.  Therefore we could not get a map for the trails, and we were looking for how difficult they were, which was not available on the website as far as I could tell.  Cell service was not very good so the all trails app was unavailable, darn.  We drove along the Park Loop Road and stopped at the various outlooks.  It was beautiful and most of the park visitors we wearing masks and social distancing.  We parked at Sand Beach and after checking out the beach walked the ocean path trail.  There were lots of places to go out onto the rocks for fabulous ocean views.  As we got into the afternoon, more visitors arrived and now only about half were wearing masks.  We stopped at Thunderhole, which was not too crowded, but oh my gosh, most people walking down the steps for the view were touching and leaning on the railing.  We sat on the rocks for an hour or so and watched streams of visitors there.  I will not go again until the Covid scare is over."
Very nice scenery ,"We visited the park on a cloudy and sometimes foggy day but enjoyed our experience Would like to return on a more clear dayThe park has a 27 mile loop which we drove making frequent stops, the cliffs overlooking great water scenery There was a gardens area with various plants from the park Cadillac mountain was a great drive and overlook areas along the way. The Pond House was a nice lunch stop, mostly cafeteria food but popovers were very good along with the jam and butter that came with themIf you’re into biking or hiking there were many many trailsAs a senior I purchased a yearly pass that entitles me and my guests to enter any federal park for a year. Cost $20, a great deal!!I will definitely return"
"Beautiful coasts, ponds, and mountains ","We visit many national parks and while we wouldn’t consider Acadia to be one our favorite, it’s definitely not one of our least either. The scenery is beautiful and the park contains a lot of trails. With a 2 year old, we were limited somewhat with what we could do but there’s a few shorter/easier hikes still."
Jigsaw puzzle perfection,There were so many easy trails to follow landing you among the rocks and tide pools of the beautiful bay and ocean.  Thunder Hole no go boom!  However proud to say 90% of visitors wearing masks were as fascinated as I was to watch the tides.Reasonably priced lunch at Jordan pond and picnic lawn for social distancing.  Staff was sad that there was no recycling possible during Covid.  Every vista we saw reminded us of jigsaw puzzle subjects everyone has worked on!  Wish I were an artist!
Hike the Wonderland Trail for fewer people.,Disappointed with our lunch at Jordan Pond.  $22 for 8 ounces of lobster stew in a paper bowl seems a bit much.
Beautiful!!! ,Park is clean and the scenery is absolutely stunning! Kids had a wonderful time. Already planning a return trip.
A national treasure,"This place is stunningly gorgeous. The views are spectacular. If you are near Mount Desert Island, this is a must see."
Excellent Hiking & Biking,"If you like hiking, you'll LOVE Acadia!  Great biking, take the Carriage Roads.  The views are truly amazing."
Magical!,So much to see and do. Plan ahead and make itinerary to make the most of your time. I highly recommend staying as close to the park as possible to cut down of travel.
Amazing hikes,"We stayed for a week and did one or two hikes a day. It was a mixture of unbelievable views, fun challenging climbing sections on trails, interesting sights by the coast and the quaint Bar Harbor town is the cherry on top. Love love Maine and I travelled a lot all around the world."
Da Bomb Dot Com,Before visiting Maine we heard nothing but good things about Acadia National Park. I couldn’t anticipate how beautiful the park truly is. Probably the most gorgeous park I’ve ever been to. I recommend doing the Park Loop Drive and then stopping off in Bar Harbor for some local lobster.
You MUST Go To This Park!,"we had an absolutely wonderful day. There are incredible trails at every turn. Views of waves crashing against the rocks, natural beauty everywhere. Maine is notorious for foggy days and our visit to the park was no exception. Still that did not deter us. I'm so glad we went!"
Fantastic views,During the covid 19 pandemic needed a break since we are essential workers. Worth the $30 for the week entrance. Hiking swimming and gorgeous views. Cannot wait to come back
Best place to visit in Maine.,Great National Park!  Well marked trails and carriage roads.  Loved the Ocean Path going from Sands Beach to past Otter Point.  Easy walk with breath taking views.  The quieter time to visit is when school is in session.
Worth the drive - a great national park!,"A great national park with hiking, views you can drive to, sandy beaches and rocky beaches, lakes, forests, and lighthouses all can be explored and enjoyed in Acadia.  The neighborhoods in and around the National Park are quaint New England towns that are a pleasure to see and experience as well.  We visited just as Maine was opening from CV19 - limited still, but shops were opened, most restaurants were opened and while there were people in the park, it was pleasant.  We had no problems parking (although I suggest getting there early as Sandy Beach parking did fill up) and I could imagine it being crazy crowded in normal times.  We spent two days hiking and exploring while enjoying Bar Harbor at night and we can't wait to plan another trip to this great National Park."
A full day trip,"This park was absolutely amazing!  Recommended by my brother, we did the whole loop.  Multiple entrances at various places throughout the park.  Make sure to get a park pass online or at Sandy Beach entrance (pass is good for a week).  Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Cove (check online for when high tide is coming in - best effect is hour before and after).  Plenty of space to walk around on rocks and just sit and enjoy the view."
Sleepy late fall,"We visited Acadia mid November to find the island empty, silent and missed the foliage.I assume the leaves change early Oct. it was still a beautiful trip. I would argue this was the best time to visit- besides us driving around, maybe 4 cars passed the entire day?We could stop at each “parking lot” area with no issue. Oh and the entrance fee area was closed.If you want to avoid the packed crowds, late fall is for you."
Amazing views everywhere,"If you love and enjoy being out this is the place to go many trails, beaches and views. Ever where you go is a different view and there all beautiful. You can go to Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, or even climb Cadillac Mountain if you don’t like to climb you can always drive up to Cadillac Mountain. Can’t wait to go back. Great place for the whole family."
Gorgeous National Park,"Love riding bikes around this park on the miles and miles of carriage roads.  Be sure to stop at Jordan House for delicious, melt-in-your-mouth popovers.  Breathtaking views everywhere.  Beaches, Mountains, Ocean Views, Lakes, Ponds, Wildlife everywhere.  We even saw some young bobcats!  Can't wait to return."
A Few Tips About Acadia NP,"There is a definite beauty and ambiance about Acadia NP.  First found by the Indians 12,000 years ago, there is something to do for everyone. Acadia became a National Park in 1919.  It the oldest National Park east of the Mississippi. It is the number one attraction in Maine.  The village of Bar Harbor—pronounced as “Bah-Hah-Bah”—is a stone’s throw away from the entrance.  You can drive the Park Loop Road—27 miles.  First, though, you will need a National Park pass.Another way to see Acadia NP is to take the “FREE” Island Explorer bus from located at the Village Green park in Bar Harbor.  You will not need to have a park pass as the driver has one!  The drivers are friendly and informative.  Our first stop was at the interesting “Sand Beach.”  We walked along the “Ocean Path” for about two miles, viewing such famous places as “Thunder Hole.”  At high tide, the ocean water crashes into a crevice that causes a thundering clap.  A bus picked us up down the road. As a 12-year-old child in 1967, my dad took us trekking on “the Precipice Trail.”  My father got nervous when we had to climb up a ladder.  Falling meant certain death.  We made it and the views are spectacular. There are no dangerous snakes.  There are, though, Black Bears and Moose in the park. There are 125 miles of trails. My wife and I do enjoy the activity in Bar Harbor.  Crazy as it may, we enjoy the shops, restaurants and ice cream parlors. It is a good place to eat a “Lob-stuh.”  If you get up early enough, you can visit Cadillac Mountain—1530 feet high (466m)—at sunrise.  It would be higher, but ice ages smoothed the mountain over long ago.  Get there “REAL” early as parking is limited—very much like visiting Haleakala on Maui.  It is the first place to view a sunrise in the USA.  There is quite an interesting history of the area.  There is a museum in Bar Harbor which focuses on the ancient American Natives.  Eventually, artists found out about it and then the rich high rollers like Rockefeller, Fords and Vanderbilt’s built “cottages” in the 1880’s and Gay 90’s.  It was Rockefeller who donated much of his land, monies and time in preserving the area.  It almost came crashing down when an October fire of 1947 destroyed much of the area. August is the busiest time of the year with over 700,000 visitors.  December only had about 14,000 visitors, but many of the stores in Bar Harbor are closed.  Depending on your view point, Acadia NP is ranked in the middle of the 59 National Parks in the USA. The scenic beauty is ranked “8/10” and the facilities are “9/10.”  Nevertheless, Acadia NP has a quintessential charm that brings people back—like myself—time after time.

"Breathtaking, wonderful exploration",Stayed at the Bar Harbor Campground which is on the Acadia Nat'l Park bus route. Was able to take our bikes by bus and bike the trails in the park.  So many trails and areas to explore.  From the forest to the coast - a photographers dream.
Stunning views and wonderful trails.,We took the bike route through the Park. It is definitely a good work out. Wonderful family vacation .
Loved it here,Everything about this place is magical.  We loved the loop road and the hikes.  The key to getting parking and finding empty trails is to start your day early.  Such a beautiful place.
"Oceans and Mountains all in one place. Hiking galore, unimaginable views, Nature at it's best!","You need to come to see what you are missing!!!  Love it here. Been coming here for over 25 years and it never gets old. Still doing something new each time I come back. Love being outdoor in nature, hiking, biking, bird watching, gardening, and so much more. The views from each hike are stunning. Sunsets are gorgeous. Lots of places to go to get away from the summertime crowds if you want. Seawall and Bass Harbor Lighthouse are favorites as well as beaches off the beaten path. I look forward each year to my time in Acadia. It renews my spirit being here."
Lovely Views,We booked this as part of a tour from a cruise ship. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. We were taken to Cadillac mountain by coach. Here we were able to get out and wander around the area. The views were lovely and My husband was able to venture off far more than me. it is for the more able bodied due to the nature of the area.
Not easy to get to but well worth the trip,My wife and I visited Acadia National Park last Fall as part of a cruise of New England and the St. Lawrence Seaway.  The park was definitely my favorite stop as it was a beautiful combination of the Atlantic Sea coast highlighted by the scenic vistas from atop Cadillac Mountain.  We took a small tour trolly around the park and stopped at several beautiful spots.  The entire trip was about 7 hours.  Awesome.
"Pretty, nice hiking trails, not the most scenic place you could visit in the U.S.","Acadia national park was definitely top of our list of things to do when we were in Bar Harbor in December.  We appreciated the beauty of the park, but were a bit underwhelmed by it.  The reviews we read were really hyped up about how incredible it is, but compared to other U.S. sites like Hawaii, Yosemite, the North Shore of Lake Superior, the Florida Keys, Michigan, etc. it was pretty middle of the road.  To complicate things, the roads were almost all shut down for the winter.  We were able to get to Jordan Pond, but it took some trial and error.  The young man at the visitor center in Bar Harbor had clearly not driven the routes he was suggesting.  Worth doing since we were there, but not a destination park."
Stunning Coastline,Remarkable landscape. Drive the coastal road first to get the lay of the land. Hike a few trails to get a feel for the elevation and see some views that you can’t get from the car. Prepare to walk! Biking also recommended! Beautiful.
Wish I had Spent More Time Here,"From the smooth pebbled beaches to the hidden lakes and wildlife in the woods, Acadia provides stunning natural beauty. This trip was actually in 2013 not 2019"
New England family vacation 2019,"Trip included my wife and I, and 3 older teenagers.We did many things on this vacation from visiting Boston, catching a Red Sox game, touring Glouchester, touring Cape Cod, but the coolest spent time was at Acacadia National Park. What an incredible gem! Plenty of hiking, rock climbing, and touring. Such a beautiful place!"
Stay ouf of the fog! There are...things...in the deep fog. Otherwise beautiful,"Make sure to stock up on Rad-X, Radaway, clean water, Stimpacks and LOTS of ammo. Also look out for Trappers who have taken over most of the towns around the island, the fog has made them insane cannibals!!  Only Bar Harbor is safe. I met some cultists who worship something called Atom, they were not very nice. The hotel on the southern coast looks like it might be really nice, but when I got close it realized it was overrun with Super Mutants!  I found the Visitors Center, it was run some old crazy guy who refused to leave for the safely of the town. There is a nice drive-in movie theatre to watch great classics and a cool tannery you can visit, but look out for Ghouls!! I heard there are strange animals in the deep fog like Gulpers and Fog Crawlers. Might need heavy firepower to handle them.  Be sure to check out the old lumber mill too!  The observatory is really nice and full of refugees from Boston, they were pretty cool. You can find a day spa and a nice hotel up north of Bar Harbor, but I was told to stay away by this old fishing captain named Longfellow, he is always drunk so I cant tell if he is making it up.  Anyways! I really enjoyed my stat on Mt Desert Island!"
Stunning!,"Tour bus group of 54 en route to Nova Scotia made this gorgeous stop in Bar Harbor!Our tour guide met us downtown and narrated the trip and took us to the Blow Hole, beach, a walking garden path and hiking areas. A must see!"
AMAZING!!!,We drove to Acadia. I would recommend taking the bus inside the park because parking is really difficult to find. There is so many amazing things to see. I would highly recommend two or three days to see it all.
Enjoing acadia before the crowds! Day 1.,Stayed at Bar Harbor Motel outside of Bar Harbor early June. Wonderful staff beautiful grounds. Shuttle to town was not running yet but short drive to Bar Harbor or Acadia. Teens and my wife hiked the beehive i went up the backside and met them at the top. Views were amazing. Should have continued on to the Gordham trail but drove to the trailhead and hiked it. Wonderful weather and views. Also hiked the Great head trail earlier the same morning counter clockwise easy but cliffs are high. Here are some pics from day one.
A must see if you’re in the Bar Harbor are of Maine,Exciting visit to a majestic and scenic national park!  Got to see the sunrise and tour the areas of the park. Must see if you’re in the Bar Harbor area.
Acadia National Park/Bar Harbor,"Great hiking, most are easy to medium in difficulty. Beautiful views along the path ways and a swimming beach (sand beach). Bar harbor accommodations are a little pricey but there are plenty of reasonable hotels/motels along the highway as you approach Bar Harbor."
"Once you are here, easy to see it all","Incredible place! The beauty is obvious (and more readily absorbed via photos) so I'll spare you any flowery detail. The focus of this review is, in a word, convenience. TEN MINUTES from the main campground, and you are in the charming nearby town. Charming and beautiful in a classing New England sense. Dont feel like making coffee? Ten minute. Don't want to make breakfast? Ten minutes. Want a fresh pint? Ten Freaking Minutes. Incredible."
"Beautiful, Must See","Living on the east coast, we’ve got a ton of things to do, but what were lacking are national parks. Maine’s Acadia changes that in the best way. Located on Mount Dessert Island, Acadia National Park lives up to its reputation as the crown jewel of the North East. As of right now, the entrance pass (to be shown while driving on the Park Loop Road at various locations in the park) runs $30 and is good for 7 days time. While that is more than enough time to experience all the park has to offer, you'll always want to be back for more. My wife and I started thinking about our next trip there immediately after the 9 hour drive home. We only had 3 days in the park, but we made the most of it. A couple of recommendations, plan out what you want to do ahead of time and get up early each day, as the park can get crowded. We went over the Rosh Hashanah weekend and found it not terribly crowded any day except the Saturday (Public Lands Day, entrance fees waived). Begin your visit at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center to either pay your entrance fee, stamp your passport, or grab a map to explore the park. The rangers here are awesome and there are estimated wait times for each of the major attractions. Each also has its own separate restroom, but be advised, none will be as clean as the visitor centers. But it made a world of a difference driving in the park when the entrance fee was waived, and the crowds were everywhere. Acadia has activities for every age group and interest. We made our way to the Sand Beach, where we took a short but leisurely walk along the beach before heading to Jordan Pond. I recommend making reservations at the Pond House if you plan on eating there in advance because the wait time can be hectic with it being the only restaurant within the park. We spent a lot of time at Jordan Pond, its just really surreal to sit there and look at the bubbles beyond the pond. From there, we saved Bass Harbor Head Light for last. Guess what? Everybody does the same thing to if you want the iconic sunset, get there early. You'll hike down a rocky cliff to find tons of photographers set up and waiting and there is really limited parking at the site. The next day, we hiked up to the Bubble Rock, checked out the Thunder Hole, and drove up Cadillac Mountain. It gets almost 10 degrees colder as you're going up as its the highest elevation on the island so be prepared with extra layers. It is also a long, winding drive that a lot of people see the sunrise from but be prepared and obey the speed limits because driving in the park at night has been fatal if the speed signs are ignored. Our last day we spend hiking the Beehive, which was a fun, challenging hike. Next time we plan on doing Precipice. This is really a breathtaking site. Be patient, enjoy the many aspects the park has to offer, and don't wait to go here. Summers are the most crowded, while Fall is the most beautiful, and winter is also stunning but park amenities are limited."
Sand Beach and Thunder Hole visit,"Visited in November, avoided the crowd.  Very beautiful everyone in our group (age 11 to 71) enjoyed. Day trip from Bangor."
Amazing views!,"Amazing views throughout the park! You can hike many trails and/or bike on the bike only path throughout the park.  So many picture perfect stops by the water, foliage, trails or mountains.  It was sure a perfect way to enjoy the outdoors and connect with nature.  Information center was very helpful and provided trail maps and suggestions.  Restroom facilities are available."
So much to see,Huge park with so much to see and do. Trails for every level of hiker. We spent two days in the park and still did not see everything. Must get the popovers from the cafe int he park also. Yummy.
Has been and still is beautiful.,"We stayed at a vacation rental in Pittsfield, Maine by the lake, watched nesting Bald Eagles being fed by their parents. Then we took a day trip to Bar Harbor and up to Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park. It is all so beautiful. Don't forget to have lobster on the way there."
Hidden gems galore!,What i loved about Acadia in comparison to other parks is that there is no comparison! It is very unique and has beauty that can be populated and shared or found in quiet solitude. You just have to see for yourself!Small elevations with spectacular views!The hikes are harder than you think so wear good gear😉
Wonderful adventure in Maine as the season is nearing a close.,"Acadia National Park and the Bar Harbor area are glorious. Prosecco and Popovers on the expansive lawn at the Park is not to be missed. Dinner at the Asticou Inn was amazing. A day trip to Campobello on the Bay of Fundy was a highlight of our time in the Acadia area. FDR’s family history explored in a park shared by U.S. / Canada was fascinating. A light lunch overlooking the Bay of Fundy and learning about this not so well known piece of Americana was lovely. Take the bridge in Lubec, Maine and bring your passport so that you can enter and return from Canada seamlessly.  And while you’re in Maine, find Blue Hill where there is a rare gem of a book store - the Blue Hill Book Store  -  where I found the perfect gifts for an Anglophile friend and another for my youngest grandchild. Across the street you’ll find the wonderful watercolors of Randy Eckard. As to non-literary gems, check out the Tourmaline shop on the Main Street in Bar Harbor. Gorgeous. I’m looking forward to my next trip."
Another worthy national park,"This may not be one of the top national parks I have been to, but it still enjoyable and offers a few great views. Cadillac Mountain and Sand Beach were the two areas I consider to be the biggest ""must"" sees. Well worth the visit and plenty of entertainment in the area to keep you busy with the night life."
Best island tour,We trulyruly loved this tour and the scenic drive that included the changing fall colors.  Stops were frequent with phot ops offered.
Wow!,"What a beautiful place, it was cloudy and misting but still wonderful. We took a bus ride through the park and what a nice ride."
Wonderful park compares with great parks in the west.,"We have done a couple dozen national parks and this may be our favorite. Has it all, rugged ocean scenery, great hiking with views, beautiful lakes plus history. The bike/carriage trails were fabulous and we went during fall color season and it was beautiful."
A Must Visit!,This is a beautiful National Park you don't want to miss and it is lovely in the fall as the leaves are turning. It can get quite crowded with cars and people and there a lot of places you can't stop to take pictures but it is one of the great parks to visit.  We took a hike all the way around Jordan Pond. It was easy and close to the shore except for one section that was rerouted a bit as they were building walkways. We went in Mid-October and the weather was lovely. This is a good hike for families as the ground is flat but you'll have to carry small children as there are a lot of rocks and boulders you'll need to climb over.
Fall visit! ,"My husband and I took a day trip to Acadia Park which has a lot of breathtaking scenery and numerous one of a kind photo opportunities in Nature. Whether at the Summit or downtown. People were friendly, lots of quaint shops, limited parking though in town. Only a slight inconvenience but the rest will fade it out immediately."
WOW,I visited Acadia national park during the color change season and it did not disappointThe sights are amazing between the color and the waves hitting the rocks in the harborI could have spent an entire week in the park and cannot wait to go back again and do whale watching in the area
"Beautiful views, awesome bike ride","We traveled the Loop Road on bikes (rented in town - pedal assist for the hills) and were just amazed at the beauty of the area and scenic views.  Tons of picture opportunities.  There is a fee to enter the central part of the park - so be warned.  However, we ended up buying a senior year pass to all National Parks - so that worked.  Otherwise the price is a little steep.  There are a few stops, one restaurant and a gift shop or two after the toll booth.  But do it - it's beautiful.  It is a one way loop, and you have room for a bike.  Just don't miss any exit to go back to town, or you are looping it again, as it is one way."
Hike up Sargent Mountain,"Since we were there on a holiday weekend and Cadallac Mountain would be so busy, we decided to climb Sargent Mountain instead. It was a gorgeous hike and the stop at Cedar Swamp Mtn on the way up was an extra bonus."
It's not that spectacular compared to...,"..Yosemite and/or Yellowstone national park, or the Central Coast of California. So if you've seen any of those, then Acadia National Park is not something to make a special trip out for, which is what we had done. It was beautiful, but not worth the extra trip. If you happen to be passing by, then stop for an hour or two."
Autumns Best Show of Foliage Colors,"Most of the islands traffic flows nicely on off hours, be prepared for tour buses through out Mt Desert and the NP. Wherever your day trip takes you and if you don't take advantage of NPs shuttle bus system. ""Go Early"" to avoid waiting for parking spots, they're limited.This park has a one-way loop road with several places to stop, park and explore along coast, multiple hiking, biking trails, some that loop around mountains and lakes and a panoramic drive up to Cadillac Mt. Acadia is known for Historic carriage trails throughout the lower park. If you want off the one way park road, there is Rt3 that's a normal two way traffic road around the island.There is another section of Acadia NP to the north called Schoodic Point. You will have to drive back inland and head North to get to Schoodic Point. One-way loop to incredible spots of a pink granite boulder-strewn beaches with massive angry waves crashing into the shores. We chose not to camp in the NParks campgrounds for the lack of facilities and utilities.The small tourist/port town of Bar Harbor is full of what tourist want plus ice cream. Parking is tight and limited. NP shuttle system stops in town as a part of the loop. There are several charter tour companies to hire and for the cruise ships, etc...Lobster pounds everywhere ready to give you a show. Gas prices where same as mainland. Plenty of hidden coves and few lighthouses in the area. Keep track of time and the high tides. Warning beware of fast driving tourist rushing irresponsibly in and out of everywhere, We had several calls while on our motorcycle."
a really nice park if you a keen hiker,We are not keen hikers and we didnt had the time anyway - just to go around with the car is allready great - very scenic specially when you go in the Indian summer time. Not one my favorites NP in the US but a relly nice one
One of our favorite national parks ,"We have been coming to Acadia for years and will continue.  The park has features and views you won’t find anywhere else.  One of our favorite parts of the park is the Seawall area.  A little quieter and great trails, picnic area, and campground. Don’t miss the Schoodic part of Acadia- beautiful views, great campground and hiking, and BEST OF ALL- less crowds!  We loved being able to park and find a campsite.  If you really want some Bar Harbor time or to visit the main section of the park, there is a wonderful ferry from Schoodic to downtown Bar Harbor.  From there you can walk to all the shops and restaurants in Bar Harbor or get on a small bus that takes you throughout the park.  You get to do the park or town and do t have to worry about the difficulty of finding parking!"
Amazing views,"Autumn is the perfect time of year to visit Acadia; with the trees changing if offers wonderful opportunities for viewing and photos. It was rainy when we drove through, but it was still beautiful. I'm sorry we couldn't have had more time in the park and really experience it, but I'm glad for the time we had."
A Must See if Visiting Bar Harbor,Scenery in Acadia National Park is breath-taking and not to be seen elsewhere. A 150 minute tour is sufficient to get a taste of this magnificent place. This place is a must see and one of the best parks I have visited.
Stunning views!,"There is a choice of Bus shuttles or Park Entry passes which is what we chose and purchased at the  Hulls Cove Visitor Centre. Our ticket was $30 valid for 7 days. The roads are well maintained with plenty of viewing stops and parking lanes. The map provided show the recommended stops such as Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and Otter Point.  You can swim at Echo Lake Beach and Sand Beach but most other lakes and ponds are closed to swimming. There are campsites ( must book during summer season)  and toilet facilities marked out although be careful at this time of year as not all facilities are open and you may find portaloos in car parks! Would be great to make use of the 7 day pass and spend time walking on trails as well as driving."
Breathtaking Ocean Trail,"I have never seen more natural beauty than Acadia and this part of Maine. The weather was partly sunny and the air was cool and brisk but perfect for an easy walk on Ocean Trail. The leaves were slightly past peak but they were still stunning. Just when you think you’ve seen the most beautiful point, you see another. Lots of friendly people on the trails as well, I cannot wait to return."
Unique Beauty,"We traveled here all the way from Florida as a college graduation present for our daughter, who wants to eventually visit all the national parks. This is the first national park we visited where the earthy colors of the rocks, the dark green pines, and the sea all came together for a one-of-a-kind panoramic view.  We wish we could have stayed longer.  It was so worth the trip."
Beautiful coastal views.,"Lots of things to do. I would highly recommend biking the carriage trails. Parking is challenging for the more popular tourist attractions, especially if you go during common hours. Try to do the loop early in the morning."
Nature at her best!,"Late October bus/walking tour of Acadia National Park in conjunction with Silversea cruise.  Leaves still had lots of color; great views of the sea and forest.  Only downside was folks doing selfies, endangering themselves and ruining photo ops for everyone else."
Absolutely Breathtaking!,"Wonderful and knowledgeable tour guide through RCCL. Only 1 restroom open for men and women , by time you get to use the restroom you have to be back on bus, leaves no extra time to enjoy the stops.But absolutely beautiful sites."
A beautiful maritime national park!,Well worth the drive to see Acadia National Park. South Bay was not worth the trip and the limited parking at the lighthouse was very poor. Be advised some water tours close down after Oct. 1
Lovely,Some of the views are excellent. Even in the off-season there is plenty to see and do with less crowding. Just driving the Loop road is great thing to do.
Beautiful National treasure,"Benefiting from few visitors at the end of the season, we pretty much had our run of the place without the traffic and crowds.  The scenery is stunning, lots of hiking and biking opportunities.  We did a self guided, narrated park loop tour, stopping and doing some short hikes along the way.  I t was a perfect time to visit with the park almost to ourselves and about a week past peak leaf viewing...but still some fall color to enjoy."
A must visit,This park is a must for the “peepers” in the fall. The colors were outstanding! The view of the cost line was spectacular.
Different and Wonderful,"First, get it out of your mind (speaking for myself) that a national park will put you in the middle of an evergreen forest.Then you will marvel at the wonderful and different sights available here.  Rounded granite outcroppings with varied vegetation, deciduous forest. Be sure to go to the top of Cadillac Mountain for views of surrounding bays and islands.Really a gem!"
Beautiful park!,"Beautiful scenery! We were there in late October and had NO crowds at all.  The leaves were still in full color and it was beautiful! Loved the Jordon Pond Loop trail but beware--even tho it is listed as an easy family hike, the last mile if you do the full loop is a narrow elevated boardwalk.  The park has good roads, you can drive to most trailheads but the signage within the park is tricky...  Get a good map!"
Must Do Trip!,This is a must do if you are in Bar Harbor.  Take your time doing the loop road. Visit Sand Beach.  Cadillac Mtn with views for miles. Jordan Pond Restaurant for lobster stew and popovers a MUST! Take the carriage ride tour.
Acadia NP tour,"Taking the Acadia NP tour the first day was a GREAT way to orient ourselves to the Park. Friendly, knowledgeable driver with interesting facts."
Limit Coaches,"We took a coach trip to Arcadia National Park which took us up to the top to view Cadillac Mountain. Sadly there is only a single road to the top. We stopped at several look-out points on the way up to look at the view, but these were choked with visitors like ourselves. The view at the top was beautiful and there is ample opportunity for spectacular photos if that's your only goal. Beautiful park, hence the traffic."
Beautiful and captivating scenery,We took a van with a total of 5 couples to tour the park.  The history of the park and the surrounding area is fascinating and it is well worth the price for a guided tour.
Quite possibly our favorite National Park!,"We have traveled to many National Parks but Acadia stoke our hearts! With a great town just outside the entrance this park allows you to enjoy the spectacular hospitality of Maine surrounded by stunning beauty, great hikes & great lodging options despite not have a National Park Lodge. Tip: Summer is peak season but it’s amazing in fall, I’m not sure we’d ever consider coming in a different season because we loved a little less chaos & stunning foliage."
Off Peak Season is the time to go!,"We heard about the craziness during peak season from the locals. It was hard to believe because when I say we had the entire park to ourselves, we had the WHOLE park to ourselves. Drove up to Cadillac Mountain a hand full of times, visited every marked destination, walked in complete silence. Do yourself a favor and experience nature without all the tourists coming off the boats."
Amazing!,One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been! The sunrise at Cadillac mountain was breathtaking and Thunder Hole was awesome!
Go!,This is a beautiful place with so much to see and do.  Spend 3 or 4 days or more.  Stop at the Information place just before you go on the island.  They can tell you everything and you will be ready to tour the island.
Beautiful but very close to civilization,"Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island in Maine and experiences the first sunrise in the US at Cadillac mountains between October and March. The park is a mix of different experiences - you could hike the mountains and trails, kayak in the lakes and ponds, bike/walk/run on the carriage road or just relax by the sand beach.We had 2 complete days on Mount Desert island. On day one we biked a 22 miles loop to and fro Jordan Pond on the carriage road. The road is undulating but the uphills work you out and the downhills are super fun. Trees almost peaking with fall colors added to the beauty. You could choose to do the Eagle lake loop alone which is about 5.6 miles and as beautiful as anywhere else. On day 2 we climbed the beehive trail and the bubble rock to get a bird's eye view of the park.Along with the hikes, we drove along the park loop road to stop at Sand Beach, Thunderhole and Otter point. Sand beach was a little smelly but there is a 3-mile scenic trail starting there (which we didn't have time to do), and it's recommended to go to Thunderhole during high tide.For sunrise, I would absolutely recommend the Cadillac mountains. Keep ample time in hand because you're driving up a mountain, the parking space is limited and the crowds are crazy. Everyone generally heads to the lighthouse on the southwest harbor for sunset - it's pretty but again, really crowded.The protected park area is interspersed with civilization, and there is decent phone coverage on the island. Bar Harbor has a wonderful small-town feel with awesome restaurants. But do note, most of the shops and restaurants close for the season by October 3rd week, and so does the park shuttles. I would love to visit the park again with some more time in hand to explore the island."
Great hiking adventure,Make sure you get your National Park entrance before u go. Saves time and can be used for a whole year! If you and your family love to hike this is the place to go!Lots of places to hike and enjoy the out doors! In fall the colors are beautiful!
Acadia National park ,Lovely park with trails if interested in hikingSuggest early to mid October to see the fall foliage. Our visit in late October was almost too late.
Natural beauty,"The park offers a scenic drive that encompasses scenic overlooks, Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond and Sand Beach.  There are gift shops at Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond. There is also a restaurant at Jordan Pond.  Hiking trails are available with differing ranges of difficulty.  We chose the 3 or so mile hike around Jordan Pond.  The trail around one side of the pond is leisurely and not at all strenuous. The trail on the opposite of the pond is not difficult but is extremely rocky.  Wooden pathways have been constructed in some areas to prevent damage to the surrounding ecosystem.  Along the trail is a loon nesting area.  The park i serene and filled with beauty."
Stunning!,"Do the Jordan pond walk, get up before the sunrise to go to the Peak and watch the sunrise or the fog; whichever it's so pretty, walk the ocean walk. The diversity, the fall leaves are stunning. The pond is so clean you will be amazed. The Jordan Pond house was the only disappointment in that they were literally closing for the season the next day so not only were the staff's attitudes ""checked out"" but they would not sell us a pop over to go! ridiculous. But again - go to the park, experience it. Walk alot and enjoy!"
One of our favorite spots in Maine,"The pink granite and stunning views make this a must see national park.  Smaller than most, it has so much to offer with hikes and scenic vistas."
"One day is good, a couple days would be perfect","We were here with a cruise so our time was limited to one day.  After looking at all the tours for sale and the limited amount of time you get to stop at a few places in the park, we knew we needed to do it on our own.  We rented a car from a local place and did Acadia at our own pace, stopping whenever we wanted for as long as we wanted.  There are trails for people of all abilities and some of the views are amazing.  We came at a perfect time, but I can see how parking at some stops would be impossible during a busy day or peak time.  There are parking lots available, but some places are only big enough for a couple cars at a time with no road side parking.  Pick something up for a picnic and enjoy the views, they don't disappoint! You could spend as little as one hour if you just ride through the park to many days on the trails."
Amazing National Park,Worth every penny.  The trails and trail markings are very well maintained.  There are roads and park facilities are excellent.  Definitely do the Ocean Path and Beehive.
Beautiful Fall Foliage,"Just beautiful. We enjoyed the ocean views, carriage trails, and day hikes. The fall foliage was wonderful and easily experienced from the loop drive or short hikes."
Fall Getaway,Great visit to Acadia National Park.  We obtained our National Park Pass at the Visitors' Center and proceeded to plan our hikes.  Great service by the rangers and info staff.
Stunning views and worth the drive,"We came to Bar Harbor the last week of October.  Leaves were beautiful. The sun didn’t cooperate but the views were still gorgeous!  Since it was the end of the season the park was quiet and we had many overlooks to ourselves. Took lots of mini hikes, took lots of pictures even saw one deer along the roadside.  Fun to get the Acadia stamp in our national park passport. Absolutely worth the drive!"
Beautiful scenery with a whole bunch of people,"It seemed like there is just one road through the whole park so even though we were there at low season, the road got backed up and you would sit and wait.  We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend going, but I can't even imagine how crowded this place is in high season."
Beautiful way to spend a Fall day,"It costs $30 to take your car in for the day but the pass lasts for a month so if you have time to return, it becomes very cheap. There are lots of walks or you can just drive the 27 mile loop and stop wherever you wish.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful so do go if you are in the Bar Harbor area. We walked to the top of Bubble Rock and took some great pictures at Bear brook.  Some of the walks are a bit tricky so make wise choices before you set off."
Beautiful,"We drove all through the park on the loop road. Because of a nor'easter storm the night before, we had to detour a bit because of a closed road.  The views of the ponds and forests of fall color were stunning. Thunder hole is a great stop, as well as Cadillac Mountain. So glad we visited this National Park in the Fall."
Unbelievable Scenery! ,"What an amazing National Park Acadia is! We had some issues with which entrance to use but seemed so do the entire loop so it  worked out well. We got to see all the highlights, Cadillac Mtn, Thunder Hole, Otter Cliffs and enjoyed every second of it. The weather was fantastic and everyone had a super time. My FIL law has the senior park pass so we were able to enter free too, bonus! You could spend a long while in the park but we were there about half a day."
Love it!,We have visited many NP units. Acadia is one of the only ones we have returned to. It is so beautiful where the mountains meet the water! We just love the fun short easy hike around Jordan Pond and the popovers are amazing. The area in  between Jordan Pond and the restaurant is one of my favorite places on earth.
A magnificent display of fall colors,"We spent almost a full day there. Arrived at the information center around 10am. Ticketing and information staff were very friendly and helpful. They suggested the routes and the spots that we shouldn’t skip. We didn’t take the strenuous trails but chose mostly the flat trails. Drove around and stopped at multiple points. Parked at Sand Beach and walked until the Thunder Hole (wasn’t very thundering that day). Colors were everywhere - perfect timing and nice weather. The view from Cadillac Mountain were spectacular but we didn’t get to see it for a long time because it was already dusk. We saw people staying for the night, to star-gaze there."
Amazing,Awesome park for both families and couples. I would recommend getting there early to avoid crowds on popular hikes. Bubble hikes had amazing views and less people.
Excellent National Park!!,"Although this is a fairly remote national park it is well worth the effort to travel to. The diverse scenes of forest, rocky ocean coastline, wetlands, and harbor towns make for a wonderful vacation. Plan on getting out of the car often to get a closer inspection of what Acadia NP has to offer. You will not be disappointed! We will return!"
An Interesting Excursion ,"The trolley took us through the park, with our tour guide explaining the history of the area. He stopped at points of interest for us to get out and take photos. The scenery is fabulous!  This was a great way to see the park without driving and dealing with traffic."
Great place to hike and see the leaves!,"Many different hiking and driving routes to see the colorful leaves of Fall.  Make sure to take the Sand road and head down to the beach area, drive up to Cadillac Mountain to see the views from the peak, and take an adventurous hike around Jordan's Pond."
Quintessential undisturbed Maine coastline,"Textbook example of a glacially sculpted landscape.  It was fun to take a trolley ride (about 1.5 hours) through the park and listen to the history as we drove.  It was low-tide when we stopped at Thunder Hole, but it was magnificent nonetheless.  We drove up Cadillac Mountain, but it was foggy that day so we couldn't see the view.  Interesting that there are private citizens, including Martha Stewart, who live on Mount Desert Island.  We were told that is because the land for the park was donated by private citizens.  We are on a quest to see all of the National Parks so we enjoyed going to Acadia."
Such a neat place to hike with young children ,As a family with a 1.5 year old and an almost 4 year old we always wanted to go hiking but want the 4 year old to do some of it on her own. And this park provides this for young children. There is something for everyone here. Even the adventurous forever childless millennials there is a pretty steep climb not recommended for dogs or kids. But there are others great for young kids as well.  And the views are just amazing here. I highly recommend this place for families and for young people and old everyone really. Well worth the fee for sure. You pay 1 time and good for 7 days I think $30 but not sure my wife paid while kids napped. Drive around and check it out. I recommend the beach part and the smaller hikes where you still get a view.
Awesome!,"A magnificent park - beauty everywhere you look! If you are lucky enough to be there in the fall, you are lucky enough!"
Cadillac Mountain,"Went with friends and hiked to the summit of Cadillac Mountain on a not too busy weekday. This is a interesting hike across granite structures that are marked by rock cairns to guide you along the way. Great vistas and wonderful scenery along the way. This National Park is off the beaten track, but worth the effort to visit."
So beautiful!!,"It was busier than I thought it would be for a Friday but we day tripped from Vassalboro. We hit Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond House for lunch, and Cadillac Mountain. Such a beautiful day, the leaves were amazing. NP staff were lovely. Next time we're going earlier so we can hike and spend more time but I highly recommend making Acadia part of any trip to Maine!"
All the Fall Colors,This park is absolutely beautiful! You can hike along side the ocean or hike a mountain and if you are unable to do that there is a lot places you can drive and get a good look. The views from the mountains are just stunning. I will definitely be back to hike some more trails. This is the perfect place to see some awesome fall colors! 🍁
Spectacular Views!,"We enjoyed the stop at the visitor center; received good advice from the people there.The drive was scenic and pleasant. Various restroom stops are available. The trail is well marked so you know what you are looking at. Was it worth the time and drive? Yes, it was and we had already taken a 3-4 hour scenic drive along the Coastal highway, the day before, from New Brunswick to Bar Harbor.You will not be disappointed."
A gem that lives up to its reputation,"Considered to be one of the most beautiful National Parks and we felt it deivered. There are several entrances to the park, but, as usual we were glad we had not gone in the summer. As expected parking is iffy and with crowded conditions would not have been as much fun or as easy to explore. Much of the roadway is one way, which helps.  The scenery is gorgeous, there are several places to stop and walk down to the shore and trails are common to explore other areas. Word of warning -- the visitor center is at the top of a series of steps. If you have mobility issues someone will have to drop you off at a separate parking area only for vehicles with handicap stickers. None of this is well marked. It is possible to take a shuttle they the park but the ones we saw did not stop for folk to get off and explore, just a pause for a quick photo."
take a day and hike,"not the easiest hike, but half is flat and paved.  The views are spectacular, wildlife all around.  Jordan pond is crystal clear.  There are some rugged hill climbs if you are adventurous"
A National Treasure To See,Although smaller than your typical Nation Park - it is worth the visit/tour while you are there.  The history of how it became a National Park was very interesting and the views/scenery was the best in Mid-Fall.
Most beautiful National Park!,"We had a wonderful visit to the park, we received good information from the park information booth.  We loved Cadillac Summit, hiking to the Bubble Rock and Thunder Hole!  It’s very windy and cool at Cadillac Summit,  bring warm clothing/layers, hats and gloves!  the Bubble Rock hike takes some endurance, it takes awhile to get there through rocks, some mud, leaves, etc.  It was quite a sight to see and well worth the hike.  It could be better marked...Thunder Hole needs warm clothing, too. We asked at the Information Desk as to what would be an opportune time to visit it.  We did hear some thunder!  Amazing!!!Well worth spending the day there.  I wouldn’t want to rush through the park.  There aren’t a lot of restrooms~plan accordingly."
Most Beautiful Place I've Ever Been,"Hubby & I love hiking & exploring with our golden retriever so naturally Acadia has been at the very top of my bucket list for years so finally getting to visit this past week was a dream come true.  First off I'd like to say that I think it's awesome that there are portions of Acadia that you can visit free of charge, we did just that, in addition to paying the $30 for the day, more than worth it and when we visit again next year I'll be sure to buy the multi day pass. We stopped at multiple points throughout the drive through the park but my favorites were Thunder Hole & Cadillac Mountain.  As much as I love hiking I gravitate to areas that are in close proximity to water, perhaps its because I'm an Aquarius but I find a sense of calm near any body of water and Acadia provided that tenfold. Thunder Hole was very cool to see but I'll be sure to plan my next visit around high tide to see it in full effect and feel its power. Cadillac Mountain was breathtaking, I got goosebumps seeing the sun set from its peak and will plan for the sunrise next time. You could easily spend weeks in this park and still have hundreds of things left to see, truly the 8th wonder of the world and the most beautiful place I've ever experienced."
Fall colors,"The colors were spectacular in October when we went. We had a great time on Ollie's trolley.  The clouds blocked our view from Cadillac Mountain, but the variety of colors made up for it."
Beautiful and workable even though it was crowded,"The scenic loop is one way for half of it, so plan ahead if you want to time seeing the Thunder Bowl at the right time. We had to drive around the loop to try again. That wasn't too long. It was beautiful. There was enough parking to get out and see the scenic views and there are many trails to take. We loved the rocks and flowers and views of the ocean. The Thunder Bowl was not impressive because the ocean was too calm. It booms as air gets trapped as waves go in and out. It was enough to get the idea. Cadillac Mountain was very cold and windy, so bring a hat and coat! It is only 1500 feet high, so the views are low enough to see what you are looking at."
Stunning,"Stunning scenery in Acadia National Park.  Some commercialism around Bar Harbor because of the cruise ships that come in regularly. We stayed in Southwest Harbor, which was lovely and quiet, at the The Inn at Southwest371 Main St, Southwest Harbor.  The place is nicely positioned and hosts are very welcoming and accommodating.  Went on a cruise out of Northeast Harbor and saw seals and porpoises as we were kept well informed of the local flora & fauna and history."
Fall Colors are fantastic,We visited here the middle of October and the fall colors were amazing.  Taking the loop kroad allows you to stop and see a variety of sights from rugged ocen front cliffs to miles of hiking trails.
This place has everything!,"Beautiful!  We walked the Ocean Trail as a family and it was a pretty easy walk, but very pretty.  You can see the ocean, rocks, forest, mountains.  We loved it.  It was our favorite place on Mt. Desert Island."
Trip to Maine,"My visit to Acadia National Park was amazing and surreal. Visiting the park during fall was the best decision I made. Beauty of this park was beyond my expectations. The ocean, mountains and little towns were all beautiful. I highly recommend this park to all who can visit."
One of the nation's best parks.,Beautiful park!  Huge mountains meeting the crashing waves of the ocean.  Hiking trails all over the place and miles of carriage trails for biking.  Excellent restaurants in Bar Harbor.  Only drawback is how crowded the park is in the summer.
Acadia National Park,This park is a must see in the fall. It’s a great way to spend the day or two.  We really enjoyed the ocean views from the mountains. It’s pretty crowded and specific spots are not clearly marked... or if it is there are so many people you miss the signs. The bus loads being brought in from cruise ships really cause a lot of congestion and take a bit away from the experience. We were so amazed by the way people rush to it all in such a frenzy.  But it is beautiful.
Simply Stunning!,We didn't plan the trip around the Fall colors but what a treat to drive and hike in the park and see the stunning change of colors.  There is much to do here so plan a full day at least or several days to do some great hiking.
"Beautiful landscapes, must explore by foot","Only had a day to explore, drove up to Cadillac Mountain and enjoyed the breathtaking views of Porcupine islands, drove to Sands Beach, spent most of our time here and walking the Ocean path trail. There are lots of offshoot trails to take and explore the rocks and different landscapes or just chill and take in the sun, waves, fresh breeze, blue sky. Wish we had planned for more days here, since we only got a chance to explore a few spots. Will definitely come back to explore the rest of this wonderful park."
Beautiful Park - Must Visit,"Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island in Bar Harbor, ME.  This would be the first national park east of the Mississippi and is also the first place that will see the sunrise each morning in the United States as well from October to early March.  There are many places to explore here, but I only had a few hours as I was here visiting with a cruise ship on October 2, 2019.Before coming here, I had prearranged a tour of Acadia National Park with a private tour company.  Due to tendering issues, we had to start at a later time than originally planned.  We would explore parts of the Park Loop Road, Cadillac Mountain, Wild Gardens of Acadia, and Thunder Hole.  Weather was cool for the day, with overcast skies and temperatures in the low 50s.  This review will be more of an overview of each of the locations visited.  I posted a more detailed review of each of the locations on their own page.After about 15 minutes or so, we were inside Acadia National Park.  We would do most of our travels in the park along the Park Loop Road.  Our first stop along this trip was Cadillac Mountain.  It was cool and very windy.  However, that didn't stop me from taking in the views.  There were great views of Frenchman Bay, including a view of the Disney Magic, which was the cruise ship I was on.  The panoramic views were stunning, even with the overcast conditions.  There was also some information on the history of the park and other general information here as well.Our next stop would be the Wild Gardens of Acadia.  Travel time was about 25 minutes to get here after leaving Cadillac Mountain.  We would have about 20 minutes to explore the gardens.  There is a nature center where you can get info on the past of this area, as well as what the future may hold.  You can easily get lost in time visiting the gardens.  It is a beautiful location to visit within the park and should not be missed.Our last stop in the park was definitely the highlight of the tour.  This stop would be Thunder Hole.  We would have about 20 minutes to visit this location as well.  The timing was pretty good, as we were there about an hour or so before high tide.  I spent most of that time taking photos and video of Thunder Hole.  I was even able to score video of one of the thunders there.  This was a breathtaking experience.  If I had more time here, I would have stayed much longer, as there were some nice views to take in there.Overall, the park visit was excellent.  It was more than I expected.  The views were stunning at each of the locations visited, as well as some of the spots passed on the way to each of the stops.  If I come back up this way outside of a cruise, I plan to spend much more time in the park and explore other areas there too.  Acadia National Park is a must do attraction when visiting Bar Harbor.  You will not be disappointed."
Beautiful!!,Amazing national Park - one of the best.  Be sure to take the 27 mile drive.  Go to top of mountain.  Dine at Kordan house.
Stunning Fall Colors,"We were here for the Autumn foliage and were rewarded with a myriad of Fall colors.  This in combination with the beautiful coastal waves and clear blue skies, you have many, many photo opportunities.  We joined a shore excursion from our cruise ship doing the Acadia loop drive and a lobster talk by Captain John at an Inn and wish we had devoted more time to Acadia instead.  This park must be enjoyed at a leisurely pace so you can take in sights at all points and angles.  A must do if you're in Bar Harbor..."
Beautiful Park,The scenery in the park was amazing. We only had a few hours but drove up to Cadillac Mountain (with our tour guide) and then around to some special spots in the park. Definitely worth the view on top of the mountain.
Beauty and History!,Took a tour arranged through our ship which was excellent. Talented young guide with intimate knowledge of the island and local history. Sufficient stops to get a feel for the park. I wish there was more time to explore. Great photo opportunities here.
Another must see national park.,"A small, but interesting national park.  As with any national park you can spend as much time there as you would like.  There is always something else to do, some place else to hike.  Make sure you go to the top of Cadillac mountain.  The whole park can be viewed from there, 360 degrees.  There is a great bit of coast line complete with rocks to climb on.  This  park is made up of donated land and is not contiguous. This makes traveling through the park an interesting mix of going though small towns and the park.  Another interesting fact about this park: There is a picture of a moose on every piece of park memorabilia that they are selling. However, there are no moose in the park.  When we asked about that, the park staff compared the moose to Sasquatch.  Hilarious."
Must see,"Beautiful at top of mountain. If you want to stay more than 15 mins. do not take a tour, drive yourself."
Absolutely gorgeous ,"My husband and I visited Acadia National Park today and it was breathtaking.  The fall colors were beautiful,  accented by the blue water.  We drove the Park Loop Road which is 26 miles long and goes around the entire park.  There are several pull overs where you can stop and get pictures.  Every stop was worth stopping for.  The drive itself is so pretty with the winding roads lined with trees.  It wasn't extremely busy but a couple places we did have a hard time finding parking.....being persistent we eventually found a spot.  This is definitely worth visiting.  Think it's the prettiest national park I've seen."
Like Lake Tahoe on the ocean - great hiking and views,This is a nice national park - the only one in Maine.  There are nice hiking trails and a lot of bikers on the roads (so be careful).  Make sure to drive to see great views from up high.
Great visit for fall colors,"We hit Acadia National Park on 10/14 and 10/15 of 2019. The colors were at their peak and hills and mountains were spectacular.  Cadillac Mountain produced gorgeous views, but all of the overlooks did the same. A wise word to the driver: go early in the morning. By late morning the parking lots fill up and the traffic is horrendous.  This is, of course, true for all Parks with color in the fall. Go early and you will enjoy everything. Go late and you will only get views out of your car window!"
Natural Beauty,"Take your time in the area and allow at least 2 or 3 days to explore the various parts of the park, more if you are into hiking the numerous trails within the park.  There are too many highlights to mention.  Pick up a map at the entrance and try to do a loop around the park, but be sure to check times for best viewing at Thunder Hole.  Definitely going back."
“Beautiful” doesn’t do it justice,"Acadia National Park is a true gem. Here you can experience the power of the ocean (Sand Beach, Thunder Hole), the majesty of mountains (Cadillac Mountain), and the serenity of the Jordan Pond. There is also the stillness of the forests, set ablaze on our October trip by the color change of the leaves in autumn revealing many more shades of yellow, orange, red and even brown than I previously knew. You can go by bike, go by hike, go by car or go by bus, but the key is GO! Go experience this breathtaking display of beautiful nature. You will be so glad you did."
Brilliant!,We spent  day here and would have liked longer.  It is well worth the $30 entrance fee.  We drove up Mount Cadillac where the views were breathtaking.  The Fall colours in the park were wonderful and there are plenty of parking/pull in areas so one can stop to admire the scenery and take photos. We were especially thrilled to see a family of white tailed deer.
Beautiful park,We took an excursion that went through the park.  We were able to get out a few times to see the vistas and enjoy the beautiful fall foliage.   I would recommend a tour through the pro as we learned so much about the history of the park and facts about the great fire and the bridges.  Really a nice day.  I would love to go back and enjoy the trails.
Stunning ,"We visited the Bar Harbor area and Acadia National Park recently. I have never been to New England and did not know what to expect. We truly enjoyed the beauty of Acadia National Park. We only spent two days in the park but enjoyed gorgeous hikes with stunning views of the Atlantic and the amazing display of colorful leaves in the Autums. Sand Beach was beautiful with its blue water. It’s an inlet and we hiked along the cliff trails surrounding the beach to outstanding views below of Sand Beach and the ocean. We drove to Cadillac Mountain where the wind was super gusty that day. There is a short hiking path there with panoramic views of the Atlantic. Also there is a small gift shop and bathrooms at the top if Cadillac Mountain. We visited Thunder Hole, but the waves coming in 2 hours before high tide did not make the loud clap of thunder sound that day. However, we were not disappointed because the waves splashing over rocks and just walking around the area made for a nice time. There’s a gift shop there, as well. While near Thunder Hole, we hiked to Cadillac Cliffs. This is a beautiful hike over rocks, under rock overhangs, and through the woods. We also hiked to one of the Bubble Rocks which was uphill and the forest was vivid with color. We drove to Jordan Pond, did a two hour, relatively flat hike around the pond. The hike had breathtaking views of the pond, more like a small lake, colorful leaves and a forested area. At Jordan pond, there’s a very nice gift shop and a restaurant. Acadia was beyond beautiful in October. In Bar Harbor, the town was a beautiful sea coast older town with great Inns, shops and restaurants. There was so much to do in Bar Harbor. You can take a few hours sea excursion, as well. My only regret is that the time we spent driving up highway1 and in Bar Harbor and Acadia was way too short. The National Parks our west are massive and jaw dropping, but Acadia certainly held its own with its own kind of beauty. I highly recommend a fall trip around the first or second week of October to this gorgeous area."
Amazing,This is such an amazing park to see! So many beautiful pull offs to enjoy the scenery and soak in the views. We had a rental car so we were able to take our time and enjoy it at our own leisure. It does cost $30 to get in for the day but it was well worth it!
Beautiful Park!,"We took a small group tour through the park mid week in October.  The crowds were great as everyone was there to see the fall colors.  The colors in the park were stunning and it was nice to hear the history of the park from a guide.  It was our first visit, so the tour was a great way to get acquainted with the park and its history."
Beautiful and Accessible,"We stayed at the Atlantic Eyrie which is about a mile outside of Bar Harbor which I was glad of when I saw how busy Bar Harbor and the park were.  The visitor center has a huge parking lot and it was almost full - despite the availability of shuttles.  Given this the park staff have done an excellent job in making sure everyone has a quality experience.  They have parking areas at strategic spots and allow parking on the side of the road near the interest areas - brilliant planning I say.  What you do is drive down a mostly one way road and pull over and park at places that seem interesting or beautiful.  The highlight is the top of Mount Cadillac which affords an incredible view of the the hillside and the bay.  Winding up to the top there are also great views and at the top there is a large parking lot that circulates cars as people come and go and it seemed to accommodate all the visitors.  There is a short circular walk you can take to see the view from all the sides.  We also stopped at Sand Beach - very popular - and later  drove to Eagle lake and hiked around it.  You walk on a wide old carriage road until you get to the far end where you have a choice to walk on a trail instead, there is a stretch where you have to rock hop. Leaving the Island we stopped off at Ship Harbor enjoyed the nice walk with views of the estuary and the wild ocean.  So.  Its incredible and don't stress out because of the crowd because it will all work out."
Acadia National Park,This was our 2nd visit here and it certainly doesn’t disappoint!! Both times have been in the fall and the colors are beautiful!! Lobster is pretty good too!!
Great Park,This is a great park. Lots if activities and vibrant colors. Well worth a visit in more 5han 9ne season.
Don't miss Acadia!!,The park is absolutely amazing.  The views were great.  It was extremely crowded when we went in early October due to all the people gathering to see the leaves change colors.  Still worth the crowds to see it all!
Best time for leaves,I researched the best time for fall foliage the last 5 years and I will say it gave us the best time we hit peak! It made the scenery that much more beautiful such a beautiful fun place
Nice Drive,We took a tour bus to take a glimpse of the Park. It was picturesque and the water areas nice.It was nice to hear about the area with a tour guide and we would've enjoyed the tranquil surroundings if we'd stayed longer. When your on a tight schedule its hard to just be and soak it up.
Stunning!,"The views were absolutely stunning! All the fall colors were the reason I planned my trip here, and I was not disappointed."
Beautiful,"We have thoroughly enjoyed hiking and seeing this beautiful National Park.....there are many, many trails to hike that it is difficult to choose which ones to hike.  The park does get very crowded especially in some of the more popular locations...so get up early!  We went in the fall so the colors were in abundance.  We enjoyed the view from Cadillac Mountain and did many stops along the Park Loop Road that is 27 miles.  It has taken us several days and there is more to see and do..."
A MUST DO!!,"We only had one day to visit Acadia this trip...but we’ll spend more time next visit. However, if you only have one day...get up early (5:00am) and drive to Cadillac Mountain for the sunrise.  We arrived there at 5:30, and had a great parking space.  You can see it from your car if you get a good space, but if you can, walk right out to the rocks to get a spectacular view.  It’s a close walk...not hard or far.  Even though it was a little cloudy, it was gorgeous!!  Then, take a drive around Park Loop Road.  Make sure you stop at Schooner Point and MAKE SURE to walk down the path there to the water.  It’s absolutely amazing down there.  Worth the walk and not too far down there.  Also see Thunder Hole...it’s worth the stop. Both are right on the side of Park Loop Road.  We made it around the Park Loop Road and saw these amazing sites and magnificent views in about 3 hours. But you can spend a few days there taking in the trails and Mt. Desert Island nearby.  We were perfectly happy with our 3 hours though.  Worth the stop even if you only have 3 hours."
Fall color abounds! ,Weekend crowd was maddening but after the  long weekend it was entirely manageable.  Had a blast walking along the coast on the massive rock formations along the shore. Cadillac Mountain is a come early as there fog/clouds roll Lin b and sock it in. Very windy. Great trails.  Roads in good condition. Best to park at mid point lots and stay away from those next to the big attractions.
Acadia is a beautiful National Park,"I would recommend you take some kind of informative tour first to learn more about the park and how it was formed.  Then, revisit the places you liked best on the tour.  There are opportunities to rock climb, bike ride, picnic on the beautiful rocks along the ocean, etc."
Beautiful Park,This park was so beautiful!  We hiked along the Ocean path and was amazed by the views.  Most of the trail is flat but there are places for you to climb off the path and get a better view of the ocean and the rocky shore line.
A fantastic early October trip to see the fall color.,"This was our second trip to Acadia and it didn't disappoint.  We hiked for two days - the Great Head Loop Trail - Otter Cliffs, Thunder Hole, hike/walk around Jordan Pond, tea and popovers at Jordan Pond Restaurant, sunrise at Cadillac Mountain, the Beech Mountain trail and the Ship Harbor Nature Trail."
A hike to remember,"What a beautiful national park. You might as well but an annual pass because you will be there every day. The leaves were changing color, the temperatures were a great relief from the Florida heat, and the sights were spectacular. Bring your hiking shoes and poles, you will need them. The Bernice trail, the Gorham trail and the top of Cadillac mountain are all must do's. Put this o your list"
It just trees,"Our tour of New England took us here last week. It was brilliant to be on top of “mountain” , feel the wind and cold and see the amazing views. ( but be aware, only two toilets here which can be a problem for a 20 minute coach stop for 47 people!). The area by the sea was very spectacular with crushing waves. Just a lovely park."
"Excellent Views, both Driving and Hiking","We spent three days exploring the park during the peak of fall colors, it was beautiful and spectacular.  Even with three days we still couldn’t see everything.  We are in our 50s and hiked both the Bubble Rock and Beehive, both of which take skill and strength.  If you want something less risky, the Ocean Path along the coast, and Thunder Hole are both excellent, easy walks.  Parking is really a problem throughout the park during peak season, but you can find a spot with patience and good parallel parking skills.  It is a trip of a lifetime, and we highly recommend it during the first or second week of October."
We a-DORR-ed the Mountain,"Although a windy day we still spent an hour CHILLING at the summit, BLOWN AWAY by the views! The terrain was a STEP UP from what we are used to but we ROSE to the occasion and had a TOP day out! On the way back down we got a bit lost as the signs aren't that clear. But the area is VIEW-tiful so we didn't really mind!"
Beautiful Fall Colors,"Visiting from Arkansas, but grew up with Minnesota Falls. The views were beautiful and there are hiking trails and carriage roads so everyone can experience this great Park. We are seniors and are making our way through the National Park system.  You will not be disappointed. Plus you can get lobster rolls at the Traveling Lobster!!Another must stop."
Mind boggling mountain.,Words would be insufficient to explain the beauty of fall colors all around.A well maintained forest with lots of points to see including small beach.A must visit place.
Great scenery and drives,We enjoyed driving the loop road around Acadia. The scenery of the coast was very pretty. We also saw Bass Harbor Head Light which perhaps is not in the park itself but nearby. We wanted to eat at Jordan Pond Restaurant but it was packed and there was an hour wait so if you want to eat there and it looked great call ahead. We enjoyed the view from Cadillac Mountain but did not catch sunrise which is suppose to be gorgeous.For most visitors 2 days should be ample but allow more time if you like to hike.
Beautiful but...,"I am from Maine and have been to Acadia a number of times; I love it. That it is gorgeous and a stunning national treasure has been said before, but the park service has to get a handle on the number of people in the park. I can't remember a time I've been there before that I saw as many people there as I did this time. Popular spots, like Sand Beach or Jordan Pond, are starting to resemble an LA theme park for the sheer number of tourists walking around with expensive cameras. Something has to be done. It was overwhelming and it will probably be a while before I go back."
BEAUTIFUL!,"Gorgeous fall colors, interesting history. Took the carriage ride through the park, saw the sunrise from Cadillac Mountain (tip-take a very warm winter coat to this!!)"
Immaculately gorgeous ,"Not much can be said that hasn’t already been mentioned. The park is gorgeous and incredibly well-maintained. The views from Cadillac Mountain were beautiful as long as you can handle the temperature. Early October and we had chilly rain and wind, but it was still very pretty and well-worth the effort."
A natural treasure !!!,"This park is a natural treasure and provides something for everybody! You need a park pass for every car, which also can be used to the Island Buss system."
Spectacular Place to Visit,"We visited the second week of October.  The leaves were almost perfect and the park was not too crowded.  The scenery is absolutely spectacular.  This is a must visit place, especially at this time of year,"
Beautiful,I can't say enough about the beauty of the park in fall. There are so many options for hiking and walking here. The carriage roads are magnificent. There are amazing bridges to see on these roads. I also liked that I felt safe hiking in the woods because there was no danger of bears.
beautiful,I can see why millions visit every year. Absolutely beautiful and the views are amazing. There is such a variety of  plant life. From the ocean to Cadillac Mountain. The colors were awesome.
Did the 2 1/2 hour bus tour from the town to Cadillac Mountain and back,"We bought a cruise ship excursion to see sights in the park like Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, and Cadillac Mountain to ensure we would get a tour of this park. The tour has a couple of short stops for Thunder Hole and Jordan Park and a longer stop at the top of Cadillac Mountain. Thunder Hole is only impressive when the tide is coming in; otherwise there is no spray coming up out of the blow hole. Jordan Pond has a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Its popovers (2 for $8), a take on Yorkshire pudding, were popular and were served with jam. Its gift shop was stacked with jars of jams and bags of popover mix. Outside there was a path around the pond which gave us an opportunity to see what one of the carriage roads looked like. These gravel roads are mainly used by the horse and carriage ride businesses. As the bus climbs up Cadillac Mountain, there are many opportunities to see vistas of the Bay, small lakes, and forest trees - without human development or industry. In mid-September, the deciduous trees had just a hint of Fall coloring. The peak of Cadillac Mountain offers some rocky trails to walk along besides just standing at a rail to take pictures. We enjoyed our 27 mile tour of the island. On our way back to town, the bus driver drove past some of the summer homes built by wealthy families that weren't burned in the island fire a while back and through the town."
Beautiful Park. Worth a longer visit!,"I was here on a cruise tour, as such I only spent a day here.  But it was just a very beautiful park.  One of the smallest of the national parks, it is also one of the most beautiful.The view from the top of Cadillac Mountain is spectacular!  Try not to miss this. My final verdict is that, as a nature lover,  Acadia National Park deserves more than just a day trip!Try not to miss Thunderhole!"
Gorgeous park!  ,Beautiful foliage and views on the clear day we went.  Would love to go back again and spend more time and explore on our own.  We went on guided tour.
Amazing foliage,"We just finished a three day stay at Acadia NP, at the height of the fall colors. It was spectacular!  Acadia offers diverse terrain for hiking and biking, impressive coastal vistas, and quaint villages to stroll around. The only negative was the cruise ship crowd jamming Bar Harbor and the hiking trails on the east side of the island. Over 200 cruise ships a year!! At least they don’t typically get to the central and western island trails."
So beautiful! ,Outstanding and worth every second of travel! Acadia exceeded our expectations and we can’t wait to return!
Incredible National Park,"Acadia National Park is a national treasure!  Between crashing waves on the rocky coast to Sand Beach to untold number of hiking trails to beautifully groomed carriage trails to unbelievable views, Acadia has something for every member of the family!  Any number of places to stay from fancy hotels to camping and lots of fabulous restaurants, you will love Acadia and Mt. Desert!"
Hike the Jordan Pond and The Ocean Path trails,"Our kids are 5 and 7 and they made it through both these hikes and the Gorham Mountain trail in two days and had a blast. The mountain trail is quite taxing, but the view at the top is worth it. It is short and coming down is really fast so you can keep walking along the coast after that. Also, there are no restrooms at the Gorham Mtn trailhead, so plan accordingly. Stop by Thunder Hole and hear the awesome sound. This is a tourist bus stop so it is very busy. If you want to park there get there at 8am.  There is a gift shop and restroom. Get your parking pass the day before you go if you can—it will be good for 7 days and is required for parking anywhere in the Park. The entire park has paved roads to each lot and the drive is nice too!"
Loved this national park,We bought the CD audio tour and used it to tour the park. We spent the first day doing all the sites and went back the second day to hike around Jordan Pond. We went back to Mt. Cadillac a second time because the view was so amazing. There was a lot more hiking we could have done if we stayed longer.
Fabulous!,"We probably spent 1.5 days in the park (in the course of 3 days), hitting the highlights such as Thunder Hole and Schoodic Point.  Our best experience by far was sunrise on Cadillac Mountain.  As there are only 145 parking spaces, we were warned to arrive no later than 5:30 for a 6:30 event.  As we were extra paranoid, we arrived at 4:40 and we weren't the first.  Although it had rained the night before, the sky was absolutely clear and the magnificent Milky Way blazed overhead.  I've never seen anything like it.  The sunrise over the Atlantic was equally stunning.  BE WARNED:  the mountain is cold.  When we left the house, it was 60 degrees.  The mountain (at a bit over 1500 feet) had temperatures in the mid 30s and it was windy.  We wrapped up in emergency car blankets.  Arrive prepared."
"Definitely worth a visit, especially in the fall","What a fabulous place to visit, probably any time of year. However we visited in the fall. Trees & views amazing, organisation of the area was very good. The free bus service was much appreciated and certainly well used. A must for anyone to visit."
Very busy on holiday weekends,"We visited Acadia National Park over Labor Day weekend. We chose to drive ourselves rather than take the shuttle bus service. It was easier for our family of 5. We started each day bright and early. We found parking spots easily until about 10-11 am. The crowds really built up then. Get up to Cadillac Mountain early or late. By 11 am the line of cars to get a parking spot was very long. They even had to close the road up the mountain. Other popular spots like Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and Jordan Pond were similar. Even on the other side of the island, the popular trails had full parking lots. We packed a lunch and took our chances. We got to see and do everything we wanted to. I recommend taking the shuttle bus if you don't have a large family or kids."
Marvellous ,This is a fabulous area which is well worth a visit. There are many tours which can be taken from Bar Harbour depending upon what you want to see. The higher that you go the better the views are.
A wonderful National park to visit,"We took a bus tour of Acadia National Park.  Our guide was extremely informative and told us the history of Bar Harbour as we went up to the park.  She knew all the kinds of trees, plants and animals in and around the park and told us fascinating stories.  We took the loop route and ended up at the highest point of the park.  It was a clear day and you could literally see forever!!! For those who come by car, there are many excellent walking and cycling routes to take to get to see the park at a closer range.  Since we didn't have that much time, a 2 1/2 hour bus tour was an excellent way to get a taste of the park.  I would love to go back for a longer period and actually walk some of the trails.  This is a place where people of all ages can come and see.  It's a true national treasure."
Easy to drive the loop and breathtaking views.,"My mom just had knee surgery so we couldn't go on any hikes or where there were long walks. The visitor center with souvenir shop had 52 steps to get up to it so she couldn't do it. It was easy to drive to Cadillac Mountain, though busy waiting for parking when you get closer to the top, we were able to find parking. Dog friendly in this area, spectacular views and she was able to walk around.  You pay $30 per car for a 7-day pass which is good because there is so much to see. I was there for work so we couldn't visit everyday and due to Mom's knee surgery and my dog we couldn't visit all the hot spots such as Sand Beach which looked beautiful from above. There are many pull off spots to take panoramic views. The other spot we were able to see was Thunder Hole which was also busy but enough parking. There is a small souvenir shop at Thunder Hole which is open until 4:30. Did not get to go to Jordon Pond House due t location and dogs not permitted in that area. Probably best to split up the visits to the park between the 7-days because of all the spectacular spots and lots of stopping to take photos. We were there the 1st week in October so the leaves were just starting to change color."
7 days of walking heaven,"The National Park is a mecca for walking, hikes and scrambling, I had very enjoyable 7 days there walking. You have to be careful about the hikes in the preceding days to any rain storm, the granite is very slippy. That said there are miles of well drained and maintained carriage roads which you can enjoy. The paths are well signed - with cairns and paint. There are some more adventurous routes for those comfortable with height. My single advice is always go up - east to west and down - north to south."
Beauty all around,"This park is stunningly beautiful.  Acadia has the ocean, scenic cliffs, forests and lakes.  Carriage roads were built many years ago (by John D Rockefeller) so bikers and hikers can enjoy the great outdoors without automobiles getting in the way.  The park stores sell hiking maps for about $5....money well spent.  This was our 2nd time here and we will be back.Our trip was in September.  Park was busy but not super crowded like it is in the summer."
"Great trip, lots so see and do!","Maine up close, leaves were gorgeous, busy trail heads at times. If you go early, it's much less busy. But you can find more secluded spots,  It was fun and the hike around Jordan Pond (a walk really) was very nice, great pics."
Autumn Splendor,"We should all be grateful that those that came before us had the good sense to preserve some of these beautiful places in the USA and that the National Park Service continues to protect them.  Acadia is beautiful, particularly as the leaves are changing. Get over to the Western side of you want to get away from the crowds a little bit."
Beautiful Natural Setting,We did the ride around trip because there was a light rain all day.  We enjoyed the view at every stop.
Great park,Park is awesome!   Can either drive or stop and hike.  Views off outer loop are outstanding.  Hike vary by difficulty and are breathtaking.  Loved it!
Had a great visit at the park,We traveled from Dallas to Maine for the weekend (Friday night to Monday night).  Had a great visit at the park although my husband is into bird photography and we didn't really see many birds he didn't already have.  Scenery is gorgeous.  Trees were turning colors.  Even though we had purchased the lifetime senior pass we were never asked for it.  Saturday was fee free day.  Not sure why we weren't asked for it on Sunday.
Beautiful September Day,We were recently in Bar Harbor Maine and spent two days in Arcadia National Park. The weather was warm and sunny and because of the time of year it was not very busy. The views were amazing and the park has plenty of places to stop and take pictures.
"Excellent time, beautiful views, easy to drive the loop!","The loop around park makes it so easy to access all the different stops, about 27 miles around one time. Take the time to also go up to top of Cadillac mountain, so pretty and awesome views. The coast line of Maine is so rocky and majestic looking. Highly recommend this park to anyone. Take the hike from Sand beach to Otter's point (or atleast to Thunder Hole...again, some great views you won't get by driving)."
Beautiful views all around,"This place was amazing! Luckily we were gifted an annual pass that allows entrance and private vehicles into the park, if not we would have paid. We stopped at Thunder Hole, but the tide was too low. We stopped at Otter Cliff and drove around to different scenic stops. It is a half a days trip to drive through the park. We didn’t see everything either."
Be careful when following the maps along the trails,"We stopped at the Souer des Mont location and decided to go on a short hike.  The mistake made was not obtaining a trail map at the visitor center and relying on the free map available.  While the maps along the trail purport to indicate the degree of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate  and Difficult) they are not well delineated.  We thought we were on an Intermdiate trail but would up climbing Mt Cadillac along the Canon Brooke trail-the trail is rigorous and not for those not in some modicum of shape-literally climbing steep rock inclines with disaster at hand should one stumble. The trail itself was elusive at times with occasional blue stripes in the rock showing you that you were on the right path-which we were not.  We would up on the opposite side of the mountain from where our car was parked after a 4 hour ""adventure"" only to find we were along the Bubble Pond trail.  Thank god that they have free shuttles in the part (I suspect our experience was not out of the norm).  I can tell you the vista from the top of the trail was spectacular and there was a bit of pride in knowing 2 people in their mid 60's did this successfully-but the beer and wine that night flowed freely in celebration-though the next 2 days we could hardly walk.There is a lesser known part of Acadia NP to the north of Ellsworth off of Hwy 1 which I would recommend for watching the waves crashing against the shoreline with far fewer people. Amazing place but THANK GOD for the shuttle or we would still be there."
Lovely park,We really enjoyed the park loop which allowed us to tour the entire park and make frequent stops for photo opportunities. Be forewarned...it is very windy on top of Cadillac mountain but the view is spectacular.
Beautiful area,"We had 2 days in the park. The first day we went on the Island explorer bus (see review) but the second we took the car to Bass Harbour on the quieter side as the bus were not so frequent.  Despite a detour for road works we found the wonderful lobster shack, Thurstons (see review)"
Natural wonder,"Breathtaking drive and views of one of  nature's wonders! Great planning went into making this park easy to enjoy and maneuver throughout the park. If in the area, don’t miss the park loop drive."
Breathtaking ,We were lucky enough to visit Acadia National Park on a beautiful sunny October day. The scenery is amazing. Although we sadly only had one day here there is so much to do I can imagine you could spend several days and still not see or experience everything. Absolutely breathtaking.
An amazing and a must visit place in the US,"Absolutely gorgeous place - you get ocean, mountains, and forest. What more do you need? Just one word of caution - if you visit during high foliage time as we did, be prepared to share with folks off  cruise ships  and tour buses..."
Beuatiful,My wife and I traveled to Maine and New Hampshire for 8 days. Acadia was one of the highlights of the trip. The view from Cadilac Mountian is beautiful. Look forward to going back someday.
Probably my 40th visit ,"Acadia offers so much— sightseeing, surf, ocean, rocks, fishing, kayaking, hiking— perfect National Park. We keep coming later in season to avoid the crowds and yet it was quite busy even this late in season. We drive around parking lot for 15 minutes trying to park at Jordan Pond House and finally gave up. The park has changed in many ways since my first trip 68 years ago— and so have I. Mountain hiking just not on my agenda anymore.  I feel in love with Beautiful Acadia in 1951 and still in love."
Beautiful and Breathtaking,"Can't say enough about Acadia.  Great hiking trails, beautiful scenery, helpful folks at the visitor center.   The sunrises and sunsets are great there pretty much anywhere you go."
"Scenery was great, weather perfect","Had a driver Woody ,he took us all over the park and stopped at beautiful sites. Thinking of going back next year"
Don't Miss this National Park,By taking Oli's Trollies we experienced more than we ever would on our own.  The vista's in and around this park are wonderful and gave us a real view of what this Sea Side community is really like.  In and out of season.  The Ocean side drive and Cadillac Mountain were fantastic!
Don’t Miss,"The shoreline of the primary portion of Acadian National Park is varied, awesome, soothing, roaring, full of sights that both startle and soothe.  If you like water, rugged coastlines, the sound of waves, and enjoy being mesmerized by moving water, you will find a feast for your eyes, your ears, and your soul, at Acadian."
"Beautiful park, lots of things to do!","We stayed in Bar Harbor and spent two full days in the park. Half a day was spent cycling around Eagle Pond and Jordan Pond, we hiked the beehive and the ocean path. Beautiful views, great trails and not too hard to get away from the masses of tourists if you just hike up a bit."
Pristine park,"The mountaintop views are breathtaking and the rocky shoreline is spectacular! Gorham mountain trail and then to sand beach are worth the effort, but fairly steep and extremely rocky path. Just take your time. We are in our late 50’s and did just fine taking it slowly."
So thankful we stayed the extra day!,"We had planned on spending all day in the park on the day that Hurricane Dorian hit.  Essentially the park was closed that day.  After the rain ended late in the afternoon, we ventured over to see if the Visitor Center was open.  I think we were the last to come in before closing.  They told us that Thunder Hole was open, but to stay behind any barricades.  The timing was perfect!  The sea was still churning from Dorian and the tide was coming in.  It was beautiful and very loud.  They told us that Cadillac Mountain would probably be open in the morning, but no guarantees on whether there would be fog.  The next morning we hopefully drove up Cadillac Mountain, and we were treated to an absolutely stunning view!  So thankful we stayed an extra day..."
Maine in September - breathless,"The Acadia National Park offers Cadillac Mountain with views of Bar Harbor and surrounding islands, Thunder Hole where you hear a roar as the surf hits a cave in the rocks and beautiful scenery as you drive around. Stop at Jordan Pond and have lunch. It has great food , flower gardens and Jordan Pond ( actually I would call it a lake)."
A lovely place to visit,"Altho' we were too early for the Fall foliage, we thoroughly enjoyed our 2.5 hour Oli's Trolley tour of the park. There is so much to see."
Fall foliage,Beautiful!! Breathtaking!! We drove around. We visited sand beach at high tide and Thunder Hole where the water hit the rocks and made a thunder sound. Worth the visit!
Beautiful ,Such a gorgeous national park with so much to see! Drive the Park Loop Road - it’s mainly one way and gives you a chance to see the beautiful spots to park up and explore.
God’s Country,"Whether you explore Acadia by sea kayak, on foot or motorcycle, in a car or bus, or wheelchair there are parts of this park accessible to all. We chose hiking and stopped along the way to take in the gorgeous scenery and enjoy the beautiful vegetation. There is parking throughout the park and bathrooms. Check your park brochure for those details. Take water and snacks. At Jordan Pond there is a restaurant but it is a zoo."
One of my favorite parks,"There are so many incredible hikes, I wish we had more time.  We coupled up some hikes together to get the distance we wanted.  There were many incredible views (highly recommend Gorham and Beech mountains) with a lot of rock scrambling throughout the park.  Make sure your shoes have good support and traction."
So beautiful has it all Ocean and moutains!!,So beautiful! Has it all water (Ocean) Mountains trees and wild life too!  Spend 5 days here and could have spent a lift time! Met people from all over the world!!Enjoyed walking on the trails and swimming in the Ocean!  Yes in the Ocean in Sept.
Fantastic scenery and great food at Jordan House,Loved this park!  Beautiful views and scenery. Loved the Jordan House for lunch too.  Fun souvenirs in gift shop.
"How can a National Park be less than ""Very Good""","Not the park's or anyone's fault but the traffic gets incredibly slow behind bicyclists on the road.  Hikers have other paths but sometimes the bikers need to use the roads and when it's down to two lanes and cars are parked in one, it's tough.  We prefer a more isolated experience.  This was a busy park, almost too touristed."
Beautiful park,"We just spent a few hours in the park, mostly driving the loop road. We stopped at Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and Otter Point. Then we drove up Cadillac Mountain. It was a beautiful clear day with beautiful views of the ocean."
BEAUTIFUL PARK,"To my knowledge and experience, this Park really ROCKS!!! Literally! :)  Vacation here and enjoy!! Everywhere I went, to many harbors, art galleries, other shops was excellent. You won't be disappointed especially in the summer and fall."
Beautiful!,We just had two days. We loved the Park Loop Road. It was an easy drive and allowed us to stop at main highlights such as Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond.
Best National Park East of the Mississippi,"Acadia's shoreline vistas are breath-taking.  To avoid back-tracking, drive the Park Loop road CLOCKWISE, as it is one-way in sections.  Pop-overs at the Jordan Pond House ($4 each!) are the best I've ever eaten.  The walking trails  around Jordan Pond and the Gardens are easy and relaxing.  September was a great time to visit --- no crowds and plenty of parking available."
Worth the drive!!!,"I was hesitant to drive here and camp because of the time of year, but wow it was great camping.  Pick a site that suits your needs.  Take a towel because the place offers no way to dry your hands or face.  We were in B section of Blackwoods campsite and used a National Park’s Senior pass to enter the park.  Camp site was $15 per night. Take the park drive but allow 3 hours or more to stop and look.  Cadillac Mountain parking is small so go early.  Spaces free up, but you might have to circle around 3-4 times."
Sightseeing,"September was a great time to visit.  It was still busy but no traffic jams like in summer.  We drove all over two days in a row.  We walked to see some of the vistas, beach and thunder hole.  We did not take any of the longer hikes.  They looked great but we have back issues. We then drove down the coast which was beautiful too."
A pretty maritime national park,"There are many ways to seethe park.  Most people like us drive the hour and a half loop.  There are many overlooks of the bay and opportunities to walk out on the rocks overlooking it and to hike.  The visitor center doesn't have much besides a gift shop, some rangers to ask questions of, and a place to pay the entry fee that you display on the rearview mirror of your car.  We chose to do the Precipice hike, a very streuous andsoemwhat dangerous hike to the top of Champlain Mountain.  It took us four hours to do the loop.  There is a lot of scrambling over boulders and pulling yourself up ladders - basically iron hand and foot holds in the granite rock.  There are some fairly hairy places where you hold on while placing your feet on other footholds with a sheer cliff below it.  It's not for the faint of heart."
This is a must see!,"Thunder Hole was amazing, as was the sandy beach.  We ate at Jordan's Pond on the lawn and loved it.  We drove ourselves, but there are tours available."
What is there not to like???,"Acadia National Park is a true gem.  The scenery is breathtaking; the hiking trails too numerous to count and if you prefer biking, the carriage trails are lovely and plentiful.  Don't leave Bar Harbor without visiting Acadia!"
Awesome 4 days in September ,"Flew into Bangor Wednesday. Found great coffee place near airport Wicked coffee with awesome pastries & vegan offerings. Got early checkin at Edgewater Motel. We bought our park annual pass at visitor center senior was only $20!Tired, we enjoyed a good meal at Thirsty Whale & walked around Bar Harbor where we found yummy dairy- free ice cream choices. We made it to Cadillac Mountain sunset- best view from Blue Hill though- get there 1hour early for parking. Dress warmly!Thursday- Breakfast at Great Maine for oatmeal walnut pancakes & blueberry preserves, tofu scramble- highly recommend. We hiked BeeHive- our favorite trail. It’s a little scary if you have fear of heights but doable with views worth it. jordan Pond for popovers - 20 minute wait for inside(35 outside). We saw the Bubbles, but fog overtook them by the time we finished eating. They had vegan options- panini & quinoa salad. We were there for Star week so went into town to hear talk at library which was enlightening & free.Friday- went biking in Carriage Roads. My husband, though very healthy, had quadruple heart bypass 3 months ago so we weren’t sure about this. It’s a great time. We rode most of the day, saw bridges & beautiful ponds auto free. Get helmets! We came upon a bad head injury bike accident! We used Acadia bike rental. Explorer for park has a bike van to take bikes to park from town. We rode back to town via Duck Brook rd.  Went to Reel cinema for movie & dinner- fun & good pizza BUT you must get in line before doors open to get tickets!Saturday- sunrise Cadillac Mountain was fun- get there an hour early for a spot at Cadillac Mountain, dress warmly. We had breakfast again at Great Maine. Next we rode down to see the Bass Lighthouse- opens at 9:00, trails to left are fun & offer another view. We checked out Wonderland on our way back which was another great trail. We then saw Thunder Bolt, otter cliffs. We stumbled upon Gorman Mountain that was another great trail! We hadn’t planned for so many rocks- super fun just wish we’d dressed differently- shorts instead of jeans.Then we went to the Criterion theater to see IT.  Couple things- really enjoyed Coffee Matters personable with good drinks! Thrive next door has awesome healthy Smoothies, salads, Açaí bowls.Really enjoyed our perfect weather, great outdoors, food! We’ll return!"
Beautiful park on the east cost,"Acadia National Park is a beautiful place to visit on the east coast - with rugged shoreline, forest, and interesting rock formation. There are also nice places to visit such as Bar Harbor, Northeast Harbor, and Southeast Harbor to grab lunch and shop for local craft stuff. Head up to Cadillac Mountain, the highest point on the east coast, is also a must."
Fantastic scenery at every turn,"There is something for everyone at Acadia.  You can enjoy kayaking, hiking from mild to strenuous, horseback riding as well as the shop til you drop atmosphere of Bar Harbor.  We came for photography and Acadia does not disappoint."
Wonderful!!!,I love National Parks and this one did not disappoint.   We took about 1 1/2 days in the park proper.   If you like to do more hikes - then you might want 2 full days.    We took a major part of one day to drive down to Bass Harbor - and up along the Somes Sound - very pretty drive.    We also tooka day to drive over to Schoodic point - so worth the time.   You can see alot in a day - 2 days is probably about right for the main park.  But plan a third day to hit some of these outside locations.
Third week of September,Fun place to visit. We were able to find parking spots wherever we went even though there were three cruise ships that came into port.
How could you NOT love this beautiful National Park?,This was my first time ever to this Park and it did not disappoint.  It was very crowded on this Labor Day weekend - it probably would have been better a little later.  Parking in certain areas was very congested and we did not allow enough time to take the shuttle anywhere unfortunately.  We climbed the steps to the Visitors Center and browsed the center and I got my Passport stamped - very pretty center with a unique location (be prepared to climb!!!).
Beautiful Park,Stunning views and great walks.  We took so many pictures!  Will definitely be back for another visit.
Stunning views from this Island Park,"Acadia is unlike other national parks I've visited like Yosemite because it is primarily on an Island. There is a road the runs around the periferie of the park, but all traffic goes in only one direction. There are many hikes, but they are all fairly short - some more advanced than others. Acadia is a must-do experience if you're in Maine!"
"Great for Hiking, Driving...but Crowded","Acadia National Park on Mount Desert (pronounced 'Dessert' by locals) Island gives new meaning to the term picturesque. It includes some of the most beautiful scenery along the Atlantic Coast anywhere. We spent two weeks in or around Acadia and would perhaps do it again.We are not hikers anymore (age), but love to find beauty and if a car can get us there we are pleased to go. Here in Acadia one can see lovely seascapes filled with boulders and pine trees highlighted by the ocean and the sky. But also by tourists and cars. Acadia is not to be missed, but understand that you will not be the only people around.Bar Harbor borders Acadia, and is also charming, but filled with cruise ships and tourists and commercial shops where you can buy nearly everything. It's a nice small town, but usually pack jammed with people off the boats or in buses and cars.We were in Acadia in September after the Labor Day weekend and it was still busy.Nonetheless, this national park should be a must-visit for anyone who enjoys lovely coastal scenery--everything from Cadillac Mountain to coastal vistas and quaint towns somewhat less populated than Bar Harbor."
Very Picturesque,We really enjoyed our day spent in this beautiful park. It is especially vibrant when the colors of autumn are on full display. This is a must see while in the Bar Harbor area.
Breathtaking Vistas,"You can't go wrong with a visit to Acadia National Park. I've visited it many times via an assortment of transportation options. Whether you travel by narrated trolley (Oli's Trolley), car, or biking the carriage roads, every moment surrounded by nature, gorgeous sunsets/sunrises, boulders and flora will inspire you to return."
Beautiful Park,"We recently spent two days driving through Acadia National Park.  It was busy, but not near as crowded as it would be in the summer.  We  went about 8:00 in the morning and took the Park Loop Road.  We saw deer and wild turkeys both days.  One day we even saw harbor seals playing in the water.  Our favorite spot was Cadilac Mountain where you get a great view of the ocean.  There are a number of spots that you can stop and view the ocean. There is a certain amount of walking up a steep path or down a number of steps.  We saw plenty of seniors and they were able to handle them.  They had a bus that would take you through the park and a lot of them were using that.  We packed our lunch because we not sure how hard it would be to find food.  There isn't a lot of places to grab food inside the park, so we were glad we had our own.  It cost $25.00 for a 7 day pass to enter the park.  But because we had our senior card it was free!"
Perfect bike ride,"The carriage paths through the park made for great bike paths. The hills weren't too steep but they were long enough to make for a bit of a challenge. The Jordan Pond House was a great spot for lunch. The poppers, which were thelocal specialty, could only be beat but the view of the Bubbles Mountains."
Another wonderful National Park ,A bucket list check off for us.  ANP is wild and beautiful and I love that it is on the ocean AND in the mountains.  It is the perfect combination if you crave the sound of the sea or need to be on top of a mountain to refuel your soul.  A must visit!  Be sure to visit Jordan Pond House for their famous pop overs!
Nice Ride thru the Park,"Took a ride thru Acadia National Park and stopped at the sand beach.  Walked down to the beach from the road above the beach...great path to the beach...beautiful view of the ocean, rock formations. Stopped again up the road to see the waves crashing into the rock formation...couldn't go all the way down the path due to wet pavement!!  Still a beautiful view!  Enjoyed the day driving thru the park.   A must see road trip!"
Beautiful Park - Highly Accessible,"Beautiful National Park with all levels of hiking trails, fantastic ocean views, and easy access.  We visited in mid-September.  The carriage trails are easy bike and walking trails with a gravel surface. Some of the ""moderate to easy"" hiking trails require more rock scrambling than most 65 year-olds would like and then there are some serious rock climbing areas where we were content to just watch from afar. Be sure the trails are appropriate for your level of activity before you set out.  The Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, Jordon Pond, and Cadillac Mountain areas are not to be missed. Although parking is limited in some spots, we arrived at 9:15-9:30 on Cadillac Mountain and had no trouble finding parking. Jordon Pond has difficult parking at noon, because the Park's dinning is there; but it was fine by 1:30. A park road forms a loop through much of the park and a high percentage of the park highlights are very accessible from the road.  There are several entrances to the park from state highways.  The Park service also runs a bus service, which we were told was a very efficient way to see the park and avoid any parking issues.  We stayed in the park most of two days and really enjoyed it."
Beautiful views from Cadillac summit,"My wife and I spent the day at Acadia National Park. We went mid-morning to beat some of the crowds. Cadillac Mountain is the main attraction. There isn't a lot of parking. The views on a clear day are magnificent. There were several cruise ships in Bar Harbor which add a little twist to the panorama. I hadn't expected to see cruise ships there. We hiked a little around the top of the summit. There are plenty of trails. By the time we drove down the summit Jordan Pond was packed, so we simply drove around the park and along the coastline. Did a little shopping in a few of the harbors before stopping for the rest of the day at Bar Harbor. We had a perfectly clear day with temperatures in the upper 60s."
Breath-taking at every turn,"Like walking through endless postcards, Acadia is peaceful tranquility and stunning views at every turn.  From pop-overs at Jordan House on the shores of Jordan Pond to watching the sunrise at the top of Cadillac Mountain to the lighthouses and coves, Acadia is eye-popping splendor!"
Checkout Thunder Hole,"We took a bus tour of Acadia National Park as an excursion off our cruise ship.  The park is spectacular, especially Thunder Hole."
Summer cool in maine,"July is hot in Florida,however a Norwegian ship cruise out of New Jersey is just the ticket to sail north and enjoy the Maine coastline and Acadia national Park.atop the 2500 ft mountain you can see Russia,,,ok maybe not ,,,but a great viewpoint ,,enjoy bay harbor,small town with very friendly people"
Great View from Cadillac Mountain,"Unfortunately the trees had not begun to display their fall colors on our cruise stop last week.  Nonetheless, the views of Frenchman's Bay from the top of Cadillac Mountain were still spectacular.  Well worth the trip."
A Road Trip from New York to Acadia National Park,"It has been three weeks since we did our road trip to Acadia National Park in Maine.  Prior to the trip, I had committed to myself to document this trip and to write a review on TripAdvisor, as I had been benefiting from the reviews on TripAdvisor all these years, so it’s time for me to contribute my fair share.  Let’s get started.We are a family of four: my husband and I in our 50’s and our sons 19 and 14; and we live in western Nassau County on Long Island.  The trip was for eight days seven nights from 8/25/19 to 9/1/19.  We had initially wanted to make an overnight stop both on our way there and on our return trip.  We did stop for one night in Portland, Maine, going there.  However, we couldn’t find any hotel affordable on our way back, which was the Labor Day weekend, so we drove straight home.  Otherwise, we would like to stop at Kennebunkport in Maine or Providence in Rhode Island.Day 1: We left at 5:15 AM and followed the Waze directions.  Traffic was smooth and we arrived in Old Port District in Portland around 9:45 AM (don’t ask how fast we were driving).  Our first stop was The Holy Donut.  The wait was about 35 minutes, and we picked up six donuts (bacon cheddar, holy cannoli triple berry, sweet potato ginger glazed, Maine blueberry, dark chocolate sea salt and honey lavender), with coffee.  We had a couple of the donuts there and saved some for dessert later.  The bacon cheddar (savory) and dark chocolate sea salt were our favorite.  We then walked around Old Port District, which has plenty of shops, and had lunch at Portland Lobster Company, where we ordered lobster roll ($18 with fries), clam chowder, fried clams and steamers.  The food was overall good.  Next we headed to Portland Head Lighthouse in Fort Williams Park.  It is a large, beautiful waterfront park with big picnic areas equipped with barbeque grills.  There was a family grilling lobsters.  What a great idea!  We then went to Allagash Brewery but couldn’t make their tours, which require advance booking.  Anyway, we did the flight (four 3-oz. beer at $2-$3 each).  We then decided to have an early dinner before checking in our hotel and arrived at Duckfat around 4:45 PM. There was still a 45-minute wait.  We had charcuterie board with four items (chicken pate, ham, smoked salmon and smoked duck), poutine (fried in duck fat), duck confit panini, pull pork panini and brisket panini.  Duck is definitely their specialty and the poutine was sinfully delicious and worthy of every calorie.  We finally checked in Holiday Inn by the Bay after dinner.Day 2: We checked out the hotel at 10 AM and headed to the L.L. Bean flagship store 25 minutes away.  We found the merchandises at the flagship store very expensive, so we went to their outlet store across the street.  The outlet strip has many other stores such as Under Armor, Nike, Brooks Brothers, Gap, Banana Republic, etc.  After we left the outlet strip, we continued our way up north for about 40 minutes and stopped at Red’s Eats for lunch.  It was around 1 PM when we arrived.  The line didn’t look too bad, but boy, their service was extremely slow and we waited almost two hours.  During the wait, the staff passed out umbrellas, water and watermelon.  We ordered lobster roll ($24), fried clams, fried scallops and fried shrimps.  Note that it’s a cash-only place.  The lobster roll was both excellent in quality and quantity and the lobster meat was plump, tender and sweet.  But surprisingly good were the scallops, which we wished we had ordered more.  As we continued our trip, we made a side stop at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, approximately 75 minutes after Red’s Eats, to visit the school my husband went to over 30 year ago.  From there we drove to Bar Harbor another 90 minutes north.  Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island and we stayed in Bar Harbor, which town has the most tourists on the Island.  Note that cellular reception is spotty on the Island.  So make sure you sort of know your directions or have a satellite type GPS handy.  We stopped in downtown before checking in our hotel and had dinner at Blaze.  There was a 40-minute wait and we had mussels, pork belly lollipops, tacos and pizzas.  The pork belly lollipops were succulent and delicious.  The mussels and pizzas were also good, but the tacos were a little disappointing.Day 3: Acadia Inn offers free continental breakfast, so we had breakfast at the hotel every day before heading out.  We first headed to Hulls Cove Visitor Center.  Every car and every person needs to pay to access Acadia National Park ($30 per car or $15 per person for seven days).  The pass allows you to park in the Park and use the Island Explorer buses that essentially stop at all the points of interest on the Island.  We did not use the buses but I could definitely see the convenience of using them during the peak season, which had just ended the week before we were there.  Nonetheless, there were still a lot of cars and tourists, and parking is probably a nightmare during the peak season.  Also the buses can be useful for people who do one-way hikes.  At the Visitor Center, you can ask the park rangers questions and pick up a free map, which our hotel also offered.  There are additional hiking maps for sale for a few dollars.  There are many trails in the Park at various difficulty levels, so be aware of what you are getting on.  You can also research online.  We are not experienced hikers and we were not well equipped, so we stayed away from any hiking trails that mentioned iron rungs.  The Park offers ranger-led tours, some with a cost.  I would have taken the birdwatching tour but it was not available the week we were there.  I suppose the season for birdwatching had ended.  So after the Visitor Center, we got on Park Loop Road, which goes around the Park, to get a flavor of the Park.  Note that part of Park Loop Road is one way, so in order to do the full loop, you need to turn left at the sign that says one way only to Sand Beach, which comes up a little after the Cadillac Mountain entrance.  Our plan was to make a few stops and some short hiking along Park Loop Road.  We first stopped at Sieur de Monts, which has a garden, a nature center and a couple of short, easy trails.  We did the ½ mile Jesup Path there.  We then made a few stops, including Schooner Head Overlook (5-minute walk down); Sand Beach (equipped with bathroom and changing room); Thunder Hole (20 steps down the rocks); and Otter Point (not as pretty as Thunder Hole).  There are many pullovers in between.  We then stopped at Jordon Pond House to try their famous popovers.  We would have just ordered a few popovers for takeout and had them at a picnic table or bench.  But they do not allow popovers for takeout.  So after a 20-minute wait, we ordered some popovers, smoked salmon and cheese plate appetizers.  Their popovers did live up to the hype, but the rest was mediocre.  We then walked the 3.2-mile Jordan Pond Path that goes around the Pond.  The entrance is right next to the restaurant.  The park ranger had said it was an easy trail.  Well, we started the Path to the right (counterclockwise).  It was flat and easy in the beginning, but approximately two-thirds in, the Path became all rocks and wood planks.  The sign at the entrance of the Path says 2 1/2 hours; but we finished in 90 minutes.  Though it was not easy, it’s totally doable.  We then left the Park and headed to The Travelin’ Lobster for dinner.  It’s a shack with outdoor seating.  There was a 10-minute wait and we had clam chowder, lobster bisque, lobsters, mussels, lobster grilled cheese panini.  All were good.Day 4: The boys had booked a kayak tour for the afternoon at Marine State Sea Kayak, which is located in Southwest Harbor of the Island, approximately 20 minutes away from our hotel.  So we decided to explore Southwest Harbor a little in the morning.  We first headed to Charlotte Rhoades Park and Butterfly Garden.  It is a very small, but beautiful garden with a couple of waterfront picnic tables.  It is free, although they suggest donations.  We spent 30 minutes there.  Then we went to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse about 10 minutes away, which is a working lighthouse with someone living there.  The parking lot is very small, but there is not much to see other than the Lighthouse, so people typically come and go.  We spent approximately 15 minutes there.  Next we went to Thurston’s Lobster Pound 10 minutes away.  They have a covered dining area.  There were a lot of mosquitoes the day we went, no wonder bug spray was provided at the entrance to the dining area.  We only tried their lobster rolls, which were also good.  We then went to Main Street in Southwest Harbor about 15 minutes away and walked around the few blocks.  There are not many stores, but we liked Sawyer’s Market, a local grocery store.  We bought some wines, organic strawberries and a huge blueberry muffin (yum!) from there.  Then was the time to check in the boys at Marine State Sea Kayak.  Since there was not much else to do in Southwest Harbor, my husband and I headed back to the Bar Harbor downtown.  There we did the Shore Path, which is a waterfront path, one mile one-way.  Use Google map to Bar Harbor Town Pier and start the Path there.  The Path is parallel to Main Street, so when you finish the Path, you can walk a couple of blocks down to Main Street, and walk back to your starting point from there.  There are plenty of shops on or near Main Street.  We had ice cream at Mount Desert Island Ice Cream and tried strawberry, lemon poppy berry swirl and cafe breve flavors.  After a few hours of shopping, we went back to Marine State Sea Kayak to pick up the boys, who said they had a great time and saw seals, porpoises, bald eagles and other birds.  For dinner, we were looking for Italian, not just pizza.  There’s definitely a shortage of Italian restaurants in Bar Harbor.  We ended up at Mama DiMatteos in downtown and had pizza and pasta, which were all quite good.  Also the restaurant has its own parking lot, which is a gem for downtown.Day 5: It was a rainy day, the only one during our stay there.  It’s a challenge to find things to do since there are not much indoor activities on the Island.  We had planned to go to the Northeast Harbor Farmers Market, which is on Thursdays only and about 20 minutes away.  There is another Farmers Market in Bar Harbor on Sundays, but we were not there on either Sunday before or after.  We went anyway and were disappointed to see only a few vendors open.  After a little research, we decided to go back to the towns before the bridge to Mount Desert Island, since there are more big name retail stores to spend a rainy day in.  One of the beauties with Mount Desert Island is there are no chain or franchise stores on the Island.  Anyway, we found a place called Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques in Ellsworth, which is the town before Trenton, which is before the bridge.  It took us approximately 45 minutes to get there.  Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques, as it is called, is a big barn that sells old books and stuffs.  I’m not sure if they are antiques but they are old.  After that, we were going to go to a TJ Maxx just to stay indoor, but we saw a Renys, which is a local discount store, so we shopped there instead.  There is a L.L. Bean outlet across from Renys.  On our way back, right before the bridge, we stopped at Trenton Bridge Lobster Pound and tried their lobster, lobster rolls and clam chowder.  The food was just as good as other places.  We were then back on the Island and headed to Atlantic Brewing Company on Knox Road.  We arrived there 10 minutes before their next tour and were fortunate enough to get a spot.  Their tours are free on a first-come first-serve basis.  The tour was informative and fun and they were very generous with their beer tasting (soda for the kids).  They also run a barbeque restaurant next door, Mainely-Meat Bar-B-Que, where we had their Max Plate samplers, which was a lot of food for a good price.  So this rainy day turned out not bad for us.Day 6: We wanted to do some hiking for our final two days and decided on two longer trails: the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road.  These are carriage roads and are flat and wide, suitable for bikes and dogs.  In the hindsight, it’d be more fun for the boys to bike on these carriage roads instead, as they found them boring.  There is a small parking lot with a sign “Eagle Lake Carriage Road” on Route 233, which is approximately ¾ mile east of Google map “Carriage Road” destination.  From this parking lot, you walk a one-mile path and choose the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road on one side and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road on the other.  We did the 5.5-mile Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road, saving the Eagle Lake Carriage Road for the following day.  Afterwards, we headed to Indian Point Blagden Preserve about 15 minutes away.  It’s a little known place with some trails that lead to the water.  The Big Wood Trail there was unmarked, so we instead took the road down (there are some private properties along the road) and then took the Shore Trail, altogether about 1.5 miles one way.  We were hoping to see some wildlife but were disappointed as we only saw a deer.  Our plan for the day was to watch sunset that evening, so we headed back to Acadia National Park.  To kill some time, we did another trail up to Bubble Rock.  The parking lot for this trail is between Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond on Park Loop Road.  The trail is only ½ mile one way but it is rocky and uphill, so it was a little challenging (I learnt that my memory foam shoes were not made for hiking).  There is an intersection midway and we took the south trail.  The view up there was gorgeous.  Since it was too early for sunset, we went to Jordan Pond House for an early dinner, mostly for their popovers again.  There was no wait and we had popovers, lobster salad, lobster, scallops, crab and lobster cakes, and BLTT sandwich (I know it’s a lot of food).  Again, other than the popovers, the rest was mediocre especially considering the price.  After dinner, we drove up Cadillac Mountain to Blue Hill Overlook, which faces west, for sunset.  There is a sign for Blue Hill Overlook Parking before reaching the top.  It was very cold and windy, but the sunset was absolutely beautiful.Day 7: We went back to the same parking lot as the day before, looking to do the 6-mile Eagle Lake Carriage Road.  That parking lot, however, was full and we found another parking lot across, which is for Eagle Lake only.  There is a kayak/boat launch area at the entrance.  We went clockwise around the Lake, as we were told it was easier.  Approximately two miles in, there was an option to continue on carriage road or take a 1.2-mile Eagle Lake Trail that tugs around the lake.  Since the boys were bored by the carriage road, we took the Eagle Lake Trail, which was quite rocky.  The trail eventually merges back on the carriage road.  Since we had now worked up our appetite, and the boys had not checked out the Bar Harbor downtown (they were taking a kayak tour when we spent an afternoon there), we went there again.  We went to Bar Harbor Popcorn and had their blueberry and cheddar popcorns, and then CJ’s Ice Cream & Yogurt and had their blueberry soft serve.  They were all fantastic.  We then walked around the shops, relaxed at the Town Pier a little, and since it was low tide, we were able to walk across the Sand Bar to Bar Island (look for sign and direction at the Town Pier).  We were quite exhausted after all that and had an early dinner at The Stadium Restaurant and Gallery.  This restaurant accepts reservations for lobster dinner, which is great if you are tired of waiting.  For $30, you get a 1.25 lb. lobster, clam chowder, cornbread, coleslaw and corn.  We did not expect so much food and we also ordered burger and hot dogs as well.  The food was great and the staff was even greater.  It was a perfect meal to wrap up our stay at Mount Desert Island.Day 8: This was our day of departure and we had approximately eight hours of driving to get home.  So we got up very early and headed to Cadillac Mountain for sunrise, which is supposedly the first sunrise of the day in America.  We arrived at the Cadillac Mountain summit at 4:45 AM.  At that time, the parking lot was almost full.  Although we were better prepared than the day we watched sunset, it was even colder.  But it was absolutely worth it and the sunrise was amazing.  Leaving Cadillac Mountain took a little time due to everyone leaving at the same time.  On our return trip home, we stopped at Maine Diner in Wells for brunch.  Wells is a town adjacent to Kennebunkport and this diner was seen in triple D on Food Network.  The wait was about 30 minutes and the food was good diner food at a good price.  We then drove straight home without incidence.To sum up, it was a wonderful trip that I think everyone should take at least once in their lifetime.  All the people we came across were very kind and nice, and not once we felt we were treated differently or anything less (we are Chinese).  We found both Portland and Mount Desert Island very family friendly, dog friendly and LGBT friendly, and we felt welcomed everywhere we went.  The only disappointment with this trip was the scarcity of wildlife we saw, which I suppose was due to the season.After almost 20 lobster rolls, our survey (n=4) came to a unanimous decision: Red’s Eats was the best.  Would we wait two hours again?  Probably not, but I’ve been told that the line could be much shorter on a rainy day or if you arrive in the late afternoon.  So time your visit wisely."
Beautiful park.,Beautiful park. Great hiking trails with plenty to explore.  Free bus provided by LL Bean made getting around easy.
Beautiful views,"Really enjoyed hiking here for the views from the top. I hiked the Bowl trail while my husband hiked the Beehive. I’m afraid of heights and could tell from the parking lot that I could not handle the Beehive. I visited The Bowl (pond) and took a trail that took us to the coastline. Also hiked Acadia and Saint Sauveur Mountain trails.  Enjoyed it very, very much. Challenging but rewarding!"
Beautiful,"This is our 38th National Park visited.  Definitely in the top five.  Great views, easy to get around using the hop on hop off bus."
Jewel of the northeast,"This is one of the most beautiful parks in the National Park System, with gorgeous ocean views, forest-covered mountains, and quiet inland lakes. Take the Park Loop Road to see most of it, but walk or bike some of the 54 miles of carriage roads to see what far fewer people get to see."
The park is suited for all types of travelers.,"We like to hike, can also drive to everything. beautiful scenery including Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and Cadillac Mountain. We also drove the Schoodic Scenic Byway. Had popovers and tea at Jordan pond. If you like flower gardens and landscapes Thuya Garden Lodge and Asticou Azalea Garden"
Beautiful Scenery and a variety of sights,"We spent a good part of the day exploring Acadia National park. It is a true gem as advertised. The sights are many and varied from up on high at Cadillac Mountain to low on Jordan Pond. You can visit riding in your car around Loop Road if hiking is not your strong suit, or you can hike till your hearts content with the many trails that are well marked. For us, the view atop Cadillac Mt. was the best and can only be reached by car."
Sunrise ,Get to the top of Cadillac Mountain about an hour or so before sunrise. It was cold and breezy but oh my God the view. Just a light cloud cover helped make this one of the most beautiful sunrises I have ever seen. A must do.
Beautiful views no matter where you look.,"We spent a few hours in the park, drove up to Cadillac Mountain, stopped at Sandy Shore and got some gorgeous pictures of Jordon's Pond.    A great place to walk and get some beautiful pictures."
A Girls Trip (family-(sisters and niece),"Acadia National Park is a magnificent creation from the rock formations to the mountains to the trees and the various water views. The carriage ride and having popovers at Jordan’s Pond were so enjoyable. The staff at each venue was helpful, polite, knowledgeable, and made great recommendations. We definitely would return."
Spectacular!,"Plenty to do and see whether you’re a hiker or not. An abundance of wildlife, mountains, overlooks and lakes.  Don’t miss shopping on Main St in Baal Harbor after-park.  .And be sure to buy a blueberry ice cream cone when you’re there!"
Natural beauty,"I must confess we didn't venture far off the Park Loop Road, but everything we saw & did was breathtakingly beautiful & blissfully serene. I could write what's on the tourism brochures, but words aren't enough. Go see for yourself!!!!!Tips: Dogs are allowed almost everywhere, but some places were really busy & our dogs were a bit overwhelmed. Sand Beach is dog-friendly only after September 8th.Thunder Hole isn't always thunderous. Check tide tables &/or ask a Ranger for the most likely times to see/hear the phenomenon.About half of Park Loop Road is one way. We found out the hard way & had to backtrack to the top of the loop to get to the other side."
Outstanding National Park,"Rangers were very friendly, helpful and quite knowledgeable.  There are many many outstanding locations from which to obtain great photos."
A delight,"Splendid National Park, interestingly established through the generosity of families with houses on the island, particularly the Rockefellers."
Beautiful Rocky Coast,"We have been four times, twice with our children in the summer, once in May, and once in October.  Traffic was bumper to bumper getting into Bar Harbor in the summer, but we managed to drive the Loop Road without much of a problem.  It was not that crowded in May or October as it was off season.  Highlights are: Thunder Hole (but stay away from the edge), Jordan Pond, and the best is Cadillac Mountain on a clear day.  Make sure you see the Southeast Harbor part of the park.  We even went to the northern portion of the park.  We went on the Carriage Roads which didn't impress, but it was in the rain so the weather may have been a factor. Make sure you walk around at Cadillac Mountain.  Try Old Soaker blueberry soda at Jordan Pond, only place to eat in the park. There are moose, bears, seabirds and whale watching off the coast. Precipice Trail can be dangerous. Good park for all ages."
Terrific views. ,During our stay at Bar Harbor we took a coach trip through Acadia National Park and up through the mountains. There are terrific views with plenty of photo stops en route and we noticed how clean the air is. We spotted Bold Eagle which was a bonus. We would recommend this trip when passing through the area.
A wonderful experience,"We drove through the park and stopped to take pictures at the many stops on a beautiful cool September day in Maine. It was not too crowded, but still busy for this time of year.  I would recommend buying a Senior Pass for all of our national parks, as it saved us the $30 fee for driving through. On days like today, the scenery pictures of the ocean, islands and general landscape are spectacular."
A wonderful national treasurer,"If you can, please go see and experience this wonderful place.  Rain or shine, you won't be disappointed.  Even you do not hike, you can still enjoy the beauty."
Beautiful and HUGE,"This park is amazing and offers unlimited hiking, walking, and biking for all levels of difficulty. It's huge and you could spend a week here and not scratch the surface. It's very crowded at the restaurant and other public places but the trails are so plentiful that they stay relatively sparse. Beautiful views."
Well worth a visit.,"Splendid views from loop road which you can drive around, with stopping places at various points. Up to you whether you have a lot or a little exercise as there are plenty of walks.  Well signed with information at stopping places."
Loop Road through Acadia National Park,"Driving the loop road through the park is wonderful. There are many places to stop and enjoy the views. Other places you can get out and walk around. Even if you aren't up to hiking any of the trails, it's still a beautiful ride."
WOW!,"Of all the places we visited during our recent trip to Maine, both my husband and I thought our brief time (one morning) in Acadia was the highlight. Glad we listened to the park staff who recommended starting early; even in September, popular areas were very crowded by midday."
Spectacular!,"My husband loves to hike - therefore, I Hike! However, if you are not a big fan of hiking don't feel like you can't do this park. You can absolutely see many things with little walking. There is a loop around the park that you drive. Stop to see what you want. If you do like to hike - this place is one see or do. The views are breathtaking. The cost to enter park is $30/ vehicle. Go with friends and split the cost."
Nice Off Season,"Crowds are minimal, less waiting, but parking is still an issue.  Take the park loop bus!  Something for everyone. See Thunder Hole 2 hours before high tide."
Beautiful,This is a beautiful place to visit. There are so many lovely views across the bay and down to the harbour. It is quite busy but well worth a visit.
America's most awesome treasure,"Although The Grand Canyon always takes 1st place, Acadia National Park is equally as awesome. The park is huge, clean and accessible by car, local bus service from Maine's well-known retailer L.L.Bean and a trolly out of Bar Harbor. There are plenty of hotels, motels, cottages and campgrounds in the area. Cadillac Mountain offers the best views of Bar Harbor and awesome sunrises and sunsets. Jordan Pond offers easy walking trails and a restaurant. And the tee-shirts in the gift shop are made in America, which is often not the case at many other national parks. We've visited this park 4 times and will definitely visit again."
Exceptional views,The Acadia National Park had some of the most spectacular views of the rocky Maine coastline of the Atlantic ocean.  Good paved roads.  Highly recommend.  Rating... awesome.
Great Visit,We had a great day at this National Park. We spent about 6 hours in the park stopping at all of the major attractions. Took some great walks on very well maintained trails. Stopped at the Jordan Pond House for our popovers. They were delicious. We were surprised that in what is not a prime season that parking was limited and waits significant.
Bus tour of Acadia National Park,Great park. Definitely worth the trip.  The bus tour takes you around the park loop so you see most of the highlights of the park. The guide also adds a touch of history and interesting facts.  Bar Harbor is a beautiful town and definitely a must see.
Terrific Park,Great views of the craggy shoreline from the ocean path. Runs from Sand Beach to Otter Cliffs. Numerous parking lots along the way. Go to Jordan Pond early one day so you won't have to hunt for a parking space ( if you can find one at all). People tend to stay several hours there.
Great park,"We have been to many national parks, and this one did not disappoint.  Very scenic views, good hiking paths, a bit crowded, however with parking hard to find in spots.  Carriage roads very nicely maintained and fun to bike or walk on."
CONFUSING PARK,"This National Park has been on my list for awhile.  Preparing for this trip looking by looking on the Park website, what the NPS doesn't prepare you for, is the amount of time driving for destinations.  The distances aren't long, but the speed limits are 30-50MPH.  There are five basic destinations, SW Harbor, NE Harbor, the Park Loop, and Bar Harbor, and the Schoodic peninsula,  I stayed at the Seawall NP campground, on the SW Harbor, which is about 40 minutes away from the visitors center.  There are local showers available 9AM-6PM daily except for Sunday, as the local store is closed.  Other campgrounds refuse campers to buy on for a shower.  The option is to travel to Blackwoods NP, which has 24 hr showers daily, which is about 50 minutes away.  The hiking on trails are steep, crawling over granite rocks and hikers are guided by blue paint on rocks and trees.  Many intersecting  trails from the main trail, as plotted by the NPS Acadia hiking map can not be found.  Some trail heads are readily seen from the park roads, and some are only designated by a carved stumped which can be easily overlooked.  Driving from the east side to the west side and vice versa is especially confusing, as to travel transversely, the driver must essentially make a U turn outside of Bar Harbor to turn around.  Th e parking lots for the trail heads are small, so one needs to start early.  Since most of the attractions are on the east side with the parking lot, it makes more sense to find lodging in the center of the island or on the east side.I'm glad I visited, but I didn't fall in love with the park, as millions have."
Wonderful views!,Visited in mid-October and was treated to almost peak fall colors.  Went to the top of Cadillac Mountain but the pull offs near the top had the best views rather than the peak in my opinion.  I watched sunrises on one side and went over the easily walkable rock to view the sunsets. Bring a jacket or long sleeves as it tended to be windy up there at night. So many wonderful views and lots of wildlife in the park.
Just Plain Beautiful,Bought the weekly vehicle pass which is well worth it. Did the entire  loop around park and made any stops at various places. You can stop at any designated place you want and spend as much time as you want. Pictures are required. Its hard to imagine all the beauty of this gem.
Beautiful,"Beautiful park with many options for all ability levels to hike, bike or just drive.    The shuttle from Bar Harbor is free and easy to use.   We spent 4 days there but will be back for more."
Perfect visit -- don't skip this!!,"It was NOT crowded when we went and we had an amazing time. The key to visiting this park is to time it correctly. September was great -- no leaf color, so what? Also no crowds. We went on one of the more popular hikes totally alone, not seeing a soul, in the early morning, and we loved it so much. The park is amazingly beautiful. Check the tide schedules, the cruise ships arrivals, and don't be too concerned about the weather dress for it and embrace the fog or whatever. Cadillac Mtn. -- you don't have to go at sunrise or sunset to love it. We went well after sunrise and it was still gorgeous. Thunder Hole when not thundering -- so what ... the view was still awesome. Do the stuff you want to do early in the day and be flexible."
"If you can Get here, you need to Come here.","I was very hesitant about actually coming into the state park because of my mobility issues.  I am not in a wheelchair or use a walker or cane but probably should..  Anyway, going to the top of Cadillac mountain to see the sunrise and the sunset is a Must for anyone who can Get there.  We were pleasantly surprised that there were places that Didn't require a hike to see the views.  I highly recommend a trip here at least once during your lifetime.  Just the drive to Jordan Pond, Cadillac Mountain was worth it.  We also ventured down to Thunder hole and even though it was not Thundering at the top it was still noteworthy~"
Wow! Simply Breathtaking! Awesome!,"If you are in Maine, this is a must see. It is a national park that is awesome! 26 or so miles with different areas to see as you drive the route. You can hike just about hike anywhere on the mountain. Be careful, there aren't many restrictions on what you can and can not climb. We started at Sand Beach, beautiful but the water was cold and it was August. Then off to Thunder Hole, now we were there during low tide and it looked like a bath tub. However, when the tide erupts, this water shoots up 20 feet or higher. Off to Cadillac Mountain, simply breathtaking. It is at the high point of the park, you can see for miles. Watch the cruise ships disembarking or just enjoy the scenery. Take some pictures and again be careful."
Beautiful park in the NE.,There are several sites to see in the park.  Our favorite was Thunderhole and the carriage trails.  There are lots of hiking trails. There are several options to view the park from the water.  We stayed in Bar Harbor and used the free Island Explorer shuttle to get around in the park. It was wonderful. Well worth the trip!
Mid-September visit,"Can’t say enough about Acadia. Hike, bike kayak, shop in Bar Harbor, schooner rides. Beautiful hiking and carriage trails. Lots to see and do. Weather mid-September has been sunny and low 60’s every day"
Lots of People,"Lots of fellow visitors  should tell you that this is the place to be.  And, it is if you live far away and this adds to your National Park bucket list.  Well worth the trip - once.  We came during the week in mid/early September to avoid the summer and Fall Foliage crowds.  Didn’t seem to matter as Bar Harbor seemed packed and the park attractions were crowded.  I say crowded but what does that mean?  I can’t believe what it must be in the regular summer.  The cruise ships alone must dump thousands every day.  But there is fun here.  Lots of it if you like to hike, bike or kayak.  The Carriage Roads are wonderful to hike or run on.  Get in a few beautiful, quiet miles.  You can bike on them too.  Everyone looks like they’re having fun.  The views are wonderful and the sights worth seeing - once.  Now if I lived in New England, I might come more often just to run, hike and bike.  Otherwise, pick your time carefully and enjoy."
"Beautiful, great hiking","Beautiful park.  Wonderful trails for hiking for all levels.  from taking little ones around the lake to scrabbling up cliffs, trails for all.  They are well marked.  Parking is the only issue here especially in high season.  So plan your days accordingly.  Worth spending several days here exploring."
WONDERFUL! BEAUTIFUL!,We spent 3 days hiking...i figured we could see this small park in 3 days...and we saw a lot but cant wait to return as 3 days were nkt enough!!
Amazing!,Park is beautiful.  Check port schedule to go on a day when no cruise ships port to avoid larger crowds and traffic.
Views excellent. Dress for all weather,"The day started cool with a cloudless blue sky.  By 1 pm, it was fully overcast. By 4, you needed that sweatshirt you took off in the morning. The views are excellent throughout the park. Trails of varying length and difficulty. I recommend the free buses that roam the park and Bar Harbor. You do have to be able to follow the routes and schedules. Someone was as the Village Green and at Jordan Pond to make sure everyone got on the correct bus. Sure beats trying to see the sights, watch for other cars and pedestrians and trying to find a place to park."
Acadia National Park,Really nice park.  Visited on a cruise as an excursion trip and loved it.  Huge park.  Wish we could have spent more time there.
Beautiful Day in a Beautiful Park!,"From the loop road, to the Sand Beach, to Jordan Pond, to Cadillac Mountain it is about as good as it gets! It starts at the entrance with a very knowledgable National Park employee giving us great information at the get go!Roads are in great shape and plenty of road signs to direct you around. You can also stop on numerous places to get that post card perfect picture!Although it did get crowded at the top of Cadillac Mtn it was well worth the wait! Recommend going up early (4-5am) it still is crowded with people going up for sunrise! We went up after that around 7:30 and it was still crowded...Jordan's Pond got busy too, but we made it before the tour buses and others got there...At 9 am lot was full as was trail around pond...If in the area you have to visit this American gem!"
Incredible views!,"We took a bus tour, which limited walking around.  But we heard so much history that we felt it was worth it."
Must-see National Park!,"This is one of those trips where we didn't do much research and just kind of showed up at Acadia. Wow! We had no idea it was rated one of the top 5 National Parks for views. Seriously...we experienced breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding islands at every turn. We started at Park Loop Road and hiked Cadillac Mountain, Jacobs Pond, and The Great Head Trail at Sand Beach over a 2-day visit. But first, I recommend you stop at the Visitor Center to pick up a map and ask a Park Ranger to recommend hikes based on your skill level. That was very helpful for us. Also, arrive early to get parking...we tried to get to Sand Beach around noon (first week of Sept) and the lot was already full. We wished we had a couple more days to explore more of Acadia. I'm soooo glad we went!"
I wish I could have stayed longer,"Only had a few days, but loved cycling the carriage trails, hiking the beehive and catching sunrise at Cadillac Mountain. Warning, it's super cold and windy. I wish I had brought my ski jacket!"
Beautiful,Took the self guided drive and it was amazing. Absolute breath taking views. It was off season and still pretty crowded. Not into the hiking part but saw many doing just that. Could have spent a coule days digging in to all the sights here.
Don't miss it.,"Acadia is a great park, have been there many times in the past the last time was about 20 years ago. The downside is it too popular and the number of people going make it too crowded. The best bet is to go to schoodic section of the park. You now need a pass to get into the park."
Stunning!,"I am still struggling to believe that I have live most of my life less than 300 miles from this wonderful place, and had not visited before. What a treasure. We rented a house for the week to drop our elder son off t the University of Maine for his freshman year, and to explore the area. Great decision! We hiked Acadia on three separate days, covering Beehive (wow!), Cadillac Mountain and Bubble Rock, with the requisite stroll around Jordan Pond. The natural history, terrain and views of the surrounding area are breathtaking. Don't miss it. Have popovers and blueberry iced tea (or blueberry soda!) at the Jordan House for lunch, then dine pretty much anywhere in Bar Harbor afterward."
360 Degrees of Stunning views,"A magnificent park.  You felt a peace and tranquility in what nature had to offer.  When we arrived in early morning it was shrouded in fog layers, as these dissipated the true stunning landscape was revealed.  Afterwards we enjoyed a lobster bake back in town."
Stunning scenery and pristine lakes,Go see Acadia National Park. We hiked around Jordan Pond and walked on Sand Beach and hiked the Great Head Trail. Go up to Cadillac Mountain to see the unbelievable view. Walk out to Bar Island on the land bridge at low tide. Go see the Bass Harbor Head Light and walk on the pink granite shoreline. There’s so much to do. The REI app (iPhone) was a huge help in finding the right trails with the desired level of difficulty and the offline map and gps integration means it works without a cell signal. Loved it there. (View from Cadillac mountain)
Gorgeous landscape ,We enjoyed several days in Acadia National Park. Just follow the Park Loop and discover beautiful places along. Gorgeous coastline and quite bicycle paths. Catching the sunrise from the top of Cadillac Mountain was spectacular. Lots to do in Acadia. Hope we will back soon 😁
Can’t be beat for ocean and mountains!,Peaceful - no matter how crowed there are quiet places. Great easy walks and Jordan Pond is beautiful. Tea and popovers are a must with seating on the lawn.
Gorgeous Park,Stunning views.  Rocky cliffs.  Trails.  Cooler temperatures.  What is not to love about Acadia National Park?
Breathtaking scenary,"My husband and I went to Acadia National Park recently and were so happy that we did!  It is so beautiful.  Cadillac Mountain was great for hiking and the scenary at the top was breathtaking.  We took a horse drawn carriage ride through the park, and went to Sand Beach with is worth the stop."
Beautiful park,We came here after a coworker recommended. The park did not disappoint. Lots of hiking with different skill levels . There is a stable that offers carriage rides on the trails that go into where cars can’t. The views are spectacular we will return!
Gorgeous,We enjoyed several days in Acadia.  We had a fun and challenging hike around Jordan Pond; great views on Cadillac Mountain and enjoyed the views and splashing water at Thunder Hole.
Serenity,"Spent the day driving through the east side of the park.  The vistas at every turn was amazing. Since it was after labor day, there was hardly any crowds and we had most of the area to ourselves. As breath taking and serene as the views were at Frazer point, it was even more fantastic at the southern tip of Arey Cove road. It’s definitely the less travelled section of the park which equates to more near perfect photo ops."
Beautiful in every way,This is a wonderful park.   Easy access but challenging trails if you want them.    Carriage roads are fantastic to bike on.   Jordan Pond Lodge is a great place to get a popover.    Little nooks and crannies everywhere are gems.   I'll go back over and over again.   Use the Island Explorer!   Best free bus system ever.
Great destination ,Traveling as a senior and having the pass was a plus. The views and activities will bring us back. Harbor views were stunning as well as the lakes; Jordan’s Pond; popovers and the cool climate. Schedule enough time and enjoy.
Service employee Rob,Beautiful tour and Rob very informative.Site are wonderful. We made stops and was able to walk around and take pictures.
Easily accessible National Park,"I wish I could hike here every day.  It's well maintained, people seem to be respectful, great hikes, wonderful views.  The rangers we ran into were always pleasant and helpful.  Bathrooms, while basic, were clean and maintained."
Worth The Trip From California,"My husband and I spent 2-1/2 days at Acadia N.P. Drove the Loop Rd., went to the top of Cadillac Mtn., biked on carriage roads around Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond, and a boat trip out of Southwest Harbor. Don’t miss walking to Bar Island at low tide.Advisory:  Parking is limited at the top of Cadillac Mtn., but there is a parking lot slightly below the summit that is only about a five minute walk away.FYI:  Bicycling the carriage road south along the west side of Eagle Lake is much harder than using the carriage road along the east side of the lake."
Wonderful views and exercise,"Love my Silver Pass to the National Parks.  We drove the loop road, walked some of the trails and Eagle Lake carriage trail. One day was glorious and we had a picnic on the rocks just off the loop road. The other day was low ceiling and some rain, but the carriage trail was not too wet to walk.  Look forward to our next trip."
Our favorite National Park to visit,"We look forward to visiting Acadia each year, hiking different trails, biking the carriage roads, and enjoying lobster at our favorite lobster pounds. We especially enjoy hiking The Bubbles, Goreham Mountain, Wonderland, and Flying Mountain Trails.  It’s fun to drive the Park Loop Road at different times of the day to experience it in the sun, in the fog and also in the rain, each one being a totally different experience."
Beautiful Place to Visit in Fall Season and Enjoy Nature's True Colour,"Acadia is one of the most beautiful destination in Fall Season. It has many points to visit. It also has a small beach known as Sand Beach. Water will be cold in Fall Season but still I would suggest to visit the point. There is very nice scenic view such as Thunder Hole, Monument Cove and few Cliffs are on the way. It is one of very scenic points of Acadia. Do not miss it. If visiting nature in Horse Cart interest you, there is a place to visit but you need to book that in advance, plan your visit at least for 2-3 days and try to visit all points of it. It has several points for Hikers too. It's booklet has all the information about hike trails and routes."
Arcadia National,"A wonderful, peaceful national park.  It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  Weather was great.  Park was very clean."
Beautiful,One of my favorite national parks yet. We did the beehive and hiked Sargent Mountain. Both were spectacular.
Great Head Trail ,"We took the recommendation of our B&B owner to do the Great Head Trail (bear Sand Beach) and it was a great suggestion - very few people, nice ocean views and pretty easy (for people who are generally in shape). NOTE - we encountered people with babies, people wearing flip flops and people who were clearly not in good shape - assess the trails and your personal situation to align before you go on any trail!"
beautiful park,"the park is nicely maintained. Views are stunning, Trees, beaches, mountains, everything so perfectly fit together. The shuttle bus is very nice and convenient."
Bar Harbor is  a great place to visit with family,"Beautiful place. It has something for everyone in the family. It has hiking trails, beaches, beautiful ponds, scenic mountains, and breathtaking scenery."
Incredible sights await you here.,This national park is a treasure. We drove the loop road and really enjoyed it. Views of land and sea. We stopped in Northeast Harbor for some window shopping.
Exquisite nature,Beautiful place to visit and enjoy nature at its finest. So many beautiful vistas - pictures just don’t do it justice at all.
Wish we could go every year,My family (7 and 9 year olds) absolutely loved exploring and hiking in the park. Every view is beautiful and there are so many hiking options. We can't wait to go back!
Beautiful Park,Driving or riding through the park you will experience some of the most beautiful views in the country. While riding on the bus you can ride for free from the visitor's center to any point in the Park. I even saw an Elk. At first I thought it was a Moose. But once I got to see the nose I knew it was an Elk.I saw lobster traps being brought on board and the fisherman emptying them and re-baiting them and returning them to the ocean floor. The sounds of the waves hitting the shore and seeing the views from the top of Cadillac Mountain is all you need to do to forget about any problems you think you have. The visitor's bus does not go to the top of Cadillac Mountain. But you can drive up to the top or take a private bus.
Great location to take in the Maine coaast,"I took the bus tour that gives the history of the area, it was really interesting.  Views from Cadillac Summit are amazing.  The paths are easy to walk on, although I went off path to get some pictures of the sea.  There are a couple of gift shops if you need a snack or bathroom."
Love it!,"5th time at Acadia!  I wish I could bring it and the ocean home with me in Pennsylvania!  I have been on the Beehive twice, not this time.  Love the trails along the ocean, and the big boulders in the woods as well as along the ocean.  So peaceful to just sit ant listen to the ocean against the waves!"
Worth every minute you spend there,"If you’re anywhere close to the park make time to go there. If you can get someone else to do the driving. Oli’s Trolley is a great one as you get a commentary and there are free busses fromBar Harbor Village Green just make sure you go. The scenery is truly awe inspiring.  Check out the pink granite cliffs, thunder hole, and, of course, Cadillac Mountain for amazing views of the area."
Not what we are accustomed to in National Parks,"Most of the reviews we read lacked critical attention to the fact that the park is more suitable for younger and more physically active visitors. We can not bike or hike so we took a bus ride that pointed out highlights but we did not drive the roads. Traffic was chaotic at best.  We also find more park stores and restaurants in other areas. This store was small and very limited in souvenir selection. At least we can say, ""been there"" to this one."
One of the prettiest places in the United States,The view from Cadillac mountain will astound you.  Lots of pull offs to enjoy views and hike. The carriage tour looks fun
Doesn’t cease to amaze,"What a gem of a park. Lovely trails all well marked, amazing views, convenient shuttle service and ample parking (often on the roads) makes this a great place to come back to. I just wish the ranger at the information center was a bit more helpful but otherwise we enjoyed coming back and look forward to our next visit."
Trails for all level of hikers with beautiful views.,Very doable trails to enjoy ocean and mountain views.  Also great carriage trails for a wonderful bike ride.
Must do,"Wow. Acadia is just amazing. There are trails and sights for all hiking and walking abilities. Visitor centers, Water refill stations, Bathrooms and changing rooms in strategic locations. The train ls are well marked. A visitor pass is required - we were never asked to produce but we did leave in car. Parking is tedious at some popular spot. The bus is helpful unless you are impatient because it can be slow. Lots of cute memorabilia in the visitor center at reasonable prices (benefits Acadia). After Acadia, I want to explore other national parks. Amazing"
Acadia ,"Very nice easy drive, crowded. This is a small national park and easy to see in a car. Clean visitors centers. We saw deer."
Stunning Park,"This national park is absolutely magnificent. It is breath-takingly beautiful at every single turn. There are so many different magical elements to this park from the Sand Beach, to the Thunder Hole, to Cadillac Mountain, to the Bee Hive Trail, to Jordan Pond, to Seal Harbor, to Bass Head Light House to.....There is something for every type of traveler here. There’s great hiking that range in difficulty level, there’s great beaches at the lakes and ponds to relax in, there’s beautiful scenery and trees. There’s just so much beauty. This park is a real stunner and had been on our list for a long time. So glad we finally came and I can’t recommend it enough. Hopefully, these beautiful lands stay protected."
2 day stay,Spent 2 days in the park.  Walked around Jordan's Pond-excellent.  Went to Cadillac Mtn.  Did other hikes as well.  The views are spectacular.
Lots of easy and beautiful hiking,"Acadia, we believe is the oldest National Park east of the Mississippi River. Highlights include Cadillac Mountain and it’s summit, Jordan Pond and more. There are old carriage roads that are perfect for walking, hiking and biking. The free Island Explorer bus service can take one and their bikes from the parking lot at the visitor site - no need to drive on the park roads."
Gorgeous!,We toured the park earlier this week on a sunny day. We toured today on an overcast day. It’s spectacular and the rangers are so friendly.
Beautiful.. but crazy packed with visitors,There are plenty of amazing views . But parking after 11am is lined up and down the roads. People are everywhere and secluded hikes are rare
Beautiful National Prk,"Acadia is a beautiful ,well kept national park. It was raining one day we were there, so we downloaded the app and followed an audio tour in the car. It worked out beautifully. Wish we had more time to spend there!"
Wonderful ,We had a wonderful time in Acadia. There are sightseeing and hiking options at all levels of difficulty.
A week in Maine,"Spent several days touring Acadia. We went to all the popular spots like Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, Sand Beach and much more. Great place to hike."
Have a plan to get in and out as early as possible,"Started the day with the drive up to Cadillac mountain to see the sunrise...with about 500 other people...on a TUESDAY.  Seriously, if you want to stay sane, get there super early (like at least 1 hour prior to sunrise) if you want to even think of getting parking spots.  Be prepared to share the ""peaceful"" sunrise with TONS of other people.  Go into that with that mindset and you'll be ok.Bring breakfast and stay up there for a while after sunrise, the people clear out quickly and you'll avoid a traffic jam at the exits.We decided to stay in the park and do a long hike vs leaving with everyone else who went back to their hotels for breakfast or whatever.  It was nice, we saw only a few people at that hour.  We then did the one-way loop around the park, making some stops here and there, in relatively peaceful (not a lot of people) manner.High tide was around 2PM, so we decided to go get an early lunch and come back around noon to see the phenomena at Thunder Hole.  This is when everything went South.  Traffic was the most insane I think I have seen at a park (again, on a TUESDAY).  We were stuck in traffic before the entrance for at least an hour, and once you hit the one-way road into the park, you're stuck in it.  I'm talking people with road rage, broken down buses stuck in the road, and another bus that sideswiped a car.  No parking whatsoever once you get in, and the people are just everywhere.  Amazing difference between visiting early in the morning and then in early afternoon."
Beautiful!,"Canoe or kayak Long pond.  Visit Cadillac Mountain.  Explore, explore and explore.  Rent a bike for the Carriage trails!"
Amazing destination ,"Naturally beautiful! Carriage roads are awesome. Hikes are beautiful and very accessible via Island Explorer. For a family with kids aged 10/12, hikes and trails were perfect. Very good “bang for the buck” as far as effort/views goes. Recommend Bubble Mountain and Sargent/Gilmore. Avoid Jordan Pond and Cadillac where the crowds congregate."
Acadia National Park,"This is an outstanding National Park.  There are so many trails to walk and it is a great way to experience the coastal landscape. You can drive your vehicle or choose the park’s transportation.  One can pull off all along loop road to enjoy nature and picturesque landscape.  Children have a lot of fun on the rocks.  Plus it just makes you feel very healthy with the fresh air.  We brought our children here over 25 years ago and are back with our grandchildren experiencing the park all over again.  Just a great place,"
A bit too crowded for me,We found the park to have some breathtaking scenery but having said that I wasn’t overwhelmed as I thought I’d be.Probably had to do with the hordes of people everywhere we looked.Glad we had the park pass and didn’t have to pay.
Great Park with beautiful views,"We drive around the park, and stopped at various places to look at the scenery and take photos. Even though it was tourist season, there were not too many people, and we were able to find parking. At times, you need to park on the side of the road to see a particular view. A park pass is required. We particularly liked the view from Cadillac Mt. The nature center and garden were small, but nicely kept. There was also a small indian museum (Abbe) with a larger one in town, but due to time constraints, we did not visit. Note, there was a storm coming, and the summit as quite windy."
Awesome,"We visited early June. Was was cool, but great for hiking. Crowds were minimal as was the traffic. Majority of the activities were open."
Beautiful Park!,"This park was breathtaking. We visited here for a few hours by bus via our cruise ship tour, and boy did it deliver! Our only complaint is that we did not get to explore even more of the park. We did have the opportunity to get off at a few spots along the loop in order to take some photos of the scenery, and to explore a bit. Our children ages 9 and 11 enjoyed this park as much as my husband and I did. We can't wait to cruise the New England itinerary again, so that we can spend more time exploring this gem of a park!"
Oh so pretry,Such a beautiful national park. We went after 4 o’clock driving the loop and we didn’t have to deal with too many people. We were able to park in the main parking at every pull off. If going at peak times highly recommend taking the bus from downtown Bar Harbor
So much to see,"We really enjoyed the time we spent in the park! We were worried about how crowded the park would be so we didn't go on the weekend! That helped, we got the $30 car pass and had only to wait a little while to find parking. It wasn't as bad as it could've been. So many different trails for hiking at every level. The map the park gives you doesn't explain the trails, it just shows you where they are. I researched the trails on TripAdvisor before so we knew what to expect! Pack lots of water and take your time to enjoy the views because there are many! I would love to go back!"
Beautiful,"Beautiful area in bar harbor. Lovely scenery when touring around the loop road.  Very busy throughout the park. We were on a tour and got parked in designated areas but i can imagine if self driving parking could be difficult. A few toilets, shops and various stopping points along the way. If you have the time it is worth a visit."
Catching the sunrise in winter,"I’ve done hikes in Acadia in past years, like the South Ridge Trail (a pretty long, but not too demanding hike) and always had a great time exploring New England’s only national park. But I want to share one logistical fact that I learned this past March, when I woke up early, planning to catch the sunrise from the top of Mt Cadillac. The road that leads to the top, Cadillac Summit Road, is closed from December to April 14th — I didn’t know this until I had already driven two hours and got to the blocked-off entrance to the road. Probably should have checked the NPS website before I left, but I’m just sharing it here so you don’t have to! If you want to be the “first to see the sunrise” and it’s wintertime, your best bet is to watch it from the docks off Agamount Park in Bar Harbor."
Amazing landscape,Just follow the Park Loop road and discover beautiful places along. it's really worth paying the entry fee
Fan-f-tastic!,"Sand Beach, Otter Cliffs, Jordan Pond, Echo Lake, Cadillac Mountain.Simply fantastic. It's definitely an early-morning type place.  People get there early, and parking is a bit limited.We went to Sand Beach at 10AM and it felt too late.  Parking was slightly tough that day, though Sand Beach was the most crowded of all the spots.The only obnoxious people around were the New Yorkers (who don't wake up early)."
Excellent Nation Park,"We hiked Cadillac Mountain, spent some time on Sand Beach and really enjoyed a Carriage Ride - very family friendly all the way around.  Can't recommend enough the carriage rides!"
"Crowded in Summer, But Lots of Nice Spots!","Jordan Pond and Cadillac Mountain are the most popular spots, but there a lots of other places that are less crowded during the peak summer tourist months. And even Jordan Pond isn't too bad earlier and later in the day then. The Schoodic Peninsula is less crowded and beautiful in its own right."
Amazing sunrise spots,"The park is known for being one of the first places in the country the sun rises. The sunrise is awesome from a number of areas. Cadillac Mountain is the most popular, but Otter Cliff is a less popular and a fabulous place to see the sunrise. Get there 40 minutes before the sunrise time to fully experience it!"
Stars Over Sand Beach,"Of course Acadia is amazing, so no need to discuss that. Highly recommend that visitors go to “Stars Over Sand Beach” program! Our program staff Kirk and Kim were kind, friendly, funny, qualified, and engaging. They told us all about the stars above and gave us a lot of insight into their histories. It was a unique way to spend the night that fits the scene perfectly. Even with clouds overhead, it was amazing!!! What a great idea and two amazing rangers."
Bad trail markings could get people hurt!!!!!!!,The signs at the Jordan Cliffs trail say the trail is open on weekends but closed during the week for trail maintenance We hiked on a saturday which means the trail should be O-P-E-N! 2.5 miles in the trail comes to a set of pink tape and signs that say DO NO TOUCHwe could have gone around somehow but i had a 15 year old with me and trying to be a good parent means NOT doiong anythig that would be wrong! You d-bags need to get your act together or I'll back more funding for parades rather than your lackluster attention to your jobsFirst Arches in MOAB UT with its non existent trail markers and now this abrupt end and blockage of a trail that signs clearly state is openyou'll have to get a real job if the NPS loses funding - then what would you do?
beautiful ocean views from everywhere,"Such a beautiful park.  Once above the treeline you're surrounded by ocean views on all sides!  we absolutely love hiking here.  best enjoyed in the spring and fall, as the island is inundated with tourists between memorial day and labor day."
Don't miss it,Some of the nicest views in Maine.  Gorgeous coastline and quiet bicycle paths. The town of Bar Harbor even provides free shuttle bus routes to get you out there and then other routes in the park .  Keeps the traffic down.
A more rugged national park,"This national park has a different feel than others we've visited, a bit more rustic, no big lodge/huge visitor's center, signage is different, and it is located between and around residential areas.      We enjoyed the hikes though.  Especially Ocean Trail.  Recommend going up Cadillac Mtn when you get the chance--sometimes closed due to too much traffic around sunset.  Hard to make it at sunrise since it is so early here."
One of the best places on the planet,"I have been to some of the most beautiful places on the earth, and this ranks up there. We named our daughter Acadia, that says it all.  For anyone who appreciates the ability to walk out your door and bike, hike and kayak all in one day, this is the place."
It was a nice trip,We enjoyed the tour through the park I’m not sure it was one of my favorite parks I’ve ever been to but it was nice and if you’re in that area I would recommend seeing it
Crowds ruined our visit.,"We were warned about the crowds in Acadia in July. Like many people, this was the only time of year we could visit. We were camping in Schoodic Woods (excellent) and took a ferry from Winter Harbor to Bar Harbor to avoid traffic coming into Bar Harbor and Acadia (ferry ride was the best part of our day). After locating the free Shuttle Explorer Bus (these buses are not in the same location as the other tour buses that are close to the ferry docks) we rode into the park alongside heavy private auto traffic. We got off the buses at several stops in the park only to be swarmed by people. We could not shoot photos without numerous other people in them. Cars were parked along many of the park roads and people were walking significant distances to get to overlooks. We had a picnic with a view of Jordan Pond-forget about the nearby restaurant-too crowded. We caught a bus and took ""the long way"" back to Bar Harbor so we could say we saw most of the park, at least in a very superficial way. The Shuttle Explorer buses do their part to reduce traffic congestion, but do not go to Cadillac Mtn. The drivers are nice and incredibly patient. I understand visiting the park in the next few years will be a completely different experience and hopefully a more positive one as there are plans to limit the number of people visiting at any given time. I will not be visiting again unless the experience is improved significantly."
Amazing sights and trail system,"Amazing family time spent in the park. Great cycling trails, lakes and amazing views around Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond. My 7 year old had his own bike and the climbs weren’t too bad in that area for him. Sand Beach is also a much in the park if you want some beach days. Spent lots of time in the waves with the kids. So much more to say about the park, but experience it for yourself!We will be back many times in the future."
Great day at Acadia Park,4 couples had a great day with Paul of At Your Service Tours. We saw virtually all key attractions and Paul couldn't have been better. We would recommend both At Your Service Tours and Paul to anyone wanting to see it all in 5 hours.
Beautiful but Not for handicapped,"This is a beautiful huge park with mountains, forest, and ocean views. I am handicapped and we did not find it particularly handicapped friendly. I was able to get to the top of Cadillac Mountain thanks to the handicapped accessible trail from the parking lot. This area is very crowded. We didn’t find much else that was easy to negotiate, even the rest areas and gift shops. We found that our best option was to see the coastline and some outer islands via a boat cruise."
Gorgeous National Park,"Acadia was new for our family, who often vacation out west.  It’s just gorgeous, and the hiking is amazing. And while August is clearly the busiest month, it wasn’t as crowded as I feared.  Parking lots fill quickly, but the Island Explorer buses get you around the park efficiently so you don’t need your car. We will be back!"
Fabulous landscape,"One of the key highlights of our trip in New England. We spent a little bit of time considering whether to pay the $240+ for an escorted tour rather than driving ourselves, having been a little bit concerned about whether the quality of roads might be poor going up to Cadillac Mountain.  We were so relieved that we had chosen to drive ourselves. The roads were exceptionally good with many one-way sections meaning that we did not have to worry about vehicles travelling in the other direction. Indeed the roads are wide and entirely safe and driving ourselves meant that we could keep stopping every time we saw a beautiful landscape, of which there were many. The circular route (Park Loop Road) was perfect for showing a range of aspects of the park and there were also regular parking areas for us to pull into. The cost to enter the park is very reasonable ($30/car) and due to the fact it’s enables multiple entries we returned for the evening to see the sunset at the top of the mountain and again for the morning to see the sunrise,  resulting in some phenomenal photographs. Apart from the phenomenal landscapes the beach was also lovely as was Thunder Hole. We spent a full day there and my two teenagers loved it every bit as much as my husband and I. If we had another day we would have gone back, though a day was sufficient to hit the main highlights. Of our 15 days in New England, this for me was the main highlight."
Worth seeing,Worth seeing - you can take the free Islander Tour buses on routes throughout the park - find them on the Village Green in Bar Harbor.
You Have To See It To Believe It...Gorgeous Vistas overlooking Bar Harbor & Frenchman's Bay,"[8/12] Have returned to Acadia National Park with Family about 5-6 times over these past 15 years...it's beauty is something you can never get enough of...even the best photos can't replace experiencing it for yourself...truly incredible.     My family used to live in nearby Winter Harbor, Maine (the OTHER, lesser-known Acadia National Park...go especially during the Winter Harbor Lobster Festival) back in the early 70's, and have made a point to return...for outdoor fun, for pictures, for memories, dining...just a chance to share this again with family & friends...a pure natural treat! :-D     Do the whole park...the Visitor's Center, Jordon Pond House (superb popovers), the incredibly scenic old Carriage Roads ('Thanks' Rockefeller family for helping to create this!), Thunder Hole, the beaches...Bar Harbor...its all good.       You can fly into the nearby airport & rent a car, L.L. Bean offers a FREE Island Explorer bus service, the village green in Bar Harbor is a spectacular place to rest and get a coffee & pastry while you do a little sightseeing and shopping.  There are aerial tours as well as water tours...and even a ferry between Acadia NP in Bar Harbor & Acadia NP in Winter Harbor.  Plenty of restaurants, wonderful hotels & beautiful B&B's...and hey, you're in Maine...have a Lobster with Blueberry pie for dessert!     Don't miss out on opportunities to pull over on the loop road up to/down from the summit of Cadillac Mtn. on Mt. Desert Island, to pick some wild blueberries.  Hike around if you can (I'm in a wheelchair, so cannot...but there is a concrete path to the summit of the Mtn., and nearby wheelchair accessible parkin & and accessible bathroom at the gift shop at the top of the mountain, where you can also get snacks and post cards/souvenirs...take home some Maine maple syrup or blueberry jam).     Don't miss this lifetime opportunity to see such natural beauty...make and take the time to complete this bucket list item...and really...don't be in a hurry...take the time to leisurely explore and enjoy, take it all in...cherish what you are seeing...pictures can remind, but not do justice...see it for yourself.  Enjoy with Family & Friends.  GO!"
Be prepared to adjust your plans,"This is our third trip back to Acadia and the amount of people visiting the park has grown tremendously.   I would highly recommend parking at the visitor center and using the Island Explorer buses to navigate your way around.   Parking is at a premium at many of the spots.  You may find that some locations that you want to visit are quite packed and if you have the time, you may want to make an adjustment  and head to a different part of the park.The views are tremendous and Cadillac Mountain is worth doing at least once."
Ahhhhhcadia! ,"So beautiful. I hadn’t been since childhood. Better than I remembered! We spent 3 days in Acadia. We stayed at Atlantic Eyrie( separate review), taking the shuttle into Bar Harbor. You pick up your weeklong park pass on the green at the Ranger Station. You can get the schedule of Ranger talks , and check and see any trail closures or warning. ( none for us). We picked up the Acadia shuttle also on the green and clearly marked. Just show your park pass. No additional charge. The shuttle takes a full loop around the park- stopping at trails and recreation areas along the way. We hopped off the first day at Sand Beach. Some families were hanging here for the day! Gorgeous and clean. We hiked to Otter point. About 2 miles. For great views stop and climb out on the rock promontories ! We explored this area for well over 2 hours. ( climbing shoes a must). The main path is easy. Depends how much exploring you want to do! There was a gift shop with snacks at Otter point ( and restrooms). This is where we had our first taste of a local soda called Old Soaker! Root Beer is good - Blueberry is outstanding! This is a must taste thing! We continued exploring via the shuttle popping on and off. Our second day we took the car driving out to seal beach and exploring less developed areas. Lots of fun nooks and crannies to explore. Pull off , park and hike! Definitely need bug spray here! That evening we drove to Cadillac mountain- about 5pm. Too early for sunset but all the morning fog was gone - and the views were breathtaking. We hiked about chatting with others who had come to wait for the sunset ( about 8:15pm). Many of these folks had gotten up early to see the sunrise here( about 5am).  Our 3rd day in Acadia we had reservations ( a must) to Kayak on long lake. A morning explore on a clear day. Loons, eagles, ducks - bring your camera. The kayak excursion is for 3 hours. Plenty of time to explore. They also rent canoes and paddle boards. The afternoon was spent a Jordan pond. This hike is partially on boardwalks which were under construction. There is a restaurant here but we had reservations elsewhere. Wait time when we arrived was 1 hr. Bring water bottles and hiking shoes. There are bikes available to rent. We hiked. Lots to do in  Acadia. We will be back"
Beautiful,"To tell you the truth I didn't want to go north on our Royal Caribbean Cruise. But I am so glad we did. Bar Harbor is beautiful and Acadia National Park is breathtaking.  We enjoyed our bus ride to the park and visited various sites.  My favorite was Thunder Hole. When the tide comes in it sounds like thunder, even though we didn't hear the full the effect it was was still awesome.  A definite to do in Maine."
Hiking From Otter Point To Sand Beach And Beyond.,"Bar Harbor is a tender port. Best to leave the cruise ship early because there are lots to do and see here. We arrived at the tender dock around 9 AM. We walked up to the adjacent Agamont Park and asked the tourist officials there how we could hike the trails in Acadia National Park. They directed us up Main Street to the National Park services building. I told the ranger that we wanted to use the Island Explorer bus to go to Otter Cove and walk back to town. The ranger asked if we were ready for a 10-mile hike. No. She took out a map and circled Otter Cove and Sand Beach saying this is the most scenic hike and is a little more than 3-miles. Then she said the free Island Explorer bus loads passengers at Village Green, a little further up Main Street. There is a clock on Main and a gazebo in the park. The bus loads at the western side of the park in front of the fire and police stations. We loaded up and off we went into the beautiful park winding up hills and through dense forests. We passed many stops like Sand Beach, Blow Hole and finally arrived at Otter Cove, got out and entered the hiking trail. I would rate the hike as a moderate activity level two experience. It is not that smooth and would be tough for the ambulatory challenged. The scenery is breathtaking. Around a turn one can see Sand Beach far into the distance. Naturally the more you hike the closer you come. People started arriving in droves around noon and about 1 PM we had arrived at Sand Beach. There is an unobstructed view of Cadillac Mountain from the eastern end of the beach. After checking it out for a while, we boarded the Island Explorer and rode it back into town. I asked the driver where we could get a cheap beer and he said The Dog and Pony Tavern behind the fire station. We enjoyed a beer and a snack for a reasonable price and headed for the Shore Path, a 1/2 mile waterfront trail back to the dock. We were shopping for souvenirs at Oli's Trolley when the cashier asked if we were going on their trolley ride around town. Why not. We took the tour which was informative and entertaining then walked back to The Dog and Pony Tavern for a happy hour beer, now only $2. As it was getting close to time for the cruise ship to leave, we took the tender back and sat on the balcony overlooking the stunning beauty of this remarkable port. It turned out to be our favorite in our 14-day journey."
Acadia - A National Treasure,"WOW, what a great place to visit and see nature at its finest.  We had a rainy day for the 1st day of our visit so we took a trolley tour of the park (Oli’s Trolley - leaving from the waterfront in Bar Harbor).  It is a great way to get a 2 1/2 hour tour and overview of the park, with 3 stops of 15 minutes to allow some additional exploring.  This was a great overview for us to then be able to decide where we wanted to venture out on our own over the next few days. There are many points that should not be missed (Sand Beach, Jordon Pond, Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole).  I found that a nice ~ 2 mile walk (each way) starting at Sand Beach to Thunder Hole was very enjoyable, great scenic spots to get down to the cliffs and rocky outcrops, a mild stroll along the loop road.  The difficult of the trails offers something for everyone.  Enjoy!"
A Hiker's Dream,"One of the best hiking spots in New England. Trails for all ages and skill levels. Views are spectacular from every summit. Book early, since Bar Harbor fills up fast. Need to get to trailhead parking by 8:30 am since spaces are very limited."
"So much to do, even a week is not enough.","Where else can you hike bald mountain peaks and look out over the Atlantic Ocean.  With over 100 trails, I could spend all summer here hiking, but there is so much else to do as well,"
Great National Park!  So diverse! Lots of great on the short side hikes! Beautiful views,Great National Park!  So many differently types of trails from easy to mountain climbing.  Views are amazing. Rangers are friendly and helpful!  A must if you are in the area! Parking is at a premium so get there early!
Bucket list item checked,"What an amazing place!  It was on our bucket list for years.We are not hikers (wife's knee replacement surgery earlier this year) but we still had a blast.  We stayed four nights in a local campground (Hadley's Point) and never ran out of things to see or do, even without doing a backcountry hiking trip.  Be sure to stop at the overlooks and take in the beautiful sights."
Fantastic Park,We drove the loop around the park and stopped at most of the overlooks. This was our first visit to the New England area so it was fascinating to see the coastline in comparison to the beaches in the southeast.  The views are worth the drive.
great views and hiking,this is a do not miss place on Mount Desert island the drive to the top of Cadilac mountain is easy and beautiful
Park passes are too Expensive!!,Decided to have a picnic at Thompsons Island for my grand daughters first birthday. I grew up here in Maine and have never had to pay to go to Thompsons Island.I Noticed it requires a park pass now so I head to the Visitor center to purchase one. I had gone online and noticed it said one pass covers 15 people. But that's only if your in one car! Ended up buying 2 for 60 dollars!! Only 8 people are going to be there but had to buy 2! They don't offer A day pass or even a discount for locals! Not even going to use the Pass after today! Thompsons Island isn't even in the park! Greedy people!! For the amount of money they are stealing from people I hope the park is 100% maintaned!
Put this on your bucket list,"What a wild and beautiful part of the country.  Well worth the travel time to experience this raw beauty.  Come during blueberry season and pick your own blueberries.  There is something here for everyone.  Mountain climbing, coastline and beautiful trails."
Favorite place on my trip,The park is filled with stunning views & different areas to explore. Thunder Hole was my favorite spot but the cliffs overlooking the water were amazing! This is a must see when visiting the area!!
Amazing trip!,"This park is an amazing place to visit. There is so much to do after 1 week we feel like we barely scratched the surface. The hiking trails were so well maintained and something for every level. We biked the carriage trails also very well maintained and was a highlight for me. We did also did a fishing tour and came home with fish for dinner. We stayed near Otter and Seal cove, no crowds felt like had the place to ourselves. If you go to bar harbor etc... there will be more crowds and feel touristy so we avoided but that is personal preference. Highly recommend!"
Awesome views!,Really worth it! And big enough for you to find your spot. Really really worth going. With or without kids. We took a little lunch in a bag and had a pícnic on the rocks.... make sufre to dispose  of your trash... the place is spotless.
Frustrating to visit on a summer Friday,"The park is beautiful and we were really looking forward to what we had planned. Unfortunately the only thing that went as we hoped was our drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain, which thankfully we did first. After that, every parking area was jammed full of cars. They allow parking on the road in some places but that gets kind of ridiculous. We just got frustrated and though we loved what we saw on the Loop road, we drove past some other areas (like Jordan House) because there simply wasn't anywhere to park. Frustrating!"
Fantastic venue and National Parl,"The best shore experience you will find.  From Shoreline drives, the hiking trails, The Bubbles, Mt Cadillac, Southwest Harbor and the Carriage Roads.  You will find something for everyone.  When we got our park pass the Ranger nicely asked if any of us were 62 ""since you don't look the part"".  We were and she recommended an annual pass for $20 vice the individual $15 each.  What a nice touch that started the day with Jordan Pond to boot."
Over-hyped tourist trap.,"I do agree with other reviewers that this is a wonderful place to showcase natural beauty, but huge crowds, no, hordes of destructive humans turning it into a NYC 8-th ave on a crowded day. Do yourself a service and go to a local state park, you might find some peace and same natural beauty there without thousands of people and car traffic worse than LA. As well as by not going you might help preserving this nature wonder for some generations."
Absolutely Stunning,"We visited in whim after heading to Lobster Fest in Rockland, and were ever so surprised at how breathtakingly beautiful this National Park is. Easily accessible, beautifully maintained. Definitely would return again!"
Great land!,"A wonderful land to showcase nature, beauty and peace.  Not crowded.  There are blue oceans, clean and jagged shorelines, lakes,  trees, flowers, and granite mountains.  Many activities, hiking, biking, horse riding, and carriage tour."
Wonderful,We drove through the main Park loop which had many pull over spots for filming or seeing the breathtaking views. The loop was a great way to do this without a major hike. The next day we drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain. It was gorgeous and well worth doing!
First Visit to the Park,I can't get over the breath taking views.  We got up at 3:30 one morning to watch the sunrise on Cadillac mountain.  The walk on the oceanside trail was beautiful and a very easy stroll.  we hiked to the top of Gorham Mountain trail with the family.  ages 3 to 67.  It was a little difficult but with lots of rest stops it was well worth it.  On the way down some of us took the Cadillac Cliff trail.   Steep but alot shorter.  Bike riding on the carriage roads was beautiful.  Just bring lots of bug spray.  Trails were well maintained.  Us older folks had to walk a couple of the hills but mostly had no problems.  We did 3 days in the park.  Could have done a few more.  Guess we will save those for next trip.
Beautiful!,We did the Jordan Pond hike and it was gorgeous! We arrived early so we beat most of the crowd on the hike. It was not a difficult loop however if you are traveling with a dog or a small child just be aware that parts of the trail are up on a wooden path and there are a couple of tricky spots on the rocky part of the trail. It took us a couple of hours to do the full loop but it was not strenuous.
"A national treasure, truly",This is our 10th time up here and we always leave happy. There's plenty to do and much to see. I will say that this year has been the busiest by far. They now have a large cruise ship that comes up form NY and adds a whole lot of people.
Beautiful,This is a beautiful part of the country and very easy to get around.  The hikes are family friendly and there are many not too difficult.
Absolutely stunning!,"Our family of 4 had a great 3 days at Acadia.  Just when you think you couldn’t possibly see another beautiful view, you did!  We loved cadillac Mountain and playing in the rocks on the beach!  Sand Beach was pretty but water was way too cold for this southern family!"
Great tour on school bus tour,"The tour to Acadia mountain was fabulous. Roger, a life long Bah Hah Bah native was justbfabulous. Gus love for the Acadia Nationsl Park was just contagious. I will do this again when I return."
Beautiful park,We took a bus tour that was great and stopped at 3 places. Then we went back in our own car for additional stops. Also ate at Jordan Pond.
Very impressive,"It's a beautiful park. You can hike to the top of Cadillac Mountain, drive (limited parking) or go with a tour. You should know that buses can only park for 20 minutes at the top, though. You can see for miles and miles if you happen to arrive on a clear day."
"Beautiful park, lots and lots of trails",This park has trails of all levels of difficulty. Some of the moderate ones are really pretty hard in some places. Climbing rocks. The Jordan Pond is a beautiful trail and very well maintained and fairly easy on the east side. Some areas can be very crowded. I recommend going to the more popular spots early in the morning or in the evening after the cruise ships leave. Beautiful lakes inland as well as shoreline to see and enjoy.
Amazing trip,"Visited Acadia National Park with a young child and two teens and had a spectacular day! We traveled up Cadillac Mountain and viewed the most incredible panoramic views of the ocean and islands. Visited Sand beach which was beautiful, however waters are way to cold to swim. Went to Jordan Pond and had a great lunch with fantastic view of the “pond”. Recommend the popovers! Visited thunder hole which was very cool as you could watch the waves crash into a hole and make a thundering sound effect! The park is picturesque! We will be back!! Schoodic point off of Route 1 is also amazing!!! We LOVE Maine!"
Cadillac mountain is a decent climb but very worth it!,The view from the top of Cadillac Mtn is amazing. It's worth the hike but takes about 2 hours. You can drive if you like but its a bit busy. The top does have dog friendly fountains and a cute little gift shop. 10/10 would go again.
"Acessible and beautiful, a gem in the National Parks Crown","The US National Parks are one of the undoubted success stories of this Nation and despite frequent assaults on its budget and status it continues to protect and preserve some of the country's most important and beautiful natural wonders.Acadia National Park is one such and is accessible to most people with lots to do for all ages and abilities. The park is not one piece of land but a sort of jigsaw puzzle wrapped around private land, towns and villages. One area, Schoodic Point, is an hours drive from the main site set on Desert Island. There are good roads throughout the park and beautiful vista points overlooking lakes and Atlantic coastline with innumerable little islands. There are walks and trails for all abilities including some serious climbing challenges.One of the most intriguing parts of the park are the carriage roads which are literally horse and carriage trails, although cyclists are welcome there are no cars. Private individuals can bring their horses into the park and use this 27-mile network of roads but visitors can really only access them on a carriage ride. These are either one or two hours long and well worth the expense. The majority of the roads were built by John D Rockerfeller Jr providing employment for skilled and unskilled labour. The roads and their bridges are fantastically well made, we were told they require little or no maintenance, and are beautiful to look at as is the scenery they pass through.There are several gift shops around notably at the main visitor centre, Jordan Pond House, with a good restaurant, Cadillac Mountain and more. A real treat for the eye and the soul Acadia NP is truly a gem in the National Parks crown."
Acadia Birding Festival-A great way to kick off your summer,"This well-organized 4 day annual festival is based in Mt. Desert Island, ME and offers birdwatching tours in and outside of Acadia National Park. A visit to their website acadiabirdingfestival.com will get you started. Many interesting trips offered  with top-notch guides who will help you identify birds and answer your questions. Very nice evening programs are offered as well, featuring talks by prominent naturalists. Meet and greet lunches and dinners are also on the program. A favorite was a trip to Thurston's Lobster Pound. A fine time and reasonably priced, the festival organizers provide listing of very reasonable accomodations in the area, hotels, motels and cabins.  Hang out with some nice people in some breathtakingly beautiful areas you probably would not discover on your own. Beginners are welcome and embraced! Trips descriptions include level of physical activity required, helpful for those with special needs or children in tow. I would not recommend this for kids under 10."
Beautiful Park,"You can spend all day here.  Totally recommend Oli's Trolley first to take in all the sights and views, then hop in your car and go to your favorite spots.  There are hundreds of miles of trails and sights to see.  But do get those recommendations from Oli's first and you will be glad you did."
OK for East Coast,"The park is pretty crowded.  You couldn't park with 1/2 mile of Sand Beach (unless you were lucky or got there early). Schoodick was a nice area.  The thunder hole was a bust (much better on Oahu). Better looking beaches in California (Big Sur, Point Reyes for example). But this park had a nice selection of scenery in a small area and is on East Coast."
amazing !!!!,I recommend this to everyone who is into everything outdoors.such a beautiful place with breath taking views.  Loved every part of this park.
Beautiful Park!,"Acadia Natural Park has so much to offer for everyone, not only the natural beauty and different landscapes but many activities for all. The Beehive Trail is fun but not easy for everyone, so be mindful if you are not in good shape, totally worth it. Having lunch at Jordan Pond House is a must ( separate review)"
Nice hikes and views,"Great hikes and views of the coast. Not as much wildlife as seen in other national parks. Clean,  campground was nice and quiet. Loop trail was a nice drive."
One of the best National Park,"My wife and I visited the park 5 years ago while vacationing along the Maine coast line and this time it is a cruise stop. Beautiful as ever! However, we did notice it is getting crowded."
Such a beautiful park,"Our cruise ship was in Bar Harbor for one day.  We booked a private tour for my family of 6 with Rich Macdonald from the Natural History Center. He met us at the port with his minivan and helped my dad who sometimes needs a wheelchair.  Rich was so knowledgeable about the park, the history of the region and natural habitats that we had a most informative educational and fun day.  He stopped at many interesting spots and we went at our own pace.  The views from Cadillac Mountain were exceptional.  Thunder Hole was quiet - tide was low and the sea was calm.  We didn't see any seals either but we did catch some young falcons learning to fly - Rich had a spotting scope in the back of the van and set it up for us.  The Park was well-kept and not terribly crowded considering it was July 7th."
Stunning! Just stunning!,"My wife and I took our first trip to Acadia National Park last week. Such an amazing place!!! Such unspoiled natural beauty. The rugged coast. The tranquil clear lakes. So well-maintained. The crowds were not bad when we were there. Truly a wonder, a national treasure! We'll be back!!!"
Beautifully maintained,"Did a bike tour of Acadia National Park while on a cruise.  Very well maintained and beautiful.  Clean restrooms, nice parking areas and lookouts.  Well done!"
Great vacation getaway,We have been here several times in recent years and plan to come back for the fall leaf season. A great place to see nature’s beauty.
Just beautiful!,"The views are breath taking. We drove uo to Cadillac Mountain first, then we drove to the Sieur de Monts Ranger Center and Ranger Phil got us a Junior Ranger workbook. We complete the tasks and then Ranger Phil swore in my kids are official junior rangers. He even added a bit about ""listen to your mother and eat your vegetables"". My kids are 6, active, adventurous and very curious and all I can say is be careful and stay on the path with your little ones. We had a lot of scraped knees and other road rash from going off the path and not being careful. Bring bandaids and neosporin. Thank goodness we left with as many kids as we went with. We drove the loop road, which had many stopping points where we got out an explored. We drove our own truck and found the traffic and parking to be ok, not abundant, but ok."
LOVE This Place!,"Acadia Park is absolutely beautiful no matter when you visit.  We've been in the spring, summer and fall.  All seasons were spectacular."
Nice park,"Acadia National Park is very big with lots of hiking trails.  Easy and beautiful hiking trails are Jordan Pond (within Park Loop road) and Ship Harbor and Wonderland are in Southwest island.  The best time to visit the park are between 1 - 3 pm esp if you want to check out The Cadillac Mountain.  Without hiking, you can easy check out the park in a day.  We reserved 3 nights in this area which we thought too many, 2 days would be good including stopping by Bar Harbor village.  Use the Island Explorer buses which are free and run around from the neighbor cities and into the park and village.  Very convenient and free.  Check it out."
Cadillac of Parks,"Well, at least there is Cadillac Mountain.  This park is a bit unique, although entrance gates there are private residences across Desert Island so it is easy to get in/out/around the road systems.  We were told to visit Cadillac during sunrise and yes, it is worth the early morning arrival.  That also allowed us to get our day started before most of the crowds and we never had challenges finding parking and crushed a couple hikes before the lunch hour;  Beehive and Jordan Pond"
Fabulous park,This park was beautiful. It a an enormous park with great hiking and biking trails.  The carriage trails were awesome to bike.  The Park is popular and finding parking can sometimes be difficult.  We never lost an opportunity due to parking though.  With patience you can find a spot.  The sunrise on Cadillac mountain is a must.  Just beautiful.  There are many different areas to explore in the park so always have a plan B to go to in the park if your plan A is too full or busy.  Go to plan A another time or day.  That worked great for us.  Lots of great swimming holes and beaches along the hiking trails.  Obtain a map and use the park guides.  They are a great resource.
Beautiful National Park,"We stopped here on our private tour with MDI Tours. Our guide,Will was wonderful. He allowed us to stop at many of the beautiful areas in the park. We would love to come back to the area and visit for a longer time. We were on an excursion for the day from our ship. We got a great overview but would definitely like to spend many days there."
Purchase Park Pass on Village Green in Bar Harbor first,"Walk over to the Village Green in Bar Harbor and get your pass before you head to the park, then you can drive right in. Skip Sand Beach, its just a beach, there is a lovely pull off right past it that you can look back and see it. You really need to hit the park by 8am. Jordon Pond is a nightmare, people park there for days on end so the spots DO NOT turn over. It's just a really crowded park. Be patient, enjoy all that you can see."
Absolutely beautiful,"I've come here plenty of times but this most recent time in July was spectacular! There are plenty of sights by car on the main loop road including Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, beaches and more. If you're looking to avoid the traffic get there early (or bike!) There is room to bike the main road as it is two lanes and one way most of the 27-mile loop.If you're looking for something a little more challenging, check out the carriage roads for mountain biking or the hiking options on the ""quiet side"" of the island (yes it's literally called that!)."
Don't miss this wonderful USA asset,The natural beauty of the park is so inspiring. It draws you in to learn more and more of our nations beauty in our national parks. Love Love Love this place.
"Great park with combination of lakes, sea & Mountain View’s","We enjoyed 2 days at Acadia, one of which was somewhat spoiled by rain. I suggest packing ponchos & wearing trail shoes. We were fortunate to enjoy trails almost to ourselves, despite it being high season. The top of Cadillac Mountain is magnificent on clear days. Jordan Pond and Waterfall Trails are also great low impact hikes. The signage could be better in parts of the park, and it would be nice to have a few more designated picnic spots & bathrooms.For those with National Parks Passes, the Pass covers both park admission and serves as your car entry fee, usually $30/vehicle. Only one family member needs to have the pass to get the car into the park. Since bus “depots” are in the open, you don’t want to be waiting 30” in the rain for the next shuttle bus!"
Visit to Acadia,"Acadia was terrific, exceeded my expectations, just beautiful.  One suggestion is to go early in the morning to stay ahead of the crowds."
Breathtaking.,Days of hiking and exploring.  Great value.  Price of a car which includes 4 adult tickets $30 for the week.  Drove up Cadillac Mountain View’s priceless!
Indescribably beautiful,"Go.  Bring bikes.  Plan to hike.  Drive the loop road, and make sure you stop at Thunderhole and drive up to Cadillac Mountain for the spectacular views. Hang at Eagle Lake to kayak or picnic.  Walk the Jordan Pond loop trail and then stop for popovers and blueberry lemonade at the Jordan Pond House.  You will love every single second of the park.  It's a national treasure."
Gorgeous,"This park is so beautiful, the views are amazing. From the mountain tops to the beach, just breathtaking! Signs are posted and very helpful when driving from place to place."
Beautiful national park,"We hiked the Door Mountain trails, Cadillac Mountain trails, and the Great Head trail. It wasn't easy but we were sure glad we did it....the views were a super reward."
Beautiful views,"Each of our family members have a 'National Passport'.  It serves as a great planning tool to be sure we capture some of our national treasures during our vacation adventures.  Acadia National Park was a wonderful addition to our passport experience.  We enjoyed the park on 2 separate days, the first on a sunset tour through Oli's Trolley.  The second was a drive of our own to stop at the various locations.  Sand beach was beautiful, with the beach, ocean and awesome rock formations.  Jordan Pond and the freshwater was stunning, I could have stayed there for hours.  The water was so clear.  Thunder Hole was pretty cool, we stayed for only 10-12 minutes, but hearing a wave crash into the cave, making a thundering sound, was time well spent. If you are in Bar Harbor, Acadia Nation Park is an absolute must."
Sunday drive,Surprised by the ease of driving the loop on a Sunday afternoon.  Hiking trails were not crowded either.
Varied attractive park.,"This park is not overly large but has at least 4 distinct parts: the western peninsular, main (central) peninsular, the town of Bar Harbor (on the main peninsular) and the eastern peninsular.All are interesting and varied. Obviously lots of lovely coastline, even when it's misty, lighthouses, short or more strenuous hikes, quaint villages. Interesting natural phenomena, boats and Mount Cadillac.Bar Harbor is best approached using the shuttle bus from the visitors' centre (because of the parking problems). Lots of restaurants, snacky places, pubs, very good looking hotel (we didn't stay there).Allow 3 days for a cursory visit at a relaxed pace."
For the best experience get their early. Try to make use of the excellent free bus system,Many places to see. Trying to find a parking spot can ruin your day. If you don't arrive early in the day. Park in the visitor lot and take the excellent free bus. For the best experience walk from one attraction to a other and leave the crowd behind.
"Gorgeous state park, with fabulous views!","What a fantastic park! Beautiful 365 views from Cadillac Mt. And sand beach was a bonus. Tons of trails to hike, the mountains and the sea. Would love to being our kids back here."
Beautiful views!,"This is a beautiful national park that offers opportunities for hiking, biking or just enjoying the view."
Three Days in Acadia,"Here's my take on Acadia:The visitors center: My first stop is usually a stop at the visitors center to get a good overview of the park and watch the movies for perspective.  The visitors center at Arcadia has one desk to purchase passes and another for information and a small store.  Not as helpful as I hoped for.The Park: The park is broken into many pieces across the islands.  I found it difficult to find my way around. The roads are not marked well, the maps are limited, the loop is only one way for some of the way and the most confusing is that the loop road crosses some of the main roads but don't have access on or off the loop and you have to detour to be able to get on to the loop. To make it more difficult, internet access is spotty and my cell phone battery drained to make the phone gps useless.  I finally got the hang of it but suggest a good study of the roads before visiting.Crowds: Based on other reviews we were expecting huge crowds for mid July. There were crowds mid day in Bar Harbor but mostly because it's a small town and parking is limited. The parking in the park is very limited which makes it difficult in the middle of the day but I did not find the trails crowded. Just the parking lots small.Parking: We were out early and the parking lots along the coast were almost empty. We Parked down the loop road and hiked back toward Sand Beach and caught the shuttle back. By the time we got back to the parking lot a lot of cars were turned away with no spots available.    Loop Road along the coast: Beautiful vistas with jagged rock cliffs over the water. My best part of the park is the section between Sand Beach and Thunder Hole.  We stopped at Jordan Pond for a nice short walk along the lake.  We got to Cadillac Mountain one afternoon and had plenty of parking.  We went up for a 5am sunrise and had plenty of parking available at about 4:30am but the lot was pretty full by sunset. Shuttle: There are about 10 shuttle routes which is overwhelming until you figure it out.  The shuttle center in Bar Harbor looks like the main transfer area and the staff was very helpful.  We did have an afternoon fishing trip planned and the shuttle was more than 20 minutes late so be careful with their reliability. Camping: We camped at Blackwoods in a tent - Site A101. Our site was large, level and secluded enough from the other sites.  It looked like most of the other sites were large enough but without a lot of screening for the adjoining sites. To be fair, that is just a general observation. Bathrooms were clean and less maintained. Showers are offsite but close for $2 (bring quarters).  Ice and firewood are available at self serve stands along the road and just outside the campground.Lobster: We stopped at Pearson's to buy live lobster to grill at the campsite. Pearson's was great.Weather: was pleasant for the few days in mid July.Bugs: Based on the reviews we were concerned about flies and mosquitoes. Flies were not a problem at all and the mosquitoes were really not a big problem either and manageable with some OFF.Three days: Three days was good for us."
Packed a lot into a day - wide variety!,"We pack a lot into our vacations, so only had a day to spend at Acadia.  The kids (11, 13, 15) were not overly enthused when we told them we were doing another National Park.  However, they had a great time!We took the free bus from the visitor center - they run every half an hour, and if you plan well, you can get around with minimal waiting.  It is great not to have to worry about finding a parking spot, and you can really enjoy the view of the park.On the recommendation of a ranger (who said it looked scary, but was very safe, and easily do-able, even for our 11 year old), we did the Beehive trail.  It was really intimidating, but we were so glad we did it!  We were surprised that there were some kids as young as 5 (or so) doing this challenging trail!  If you plan to hike it, lighten the load on your backpack before hand!We went to Sand Beach, and we all enjoyed relaxing a bit, enjoying the ocean and the beautiful view.  Next we went to Jordan's Pond, which was another beautiful area.  After returning to the visitor center via bus, we took our car to Cadillac Mountain, where we enjoyed more panoramic views.The weather was perfect today, and the crowds were surprisingly light!It was a nice mix of activity, and can be as active or passive as you'd like it to be!  I highly recommend a visit, whether you can only go for a day, or have much longer to spend."
Wonderful National Park experience,"This park has a unique history since it was formed from donations of private land and not from government owned territory.   It has something for everyone:  a magnificent view from Cadillac Road, a beautiful road and path along the ocean, several scenic lakes, unusual former carriage roads, now available for biking and walking, some challenging hikes up very steep mountains (don't let the low elevation fool you), and charming seaside towns adjoining the Park.   There are the usual national park services such as naturalist activities.   Accommodations and food are not cheap in the area, but it is a wonderful experience."
A gem that requires polishing and appreciation.,"Acadia is perhaps the United States most groomed National Parks. The Rangers perform heroically in balancing accessibility with preservation. The trails are well-kept and in places manicured. This is in keeping with the Park's history as it was pretty much the personal preserve of the Rockefeller family. Expect crowds of most well-behaved visitors, stunning vistas, and some lovely hiking - there are hikes for all physical conditions and levels of commitments. Don't forget your common sense - or travel necessities - water, first aid kit, sunblock and bug spray and keep an eye open for bikes on the carriage trails."
Beautiful ,This park is wonderful. So many sights to see. Can get crowded with car parking. Recommend combination of one day bust to get a ‘tasting’ and one day car to linger where you want. Pristine!
Hike the Beehive Trail and the Ocean Side Trail to really enjoy this park.,"We are in our mid-sixties, in decent shape and we are dedicated. walkers and bike riders.  The Beehive is exhilarating and offers spectacular views of Acadia and Bar Harbor.  The Oceanside Trail allows almost continuous access to the great boulders that line the shoreline.  Acadia National is a great park."
A great place for the fit,Miles and miles of carriage rides to walk or bike.  Miles and miles of hiking trails to walk.   There are auto roads and tour buses available.    It’s a beautiful way to spend the day - even though I had to walk up a few of the hills.
Beautiful Park With Wonderful Scenary,"If visiting Bar Harbor you are definitely encouraged to take the time to visit Acadia Park.  Pay for park admission (it's good for a week) and drive the park.  You can plan some hikes but it's not required to enjoy the park.  I recommend taking time to visit Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and Jordan Pond and definitely stop to check out the view at the top of Cadillac Mountain.  Be aware that there is limited parking there so I recommend going earlier in the morning before the spots become difficult to acquire.  Or you can take a bus or trolley to get there."
Awe Inspiring,"We only had one full day to enjoy Acadia. We got into town the night before around 7:00 so decided to drive to Cadillac Mountain that evening. It was busy but not so busy that you couldn't drive up and find a parking spot. Going is definitely worth it! The panoramic views are gorgeous! The next day we drove to Hulls Visitor Center and took the Island Shuttle service.  When you get on make sure to get one of their maps with their hours. The driver should have one. Look at it carefully so you know when they stop and pick up at certain times and places but they will also pick you up wherever you are when you flag them down. Their services are very well worth using instead of trying to find parking spots as you go along! Since we only had one day, we took the Park Loop Drive.  Get out as often as possible and take the side trails down to the water. They are not long and not too hard. It is well worth it!"
Stunning and Thrilling!,"From ocean views to climbing iron rungs on the side of a cliff, this park has so much to see and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to experience the trails that had iron rungs and ladders -- thankfully the weather was nice when I went. Those hikes are not recommended when it's wet. I also loved that Acadia has a bus service that can take you to and from different areas of the park. That way, you don't have to worry about parking, especially in peak season. Use the bus system they have if you can! It really helps!"
Beautiful!,"Visited park on a motorcycle, beautiful!  Pictures do not do justice!  Beginning of park close to swimming beach is crowded but once you pass that area, the road opens up!"
Beautiful,Rode horse drawn wagon on carriage roads within the park.  Very beautiful scenery and wildlife.  Well preserved and not at all crowded.  Would love to return.
Outstanding and popular!,"We were here last over 30 years ago, and it did not disappoint. Definitely more crowded. We decided to drive ourselves rather than take a shuttle, which worked out fine. It gave us a chance to stop and take pictures as long as we wanted. Smart of us to bring a picnic lunch as we saw their restaurants were quite crowded and full. We happened to bring some folding chairs and sat for a while looking at the water. The busiest Visitor Information Center we ever saw anywhere. This is a place you really want to see - and be sure to bring a camera."
If the sea or hiking interist you this is your place,"A yearly vacation place for my family it should be on every ones bucket list. Hiking, history and the sea are what it is all about. It can get crowded during the peak seasons but is worth a visit any time of year. The town of Bar Harbor is near as are some smaller towns worth a visit. We discover something new each year"
Ocean Path Hike showcases Coastline,"Acadia National park is a very large area park on Mt. Desert Island.  It has a wealth of trails and carriage roads.  We hiked on the Ocean Path which took you around the coastline of the park on the eastern side.  There we saw rock formations, wildlife, and crashing waves."
breathtaking!!!,"Once you have been here, you will want to keep coming back. Stunning scenery and very well maintained. Bring the camera and enjoy!!!"
Spend all the time you can here.,"This is not to be missed.  It is a beautiful National Park with so many photo ops you almost want to walk from one to the other.  Sandy beach, mountain top, valley, marshland, forest, it has it all.  Take your time and drive the loop, walk the trails, and ride the horse drawn carriage. You can't go wrong.Only neg is the main gift shop.  Very small selection of items and you have to walk up many steps to get there.  Not worth the walk.  Later found out they have a handicapped entrance but it was so well hidden, no one knew about it."
Beautiful motorcycle ride,"Visited the park on motorcycle and it was a beautiful ride.  Would definitely recommend.  As a side note, we encourage travelers to get the National Park Pass and take advantage of what these parks have to offer!"
Beautiful place to visit and hike.,"Get out into nature and be prepared to hike some fun and challenging terrain.  Hike Jordan Pond around 10am, it will take 90 minutes to go around, enjoy the scenery then reward yourself with Popovers at the Jordan Pond House.  Delicious.   Hiked the Beehive trail, It is tough but doable.   Lots and Lots of boulders to climb over,   Bring good sturdy shoes, preferably hiking boots that you have broken in and are not new.  Bring plenty of water and you will be rewarded with a remarkable view up at the top.  So many hikes, pick the ones that are right for you."
"Interesting Park, Wish We Would Have Taken the Busses","We only drove the main loop, and didn't stop at several of the sites because travelling partner didn't want to ride the bus. The traffic wasn't too much of a headache, but the parking lots really were full and slow to navigate. I'd like to go back again and take the free busses and really spend more time getting to know this park."
Beautiful hike.  Amazing views,"If you only have a day or so to visit the park, visit Cadillac mountain at sunset (go to Bluehill mountain for best views) and also hike the loop around Jordan pond.  Must do lunch or brunch at Jordan pond restaurant for popovers and coffee--served with Maine blueberry jam and butter--superb!  nice gift shop on site."
Excellent All The Way!,"I can't imagine who would give Acadia National Park anything but a 5 star rating! So much to do, especially if you are in hiking. Even if you stick to the main attractions you get to see so much. So many beautiful views. Definitely go to the top of Cadillac Mountain and check out the Thunder Hole area. This park is popular for a reason! Even during peak season it is well worth a visit despite the greater traffic and crowds!"
Beautiful National Park!!,A must see or at least drive trough if you have a couple hours. Cadillac mountain has amazing views at sunrise and sunset. The time we went in early June was not to bad either for crowds.
Amazing Park!,This is now my favorite park.  Free shuttles in to park from Downtown Bar Harbor.  Free shuttles around the park.  Great trails and the Carriage Roads are great to bike or walk on.  Going to make this an annual visit.
Terrific Well-Organized Park,We did the 20+ mile drive in our rental car and it was terrific. Some of the areas to see may be full in the parking lot but the park encourages parking in the right travel lane.  Cadillac Mountain provides a nice view.
"Really beautiful, really crowded","Glad we spent a day, because this park is beautiful. We rode the free shuttle from the village green in Bar Harbor to the Beehive/Sand Beach & I definitely recommend the shuttle; there aren't any parking spaces anywhere near the popular trails/sights. Expect to encounter someone else (or several someones) absolutely everywhere. Be prepared for the typical human behavior (rudeness/ridiculousness). I do recommend driving the Park Loop. Great way to see the park, then come back on the shuttle to do the hotspots."
Love this park ,"Beautiful national park!! Our teenagers loved it. Hiking, rocky shores, and popovers at the end of the day. We even got them up to see sunrise!!"
Beautiful. Must see!,You don't have to be a hiker or biker to enjoy this beautiful National Park. We took the vehicle tour and it was great.  Very scenic and plenty of places to stop and get out of your car to take pics and enjoy the scenery.  If you don't visit the park while you are here you will be missing out!
My favorite National Park!,"Hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing there is so much to do. Each time we visit we try something new. Take your family and have a blast!"
Beautiful place,This place is wonderful however.  There is bearley any parking. Way to many ppl here with no social skills or mannerisms. Just obnoxious tourist that are just not good ppl. They litter over croud every sight. And they dont respect the park. Ppl are ruining this wonderful park . I hope something is done before it gets ecological damaged.
Gorham Mountain and Great Head / Sand Beach for Kids,"Cannot recommend Gorham Mountain hike and Great Head / Sand Beach for kids!  Park at Sand Beach, cross the beach and the stream, and go UP the ledges.  Kids will love it!  Park at Gorham Mountain trail head parking lot and do the hike up to the top.  Great for active kids!"
Outstanding national park that has something for everyone,"This is a very accessible national park if you want to walk, hike, climb, sit on a beach, or hike to the top of one of the 12 mountains.  There are so many little areas to pull off for a good walk.  Stone bridges, quaint, secluded beaches, horse trails, and hiking everywhere.  Outstanding views from almost every spot.  Pretty much one way, so so don't pass up an opportunity to get out and stretch your legs."
Acadia National Park,A must see for nature lovers! So beautiful it’s hard to know where to look. If you have multiple days do a hike if you have 1-2 days make sure you try Cadillac Mountain to watch the sunrise first in the US. You must get there at least an hour ahead as there are about 150 parking spots and once they are gone you’ll have to try and nab a spot somewhere else along the mountain side to catch the sunrise. Dress warm it’s chilly in the morning.  Jordan’s pond for and the beach for water experiences. Be warned Maine water is chilly even in July. The views from even just driving were spectacular.
Majestic,"Majestic views, we went on a bus tour with a knowledgeable guide who told great stories and pointed out interesting buildings and sights"
Great national park,This place offers something for everyone.  It is very accessible and I would recommend using the bus service as parking can be difficult.
Absolutely beautiful!,"Have heard so many ppl over the years say we need to go to Acadia, and now I know why!!! Lakes, Mountains, and oceans!  Beautiful hikes and trails look like they have been professionally landscaped with the wildflowers and blooming shrubs, the fragrant air, with pine, and blooms and sea air!  Bike the carriage trails. Have lunch at Jordan Pond house. See the sunrise at Cadillac Mountain. So much to see and do! Now we are among those that will tell others, “you have to see Acadia NP!”"
If you like to hike....,Visited for 4 days to take photos and hike! Easy access to all hiking trails as the park is relatively small (comparing to other national parks).
"WOW, Beautiful, Beautiful","Somany varied trails to hike, so tough, some fairly easy, but all have beautiful scenery overlooking Bar Harbor and surrounding areas.  The loop road is very interesting by auto. Cadillac Mountain is a must when at Sunrise."
Beautiful park!,"We visited here on a Tuesday and while it did get quite crowded towards the afternoon, it was very calm in the morning and apparently far less crowded that other days during the week/weekend. We got there early around 8:30, parked at the sand beach parking lot (which fills up quickly), then walked a short distance to the Beehive trail which was amazing for those who want a short, adrenaline pumping hike up metal rungs and cliff ledges. Then came back down, stopped and enjoyed Sand Beach for awhile. After that we walked the Ocean Path to Thunder Hole and Otter Cliffs. From there we took the Island Explorer to Jordan Pond. The Island Explorer is a great free feature. It was an all around beautiful place. We also spent time in the park sections of Schoodic Peninsula which was well worth the ferry ride over and breathtaking as well as the Bass Harbor Lighthouse which was a cool experience."
Beautiful but terrible signage,"We had only half a day, so wanted to drive the loop road and up to Cadillac mountain. Got to Cadillac fine but then discovered that the road turned to one way - against us. We had no choice but to exit the park into Bar Harbor. If there were signs or warnings that the loop road turned to one-way, we sure didn't see them."
Wonderful Park,I loved everything about this park. I loved that most of it was one way so you could be sure and see all the things you can see and want to see and it has plenty of pull offs so you can get out and enjoy the scenery!
Nice,"Beautiful views, the sand beach was wonderful however we were not told dogs weren't allowed after spending $30 on entry fee. I find that a great disservice to family's that travel w/ pets! The lady @ the visitor center (who sold us the entry ticket), knew we had a dog, she pet the dog, talked about her dog but never once mentioned the dog was not allowed on the beach! When we arrived to the beach, the beach nazi stormed over and said dogs were not allowed and we needed to leave immediately. Meanwhile, another dog was digging in the sand having a wonderful time while my dog simply stood there! She did tell them to leave as well but continued to glare at us even when the dog was on the rocks! Lady, get a life! She watched until we all got on the trail out. Seriously! Needless to say, they just want your money, get u in & out. It put a damper on our day, the views were nice but once you've seen so many trees, you've seen enough. It takes a long time to go around as well. We wouldn't go back."
Best Stop on our Trip,Had the very best time touring and hiking in Acadia National Park.  The view from Cadillac Mountain should not be missed!
Love this place.,"If you are a hiker, this is paradise! Primitive camping is great too. Views from mountain cannot be explained or truly captured by a camera. Third trip here and will come back!"
Heaven on Earth in the summer!!,"A trip through Acadia is very peaceful and serene. There are a lot of stopping spots for scenic views, and in the summer, it can be moderately crowded. We set up chairs on the rock cliffs and watched the waves crash the shore for hours. Take some hiking boots or a bike and enjoy this gem!!"
So beautiful,"The park is so beautiful.  I would highly recommend hiking a trail so you get the full experience of the park.  It gets crowded, so go in the morning to enjoy before the crowds come."
National Beauty,"I'm still making my way to as many national parks as I can, so Acadia was on my list. We were only able to spend 1.5 days in and around the park, so we took the advice of the park ranger and started the Loop Drive early in the morning. The shuttle stops at each main site every 30 minutes. The road is one way from the northern point of the loop until Jordan Pond. It is two-way from just south of Jordan Pond until just past Cadillac Mtn. We chose to follow the one-way portion first. I'm unsure if it matters, since the park is so crowded this time of year. We stopped at Thunder Hole area. By mid-morning the parking along Sand Beach was quite lengthy. The beach was beautiful, especially appreciated since most national parks aren't located along the ocean. Jordan Pond had no parking at noon and Cadillac Mountain's access road was closed by rangers in the afternoon. Know your tide tables, so you can make the most of low tide. We hiked across the land bridge from Bar Harbor at low tide. In the afternoon we headed to The Quietside and hiked around Beach Mountain. The ranger said it was a moderate trail. It seemed a good representative trail and had some pretty vistas of Long Pond. We also went to Ship Harbor and hiked out to the ocean. This was the only place we encountered mosquitoes. The lighthouse was interesting to see, but the parking entrance was tight and the lot was crowded."
Amazing time,Acadia is a wonderful place to visit. The views are amazing! It has many locations to pull over and see things. The crowds can be a little overwhelming. We went up to Cadillac Mountain for sunrise which was just perfection.
Beehive - Jordan Pond hike,"We got a chance to see cadillac mountain, do the beehive (must do) and bike and hike around Jordan pond. We were there for 3 days and have a longing to go back again and do more!!! This park is a must see for everyone!!  There are not enough words to describe how great it is."
1 Day in Acadia,"I would have loved to have more time, but I had 1 day, so I did as much as I could.  I followed the Loop Road to see the sights and this worked out perfectly for me.  Drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain, put my feet in at Sand Beach,  missed the pop overs at Jordan's (the wait was just too long for my limited amount of time), but every sight was gorgeous.  If you have to do it in one day, the Loop Road is the way to go!"
Amazing National Park - A Must Visit,"Well worth the visit - gorgeous scenery, plethora of options for hiking, biking, fishing and much more.  Perfect for families."
The best National Park,"Acadia National Park has a monolith - Cadillac mountain; a lake - Eagle Lake, a Pond - Jordon Pond and beautiful greenery. Thunder Hole is amazing. Carriage Road is a hikers & bikers paradise. A absolute must-see!"
"My Visit to Acadia NP June 29, 2019","Too bad the Visitors centers is a strong walk uphill, it should be at the parking lot level. The ranger staff was great; with the volume at the Visitors Center they should have more rangers to assist. The park itself was great; Cadillac Mountain is a must visit if you can get a parking spot.Sand beach is very replacing place too. Hammocks to sit a spell would be nice.  Walking sticks help navigate the trails. Bring bug repellent some flies bite."
"""Beautiful, breathtaking scenery""","Our family had visited Bar Harbor, ME and Acadian National Park for the first time. This place was so beautiful and amazing. There are so many places to stop along the scenic road through Acadia and there are many places to hike as well. There are even waterfalls that you can hike to in the park. There are many scenic areas to stop and park and walk down on the roads to see the ocean waves splashing against the rocks. The views were amazing and were breathtaking. I shared some of the pictures that I took.There are several areas tahatyou can climb down on the rocks along the scenic loop road through the park. You need to wear comfortable shows that give you traction. Some of the rocks can be slippery and you can easily fall. Some of the areas are also uneven terrain so you need to be careful when walking around so do not fall.The park cost $ 30.00 for a 7 day pass through the National Park Service and it was so worth it. The park has a gift shop as well with unique gifts and one of a kind treasures from Acadia to take home with you.There is parking off scenic pullouts and as well as some parking lots as well. There are two lanes in each direction through the park and guests are allowed to park int he right lane and there is only one lane going through in each direction at times. Just be careful pulling in and out of traffic in the park. Also be on the lookout for moose and other wildlife as well.We loved visiting Acadia National Park and would definitely visit again in a heartbeat and I highly recommend it!"
"Hard to pick a favorite, but...","Acadia NP might possibly be our favorite. We’ve visited quite a few NPs from Alaska and Hawaii to Montana, Utah, and Colorado to Tennessee and Maine...ANP definitely ranks in the top three. We love the carriage trails, hiking, biking, the ocean, the mountains/hills, the forest, the streams, the vistas...all of it! It is AMAZING year-round — all seasons though certainly most crowded during July and August (just like almost every other NP!)Maine...the way life should be!"
WOW!!!,"This place is AMAZING!!!  We didn't know what to expect since this was our first trip to Maine, but it was heaven.  The park is huge and so well maintained.  It has something for everyone.We took our bikes and did we ever get a workout!  There are carriage trails through the mountains and you can hike or bike on them.  We did so every day, but I must tell you it was quite a challenge, but the sights and experience were terrific.  And it gave us a good excuse to chow down on some extra calories at dinner.The views, atmosphere and being in the middle of all the beautiful nature was something I'll never forget!"
Beautiful Park,"Not much to add--thousands of other reviews.  Beautiful park, nice drives, hiking trails, great views.  Carriage trails (gravel roads/paths) were an added bonus for morning jogs.  A bit more of a manicured park vs. wilderness but definitely worth a visit."
America's Beauty,What a gorgeous park with trails if you are walking or biking and roads if you are on a shuttle or in your car.  Great places to park to see the wonderful views.  Everything from the beach to the thunder hole.  Allow plenty of time to see it all.
"Acadia Nat Park, an unlikely blend civilized, rugged & serene","Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island has it all. The town of Bar Harbor on the eastern edge of the park is both tourist cute and old Down East quaint. There's no shortage of good restaurants and charming shops. Whale watching, kayak rentals, guided fishing trips, are just a few of the available activities. The view from the village green overlooking the harbor basically sums up what draws people to this region. The rocky and tree-covered shoreline, the boats tethered at docks while other anchored offshore all display the many reasons why people find this town irresistible. Nearby Cadillac Mt draws crowds by car and by foot. The view from the top is serene.both a mixture of expansive ocean, beautiful islands, and the rugged landscape of coniferous forest, and windblown shrugs clinging to rock outcrops. Sunrises are spectacular up there. Acadia Nat Park has countless hiking trails leading to sparkling lakes and ponds. Mainers tend to understate things so a small lake is often referred to as a pond but they're often surprisingly large. But you'll find after a while that understatement is a state of mind that seems just right."
One of the best National Parks,Acadia is amazing.  From Sand Beach to Cadillac Mountain to Thunder Hole it is a treasure.  Plan on spending at least two days and a third day to spend on the water.
A must see,"Make sure you make it to the top of Cadillac Mountain for an great trip and increduible views. The beach is nice but really crowded on nice day - you may have to walk a mile if you arrive at peak hours. Thunderhole is great, but only if you are there two hours before high tide and there is an ocean swell - I have missed the show 9 times out of 10. Be careful getting down to it."
One day trip to Acadia National Park,I went with high expectations visiting Acadia national park. I have visited other national parks as Yosematie and Yellowstone which were really amazing. For a one day trip Acadia is a good place to visit. There are very few things to really see in this park. If you love hiking this is a really good place. The main attraction I felt was the beach. Beach was really excellent and well situated. Other attractions doesn't take that much time to cover. Compare to parks in the western side of the US this park can be avoided as there are other parks in this region that offers more.
Scenic Outdoor Wonder,"Very affordable! $30 per car load - good for entire week. We travelled with friends - all of whom had children ranging in ages from 15 months to 15 years. The nature was picturesque and breathtaking. The view from Cadillac Mountain is gorgeous. Take Gorge Path to enjoy an adventurous hike. We heard about the Thunder Hole, unfortunately missed it. Sandy beach and picnic areas are plentiful. So glad we experienced this with our children and some very close friends. Would love to come back some day!!"
Wonderful,"We love our National Parks anyway and Acadia didn't let us down.  Loved driving to the top of Cadillac Mountain and the view is unforgettable.  Spent about 10 minutes watching a porcupine up close and personal, it was so freaking cool!!!!"
Beautiful sights,Cadillac Mountain summit sunrise is awesome. Bubble Pond was a beautiful sight from the peaks. We hiked the mountains with the dogs. Nothing too challenging for our four legged family members.
Incredible!,The views from this park are amazing! My husband and I were visiting Portland and decided to make the 3 hr drive to the park. So glad that we did!!
This park has it all,"Acadia is beautiful and varied. There are mountains, wooded trails, ponds, streams, and glorious ocean views. The hiking trails run from smooth and easy to very challenging. Bicyclists will love the carriage roads and kayakers the ocean and lakes. Spread around Mount Desert Island, the park offers something for everyone. Bar Harbor is lively in the warm months and the western side of the island is quiet for those wanting peace and relaxation. Those who live year-round on the island are welcoming."
Maine trip,"Acadia National Park is a beautiful area to visit. We went to the top of Cadillac Mountain for the sunset which was incredible. We went to Frenchman Bay, Schooner head, Sand Beach and Jordon pond. We had lunch at Jordan Pond House which was very good. There was a large crowd but we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table and our food came very quickly."
Beautiful easy hike.  Lots of families & dogs!,Spent a lovely morning going around the exquisite Jordan Pond.  About 3.4 miles around the entire pond.  We started clockwise from the entrance.  This side boasts more marshy areas that are traversed via raised platforms.  Volunteers were adding to the platforms so we were detoured a little ways through the woods.  A bit muddy after heavy rains.  The next section is mostly granite rock which is fun for those without mobility issues.  The other side of the pond boasts a broad firm-packed walkway.  Everyone brings their pets to Acadia so be aware.  Parking on a busy (beautiful) day may be difficult.  Best to arrive earlier or later for the most serene experience.
Great Hiking!!!,Great hiking trails with easy access parking areas are set among some of the most breath-taking scenery on the east coast.
Breathtaking views,"It is worth the drive to get to the top of Cadillac Mountain (named for Mr. Cadillac).  The park is serious about erosion and conservation, not allowing visitors to walk on the rocks, and not allowing more than 2 buses at a time at the top, for a stop of only 20 minutes.  Parking is a walk from the vistas, but well worth it all to take in the view.  It must be spectacular in autumn."
Beautiful area,"We did so much in the park, Cadillac Mtn., Jordan's Pond, walked from Sand Beach to Thunder Hole (great overlooks and rock formations), hiked Acadia Mtn., Otter's Cove, so many great things to do. The drive is very scenic, a definite must do!!"
We did the park in a half day (twice!) by driving ,"Simply stunning! So we arrived here on a bad weather day but boy was it worth going back the second day! The first day was Sunday June 30 and raining and the parking lots were either half or mostly empty due to the weather. The second day we had a bit of a late start and it was much busier but not overwhelming. We did not do any hikes. Here are tips:1. Car or shuttle? - I was told time and time again don’t drive but I decided to ignore the advice and take my chances and I’m glad I did. This was my experience so perhaps it could differ as we get further into summer but when we went it was a bad weather day mid afternoon and driving was fine! The road was completely open for driving throughout the park unlike places like the Grand Canyon where it’s closed partly to only buses. We were fine the next day too which was a Monday and very Sunny. Again all roads open for major attractions including sandy beach, thunder hole, Cadillac mountain and Jordan pond. If you take the car and it’s a sunny day, start early!! We took a drive out to sea wall and didn’t get to Acadia for the second day until about 915. Sandy beach was pretty full In terms of parking and so was Jordan pond. Cadillac mountain was totally full and there was a wait for parking. People also weren’t quick to leave. 2. When to go and can you do it all: like I said above start early if you have nice weather! Like 730 or 8 so you can take time at the popular sites. If you do this you may be able to visit all the popular sites by car. Start with sandy beach, then thunderhole, ottercliff, Cadillac mountain and then Jordan pond. 3. Buy an America beautiful park pass if you’ll be visiting this park for several days and other parks in the us: one day pass for a car is 30 and the pass for a year is 80 unless you’re retired.4. Visitor center: worth stopping by to get maps and visit the shop. Some nice souvenirs but tee shirts are overpriced and you can find some nice ones in town at bar harbor. There are lots of steps going up but there’s also an accessible entrance. Restrooms also here.5. Sandy beach: a must stop! No dogs allowed. Public restrooms. Beautiful view. Parking lot fills up fast. If you don’t find parking here get out of the lot and park on park loop rd. 6. Otter cliff: signs aren’t readily visible. Parking is right before you get to a bend with tiered walled roads that split in two. Park before you get to the tier and walk across the street. Lovely views here on the rocks. 7. Thunder hole: hit or miss. Visited TWICE and no action unfortunately. We went at low tide and two hours before high tide and even stayed an hour but no action. Heard that action happens when there’s a storm and it’s two hours before high tide. Who knows though. Restrooms here but think they were the outhouse kind. Also a small gift shop and parking lot. 8. Jordan pond: parking lot at the house but also for just those visiting the pond a little further down the road. Nice views and worth the stop. Food is not worth the stop. Wrote a review about it and you can check it out. Restrooms available here. 9. Cadillac mountain: go early as this gets busiest fast! People also spend time up here so parking doesn’t change over quickly. Great views. If you can’t find parking there are a few pull over places on the way down with nice views too. 10. Last tips. Part of park loop is one way. Cadillac and Jordan has areas of two way lanes. There are adjacent and perpendicular roads but pay attention to signs because they’re easily missed and the next thing you know you’re driving around the whole park again! Cell service is very spotty so don’t think google maps will save the day. Don’t stay past close to dusk as the park empties quickly and it’s easy to get lost as there are no road lights in the park. People frequently park in the right lane on the one way roads so watch out! Lots of pedestrians on roads to in random places so take care!"
Didn't Want To Leave,"We spent a week in Bar Harbor and went to Acadia every day. It is so beautiful, rain or shine. Our first day there it was raining hard but we saw some beautiful waterfalls that day. On the sunny days, we got up early and were at the park by around 6 am in order to beat the crowds so we could look for wildlife and do some hiking. We particularly enjoyed seeing the nesting peregrine falcons and their fledglings at Precipice Trail and also on the carriage road above Jordan Pond. There is so much to see and do but you have to get out of your car and hit the trails or carriage roads to really experience all the park has to offer, especially the wonderful smell of Christmas trees.Traffic was not bad during the early morning hours and we usually left by noon everyday. Be careful before starting any trails and don't start without a map, especially if you are not used to climbing rocks. Our only complaint would be the water runoff problem at Hulls Cove Visitors Center. When it is raining, water is rushing down the path and steps that you have to walk up to the building. It was like a water fall and then was puddled 3"" deep at the bottom. There was no way to walk around the water so everyone was having to walk through it. Our shoes and socks were soaked. Someone needs to fix that soon."
Beautiful national Park,We went for day trip from recent cruise. The park is so beautiful. Lots of hiking trails and amazing views from catillac mountain. We also went to sand beach and thunder hole. Public bathrooms were clean. Lots of one way roads when driving so pay attention.
Wonderful and stunning ,"Very nice national park, wear your good walking/hiking shoes, there is wonderful trails and places to go. Enjoy!!"
Worth seeing. Beautiful view,"I took a tour bus from Bar Harbor through Acadia Park.  The tour was wonderful and we learned a lot of history.  My tour stopped at the top of Cadillac Mountain, thunder hole, and Jordan's Pond.  If you are on a cruise ship like I was this if the way to see this area."
Great Hiking & Beautiful,"The national park is so beautiful and if you are a hiker this is the place to go. The weather can be dicey, a lot of rain at times. Have to catch it on a good day."
Amazing!,We took the Loop Road by car.  It was $30 and we were given a map of all the sights to see.  We spent the entire day here and it was incredible.  Absolutely beautiful!  I highly recommend
Great time with family and great views everywhere. ,We have a fairly sedate family. So we didn’t do much hiking.  We did enjoy stopping along the way and seeing sand beach and thunder hole and all those rocks between those two points. The kids said they did like Cadillac mountain.  The drive close to veal harbor is beautiful on the loop. We drove out of the park to a little town for lunch close to seal harbor and then hopped back on and kept driving. It was not crowded and we were not stopped in long delays as cars backed up so if you did just want to cruise around you could make the entire loop in an hour.
Something for Everyone,There are so many trails and they can be super challenging to easy.  We were there in May before peak season so it wasn't crowded.
National treasure!,This is a national park that should not be missed! A great option for those travelling from warmer states in the summer. Temperatures were in the 70's in July. The hiking is wonderful. Trails marked as moderate are accurately designated. Natural beauty abounds in this exceptional national park!
Must See National Park,"We visited the park 3 different days while staying in Bar Harbor. Highlights were Cadillac Mountain, walk around Jordan Pond, and the many places to take pictures of the harbor."
Auspicious Acadia,"Get a feel for the history of this area before entering the park, itself by strolling the history markers throughout Bar Harbor. Then, you can truly appreciate why this landscape is being preserved. Take your time and meander. Rely on the public transportation after the end of June to decrease impact on the ecosystem."
Nature at its best,"This park is beautiful and has been designed to make it easy for people of all abilities to enjoy. Judging from the crowd control infrastructure, though, it may be very crowded at the height of the season. So, consider going a bit before or after for a better experience."
All in one place,"A very nice national park with lots of options of things to see and do.  Cadillac Mountain was a good place to visit, but windy, windy,windy.  The small gardens were nonetheless fun to visit.  Caught thunder hole at the wrong time of the da and it was more of a gurgle than a thunder."
Very pretty shoreline,"We’re from out west so have a different reference point for national parks...this one is nice but isn’t drop dead amazing like many we go to out west.  The rock beaches are actually very cool and have amazing rocks and pebbles that are worn perfectly smooth.  The mosquitoes will eat you alive if you aren’t covered in something, and even then, sometimes they will still eat you.  Acadia Mountain is a decent hike but again, hard to say that a mountain that is 600 ish feet tall is really a mountain.  Tide pools were cool.  We got lucky and found parking every time we wanted to do something, apparently this is not the norm.  The weather is highly variable even on the same day in the same hike so have choices with you.  If you’re here, it’s worth seeing."
What a park!,"Incredible National Park, and a must do if you are in the area.  From the water, to the streams, to the history, to the rocks....you have to give it a try.We traveled in June and the park was not overly crowded.  Recommend picking up a Junior Ranger book, especially if you have children, as it gives interesting facts and things to look for.We only had one day, and it was not enough.  I would have loved to have had more time to spend in Acadia."
Nature at its best..,"Had the opportunity to experience what Acadia National park has to offer, beautiful and natural, rich in history and places to visit."
A day is not enough,"I have been here before and this time we had our grandson with us.  We spent a couple days touring the park and enjoying hiking, Cadillac Mountain, Sand Beach and Seal Harbor,  The park has amazing views and is a great place to visit."
it's a must to make when you go to Bar Harbor,"this park is very beautifull, you have a see of the sea with nothings else than nature. the mountain are beautifull with a lot of trail to make. you will love this park, and since it's a national park, if you have your Yearly pass it's free to enter there !!! good visit"
Beautiful,"Such a beautiful park. Lots of trails. We walked around Jordan pond, took us two hours at a slow pace. Fun family activity. Not for little ones though."
So Much to Do,"Acadia National Park is a beautiful place to experience nature. There are many paths to hike, places to see and experience, horse trails, and carriage rides. There are camp grounds and cafes. It is a very diverse park with many things for everyone. If you want to get out with a family this is a fantastic place."
Free Shuttle to All the Best Locations,"Go to the Visitors Center first. Park for free if you have a National Parks Pass. (I have a Seniors Pass.) You only need to walk up the 52 steps to the Visitors Center if you need to buy a Park Pass. Get on the shuttle. (The #4 is the primary shuttle that goes everywhere in a little over an hour.) Get off at any stop (or not), check it out, get on a later shuttle. See beaches, trails, overlooks, picnic areas. If you know in advance which stop you want to visit (Sandy Beach for example), read the signs at the Visitors Center bus stop and get on the express shuttle to your location. Save on gas. Save the environment."
Beautiful Park - Hikers Paradise,Loved hiking in Acadia.  There is a hike for everyone's ability.  We stayed in Otter Creek so were able to access some trailheads minutes from our AirBnB.  I'd recommend staying in a place where you don't have to park.  A lot more convenient.
"Over Crowded, But Beautiful","The scenery is gorgeous, but because it was so crowded it was hard to enjoy. Parking anywhere was a big challenge and bicycles kept cutting off cars. I would recommend going here off season if possible to truly enjoy the scenery."
Acadia National Park beauty at it's best!,"Acadia National Park beauty at it's best!  What stunning views and scenic pictures. No visit is complete without a visit. Make this a must stop when visiting Bar Harbor, Maine."
good bicycling,"good bicycling, but kept on raining, and the bugs were plentiful.  Scenery is best on the Park Loop Road.  The carriage trails are just woods."
Beautiful National Park,Loop road and carriage roads were beautiful. Parking was not an issue in early June even though there were many tourists.Popovers and stew for lunch at Jordan Pond provided a perfect break followed by an interesting hike around the pond. Hike up to Bubble Rock was challenging with all of the mosquitoes but was worth the effort.
Awesome experience,"Rented bikes and did 22 miles of gravel roads in park...incredible views. Made loop around Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond, also saw rivers and a waterfall!"
Acadia National Park,Acadia National Park is a true treasure.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking!  Make sure to see Thunder Hole!
Very nice park,Bought park pass at visitor center in Bar Harbor.  Park Loop road very nice especially the one way section with plenty of areas to pull off and directional signs very good.
Beautiful,"a beautiful park  Be sure to do the Loop drive for great views of the coast.  Take advantage of biking, hiking."
Scenic views of a great National Park on the coast of Maine,"This was our third visit to one of the best National parks.  It has great views of Maine's east coast.  The rocky coast line, small beaches, trails, rocky mountain tops with fantastic views, small lakes/ponds, pine tree forests, windy roads, carriage roads....all great things to see and experience.  We will visit again."
Gorgeous Park,Acadia is seriously underrated! Such a gorgeous place to spend the day. I believe the $30 per vehicle gets you a three day pass to the park. Lots of places to pull over and hike or have lunch. We witnessed a beautiful wedding ceremony taking place on the cliffs. Stunning views!
Beautiful views,"We took a guided tour for a couple of hours.  As others have said, the views from the top of Cadillac Mountain are beautiful.  The history of the area is interesting.  Well worth a visit."
Small but beautiful,Smaller than most parks but beautiful scenery. Worth a day or two walking and hiking. I suggest early season before the crowds are too large but a busy park anytime.
Amazing!,"Such an amazing National Park with beautiful vistas.  Was only in town for a day, so was only able to see a small portion.  Will definitely plan to return and explore more!"
Wonderful National Park near the Maine Coast,"We entered the Acadia National Park and drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain.  At the summit, we realized we needed a Park Pass.  Cadillac Mountain is the highlight of Acadia.  It is a fun drive and has lot of great views at the summit.  We stopped by the Jordan Pond gift shop to buy souvenirs and the park pass.  Initially, I thought $30 was a much little for Acadia National Park.  It was nice, but I thought overpriced.Then, Jordan Pond saved the day.  We returned to Jordan Pond, and it made the Park Pass worthwhile.  Jordan Pond is a beautiful relaxing place.  I would imagine the hike around this big pond would be awesome.We enjoyed the drive around Acadia National Park.  Acadia National Park isn't near the level of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountains or Crater Lake.  However, it is a nice park in Maine and one of the best attractions."
Loved Acadia National Parkw,"We loved Acadia National Park.  The highlights were Sand Beach, the Great Head hike, the Otter Cliff coastline, Cadillac mountain, and we actually hiked and liked Acadia mountain on the other side of the island as well.  We did think that Jordan Pond was underwhelming for the hype.  We also went over to the Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse which probably wasn't worth the drive over.  Basically any of the mountains with views over the ocean or hikes along the ocean, we thought were stunning and amazing."
Absolutely Beautiful,"Acadia may be a smaller National Park, but it has plenty to see and do. That is why you will want at least 3 days and more if possible to experience this park. Take a hike as there are easy to very demanding hiking trails.The scenery on one of these hikes is remarkable. Take a bus tour to hear the information and gain a better understanding of the park and how it came to be. Take a carriage ride if time and weather permits. Do not forget your camera as between the shoreline scenery and the mountaintop vistas you will want to save the experience. We came at the request of our daughter and boy were we glad we visited. Outstanding park."
Beautiful Park,"The weather was very nice the day we were there, albeit a bit chilly.  Cadillac summit was fogged in so the views were optimal.  Hikes for people of every capabilities.  Many bridges, some dating back to the 20s."
Our Favorite National Park-a Giant Playpen For Everyone,"We brought our children here and now our grandchildren. We have been averaging a visit every three years for the last 30 years. Hiking, biking and kayaking are all top notch. Hiking is great because you can find trails for all ages. Great views from the top and many super views going up or coming down or both. Some have ladders, some iron rungs and others with beautiful granite steps. Scrabbling over rocks is fun for all ages. The biking trails were once carriage trails and one can still book a ride on a carriage but bikes are perfect. Many beautiful bridges were built and are beautiful as well as functional. As you bike up mountains you are rewarded by ever expanding ocean views. Kayaking can be in the ocean or on placid ponds. Views and wildlife are beyond words. Throw in some Jordan Pond popovers and Beals’s Lobsters and life gets no better."
Great family vacation!,"Our entire family with six children ranging from age 7-20 enjoyed our vacation to Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor.  It is well worth the trip to visit and hike in this park with amazing views and different levels of intensity for hiking.  The park rangers were helpful with our planning, too, while there."
Breath taking views!,"Traveled to Acadia for my birthday.  The weather was perfect. We rode the Park Loop and stopped at every area that we could.  Stepped into the ocean at Sand Beach, listened in at Thunder Hole, lunched at Jordan Pond House, all beyond beautiful.  We got up for the sunrise atop Cadillac Mountain and there's just nothing like it!  We can't wait to return!"
Amazing views,"Hiking in the park was amazing, there are trails for beginners to experts. The views near the coastline are so beautiful I did not want to leave!"
Oh to walk and enjoy the smell of the ocean and the views,walked and ate and breathed the air...paradise.  Recommend this beautiful park.  Bring your hiking gear and your appetite!
Awesome,"Took a tour with a local company.  Was better than driving on your own, unless you plan on picking or doing trails.  This is a beautiful place."
Gorgeous Inside and Out,"I did an organized tour that took us around the ring road of Acadia and to the top of Cadillac Mountain.  The interior of Acadia is as beautiful as anything you are likely to see on the east coast: round-top mountains, grassy fields, streams, lakes with beaver huts, wildflowers, etc.  The coastline is a crazy bonus with large rocky outcroppings challenging the sea waves, lobster boats, sea birds and lighthouses.  Cadillac mountain rises out of the surroundings as a mass of green lichen covered pink granite interspersed with wildflowers providing 360 degree views to Bar Harbor, Egg Island and the general beauty of Mount Desert Island.  I'd like to go back and ride the coat roads inside the park to really enjoy the natural beauty."
Stunning Fall Color,"I went this is National Park in early October, and the weather was amazing, and the color was just the best. The views are breathtaking. My 4 years old and I hiked to Bubble Rock, and it was so much fun and very memorable."
Family Vacation,This is a beautiful national park. Great views. The beach was interesting but the water was really cold. It was a rainy day so the drive up the mountain was limited to no vis. The park rangers were helpful at the ranger station to the entrance ofThe park.
Missing Trail & Cadillac Mtn,We crossed the bar to get Bar Island and were told there was a trail to a great view....could not find it and trail became a bit to treacherous for sneakers.  Sunset at Cadillac Mtn is a must see but be prepared....it can get cold and windy!
Great park to visit!,"Loved this part...it has everything!  Mountains, ocean, lakes, streams, critters and views that take your breath away.  Went for several hikes that we thoroughly enjoyed.  The hike up to Mt. Acadia was a bit strenuous for us old folks but worth the time and effort it took to get to the top.  Glad we had bug nets over our hats because the black flies were relentless.  Loved our visit to this national park."
Amazing Coastal Views,Best part in May no crowds.  Amazing views at each of our stops.  Cadillac Mt. experience is really special from all angles. Coastal walks are so beautiful as every view changes with each step.
Nothing but a rip off,"If you already (1) have an annual national park pass and (2) you are already in the area, and (3) you have time and nothing else to do, I guess this is an option.  Otherwise, this is a rip-off and a poor excuse of a “National Park”!  If you want to see the same things, for free, just drive across Maine, or Vermont, or upper New York, or New Hampshire.  We are not ""outdoorsey"" people, but we have seen and raved about ""similar"" National parks out west like Yellowstone, Sequoia, and the Redwoods.  Acadia is nothing like their majesty and beauty."
Hiking and Views,"Definitely a bucket list stop.  Hike the trails, take the time to see what Acadia has to offer.  This place is beautiful!!.  Easy to navigate.  Advice:  Buy your park pass online to save time."
A Must see if visiting Maine,This area is absolutely beautiful. We drove ourselves for the tour of the area and were not disappointed with the awesome views and picturesque scenery. We can't wait to get back to this area someday and spend more time exploring as we only had a one day stop here on this trip.
Breathtakingly beautiful!,This is a national park for good reason! The vistas are spectacular!  The hiking trails are well laid out and they have trails for all abilities.    We went before school closed in June so it wasn't awfully crowded.  I hear it can be quite so in the months of July and August.   The park has both forest hikes and ones along the shore. I would recommend getting a guide book before hand to learn about each trail.
Amazing at every turn,"WOW! This was our first visit to Maine, let alone New England. We had our sights set on exploring Acadia NP since the minute we booked our vacation. There are so many trails, we probably only hiked about 8 or so. Everytime we turned a corner there was an even better view.It only cost us $30 for the week for the pass. If you enter by Sand Beach, there is a wait to get through the park gate even if you have a pass, don't worry, just show the ranger and be on your way.We hiked The Beehive, Gorham Trail,  Jordan Pond, Ovean Path, Bubble Trail, The Bowl, Great Head Trail, and more. Sand Beach was awesome. Huge waves crashing on the beach. Water is a little cold though, right around 45°F-50°F. There were nice changing facilities there as well.We lucked out, we had fantastic weather and the crowds hadn't hit yet.Definitely check out Acadia NP!I am only allowed to upload 10 pics. I have so many great pictures. They do it no justice! Go Now!"
Don't miss if in Maine!!,"We had a great experience visiting here. You can drive it yourself or take a tour. We did both: did a tour [Oli's Trolley] and then drove the loop road ourselves for more in depth looksee's. The park is extensive with rugged coastlines, small mountains, lakes, beaches, etc.The scenery was beautiful, we did early June so no crowds!! A stop at Jordan Pond for popovers is a tradition. Can't say enough but don't miss if in the area."
Beautiful park,Gorgeous national park.  The park loops is an enjoyable ride around and the paths that don't allow cars are fun to walk down.  Campsites are nice and the views are spectacular.  Definitely a park to cross off your bucket list.
A true National Treasure!,"Acadia is a beautiful, accessible National Park.  Wonderful vista's, beautiful scenery.  There is a nice loop road to take a driving tour, a nice paved path for a weeks and lots of hiking trails."
Four must-see places in Acadia,"Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond (can walk all the way around it, but some difficult places, like rocks and a long stretch of handrail-free planks; 3.3 miles in circumference), Thunder Hole (go an hour or two before high tide), Sand Beach"
beautiful,"reliably beautiful visit to a unique coastal experience.  and we saw a seal. ocean path is popular but essential.  hint: park is open 24/7, go at dusk to jordan pond or eagle lake for a quiet, private experience."
MUST GO,"This park is one of the most beautiful parks i have ever been too! make sure to get a ticket in, we didnt realize you needed one and got a parking ticket, which was easy re mediated once we went and paid up."
Beautiful park,Well maintained trails with good signage.  Lots of hiking options for different ability levels.  Wide range of scenery from mountain to ocean.  Simply stunning.
Amazing views!,"The views are amazing, you can see for miles once you get to the top of the mountain. Carriage trails are great for biking or hiking, the bridges are beautiful. Lots of hiking for all levels of hikers. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the map you get when you pay the entrance fee is terrible. There are trails not listed on the map. You get to a trail head and trying to figure out which directions to go was a bit confusing, since there are many different trails/directions to take. My husband and I met a nice young man that was a local and stopped him to see if we were headed in the right direction. He asked if we had the Park map and said it ""stinks"" (his word was much worse). He let us take a picture of his map with our phones, which was a big help. Also not a lot of information about what to expect as some trails have ladders and rungs and there can be some rock scrambling.  Spring or early to mid summer is not the best time to go if you want to do the Precipice, the Falcons are nesting during this time. So it is best to check with Park to see when this trail is open.  Most important get a map that has hiking and biking trails or an app on your phone that you can download maps ( sometimes no cell phone service on mountain)."
Breathtaking ,"So beautiful! We took a guided tour and it was absolutely amazing. That being said, I definitely think you need more than a day!"
Great place to visit.,This is a awesome place from the top of the mountain you have great views in all directions. Get there before daylight and you can watch the sun rise.
"Nice national park, weather permitting",We enjoyed top of Cadillac mountain on a clear day. but not worth a visit if weather is not clear skies.
Live here,Great place to visit  but over crowed. Best time is in the Fall. Finding places to park are hard to find.
Visit to beautiful Acadia Nat'l Park,"Spent 2 days visiting Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME. What a hidden gem! We hiked over 10 miles of trails (varying ability levels), visited park visitor centers, and drove the loop trail. Roads and trails in park are in great condition. Roads and trails are well-marked. Maps available at visitor centers. If you plan on doing an hiking beyond the short (1-2 mile) loop trails, highlly recommend purchasing a trail map for $6-10. These typo maps are well done and include add'l hiking info. Restrooms were very clean and in good repair. Park staff were very friendly and helpful. Would suggest adding this Nat'l Park to your bucket list."
Mountains and Lakes and Ocean..All in One,"One of the more scenic National Parks in entire North East, Acadia makes it to the list of Top 10 (or Top 20) National Parks in United States. Up North in Maine and by the Ocean, the Park is saddled by the Ocean so has hikes going up the mountain (and to the water), and all in the middle . Jordan Pond, Sand Beach, Bee Hive and Cadillac Mountain are some of its more visited attractions."
Fantastic Trails,"You are rewarded with awesome views with moderate level hiking.  Gorham, The Bowl, the backside of the Beehive and Great Head trails are definitely worth doing."
A stunning national treasure,"Acadia National Park like all national parks it is a stunning national treasure on Desert Island close to Bar Harbor Maine. A little visited section of the park is on the Schoodic Peninsula about an 45 minute drive from Bar Harbor or in season a short ferry ride across the harbor. Wherever you choose, the views are spectacular with nature abounds."
Get your pass beforehand and drive on through ,So much to do and see. Loved Park Loop Road and my favorite was the hike along Otter Cliffs and Otter Point.
it ok,it was ok i saw good and more good must view good please good now ok i am here wait there how um how ok
Wonderful ,"Arrived Monday afternoon and it was sunny so we drove right up to top of Cadillac Mountain for views of the bay and islands. Nice paths, beautiful views! Tuesday was also good weather so we drove to the Bubbles Mountains, parked and hiked up Pemetic Mountain. The bottom starts along Jordan Pond and has beautiful boulders and easy paths. Trail goes up through the tree-root path through pines, and then changes to granite at the top. Views all around are spectacular! Markers make the route easy to follow. We hiked slowly and it was about 3 hours from bottom to top to bottom.  Ate lunch at Jordan Pond restaurant. Staff was fun and polite, and the famous popovers were perfect. So thankful to have this park!"
Day Hikers Dream,"Acadia National Park is perfect for hiking of all abilities. This was my 3rd trip here and I continue to love being in the park. The park has tons to offer those of all ages including some very easy and scenic walks/paths. However, for more serious hikers, there an incredible number of hikes and combinations of trails to create the perfect day. Trails are well marked and intermittent sign posts help navigate trail crossings. More popular hikes like the Beehive and South Bubble can get very crowded depending on day and time of year, but the park has so many other extraordinary hikes as well. The carriage roads offer another way to see the park but one I am less familiar with."
Amazing visit,Beautiful scenery with hikes at every level.  We walked 30 miles in 5 days and never thought twice about it.  Well-maintained and not overcrowded.  Will definitely be back.
Beautiful but CROWDED!,"Acadia features dramatic natural beauty on a scale that I'd typically associate with the National Parks out west.  It is a special place, no doubt about it.  Due to limited scheduling options, we visited over Memorial Day weekend and were blown away by the crowd levels - people were EVERYWHERE.  We had to forgo one planned hike because we simply couldn't find parking.  We learned that later in the summer the Island Explorer bus can be used to reach trailheads, but it wasn't running this early in the season.  That said, we were able to take advantage of a few quiet spots.  We had a lovely picnic lunch on a foggy afternoon on the rocks overlooking the shoreline along Ocean Path, and drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain close to dinnertime on a sunny evening when the crowds were thinning.  If you have the flexibility to work around peak times, this seems like a lovely place!"
Can't go here unless you see the park!,Excellent drive around the loop along with Cadillac Mountain.  Trip takes about 2 hours.  It turns into a one way so you are committed at the one way point.  Several turnouts and great signage so picture takers park on one side and cars/tour buses continue to drive by.
Flying mtn trail and jordan pond,"Back up in the park. Still refreshing and fantastic. Loved the weather, loved the trails. Does make me laugh though this is NOT a place for strollers. Dress well and wear good shoes, there sometimes is some mud. Great place."
Acadia National Park - Beautiful!!!,"While visiting Bangor, Maine we decided to make a day trip to Acadia.  So glad we did.  Because it was a little chilly with rain showers off and on when we visited, we had a peaceful, almost traffic-free drive through the park.  The scenery is just stunning.  Definitely worth a visit."
Beautiful even in the rain.,"I would highly recommend visiting right before or right after peak season to congestion, we visited in mid-May and felt like we almost had the park to ourselves."
Spectacularly beautiful,"Acadia National Park should be on everyone's list of places to visit.  Whether you're hiking, driving the loop, visiting the beautiful Sand Beach or checking out Cadillac Mountain, everywhere you look is amazing."
Beyond Beautiful,I couldn't say enough... I have been here three times and each is something different and magical. Go explore and you will be in awe.
Favorite Place,"My son and I have been to Bar Harbor and Acadia in 2007, 2009 and 2019. We love it! The most beautiful place on earth, friendliest people, delicious food in the area, so much outdoor recreation to do!! The air is fragrant with balsam, salt and wild roses!!!"
Spent 2 nights in our RV,This is a “Diamond in the Rough” National Park. It has the feel of Camping in the Forest and has rugged rocky coastlines. Lots of hiking/walking trails. We stayed in the Blackwoods Campground. Nicely spaced out Camp Sites with Bathrooms spaces around big Campground. I’m quite sure they sell out all through the summer months so plan way ahead.
Sue did a very good job.  ask for her 207  610 4074,Sue from TripAdvisor did a very good job.  207 610 4074.  very clean van.  very comfortable.  easy to get in and out.  snacks and water offered.  good deal......d
Visted in mid May.  Very cold!,"The park and nearby towns were not yet in full operation with the cold May weather, but the park was beautiful and we enjoyed not having any crowds.  Tours and hikes were fun with beautiful sights between the foggy and rainy days."
National Park on steroids,"Loved the views and the trip by bus tour.  Don't try driving by yourself, there is too much to see.  Tour is great."
Enter the park from the gardens (near the Tarn),"In season the park is a crowded and busy place because it is truly incredible, sometimes to much so! As a seasonal local I enter the park either early [well before 10am] and/or I start at the Acadia Gardens because everyday there is something to see in bloom. It is never over crowded so my park time always has a peaceful beautiful start! ... Locals will tell you the best time to be at Thunderhole is 2 hr. before high tide ... Sunrise on Cadillac is worth it (dress warm!!!!l) get there 30+ min. before sunrise! ... There is a ranger station with trail maps beside the Bar Harbor Village Green .... I recommend to everyone with family on their first Acadia Visit that their first hike/walk/bike ride be from the ""Eagle Lake"" parking lot (Rt#3) because it is easy, pretty, and lots of variety to see ... If you have bikes bring them! ... Wild blueberries grown in rocky open areas all over the park enjoy as many as you like, but leave rocks where you found them!"
The reason we vacationed in April,Probably a silly time of year to visit Acadia National Park but that was the only time one of the three of us could get away.  It was pouring down rain the whole time we were here and foggy as you drove higher up.  But it was still worth the trip here.  The views were beautiful even in the rain.  We planned to stay for two days but then we found out that none of the tours open until later in May so we only stayed one day and one night.Glad we got a chance to see this beautiful national park.
Perfect place for family hiking,"Only had a day here, but very accessible for all ages, including anyone with disabilities. Informatiion well presented and interesting. Glorious 360 Views from Cadillac Mountain. History of Park well worth reading. Doing a great job Conservation wise."
Beautiful!,"First time in the Acadia National Park. So fun and beautiful. Love that you can pull over to the right lane, syop get out and take pictures. The views are amazing! The waether was perfact! I will visit it again for sure."
Beautiful National Parl,"Love this park, Well kept and beautiful. We spend a couple hours driving through the ark and enjoying it"
Acadia National Park is a mini Alaska on the east coast,My wife and I were married on the edge of Bubble Pond 12 years ago escorted there in a horse drawn carriage... Just had to revist this amazing park.
Maine’s awesome treasure,"If you love incredible coastline, mountains, unspoiled scenery then you will love Acadia national Park. Take the time to do the Park Loop Road, drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain or go to the quiet part of the park and check out Schoodic Point. You cannot go wrong at this incredible national park Traffic can be crazy busy in summer and fall-be patient, be kind, look around. It’s worth it."
Off season tranquility,"Tried a visit in off season and delighted with the peacefulness and no crowds. Hikes trails with only a few others. No traffic and the place to ourselves.  The downside to that is the park had minimal services open, carriage roads closed due to wet conditions and need to protect them because of that. We found enough to do and enjoyed our visit. I love this park and will come again.  Recommend Gorham Trail. The hike and vista at the top was amazing."
The Crown Jewel of the North Atlantic,"Breathtakenly beautfiul coastline. Gorgeous lighthouses. Stunning views. Fabulous historic inn. Beautiful walkways.  Great for every level of physical endurance. A national treasure, not to be missed."
Wonderful Park....,"It's wonderful awesome park. Even though we didn't do the hiking as we were travelling with little kids, we enjoyed the park for two days. We visited in June end so water was still cold however weather was awesome and refreshing. We took the free shuttle service offered by park and did the loop, its pretty convenient and comfortable. Water is crystal clear. Definitely worth a visit, in-fact we are planning again."
A magical gem with incomparable vistas!,"Acadia National Park is glorious in spring when people and cars are few, the park loop road is empty, hiking trails have just melted, and it feels like we are the first people to have ever walked along them. The birch trees are ghostly white with buds about to burst.  The ponds and lakes are peaceful - just us and the ducks and lions.  The restaurants in Bar Harbour that are open are fabulous - they are the ones the locals frequent- like Blaze.  Put your hiking boots on and hike up from Jordan Pond House along the South Ridge Trail gradually ascending to the summit of Pemetic Mountain for stunning views along the way and even more beauty at the summit.  If you are hearty and your knees are up for it, descend the steep and scramble backside down the North Ridge trail to Bubble pond then walk the carriage road and the Jordan Pond trail back (about 4 hours total).  Or hike back down the way you came for a 2-2.5 hour round trip. Don’t bother hiking up Cadillac Mountain when you can drive it (at sunrise! It’s worth it!) and instead hike the more remote peaks without the cars and people.  Cycle the carriage roads, rent a kayak, walk the shoreline trail in town.  This is my second time in the Park - summer and spring and I will be back again to enjoy the fall colors one day."
Definitely Worth a Visit,"Mixture of teens and 50-somethings and we were all able to make the hike, albeit with a little difficulty for ther ""elder"" folk."
Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor & Winter Harbor are DREAM destinations (don't forget to breathe),"Bring your camera, and leave your watch and cell phone elsewhere...take the time to soak in all the natural beauty from on top of Cadillac Mountain on Mt. Desert Island (Bar Harbor side of Acadia National Park), or the Little Moose Island (???)...the Winter Harbor side of Acadia National Park.     Have been going up to both several times over the past decade and a half (lived in Winter Harbor in the early 70's...still have friends there).  Absolutely incredible.  Would strongly suggest you hit the 'Winter Harbor Lobster Festival' (taking Dad up there again this year), and will visit old memorable sites from early childhood...out there, the beauty doesn't change.  Go in early August, after the black flies & mosquitoes have settled down and gone.       Bar Harbor is sort of a quaint Victorian walking village with a village green surrounded by small shoppes and bistros and places to get some coffee and a pastry, then off to stroll around the town, down by the water front...it is all just incredibly relaxing.  Winter Harbor is a nature-scene painter's/photographer's delight...less of a tourist crowd.  Big 'Thanks' to the Rockefeller family for their incredible and continued support of the local towns, and to the Dixon (Dixon pencils) and Campbell (soup) families who also support the local towns.  Down East Lobstermen ROCK!!!     Bucket list this place...a bad day in Acadia National Park beats a good day anywhere else.  45th Annual Winter Harbor Lobster Festival (Aug. 2019)...here we come!  You will look forward to returning here.  Take your family and friends...this will be meaningful time spent together...experience nature here...truly and absolutely wonderful.  The drive up and down Cadillac Mtn. is incredible...take photos (and pick wild blueberries).  Go to the Jordon's Pond House Restaurant for pop-overs and local strawberry jam...what a tasteful treat.  Sample the local restaurants in / near/ around both Winter Harbor and Bar Harbor...you won't regret it...wonderful memories...even 40 years later...enjoy life in BOTH (actually...ALL...because there are SEVERAL islands, accessible by boat tours) Acadia National Parks.  Poetically beautiful!  :-D"
Sad not full open till the day we left ,"Acadia is the reason we come here. It was disappointing that the park loop road was mostly closed still due to a very hard Winter with lots of extra snow. But the parts we were able to access we love so we can't say we were disappointed in our vacation. Just disappointed that we couldn't see the whole thing this year until the day we were leaving.  Acadia has something for everyone. Ocean views, nice easy walks, medium hikes, seriously hard hikes, and sitting and enjoying the scenery. I guess something for everyone who doesn't need their mobile device for survival, because there isn't cell service in most of it."
Beutiful Park,"We visited last weekend, so there were areas still closed.  But the spots that were opened were definitely ""must stops/photo ops""."
Best Hiking Experience Ever,"My husband and I enjoy day hikes and we enjoy being challenged with different types of terrain, etc.  Acadia has so many varied options for day hikes, from easy to extremely difficult and everything in between. Views are outstanding, as well. Absolutely beautiful area. Although not that easy to get to (drove from Portland to Bar Harbor), it was well worth the trip!"
WOW! MUST VISIT THIS NATIONAL PARK,"WHO KNEW THIS PIECE OF HEAVEN existed on Earth.  Our family is now a hiking family because of Acadia National Park.  What we didn't know is that is can be a difficult park to hike, especially on a 90 degree day.  Make sure and have the right shoes on, bring plenty of water and come enjoy the beauty of this national park that overlooks the ocean.  DON'T MISS OUT"
Great!,Beautiful beaches but spoiled by the lobster pots buoys in the water.We were surprised that the park allows this...it looks like trash in the water. Disappointing.
Best of the east coast,"The east coast doesn't have the density of national parks that you can see out west, but this one is truly excellent.  Just a unique and beautiful environment.  Great range of trail difficulty with excellent views, and you are still in the midst of a nice (though slightly touristy) town."
Try to book the night sky event,"We were here in August.  Hiked the park, and also did their evening Star gazing event.  You come in the evening and basically lay on the beach and stare at the sky.  The rangers explained different planets and constellations, it was a very nice way to spend a relaxing evening."
Beautiful,What a beautiful place to visit. We came as a family for a short visit in the summer. It was easy to get around and enjoy nature. The boat tour was a lot of fun for the children.
Amazing!,We got here about 2 1/2 hours before sunset.   We stopped at some pull outs for quick pictures and then made our way to the top of Cadillac Mountain.    It was a beautiful sunset.   I wish we would have allotted more time to enjoy the park.    We spent a quick a week driving throughout the NE.   I would definitely go back to Bar Harbor/MDI (Mountain Desert Island) and spend a week.   Such a quaint town!   The people were so nice and we loved visiting.
Acadia the Beautiful,"We visited the park while everything was closed during the government shutdown, but I can't say enough good things. Acadia in winter is absolutely stunning! We had a 4WD vehicle and pretty much had the park to ourselves for the first few hours of the day. There hadn't been so much snow that we couldn't walk the closed roads and seasonly open trails, but we definitely planned ahead for the closed facilities. We tried to summit Cadillac Mountain at sunset, but this is one place the snow was too deep to handle and I wish we would have stayed at the lighthouse instead."
a visual treat,was there to show sister in law the park.it was crowded but nice.it was warm. the  view was great of the ocean. cruise ships were in view.many islands. great beaches had a beautiful day. will visit again.
Best park ever.,"Make sure to hike around Jordan Pond, or just enjoy the loop around the park.  Walk or bike the trails.  Visit Cobble cove."
Beautiful in Fall,We hiked trails and biked the carriage trails.  We were there the 3rd week in October and the leaves and scenery was beautiful.  Be prepared for wind and cold in upper elevations.
Beautiful place!,"We drove up to the top and looked out. It was really nice, but a lot of people up there. We hiked the bubbles and we weren't expecting such a hike. Jordin pond was stunning! It was peak season in fall. Just perfect!"
Absolutely beautiful!,This park is definitely one everyone should see!  It was our second time here and we loved it even more this time - even though it was extremely windy and cold at the top of Cadillac Mountain!  Would go back again in a heartbeat!
Beautiful park!,"The park area is so large, highways go through and around it. Follow the road signs, and you'll be fine. We only went by one gate, but we had an annual pass. No problem! The carriage roads are especially neat because no motorized vehicles are allowed on them. You have to watch out for bikes, but most riders were polite and announced their approach. The colors were beautiful. We were just past peak, but there was plenty of color left. We'll have to go back again. There was no way we could see it all!"
"A National Treasure, Natural Beauty!","Acadia National Park is absolutely stunning. We visited off-season without the amenities warmer weather offers. We weren't able to see any otters at Otter Point or enjoy swimming in the waters, yet we still found this park amazing. The natural landscape defies your preconceived expectations. You will find beach, rocky shoreline, mountains, islands, evergreens, wildlife, historic architecture and more.The beautiful views of the Porcupine Islands and village of Bar Harbor make you feel on top of the world. On a clear day you can capture gorgeous panoramic photos of the surrounding high points- Schoodic Peninsula, Eagle Lake, Blue Hill Mountain, the Porcupine Islands, and the harbors. It’s easy to see why this is such a popular destination for the nation’s first sunrise from October to March.Miles of ShorelineThis is an adventure you can experience over and over again without repeating the same experiences, but you will certainly develop favorites.In 1919 Acadia was the first National Park established east of the Mississippi.125 Miles of Hiking Trails45 Miles Carriage Roads@ Beaches- Saltwater & FreshwaterPet friendly areas & restricted areas- Always on a leashPark Entry $30 per VehicleVisit the link in my bio for a full review!"
Awesome plce to explore and hike in!,We explored and hiked on many trails. It is such a beautiful park and has many places to discover and see wonderful scenery. We hiked to the top of Cadillac mountain. It was exhausting and took almost 7 hours round trip but well worth the experience.
Wonderful Park,"I went to Acadia National Park via trolley from a hotel.  It is 52 steps to the Welcome Center but they gave me a hiking map and were very helpful.  I went in the fall so the foliage was gorgeous.  I walked the carriage roads (alone) and never felt threatened, even though I got lost (made a wrong turn - I have NO sense of direction) and walked 10 miles.  (I also had a map from the Welcome Center)  There is a bridge there with a waterfall that was stunning.  A great way to spend a day."
"Lovely, Great views.  Sunrise a MUST","Wonderful park, easy driving park.  Good walking park.  Sunrise visit is a MUST!!  Come early and stay late.  Make sure you get your parking pass first thing.  They are sticklers for parking passes and the no parking areas.  Tickets and fines are handed out."
Long bus ride from cruise ship,"Great way to spend a day, take a camera. and pack a lunch.  This was a cruise ship organized bus ride and a little expensive, but after we got back is was all worth it."
Absolutely beautiful and different every day.,"We really enjoyed our trip to Acadia.  The scenery was incredible and different every day depending on fog, sunshine, and sunlight.  A truly unique national treasure."
A true gem,"young or old Acadia National Park is truly a fantastic place to visit.If you like to ride a bike,hike,swim, or just look at the outstandingdifferent locations located inside this fantastic park. There are just so many different things to see and do that a one day trip just will not do it.As many times as we go to this park,we always find something that we missed the last times we went.  It can get a bit crowded at some of the venues it offers but that does not last long. You can take a great tour bus inside the park or drive yourself you will love the great sights. Make sure you bring your camera as you will want to look back at the outstanding places you visit within the park.Go up the mountains as they have roads to the top on most of the larger ones.  Eat at the great restaurant they have on the grounds and get the popovers that they are famous for. Go to the great gift shop next door. Give yourself time and do not rush. When you are finished go down to Bar Harbor village and have a great time with all the shops. If you go when the leaves are turning colors you will be thrilled at how great they look. It is a true gem and should not be missed."
Stunning Views Especially With The Fall Leaves Changing Color!,Really a worth while place to visit. Several areas to stop and check out along the way. The views were incredible as the leaves were changing and robust color was everywhere you turned. Go all the way up to Cadillac Mountain it was very enjoyable.
A national treasure,Beautiful park that I used to visit regularly. But as with all great things the crowds now make it somewhat of a hassle to enjoy. The entire area is now much like being at Disney World during the warm months and then it turns to a ghost town in the winter.
A Crown Jewel in the National Park System,"We visited Bar Harbor and Acadia NP in October and the leaves were nearing their peak. It was beautiful to drive loop road which circles the east side of the park, and hike along the shore by Sandy Beach, around Jordan Pond, and on top of Cadillac Mountain. If you enjoy hiking and being outside, try to plan 3 or more days here. Although the NP is small compared to the NPs out west, there are some beautiful hike and some amazing scenery. A few thinks to be aware of: - Like most (all?) NPs, there is an entry fee that is good for about a week.  - Part of the road is one-way, and the best way to drive through the NP is clock-wise starting at Bar Harbor and driving south toward Sandy Beach.  - Even where the road is two directions, expect the traffic to move very slow. People are crossing the road, parking and pulling out, and looking at the sights.  - Parking can be limited, so you may have to wait for a spot. Again, be patient - most people do short walks so spaces open up frequently. We would head to the hike we wanted to do most in the morning, by-passing some of the busier spots and spending several hours on a longer hike. A few great hikes are: - From Sandy Beach to Thunder Hole and back. This hike has several options. You park near Sandy Beach and can hike down to the beach. There is a hike from from the far side of the beach along the coast (a bit more rugged than the rest of the hikes in this area and more exposed along some of the cliffs.) There is also a hike that begins by the road, is fairly level and paved. From this well maintained path/sidewalk you can take many short spurs to the rocks and cliffs overlooking the water. There are dozens of amazing views and photo ops along this hike which goes on for several miles.  - Jordan Pond - There is a huge parking lot, restaurant, gift shop, etc. on the southern tip of Jordan pond. There is also a loop hike (about 2-3 miles) that circles Jordan Pond. If you hike around Jordan pond starting on the east side (going counter-clockwise), the trail is fairly level and well maintained. At about the half-way point the trail become rockier and there is some scrambling over rocks. At about the three-quarters point you have to walk on an elevated trail that is two boards wide, maybe 1-2 feet off the ground, with no handrails. Not a good spot if you have balance problems. The hike itself is beautiful with some great views. Most people hang out around the shops, so you get peace and solitude during the hike. Bubble Rock Hike - Of the 3 hikes listed this would be the most challenging. You access the parking area for Bubble rock on the road heading north from Jordan pond. The trail is up a large hill with several overlooks until you reach the top and bubble rock. It can be a decent workout, but the trail is safe and isn't exposed. Enjoy!"
Stunningly Beautiful,We managed to visit this park during peak leaf color in the fall. We were there two days in a row. The trees were very colorful. There were many places to park so you could get out and take pictures.
Best Place on Earth!!!!,"A Maine vacation would not be complete without visiting this National Treasure Park! The views are beyond belief! We always call it Little Hawaii at little cost! LOL This is such a clean and beautiful place to visit. The best time is in July for warm weather or in Sept/Oct for the leaves changing. Anytime is the best time to visit Acadia National Park. This is what the outdoor America is all about, The National Parks. Just love this place."
Acadia NP and Bar Harbor in mid August 2018,"We did a road trip from PA to Bar Harbor, Maine in August. We left PA in the morning and visited our friend in Stow, MA. We stayed overnight in Hudson.Then  the vacation began on the next day.We stopped in downtown Boston in the morning. Walked the Freedom Trail( almost 2 hours). Took Lyft back to the Visitor Center in Boston Common after our last stop at the USS Cassin Young. We drove to Salem. Watched a documentary at the Visitor Center ( paid small fee for tickets). Took the hop on hop of bus. It was great if you are short on time. We love Salem Harbor. We visited Salem Witches Trial Memorial. It was emotional. We also visited the House of Seven Gables. It was a neat experience. Stayed overnight at the Fairfield Inn in Amesbury( good breakfast). Left the hotel to around 8am. Got to Bar Harbor after 1pm. We stayed 3 nights at the Bar Harbor Inn ( ocean front room). The room is ok but the view is awesome. We had dinner at Main restaurant, the Reading Room. It was great. They had a pianist playing on the baby grand during dinner time. Lunch at the Terrace Grill was also good. We did the scenic drive, Thunder Hole, Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond....The weather was iffy the first two days: very cloudy. It was like a heavy curtain shrouded the island. We hardly saw anything. The water and the Sky were grey and looked like they were connected. Luckily, we finally saw some sun on the last day. The Harbor view was breathtaking. All the way home, we made a stop at the LL Bean flagship store in Freeport and the lighthouse in Portland. Overall, it was a great trip. My husband and my son loved all kind of lobster dishes. I love the popovers at Jordan Pond."
"Gorgeous views, nice trails",We were here on a cruise ship excursion.  We could have spent a lot more time hiking in this lovely park.
Great place to watch the sunset,"Beautiful, well kept, inexpensive. Lots to do- don’t miss thunder hole!! Fresh air, salty air, wildlife, fauna/flora... lots of photo ops. Hiking/ climbing."
Heaven on earth,Loop road & repeat. We did it 6 times because road to Mt. Cadillac was closed for the season. Scenery is stunning. Our most favorite national park in USA. Summer can be crazed so we go off season.
"""Seas"" the Day at Acadia","Undoubtedly the most beautiful scenery in the park can be found along the Ocean Path. Because of the stellar views, this is also the most crowded place to be and parking can be difficult. Plan to arrive and park in the Sand Beach parking lot before 9:00AM to guarantee an easy parking spot. After 10 or 11, you will not be able to park anywhere close until later in the day. Sand Beach parking lot includes restrooms, changing areas and water fountains for visitors. From this point, I recommend starting the morning with a hike to the top of the Beehive. The trailhead is walking distance from the Sand Beach parking. This is a strenuous but rewarding hike. Majority of the time you will be climbing up iron rungs. I actually really enjoyed this hike and didn’t think it was as challenging as all the reviews lead me to think. There will be a sign at the trailhead warning you that people have died and seriously injured themselves doing the hike. As long as you go slow and are smart and safe about it, it should be no problem. This hike is one of the most popular in the park, so starting early is highly recommended to avoid the crowds. You will not go back down the same way you go up, so once you reach the summit enjoy the ocean views and head back down the otherside of the mountain.There are options to extend the hike on the way down, so I recommend looking into those options. We ended up heading straight back to the ocean front and walked the Ocean Path. This is a walk, not a hike, but runs directly along the ocean so the views are epic. There are lots of little stops you can make along the way. Thunder Hole is awesome! The best time to go is during high tide, so later in the afternoon is best. Walk at least out to Otter Cliffs. Here you can sit on the cliffs, drink your hiking wine, and watch rock climbers tackle the rocky shore."
This was amazing!,"I went to Acadia national park a few years ago. I loved it when I first drove up to it. I went to Thunder Hole, My dads favorite place, and I went all the way up Cadillac mountain. When I got up to the top, I saw a breathtaking view! There were trails and trails among beautiful trees and I had to get a picture. I loved this experience and I totally recommend it."
Plan it our better than we did...sigh,"Acadia is a beautiful park with nice roads that cover the park. We rented a car for the day in port. Sadly I didn't check things out well enough while at the Visitor's Center. I found that a portion of the parks road system is one way and we started out on the wrong side. We could have gone back, but we would have had to retrace a lot of road we had already driven. Time didn't allow that as we had lobster on the brain.  :)"
Nature at Its Best,"Plan to spend a minimum of two days exploring the park.  The first day we took a trolley tour and got a quick overview of park highlights among which were Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Ocean Path, and Thunder Hole.  The next day we hiked the entire Ocean Path from Sand Beach to Otter Point.  The views from the path are truly breathtaking.  The road through the park starts out as a two land road with two way traffic.  It then turns into a two lane road with one way traffic.  If the parking lots are full cars are free to park in the right lane in some areas.  Be sure to follow the directions that are posted.  There is plenty of parking at Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and another lot between them."
"Even more beautiful in ""off-season""","I live near Acadia and love it, but in recent years the visitor numbers have reached new heights - making it harder to reach the mountain peaks in peace. Trailhead parking gets filled up early and the road up Cadillac Mountain gets closed off and on due to gridlock traffic. When the tide of tourists goes down after mid-October and the last cruise ship disappears from the horizon, the beauty of Acadia is unobscured again. Ahh."
Summer hiking,One of the most beautiful places we have ever visited.  Outstanding hiking and great views.  We spent 2 days hiking and we could have easily spent a few more hiking different trails.
A stunning park...,"We had 3 days here and that was a lovely amount of time to get stuck into Acadia. It is yet another stunning national park that the USA is so blessed with. With the autumn leaves - and the weather on side - there are frequent moments of just complete beauty and perfection. Had no idea that it would be as special as it is. The climb up the Beehive in the sunshine, with all of those colours and the sea below - was one of our favourite experiences ever. Highly recommend a visit to this park - especially on a sunny day in the autumn."
A quick trip up to the Cadillac Mountain,The first day was too rainy and foggy so turned back but the second day was sunny so drove all around.  Made it to the top and not many other cars.  Was able to take lots of pictures of the beautiful scenery and stopped at most of the lookout points where you could drive and park.  Beautiful!
The fall leaves were great!!,"We took a tour bus on our own instead of through the cruise ship.  We weren't disappointed.  We caught the bus right as you enter into town.  It was a cool day with intermittent rain, but still worth the trip to the park.  The bus stopped at the optimum locations to take some great pictures, especially the location with a small stream flowing through it.  The leaves were floating on the water, making for great shots and as the sun was going down, the views through the trees were amazing.  The top of the hill was windy to say the least, so take a warm coat and gloves.  Dress in layers.  Our 3rd visit to the park from Arizona and we'll be back again in a couple of years!"
So beautiful!,We booked through Norwegian Cruise Line. Their tour does NOT stop to let you take pictures or experience this magnificent park.  The bus only stopped at a nature center to see native plants. The rest of the tour was a drive by only. Other tours were stopped along the way to see the gorgeous shoreline and scenery. We also had the lobster bake with this tour and that part was great. Make sure you book with a company that will allow you to experience this wonderful park.
Fog bound,An interesting park with Mt Cadillac completely fog bound. Jordan Pond worth the walk and buggy/wagon ride is a great way to see the countryside.
Beautiful place to visit,"There are so many different sites to visit there, it would be impossible to list them all.  I do photography and didn’t have enough time to see everything I wanted to."
DO NOT MISS this Park!,"My friend (who has mobility issues) and I were on vacation in Portland, ME and decided to make the 3 hour drive to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park.  We debated if it was worth the drive and/or if she could enjoy it with a limited ability to walk but IT WAS SO WORTH IT.  Every single pull over and overlook is simply breathtaking.  We bought our passes at the National Park information building, which made entry very easy.  There are a couple different options once in the park - a long complete loop at a partial loop.  We took the partial look which still took several hours. I was able to walk down some of the trails to get great photos, but even my friend was able to enjoy the park from the overlooks which didn't require much walking.  What she could not see, I showed her in photos.  I'd love to return and do some hiking.  The day we were there was cool, cloudy and drizzling at times, but it was STILL awesome.  DO NOT MISS THIS PARK if you are anywhere in the area."
Natural Beauty ,"Such a stunningly beautiful national park! We took an Oli’s Trolly tour through the park, which was fabulous, but we later found out there is a free hop on hop off shuttle that goes around the park as well. You must see Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, and Thunder Hole. There is so much amazing hiking all over the park too!"
Stunning,"My friends and I planned our trip so we would be able to see the leaves changing colors and everything happened to work out perfectly. We center most of our vacations around a national park and thought we would never find one that made us feel like Glacier National Park did, well, Acadia did just that. It has has stunning views from every angle. We really enjoyed the ease of getting through the park and the many pull offs and places to explore. Going during a less crowded season made us feel like we were solo in some places which was wonderful. We stayed at a vacation rental near Seal Cove and spent everyday exploring and each night stargazing. Big hits were Lulu's Lobster Boat in Bar Harbor, Eagle and Echo lakes, Otter Point, Sand Beach, and Cadillac Mountain."
Oh the beauty....,"We spent 3 days at this gem of a national park and despite SO much rain and chilly temperatures, we absolutely want to come back.  We stayed at Blackwoods campground which was dry camping.  There were paid showers just outside the campground which were adequate. The campsites were awesome (a little difficult to get our 30 foot trailer in) and the bathrooms had grey water sinks, electrical outlets and flushing toilets.  We could hike from our campsite to the Atlantic Ocean with incredible views.  We did a 3 hour bus tour of Mount Desert Island which I highly recommend for an overview.  The park rangers gave us recommendations for great hikes near Long Pond Road and to the Bass Harbor lighthouse.  Bar Harbor is crowded but fun to explore!"
Beautiful,"Wonderful National Park. The park is well maintain especially considering the amount of visitors. We really enjoyed hiking the different trails in the park, and the shuttle was very useful."
A true gem!,"We so enjoyed our trip to this beautiful national park. We went in October so we had cool temps and cheerful fall foliage waiting for us when we arrived in Bangor. The weather was a bit rainy and overcast most of the time but, in my opinion, that only added to the ethereal, mystical feel of the ferns, trails, mosses, mushrooms, forests and coastline. And when the sun came out on our last day, you felt as if you had a whole new park to explore. So worth the time. Come to this beautiful park, you will love it!"
It is one of the most beautiful places I have been.  I loved hiking and biking there.,It is one of the most beautiful places I have been.  I loved hiking and biking there and you have to go to the Jordan Pond House and have a Popover!
Not Enough Time To Explore It All,"On a map the park looks small and compact. In truth there are many areas that we were not even able to explore because of its size. We were fortunate, despite being there in the busy season, to easily find a spot to park on Cadillac Mountain to enjoy the views. My only regret is not having planned enough time to explore the park more thoroughly."
Stunning views,Such a beautiful place! Drive up Catalac mountain for the most stunning views! You won’t want to miss this!!
Beautiful hiking and scenery,Jordan Pond was great for scenery and hiking. I wish we had come a few weeks later for the fall foilage . Definitely worth the trip.
Awesome Acadia!,"Fall is a gorgeous time to visit! Weather is crazy, we had beautiful sunny weather then driving cold rain all in same day. So many places in the park to explore. The carriage trails are wonderful. The bridges beautiful works of art. Traditional trails we tried were a bit more challenging with the wet weather and not marked real well. We even bought the trail map and we messed up a couple of times. But all good."
Acadia - Just WOW!,Coming to Acadia National Park in the Fall has been the best vacation I have ever taken...and I have been to some amazing destinations. What made it the best was how relaxing it was to just drive and/or walk around surrounded by such incredible beauty. The park was so easy to navigate; far easier than any of the travel guides I read made me believe. I am so happy we visited. I am already trying to decide when we will go back.
Best views,The most amazing National Park I’ve ever been to. A wonderful combination of the ocean and the mountains. Many trails with technical routes or an easy stroll. I highly recommend it on your bucket list!
Acadia,We wished we had more time to spend there. It was end of season and the leaves were beautiful. The 27 mile park loop was beautiful.The history with all the carriage roads and how the park was founded is very interesting. Wonderful 360 degree views from the mountain top.  What a picture perfect moment.
Must See National Park on East Coast,"Beautiful National Park in Maine.  There is something for everyone!  Hiking trails, carriage rides, wildlife, scenic vistas, boating, camping, rock climbing, etc.  Park does get crowded and the road to Cadillac Mountain may be closed due to high traffic volume.  First time visitors hire a guide to get the most from your visit."
FaF@ll in the park,Went on a Canada New England cruise  Port stop and did this bus tour excursionSeen the water spouts. View from Cadillac mountain. Even on a rainy day it was a good tour
"Spectacular, Awesome","A very special National Par with awe inspiring scenery.  The cliffs, the forest and the views shouldn’t be missed.  Take a tour by bus or drive it on your own.  A place we will visit again and again.  We can’t wait until next year to visit the park again.  Did I write a return visit!  We have traveled the USA visiting many National Parks but this one demands a return.  It’s that great.  Don’t miss it."
natural beauty,"This place is beautiful.  I even went on a rainy day and the views were amazing.  I would recommend going while the leaves are changing color, late September/ early October.  I was there at the end of October and would have loved to see it then.  We took a bus trip up to the top of the mountain with a guided tour, It was interesting to learn all the history of the mountain and Island of Bar Harbor.  There where many trail to hike if that is your thing."
Beautiful!,"I don't think you can go wrong with National Parks, but Acadia exceeded my expectations. Gorgeous park and very accessible. Take the time to do some hiking (we did the south coast trail and Jordan Pond). And make a point of catching sunrise on top of Mt Cadillac, it was awesome."
A Great Place to Hike,Acadia National Park is a great place to hike and experience the wilderness and the ocean. There are numerous scenic places to take photographs or simply marvel at nature. It's a wonderful place for family or simply to explore on your own.
Definitley bucket list worthy,Have not been to many national parks but Arcadia changes your perspective on our country and its beauty that should not be missed.Cadillac Mountain is spectacular
Lovely views,"The colors of the fall, the views of the sea from the top of the mountain and more, make Acadia National Park a lovely way to spend a day."
lovely day spent in park,"wonderful drive through park and lovely walks to suit all abilities, take the buses from village green and plan your route through the park, getting off one bus short walks and hopping on next to see as much or as little of the park that suits your time. you will need to buy a Park pass to enter"
Great landscape sea shores ...,"I went there in autumn , the best season according to me not a lot of people .This allowed to access to best point of views . Please just note that due to a big fire occured in 1940 squerels never came back to the park ! Rangers try to populate again we have to wait to see them again ."
Beautiful Fall Colors,"Although we missed ""peak"" season for Fall colors, there was still plenty of color to be seen. Beautiful National Park with different tyyes of hiking."
Great walking opportunities!,Spent the morning walking on carriage trail to Hadlock Falls.   Beautiful scenery with easy walk.   Some up hill and downhill but very level ground.   The falls were stunning as the water flowed.   Very quiet and such a great walk.    I only walked three miles but you could make walk as long as you wanted.   Plenty of parking this time of year.
A National Park you must visit,"We had such a great time driving on all the roads in the park and all over Desert Island. From the top of Cadillac Mountain to the Bass Harbor Lighthouse, the views were absolutely stunning. We were not able to do much hiking on all the trails available, next visit for sure."
Great hiking!,Maine is beautiful  and hiking Acadia is simply gorgeous! From the majestic Otter Cliffs to Jordan Pond. We can't wait to go again!
Beautiful foliage views,"Beautiful foliage views.  Recommend hiking the bee hive and driving up Cadillac mountain.  Spent hours driving to the lighthouse at the bottom of one of the peninsulas and was underwhelming for the time taken to get there.  I wish Acadia had better signage of the trails, one of the worst signage in national parks I have visited.  Beautiful views though."
Acadia is incredible!,"We spent a week visiting Acadia, we chose mid September to avoid the crowds and were so pleased. Although the weekend is still busy, you could find parking most of the times and the hikes were not crowded. Our favorite was the Beehive. It was challenging but well worth the views! We also took a couple boat excursions, one at sunset and loved being on the water. We also took a wagon ride on the carriage roads and learned about the history of the park. The color was only about 25% at that time so we definitely will go back in October next time. Overall it was a fantastic trip. We got a nonstop flight from Chicago to Bangor. We stayed at a wonderful resort in Bar Harbor and ate lots of lobster and other wonderful seafood! Truly a fabulous trip!"
Beauty surrounds you!,A second visit to Acadia didn't disappoint although the fall colors weren't as vibrant as our first visit several years ago.  The vistas range from ocean to forests to lakes.  There are many hiking trails and a great sunrise view from Cadillac Mountain.
Have Always Wanted to Visit and it did NOT Disappoint!,"I have wanted to see this park since I was a little girl and never dreamed I would get anywhere near it. We had one day to see what we could see and I thank other reviewers who shared what they did in a day.  We visited the end of October so many of the shops and stops along the way were closed or only parts of things open. There were a lot of people, but not so many that we couldn't get around easily.  We first went to the main visitor's center and stamped our book, picked up a map, bought our patch and Christmas ornament - all things you have to do when you visit a national park! Then we headed down right way to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. We misread the map and ended up on a loop that circled around - we only went around twice before we figured that out or we maybe would be still on it! So watch that map there!  We first walked around to the right of the lighthouse and it is not the iconic view we were expecting.  The path to the left is the one you want and it leads to a steep set of stairs that leads down to boulders on the shore.  You climb over boulder after boulder after boulder to get as close as you can to the water and look up and there is the view of the lighthouse everyone wants!  I am 60 and had hurt my knee before the trip, but had waited to long not to try it. So down the stairs I went, and out over the boulders (with help ha ha) and was so glad I was able to see it.  An immature loon popped up out of nowhere and showed off a bit, then we saw this ""floating head"" and it was attached I am sure to the body of a seal, but all we saw was the face looking at us. Very cute and it disappeared too soon down in to the ocean.  After this we headed up to the main loop, stopped at Jordan Pond and then made another long stop at the top of Cadillac Mountain.  There are no words to describe the view. It was a little cold, but we all had coats with hoods and were fine. There are a lot of places to walk around and lots of places to take pictures. If you only have one day like we did, we felt we had gotten a really good idea of what the park is like by seeing the lighthouse and Cadillac Mountain.  The colors this time of year were amazing as well.  Can't wait to go back and spend more time!"
Wonderful Park even on a chilly Autumn day,"I spent three hours in Acadia National Park on a small tour bus.  Even though we stopped very often for photographs, I wish I could have spent all day in the park exploring.  There is so much to see, so many trails to walk and so much history to absorb.  I won't repeat many kudos of prior reviewers, but I do suggest you read their reviews.  Even though Acadia may be small in area, You will not be disappointed in this National Park.  Schedule enough time and enjoy."
Amazing National Park,This is certainly not a large National Park but is one of my favorites.  The trails are incredibly well kept and the drives are constantly scenic.  The drawback is the volume of visitors during  our visit in September we bypassed several sites due to lack of parking.  There is a shuttle that runs in the park and it is worth utilizing to miss the parking crowds.  Wonderful park!
Just as lovely the second time around!,Put this on your bucket list for sure! 10 years ago we visited in the early spring and it was awe inspiring. We just did a second trip and the fall colors were beautiful! Even in the drizzling rain it was a beautiful drive with breathtaking scenery.
Awesome Acadia,"We truly enjoyed our bus tour of Acadia National Park. This is an amazing area and our guide, P.J. was fantastic. She related history, information and even some great stories that kept us entertained and interested. We had a Lobster Bake at the beautiful Country Club at the end of the tour and the whole meal was handled efficiently and with true skill - the tour made me want to come back here and stay for about a month - or two!"
A BRILLIANT DRIVE WITH STUNING VIEWS AT EVERY TURN,Acadia National Park is a fairly small area but it has attractive views and vistas everywhere you look. The pass you pay for allows repeated visits but a couple of days is enough to see everything properly. Unmissable!
Jordans Pond,We were on an excursion going through one section of Acadia National Park - only had a few minutes at Jordans Pond...but what foliage it made my trip worthwhile i wanted foliage and i found it 12.october.2018. i wish i had more time there but no matter.
One of the beauties of the USA!,There is a reason why Acadia National Park is the second most visited national park in the USA.  The views are spectular.  Viewing sun rise from atop the Mountop is wonderful -- but dress warmly -- it will be colder than you think!
Wonderful...don't miss,Visiting Bar Harbour area.Return visited this wonderful national after 20 years.Just a great place with wonderful vistas and a full range of out door activities for the whole family and every fitness level.One of the great places to visit in North America!
Gorgeous!,"We loved Acadia.  Gorgeous views.  The weather could change quickly--fog and mist one minute, the next sunny and warm!"
Magnificent Scenery in an Understated Park,Beautiful setting for all outdoor activities.  Classic Carriage Roads and well-maintained hiking paths throughout the Park.  Incredible history of the creation of the Park and its numerous trails.  Granite steps and roadside blocks of granite attest to the effort put into the creation of this beautiful destination.
Great view from atop Cadillac Mountain,"This is one of the few national parks in the east, and is definitely worth a visit.  The drive around the park takes about 2 to 3 hours with stops at numerous scenic overlooks.  Traffic was heavy going up to Cadillac Mountain, but well worth doing for the 360 degrees views.  We gave a ride down the mountain to a couple who had hiked up.  They said it took two hours."
Auto-touring in Acadia National Park,"Allow a few days at least to soak in the scenery and atmosphere of Acadia National Park in ME.  Its views everywhere are simply breath-taking.  From mountains to rocky shores to interior ponds and preserved forests, it offers a wide variety of environments.  Also in season, there are horse-drawn buggies along carriage roads.  It also has an interesting history which you can look up."
Jewel in Maine,"First off, we went with a 25 year old, not a teen and we are complete nature lovers. The park can take many days to actually go through so if you have limited time, the must sees are Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach. We could have spent hours just sitting on rocks and watching the waves crashing, it was that awesome. But read about the park in other reviews. I just want to give some money and time saving tips.We stayed in Lincolnville and drove 2.5 hours to the park. The reason was Bar Harbor is a very touristy place and the hotels are not that great and overpriced. Also the Atlantic Highway drive from Camden/ Linconville is breathtaking and since we went in the fall, it was present in all its glory! It was definitely time well spent. Lincolnville has some beautiful B&Bs, with phenomenal views, very quiet and serene. We enjoyed our sunrises there and some delicious breakfast at Dot’s (a quaint bakery with delish homemade goodies). The best way to see the park is to drive in to Bar Harbor and take advantage of the free parking at the end of Main Street. Then walk back to the square in MainStreet (10 min) and take buses to the park. The LLBean buses take you to different spots in the park and they are free of charge. They only run until the Sunday of Columbus Day weekend- important! You can use the buses to go to and from various stops inside the park and eventually back to Bar Harbor Square. No headache of payment of $30 for parking inside the park, nor looking for parking which is hard to do. Bar Harbor itself is a lovely town with all the activity concentrated on Main Street; usual souvenir stores, restaurants, and speciality stores. We didn’t eat there as we had gotten custom made sandwiches from Dot’s and had a picnic in the park. Best to take food and drinks and water with you as it’s not easily available all over the place. Wet wipes and Kleenex as well some very basic first aid is a good idea to carry along in your backpack. Sneakers are the way to go as there are several trekking and hiking trails and it’s mountainous and rocky in some parts. Gets cool, so a jacket is always a good idea."
Fall Foliage,"We hit the highlights of Jordan's Pond and Cadiallac Mountain. Would love to have more time on our next visit. It was a great trip with many beautiful sites to walk, bike, etc."
Fall Beauty,"Beauty beyond words...... the fall colors were still peaking. We drove the entire park loop road and made stops as we went along. The colors are different throughout the park. We stopped at Sand Beach and walked the 1.5 mile path each way to Thunder Hole. Not the best path to chose as most of it ran along the road, my fault for not knowing. We arrived at the Jordan Pond House expecting to try the popovers, it was closed for the season. Nowhere on the website did it mention this. Glad we had some snacks and drinks with us. Went to the top of Cadillac mountain, great views."
Beautiful,"We are avid National Park travelers and hikers, having visited 34 now. Acadia was beautiful, especially in October. We hiked to the top of Mt. Champlain. Not at all my favorite trail, with boulder climbing and rounded off large rocks at the beginning and end. But, the views at the top were beautiful and the trail was not at all crowded even on a Saturday.Great national park...a must see in New England."
Breathtaking,"We had a senior pass to enter the park, so that saved us a great deal of time. Well worth buying the pass. Our first stop was Cadillac Mountain, beautiful the views never ending. Then the next couple days we did the Loop, stopped at sights along the way. You have to see this place first hand, pictures don't so it justice."
Amazing fall colors,"Amazing place to visit and should be on your bucket list.  It was chilly while we were there, but we were able to lots of walks. So beautiful, a must do! Fall colors were picture perfect!"
Gorgeous Location!,"Absolutely gorgeous park! We were there in early October and the fall colors were turning! The park was less crowded than the summer but beware of the cruise ships in Bay Harbor...they fill up the park, tours and restaurants quickly!"
Early October,We visited for a long weekend in early October. The loop drive was nice. Great views. Sunset at Cadillac Mountain was gorgeous.
Just beautiful!,Plenty of hiking trails with spectacular views.  We visited in late October when the park was less crowded so we only encountered a few other hikers on the trails we visited.
Great Park,Beautiful park!  Fall is the best time as there are less people and the fall colors are truly amazing.  The park staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.
Gorgeous with the color changes,"We went during the color change:  breathtaking!  We were a little disappointed that we couldn't drive up Cadillac Mountain because of snow and ice, but we enjoyed driving through the park."
Wonderful for a non-hiker,"Neither my husband nor I are in rigorous hiking shape, but the 27-mile park loop is perfect. You can get most scenic views just a few steps from your car; others require a short, mostly non-strenuous walk. I think everything is pretty wheelchair-accessible, too.  It's a wonderful way to see the fall color and the scenic surroundings without having to strap on a backpack. The admission is reasonable and the gift shop has a lot of cool stuff. (There are also smaller gift shops at the main attractions.)"
Best loop road trip,"The Acadia  loop is one of the best loops in the mountain's lap. There are about 6 stops in the complete loop so you would want to hit the road early in the day so you can enjoy the views and be back by evening. Some people treck, some cycle - I preferred car (since I am a bit lazy to walk or cycle), but it's totally worth it. The place is really beautiful during falls."
RV’s aren’t allowed up Cadillac Mtn but don’t hesitate to drive the other areas,Just an advance planning tip. Cadillac Mtn road doesn’t allow RV’s. However driving the other scenic roads in or around the park will be well rewarded.  Our timing was excellent this year with an explosion of fall color and a beautiful sunny day.
Plenty of things to see and do,"This National Park is great for those who love the outdoors.  There is plenty of activities to do.  Do not miss Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, and hike the many trails throughout the park.  Hike both the Ocean Path Trail and Jordon Pond Trail.  Totally different, but equally beautiful in their own rights."
America's Premier National Park,"Acadia National Park is our favorite vacation destination.  We usually go up in fall, to enjoy the spectacular foliage.  Now that Bar Harbor is a regular stop for cruise ships, the town and the park’s main attractions can get very busy, but Acadia is so big it doesn’t take much effort to escape the “madding crowd.”  Cadillac Mountain, Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and the Park Loop Road will probably require patience, but a hike up Gorham Mountain or around Great Head will get you in away from the tour buses and in touch with nature. I recommend starting at the Hull’s Cove Visitor Center to buy your park pass ($30 per vehicle, good for seven days), check the weather and tide forecast, and see what ranger-led programs might interest you.  I also highly recommend the Acadia National Park (waterproof) Trail Map, which shows distances and contour lines, invaluable for planning a hike, a bike ride along the gravel carriage roads, or a cross-country run.    In addition to road and trail maps, it also provides a brief description of the most-popular hikes. Time and weather permitting, a drive around the 27-mile Park Loop Road would be a good sampler of what Acadia has to offer, after which you can better plan how to spend your time—on the rocky coast, which can be spectacular if the weather and tides are in your favor, or hiking up one of the granite mountains for a view over the Atlantic, or enjoying a ramble along a brook through a spruce and balsam pine forest.  We bike the Park Loop Road at least once each trip.  After several years of starting from the Hull’s Cove parking lot, we hit on the idea of parking at Jordan Pond (in the overflow lot) in the morning, then finishing our ride with popovers and lobster stew at the Jordan Pond restaurant.  This lets you get the long climb up from Jordan’s Pond out of the way while you are still fresh, and avoids the traffic between the Hull’s Cove Entrance and Eagle Lake Road.We travel with our two dogs, which are allowed on the carriage roads and most of the hiking trails (Beehive trail, which traverses a series of ledges with the aid of iron rungs drilled into vertical granite walls, is not dog-friendly).  Sand Beach and Echo Beach are off-limits to dogs during peak season (May-September)."
Gorgeous National Park,"This is a must see in life. Beautiful park with lots of scenic routes, photo ops, and things to do/see. Stop by the visitors center first thing to get info on area attractions. Acadia spans a large area and you'll want to see all areas. The park on Mount Dessert Island has lots of attractions, but can be very crowded. Don't forget to check out the Schoodic Peninsula, which has less crowding and gorgeous views. We drove all the area roads, stopped in the little towns and enjoyed all things Acadia. You won't want to miss it!"
Spectacular Beauty,Our visit matched everything I always heard about Acadia. We  parked our car at Sand Beach and walked the Ocean Path Trail. Spectacular views. Many pictures. We got there early on a late September Saturday so the trail was not too crowded. However at some points like Thunder Hole there would be bus loads (2 or 3) letting off passengers to view so we walked ahead and stopped on our way back to Sand Beach. Also later as we planned to drive up to Cadillac Mountain the Park Rangers had it barricaded and were waving you on with words to come back in an hour. This was about noon time so not at crowded times for sunrise or sunset on Cadillac. Later back in Bar Harbor we heard that when big cruise ships port and send bus loads of people out to Acadia they shut down Cadillac Mountain when bus loads up there. A beautiful national park with much to see.
BEAUTIFUL!!!,"If you are visiting Bar Harbor, Acadia National Park is a place to go. Cadillac Mountain has the best view. Gorgeous!"
Beautiful nature,Loved this place.  Rented an e-bike and pedalled around all day.  Walked the carriage roads.  From coast to park to pines it is awesome!!
Beautiful and Breathe Taking,"We were there the third week of October.  The Fall Foliage was at its peak and just beautiful.  Temperature was cool and windy.  This is an all day trip since there is so much to see and do.  There are several hiking trails, pull off areas to view Bay and sights in Park.  The cost is $30.00 for a weeks pass you pay at the visitors center.  You will pass through a check point so make sure your pass is in window.  Just an incredible place to see and visit."
Beautiful,"Breath Taking Beautiful. Fall Foliage was amazing. Loved the different points where you could see the water, Especially at Cadillac Mountain Top. Walked on the Beach."
Scenic,In the fall you cannot beat the color and the view as you drive around the park.  Take a drive to the top of Mt Cadillac for a scenic view.  The drive on the road around the ocean with the rock cliffs are breathtaking
"Yes, it should be on your bucket list",Woody's tour picked us up in town and gave us the most wonderful and informative private excursion through the Park for the same price the four of us would have had to pay to ride a bus through the cruise ship arrangements.  The vistas throughout the park are amazing and we were treated to trees at the peak of color.  Even the wild blueberry bushes put on a show for us. Woody was very knowledgeable about the history of the park and I was fascinated to learn how the fire of 1947 affected the growth we were looking at today.
A Jewel,So much beauty it takes your breath away!. Park Loop Road is a good place to start. To really see the park you have to hike the mountains and ride the bike trails. You can see so many more things doing those activities than you can by just riding through. Stunning views of the ocean - the sound - the lakes - the beach and so much more. My favorite place in the world.
Amazing ,Acadia national Park in the fall is one of the most beautiful places in the world.To travel around and see the places in the park is amazing this place you never want to leave it is so relaxing so beautiful and so many hikes to take
Fall beauty,We went mid-October for the fall colors and the lobster. We were not disappointed. It was all wonderful.
Wonderful late October visit!,"I love this place...visited as a child from out of state, and loved it and Maine so much I moved here 20 years ago.  Hadn't been in several years and took a friend who has never been to Maine.  It was later than we planned to visit and I was a bit concerned it would be, grey, too cold and the leave gone!  Cruise ships and bus tours still visiting!  But, a totally manageable amount.  And it did not disappoint at all!!!!!The weather was typical Maine...all over the place and we revisited several first day spots on the second day and that was wonderful...different sun location for totally different colors and light!  Tides were different so one area was really different from the next and from the day before.  Sooooo much to do, and many places to sit and revel in the water, sounds and beauty!!!!!Sand Beach, the Rock Beach at the tip of the Park loop...Thunder Hole was more impressive than I have seen in the last several visits due to more wave activity and it was wonderful!  And the top of Cadillac...the drive up is awesome....the wind and trails, views and geological science behind it...love....so windy and cold our first day our eyes teared and froze a bit...and it was great!  Next day, the clouds, sun, blue skies, ocean, reds of the low bushes and green growth on the rocks...just great!!!!!!!  We are two, older friends travelling together, we felt safe and comfortable throughout the park.  We are a bit on the out of shape side and there are tons of options for us...even if the steps can be a bit hit for us shorter folks:)  It is a wonderful place that always leaves me wanting to return."
On top of the world!,"We live in a rural place but this is in it's own category. There are hikes for all levels but if you don't want to hike, you can take the park loop road to the top!"
Fantastic day in the park,"Our catamaran trip we booked on the Holland America cruise was cancelled the day we arrived in Bar Harbor.  We were so disappointed and decided to walk into the town.  On our way we were approached by tour guides offering $100/hour van trips into the park but we decided not to spend that much on a tour, so we continued on into town and stopped for coffee.Imagine our surprise to find out for a senior pass into the park costing $20, we could ride a free bus that looped throughout the park with stops at all the major lots.  We were thrilled, were fortunate to have a beautiful sunny day and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, including a splurge lunch at Jordan Pond.  We were very annoyed by the tour guides at the dock who were trying to sell us something so overpriced when there was such a reasonable local option available..For further information, ask where the National Parks information office is, it is a short walk from the docks.  The busses leave every twenty minutes and will take you to all the major stops in the park.  Thank you to the US Government and the State of Maine for funding this!!!"
AWESOME,A bit cloudy today but still Absolutely Beautiful.  You can spend a whole day enjoying all the spectacular view and trails.  A definite must!!!!!
One of my favorite places I have ever visited!!,My husband and I travelled to Bar Harbor to visit Acadia National Park. It was truly one of the most magnificent places I have ever seen. You simply have to go!!!
A true treasure,"We visited Acadia National Park the first week of October, expecting the leaves to be gorgeous, but we were silly enough to not realize that thousands of other people would feel the same way.  It was quite crowded and parking was difficult to impossible at times.  We had a 20 minute wait to get to the top of Cadillac mountain in our car, but as we were coming down there was no line.  All that said, we truly enjoyed the park, the beautiful fall foliage, its views and hiking and next time we go, we will consider the time of year and potential crowds."
Beautiful,"Smallest national park in the US but the one of the most beautiful!  Make a point to get there, Jordon Pond, Cadillac Mountain - so picturesque especially in the fall."
Amazingly Beautiful in Fall,Beautiful in full foliage. Huge and big park with beautiful fall colors.Beach access and Great views of Sun Rise.
So Beautiful!,Acadia is so beautiful. Pictures cannot do it justice! Jordan's Pond and Cadillac Mountain views are not to be missed. Can't wait to go back!
A gorgeous park,"Out visit was In October. The leaves were still colorful, and crowds a bit smaller than summer. To get anfeel for the the park we took the loop drive. Ther is one stunning view afte another. We stopped of tonget our and enjoy the scenery and grab pictures. This definitely a must do. We saved the drive to Cadillac mountain until the end. The views over the whole area are wonderful.  Though was a bit windy and temps were a few degree above freezing."
Ride or Walk the many miles of trails,"The park is outstanding with a lot to do, biking, hiking, walking. Beautiful landscapes. Cadillac Mtn views."
"beautifel, beyond description",Our second visit was just as enthralling as our first. The magnificent views and hikes are a tribute to the foresight of T Roosevelt's vision and love of nature. Of course the highlight is always Cadillac Mountain.
Beautiful park,Very well maintained. We went just after the maples has reached there peak but it was still beautiful.  We stopped three places inside the park on our tour. Just a lovely place on God’s earth.
Beautiful place!  Don't miss it!,"You should take the time to drive/ hike through Acadia National Park.  It really is beautiful!  For us, the autumn foliage color changes were at peak and absolutely wonderful!"
Fantastic scenery,We parked at the visitor centre & used the free bus around the park.  Afterwards we drove up Cadillac Mountain (as the bus can't get up there) for fantastic views.
Biking delight.  If you are able YOU MUST bike the carriage trail,Acadia National Park is perfectly set up to bike!  There are trails of all different lengths and abilities.  Although the trails are well marked and well surfaced they don't tell you how easy or difficult they are and the map we had didn't either.  We got off a pushed when up hill was too much.  So worth it.  Beautiful outdoor adventure.
Breathtaking.....,This was one of the most breathtaking mountains or parks that we have been to.  The views of the harbor and the foliage was just beautiful.  So very glad that we did not miss this opportunity to visit this amazing park.
Fantastic Beauty,Don’t miss visiting Acadia National Park and Cadillac Mountain. Very scenic and beautiful views. Cadillac Mountain has a small gift shop and rest rooms.
Breathtaking Must Do,"We went to Acadia to celebrate our 10th anniversary.  It was already a special, meaningful time, and Acadia only added to the experience.We saw Acadia at peak color - nature's fireworks in hues of red, gold, and orange interspersed with the green of the pines.  The vegetation is lush, but with only 20 inches or less of soil, there is an abundance of granite rock formations to view as well and vistas off to the Atlantic.  We saw a variety of weather from sunny and hot on the first day to pouring rain the second.  Even a rain day made for special times:  waterfalls falling over cliff ledges that were not there the day before, amping up the volume at Thunder Hole, no lines at Cadillac Mountain.  We just grabbed a poncho and made do.We found the Jordan Pond Trail and Jordan Pond Stream Path to be must do hikes.  Both are fairly easy, though the former has a bit of a bouldering section in the middle.  We also challenged ourselves to find as many carriage road bridges as time allowed, including hiking those in the Upper Hadlock Pond area.  That hike was a bit more challenging with steeper ascents/descents.  All beautiful hikes.In reviewing some of the lower ranked reviews, I wanted to comment on a few things.  First, one must note that Acadia is the largest national park east of the Mississippi.  Given that...""It's really expensive for a national park.""  Actually, we found that a visit to Acadia can be done fairly moderately.  There is a variety of privately owned lodging and dining options just outside of the park (in Bar Harbor and elsewhere on the island), unlike other parks like Yellowstone or Yosemite, where the park concessionaire is your only option.  Here, you get a large say in how much you want to spend.""It's overcrowded.""  I don't even really know how to respond to that other than to ask whether the individual has ever been to a national park?  Yes, you can get into a traffic jam here and there.  As you can with bison-jams in Yellowstone.  Or trying to find a parking spot at the Lodge at Yosemite Falls (or whatever it is called now).  National parks are tourist destinations.  Have some patience, take in the fresh air and beautiful sites, and just chill already.""The gift shop at the Visitor's Center had nothing.""  There are three other gift shops in the park - Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole, Cadillac Mountain.  And dozens of shops in Bar Harbor."
Extremely beatiful,"Acadia is an amazing national park. The internal/mountain trails are nice, challenging and offer some amazing views, and the coast is just stunning.."
Beautiful park - worth your visit,"Acadia is wonderful and Bar Harbor is worth a visit, just not when the cruises arrive. The crowds detract from a wonderful seaside village and the park is great for driving or hiking. Stop, take pictures and enjoy the scenery."
Great way to spend a day,"What a wonderful place for those who enjoy nature,scenery,etc. Hiking trails that take you along the coastline with great views. You can drive in yourself or take buses from Bar Harbor Commons. So many photo opps."
"Acadia National Park - Bar Harbor, Maine","Acadia truly is a national treasure.  You can visit Thunder Hole which is an awesome and unique experience.  Visit Cadillac Mountain where the scenery in every direction you look is spectacular.  There are lots of hiking trails from easy to the more difficult, there are horse drawn carriage rides, and the lakes and ponds are beautiful.  You can also bicycle around the park if you wish.  There is lots to do and see there and most hotels will pack you a picnic lunch if you want to spend the day at the park."
Beautiful fall day.,What a fantastic place to visit. Scenery is right up there with the best of the best for National Parks. Did the park loop making most stops. View from Cadillac Mt. is not to be missed. Jordan's Pond was beautiful. Did some walking on carriage roads up to Watrerfall Bridge. Can't wait to visit again someday!
Beautiful National Park,"We enjoy visiting our Nation's parks.  Acadia National Park is now our newest favorite.  It is a very popular park, so plan your time accordingly.  It may take a little bit to drive up Cadillac Mountain as the park tries to control the traffic flow there."
Beautiful in the Fall,Visited during a tour of New England. Amazing views from the top of the mountain.  Well worth a visit.
Trails for all sizes!,The trails are amazing! Make sure to look at the trail maps they are very helpful when deciding which trails to walk.
Amazing views!,This is an amazing park!  The views are spectacular and there is just no better way to see Bar Harbor than from the top of Cadillac Mountain.  Just beautiful - especially in the Fall.
Beautiful Park,We enjoyed getting to see the Park in the fall.  Everything was very well maintained.  The park was full and parking was limited in some places.
"Wonderful, even in the rain","We came for the fall foliage and the state of Maine publishes a week-by-week indicator of where the trees had gotten to peak so we knew we would see beautiful colors.  Unfortunately, the weather was not very conducive to staying outside.  It was rainy and cooler than I would have expected for mid-October -- but then, I live in Florida, so I am sensitive to cold.  Still the sights in the park were well worth getting drizzled on."
Beautiful scenery,"Loved the ocean views, the carriage roads are awesome for walking, hiking or bike riding. Even better are the carriage rides but book early they sell out. Lunch or late afternoon snack at Jordan Pond House is great, the popovers are a must!"
let the driving be with the tour guide,we had plenty of photo shots on this drive the driver was very knowly of every thing about this tour
Beautiful Vistas but Parking Is a Premium,"Visited Acadia in the Fall and the trees there and across the island were stunning. The park is very wild and beautiful, but compared to many other National Parks we have visited, we found it to be poorly marked and lacking ample parking. A drive up to the main attraction, the views from Mount Cadillac, was not difficult, though the road was winding. Reaching the top, however, we had to inch forward in traffic for 10-15 minutes to get a parking place. When we left the line was even longer. As we continued around the 20 mile loop road, we could not find a parking place at Jordan Pond, and never did find two other attraction spots because we did not see turnoff signs. Having said that, it is the second most visited park and worth your visit."
Beautiful National Park,"There are many ways to see the park. You can drive, take a tour bus, ride an 'on and off' trolley, or hike. There are many places to park and enjoy the view or walk down a path to get several different views. If you are a photographer like I am, you will spend many hours with your camera. The view from Cadillac Mountain gets better and better as you go up. They say that the sunrise is beautiful at the peak but you have to get there early if you want a parking space. I was told that it is the first place that you can see the sun rise in the United States due to it's location and elevation."
Acadia National Park in the Fall,"Acadia National Park has something for everyone. Breathtaking scenery, scrumptious seafood, tantalizing hikes and most of all it has peacefulness. It’s an amazing place with Nature all around. The sea, the mountains, the cliffs! What’s not to like? Well there is Bar Harbor with a lot of overpriced shops and cruise ships coming in for visitors. That would be one of a few things that I could have done without. I can’t imagine what it’s like in the summer. My opinion just stay near the park and spend your time there unless you like the crowds. Otherwise just a beautiful place!!"
Beautiful National Park,"We were there in peak foliage season.  The ocean, the forest, the hikes were all beautiful!  This is an amazing, not to be missed, National Park"
Fantastic National Park!!,We took the bus tour through the park. It was absolutely gorgeous. The leaves were starting to turn and everything was cool and crisp. Our tour guide was excellent and GA e us lots of information. Will absolutely be back. The local town was quaint and had lots of great shops!!
Avoid sand wall campground,"No rules enforced here..... Only a couple spots left, we got the one with the barking dogs next door. Dogs barking owners yelling STOP BARKING then the generator was fired up for two hours unfortunately right at dinner time. Not a pleasant experience!"
Absolutely beautiful,We did a tour into the park and wish we could have spent a lot more time.  This is a place we hope to drive back to so we can do some of the hiking trails and spend more time just enjoying the scenery!!
Incredibly Beautiful,"A great walk along the seashore (on the Ocean Path), another great walk along a lake shore (at Jordan Pond), relatively easy hikes (for New England) to mountain tops with spectacular ocean views, an easy drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain, some challenging climbs, and lots and lots of rocks to climb on (for those of us who love that sort of thing). It's all wonderful. Except for the crowds (which is why this place gets only 4 stars). Parking is almost impossible - especially at popular spots like Jordan Pond, Sand Beach, and Thunder Hole. Take the free Island Explorer bus and save yourself the agony of trying to find parking."
Stunning views,A beautiful drive through this national park to get to the top of Cadillac mountain where the view is great.
Beautiful Scenery,"Maine had been on the bucket list of places in the US to visit. Relatives had told us about Acadia, I'm glad they did. Beautiful scenery, breath taking views of the coast. This was well worth the drive."
A must see - a slice of pure natural beauty ,"Bar Harbor itself is a beautiful little town with lots of great eats and quality shops. The real gem is Acadia National park with its pure beauty, fresh air and sights of Mother Nature to behold.  Don’t miss this park and hop on hop off bus (included in your ticket to enter the park) and easy to buy from the info center right in Bar Harbor - then come back for some lobster and revel in your days experience"
This is a must,"This is an absolute must do in Bar Harbor.  The natural sites are amazing.  If you like to hike, this is the place for you.There are easy to difficult hikes to do in the park.  Cadillac Mountain is a must see.  Must be seen in good weather.Be careful with kids, especially younger ones, this may not be a good place to take them.Went to lunch at Jordan Pond House.  The popups were excellent."
Interesting sights,"As this was my first New England/Canada cruise I booked some sightseeing tours to get to know the ports better. The tour of Acadia took us through the park while the guide talked about the history, and told many details about how it was formed. It was interesting to know about how the land was obtained and what is being done to maintain it."
Must visit,The visitors center is a must. A very busy place but very helpful and worth the it takes time to visit..
Huge Park with many Highlights,"Spent half a day checking out Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, and the top of the mountain. Many more things to see if time allows. Parking is challenging."
A beautiful place as most national parks are.,"If you're in this neck of the woods, don't miss the one way drive, and stop at every attraction.  You'll know where they are by the crowds.  Then go to the Chart Room just ourside the Hulls Cove entrance for great seafood."
Boston paled in comparison to Maine,We stayed at various places. Enjoyed the hiking and the vistas. I am sure we will be back. People were very welcoming.I enjoyed the shopping. We lobed it.
This park should be on your bucket list!,"We spent 3 days hiking and sightseeing at Acadia National Park.  I would say that was the perfect amount of time to visit. My husband and daughter hiked the Beehive and Precipice Trails and they loved them.  It was some of the most difficult, scary and rewarding hikes they have ever done.(See other posts on these trails) Must be very fit to do them and no fear of heights.  Other trails that we all enjoyed was the South Bubble Trail to Bubble Rock. (Make sure not to miss the view of Jordan Pond once you are at Bubble Rock. Head down a short path toward Jordan Pond once you reach the top) We also enjoyed the Great Head Trail, and Ocean Trail. All the trails we hiked had some amount of rock scrambling and elevation change.  We had lunch and popovers at Jordan Pond House.  The popovers were good, but not sure they live up to the hype.  If you have a clear night, drive back into the park to see an amazing amount of stars and part of the Milky Way. We drove to Bass Harbor to see a sunset along with the hundreds of others trying to get a good picture.  If you do this, you have to get there at least an hour before sunset or more.  Parking is crazy there and in popular points along Loop road, which is one way traffic in most of it.  We saw some tide pools at Schooner Head Trail, but didn't see much, except a few things in the anemone cave, which has to be visited at low tide only and is very slippery.  I highly recommend taking some sort of boat tour to see the islands from the water as well as spending a half day to shop around Bar Harbor. It was a beautiful place to visit!"
Come when cruise ships leave,"This a beautiful national park.  Unfortunately, when cruise ships come to Bar Harbor, this place is overwhelming with crowds — especially Cadillac Mountain.  Go visit some of the pristine harbor towns that surround the island."
Beautiful but beware of lack of parking at busy times,Beautiful views and hikes. We wished we could have tried the popovers but there was a huge wait and they don't do carryout. It was very hard to find parking as well. I would recommend taking one of the bus tours.
Great Park,"We took a bus tour through the park around the main loop. It was fun to hear about the history, but the trip was too fast to see a lot of the sites. When we stopped and walked around on our own, it was wonderful. The views were amazing. If you are so inclined, I would recommend getting bus to/from the park and then spending the time on foot exploring and seeing everything."
Beautiful!!!,Loved every second. Will return but NOT go on weekend or Columbus day again as too many cars and people. We enjoyed hiking from Sand Beach to Otter Point. Views were fabulous and took lots of the side paths. Suggest good hiking shoes because of rocks and tree limbs sticking out of ground. Also enjoyed wandering around the top of Cadillac Mountain. The walk out to Bar Island during low tide was somewhat underwhelming but crossing a bay by foot during low tide seemed like a pretty exciting thing to do.
Most Beautiful Park,Don't miss this park.  One could easily spend an entire day or more here.  The park is beautiful.  We only had time for a 2.5 hour tour but it was gorgeous.  Next time will definitely take a carriage ride.
A must!,Absolutely stunning!  I could easily spend several days hiking around this area.  Amazing views and great hiking.  I would love to visit again!
Majestic Acadia,"Acadia earns its name of one of the most beautiful parks.  The wind swept views, striated rocks and forests are all gorgeous.  The small fishing village nestled along the coast was a must see.  We loved it."
Beautiful Maine National Park,This is a stunning beautiful park on the coast of Maine.  Where else do you get the rockbound coast and Cadilac Mountain where the sun hit the US firsrt each day! Plewnty of trails to hike and most of them are easy. It is just too bad that the Trump admin. bumped the admission fee up to 25 dollars.  I remember when it was free. Fall is a great time to see the Park.  Can be very busy in Summer
You have to do this!!!,"Beautiful, spectacular views for all.  Easy hikes (walks) along the ocean, to climbing up a thousand feet.  Only bummer is pricing.  $30 for a week long pass.  How about a one day or weekend pass?"
Nice bye pricey,Very beautiful. Pricey for a National Park. Busy as there were so many people the had to stop traffic going up to Cadillac mountain. The hiking trails were not well marked or accurate on the type. Be prepared for anything.
"Great Park, Just Avoid the Crowds","My family and I visited this park just as the fall leaves began to turn, and it was great!  As usual when visiting national parks, we stayed off the beaten trail to avoid crowds.  Our hikes included:-Flying Mountain-Beachcroft Trail -Dorr MountainWe hiked each of these earlier in the day to avoid crowds; on each hike, we saw maybe ten other hikers...it was great!  We did, however, drive the park loop and pulled off to take some photos of the fall colors.  We also went to Cadillac Mountain to see the sunrise, and it was very crowded; however, people were very respectful, and it was cool cheering with the masses as the sun peaked over the horizon across the Atlantic Ocean.  Great park!  A definite must-see sometime in your life if you live in the US!"
Stunning Views,"I read a blog somewhere before our trip to Mount Desert Island that stated, ""Maine is best seen by foot"".  I would totally agree with that statement!!  We definetley would not have enjoyed our weekend in Bar Harbor without parking and walking/hiking as much as we did.  The views from the fire tower were breathtaking.  The only way to see those views are hiking up there. There are easier trails and harder trails, and did not know which one was which until we had taken the hardest one up and spoke with a park ranger when we reached the summit of Beech Mt. Nevertheless, we took the easier way down.  Fall colors not quite in their prime, but close!!  So pretty!!!  Make sure you get some sort of trail maps before arriving at a trail head."
Beautiful,The park is absolutely beautiful. This is a must see when in the area. The views of the coast are outstanding.
"Bike, Hike, and watch the sunset","We had a great 2.5 days in Acadia. You should rent bikes and ride the carriage trails - you can go for miles and miles and it's beautiful. We hiked the Precipice Trail which was incredibly exhilarating and downright scary in places - but so glad we did it. We wished we had had a GO-Pro to film us climbing the iron rails straight up the side of the mountain. Definitely go (early!) to Cadillac Mountain for sunrise - prepare ahead, there will be waaaaay more people there than you think there will be, and it takes some time, but it is so beautiful, and a wonderful way to start a new day."
Beautiful but very busy Park,"Acadia is a beautiful national park, the coastline is stunning, even on a cloudy day.  The weather didn't cooperate fully while I was there but didn't stop us from hiking every day and enjoying the many trails.  The east side of the park, closest to Bar Harbor is very busy on a nice day, the parking lots get full late morning/early afternoon sometimes making it difficult to hit everything you might want to see on the loop road, however, if you're prepared to hit one of the many lovely trails, you will find the crowds quickly dwindle.  Be sure to hit the west side of Acadia as well as the Schoodic Penninsula where the crowds are also significantly less but the scenery equally as beautiful."
Stunning,"Pay the park fee.  You won't regret it.  The drive through the park offers lots and lots of spots to stop, walk to the edge of the water, and take the most beautiful pictures.  We saw our first bald eagle, and just inside the park a deer that was very photogenic.  We drove to the very top of the mountain, just as the fog was coming in off the ocean, providing beautiful visits of fog clouds swirling over the outlying islands.  Perfect!"
Fantastic Hiking,"People we met on previous hiking trips had been telling us for years we would love hiking here and we did. I had researched trails before going. We used the REI national parks app and All Trails as well as advice from our innkeeper to combine trails. We did 13 hikes in five days in all kinds of conditions. We always used an app to find driving routes and parking and started by 9am. We were rarely on the loop road and always got parking in a designated area. One day we did a point to point and took the free shuttle back to our car. We had a National parks pass or you can stop at the visitors center to buy a pass.We hiked all difficulties of trails and had an amazing experience! There is an excellent waterproof trails map I got online that was also for sale at the visitors center. There were restrooms at several trailheads that were well maintained. The trails are all marked with wooden posts, larger rock cairns and blue blazes on rocks and trees. It was very easy to make most hikes a loop by combining trails."
"beautiful coastlines, ponds, & mountains / Summer crowds ","Acadia is beautiful with much to see and do.  I love the views from Cadillac Mountain and hiking around Jordan Pond. It was crowded during our August visit (compared to 5 years ago) and parking was difficult to find at several spots on the Park Loop.  If you visit during peak times, park your car and take the free shuttle (mid-June through early October).The Visitors Center (maps, movie, information, shuttle stop, parking) and the Park Loop Road are good places to start your visit, but don’t forget that Acadia NP extends beyond there, so don’t miss the rest."
Beautiful Park,Acadia is a beautiful park and  had never heard of it until we planned our cruise. Be sure to get to the top of Cadillac Mountain and to the beach. The blowhole is great when the tide is high. Take a guide such as MDI Tours.
It was beautiful,"Spent most of time trying to get around places in loop. If I had to do over, would have taken tour. You have to go all around loop to get back to things you want to see. Very annoying. Spent hours driving around. I think you can do all on tour that lasts 3 hours. But it still was beautiful."
Beautiful park but crowded ,The park is great but very crowded.  You may want to consider riding the free buses as some stops have no parking spots on crowded days.  One complaint I have is the number of people with dogs on trails and at scenic stops. Please leave your pets at home as a courtesy to others.
Stunning views on a clear day,Beautiful views from the top of Cadillac Mountain. We were fortunate that the day we visited it was a clear blue sky. Sometimes they close the drive to the top of the mountain due to fog. We only had a day here but I would like to go back for several days. So many great trails to hike. Rocks are smooth and easy to walk on.
Great National Park,"We have visited this park three times.  Each time we found different feelings.  In this trip, we found the Thunder Hole during high tide and a storm.  Simply amazing."
Beautiful park,"Well, we live in the Pacific Northwest so we are spoiled with scenic wonder. But Acadia can hold its own. The drive is beautiful. We stopped a few times to wander and enjoyed our visit. BTW...we laughed as we drove past Bear Creek Picnic Area. We decided not to tempt the bears."
You know it’s Great ,"From cracking waves, granite coastlines, mountains, and dramTic scenery, Acadia National Park is of course phenomenal. Park loop road has much to offer and routes you to the main attractions such as Thunder Hole, Otter Cliffs, and Jordan Pond.  Mother Nature didn’t cooperate, but we still thoroughly enjoyed our time here"
Stunning national park,This was a spectacular national park - clearly signposted.  Has a mixture of beautiful coastline views and also views from Cadillac Mountain.  Loved it
Great views but wouldl be amazing in late October,The scenery in the park was very nice and relaxing. The fall colors had just begun but a couple of weeks later would have been amazing.
Beautiful in Autumn,"We read some materials and chose to see the Visitors Center film, drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain and some of the Park Loop, and hike around Jordan Pond.  We did that in a morning. It was cold and windy at the summit, so we didn't stay long. I would have if it were warmer. It must be hard for the driver to enjoy the views on the way since it is such a windy road  It was beautiful for the Jordan Pond hike. Perfect temps and not windy. It was a moderate hike because at one point it was through some rocks. I didn't love the wooden trail, but the rocks and regular trails were great. Lots of spots to take photos.We started the Park Loop going counter clockwise which didn't work well. At one point the road became one way or exit. So we exited and didn't finish it. There were beautiful views on it and the way to CadillacLater we timed the tides and went to the sandbar off West st. We walked to Bar Island which was cool. I went back later to catch the sunset and the sandbar was covered in waterDon't miss it. There is much more than a days worth of stuff to do"
Majestic!,Leave plenty of time for Acadia National Park. This park is perfect no matter what your levels of capability are. There are activities for everyone. If you like strenuous hikes there are plenty. If you would rather drive the park you can do that as well. The views are amazing. We were there at the very end of September and I enjoyed the fact that there were less people around.
This Park does the US proud!,"This is a very large park with so many attractions, trails, and America's splendor and beauty on full display!  It was quite busy at the end of September, my guess is many people were there to see the leaves changing color, but most everything is still green!"
Beauty,First time at this park.  Bucket list trip.  It was everything I imagined and more!  So beautiful and peaceful.  We arrived to the park late evening as the sun was setting.  But to my amazement the harvest moon was coming up and it was breath taking.  Pictures do not do it justice.  I will never forget that moment.
"Beyond excellent, mind numbing beauty everwhere you look.","One of the few places we have been where we could not get enough of. Breathtaking beauty all around you at every turn. And for the hiker, well, just wow!"
Sunrise on Cadillac Mountain,"We drove up to Cadillac mountain for sunrise and were surprised to find many cars there, even though we were there a half hour before the sunrise.The traffic and crowd was worth it for a spectacular sunrise!We then spent the rest of the day visiting the park by doing the loop drive and hiking several of it's trails."
3 days in Acadia and could have stayed longer!,"We've been to a lot of national parks and I would rate this one of the highest out of all the parks we've been too.  So many vistas, so many spectacular coastal views.  The carriage road trails were fantastic if you like hiking but want more level ground to walk on (they parallel all the hiking trails which are a bit more difficult and more for the surefooted and experienced hiker).  The iconic waterfall bridge is a must see (especially for photographers).  Eagle lake carriage road trail is also spectacular.  Cadillac mountain views are incredible, but the place is always busy and parking is difficult (I hear in the morning at sunrise you can't even get a space to park up there).  Try to get out to most stops early (before 10AM to those places you really want to see).  We went in the first week of October and the colors were starting to change already (this is the last week you really want to come to Nova Scotia/Maine) as many attractions and restaurants/hotels start to close down (especially in the Maritimes).  The weather was little cool but it was worth not having to buck the summer crowds.  Many of the overlooks are right on the 27 mile loop and everything is pretty easy to find (but I would recommend getting some detailed information and maps on the trails so you know where you are going beforehand).  Some of the trails are not well marked in terms of destinations (you won't see a sign for the waterfall bridge).  So get your maps and do your homework and planning before coming to the park to make get the most out of it. Its definitely worth the trip.  One last hint: they have been working on some road construction in Bar Harbor so ask your hotel if they are affected by the construction.  We stayed at the Atlantic Oceanside hotel which was in the middle of a one way 6 mile loop that you had to travel on to go downtown (which was very close).  Some hotels are more conveniently located in relation to the construction.  Anyway, this park is really worth the visit and reminds me how beautiful are own country really is!"
Amazing Place,"My husband and I traveled all around Acadia National Park; Park Loop Road, Cadillac Summit Road/Cadillac Mountain Trail, as well as several of the amazing trails (Flying Mountain Trail, Great Head Trail), and more. We spent a full day there, but could easily have spent a week there exploring all the park had to offer. The trails were amazing - the sights, the smells, the sounds - it was incredible every single direction you turned! (Not to mention, we found it really helpful that they mark the trails with small blue lines of paint so you know you're staying on the trail...there are a lot of small paths that lead off of the main path.) And, to make things even BETTER, we happened to go on one of the Free Fee Days! We absolutely LOVED our time in Acadia National Park."
Amazing National Park!,"Okay, so I have only been to three national parks in my lifetime, Grand Teton, Yellowstone, and Acadia. Though they are all very different, I have to say my favorite is Acadia. Why do you ask? It is due to the ease at which I can reach it (FREE bus), the quality of the hiking (maintenance of trails as well as variety in difficulty levels, and terrain). It is such a relaxed atmosphere as well. Though I visited during high season, and there were A LOT of people there, you could always find a trail to wonder on your own, mediate, take in the beauty, be one with nature. I traveled alone (female) and it felt safe and I had the option to be with the crowd or not. It was a great way to reset and so easy to travel into the park each day. If you think it is just another national park, and a small one at that, you are missing out."
Great place to hike and see great views!,"This was our first visit to Acadia and we loved it.  Best thing was the hiking.  Many of the trails provide a challenge, especially The Precipice and The Beehive, for out of shape 50-somethings like us, but are not so long that they take all day.  And then you are rewarded with spectacular views of the bay and islands.  Cadillac Mtn at sunrise is a must, well worth the effort to get up early.  I would hate to go in the summer though.  Better to go in the fall like we did to avoid all the congestion."
GORGEOUS NATIONAL PARK,Stopped at lake which was clear and picturesque.  The photo looks  like the exact spot were at although every spot there is beautiful.  A bit crowded on this day - weather was perfect.
Always a great National Park to visit,"Acadia National Park is beautiful, diverse, and very close to where we stayed in Bar Harbor, Maine.  Since we visited ANP 9 years ago, we chose to take a boat to Little Cranberry Island, view Bass Harbor Lighthouse, take the hike around Jordon Pond, and see the Nighttime sky on top of Cadillac Mountain."
Spectacular Views of the coast and hills,"We never miss a national park if we're in the area, so we swung by Bar Harbor for a couple of nights to visit the town and the park.  By far and away, the main thrust of the park is the conjunction of ocean and shore, with several stops on the one way road to that effect."
took a private tour  through the park,"I can't believe it took me all these years to get there.  I'd really like to go back, perhaps take one of those carriage rides trough the park"
Gorgeous National Park,"I admit, I am a National Park Geek.  Acadia is just gorgeous and oh so peaceful in the fall.  The water views, trees changing color, cliffs and wildlife will keep you coming back for more.  The mountain vistas and ocean views are just gorgeous.  Make sure to do the Park Loop Road up to Cadillac Mountain for some amazing vistas."
"we love Acadia, one of the most beautiful places on earth","We have been visiting and experiencing Acadia for decades; it never gets old.  We have been there for most of the seasons, although autumn is our favorite.  Our age is increasing but our enthusiasm has not waned at all;  our athleticism has diminished but our love for Acadia has never diminished;  we would go again next week in a heartbeat"
LOVE this park!,"I've been to Acadia National Park several times over the years and it never disappoints. Each time we've driven to the summit of Cadillac Mountain (short, easy drive). It doesn't matter if you get there for sunrise, sunset or mid-day ... it's gorgeous. Beautiful view of the ocean, islands, boats and park. I haven't experienced sunrise there yet, or hiked it, but hope to do both some day. If you are in the Bar Harbor area, it's a must-see. The only drawback is that it gets crowded so pack your patience and enjoy!"
An American gem,"This is a national park that everyone should visit within their lifetime.  We visited in the fall and the leaves were just starting to change.  Spent about 5 hours here but could have spent 2 days, visiting all the sections of the park.  If you are a hiker, this is a wonderful area."
Fall hike,Acadia is absolutely stunning.  There are so many different trails.  One of the best things is that the trails are rated by difficulty so you can decide which trails to take based on your ability.  I went in September after school was in session but before the leaves turn and the park was still crowded.  Parking was sometimes a challenge but it made me walk more.  I love that you can do the ocean walk as well as the forest walk.
Love the bike ride,We did 20 miles on our mountain bikes and broke it up with lunch at Jordan House.  Cruise ship was in so quite a few people walking bikes.  Views were beautiful and it was so nice not to have to worry about cars on the carriage roads.
Gorgeous for fall colors!,The park is absolutely lovely in the fall but I imagine all year round it's worth the visit. It's not as well marked as other parks but it's not difficult to find your way. Several of the trails were very rocky so having a walking stick can be helpful so it's easier to keep your footing when they are loose/wet.  The views over the water are delightful and it's a pretty easy hike in most places.
Great day,Arrived on a cruise ship.  There is a free bus system in the park there is no need to book a tour.  Bus stop was a short walk we took the bus to the beach and walked the costal trail.  Went to thunder hole and a couple of other stops.
Beautiful park,"Plan to spend at least a couple of days in the park, and be sure to get a popover at Jordan pond!  A beautiful spot when you need a break in your hikes."
lots to see and do,There is a ton to see and do in Acadia! My husband and I stayed in the area for 2 weeks. We did not get board!
Check this one off my bucket list,"I've frequently visited Maine over the last 15 years, but this was the first time we'd ventured all the way up to Bar Harbor and Acadia and it won't be the last. We spent about three days in the area and managed to see a lot -- even though there was a lot of fog most of the time we were there. We took a tour bus through the park the first morning to get an overview and see the key sites -- Thunder Hole, the Jordan Pond House and Cadillac Mountain. And then we took the free buses from downtown Bar Harbor or drove into the park at other points to spend more time exploring. It's a beautiful place and not to be missed."
Wonderful Park,"I only had an afternoon in this park, but it was worth it. I took the drive up from Boston, which was long (5+ hours). The interstate is not that scenic, but the faster of the two routes. I'd love to go back and drive route 1 up there. Anyway, the park is gorgeous. The highlight for me was Beehive trail, which is quickly accessible from the main beach. The trail is challenging, and not for all, but full of stark ladders and breathtaking views. It was a quick, but exhilarating hike up, and perfect for those who only have a short time. I can't wait to get back to this park."
Wonderful gift of nature and scenic grandeur!,"Spent three nights in Bar Harbor at one of the B&B's (Asygarth Station, reviewed elsewhere). Absolutely astonished at the beauty and grandeur of the park, a true natural treasure to be preserved forever. I won't cover the more popular sites (Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach, etc. other to say that they are worth the visit). Jordan Pond however blew me away. Hiked the trail the first day in the fog, couldn't see more than 100' in any direction and it was a lovely hike. Returned the next day in clear, sunny conditions and just the view from the meadow looking out to the Bubbles is worth the trip. As many people have said, go early to get good parking spots and to avoid the crowds. We were there late September and when the cruise ships come in, the sheer number of people can be over whelming. Did several hikes, stop at the Visitors Center and get a topographical map for $5 if you intend to hike any of the trails to get a really good idea of what your in for. Be careful when looking at the reviews on the trails as some of them aren't very accurate. We hike Hadlock Brook Trail which is a difficult stone and root strewn trail which someone had miss labeled as the Hadlock Carriage trail, so be thorough and know your trails."
A must see......and a want to go back soon!!,Well kept park with lots of options.  Loved the sunsets and sunrises and the ocean beating up against the rocky shores!!  Great trails.  Wish I would have had my bike.  3 days was not enough.
Spectacular,"Views.......unbelievable!  Truly the most amazing scenery offered on the Eastern Seaboard.  Park is incredibly maintained and worth every second of your time to meander, well marked trails lead to adventure and awesome nature.  A must do in the park is to venture to the top of Cadillac Mountain, gorgeous views of Bar Harbor and surrounding islands."
"Great place for walking, hiking, biking, even driving","We re-visited Acadia Park on our visit to Bar Harbor. We spent two days at the park - on the first day we started at Sand Beach and walked to Thunder Hole. On the second day we walked part-way around Eagle Lake on the carriage road. Both walks were wonderful; the first had fantastic ocean scenery, the second was much more quiet and peaceful. We parked at the top end of Echo lake where there are toilets. Drives through the park are also lovely; most roads are one-way with two lane travel, making stopping or passing very easy. The only down-side are the large number of tour buses on the ocean route, mostly stopping at Thunder Hole."
Glorious,"My first time in Acadia National Park and I cannot wait to come back.  I drove out from California just to photograph the Birch trees.  I was not disappointed one bit, I was SO happy that I stayed out in the cold all day taking hundreds of photos of birch trees and all the colorful parts of the park that I could. The scenery is absolutely  stunning, you could not go wrong with any part of the park.  A must see if you are on the East coast."
Best US National Park of the East,Totally surreal! Wonderful views! Tons of hiking opportunities. Cadillac Mountain and Rocky shoreline of Maine will just wow you!
Visit the Quiet Side!,"Acadia is set up a little bit different from other National Parks. First, you buy your pass in any number of places, and hang the tag from the rearview mirror.  You must have it visible, or you will be issued a ticket. The fine for non-compliance is $130 according to another visitor. The scenic loop has a lot of beautiful views, places to stop and admire the scenery. Cadillac Mountain is definitely worth the drive. Even at the end of September, parking by Sandy Beach and Thunderhole is crowded. After you've done the loop, drive over to the quiet side and walk the trails, see the tidal pools and enjoy the beauty and quiet."
natural wonder,"A beautiful place not to be missed! So many breath taking views, quiet walking trails, hiking from easy to adventurous."
Gorgeous views!,We took a tour bus from our cruise ship to Acadia National Park & Cadillac Mt.  We were fortunate to be there on a clear day so the views were amazing!  It was much cooler & windier at the top so be prepared with a jacket. Really enjoyed the stone bridges in the park & the carriage trails. Went here years ago to experience sunrise.  The park was as beautiful as I remember.
What vistas!,"The shoreline is incredible!  Trails were long but not difficult.  Satisfied a ""bucket List"" desire.  Weather was perfect for hiking.  Didn't see much wildlife, but folks said it was too popular with humans!  The L.L.Bean shuttles are a welcome necessity to save you from walking too far to get to trail heads."
Stunning Expanse,"Cliché as it sounds, this place is just another spot of heaven on Earth - and God knows we need those! With crystal clear ponds, mountain ranges that leave you mesmerized, and sea-air that leaves you rejuvenated, it's hard not to fall in love with this place!"
Magnificent!,"This is the reason we came to Bar Harbor - Acadia! The park is incredible! In its own way, rivals other National parks in the US.When you see visitors from other countries, you know that this park is both unique and very special.If you only have the day to tour, go early, preferably during the week, and stop by at least three places: Sand Beach, Jordan pond and of course Cadillac Mountain.To get to the first two, take the park loop road. To Cadillac Mountain, Cadillac summit road. You will not be disappointed!"
Beautiful!,"We really enjoyed our time in Acadia National Park.  Many great views and overlooks, picnic areas, etc."
Can't believe it took me this long to get to Acadia!,"The 27 mile look has amazing coastal view. We did several challenging hikes, drove up to Cadillac Mountain for sunset, ate popovers at Jordan Pond and more!"
What an adventure ,So many things to do at the park. The trails are kept up beautifully. Jordan Pond was very easygoing on one side then the other side you are crawling over boulders and walking on planks. Might not be for everyone.  Some were saying they just do the one side. Cadillac Mountain was at the top of the highest mountain in the park. So many things to do here. Family friendly on some of the hikes. Sandy Beach was another great stop.
First timer...wish I had gone sooner!,"This is a lovely park, with breathtaking views, especially along the shore loop!  We are unable to hike the trails, but there are enough opportunities for enjoyment . We ate at Jordan’s Pond...fabulous!  But make sure you have reservations in advance. The carriage rides provide a unique look into the history of the park and relaxing as well."
Must visit if in Bar Harbour,"Arrived on a cruise ship for one day, went to the Village Green to obtain or membership for the National Park which was $15 each, obtained a map with the routes that the buses take,so easy a hop on hop off system,every bus stop gives a timetable with the next couple of buses due to arrive. We started off leaving the Village Green on 3 then changed to 4 and finally returned to the Village Green on a 5, the views were spectacular, can,t recommend enough."
Will be returning!  So much to see and do,"Our time was too short, but we hiked Cadillac Mountain, and did two other short hikes with friends who live there.  We did a coastal hike and made it out too Schoodic Point too.  BEAUTIFUL part of the country.  Weather was great in early September.  Enjoyed everywhere we ate, and enjoyed doing a little shopping in Southwest harbor."
Beautiful National Park,Lots to visit and do here for any person whether extremely fit or looking to do a driving/vista tour. I was traveling with a torn meniscus and was still able to see many great vantage points without having to walk far or on rocky trails. Crowds were very manageable - traveled there in September. Good variety of restaurants in and around town. Recommend the water trip out of Northeast Harbor - Sea Princess. Very informative!
""" Majestic Beauty ""","Truly a National Treasure, magnificent beauty of untouched nature. The park is simply one of a kind!"
Absolutely Beautiful,"Incredible vistas, great hiking and great value, a vehicle pass was only $30 for a week of access. A must see! The view from Cadillac Mtn is breathtaking."
beautiful peace of nature in Maine,This park is so beautiful--the opportunities to get out and enjoy nature are all around you. The trails are fun and were not crowded at all like Grand Canyon n.p. Signage is good for directions. We saw a beautiful sunset on top of Cadillac Mountain and had popovers at the Jordan House. Huffing away I made it to the top of Bubble Rock trail. We couldn't do Thunder Hole because of the timing of tides. Otter Point was wild and had gorgeous rocks. The park is glorious!!!
National Treasure!,"We spent a few days exploring the park with a friend from the area. We made multiple hikes and have left postings on individual stops. Having a local guide was a major plus, however there are numerous resources, guidebooks, TA reviews! and National Park signs that make this a very easy place to enjoy. A true National Treasure and one of the highlights of the East Coast National Park system. Helpful Tips:- Buy a parking pass in advance- Bring Water!- Restrooms are found throughout the park, bring wipes- We found the park to be very dog friendly"
Beautiful any time of year!!,Make sure you visit Acadia..check out thunder hole..Jordon Pond..take the oneway perimeter loop road..stop often..walk some and take lots of photos
Breathtaking beauty,I have been wanting to go to this National Park for years. I was amazed at how many acres it is and the diverse environments within the park. The hiking trails are the best I have ever experienced. You take away the importance of preserving nature and a renewed sense of peace and tranquility
SPECTACULAR VIEWS,Acadia is a beautiful park with several features that you don't want to miss.  The view from Cadillac Mountain is breathtaking.  They have hiking trails for all levels of hikers.
Beautiful Maine,Schoodic peninsula is breathtaking. We stayed in Allbee’s Shorehouse cottages just steps from the water and hiked in the park. The rocky shorelines and lobster boats in the water made for beautiful sunsets!
Beautiful scenery and lots of things to do,"Acadia National Park is a gem. With 2 locations, one on Mt. Desert Island and another part on the nearby Schoodic Peninsula, and many small towns nearby with additional facilities and activities, there is something for everyone. On Mt. Desert Island, we especially liked the Ocean Walk, Ship Head Trail, the Carriage Roads and Jordan Pond.  The Schoodic Peninsula is much less visited, but has gorgeous views."
"Beautiful, just beautiful",We had just one day to spend in Acadia and it wasn't nearly enough.  There is stunning beauty everywhere you look!  Hikes that range from easy to expert and a tenderfoot can even see a lot of the comfort of their car.  I will be going back.  The steps to the visitor's center are a climb but worth the effort for the movie and the info the rangers can give you.  Definitely a bucket list destination.
Beautiful location,"We visited on a very misty day so the best sights were not visible - however what we did see was really lovely.  There is a very nice restaurant at Jordan Pond with a lovely gift shop.  Only down side, out in the park the toilet facilities are pretty grim - well worth a visit."
Beautiful Scenery,Took a 3 hour trolley tour of the park.  Got some great background information as well as a chance to see some of the breathtaking scenery.  It was a great way to experience the park.
Beautiful National Park,"Something for every level of fitness. Tons of driving options, hiking and tours available. This park is a national treasure. We were there just as the leaves began to turn and enjoyed the splashes of color. Don't miss the drive up to the top of Cadillac Mountain for the most spectacular views. Check in at the Visitors Center for your park pass and helpful tips from the rangers."
beautiful views,This is a beautiful park to drive through just outside of downtown Bar Harbor. Great views of the ocean and rocky cliffs.
AMAZING!,"From the park entrance to the top of Cadillac Mountain-it was amazing.  Mother Nature was having a great day when she created this area.  From woods to rocky shore line.  Check out every overlook, every view is different.  Plan a full afternoon for the drive.  We brought along a picnic lunch. Sat and ate watching wild turkeys."
Beautiful but crowded,"We often travel in September after Labor Day when most kids are in school, but before the leaf peepers are out.  That strategy didn't work for avoiding crowds in Acadia.  We were able to get into the Hulls Cove Visitor Center, but it was crowded.  Tried driving up Cadillac Mountain, but traffic was bumper to bumper near the top.  We couldn't find a parking space and never got out of the car.  On the way down, we saw that park rangers had just closed the road going up the mountain.  The next day we tried going to the nature center - no parking.  And Thunder Hole was just crawling with people.  The parts of the park that we were able to see were wonderful."
Beautiful Park,Beautiful park.  Clean and great walking paths.  Could see forever from the top of the mountain and was stunning.
Wish We Had Longer - Loved It,"Sadly we only had one day to explore, which is clearly not enough time as this National Park has so much to see and do.  We decided to get recommendations from the visitor centre and covered the main areas.  You are able to drive around the Park which certainly saves some time getting to various locations.  Stunning views along the way too.  First stop was a drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain - awesome views at the top and well worth the trip - we then headed down and found a nice 3 mile loop trail to do - it was a bit tricky in places but really satisfying and some fantastic views of the ocean along the way.  Love that the Park is doggy friendly too - wish we had our doggy with us.  So much fun for them!  Definitely want to come back and spend more time here."
4 day trip,We were in and out of Acadia National Park for 4 days.  You can drive around (or take the shuttles) and stop to see the amazing views on the many turn-outs.  It was foggy often when we were there but still beautiful.
"Great park, but crowded even in September.","We loved it here. Great park loop drive, amazing hikes with awesome views. but it was still very busy even in September."
Beautiful !,"We were surprised at how easy it was to get around.  we caught the bus at the square in bar harbor and road into the park, getting on and off different buses, changing buses to change the direction we were going.  Always easy to get on and never had to wait long.  Did some hikes and just really enjoyed ourselves."
The Gem of the East,This has to be one of the most beautiful parks in America.  There are great hiking trails and is the only place to see fijords in the US. It is truly a magical place!
We had a foggy visit,"Although we battled fog for three days we loved the park. We had to make two trips up Cadillac Mountain to get a view and we did. The loop road trip was wonderful. This was fall so we really didn't spend any time at sand beach but it looked great. We had a very nice visit at the wild gardens and nature center with a one mile walk on the board walk, Missed Jordan lake Anne people raved about it and the carriage ride. We enjoyed the park from the nature tour boat out of bar harbor. Viewing the shore line is better from a boat"
Awesome,Great place to come any time of the year one of the nicest parks on the east coast you could spend days here.
Beautiful in September and not as crowded,"We were fortunate to have bright sunny days during our September visit, with only a little morning fog, so the views from Cadillac, Mt. Acadia, Beech Mountain, and Schoodic Point were all top notch. We have no quibble with the various sites and apps that rate the day hikes; as one local put it, ""they're all good -- enjoy the ones you choose and don't worry about the ones you miss."" That said, we made a point of getting up and out early, and looking for less busy trails. For us, a day hiking on Schoodic Peninsula was a day exquisitely well spent. We also came to understand why people bring camp chairs and just watch the tide roll in. What a show!"
It's a bucket list park,"The morning sunrise was beautiful.  Seeing all the people there watching the sun come up on top of this hill was pretty cool.  Cold and early.  I definitely like the sunset at Key West better but sill this was nice, glad I did it.  Wouldn't do it again.  Signage in this expensive national park is moderate to poor, bathrooms are the visitors center are inside and it doesn't open till 8 so if you show up at 5 for the sunrise event don't go to the visitor's center.  I know this park is listed as one of the top national parks I don't know why.  Saw racoons and turkeys.  We were lucky with good weather and great visibility.  One person up at the morning sunrise event said this was his 3rd this week and the first with good weather conditions.  At the top of the mountain the view of Bar Harbor is nice but you are so far away it is mostly dots on the camera.  We visited Mt Battie two days ago.  I think the views and pictures were better the admission was $12 for two including a car, at Acadia the admission is $30 for the car and $15 for each person - $60 total.  For that amount of money I'd expect good signage and bathrooms open during big demand periods."
Beautiful ,One of the coolest places. You defiantly need an entire day here. And a lot of it is drivable. U can hike as much or as little as u want. We will be back bc we didn’t have enough time
Fantastic at every turn!,"You must see as much of this National Park that you can when on Mt. Desert Island! The park loop road is worth the drive but if you hike at all, get on those trails, the views are spectacular! They are a bit difficult, but if you are in shape it is worth the hike."
SIMPLY SPECTACULAR !!!!!,This is a must see attraction when in the area.  THere is not much around except for Bar Harbor that is about 3 blocks long but it is fantastic views and trails.Great food in the area and beautiful sights.
"Not my top choice for national parks, but still something to be said","So, if you are looking for picture perfect green and water, you've hit the jackpot.If you are more into nature amazing creations, not it.As always, started at the visitor's center. Have entered through Hulls Cove.You park and need to go upstairs to the place itself in order to get a park permit, if you are not holding an annual one.Nice and smiley ranger was there, but the most unhelpful one I have encountered till today.The first thing you should know about the park, is that the trails are entwined into one another and you can make short ones, or longer as you see fit, which is awesome and this most important detail was known to me only when I was actually trekking.As for the list of trails, it isn't freely given with the map like other parks, you have to purchase it. I don't know what's on it, since I have relied on ""All Trails Pro"" which in hindsight, wasn't very useful either.You can see in the pics an example to how the trails are built.As for Camping, I went to the closer site, Blackwoods Campground, which is reviewed separately.First day I have parked in Sand Beach and went on the Ocean Path, which is more of a stroll, with niches to get very nice views of the ocean and Sand Beach, finished at Otter Cliffs and went back to the Gorham Mountain trailhead.At this point you can see how some trails can be combined.I have made the trail into a loop, that landed me back close to Sand Beach where my car was parked.Just follow the signs you want. You can't really get lost.Most of the trail is rocky and I would categorize it as moderate to easy. Back to Sand Beach and down the stairs to Great Head Trail.You cross the beach and there's a small U turn at the Beehive lake.You can loop that too. The way up is a little bit more challenging, the way down if you loop it, is easy.All the trails took me about 5 hours.Second day Jordan Pond.Take a right after a pretty boring mile and you have interesting trails - Bubble Rock, Eagle Lake. Uphill, some rocky. The north Bubble Summit is beautiful.Eagle lake not as much.The trails don't loop and I came out from the point I have entered.Then about 2 more miles back to the parking lot, around the pond.This way is a bit more challenging if you are just looking for a stroll.This has taken me about 4 hours and added up to about 7 miles.***wear proper shoes for Trekking***if you have T-mobile, there's no internet connection. It connects to AT&T and it's calls only. Highly recommend a drive through the island with the car.The park boundaries are blurred, so there's food, drinks and everything you want, just a little drive away. This is off season, so accommodation is easy to find in all price ranges.Trenton has a very cozy picnic area, with toilets, picnic table and a nice view.Have Fun😊"
Neat little park,"This, to me, was a very small, urbanized national park.  I really liked the busses inside the park.  I'd also say this has to be the most dog friendly national park I have been to.  The only negative is this park is also almost completely surrounded by houses, and it makes it hard to feel isolated, and it's just sad for the wildlife, they can't really come and go freely.I'd say if you want a vacation with your dog, with great restaurants, little shops, lots of history, and short hikes, this is the park for you."
Live in paradise,So I live here but visit the park often .. it’s aleays beautiful breathtaking.. if you visit please stay on the trails so the park stays beautiful and you stay safe.
AMAZING! Wish we had more time,"So many things to do!  Hiking, biking, kayaking.  BEAUTIFUL!  Would like to go back and spend more time doing other things."
Early fall/late summer treasure,First time visitors. Can't wait to come back! We stayed at an Airbnb and can't wait to come back to experience more of what the park and surroundings have to offer.
A National Treasure,"My husband and I enjoyed every minute  and every vista of this spectular place. My recommendation is to utilize the bus system they have in the park. Let them do the driving so you can enjoy more of the park. Parking spaces are also a premium inside the park. My favorite memory is stopping at Sand Beach and then walking the trial to Thunder Roll. It’s about two miles and easy. If you are a picture taker like I am, it might take you awhile. Breathtaking views,  It will not disappoint."
Beautiful,"We visited the park as part of a shore excursion , the scenic ride to the top of Cadillac mountain was wonderful and the tour around the park was beautiful."
First time visit to Acadia,"Wonderful drive up to the top and greeted with amazing views of Bar Harbor and MDI.  Took a short walk around the hiking trails at the top but was concerned we might get a ticket.  Apparently you are supposed to go to the Visitor Center and pick up a placard to show you paid.  Never saw any signs and unlike all the other Nat'l Parks, we did not see a entrance booth to show Senior Pass.  Go figure?"
Gorgeous National Park,September is a spectacular time to visit Acadia! The weather was mild and the foliage was just starting to turn colors.  The free shuttle bus is a wonderful way to get around. We stopped at all the main natural features and enjoying the immense variety. One full day was not enough for sure.
Breathtaking views,This is a gorgeous park with vistas that are beyond words. It would take several days to experience even a fraction of its vastness.  Unfortunately crowds of people are very close to ruining the splendor. The park service recommends taking the free bus. Great idea. Even in the “off season”there are very few parking spaces.  You will find yourself spending most of you time circling the lot in search of a spot. Take food and water with you. Once you pass the gates there is nowhere to buy anything except Jordan Pond and very limited parking there. Lots of people so plan ahead.
Just go and enjoy,"My last visit to Acadia National Park was 20 years ago, there were many improvements made by the park service on trails. A free shuttle bus from the visitors center takes you to various highlights in the park and reduces the car traffic and exhaust. Tickets are $30 and good for a week in the park The park loop road is about 30 miles. Highlights you should see are: Thunder hole, popovers at Jordans pond restaurant at the Bubbles, otter creek,Cadillac mountain and so much more. Just go!"
Acadia Nat'l Park,"We got up early in the morning to beat the rush of massive people that decend upon this beautiful Nat'l park. We'd seen on the news how it gets so crowded and there's no parking, so we looked into taking a tour bus or shuttle, but in the end, we decided to drive and go in early. We did hit some fog which spoiled some views, but it began to lift and we seen plenty of the forest. Stopped at Sand Beach and Thunder Hole.  It was a beautiful drive through the park that early foggy morning."
Breathtaking Adventure!,Acadia Park is a gem for all to experience and see! The scenery is beautiful and there is so much to view. We enjoyed Thunder Hole and were fortunate to hear it boom! You can see the park in a day but would recommend taking a couple of days to experience all of the Park.
Great biking trails on the carriage paths,"Three cheers to LL Bean. They help sponsor a great network of propane powered buses to get you in and around the park in the bar harbor out to the little airport and associated cities. No need to Rent-A-Car very timely service and comfortable. Great lobster is out by the airPort, wonderful shops in the village. Rent bikes from Bar Harbor bike rentals and ride the 40 miles of carriage built by the Rockefellers! Easy grade somewhere around 4%, get away from the crowds and see wonderful glacial lakes rock formations and coniferous forest."
Amazing Park,"Having been to a number of National Parks, throughout the US, this is one of our favorites, exceeded only by Yellowstone. This combines mountains, the sea, rocky shorelines, great interior trails, mountain climbing, and amazing ‘carriage roads’ for biking without ever having to see a car."
Visit during low tide & high tide,We would recommend doing the loop twice.  Once at low tide and once at high tide.  Totally different perspective between the two.The Hull Visitor Center was located 52 steps up.  Strange to see a visitor center so far from the parking lot and with so many stairs.  Not sure what they were thinking when they designed that :(
My Happy Place!,"Where else can you sit on the beach and have a picnic lunch dipping your toes into the Atlantic Ocean, then turn around and climb the highest peak on the Eastern Seaboard."
We love Acadia National Park!,"We spent a week on MDI and never left the island!  We were in Acadia each day. There's so much to see and do.  The hiking/walking paths, Jordan Pond, Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, the summit of Cadillac Mountain are just a few things to see and do.  We drove the island each day, searching the small villages and towns for things to do and see.  We found quaint shoppes and family owned restaurants.   Take time to stop, pull off the road and explore!"
Such a wonderful place,We visited Bar Harbour and Acadia from a cruise ship.  Spending time in Acadia is a must. It is such a beautiful area.
Awesme Scenery,"If you ever get to main, you have to visit Cadillac Mountain. The drive is well worth it. The view from the top of the mountain is breathtaking."
Great lunch spot,"We stopped here for lunch and weren't disappointed.  The best seafood chowder I had on my entire trip.  Would have liked to have hiked the 3.2 miles around the pond, but that will have to wait for a future visit."
Pack your camera!,Stunning 360 views from top of Cadillac Mountain and stargazing at night.  Never seen so many stars and the Milky Way so vividly!
A unique National Park,"It is easy to drive the Park loop in a day and you can see the various sights along the way.  The park is in the middle of the island, surrounded by little villages and bays along the shoreline.  It gets crowded in the summer, so give yourself time."
Beautiful views! ,Cadillac Mountain View’s were stunning. The park is very nice. The roads were a little arduous due to road work. Sand beach was a great stop; as was thunder hole. Well worth the $30 fee for our vehicle. The pass is good for 7 days. Sunset from Cadillac was very nice; but a little underwhelming. We should have done the sunrise. Oh well.....next time.
Beautiful,"If I visit again I would avoid trolly tour and drive my own car. The park is very nice and views excellent. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, but too many grumpy seniors."
Acadia National Parki,"Acadia is a fantastic place to visit (five rating).  Unfortunately, everyone seems to found that out and finding parking places can be very challenging (four rating).  It almost feels like it is being loved to death in some spots.  Nonetheless, if you can get to key destinations early or go off the beaten path, you will be rewarded."
Beauty beyond expectation,"My wife and I spent three days touring the park.  The second day was rain and fog, providing an enchanted take on the natural beauty.  The last day was bright and sunny.  Repeating the circuit trip of day two provided a totally different perspective with equal beauty.  I must say that the sun brought out all those too timid to tolerate the rain, so the sunny day was a bit crowded."
Worth Every Minute,"Friends and family who recommended this to us were not exaggerating. Acadia National Park has some of the best views in the North East. The only sandy beach we know of Down- East. The drive/hike along the peninsula has several amazing outlooks, all different. (Several are handicap accessible). Bring binoculars and watch the haws, perhaps a bold eagle or the waves. You can drive to the top of Cadillac Mountain where there is a gift shop and restrooms. Get an early start for parking."
"Has it all-oceans, mountains, lakes, trails!","Acadia is the most amazingly beautiful national park! It has it all from ocean beaches, mountains to climb, lakes to enjoy, trails to explore. It offers many options so that regardless of your physical abilities, there are places and trails to explore and enjoy. I really loved I could climb my first mountain.  We meet some great people along the way from all over the US and other parts of the world. The park staff are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. Great vacation and plan to be back again, and again and again!"
What a treasure!,First time experience and it is pristine.  We especially loved seeing the sunrise on Cadillac Mtn and the trail around the pond.  We would hike in the early morning hours and you would hardly pass another soul. So quiet you could listen to the water lapping.  Great trip for all ages.
Put this on your bucket list,"Acadia is absolutely beautiful! We hiked numerous trails in the park, went to scenic outlook spots, and enjoyed watching the waves crash against the shoreline. I am so glad my husband and I came here we made numerous memories that will never be forgotten."
Beautiful!,Highly reccomend the drive up Cadillac Mountain and the ferry to Schoodic Point.  Wow stuff .... Beautiful waves crashing against the granite boulders.
Stunning views,"The park has stunning views of the ocean, cliffs and awesome hiking trails. If we lived in the area we would frequent this park. Only wish it wouldn’t have rained for an entire day that we planned on being in the area. The hiking trails have stunning views, we also choose a horse carriage ride. ( had wanted to rent bikes to ride on the carriage roads but do to surgery we had to change plans) this was a great option to see the carriage roads and learn about the history of the park."
Don't miss this one!,"If you are planning a trip to Maine, don't miss out on the beautiful national park! The shoreline views were stunning! Trails are well kept and gorgeous. You can bike or drive all over it too but be warned if you bike, it's very hilly. Parking can be a challenge and we visited on a very busy week but with a bit of patience, we were able to park everywhere we wanted as cars are always coming and going. You can also take the free bus from Bar Harbor and hop on or off. We are Floridians (aka flatlanders) in our 60's but we enjoyed the shoreline hike and the Jordan Pond hike, both relatively flat and just beautiful! Plan ahead and make reservations at the Pond House after your hike! We challenged ourselves with the Great Head Trail, a lot of which is uphill over boulders. It was hard for us but SO worth it! Do it if you're able. There are tons of others of varying intensity and at least drive up Cadillac Mountain for the views. Hats off to the bicyclists pedaling up the mountain!!"
"Rugged coastline, beautiful lakes, nice hiking, gorgeous sunrise","Our family of four (boys ages 12 and 14) spent two days exploring the park; wish we had allotted at least one more day to be able to see a bit more. The first night we arrived, we did the two mile loop hike from Bubbles parking lot (we were able to get a parking space at 5:45 pm) using Split Bubble trail to Jordan Pond Shore Trail to South Bubble Trail, including the spur to see Bubble rock - this took us a little under two hours with lots of picture stops and time to skip rocks in Jordan Pond. Saw a beaver dam and the swimming beaver in Jordan Pond. The next day we drove to the summit of Cadillac Mountain for sunrise (it gets crowded, so suggest arriving at least 45 minutes before official sunrise time to get closer parking and to find a good spot to watch). Hang out for a bit after sunrise to enjoy the view and let some of the traffic get off the mountain. Then, we did the 1 mile Bar Island trail out and back and spent some time skipping rocks and exploring the tide pools at low tide from downtown Bar Harbor (check the tide tables, as you can only go to Bar Island for the three hours centered around a low tide). The last day, we got to Sand Beach parking at 8:30 am (the lot was full around 8:45 am) and did approximately a five mile loop starting on Bowl Trail to Gorham Mountain Trial to Shore Trail (out to Otter Cliffs then back to Sand Beach). This took about 3:15 hours, with several stops for drinking water, taking pictures, scrambling on the rocks, watching Thunder Hole, watching rappelling, and admiring the views of Sand Beach, Otter Cliffs and the surrounding areas from the top of the mountain. When we arrived back at Sand Beach at Noon, parking stretched along the road for a long way. We changed into bathing suits and enjoyed the beach and had snacks. The water is beautiful but cold, probably 60 degrees. There is not much shade near the beach.  The beach does have changing rooms, bathrooms, water fountain, water bottle filling station, and foot rinsing. We then continued along Park Loop Road to Jordan Pond house, but after several passes were unable to get a parking space, so decided to head off the loop along Route 3 to see the gatehouse, then parked in the Upper Hadlock Pond parking lot and did about a 2 mile hike along two carriage roads (intersections 12 and 13) connected by a hiking path, seeing 3 bridges and a small waterfall. There were carriage road maps at the information kiosk at the parking lot. Be aware that there is no cell signal at Jordan Pond House - we got separated while our driver looked for parking, so had no way to communicate when to reconnect. But, we did have signal in most of the other areas of the park. We used the REI app on our hikes, and we had purchased a hiking book that we used to decide which hikes to do. We also visited Hulls Cove Visitor Center to get our passport stamps, visit the gift shop, and get information - very helpful staff there. We had pre-purchased our 7 day park pass ($30 for a vehicle) online before our arrival, which proved useful since we arrived at ANP after the Thompson Island Information Center had closed (5:00 pm). Note that if you are going through Freeport on your way to Arcadia, the LLBean store sells the park passes. We spent three nights in Bar Harbor at the Villager Motel (good location and value compared to other Bar Harbor Hotels) and spent time exploring Bar Harbor - eating at Blaze, Jordan's, Rosalie's, and the Side Street Cafe plus multiple visits to CJs Big Dipper Ice Cream. We enjoyed the July 4th parade and fireworks in Bar Harbor. The only tour we did during our visit was Diver Ed's Dive In Theater from Bar Harbor, which we highly recommend especially if you are traveling with elementary school kids."
Beautiful place - great for hiking,"The trick to Acadia is to figure out where to park outside the park to get to the trails you want to get to inside the park.  We purchased the week pass ahead of time but when we got to the park it was just way too crowded and not enough parking - this was a week after labor day - so hate to see what it is like in the Summer.  Then we bought a little guide book that showed where all the trails were, how they were connected and where to park outside the park.  There is a tremendous range of hiking from very easy carriage roads for long easy walks (or bike rides) to very steep climbing paths.  The scenery of course is beautiful - and Cadillac Mountain view does not disappoint.  Would to have liked to see some Eagles or more animals/birds in general.  Turns out you need to take a nature cruise to some of the islands to see that."
Very Good Experience. Except for one small detail,"This may have been the most beautiful places I have ever seen. We climbed the Beehive trail, Acadia trail, Jordans pond, and Beach mountain trail. On beach mnt trail I slipped on a wet rock and broke my arm.....in no way can I use this as a strike against my experience here, this is a giant slab of granite and things like this happen."
Breathtaking ,We have wanted to come here for so long. The coast of Maine in rocky and wild unlike where we live in Southern California. The park is so well laid out and the free bus transportation is just awesome. You can go anywhere you want and don’t need to drive unless it’s in the evening. This seems like a good time of year to visit; less crowds and mild weather. A must see.
What can one say - Beautiful,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!   Didn't have enough time so we will be back!  We only had time for one trail.  A must is getting up early and seeing sun rise on top of Cadillac Mt.
So much to see and be impressed by natural beauty,"It is easy to see the care and decades of planning that went into making this magnificent park so enjoyable. All of the roads, such as the Loop, drive up to Cadillac Mountain Summit are extremely well paved and smooth. Trails are well marked, Ocean Paths were made to hear and see the coves, sea, and even provide shade on a sunny day. We were thoroughly impressed."
Breathtaking,"loved everything about this park.....Pond Lake House restaurant had great menu, popovers were amazing......we were lucky had a clear day and top of Cadillac Mtn was amazing...."
incredible,"Beautiful, awe-inspiring, one of the country's great treasures. Whether you just stop at 3 or 4 overlooks, or walk some of the many trails, do not miss!"
Great Scenery,"The park is full of interesting scenery, full of lakes, mountains, and sea views. The trails range from difficult to relaxing, so check a guide book. Parking in certain popular areas can be difficult, so an early start is a good idea."
One of Mother Natures most beautiful places,Thanks to the unselfish generosity of past generations we have this magnificent park to enjoy today!  Spectacular view terrain varying from steep and mountainous to beach fronts.
The tour,"We had a nice tour by car around the park whicj costed $30and is around 30miles. A lot of good spot for nice views were you can stop the car and takes photos. We also drove up to Vadillac mountain which is the really nice view. We did not have a real camera unfortunately as views like this is impossible to catch with a mobile. A nice trip aand it took us some hours, I would assume it could be very crowded in high season."
