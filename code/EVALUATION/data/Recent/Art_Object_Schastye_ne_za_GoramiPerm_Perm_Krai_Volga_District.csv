Gorgeously located on the river bank,"This sign as written is located on the river bank and is a great place for photos and going for a stroll with friends. You have find food, drinks etc. all not far away. Worth a visit"
Great idea,"A great town sign with a great message. Nice and bright, and must be even nicer in the summer with the reflection of the river."
Cool concept! ,"It seems that they fixed and it in fine condition.  You have to arround the construction site of the renovations of the old river station,  but I think it's worth it!   Positive phrase with the great view of the Kama River behind anf on the to side the bank of the old river station.  It well worth a visit combined with a nicecwalk along the river bank. (even in the snow!) …"
Happiness is not far away,"СЧАСТЬЕ НЕ ЗА ГОРАМИ (Schast'e ne za gorami) is the Russian idiom for ""Happiness is not far away"". It is cool to have such a positive vibe in the city's mood, it is very nice to see the phrase at the ens of the promenade along the embankment!   But as for the spring 2015 this art object needs to be repaired a bit. We walked on it just to see the first letter was missing. What a shame Perm does not look after its ""Happiness"" =) Luckily, two lads, walking around found the missing ""C"" and put it in the beginning of the phrase. The ""Happiness"" was saved!  I'm sure, ""Happiness"" looks better in summer, in the sunset... well, I'll return one day to check, meanwhile I'm satisfied with what I saw one sunny April afternoon.…"
An ok place,This was the only place I visited in Perm. It's a ritual among Russians to visit this place and take photos in front of this sign. I did not see any other foreigner here.
