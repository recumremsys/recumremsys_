BLUE IS GREAT PLACE,Went there with friends and it was awesome the water is so cold and nice. i had alot of fun and i would really go there again for sure.
Nico ,My boyfriend and I went to the blue hole and the water was so blue and beautiful. Our tour guide was Nico. He was really cool and made us feel safe. We got a lot of nice pictures and videos of us jumping in each lagoon as well. The waterfall was a little scary at first but definitely a dope experience. Thank god we know how to swim haha
So much fun!,"Visited sept 2020, only maybe 6 other people here during our visit. Such a beautiful place and so much more to it than the main first pool you arrive to! A guide takes you up through all the other pools/waterfalls and there are loads of jumps to do, big and small! I managed to jump off a jump higher than I expected to, had an amazing fun time! The guide was great, helped us take loads of photos with our go pro. Probably my favourite excursion we did in jamaica! Highly recommend!"
Must Do,Awesome place to visit. lots of locals cool inexpensive thing to do. can be a little physical. Kids loved it.
Awesome Water Attraction,Awesome Experience. Glad I got to experience it after the government lifted the Covid ban. Water is truly blue. Cool and fresh. Would recommend this awesome water attraction!
So fun,"So much fun, water was beautiful and warm. Water shoes a must. Swing from ropes, or jump off the tall falls. If you’re brave enough"
Girls Trip,"Everything was pretty dead after covid so not alot of excursions where up and running from the hotel. We got lucky and met Mr. Devroy, he is a licensed independent driver w.a clean car and excellent knowledge of the area, he seriously made this trip amazing. He knew all the hot spots and drove us anywhere we wanted to go. With very competitive rates I will never do hotel shuttle tour again, having your own driver gives you freedom to come and go at whatever time you wish. Contact Mr. Devroy aka Mr. Seemore Payless when in Jamaica 876-432-1785 tell him San Diego sent you :)!!!!"
Blue Hole is a Must See,The Blue Hole experience is a must for anyone who travels to Ocho Rios. Our guide was excellent and very accommodating for those of us in the group who are not swimmers. So beautiful!
Beware at the Blue Hole,Unfortunately the grounds haven’t been maintained. You will find trash every where you look. Safety isn’t a priority. The guide grabbed my 8 year old and walked him up a waterfall. It was like the wild Wild West!
Beautiful,The water was so beautiful. The hike was very fun. The tour guides were awesome. We enjoyed the waterfalls.
Magical!,"This place is truly indescribable. It’s what I imagine heaven to look like! We went early in the morning so pretty much had the place to ourselves for at least an hour. Our guides were amazing encouraged us to take advantage of all we came to Jamaica to do. They were extremely helpful and kind. Be prepared for some serious swimming if you plan to jump off the rocks. Water shoes are a must, as well as maybe some bug spray because I got bit up pretty bad. The hike was also very serene as we reached a beautiful waterfall with natural clay inside. My experience was life changing!"
Visit them!! U won't be disappointed!!,I'm a water lover and this was by far one of my best experiences ever! It is now one of my favourite river/water fall. Our tour guide Mickey was very professional and ensured we got the full experience. It is also very affordable for locals! Dunns River has nothing on Blue Hole trust me! This needs to be the most highlighted spot in St. Ann!
Incredible experience! Will be returning!,"We had a phenomenal trip to Cool Blue Hole. Water was refreshing and the location was beautiful and shaded. Lloyd was one of the best tour guides we’ve ever had! He took us to each spot, took pictures/videos, and made us feel safe the entire way. Would recommend this excursion to anyone."
Amazing! A must experience.,This place was definitely worth the trip. Had a great tour bus driver with great locals explaining the culture and showing us the beautiful landscape. They were very helpful with kids and making us feel safe!
Fantastic experience!,"Would definitely recommend this trip!! The guide we had was absolutely amazing, so so kind and gave us such a fantastic experience! I can't applaud him enough for how good he was with us, offering to take my camera on multiple occasions to film us doing the several occasions - really meant a lot! The trip comprises of swimming in the beautiful waters as well as the options to do some jumping, rope swings and cave climbing! Fantastic experience!"
So much fun !!!,"Blue hole was awesome, I jumped off the cliffs and swam in the water. It was so refreshing. I will definitely go here when I return to Ocho Rios. I took a group of 18 we had a great time."
Friends outing,The place to swim and chill. It's a long drive up the hill but it's worth it. I learn how to swing on the rope look.
Unexpected delight.,"Guide was fantastic, no spring chicken myself or my husband but guide made it safe and possible to enjoy. No idea where we were going as this jaunt was included in the Mystic Mountain package. Amazing."
One of the best experiences I've ever had!,"Beautiful rain forest and excellent staff! The area is breathtaking full of waterfalls, springs, caves, and natural mud. It was so much fun to explore the rainforest and the tour guides were amazing. They make sure you are safe on the trails and they carry on good convo. They…"
"Trash everywhere, Very Sketchy","Visited here with our 3 teenage kids - VERY DISAPPOINTED!  it was a very rough, sketchy 15-minute walk through the woods which had trash and debris laying everywhere, and shantys in the woods where people were selling  drugs and alcohol.  There was a blown up shack that appeared…"
Trip highlight - skip Dunn's River,"My wife and I had an amazing time at Blue Hole. It's about 30 minutes from Tower Isle and is not in the same direction as Dunn's River. Note, everything is cash only. Admission was $1800 JMD each and there was no one else in our group. Locker was $2 USD. Our tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and obligingly took pictures and video for us with our own cameras. He pointed out plants, helped us with the route, and encouraged us to do all the water jumps, of which there are about 6, all of varying heights. I tipped him $3000 JMD because I was so pleasantly impressed after Dunn's River the previous day, and he helped us get a ride back to Tower Isle when our original driver didn't pick up the phone. Overall would definitely do again!!!"
Unique Oasis,"Visited this amazing site with my husband and am so glad we did. Unlike most places, the pictures did not do it justice. The clear water was so incredibly refreshing. This is a beautiful site that I can’t quite stress enough....if you go to Jamaica....GO HERE.The staff are knowledgable and helpful for keeping your footing, sometimes the lifeguards put on a good show of their own jumps and there are many different options for jumping, wading and dipping into the water. No one is pushy and the trail systems are easy to follow to ensure you see the many different levels and layers of the Blue Hole. You climb to the top and can progressively jump each level or walk back down. There are many different pools of water, all beautiful, clear and refreshing.Highly recommend!"
Best activity for the active person. One of the best deals for an attraction,"As a child growing up in  central Jamaica, Dunn's River falls was the best part of a family vacation to the North Coast. As lovely as Dunn's River is, if you can swim, Blue Hole is better. Even if you can't swim, lifejackets are available. Our guide Ryan was a friendly and personable young man who was as professional as he was outgoing. After signing waivers and donning bathing suits and water shoes, there was a short walk to the first pool of deep blue water. We jumped off into the refreshing water from around 3 metres above. We then swam to the edge and repeated the exercise from a different side of the pond. This time swinging off a rope like Tarzan! We then swam under the small waterfall into a cave where a scene from Dr. No was filmed in the 1960's. Very cool. The trek  to the big waterfall, through the vegetation up a hill was approximately 10 mins over a few areas where you had to navigate uneven steps partially carved by nature. Once there, a beautiful pond at the bottom of a waterfall and a man made diving platform at least 5 metres high, awaited our inner daredevils. We swam over to the falls and climbed stairs to get to the top of the falls. Ryan then took each of us by the arm gently and walked us down the face of the falls to a point where we, each in turn jumped off into the pool. Huge adrenaline rush! Swimming back to the same side as before, we again climb up the stairs and jumped off the tower into the pool. We were exhausted but we had the biggest smiles on the way back to the car. There are change rooms and restrooms on location. Bring your own snacks or buy some from the vendors on site."
Beautiful Place,Even though I didn’t jump/swim in this beautiful place. Just watching was peaceful  and serene I could just be here all day.
More than 3 hrs from Negril and worth every penny,"Good price, great staff (guides, please tip them well) Couple hours of great fun with very friendly and helpful guides who really look out for our well being. Thrilling jumps from different height to multiple water pools. Including jump from hanging rope. Photos can be taken by the guides for extra fee. Really worth it."
"So much fun, and beautiful, too","We contacted Winston Gayle of TourJamaicaToday.com, and explained we were on a cruise and had 1 day in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.  We explained we didn't want to hit all the ""tourist"" hot spots, so he recommended Blue Hole instead of Dunn's Falls.  And we were so thrilled with this place.  Beautiful water, falls, foliage and Little T was such a fun guide.  Since the 3 out of the 4 of us who went are over 70 years of age, I told Winston we probably wouldn't be jumping off the platform or diving or anything too adventuresome.  But once we arrived, we quickly changed our minds and jumped, and swam, and had a blast!  Beautiful location and not crowded with tourists!!"
We enjoyed it a lot,"Went there during our stay at Ocho Rios and really enjoyed it. I'd say, this would be a nice trip for a family, too, since the jumps and the water was brilliant."
Minnesotans at Blue Hole,"This was such a great family experience! Very affordable and staff was outstanding, beautiful water, big jumps. Our guide Val was awesome!"
Amazing Family Experience,We had an AMAZING time! A quick tour but well worth it! The guides were GREAT and took great care of us climbing the rocks and making sure we didn’t hurt ourselves on the jumps. This is a MUST DO while in Jamaica
Just JUMP!,Blue hole is AMAZING! You must visit if you are in Ocho Rios. My only regret is not jumping off the cliffs. Next time I am putting on a life vest and jumping!!
Beautiful,This is a must see and do in Jamaica. Take water shoes and money for tipping the guide. If your scared of heights you won’t like the cliff jumping into the water.
Quite Possibly the Coolest Thing I've Ever Done,"Although I've had many travel experiences, the day I spent here at the Blue Hole is undoubtedly one of my very favorite. We rented a car and went up on our own, which was an exhausting drive. but 100% worth it. I can't recommend this enough! We didn't set foot in the ocean while in Jamaica since we lived in Cuba at the time and most of us were freshwater fans, so this was the perfect experience!"
Fun loving trustworthy guides - series of amazing falls and pools!,"Not easy to find if you are driving (like we did) but well worth the effort!  Recommend hiring guide once you reach what they now call Nature Blue.  They will help you navigate the traversing series of falls, filming you every step of the way as you swim against waterfall to reach mineral mud cave :)  then once reaching top - you get to jump down into each deep turquoise pool to make your way down to rope swing and little bars and restaurants and beginning again!  VERY Jamaican experience, so dont be offended by a little herbal medicine displayed...Was one of the best waterfall experience out of 4 we experienced while in Jamaica!"
Refreshing!,"Recently had the opportunity to go tubing, ziplining and swimming here and it was absolutely amazing!!  The tour guides were awesome (Big Snack/Marley). The guides truly love what they do and enjoy making your day the best!"
EXCELLENT,"The Blue Hole or as the english refer to this GREAT Wonder ""The Blue Lagoon"" Is one of Jamaica's great treasures - OUTSTANDING - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Respect Mon!,"We all had just finished conquering the Dunn’s River Fall's as a team/group. I believe there was some bonding. Now was the time that I had made up in my mind that I was going to conquer my fear of heights. Daniel and Andre were great guides. And as we came to our last jump, the highest, Less people were willing to participate. The four that you see in the pic, which includes me, were the only jumpers. Little did I know u til afterwards that our guide Andre was hoping that I would go ahead. See I first said yes and then paused. He was patient and had experienced many people talking themselves through it. He respected me and I respected him as well as the others that went before me on this jump in the pic. Some even went twice. Thank you gentlemen as well as my fellow jumpers! RESPECT!"
blue hole in ocho rios,excellent guides that help you to the falls and blue hole.   the trail in unsteady  and uneven. so wear sturdy shoes    the guides allow time  for you to wade in the water  as you go and you can go at your own pace....its a great experience and I highly recommend it...
LOVED the Blue Hole!,We had a group of 11 people -- we loved the experience and the culture.   The water was gorgeous -- lush plants and a cool dirt path.   Our guide was very nice and attentive.  It was so much fun!  Definitely put this one on your list.  It was not as commercialized as Dunn's River Falls (which we enjoyed) --- a true cultural experience!
Great Excursion/Beautiful Place,"My husband and I wanted to take our 18 year old daughter to some place other than Dunns River Falls. Although it's been 13 years since we were there, we probably won't go back. The Blue Hole was much better. I am so thankful that we went there. My husband and daughter were able to jump off the small cliffs and had a blast. Even though I didn't go in the water, I was able to travel around and take pictures. We did not have water shoes so if we went back, it would be a must. It was so beautiful there and our tour guide was great! I would definitely go back!"
Favorite part of Jamaica,"Highlight of our day in Ocho Rios.  If you can get Javier, he is the best guide ever.I had surgery on my toes and he was so helpful and mindful of my feet as we climbed the side of the falls and chose easier jumping spots for me.  The rest of our group (5 couples) loved jumping off the high platforms and tall waterfalls.  He showed us howto swim to the underwater cave.  He had a great photographer take really superb shots of us as couples and individuals with good action shots."
Visit to Blue Hole-Ocho Rios-Jamaica,"On JANUARY of this year I made a quick trip to my home town of Jamaica and I had the opportunity of visitingJamaica. I visited  St. Ann, my garden parish where I was born.I visited Ocho Rios, my favourite Hot spot forThe Famous Jerk Chicken, Goat Soup , Steamed and Fried Fish, which are my favorite dishes.My stay was short, a business trip but it was very pleasant; seeing my old friends and enjoying the Famous Dunn's River Falls.It was very relaxing, drinking a lot of Coconut Water; which was refreshing. I had a few dips in the Ocean andclimbing the Falls to complete my short stay. It was so delightful to be back home, enjoying the beautiful climate and swimming in the clear blue ocean..My time was very short and I am looking forward very soon tovisit again.I encourage anyone who wishes to visit Jamaica to make Ocho Rios one of their sight seeing trip.Man, they willlove it.Jamaica is for Fun, vacation, business,tours, site seeing,But, don't  forget to visit the Dunn's River Falls.Enjoy Jamaica and have lots of fun."
Beautiful,"I was very skeptical at first because of the climbing (my knees are not the best), but once we reached the destination and learned the history of it, I was in aww.  Definitely recommended when in Ocho Rios."
Fun Tour ,"Fun tour, only lasts about 90 minutes though. Jumping into the water from high up with the waterfall in the background is awesome. I'd suggest booking this with something else, we did Mystic mountain as well and this meant we got a full day out. Take a waterproof camera or gopro with you. There are no lockers!"
Javier at the Blue Hole,"My in-laws and my husband and I did a tour with Javier and I cannot say enough good things about the experience! My mother-in-law is not in the best of health and very unsteady on her feet. Javier literally held her hand the entire way and are her feel so special and safe. He was hilarious, a really nice guy, and made the whole thing so much fun for us. It was the highlight of our trip for sure. Thanks again Javier!"
Beautiful,This attraction was so amazing. The water was beautiful. I liked that there were people there to take pictures for us but I felt a bit rushed going through it.
Hidden Gem in Jamaica - Blue Hole,"The Blue Hole is located in Jamaica's White River Valley.  It is located between St Ann and Sr Mary's parishes.  If you take a taxi from the Ocho Rios cruise port, expect approximately a 20 minute drive.  The Blue Hole creates cascades of waterfalls approx. 20-25 feet.  It is a great excursion for swimmers, hikers and thrill seekers.  Plan on wearing swimwear and water shoes.  It would be a good idea to also bring a towel and a waterproof phone pouch so you can capture some great pictures.  Lockers are available for an extra cost.  Park entrance fee is $20 American dollars per adult.  We were told that we needed a guide to walk us through the area and we tipped him a few dollars per person."
Excellent Adventure,"Our family of 5 had a great time at the Blue Hole outside Ocho Rios.  The grotto behind the falls was unexpected and fun but not as much as the climb up the tunnel to the mud cave further up.  You definitely need to be no larger than average size to go through the tunnel and also not be claustrophobic.  The jump from the platform was an exhilarating.We gave our guide US $10 per person which seemed fair and reasonable.   Overall, a fun excursion that I would definitely recommend."
pretty water,"first was told 2 different prices for tour. then i wasnt allowed to take any water with me cause they sell it at the pools and will follow you to the car for payment.  very slippery and slidey to get there, anymore rain and i couldnt have walked in to the pools. pretty good for 15$ each"
Place is ok,"So I have a little mix feeling about this place, reason is the place it self is amazing! Beautiful little gem tucked away from the bustling of the town........buuuuuut the people there makes it hard for me to say I would go back! First when we arrived, the two ladies at the front was arguing in front of us because each want our sale from those dirty shoes they were renting/selling. That was a turn off, no need to argue in front of us. Second everyone trying to sell us something and they don’t want to take no thank you as an answer,  we came here for the falls/water!!!! Not to spend the day buying unnecessary items that’s over priced! Oh before I forget the guy that sells the jerk chicken was very friendly, not pushy and gave good customer service. There was also one guy about half way the journey selling cold beer from an igloo he was very approachable and his mannerism caused my husband to stop and buy a beer from him although hubby really didn’t want a beer. Now back to the negative, one of the tour guides was hinting to us that we need to take care of the guide we were using and at first I didn’t understand what he was trying to say until he said it out loud to tip the guide well. I was taken aback because I thought tipping was based on the customers discretion and to even be brining that up before we even had a chance to settle was a big turn off! Then when we got back I gave the guide a tip, based on what I thought was reasonable but I guess since I gave the guide (William) in local money he wasn’t pleased or maybe he was hoping for thousands of dollars he was upset and right in front of my husband he started cursing that we were the worst people he ever guide. The guy he was speaking with walked away but that impression William gave us is the number one reason I would never return. It would have been better if he had asked for more money than to be cursing. I planned to take my friends there in December when I visit but honestly I’d rather go back to Dunn’s river because in all the time I’ve gone there I’ve never experienced that with a staff!"
Fun after Dunn’s River,"We booked a day trip to Dunn’s River and the Blue Hole through Best Jamaica (Highly recommend them). It was fun to stop at the Blue Hole after Dunn’s River to check it out and go for a swim. The water was chilly, but refreshing. Jumping off of the rocks into the Blue Hole was exhiker. They have employees that will give you river tours. Don’t forget to tip them."
Beautiful,"I didnt read much  into the blue hole before going and was surprised at how much fun i had. Here you enjoy a small hike up a river and then cliff jump and tarzan swing your self back down to the bottom, We split the day between here and Dunns River and had a blast."
Must do if you visit Jamaica,"We had a fantastic time, our guide Lloyd was fantastic, very helpful, let us take our time and enjoy both Island Gully Falls and the blue hole, we were not rushed at all, he took at least 100 photos on our phones and we each did 10-15 jumps.  Tip: Research ahead of time and Go when cruise ships are not in port - we were pretty much the only ones there"
Great place,"This is an awesome place to visit, the guys working here make your visit very exciting and safe, I will return."
Great water hole,"We had a fantastic experience at the Blue Hole. The walk up was easy and the water clear and not cold, just refreshing. Our guide was helpful in ensuring we crossed easily, the rocks are not slippery but the water runs fast at some points. The jumps were great. There is one high jump that is optional. My husband who is not a fan of heights did it. I jumped from a lower point. The water is deep so no problem getting hurt, just hold your nose!"
Best guide!,"My bf and i recently did the blue hole and we had the best time!! Our guide ariel was super funny, knowledgeable, safe and friendly. We had a blast. Highly recommend! Way better then dunns river falls!! If u go to jamrock... Check them out!"
definitely a must-do when you´re in OR,"this was one of the best experiences I´ve had.I would recommend a private driver to get there as the road is quite hilly and narrow.The best time to go there is straight in the morning before the masses arrive so you have the place almost for yourself and your guide.Pure nature, cold water but after jumping in it´s just delicious."
Best Excursion Ever!,"This is a must.  Our guides: Dwight, Jeff (Bus driver), Warren, and Courtney deserve raises.  They were so attentive and knowledgeable.  We were thoroughly impressed and enjoyed every minute.We recommend going to Blue Hoke if you ever make it to Jamaica and book it with Chukka."
Mrs Arthurs Moulton,"You have to be a daredevil, but a fun activity you have to experience..clear fresh water, experienced guides. Lots of great photos."
Got there early,"We got there early and when we were leaving it was looking to get a lot busier, not sure it would be very good with crowds of people.The drive to and from is an adventure in itself.You don't need closed-toe shoes. If you buy the water shoes they are pitching, they have them for $10 at Mystic mountain booth, but the lady we stopped at out of her car was $15.A few places to jump off, nothing too big. There's a cave you can go into and a waterfall you can swim under into a small opening. There's a rope swing too.A guy is selling beers and joints in the middle. A clip, towels or something would be handy with all the wet hands."
Omar,"The blue hole is a lot of fun especially if you are a thrill seeker and like to do cliff jumping, Omar was our tour guide he absolutely made me and my husband feel super special, he took many pictures along the way of our adventure, highly recommend Omar for your tour guide he is the best"
Blue Home excursion ,Niko and Coco are the BEST guides.... book through Genius Reggae Jamaica Tours and she will hook you up!
Fantastic day better than Dunn’s,"We had an amazing time, book it yourself only 15 dollars on the door and we got a taxi from the gates of the Riu for 5 dollars each, 4 sharing a taxi. You definitely need a guide we had Romie he was wonderful and very caring. You need sea shoes and for the ladies a swimsuit is best rather than a bikini. There are lockers to put your valuables in. But I left my watch and rings in the hotel safe. It’s good if you have a water proof case for your phone so you can take photos. You can buy food and drink on the way round you pay you guide for them at the end. Sea shoes are a must. It’s quite sheltered so you are not in direct sun. I would say it’s not suitable for young children."
Dr. Fun and Javier made for a great experience!,"We enjoyed our driver Harry Lee Johnson so much with Dr. Fun so much, we requested him on our Blue Hole excursion. Harry is a fun, genuine guy who really watches out for your and is very knowledgeable. Dr. Fun made sure to arrange our trip through the Blue Hole with Javier. We are an adventurous couple, and he made sure we were safe and well taken care of, while setting up for special moments and exciting times. Would definitely recommend Javier at the Blue Hole and Dr. Fun for your tours"
Rushed. Freezing water!,"I was very disappointed with this excursion.From time we got there till time we left it was 15 minutes.The water was freezing not even enjoyable.Our guide rushed us through, and then said we had to tip him at least 20 US dollars at the end.He only took one picture. I wanted more time to enjoy the nature and beauty of the whole not necessarily jumping into freezing water.It sounds like Others had a way better experience. Maybe it was just the guide we got :( But it was definitely not worth the money and the tip for 15 minutes."
Beautiful Water Fall,Great experience here - our guide was absolutely the kindest young man I have ever met.  So caring and mindful of our safety as we hiked to the upper falls.Not impressed with the loud music and multiple vendors - sort of ruined the feel of thebeautiful jungle - might be good if they could put all of the sales itemsin one area.  A beautiful place to see.
Blue hole is a must see!!!,We loved this attraction and highly recommend it to all. My husband & I had been to Dunn’s River and both agreed that the blue hole is where it’s at! We ❤️Jamaica!!!
Great experience ,"Took my Mum to Jamaica for her 70th birthday and booked Blue Hole experience for the two of us. We both loved it, my mum had a great time jumping off the swing (yes, she's 70) and swimming in the cool, refreshing water, getting a clay massage and overall care of our guide Ryan, who was very attentive and fun. The only thing that spoiled the experience a little bit - as in all these ""experiences"" and trips - is when your guide starts to tell you how they don't get paid and how you should take care of them. Of course we were going to tip him, the ""friendly reminder"" was unnecessary but it does put a damper on things."
Island Gully Falls - Best of Ocho Rios Tour,"We enjoyed the Blue Hole - apparently there are several companies and locations in the same area - we went to Island Gully Falls at the end of the road. The guides were fantastic - they helped us across the top of the falls, and were very careful with us, but they were quite daring themselves. My cellphone came off as I was jumping in, and the guide dove down and retrieved it. We went as part of the Best of Ocho Rios Tour - booked through Sandals, but I'm sure it's cheaper to book directly through the company. Admission to the site is $15 per day, so get a local guide and enjoy!"
Blue Hole,Awesome must do while in Jamaica. Thank you neal for being the best guide ever. A lot less people you truly enjoy the time there. Its a hidden jem.
One of the most beautiful areas I have seen,"Fantastic! They will gear your experience to your comfort level. If you are anywhere in Jamaica, I would try to make it over to this area. Will be a bit of a drive up some skinny roads...totally worth the effort."
My 6 and 9 year old loved it!!!,We had a great time at the Blue Hole!! My kids loved it!! It was definitely one of the highlights on our trip to Jamaica!!
It was still fun!,We were unable to swim because it had rained hard the day before and the water was brown - this is for your safety that they close the hole!!!. The lifeguard still took us for a ‘dry tour’ for half price upon entry. Lots of climbing beautiful paths and scenic little waterfalls. Would be a sight to see if the water was clear!!
Blue hole,Hope you’re not scared of Heights. If not then I would highly recommend this attraction. The ride in is a little bumpy but well worth it being up in the mountains of beautiful Jamaica. The water is crystal clear and the waterfalls are majestic it’s a must see.
Loved it!,"We were a group of 20+ (mostly Americans) and we were dealt with politely, treated well and instructed on how to enjoy the river in a fun way while being safe at the same time."
"Wonderful, not life changing",This is an amazing excursion and it is worth the money and time but don’t book through the cruise and don’t think you have to do this. It is great and beautiful and fun but I wouldn’t feel incomplete if I hadn’t done it either. If you book then do so through somewhere like ShoreExcursions.com because you will be with the cruise people but you will save about $80 per person. To sum it up: go if you want to and you will enjoy it but there are also a lot of things just as cool and beautiful that are closer and cheaper.
Great attraction ,"The Blue Hole is a beautiful place and if you love  waterfalls please visit.  It was a hot day and we loved the coolness of the pool.  Our guide was young and really good at leading us over the hazards.  If you are Canadian, you will find it annoying that there are craft vendors along the path although we were okay with it.  The ticketing, parking lot, and path are not to Canadian standards so prepare yourself for that.  Our guide was awesome and we gave him a ten US tip which wiped the smile off his face. We thought it was fair as the price of admission was $40 US for the two of us, so it was 25% which we understood to be fair.  We assumed he was also being paid by the park and if this is not so, I would’ve paid him more. I did research tipping in Jamaica before I left and while I was there and I am still unsure what I should have done."
It’s worth the walk!,"From Moon Palace, Ocho Rios, not a long journey. Good crew running things. Water and settings are stunning. Be prepared for some hiking and stairs.  We did all dives and ropes. Great time."
Wicked,"Loved it here, was natural and a bit of an adventure. All the climbs, stairs made it so much better and interesting. The jumps and caves are really good and even though they are scarey just dont look down and go for it. 🙈. There are several entrances to the blue hole, I went to the first one which has 3 x Jumps.I went with Tranquility Tours (FB) who are based in Tower Isle 10mins from Ocho Rios. Marvin is very knowledgeable and professional,he was friendly and showed us some other local hidden gems and I would always use him for my tour/driving services now. His number is +18764515922"
Carnival Cayman Island Tour,This was an awesome and unexpected experience. The Blue Hole was amazing.  Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and helpful.
First time visit,We visited the Blue Hole with Marvyns tour excursions. Our guide Darrio was amazing and made sure we had a great time. Make sure to wear water shoes. You don't have to jump of you don't want to. Darrio safely guided me to places to enter the water without jumping. Would recommend a visit while in Ochos Rios. Go with Marvyns!
Amazing place,Amazing place to experience the river with some great activities. Also less crowded than Dunn Falls river that become very popular.
Amazing place to swim,"We really enjoyed visiting the blue hole. We were not brave enough to jump, but took the ladder down and was so surprised how beautiful it was there! What a neat place to swim away from the sun. And watching the men jump and do their flips and such was very entertaining. There’s also a pool there you can swim in and a bar. The only thing I didn’t like was there was a guy trying to sell the mud that you rub on your skin to guests. When we said no thanks we will just grab our own when we are down there, he said if we do that we still have to pay for it. Then we felt like we were being watched. If it wasn’t for that I would have given it 5 stars ! If the staff or owner is reading this, tell your guys not to harass guests about the mud. It’s such a turn off!"
What fun this is!,"We had such a wonderful time it was a surprise experience. We did it on a whim at the suggestion of our Tour Jamaica Today tour operator. We didn't do all the jumps but we had a great time. We took a mud bath under the falls. Our tour guides Dillon was absolutely wonderful. He took all of our pictures and made sure we stayed safe. This is cheaper than Dunn's River Falls, and from what I hear it's more fun. Bring water shoes and a towel. They have life vests free of charge."
"Fun trip, but unexpected strenuous hike","The trip was fun- but no one told us about the thirty minute strenuous hike through an uneven rainforest muddy path to get to the swimming spot. The river water was frigid, even in the middle of summer."
Day Trip,Such a relaxing day @ the Blue Hole.  Pool is chemical-free as it is filled with mineral spring water.  Food & Drinks available thou food service can be slow.
Fantastic waterfall,"Such a full filled day. Our guide Nico was great, he made sure we had a great time. This is a must visit site once in Jamaica."
Great family fun!,We chose Konoko Falls and Blue Hole over Dunns River Falls and so glad we did! Konoko Falls was beautiful and peaceful and we learned a lot! Blue Hole was a lot of fun! Your guide carefully brings you to the top of the falls and then you proceed through a series of jumps that take you eventually to the bottom. We all thoroughly enjoyed this stop! Bring tip money. Trust me when I say they deserve every cent!
Gorgeous View! ,I didnt know what to expect but when we arrived I couldn't get enough of the views.  The guides took such good care of us (even carrying the 2 toddlers in our group) so we could focus on the walk and climbing.   One guide took some great pictures and videos for us that I will cherish forever.  Fun place!
Ask for Jafar at Cascade Road!,"Type “Cool Blue Hole” in Google Maps, and go to entry on Cascade Road. As for Jafar. Awesome local guide. We had a blast. What a natural playground. Just beautiful and refreshing, with Reggae tunes and vibe to boot."
So much fun,"You will love this place. The guides their  are the best . They are going to make sure you enjoy your experience and if you feel unsure about anything just trust them . They will get you through it . And that means I was a  chicken poop  who wanted to chicken out from everything,   but they got me through my fear and I’m so glad they did I made it through All of the excursions . Best trip ever . So beautiful their. All of our guides where amazing"
Blue Hole falls adventure,Lovely spot and the guides were very engaging. The ride up provides a good feel of the local culture and rural environment. The photographers worked hard and we got a couple of fun pictures. Worth negotiating on cost of electronic copies!It was a fun group activity
"Absolutely beautiful, and so much fun with a private guide!","We actually visited December 2018 but just took this long to write a review since we're not huge TripAdvisor users. My girlfriend and I came here in the late afternoon and had an absolutely wonderful time. Omar was our own private guide. He took us all the way up to this small dam where we could swim around. Then we basically found all kinds of small waterfalls that we could jump off. Omar also took us through a small limestone cave and to rope swings. He never pressured us to jump off anything if we were scared, but it was so much fun we did it all. He also retrieved us a fresh coconut at the end of the day, which was so refreshing. Overall Omar was fantastic, and I would definitely recommend him as your tour guide. You can explore much more if you have a smaller group or if you're going with just your significant other. Also, if you look at the walkways, you can find his name carved into the cement in several places."
Beautiful and Fun Excursion,"We went to Blue Hole in January of 2020. I went with my boyfriend, and my mom. We combined the trip with Mystic Mountain. We went to Blue Hole first thing in the morning. The water was a beautiful blue, and extremely refreshing! The views were outstanding. First we climbed up the water fall, then made our way down it. The guide was great, we jumped off of many cliffs into deep water, and even did the rope swing! It was a super fun trip, and we would for sure do it again. Don’t forget your water shoes!!! You do need them. If you do forget them, you can purchase them before you get to the hole, they’re sold for $15!"
Awesome,"This was our second time at Blue Hole and it was great again.Our guide was very helpful, especially with the kids (5,7) and we all had a blast. We did all the jumps and had an unforgettable time like last year.Yes, there are many people there but you don't have to wait long anywhere. Last year we were among the first there and it was quiet there. Believe me, Dunn's River Falls is much more crowded and touristy.The water is not crystal clear and a little colder than the ocean, but I loved it."
Amazing!!!!,Cliff diving!!!  What a treat!!!  This is a gem!  You can't go to Jamaica and not participate in this amazing experience!!!
What a time!,"In my opinion, if you are looking for a fun adventure this is a must. I was looking forward to doing this excursion the whole trip, and after my boyfriend and I agreed it was the best part of the whole vacation! A few different places to jump off of, you can walk down a waterfall, rope swing, a great way to spend your day. I hope to be back again soon! The water was a bit chilly so be prepared, but also be prepared for the beautiful blue waters and friendly staff! I bought a waterproof phone pouch at a small vendor on site, and the workers took tonnes of great pictures for us while there, videos too. We brought our own watershoes but i think you could have bought some there as well."
Thank you courtney for an amazing experience,This adventure is a must do for anyone in ocho Rio's beautiful scenery and refreshing water. Best tour guide ever captured some amazing photographs for us and helped me concur the fear of jumping off the falls. Great time had by all.
MUST GO,Our tour guide suggested us going to the Blue Hole and we are so glad that we went!! If you are adventurous then you will love this! Lots of jumping into the water and the guides are incredibly helpful!!!! I do suggest that you bring water shoes or you can buy some there for like $15. If I ever visit Ochos Rios again I will be heading back to the Blue Hole!
December Jamaica Moon Palace,Beautiful fun Amazing trip loved watching the jumps and the guides were great then we went to the river tube trip
It can be a highlight of your trip!!,"We had a large group of 11 that headed up to the Blue Hole.  We really didn't know what to expect, even after reading and seeing pictures, it was different than we had expected.  On this one (vs. Dunn River) I would suggest using a guide.  They are NOT compensated by the group that manages the Blue Hole and from my observations, are all great to work with... tip them appropriately!  ;) This one can be a bit of a hike, but anyone in reasonable condition will be perfectly fine.  It is NOT accessible to those that need additional support (walkers, wheelchairs etc.) as there is a rather involved short hike to the main falls.  Some of the more significant jumps require a bit of physical skill.  Some in our group hiked up, cooled off in the pools and were able to watch all of the action of those that were more ""brave""!!Our guides were awesome and took us on just about every pool, drop, jump, climb, cave etc. that we saw anyone else experiencing.  Some groups did not and my guess is that the guide have a strong idea of what their group is looking for, but I'm sure if there is something that you see that you aren't doing and you ask your guide, they will be happy to bring you through.  (Walking DOWN the main falls, into the cave under the main falls etc.)We felt reasonably safe, but you are on your own.  Be careful and don't be afraid to ask for help.  There is always another way down! ;)We had a photographer with us as well... negotiate for ALL of the photos vs. just one or two... they will start CRAZY high, so start CRAZY Low... you can get some amazing images of a great experience for a reasonable price!Also, I would STRONGLY suggest water shoes.  The guides don't use them, but just like any role, their feet have become accustomed to the hiking, and walking on rocks etc."
Thrilling and Fun!,Had a great experience cliff jumping and pictures to prove it! Our guide was great and allowed us to do multiple jumps and I felt safe the whole time.
The BEST,So much fun!  We had grandparents with and they were able to do it too.Shuttle to get there is interesting but it is worth it!
"Wow - just, WOW!!!!","visited the Blue Hole while on a cruise that stopped in Jamaica. wasn't sure what to expect, thought it would be a bit of a hike and then some small jumps and a swim in the hole. It was SO much more than that!!!! our guide took us up a series of waterfalls that splash into a series of pools. several of the ""cliff"" jumps were small, but there were some pretty big ones as well. it was an absolute riot!!!!"
2nd visit ,Highly recommend visiting Blue Hole it's a complete oasis. Such an adventure.Go along and enjoy it.We went with IRIE boys
A tropical paradise,"The Blue Hole was a day of fabulous scenery, waterfalls and swimming ponds. We swung on ropes over the lagoons, climbed and dove off high platforms and waterfalls and then enjoyed a local bbq of jerk chicken. Highly recommended"
beautiful water!!:),"not so crowded and the water was green. i rope jumped in water. very kool experience! water shoes, life vests are available there for rental."
The Highlight of Jamaica ,"After doing the rafting along White River we drove up to Blue Hole.  It was a little tricky to find but a local who worked up there led the way on his motorcycle and then he gave us the full tour experience and took photos and videos of us too.  If you can ask for Tristan Mitchell, he was amazing and super helpful and encouraging to our teen daughter who was nervous to jump in some of the spots.  This took over an hour and life vests are available if you need.  Water shoes are a must.  Blue Hole is even more beautiful than a Dunn’s River and it has deep water holes to jump or dive into.  Just breathtaking.  It cost $15 USD to get in and you tip your guide anything from $60 to $150 depending on your group size and how much you enjoyed yourself.  There are numerous spots to jump from - your guide will tell you if you need to water bomb, jump feet first or dive, depending on the water depth.  There was also a cave to swim into under a waterfall and give yourself a mud bath and a rope swing to fly off into the water.  This was just so much fun, if you don’t have time for anything else you must do this!!!!"
"Amazing Guide, Beautiful Location",Booked through a cruise excursion that included Mystic Mountain and the Bobsled. Came here first presumably yo avoid the crowds. The guides were super and kept helping everyone up the areas and telling us to take our time. They would even jump with people who were a little scared. They were patient and waited for everyone and a good time was had by all. Bought all the pictures at the end also and they were very good. This place is beautiful and was our favorite part of the entire cruise.
Book through Genius Reggae Jamaica Tours and ask for Kamal,"We came here with my 14 year old daughter on New Year’s Day visiting in port from the Carnival Vista. We pre-booked through Genius Reggae Jamaica Tours. Genius met us and had a personal driver waiting to pick us up right outside the gates of the cruise port. Our driver, Mr. Gibbs drove us to the Blue Hole and introduced us to Kamar upon arrival. Mr. Gibbs waited at the car until our excursion was finished. Kamar took care of getting our wristbands and was our personal tour/lifeguard guide. Kamar stayed with us to make sure we were safe and allowed us to choose what we did or didn’t want to do. He was always right there giving us instructions and assistance navigation and climbing through the rocks and blue holes. Kamar brought out an adventurous side that didn’t exist and took pictures of us with our waterproof camera. We are very thankful for him and the memories we will always remember we made on this day!!!! Thrilling family adventure enjoyed by all!"
Keep Going Up the Road to Island Gulley Instead!,"Island Gulley is a much better waterfall area and is just up the road from the Blue Hole.The guides at the Blue Hole will try to stop you and tell you that you are also at Island Gulley, but keep going until you find the guides with the red shirt and the Island Gulley sign.Island Gulley has multiple waterfalls, multiple jump locations and a rope swing.For a family of 4 (2 teenagers) we paid $60.Of course, they'll take photos along the way and try to sell them to you at the end.  I paid $40 for all the photos - negotiated down from $60.Fun experience"
Amazing!,I would describe this as the #1 must see location in Jamaica.  So beautiful. The only caveats are 1) you need to be comfortable in the water and walking on rocks/bumpy terrain.  So I would definitely say not reco’d for anyone with mobility issues or kids under 4 (we went with a 5yo who is a strong swimmer.  We got a life jacket for him (provided there) and it was totally great.   But I think I would have been uncomfortable if he was much younger and not a decent swimmer.).  2) water shoes (not flip flops) a must.   You need something with soles that will give you some grip on the rocks and in the muddy slippery areas.   Also need to stay on your feet when you jump/swim.   3) bring a waterproof case for your camera/ money.   Don’t bring anything that can’t get wet
"BEACH TRIP,",Had a beach trip with friends and really had a great time no regrets at all.the water was lovely about cold but lovely.had no issues whatsoever so I'll try to visit there again asap.
Beautiful!,Maybe the time of the year but it was quiet it was like your own paradise. You can jump from high or low off the waterfall. Much better then Dunns. We had a nice lunch too. Great day.
Fun,"A kind of water park in a natural environment, really fun! There are many places where you can dive from. Not necessary to take a guide, even if every group do that. Entrance 10 usd. In a couple of hours you do everything."
Awesome ....except for the garbage!,"I have been to Dunn’s Falls but this was way more authenticWe hiked through the jungle, jumped off cliffs, swing on ropes, and swam under waterfallsI loved the entire experience except for the garbage! Everywhere there is garbage left on the trail! To make this a world-class adventure you need to make an effort to clean up the garbage on the trail. Most of it seems to be left by the workers and the local peddlers selling ganja and awesome smelling curries and there is no excuse for thisPlease get your act together on this or people will not come!"
Awesome!,"Beaufitul, authentic, and a great adventure.  Our tour with Jaital was great!  Michael our driver and Bobby our tour guide made it an amazing experience for the whole family.  Lots of jumping from high spots!"
Best time yet!,"We booked the Best of Ocho Rios and had our own personal escort the whole day and one for the Blue Hole which for a first timer to Jamaica, was very reassuring. Our guide Anthony was so kind and generous, we enjoyed his company very much. Our guide Javier at the Blue hole was just as kind and genuinely concerned with our well being. It was a great day."
Wonderful Adventure!,"We took a private tour with Mike WJ Johnson from J Tours.  He drove us to the Blue Hole and recommeded Tyrone to be our guide.  It cost $15 a person and the tour lasted about 2 hours.  I have done Dunns River Falls and Blue Hole was so much more fun!  We walked into the jungle and Tyrone shared with us information about Jamaica and even showed us an Almond Tree.  You will need water shoes to plan on bringing them.  We walked by the water ond over the water and every spot was so amazing.  When we reached the top Tyrone offered to let us jump in the deep water and we did.  It was about a ten foot drop!  So much fun and the water was perfect!  As we went down we had another opprotunity to jump in and at the big falls we could also jump in the beautiful water which was a 15 foot drop, but so much fun!  Lastly, we went to the original Blue Hole area and did a rope swing and went into a small cave.  Every minute was unbelivieable!  Tyrone took our iphone and took some amaizing pictures too!  So much fun!!!"
"The Blue Hole; heart-racing, beautiful, serene and a romantic adventure!","In a word – AMAZING!   We totally loved our Jamaican excursion to the Blue Hole in Ocho Rios.  It was a long ride to the location, traveling from Montego Bay, but our private tour driver, Marlin with Jamaican Tours was a real gem.  He shared a lot of Jamaican history, pointed out different land-marks on the way, and truly entertained us during the drive.  The Blue Hole excursion was far better than what we could have imagined.  Our Blue Hole guide, Dylan was a very big part of the outcome.  I’m very thankful that we were paired with him.  He was patient, thorough and made every attempt to be certain we got most of our experience.  I can’t thank him enough for his support and input. He took great pictures and even videoed our jumps.  I was thankful for the variety of jumps (platform heights), being able to swim in a natural spring pool was very refreshing.  The feel and sound of the rushing waters was so exhilarating.  The entire Blue Hole experience is one for the memory book and by far the best excursion of our Jamaican vacation."
Cash Missing,"I went to the blue hole with my family privately, not with a group of tourists. We locked our towels and valuables, including a wallet, in a locker down by the falls. It seemed a little sketchy (we got there an hour before close so not too many people were there anymore) which is why we recounted the cash in the wallet right when we got back to the locker. Unfortunately it turned out that a significant amount of cash was missing. We did not get the money back, but I just wanted to make sure that you are careful and don’t bring a high amount of cash with you if you plan on leaving it in the lockers. Other than that it was an exciting and fun experience."
"""Photographic Opportunities""",The Blue Hole is a great experience. The guides are very good and take you for a scenic walk around (and for the brave) a walk down the waterfall. Lots of opportunities for photographs and some high jumps into the water.
Amazing time,"We had the best time today at the blue hole. The surroundings were beautiful and our guide Bobby, aka ‘Captain Bobby’ was amazing and was so incredibly patient and wonderful with our kids. Hopefully we can visit again soon!!"
Fun and exciting !,We were led to this waterfall as an alternative to Dunn river falls - perhaps a bit more eco friendly and almost half the entrance fee. We were delighted by this beautiful site where our personal guides led us to jump off numerous cliffs and showed us to a cave under the falls for a mud/mineral scrub. Not for the faint of heart and solid hiking & swimming skills will make this a more enjoyable journey. About 2 hours from Montego Bay.
Best kept secret not for long,Best kept secret not for long. This place was so beautiful natural and whimsical all the same time highly recommend it
Blue Hole Jamaica,Just got back from our Jamaica trip.  Spent a morning at the Blue Hole - EXCELLENT.  Make sure you go into the MAIN entrance (middle) because the other two smaller locations have limited access to the different spots.  We rented a taxi to take us from Riu Ocho Rios for $100 and paid $20 each to get in.  Our guide was GREAT and we tipped him $30.  The overall experience took us a little over one hour.  There was practically no one else there and we had the place to ourselves.  This allowed us to take some incredible pictures without people in the background and we were able to jump and swing multiple times into the pools.  Try to book your excursion when there is NO cruise ship docked for the day - this helps to reduce the number of people there.  This is a must see and is breath taking.  You will enjoy this for sure.
Beautiful,This place was beautiful. Similar to Dunns River Falls. Lots of hiking/climbing. Pools were not as blue as they appeared in pictures. Negative is they take you on these trails through a bunch of vendors trying to sell you stuff and lots of people smoking and selling weed...kind of took away some of the natural beauty we wanted to experience. You feel a bit on edge/nervous as the guides start whistling ahead to let the vendors know you are coming up the trail. Not sure what you may be walking into.
"Picturesque mineral springs with a deep swimming cave, a pool & a grill, plus mud massages","This is must-do in Ocho Rios. Please be advised that the admission ticket can only be bought with cash ($15 USD each). Also, the lifeguards/tour guides that take you through the Blue Hole will expect their renumeration separately. This is a beautiful location with multiple waterfalls and jumping points. If you do not know how to swim, they will provide you with life vests. There will be people hawking water shoes, plastic bags for keeping your phone etc. Best to come prepared. Also, you can rent a locker box for $2 USD."
Wonderful,This was a great experience with a wonderful guide named Kenny. The Blue hole is a beautiful and fun to check out. They also have a place to change clothes.
Island Gully Blue Hole Tour,"Great time. Beautiful falls. Be sure to wear water shoes. Bring a dry bag if you want to take pictures. Make sure you get driven there by a tour company!  It is way out of the way and the roads are bad!  Overall, fun time."
Javier the best guide and worth the drive from Falmouth port ,We visited Blue Hole today after pulling into the Falmouth cruise port on Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas.  It’s about an hour and a half drive from the cruise port and we had a private driver waiting for us to take us to Blue Hole.  It is so worth the drive.   The entrance fee is only $15 and it’s an experience of a lifetime.  Not near as crowded as Dunns River Falls and the guide we had could not have been any better.  Javier was super helpful for me because I needed a little extra handholding and he was so patient and kind. He even made sure that the rest of the family got to do all the bigger jumps while I did a littler jumps.   Absolutely the best job Blue Hole for hiring Javier. Javier Took our cell phone and carried it through the falls making sure to take pictures and videos of us along the way. They don’t charge for this but I was sure to tip him as just one picture or two on the cruiseship would’ve cost me $60. I have over 50 pictures of my family from him on my personal cell phone!  What service. Blue Hole is different from Dunn’s River Falls as there’s these pools of water between the falls where you can swim.  And they are a brilliant blue color.
Great even on a rainy day,"Rather than book a tour here for our family of 7 adults and 3 kids (3,6,12), we grabbed a taxi for I believe $150 for the whole day. He drove us to the Blue hole and then to lunch after and also dropped us off for shopping at the straw market (highly suggest not going here - high pressure!!!!!) and back to the cruise ship.  The blue hole was beautiful even though we were there in a rain storm so the water was muckier than usual from the run off.  You DO NOT need water shoes like they say!!!   The trail is easy.  Teenage locals grab you right away and take you on the tour. We felt like that was mandatory, but I am not so sure you can't just go without a guide. We let the local lead us and let his photographer take pictures here and there, which they will try to sell you afterwards on a CD for an outrageous price! (My hubby got him down to less than half then the original price)  Also, they had told us we shouldn't take our own camera's because we would be swimming. NOPE!  Such a lie.  Take your own cameras!  We jumped off a high cement cliff, swam behind a waterfall into a cave and caught a rope swing into another pool. The water is swift by the waterfall, so wear a life jacket if not a strong swimmer or little like my grand-daughter who was 2. The whole family enjoyed this. Wish we hadn't felt rushed by a tour.  We were lucky to have gotten there earlier than buses from tours, so I can see why they guide you and keep you moving in and out of the jungle. Crowd control."
Beautiful Falls Accumulating Litter with Aggressive “Lifeguards”,"The blue hole is way up the hill in a more remote area than Dunn’s River Falls and as you approach you start to see scores of young men wearing blue shirts that say “Lifeguard.” Even while our car was moving they’re approaching the car and yelling at the driver. It is obvious that there is a lot of competition to guide a guest and no structured way to have them assigned. It is pretty much a free for all and it becomes quite chaotic and uncomfortable. The fee to get in is $20 per person and does not include the guide. It seemed that one is required, but there really isn’t a need for one. There is a short trail to several holds with the last one having a platform to jump into the water. The entry is populated with vendors selling souvenirs, beer, shots, and pot. The water and surrounding area is littered with trash. What is a beautiful place is being ruined by bottles and bags floating in the holes, and food plates and plastic forks lying on the ground. Thirty-years ago Dunn’s River Falls was like this, but it’s much cleaner and organized now. Hopefully they can turn this around and save this site. When the “guided” portion was over (less than an hour) we tipped the guide $10 (25%, and almost 1/2 day’s pay for most Jamaicans) and he said that $40-50 was a good tip and this wasn’t enough. Another couple (who tipped a similar amount with another guide) had the same experience. Worth a trip but go with your eyes open and be careful. Dunn’s River is safer, cleaner, more organized, and actually cheaper when you factor in the guide’s fee. (At Dunn’s River the guides are clearly optional.)"
AMAZING,"The falls and view were unbelievable! Natural spring water coming from the mountains of Jamaica. Jumping into the ""Blue Hole"" was really cool. Jumping off the higher cliffs was even cooler!"
Great Waterfall trip ,Better than Dunn’s River Falls!!! If you want to jump off of things and into water then this one is for you!! Take water shoes as they are required!!!
Simply the best experience,"Javier and Atika were great in our tour at the Blue Hole, we had so much fun! The waterfalls were great! Take your water shoes!"
Awesome Place!,"This place was awesome! We used a separate transportation company to drive us from our resort and they had everything set up with a guide when we got there. My wife and I pretty much had the whole place to ourselves, which made for amazing pictures! The cliff diving and rope swing were such a great time! I would highly recommend this to anyone!!"
Beautiful place to visit,"We were recommended this by our friend in our hotel as it is nearby. I rented a car while in Jamaica so was able to drive my wife there. As we approached a crazy Jamaican flagged us down asking if we were going to the falls, we said yes and he suddenly appeared in our back seat and became our guide for our time there. He was crazy and well known by everyone as waterbird. We really liked him but expect to be asked for a tip for his services. These guys are locals and dont get paid so live off tips or so Ive been told. He did say to me halfway thru our trip. ""I just wanted to say man, I usually get around 50 dollas upward per couple."" I laughed. He said we can negotiate. Monet was not mentioned again and he got back to  keeping us entertained.He was very good, stayed with us all the time during our time there telling us about the local area, vegitation, best/safe jump spots and we had a good laugh. He took massive runs and launched himself off the top jump (30ft I think) into the water which why they call him waterbird as he certainly does fly. He pointed out some spots where rastas hang out, smoke and chill in the blue water. Plenty of weed available in the area if you want it.He had a professional camera which he took loads of photos of us and they put on a cd for you for a 60dollar charge. I laughed.We gave waterbird a 25 dollar tip and paid 25 for the cd. I might have been able to negotiate cheaper but I did not try. I just paid them half of what they wanted and they were happy/we were happy. Entry is 15 dollars(not negotiable) per person and includes a life jacket if you want one.Overall this was an amazing highlight to our visit to Jamaica. Various jumps into cool blue water for people of all bravery thresholds. Have fun!!"
Christmas vacay with my hubs,"Romaine, Romaine, Romaine!!! The best guide ever. Beautiful scenery. Breathtaking jumps. Wear water shoes"
Surreal ,Amazing time.... the only part u didnt enjoy was the drive to the blue hole... there are cliffs on tour left side.  . It's quite scary. The actual excursion was unreal... felt like a dream.... tour in the middle if a mountain I don't know how many feet up in the air but there is natural water everywhere... its beautiful... I wouldn't recommend it for children under 6 or 7.
Blue home Parado de in Jamaica,"Breathtaking, locales were so lovely, hospitable & kind. Bit of a trek but worry it. Absolutely perfect , recommended & to be repeated."
Perfect!  Bring your water shoes,"We booked via Royal Caribbean and traveled with Chukka Caribbean Adventurers.  Our guide Dwight and driver Desmond were excellent.  It was a long ride (over 2 hours) but worth it. Ride goes fairly quickly as the guide points out areas of interest and provides some history. The site is beautiful and clean.  Everyone at the site was friendly, fun and helpful.  You need water shoes.  You will have an opportunity to buy them on the way but I recommend doing so ahead to insure a good fit and price.  Plan to have your waterproof cameras and some cash. I also recommend going to the bathroom before riding out. They make one pit stop on the ride out, but you likely won't want to use it."
Loved it!,"A must visit and pocket your dives into the list of your experiences. This was in the middle of a rainforest with little pockets of baby blue water. the long upward and windy travel was the only downside of this visit because my daughter threw up. but had she not eaten just before the bus ride, it would have been ok. But then to get to the beautiful rainforest, the trip is worth it. The guide was amazing and friendly. He took us through the waterfalls and started with smaller cliffs. The first one even my 6 yr old could do. Slowly, we went to the 28 ft deep cliff and although it seemed crazy scary, it was the most amazing. Then we did the one with the rope where he swings us into the water and you let go off the rope once you are in the center of the water body."
Beautiful ,"Well worth a visit, great to see and a nice change from the beach. Cool clear water, great fun to jump into."
Beautiful water,"Cold water at the edge but once in its warm, very deep water so you are expected to wear a life preserver, you can jump in or dive in its 12ft plus at one end 5ft the other."
"Perfect place to see wild nature in Jamaica, jump from 15 ft rock and swim in cold water","I made a trip to this place only 1 week ago, and decided to write a short review - because it is really worth of visiting. There are little tourists - few times less then Dunns falls or YS Falls, and trip to this place goes through real jungles. This is a good place to feel wild Jamaica, where are little tourists, crystal clear water and perfect place to jump from 15 ft high. also, it is really not far from Ocho Rios, so plan to visit it, if you stopped in this city or will come to Ocho for a few days."
Nice hike!,"Hike through the river to the pools and waterfalls, jump off each of the 3 jumping spots, cold water but definitely worth a try...very enjoyable...another thing to tick off your bucket list!"
Must Do in Ocho Rios!,"Great experience. WOuld go again. So beautiful and refreshing. Great for friends and family if there are no little children. I'd recommend getting the life vest just to be able to float in the water. Also, water shoes are recommended!"
"There are 3 Entrances to the River Waterfalls, Only One Gets You Here","There are several places called the ""blue hole"" on the island of Jamaica. The one in Ocho Rios is the best and original.  It is located on the White River and there are a series of spectacular waterfalls and swimming holes connected by a trail alongside the river. There are three entrances to the river falls, each of which solicit payment for entry. They all sell themselves as the Blue Hole but only one gets you access to the place on the river that with this attraction (otherwise you have to pay extra). It is the second left after the power plant; follow the tour buses. Once there, the guides in blue will take you up the trails to other falls and swimming holes. Estimate about 3-4 hours for the best experience. Trails are not wheelchair accessible and require moderate fitness levels. Ask for Keniel and please tell him Owen sent you - he swam at the Blue Hole when it was still a secret among locals and will take great care of you."
Beautiful Water Fall in Paradise,"This is an absolute gem in the middle of paradise.  The Water Falls are so beautiful and my family had a great time.  The Staff were so kind, encouraging and helpful.There are four different water fall jumps that were an absolute blast to do.I would recommend this place and I hope to visit Blue Hole / Island Gully Falls again."
Blue Hole,Blue hole was a cool place.  You can sit by the pool and listen to music or hike in nearbye mountains to marijuana grove or jump into the blue hole.  There is an affordable hotel on site.  There are ducks being raised in nearbye pond and I was told you could order jerk duck.  Inside the cave is a clay deposit that can be used to do skin treatment.
Beauty and adventure,"We loved the Blue Hole. Our guide was fantastic!  He took his time with us and went through all the stops so we could see and do everything we wanted to. He also made sure our things (phone, shoes, glasses) were taken care of so we could do anything we wanted to without a worry. And he took a bunch of pictures along the way which were really great!  The site is just gorgeous scenery and it’s fun to walk through and do all the jumps into the water. You do need a guide so you know where it is safe to go so don’t resist. You won’t regret having one!"
It is a beautiful place but...,"I felt rushed and pushed around... “let’s go, let’s go...” not my type of activity. I loved the place and our guide was nice otherwise. I am not into high traffic touristic stuff, hence the score."
WOW!  A MUST DO when in Jamaica!,This is definitely worth every penny and every minute of the trip!  The guides at Blue Hole are very friendly and helpful!  I asked for a life vest since I am not a good swimmer- and jumping off the cliff was so worth it!  It really is a lifetime experience.  It should definitely be in everybody's bucket list.
Great Experience,"Hurry up and visit before this too becomes just a commercial excursion.  Nature lovers will love it.  Note, a degree of physical fitness and some ability to swim required (life vests are provided)."
1 Hour is not enough!,"This place is just great! The rise to the falls is guided and you get the chance to dive from several spots. Unfortunately, unlike the Dunn's River, you can't enjoy the tour yourself or stay on the path as much as you want. Space for improvement!"
Meet real nature of Jamaica,A must see in Jamaica! Via paths like in a movies of indianna jones we walked to the blue hole. Just one word 'wonderful'
Fun day trip with private taxi,Really good natural environment and not madmade unlike some of other of the waterfall s in the area. Guide's really helpful just agree a tip before and stick to it can be a little pushy also will be alitte pushy also with photos take your own camera or phone .☺️
Beautiful scenery,"Beautiful scenery, water was greatYou have to be smart. Many people trying to separate you from your money. Quite persistent but not relentless, just got annoying."
Mad fun,"It was a blast, they're very helpful and I don't have any complaints. I enjoy it every time I visit."
November 2019,I dont reccomend this unless you are fit. There is alot of climbing. Waterfalls are beautiful but must go up hill an steps on rough terrain.
Great place,This is a wonderful place reasonable price to go in and our tour guide Sheldon was great with us giving us every little detail. The walk is long to the top of the fall but the mud scrub we got after was great definately going back.
Kind of like Dunns River back in the day.,"We had a great day, we had heard about the Blue Hole and wanted to go on an adventure..... AND we did, its a little out of the way and through a little back country but worth the drive and the time.  We ported out of Falmouth and it took about an hour or so to get there.  Its a pretty aggressive walk through the jungle, and the trails are pretty steep at points. Also they are all about selling you goods along the way, they are pushy but reasonably respectful if told no.  Its Jamaica and just about anywhere you go its about the $$$.  We enjoyed the trip and would recommend it, go earlier if you can it was getting very busy when we left. We got there about 9 or 9:30 and spent an hour and a half or so.  It was also rainy but in the jungle it didn't matter. We still had a blast!"
Leptospirosis warning!!! Deadly bacteria,"WARNINGA beautiful experience with great photo opportunities but very risky. We returned from Jamaica on 22 Oct and had booked an excursion to Dunn’s River Falls and the Luminous Lagoon via Expedia. It had been raining the day before so the company emailed to ask if we would mind changing the Luminous Lagoon to The Blue Hope/Secret Waterfall. We had heard good things so agreed. Since returning my husband became seriously ill and was diagnosed with leptospirosis. It’s a rare disease that can be picked up in freshwater. Due to the incubation period and symptoms, the infectious diseases specialists believe that it was picked up during this excursion. My husband and I did the same things bar one; I did not use the zip wires at The Blue Hole - my husband did and we think he swallowed some infected water when he landed, whereas I just walked in and swam. He started with flu-like symptoms then around 5 days after they began was jaundiced (skin and eyes), his kidneys and liver failed, had D&V, was confused and could barely move.  He’s only 38 and has been told it’s one of the worst cases of jaundice they’ve seen and had he been less fit and/or older he would likely have died. He was admitted to intensive care on 4 Nov for 10 days and is still in an isolation ward hospital, weak and still has poor kidney and liver function (albeit it much better than it was). It’s not highly documented so wanted to raise awareness. Do not enter freshwater if you have broken skin either as this also puts you at risk."
Amazing experience ,"I’d researched about going to blue hole before going and it didn’t disappoint! I would definitely recommend coming to this trip though with a organised trip whether it be private tour which we did with Best Jamaica or one from your hotel, our driver Leroy took care of the initial meet etc and found us a tour guide it just made it very smooth run. Without a doubt you NEED water shoes There’s a walk into the blue hall is a little muddy underfoot but nothing to be worried about, you have locals all along the way selling local goods!!Once Into the blue hole our tour guide was brilliant he had our phone for the whole time so he captured so many amazing photos, you have the options to be as active as you wish, jumping off rocks or you can find low level entrances to enter the water!I won’t give much more away as you must visit it’s just amazing and for only  $15 pp"
Fun - but....,..... also here the guides wanted tip money.... My guide said he wanted 20$ US after the blue hole tour ! That sux! Jamaica is a no tipping country !
Fast and expensive,15 to get in 60 to get there less than a hour scenery was beautiful like every were up sell is the game high pressure sales tactics I’d go again
Cold water in Jamaica,"We took an excursion offered by RCCL and weren’t disappointed. It really is beautiful and worth the trip but be prepared for a drive. Like most excursions it would have been nice to have had more time(which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but it is what it is. It involves walking and climbing on rocks so be aware. The water is plenty deep as some of the jumps are over or near 30’ so you have no ability to wear life jackets so swimming is a must and yes, the water is cold believe it or not. The guides stress safety and get a little aggravated when people do stupid things(like diving) and there are several life guards available if needed. So if you don’t mind heights and are in decent shape and cold water isn’t a problem then this trips definitely for you."
"Beautiful setting, great staff, vigorous hike and swim","We were brought there by a local guide, which was good because the roadway route to the venue is not well marked and goes through a residential neighborhood.  It's a standard-equipped venue for a small Jamaican town, with changing rooms, restrooms and a snack shop at the parking area.  Our local guide arranged to have a staff guide from the facility (Andre, highly recommended) accompany us, which was a good idea because the route to the top has a few unmarked turns and the trail crosses the small river a couple of times.  The falls are beautiful with nice deep pools at the bottom, the rocks are surprisingly not slippery at all, and the water is chilly and clear.  The hike to the top is maybe 2 miles in through a lovely tropical forest, moderate steepness, some scrambling over rocks.  Swimmable rock shoes are recommended. There were several small vendors along the trail offering snacks or souvenirs.  Definitely not wheelchair accessible."
I faced my fears,Andre was out tour guide for the day along with our taxi guy poppy who never left our side the entire journey +1 (876) 849-4357 feel free to contact him he was very affordable 😊 Andre the tour guide helped me face my fear i climbed i swam i had a bawl i was so scared at first but he assured me that he wouldn't allow anything to happen to me n i am happy i trusted him the view was amazing the water cold but felt so good i even made my way up to have a clay bath it had my skin feeling like silk after 😂 make sure u purchase some water shoes i helps for the sharp rocks n sliding enjoy ur tour when u good i sure did
A Must Do!,"We had a taxi take us instead of a tour, which is what I would suggest. That way, you can go at your own pace. Our guide, Coco, went above and beyond his job. He helped me physically up and sown stairs that were a little steep. The waterfall knocked my glasses off. I thought they were goners. Coco put on goggles and searched for them. He found them!!! He was very kind and very helpful. The place is beautiful. The water was a bit too cold at first, but after slashing around to get from one end to the other, you get used to it and it is no longer to cold. We thoroughly enjoyed it."
Blue Hole didnt disappoint!,"We booked with Peat Taylor's excursions before cruising to Jamaica. They met us at the cruise pier and drove us to the Blue Hole. The Blue Hole is a progression of cliffs. You go with a guide and hike to the first cliff. It's about 10 feet. You keep moving down from cliff to cliff until you reach the last one. Its about 25 feet. The water is clear and cold. It is fresh water (not salt). We had a blast! The tour company added to the experience by staying and waiting for us.  No locker neccessary with them. Otherwise, you dont take anything that cant get wet!"
Blue Hole-Best excursion ever!!,"I was there with my wife and 4 daughters, (12,9,6,4).  We had Dario as our personal lifeguard and Josh as our photographer.  The day was wonderful, and the waterfalls were so beautiful.  The jumps were fantastic and my family had the best day and the most memorable of our cruise vacation!!  Dario was making sure that everyone was having a great time and safety was always number 1 with him.  Having small children, I really appreciated that part!! Dario had gotten our 3 younger girls life jackets and made sure they were properly sized for them as well.  Dario was encouraging and supportive with every jump.  We couldn't have asked for a better guide while at the Blue Hole."
Fantastic Venue,The kids always want to go the the Blue Hole.  They love jumping off ledges into the water.  This is a natural wonder with beautiful water and scenery.  The guide we had was very attentive and made sure we stayed safe yet had an enjoyable time.
"Blue Hole , Ocho Rio's","If you are around Ochio Rio's , you have to take in , the spectacular beauty of the Blue Hole. Unlike Dunn's River Falls, the Blue Hole is run by the local villagers,Unlike the tourist traps of Dunn's River, The blue hole offers more than just a few waterfall's  to walk up, you get the chance to dive in to the cool waters,There are rope swings to enjoy, also climb down into the rocks and swimming out under a waterfall,, i have been to Dunns River Falls twice and find the experience some what intimidating,being told by your guide not to forget i will be waiting for my tip,,fat chance ,,, but the Blue Holes is on a different level ,the locals are there to help you enjoy your visits and they do"
Beautiful ,The ride there was scary I just can’t deal with those narrow roads in Jamaica. But it was worth the trip. This place is simply breathtaking if I could I would just sit there and look at the water all day.
Great spot not well traveled by tourists,Much fun had here.  Wished we had spent more time here than the very tourist busy Dunns River Falls.  Here you could take your time and jump in the water as often as you like.  The water is beautiful.
Amazing!,"Blue hole was amazing! Between the sites and jumping into natural pools of water, we had a great time. Water shoes are a must!!! Expect to be soaked from the walking up the waterfalls and jumping into the water. We had Alex who was great making sure we had fun and was safe. Sandals never told us to bring money so we honestly didn’t think about it until the end when he mentioned it. We felt horrible since we couldn’t  but he made us feel even worse when he told my husband to come over to him and then said he should show appreciation to him by tipping him. VERY rude"
Unreal fun !!!,So happy I went to these beautiful falls !!! Our guide was awesome and it was so much fun ! Totally would recommend doing the falls
WOW,A great experience. Guide was excellant. water was so clean and very very cold but we made it all the way. So peaceful in spots yet so exciting in others
A little piece of Paradise,What can I say this place was absolutely amazing. The water was warm and beautiful it's nature at it's best. The tour guide was hilarious and worth every penny.
Great Experience,"Excursion off resort. We visited the blue hole after a recommendation from the driver who picked us up at the airport. They said Dunn’s River was a great option as well, but that the blue hole is a more local spot. Our guide was Marvin and he was very kind and helped keep us safe. He also took our cell phone and acted as our “paparazzi” by snapping some great pics."
The Jewel of Ocho Rios,Spectacular views. Beautiful water. Tranquil and exciting all wrapped up into one gorgeous natural treasure. Get brave and do the rope swing off the cliff into the clear blue water and be sure to accept the offer of a lifejacket if you're anything less than an Olympic swimmer because cute current is strong! Take the walk up to the small waterfall afterwards and enjoy the relaxation of a mud rub before washing it off in the falls.
Refreshing Water,"The Blue Hole was an incredible experience. You go on a very light hike through these mini waterfalls, then jump down the pockets in the falls. It is so much fun and the water is refreshing. Go if you are in Ocho Rios!"
River Rush,"Great place for the adventurous. Lovely hike to the top of the river. Make sure you are fit. Water is just divine. Jumping, diving,just simply relaxing.  I'm planning on going again."
Blue Hole,Our visit to Blue Hole was amazing.  Such a beautiful place with so many waterfalls and places to jump. Our tour guide Jason was awesome!!!!   Be sure to have water shoes with a good grip on bottom.
Fantastic adventure for all! ,"Thank you to our spectacular guide, Glen!We were a group ages 2 to 71 and you found a way to make every person in our group feel adventurous, accomplished, and happy.The jumps are exhilarating. 🍀The water is so clear and clean. 💙What a great day! 🇯🇲🌴😎"
Incredible! Not to be missed! ,My husband and my 3 children came here as part of a cruise excursion. My youngest is six and I definitely would not take any child younger than that.  It was incredible. Not only was it extremely beautiful but the people who worked here were so great with my kids. The jumps were so fun and the last one was so high! Make sure you have good water shoes.
Wowzers,Ok it’s higher than it looks in the pictures!  Great guides who a patient and fearless!  I did two jumps and my husband did them all. The swing was fun too!  I would defiantly go again and maybe not be so chicken.  Thanks Julian for your patience!
Beautiful and refreshing.,The blue hole was beautiful and the water refreshing. It does require a moderate activity level climbing up and down to get to the falls and water holes. Would recommend water shoes as some rocks can be quite slippery.  There is a rope swing you can use and life jackets for those less comfortable. Our guide David was amazing. He took many wonderful photos on my phone and made sure we stayed together as a group and felt safe.
Great look at Natural surroundings,Blue Hole apparently has three different area's I was at Island Gully Falls which is apparently the only one licensed by the tourist department in Jamaica as of this writing. That being said apparently they do need to follow stricter guidelines. The area is beautiful. You will climb up the waterfall for a little bit then will jump into various area's.
Great day with Troy an excellent guide,"This was a great day for our family, the guide Troy made it a excellent adventure and ensured our small personalised tour was always safe, but even assisted with picture taking on our own phones etc, which made it even better as you had the memories there and then.Highly recommend asking for Troy if you do the Blue hole trip👍👍👍🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲"
Excellent,"""Island Gully Falls"" is undoubtedly one of Jamaica's hidden treasures, awesome jungle experience, perfect blue water, some thrills plus breathtaking views. Our private guide is “Captain Robert (Bob?)”, he is amazing, took great care of us, very polite and tentative. I will highly recommend this place and this person."
Great Adventure in Ocho Rios,The place itself is wonderful with very clear blue water and waterfalls. It is worth to visit this place if you like cliff jumping.
Fun!,Life guards are people person and Fun! Everyone seems helpful and it's just a great experience overall ! I prefer here than Dunne river falls
Anniversary ,It was an Awesome and beautiful place to see! Lots to do and see. Would recommend this as a must see! We would definitely go and do it again.
Bluehole,It was awesome. Definitely a place to visit when you get a chance. Which it was a little easier to find though.
Blue Hole is a Jamaican must!,"This was a blast!  This little gem is tucked away into the native scenery, very picturesque, and refreshing.  Some of the women in our group were afraid to go up to the falls and crawl through the hole, but you have to do this....it's the main experience!  So much fun, with such a feeling of adventure.  The experience is with the Jamaicans and their little jewel!   Experience it all.  The water is so clear & blue and COLD!  But the thrill of it makes it very tolerable!   Would do it again & recommend to anyone I know going to Jamaica.  A must!"
excursion in Jamaica,"This was something we never knew about.  This was our 4th trip to Jamaica and wanted something new and exciting to do.  Scenery was beautiful, water refreshing and there are photo opportunities."
Blue Hole and Secret Falls Family Adventure,"We traveled to Blue Hole and Secret Falls with 4 adults and 5 kids ages 11, 9, 6, 6 and 1. We spent 2 hours at Blue Hole and Secret Falls jumping into the pools and swimming around. We hiked a short ways up the canyon to the upper waterfalls to take photos and start swimming. There are 4 jumps into the pools at heights of 2 meters, 1 meter, 5 meters and 8 meters. We did the largest jump several times as the kids thought this was the best experience. There was also a rope swing into the largest pool that the kids loved. Some in our party were unwilling or unable to jump and swim, but this wasn't an issue at all. They photographed the experience for us and did an OK job with the photography, so be sure to take some of your own. A waterproof container for your camera is absolutely necessary however. Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend this to anyone."
You have to go to the blue hole!!!!!,"Your Jamaican experience will not be complete unless you visit the Blue Hole. Beautiful water with lush forest scenery. Rope swings, and rock jumping make it a thrill seekers dream! Our tour guides were awesome! Mario and Chavon were incredible. They took us on every rock, every waterfall, they were encouraging but not pushy. SO much fun!!!!! Bring swim shoes and a towel. Also, let them take your photos then buy the CD we paid $50 and got 160 pictures! Definitely worth it!!!"
Fabulous excursion,"My 26 year old daughter and I went and we had a wonderful time. Donovan was our driver (booked through our resort). Very informative about sites along the way. Once at the falls, Troy was our main guide. He was funny, helpful, and knowledgeable. I have some physical limitations and he was very helpful and attentive to me. If you go, be sure to ask for him."
Great family trip,We went to the Blue Hole with 2 children aged 5 and 8. The water was very fresh & it did take the kids longer to acclimatise to the water. It would have been good if we could have spent some time in the water to get used to the water before jumping.My 8 yr old started off with small jumps but ended up doing the Tarzan swing & the final big jump by herself. My 5yr old was happy to do the small jump options but when on my husbands back to do the Tarzan swing. At the end he did ask to do back and do it all again!!At the Blue Hole our guide was Kourtney. He was very good with the kids. He held their hands when walking in the faster flowing water and along the waterfalls. We felt confident in him. He encouraged by husband to do some jumps (he has a fear of heights) but never forced anyone to do anything they didn’t want to. When my 8yr old daughter decided to do the final jump he explained to her the best way to land & encouraged her. He also took videos of us.At the end we saw the 98 photos that were taken of us. They wanted $60 for the DVD of the photos but accepted $30. I booked the whole excursion via Tripadvisor with a company called Jaital. It was the best deal I found & a lot cheaper than the package our hotel were offering us. I booked at 5pm for a 1pm pick up the following day & received a confirmation email 3hrs later. Our driver was Silvan. He arrived on time & never rushed us at any point. We were the only ones (5 of us aged 5-61) being picked up. He helped us sort out the waivers & made sure we got life jackets for the kids. He gave us some local information on our journey up to the Blue Hole. We were able to leave all our dry stuff in the car as he was waiting to take us back. He put paper in the floor of the car so when we finished we didn’t need to get changed we just sat on our towels in the car. It was a fantastic experience. We are thinking of returning before our holiday is over...if we can fit it in!
Blue hole and tubing ,"We had a wonderful time on this shore excursion with Liberty if the Seas cruise ship. Climbing up waterfalls, jumping off cliffs up to 20 feet, rope swing. We are in our seventies and with families and couples and all found it exciting and fun. Then went tubbing down a river to lunch of delicious jerk chicken and rum punch. Great day. Highly recommend it. Our guides at Blue hole and guides Allen, Chantelle, and driver Jeff were wonderful."
Jamaica's hidden gem,"WOW! A breath taking experience! Beautiful, thrill seeking, guides are awesome. I would definitely go again on our next visit."
Loved it!,"Very cool, beautiful and refreshing!! Awesome experience!!  If you're adventurous I recomend it over Dunns River Falls!!"
Had such a fun day!,Visited for the first time with a friend of mines. It was just to two of us and we had a total blast! It had been raining earlier which may have contributed to it not being very crowded but we weren’t complaining. We purchased shoes before we entered and had a guide with us who was very helpful with taking pics and guiding us through. Loved the fact that we could leave our stuff in lockers too and from start to finish the entire experience was well organised. We gave our guide a tip which may not have been satisfactory as he commented that he’d usually get $3000JA. I didn’t let this comment bother me as the whole experience was amazing and figured as it was a slow day he was trying to get a bigger one. In the end we gave him an extra $200JA which totalled $2200. I would definitely go back as it was such a lovely day. My friend and I had an amazing time!
Waterfall ,"This was truly the highlight for my wife and I. Our guide Odean was positively the BEST! Just a joy to be around, and .so insightful, and helpful throughout the intire course of the excursion. We had the time of our lives taking great pictures  ( Odean was also a great photographer), getting in the refreshing fresh rain water, it had rained very heavy the night before, and seeing all the herbs, and natural beauty of the mountain country. Top of my list! A1 the absolute best! Make sure that Odean is your guide!"
Great Time,"What can I say that hasn't already been said! Believe everything you've read about this amazing spot because its all true! Not commercialized and kept in its natural state, the White River is the water source for most of the island. $15 USD entry fee plus tip for your guide. Camera, water shoes and courage to jump are all you need for this one! You do need to be able to climb, the terrain is rugged. There are several vendors, we went on a tour and was told that the one at the very top of the mountain is safe and insured. Life jackets are available for those that are unsure. The water moves quickly and is cold, takes your breath away so make sure that whatever you bring with you is secure. 5 jumping spots including a rope jump. Good for teens as well, wouldn't recommend for younger families."
Amazing views and experience,"We wanted to see the mountains and waterfalls the area is known for. We did not plan to go rock jumping but when we got there we couldn’t resist. Our driver, Laurel from Goldeneye, made arrangements with Dillon to show us the ropes (yes, I think I’m clever) and take us up the mountain. We forgot our water shoes and were able to buy some and there were shops set up along the trail going up the mountain with drinks and souvenirs. The scenery was gorgeous and the water was beautiful (even though the locals told us it was murky that day because of the rain the day before). This was such an amazing experience and nothing I would have the guts to do at home or under different circumstances. The photos do not give justice to this beautiful area. It was peaceful and not over crowded with tourists. We were rock jumping with locals, it was amazing!  We did purchase the photo package and had paparazzi following us through the mountain and Dillon took videos on our phone. Dillon went above and beyond and we had an awesome experience."
Blue Hole is a must when in Jamaica!,"We were so grateful that our guide took us up to Blue Hole for the day! We wish we would have had more money with us to tip our lifeguard/ Blue Hole guide! His name was Andre, and he was amazing! He took the most spectacular pictures of us at each of the special areas that make up the Blue Hole experience. Blue Hole and the pictures/ videos we came home with were priceless! If we go again, we will definitely ask for Andre by name! And we had our own personal tour guide for the day named Ray Ray who was fantastic as well!! What a great way to end our Jamaica trip!"
Most beautiful place visited,"The blue hole is breathtaking. Not crowded with tourist. Fun ride up the mountain. Our guide-Big T made the trip unforgetable for our teenage boys. Fun, fun, fun! Big T was very patient and considerate of our elderly mom with us. The zip line guys were all fun. The guide on river tube (not Thomas, but the good bald guy who kept scaring me) was funny and entertaining. Thanks for the good times!"
A must see & do!!,"An amazing, magical place hidden in the mountains! This visit is a must do if you love adventure or thrill seeking or even if you just want to experience the beauty of blue hole. Arriving was mental, not knowing what to expect, however Tejay was called to come and be our guide. For 15$ you are given a tour guide who takes you up and through the rainforest showing you the hidden treasures. Our boys (11 & 14) gained confidence & trust in Tejay as he jumped in and out the pools with so much experience but also making us feel safe and taking amazing care of us! Would go back tomorrow!!"
Blue Hole Zip Line and Tube,"Our guides Allen the Irishman, Marley and Jay were fun energetic, and all around great. They made our experience fun the entire time. The Jerk chicken lunch was delicious. The waterfalls were amazing. Loved this tour."
Amazing!!!,"First I need to give a shout out to Courtney he is amazing!!! Blue hole is gorgeous! My boyfriend has a blast jumping off anything and everything I can’t jump but I still enjoyed my time there. Nice on the eyes, you get to connect with the paradise around you! My bf lost his iPhone on a dive and Courtney got it back for him with no problems! Can’t thank him enough! Beautiful, more fun than Dunn’s River and worth every penny spent."
Great Day,"We went here today and had a great time, the staff were super friendly and nice to be around, the tour guide helped us get through everywhere we needed help with !"
Awesome place to visit ,If you want some adventure for a minimal cost you have to check out this place. It’s beautiful and so fun!!
Excellent !,The experience was wonderful! I traveled with a group and we were  so scared to jump off but our tour guide Malik was so patient and accommodating.He made the experience better and we would definitely recommend.
Loved it!,"This is a great visit and a must do in Jamaica. Absolutely beautiful place and the water is refreshing, cold but you get used to it quickly. I loved the jumps from all over into the water, it was a blast.  Our guide was Marvin and he was a good guy and recommended by our driver, Randy Reid from Best Jamaica tours. They were great and he was a great driver who went with us and took pictures for us all day."
Awesome place,"Very cool place to visit and not expensive. Guides are great but bring your own water camera because pics they take are expensive. Bring water shoes. DO THE BIG JUMP at the end. Your brain will say no, but you will be glad once you take the leap."
Blue hole waterfall ,Bit of a drive to get there but really great water fall and staff were great did not look for tips but everyone tipped let the photos tell the rest
Amazing Experience,"We were a party of 4, 2 adults, 2 children aged 10 & 9 visiting Jamaica on a cruise ship.  One of our excursions was the Blue Hole and it was amazing.  We had a great time, my 9 year old dare devil put us all to shame lol!  The guide that took as round was a lovely boy, the water was beautiful and the jumps certainly got the adrenalin pumping.  Jamaica ended up being our favourite place on our cruise itinerary.  I would definitely recommend the Blue Hole to anyone looking for a little adventure when in Jamaica, yeh man!"
Highly Recommend!,"9/29/19Our guides, prearranged by our driver, were Clinton and Nick.  They made this the best excursion I’ve taken to date.  Took me out of every comfort zone I thought I had.  I am a city girl and I don’t think I’ve done that much nature in my life. But I loved every second of it.  I had no idea what to expect, but the natural beauty was breathtaking. I don’t swim, but Nick did not let that stop me from having the full experience.  By the time we got to the part were we needed to cross the water, we had established a level of trust that allowed me to go for it.  He expertly brought me across the water.  Every step of the way, Clinton and Nick made sure we were safe and having fun. They told  you were to place your foot, how to step up, step down. Made adjustments according to  your physical needs.  Stopped when they thought you needed a break.  They carried our phones and took a lot of great pictures.  They were very knowledgeable of the area.  The falls were magnificent.  There are places of varying heights to do cliff jumping.  If you are fortunate to get Clinton and Nick, they will make sure you have an adventure you will never forget.  You will leave making plans on when you can come back."
Highly recommend,"Today my husband and I did the Blue Hole and tubing excursion with Chukka tours and it was fantastic.   I highly recommend doing this excursion, however equally as fantastic was our driver Uncle Roy.  I’m sorry if you are not  lucky enough to get him for a driver.  We have been on many trips out of our country and have never been so blessed with such a wonderful and knowledgeable driver. He made the drive to and from our resort so well worth the time it took to get there.  Today was absolutely a great way to spend our last day in Jamaica.  Good bye for now my friends!!!"
Once again breathtaking!,"This was our second trip to Blue Hole. We used the same guide as last time, Damaro, as we got well acquainted when we went with him a year ago. We plan on doing this yearly from now on. It’s so beautiful that you can hardly breathe. The earlier you go the less busy it will be. Avoid on cruise days to avoid the crowds. It can take 1-1.5 hours to travel up and back down.  It’s worth every second. The water is ice cold but that can be quite refreshing on hotter days."
Just a outting trip with the family,A great experience the water was great my kids and younger siblings had a great time I would go back and recommend anyone to have a family trip there.
Day trip,"This was an absolutely amazing experience , climbed up the fall to the top they start you by jumping of the little rocks into the water , my sister and I were nervous and done the baby jumps until the end and then both went and fone the 15ft one , I wimped out the 20ft was close but my fear did get the better of me , but it's so exciting and once in a lifetime experience definitely recommendThey two guys we had were great so attentive and helped with your fears and very good cameraman :)"
Bluest water I have ever seen!,"For my last adventure in Jamaica we (2 friends and I) went to the Cool Blue Hole in Ocho Rios. Here some facts... Entrance fee is a cost of 2000 JMD per person (for locals 500 JMD) and you can rent a locker for 800 JMD for the day. I suggest you bring water shoes with you because it can get slippery, but otherwise you can either rent or buy a pair there. It was amazing! Tyrone was our guide and he was so informative and offered to take a lot of pictures and videos. He showed us all the hidden spots and crawled with us through waterfall caves. We had so much fun! I would recommend this place to anyone that loves water and can swim (although they also have swim vests for rent, I just think it’s nicer when you are actually able to swim). Definitely worth visiting and great to spend some hours! Just keep in mind: This place is called COOL Blue Hole for a reason (the water is very refreshing). ;-)"
There is More Than One...,"but I wager you'll enjoy yourself either way. Carry tip money and get ready to jump, get wet, and have a good time."
Beautiful!,"If you love swimming and everything to do with water, you must visit this place. We came here and were also visiting Dunn’s River Falls after so we did not have near enough time to explore it all. We spent about an hour in this beautiful fresh water and had the time of our lives, jumping from platforms, swinging on rope swings and hiking through the trees. It is so beautiful and peaceful here. They offer life jackets if your not real comfortable in the water. They have a photographer following along taking pictures along the way for you. The entrance price is just $10. If you go, ask for Dave, he was absolutely awesome guiding us along and showing when and where to jump and being there for our safety if we needed help. My two teen boys 16 & 18 could have spent the whole day there. I definitely recommend this place for an awesome day in the refreshing water. If your not one for jumping there’s plenty of room to just have fun in the water. We will for sure be spending the day here on our next trip."
"Beautiful Blue Hole, Jamaica","A must in Ocho Rios Jamaica - We had Ryan as our tour guide, fantastic guy who amazed us with all the fantastic photos he managed to get of us. Knew exactly where to take the best shots of us."
Refreshing!!!!,"Nice and cool experience, The guys were Great, Kind, caring and very gentle. Very professional 5 STAR Review!!!"
Excellent but YOU MUST BE careful.,"Having visited the Blue Hole 6 years ago, it was still an quiet island spot for locals only with occassional tourists. Having just visited it again, what a total nightmare. The place is packed with tourists and busses unlike before, broken glass everywhere, people drinking out of glass bottles and its turned itself into a real hazard. They need regulations or just better rules to ensure safety. If you go, use caution. You do not want to get injured there. It is beautiful but its getting ruined and I didnt feel safe with all the hazards.."
Excellent experience,Booked a tour with Sham&Orion Authentic Jamaica Tours on Facebook who picked my group up for a private tour from the cruise ship dock. Had a great time. The guides were professional and helped my adventurous young ones have one of the funnest vacation experiences ever. Would recommend Sham & Orion's tours for a great outing while visiting on a cruise ship.
Amazing Adventure,"My wife and I had an amazing guided tour of Blue Hole! The water was so refreshing (although a little chilly for our 17 mo son) and the scenery was surreal. We climbed up through a cave, did a limestone cleanse and jumped into 40 ft deep water. The whole experience was amazing and we will definitely be returning!"
Exhilarating!,"This is one of the best experiences on our trip! The scenery was absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. Our guys helped us to climb a few rocky cliffs, to get to smaller jumping spots that build up to a high jumping spot. The fresh water was freezing at refreshing, and our group was so excited and adventurous to complete this adventure. I appreciate that they take you to smaller jumping points prior to taking you to the biggest jumping point to help build your confidence. They were encouraging to those who are a bit more hesitant, and gave freedom to those who wanted to be more adventurous."
Drove with a rental,"I was a bit hesitant with driving the rental because of the reviews but if your comfortable driving then you should be fine. The drive is paved just narrower but can fit two cars going through. Just be careful because some drivers drive fast down the hill. As for the guides, they will get you from the entrance near the brownie man, up to were you see all the guys in blue “lifegaurds”, we stayed at the bottom and parked and had Eriel guide us. Down on the bottom is where different guides offer to take you around. Eriel says that at the top of the hill is a private company Chukka or something or other where you have to book ahead of time. Parking on the bottom is fine, guide took us to get our entrance bracelet for 15 usd. They have little outdoor shops, mini lockers you can store some of your clothes, pay 200 jamaican dollars, restroom, beer, weed etc. and off you go, so fun. Tip: try going after 2 where there’s barely anyone there. The people from the cruise ships come in the morning and over crowds this beautiful place. Check my IG for a gopro quick video @lorinne_marie"
Blue Hole is a must see!,"We had a great time at Bluer Hole.  The staff were excellent in working with you to do each of the dives.  They start you at the lowest working up your confidence to do the taller jumps.  I am not one to do this and fully expected to not participate as we got to the taller jumps but because they were so good in their preparation, I had no trouble doing every jump/dive.  It was a blast!"
Pops - best tour guide ever!,"If Pops is not your tour guide don't bother doing this tour - he was that good! I am terribly afraid of heights but by the end of this tour I was jumping off cliffs into the blue hole like a pro! Pops was patient, calm and reassuring; I will forever be grateful to him for helping me conquer my fears! His positive energy and attitude made all the difference! Be sure to ask for Pops! 😁"
Best water attraction in Jamaica ,Brilliant day out for family and couples some good jumps and beautiful photographs. Such a good day out. Make sure you go to island gully falls as this is right at the top and you dont have to walk to the pools. Also the guides are brilliant there and really helpfull. Taken to this attraction by richard brooks ocho rios tours. Was brilliant!
Excellent,"Love this place. Great mix of beautiful, fun and slightly scary. Our guide, Troy, was thoroughly helpful and although funny made us feel totally safe. Would thoroughly recommend"
Second visit in 2 years with Marvyns paradise tours,Last time we came to the blue hole in ocho rios Jamaica was July 2017.  Loved it then and still love it now.  We contracted Marvyns paradise tours as our private service for 2 people.  Our driver and guide was named Gregory.  Gregory is an excellent guide and fulfilled all our wishes.   The falls are no where near as crowed as Dunns Falls and much more entertaining.  Go before the crowds catch on.  Afterwards we went to a small beach next to the Couples resort that was perfect for a quick beach stop.  A restaurant was available and the food was very good.  Marvyns Paradise tours has yet to disappoint.. I really recommend them.  You can find this service on Viator but I recommend going straight to Marvyns web site and dealing with Maryvn or his wonderful wife Sana directly.  They tailor your trip to your needs and are very affordable.
Beautiful natural wonder!,"We drove here ourselves with a local. He helped us navigate and deflect the inevitable crowds outside any major tourist destination, got us right to where we needed to be and with a good guide. Plan to stay a good part of the day here to enjoy the natural beauty that Jamaica has to offer in so many places. You kind of start closer to the bottom of the river and as you wind your way up, there are so many spots to swim for a while, chill, have a fresh jelly coconut, Red Stripe, or whatever else. I'm not sure if it required (it may be), but we chose to get a guide who follows along, help show you the best way to go, and can take pictures for you at all of the amazing stops. I would recommend it. There are beautiful falls, pools of natural mineral water to swim in, cliffs to dive off of, ropes to swing off of and land in the water. A truly AMAZING experience. You will NOT be sorry. Since it is all natural and you are basically going up hill, it is kind of a workout, but the guide will help you and not rush you. You can totally do it at your own pace and hang out at any spot you want for as long as you want. We spent most of the day there, but if you are ""in a hurry""- which is really against all things Jamaican- you can do it in 2 1/2 to 3 hrs. Having been to other falls in Jamaica, I planned from the get go to spend most of the day there and was so glad we did. Felt totally chill and relaxed after soaking in the mineral water. Would highly recommend this place."
My favorite part of Jamaica! ,"So glad we chose to do this excursion!  It was lots of fun, the water was refreshing, and the views were spectacular!!"
Great tour guide Romain,Thank you to Romain for a fantastic experience around the Blue Hole. You made us feel safe and cared for at all times and got some fantastic photos for us! We’d 100% recommend.
Fantástico!,Lugar maravilhoso com muitos saltos para fazer. Guias espetaculares ( Ty and Leroy) that helped us through the rough paths and showed us the best spots :)
A hidden beauty,"Absolutely a beautiful place to visit.  If you are staying in Jamaica, make sure you go on a day when no cruise ships are in town. You want to enjoy without the crowd."
New owners of blue hole,I have been visiting here for 30 years.  Films have been done here..and university of West Indies found it is 150 deep. Many rumors were that it was bottomless. There is a new restaurant adjacent. The old Rasta guy is still there and can take you to a nearby beach. The blue hole is nice for a swim. It is an icon of port antonio.
One of the best places in Jamaica,"It was our first time in Jamaica, its one of the best trips we had so far.Blue Hole is definitely must to visit in Jamaica. We have our private driver that drove us there (It was driver from Pablo Tours) first impression was like - Where are we? Some wild place that was not looked like place for tourists, but when we met locals and took a local guide - it became awesome. We had stunning trip through sort of jungles to water falls. While visiting that place you will experience the nature of Jamaica, you will jump into the several water falls, you will swim to climb to top of them, you will use rope to jump as well and more, and more attractions.We was supper lucky and experienced that with rain and thunder, it was like you are just alone with nature, awesome feeling. Great place, one of the best places I visited so far.Definitely would recommend it for people who would like to experience Jamaica nature and some sort of jumping from cliff experience."
Lots of fun in the nature!,I’ve been to Ocho Rios before but never been to Blue hole. So we decided to go there from Mobay.We took route taxi from down town in Ocho. It’s costs around 500J$. When you get there tour guides waited us. But we didn’t hire because my boyfriend knew the place. If you are traveling alone it’s worth it hire for security. I purchased water shoes at the shop it was J$1000. It’s not necessary but better to have one. Inside blue hole there are many pools. Our favorite one was the near the entrance because there is rope swing so we played with it. We are over 40’s couple but we totally forgot our age and played like child!!!
IT WAS AWESOME!,"First time at the venue...excellent place....had a blast....tour guide Ryan Beach was courteous, helpful and professional. Will definitely visit again...."
Your experience is heavily dependent on your tour guide,"I have visited Blue Hole twice; the first time was with my husband and the other time with my family. I must say the first experience was much better than the second due mainly to our guide. The first guide was very knowledgeable and funny. He made sure we had a blast and doubled as our photographer and took us some dynamite pics. The second guide while not the worst just did not measure up and whereas after my first experience I went and told my family we had to make a trip of it, after the second trip my family and I felt we could take it or leave it. The place is beautiful but be aware that there are entrances below the ‘real’ blue hole entrance marketing themselves as blue hole. To a first time visitor, this might be confusing. And it’s quite a hike so be prepared for that and I definitely recommend water shoes. Your Tour guide will definitely make the difference between a five star and a three star review. Good luck!"
Loved it,"Our third visit and our guide was Little T. This young man is personable, safety minded and professional. He made this beautiful place fin and exciting. Loved it!"
Nice,"We did the blue hole with zip line and river tubing excursion.The drive into Ochos Rios was nice. The blue hole was beautiful.   Our guide took us up to the top and we were able to jump into the water from various heights.  The 15ft jump was a bit to much so we opted out of that.We swam in the water, took some pictures before heading off to our next events.It is something to see. Very relaxing if you plan on spending some time just swimming and lounging on the rocks.Wear water shoes or running shoes that are both durable and water proof.  The rocks can get a bit slippery."
"So, So Beautiful","The Blue Hole is definitely a ""you have to see"" experience.  It was so beautiful. Guides will help you up the inclines and to jump off the waterfalls to beautiful, blue waters.  You can relax and enjoy nature here."
Amazing place to visit,Myself and husband went to visit here today mainly to cool down. The river itself is beautiful so calming and relaxing not that you will relax as its non stop climbing to reach even more amazing features of the place. The tour guides do a brilliant job assisting you with every little thing. We had Jerome as our tour guide. If you get a chance ask for him you will not regret it.
"Stunning Views, Breathtaking Jumps!","The Blue Hole was breath taking from start to finish.  We had a group of 30 people that went the day after our wedding.  The guides, Lil T and Durel were awesome at helping us navigate through the waters, rocks and waterfalls.  Definitely recommend wearing water shoes as some of the rocks can be slippery.  The water was chilly but so refreshing!  Our group absolutely loved this excursion and would definitely recommend fitting this into your time in Jamaica!"
Must see,Awesome place to visit. There are several stops on the way that say blue hole but don't be confused. Go all the way to the top and go to the large one. Its pretty awesome and there are several places to jump from. There is a cave behind the falls with mud that makes your skin awesome. There is an entrance fee that gets you a guided tour...or you can book a tour here.
Amazing,"This is by far my favorite excursion in Ocho Rios. It was cool refreshing water, the jumps were not too big which I prefer. The tour guides were very personal and friendly and it was not very busy. I never felt rushed as I have on other various excursions. The resort we stayed at offered Dunns River for free and wouldn’t visit that again as it’s vrry commercialized and over crowded. We’re going back in the middle of September and plan to visit the blue hole with some friends again as we really enjoyed it. We hired a local driver by the name of Duncan Carruthers and he’s taken us on multiple excursions and gave us a really fair rate and exceptional service. Be sure to stop at Scotchies for some jerk for lunch afterwards."
Awesome experience,"Booked our trip via Viator, great price (37 per person) Small groups with two guides. 3 jumps and one swing. Guides took care of you to make sure you are safe. Wear water shoes for grip on the rocks. Photographer took good pictures but wanted 100 bucks for the DVD. We took waterproof camera and took turns. Guide was a lot of fun and if you are in the Ochio Rios area it is a short drive to the attraction.Well we worth a few hours of time."
The real deal!,"Beautiful tropical mountains with cascading waterfalls and classic paradise wash-outs 'blue holes' to enjoy. At nearly sixty-years of age and suffering from a terminal disease, I never dreamed I could enjoy such an experience so much. Thanks to the support and encouragement of the guides, I found myself diving off cliff platforms like I was a young man again. Thank-you so much for the experience of a lifetime 'Little T' and Crew!"
Loved our visit to the blue hole. ,Great day out. My teenagers loved jumping into the water there. The guides were fabulous. Really helpful and friendly. They were happy to take photos and videos of us jumping and assisted us greatly in climbing up the rocks. Take cash as the guides expect tips. Water shoes are required or you can wear your own trainers. We bought water shoes from the blue hole at $15 per pair.   The jumps are around 2m 3m 5m and 8m and there is a rope swing too. Would definitely recommend. Thank you.
Stunning with fun! ,Wow we loved this place. It’s totally unspoilt and new ish to tourists. We got there 8.30 am using the taxi man ‘Eggie’. Getting there early meant for most of the time we were on our own. Lots of jumping into cold pools of water. If your going to Ochos Rios it’s a must.
Worth the Visit and Enjoyable Experience Jumping into The Blue Hole!,"My girlfriend and I came to the Blue Hole with Chukka Adventures as part of a 4 part excursion/activity package. It was the first activity of the day but it was definitely my favorite!It's definitely feasible to do this on your own if you could arrange a taxi from Ocho Rios it's a short 15 minute journey up to the Blue Hole. There are many tour guides when you go up there to help you navigate and show you the many pools, waterfall, and many jump points from certain cliffs. Our guides (Captain Alex and Marlin) were super awesome and understanding that my girlfriend was scared of jumping off the higher points and made sure she was comfortable and safe.'Well worth it to explore this place of nature and all its beauty!"
Better than Dunns River,"Beautiful surroundings, great jumps, lovely guides and food & drink on site and niknaks to buy outside at reasonable prices. Water's freezing, natural falls. A must do excursion!"
Jamician Crew 2019,"This place by far was my best excursion, our guides was the best, they helped us and was on there job the whole time.. They took pics did vidoes for us.. You guys were amazing. Our trip dates was August 20 to the 27."
Blue Hole,Great time! So much fun for the family. Odean was a great guide. He even made my family tropical crowns at the end. Kevin got great shots of the family. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Ocho Rios.
Beautiful,"We had Tyrone as our guide for a family of 7 of varying ages from 18 -59. Tyrone was an absolutely fantastic guide, couldn't fault him. Would definitely come back again just to experience this natural wonder x"
Authentic and Beautiful,"The Blue Hole is a must when you go to Jamaica. Jump in the water and have a laugh with the guides, it’s still a natural beauty and the team make it super fun. Watching them run down the falls and flipping into the water made my day!"
Best time ever,"Recommend this place such a great family activity our tour guide jahmardo was the best great with the kids, reasonably priced all around happy."
Exciting,"You have to be able to swim for this activity, I watched as my husband and granddaughters had a great time, the oldest age 18 and my husband thought it was better than Dunn’s river falls"
Great Place,"We had an amazing time.  I didn't like that they tried to hustle me for photos.  They insisted I leave my phone because if it got damaged or wet they wouldn't be responsible.  So the guide told me that his guy has a camera and would take pictures.  I thought that was great until I saw the pics and heard the ridiculous price.  They wanted $80 (U.S. dollars) for a cd of about 20 pictures.  These pics weren't even of a professional quality.  He had a few action pictures and there was only a handful of pics that I actually liked.  Nevertheless, bring your own phone and buy a waterproof cell phone case.  You'd be better off."
Blue hole best day out !,This was a fab day out well worth every penny plus tip for the guide he was great made the day more exciting and enjoyable the kids loved it 10 &13 year old boys they’ve been talking about it non stop even now we are home in England they had a great time at the blue hole real excitement proper adrenaline rush 👍 will be doing it again in 2020 when we return for our 6 th visit to Jamaica ! ❤️
AMAZING!!,"LOL!!  I am NOT a jumper won't even jump from backyard deck, but jumped and was amazing.  I am 72 and had the BEST guide with climbing, pathways, and literally gave me his hand as needed..made me feel much safer!!! WISH I could remember his name :( young and thin THANK U!! Definitely BRING dry clothes, water shoes and get a locker. True fresh mountain water so chilly, but do able. Would do again in a heartbeat."
Do it!,So beautiful! Get a locker when you arrive and enjoy the scenery. Leave the 📷 📱 and bring dry clothes. It’s so fun if you love jumping off cliffs. The water is cold.
Very Pretty,"I visited Blue Hole White River and ended up being guided my Fathers childhood friend.  This made the experience more personal as well as enjoyable for me. I climbed all the way to the top, lathered myself in Mud lol. I also really loved the waterfalls and pretty blue water.Will be back again and again!"
Great fun,"We booked this excursion through our hotel and had a driver take us over. We were met by a guide who stayed with us throughout the day. He was young and not talkative, so this part could've been much better. He basically just said, ""jump here, do you want to jump"" etc. without any smalltalk. The blue hole itself was awesome. The water is chilly but beautiful and it wasn't crowded on the day we were there. There are several places to jump in, do rope swings, swim, etc all of which were very fun. Only my husband opted to jump from the waterfall but the rest of us weren't pressured to do so. Our family voted this the best excursion on our trip!"
Blue hole trip,"Ricardo was an amazing host in the blue hole excursion trip! Had an amazing time with friends, and loved being in the presence of both the Ricardo’s that guided us through the journey. They even went beyond on securing our personal items and making sure we had fun. Beautiful experience would highly recommend!"
Blue hole,The blue hole was an awesome experience we climbed to the waterfall and were able to jump off of various cliffs and if you were to afraid you could walk back down it was definately a beautiful area the waterfalls were awesome and the photographers were amazing at capturing good moments we loved this tour
Blue hole and river tubing royal carribean tour.,Had an awesome time tour guide Chentile took very good care of us as well as driver Andrew.  The guides on tour were awesome!!!!we had a blast definitely money well spent.
Go to blue hole!,"Based off of people’s recommendations to go to blue hole instead of Dunn’s river, we went for it. We had a group of 11 with us and loved every second. We had a guide/lifeguard that helped us navigate the falls and jumping off the cliffs. We had a few that never would’ve jumped if it wasn’t for the guides. They took photos that we were able to purchase since we couldn’t have phones. Prices were reasonable. They took really good posed photos as well as action shots. We all were glad we did it!!"
Family vacation,It is a must visit when in JamaicaGorgeous and very refreshing We would have loved to stay there longer
AGRESSIVE TOUR GUIDES,my girlfriends and I were recommended  to visit this place by some friends. I was very excited as I had read previous reviews. upon arrival we were greeting by some young men who seem to be very polite. they ask us how are we and gave up a brief run down about the place. the tour started off cool but towards the end got awkward when one of the guy (Shane) ask my friend out. my friend was not interested in him but he was very persisted and even was pushing up on her. we decided to end the tour quick because it became uncomfortable. finding out later from other people that they are very aggressive and most of those guys prey on tourist women. I'm not a person to right reviews but people just be careful. Especially women. they really attack you and if you reject them they get more aggressive. over all the place is nice but I would stand clear of those men Especially if you meet SHANE.. He's no Good
A hidden gem,This is a must to visit the Blue Hole  when we  go there each of us got our own life guard  and it was a real day of fun the water is very deep you have to wear a floating vest and the water  is  very  blue and clean it  it is one of the hidden gem of Ocho Rios it is like you are on your own private  island paradise   enjoying a  day in your pool and garden with your friends  memorable experience   will surely visit again
Gorgeous and refreshing!,"I have gone to many places in and around Ocho Rios, but this place is a highlight for sure! We could have stayed there all day long in the chilly and refreshing blue water. The water falls were gorgeous, the jumps were super fun, and the caves were rad. Impressed and thankful for the tour guide that  walked us from one place to the next without and pressure to hurry along. Some of us loved to jump, some did not, but all had a fantastic time. If I were forced to pick just one destination in Ocho Rios area, this would for sure be the one."
Amazing,This is the best kept secret. I love this place. The tour guides will help you and they are very friendly. I am definitely going back here... Please don't over pack it.. sincerely a true fan of Jamaica
It is a real jungle oasis,"You can relax in the cool water or swim around in the pools that form at the base of the waterfalls. When we went it was not crowed. BUT, be very aware that the rocks leading to the pools are not stairs for the most part but rather slippery and well worn rocks.  Water shoes are suggested, but If you are wearing the basic inexpensive ones it might make it worse than being barefoot. Also, it you have any physical challenges, the climb up and down the short rocky hill should be done with additional care as there are no railings for the most part.  Staff is standing by to assist. Of course, guys there selling photos of you will try to catch you to buy on the way out.  Overall, a fun experience."
Blue Hole was amazing!!!,"This was my first time in Jamaica. I asked the driver on the way to the hotel from the airport what he recommended I see. He made excellent suggestions. He said a lot of people go to Dunn's River, which is nice but the Blue Hole is more fun!!! But was he right!!! BTW- I also went to Dunn's River... Or tour guide Odean was so much fun and took my phone to take all the pictures! I highly recommend you visit the Blue Hole. Ask for Odean too!😊"
Vacay,Incredible experience. Well trained guides taking you through the falls and pools. Damien was our guide and he did an excellent job.
Best Place to go in Ocho Rios,This was the best place we went on our day out.   I could have spent much more time here but had several places to see.   Highly recommend!    They do have life jackets if you wish to jump in and you can also climb the falls.    it was awesome!!
Beautiful!,"Absolutely loved this place! The water is very very cold, but with how hot Jamaica can be it was refreshing. There are multiple tour guides that take you through the multiple layers of falling water safely and you can jump into pools of water from multiple heights with the highest being twenty feet! Tons of fun!"
Beautiful waterfalls and diving off,"My wife, self, 3 sons (21, 19, 17) did this excursion via Byron's Jamaica Tours (reviewed elsewhere and they are awesome!).  As I understand, when you purchase the excursion, that gets you access to the blue hole (it is privately owned).  The owner wants to sell you photos, but it is really expensive and not worth it.  As you go into the area (cordoned off with chain link fence), you then get a guide that goes with your group.  Our driver from Byron's Jamaica Tours, Courtney, got us situated with our guide, Kenny (he always uses Kenny, because he is reliable and very nice).  He was terrific!.  Allow approx 1 hour for this excursion once you get there.  There are bathrooms and a place to change.  Truly incredible series of waterfalls, tarzan ropeswings, jumping off into pools below.  Highest was probably 40' or so.  Beautiful water, Kenny did a great job guiding us upriver and helping us get to amazing sites from which to jump.  Must have water shoes!!!  Note that although privately held, there are definitely some general public there selling various drinks, foot, trinkets, pot.  We didn't tarry.  Kenny was really great and he helped us make memories to keep forever!!  Note that as I understand it, the fee for the excursion only gets you into the Blue Hole.  At your discretion, you should tip the guide (he is not paid by the Blue Hole ownership)."
Wow!!!!,This was our favourite place! It’s simply beautiful! We loved Dunn’s but this was even better!!! Troy was our guide he was fantastic!
So much fun,"The guides will take your hand and help you every step of the way. They’ll encourage you to do things you can’t do and if you can’t do them, they don’t judge. They walk you back down to an area where you do feel comfortable jumping. Wonderful guys! Bring water shoes and a waterproof camera because the scenery is beautiful. Bring some cash too bc there were guys in the falls selling Red stripe for $5. Nice refreshing drink after your climbing and jumping. Would definitely do it again! The swing was so much fun!"
Blue hole thru chukka,"Little T was our blue hole guide and he was nothing short of AMAZING! He was funny, encouraging and knowledgeable."
Nervous... But you will love it.,"Make sure to grab a life jacket..... I love the place my partner under estimated this place and found out he needed  a life jacket. If you love to jump off cliffs, swing into the unknown blue water this place is a must try. I scenery was amazing the lush green landscape that opens up to the pretty blue water is amazing. Guides are for friendly don’t mind help you out with either words of encouragement or giving you a ride accross the pond."
Visit to Jamaica,"It was not that great, I do not know why they call it a blue hole.Spent $200 on a taxi to reach there but was very disappointed as there was nothing to see. I will not recommend this place to anyone."
Go Jump Off a Rock,We had a great time ath the Cool Blue Hole out of Ocho Rios. Our guides treated us well and made sure we felt safe climbing up the falls. Just go there early before all the tours show up.
Awesome trip for all ages!,"Our guide, Javier, was really great with all group, awesome experience, you will not regret. You need water shoes!"
Beautiful location,"We visited the Blue Hole in July with Tui. Our guide, I think his name was Trey, was great, very helpful and did not put pressure on anybody to jump. As a non-swimmer, I mostly just watched my partner and kids from the sidelines and took photos but they seemed to really enjoy the jumps and swimming. The guides will give you a life-jacket if you aren't a strong swimmer. Water shoes with grips are essential as the rocks can be very slippy, and a waterproof phone case if you want to take pictures. Family had a good experience and would recommend to anybody with a sense of adventure."
Best of Ochi Tour,"Went there as part of an excursions with Sandals Ochi. Had a blast, Glen and Andre (guides) where awesome throughout the tour."
Good fun - not for the faint hearted,"This was fun and the kids loved it.  But it does consist of some big plunging jumps from good heights into deep pools of fresh water. You need water shoes. They have life jackets if you want, not compulsory. In a family of four, my wife elected to be photographer rather than chief jumper..."
Beautiful Waterfalls,"Visited with the family and had a great time diving into the clear waters (even though the initial plunge was COLD) which was refreshing.   The guides were very helpful, entertaining and best of all, great with the kids.   You have the option to skip jumping from any of the platforms as they do not pressure and/or rush you."
A Must!,Definitely a highlight of our visit to Jamaica.  It’s a bit of hiking/walking and climbing rocks.  Probably best for kids at least 7-8 years old.  Water is chilly and absolutely stunning.  I’m so glad we went!
Absolutely beautiful place,"We booked our trip through Thomas Cook rep, our guide was Julian, he showed us the jumps and rope swings, this truly is a beautiful place. I had a panic attack and couldn't jump, Julian was very helpful getting me back down and making sure I was alright, the rocks can be very slippy so water shoes are a must. My daughter did all the ju,ps, she's a dare devil and thoroughly enjoyed it, I would definitely return."
Fun Time but Too Short,Fun time with the waterfall and jumping but too short.  Would've liked to have spent more time there.  Guide was great and you didn't have to jump if you didn't want to.  Jumps were fun at varying heights.  There were some very slippery spots and deep holes to get hurt on that we weren't warned about.  I scraped my leg a few times.****if you book through AMSTAR and are coming from Secrets St James/Wild Orchid resort they don't tell you that the trip to Blue Hole takes 3 hours EACH WAY and you don't go to Usain Bolt's restaurant for lunch.  You are taken to a Chinese/Indian restaurant and given the choice of jerk or fried chicken for lunch.  Not worth it even though the driver and guide were awesome.  Would not do it again because we were only at Blue Hole for an hour.
Great Adventure and Semi-Physical,"We visited the Blue Hole with a private tour guide. The property is about 10-15 minutes from Dunns River Falls. The cost is $20.00 to enter the facility. YOU NEED WATER SHOES!. You're given vests for floating. You don't need a towel, camera or anything to carry. You're going to walk through trails, that are carved out through the trees.At the first hole, you can jump from the rocks. The next jump/dive/plunge is swinging from the ropes and plunging into the water. It's fun, exhilarating and the water is cold.  There is a small cave at the hole to stand and have pictures taken. THE PROBLEM - THE PHOTOGRAPHERS - BEWARE OF A PRICING SCAM The photographer tried to sell me the disk with our photos for $150.00 U.S. Dollars, then $125.00, then $100.00. He did not get a sale and we had our underwater camera.  Then, up the mountain trail to the second area, where there's a beautiful waterfall. Some of our group dived from the higher platforms, climbed down the waterfall and dived, or chose to take the smallest plunge, off the side of the rocks. At the end, a different photographer and reasonable cost of $60.00 for the disk and the photos were also e-mailed. Thanks to our tour guides Darrin and Andrew. Great Job!  Lastly, there are small, local vendors along the paths. You can make purchases while touring and the money is collected at the end of the excursion.  Your tour guides will take the cash back to the vendors. PLEASE TIP YOUR TOUR GUIDES."
BAD,My Son was hurt doing a jump and still hasn't recovered. Staff were rude and were annoying by showing off 5 times before letting us do a jump one time
Blue Hole ADVENTURE,".Guided by the Mr. Waterbird aka Brown Man himself. After our little chat I discovered the right man for the job..He has mastered his craft and is still vibrant and excited about showing us this amazing falls. He  knows the history and guaranteed an amazing experience, and that it was. You would think it's his home then again he has been there over 20 years..Be sure to look out for him when you visit and nice up the tip😉..#summer2019#firststop#bluehole#ochoriosjamaica #stmary#ontheborder#living#jamaica#attractions#tours#travel#visitjamaica"
Be prepared to climb-Do NOT go as a spectator,"By the excursion descriptions, I was expecting that my 5 year old daughter and I could sit in the water while others climbed and jumped.  This was not the case.  We started by climbing up part of the falls.  We came across another group that was sitting and watching people jumping, so I thought, oh, we can sit here.  When I started to head into the water, our guide said no, that we were going somewhere else.  This was not true.  They sat us in a part of the falls for a photo op and then it was time to jump, exactly the same place the others were jumping and sitting.  The guide said we could go back down, so I'm already irritated.  I navigated myself and my daughter down, but we were not able to sit in the water at this time.  Down to the next section, more jumping.  Then back to the entry, and to another jump.  I asked if there was a way my daughter and I could go to the bottom without jumping and they told us to wait.  Finally, after my group all jumps in, a guide tells me about the path to the bottom.  I think he just didn't want us to mix with another group, which was stupid because we've already paid and we're not going to be confused about which group we're in since they were family.  We get to the bottom, which you can climb in where everyone else is climbing out.  By the time I got my daughter into the water and to a rock to try to take a picture, the guide said we were leaving-did not get the picture.  Maybe if I had given him some money up front, he would have let us go to the bottom first.  In any case, it's not relaxing, so if you're coming to be a spectator, just don't.  The people jumping really enjoyed it, so I made this review as more of a warning that I wish I had known."
Amazing!,"This excursion was one of my favorites.  You hike in the jungle area, meeting many locals along the way  And then you hike UP towards the top of the area only to jump into multiple pools of water.  The water is freezing but somehow your body becomes accustomed to it.  The trail can be dangerous but this crew is top notch!  They will guide you up the dangerous rocks, never leaving your side.  They will amaze you with their talents for navigating up the slopes, diving in the water, and then beating you up the slopes again!  Mr. Campbell was our tour guide and he was on point."
The BEST time!,"We went as an excursion from our Royal Caribbean cruise. Our guide, Courtney, was so fun and it was GORGEOUS!!!! The water was refreshingly cool on the hot July day. I thought it was just a swim hole with rocks to jump from into the water. I had no clue we would have a guide to help us climb, hold our hand on the slippery parts, tell us the best place to put our foot, etc. They kept the pace moving without us feeling rushed. The guides appreciate being tipped, of course, but they were in no way pushy about it. This is something our family truly enjoyed and will remember forever. Try to get Courtney as a guide and be on his ""A team,"" as he called us."
Incredible,Blue Hole was a once in a lifetime experience.  It is gorgeous to look at.  Jumping off cliffs into beautiful blue water while coming down the waterfalls took courage but ended up being so much fun!
Brilliant place to visit,"One of our favourite places to visit during our stay - Our guides Jay and his side kick were really helpful, safety conscious and fun!! Thank you for a great experience"
Blue Hole Girls Excursion,By far the best excursion on our trip with great staff. Kenny and other tour guide was super amazing with our group and taking pictures.
A must see!!!,"Did this with a family of four out 15 yo son and 17 yo daughter myself and my husband loved it!! Climb rocks, jump off cliffs into beautiful water!"
Better than Dunn’s River,Talk about true beautiful blue. This tour was one of our all time favorites. Our guides were Daniel and friends they were so awesome. We booked it through Mello Tours Jamaica. Definitely ask to go to the top of the river first before skylarking in the bottom river springs. The water was cold but you get use to it. The fresh waterfalls are so beautiful. Avoid the gentleman with the photos. He is super rude and pushy. They take photos while in the water and he hassles to get them printed on a CD. We patronized purely because he wouldn’t leave us alone but he definitely did not get that we had phones. Who needs printed CD’s anymore!Swim shoes and water proof phone case is a must.
Slightly Disappointed,"We booked this tour at our hotel through Season's Tours.  We were picked up by Joseph at 9:55 along with three other couples.  Along the way, we picked up more people.  One stop was suppose to have 2 people but we ended up with 8 people.  Upon arriving at the Blue Hole, we had to stay in the van until 2 clipboards (consent forms) were signed.  A suggestion would be to have the clipboards in the van, circulating as people are picked up.  This would alleviate the 15 to 20 minutes of wasted time (we were not allowed to get off the bus until we had signed).  We really had no idea that there were areas of hiking and jumping (15 feet and 20 feet and a smaller jump into the water).  This, of course, was photo opportunity.  After the Blue Hole, we drove to the White Water Rafting where we were furnished with a hard hat and vest, then we had to get back in the van and go to the start of the rafting.  Here we waited 15 to 20 minutes for the truck to deliver the tubes.  It appeared to be disorganized from the get go.  I must say that there was a couple of rapids, but more like the slowest lazy river ever.  Going home, traffic was horrendous due to the Sun Fest which no one told us about.  We were suppose to get back at 2:30 but we did not get back until 6:10.  It did not help that Joseph pulled over on the side of the road to get a Mountain Dew for a whining lady who did nothing but talk about having a Mountain Dew since 10:00 that morning.  And no  she was NOT diabetic.  There were plenty of opportunities to buy food/drink of which she did buy a beer.  Stopping did not go over well with people wanting to get back to their resorts.  This activity was $120.00 per person (not including lunch).  Go on your own to the Blue Hole and skip the rapids!  And skip Chukka!"
The absolute BEST!!,"Literally the best adventure in Jamaica in my opinion. Be sure to book with your resort because it can get a little rough when you get up there but once you are in it is so amazing! I have never seen anything so beautiful! We did the river tubing afterwards which was alright but the blue hole was everything. Make sure to tell them you want to take your own pictures. Find someone friendly(someone that came with you, not the locals) there that will take them for you. Water shoes are a must and we bought water protector phone necklace things that were awesome! We got some really good pics."
Beautiful Water,We just did the Blue Hole without the zip line etc. It was fantastic!The water was beautiful! The staff was great!
Beautiful,"We booked a number of trips via Chukka this was by far the best, the tubing that went along side this wasn't very good, we would have preferred to spend the whole day at the blue hole, the tour operator basically hurries you through each level of the waterfall and there is no time to explore or relax, i would recommend making your own way there privately, you will have more time and it will cost you less.The blue hole is stunning and we loved it, even jumping from the highest point ( given our age 50's) we felt rather brave. we aware some people jumped with GoPros that ended up lost at the bottom of the plunge pool due to the force of hitting the water from the higher jumps"
THE BLUE HOLE,The adventure of a lifetime. Go. You won’t be sorry. Such beauty. Take a private tour guide and visit where the tour busses can’t go.
Worth the time to see,Excellent excursion would highly recommend. Be sure to wear water shoes and bring a towel (lockers available if needed). Water is very refreshening
Beautiful Cool Pools,"I ventured to this location on my own in my rental car.  Before I even arrived I was approached by some very aggressive local guides competitor to guide me, they one I picked led me down to park.  I was told that he could not charge me a st price but I could donate what I thought he was worth.  The walk to the falls was beautiful, we approached it from underneath and did not go up to the top although there were many people up there. If I did this again I would definitely want to go that way.I swam in the hole and eventually climbed up the cliff to jump from the approximately 15ft platform.  It was terrifying to me but I survived and had fun at the same time.  The hardest part is leaving the platform but there was a man up there that gave you a little push if needed."
Great fun,"I didn't really know what to expect from this attraction, as I hadn't done any research.The attraction looks like it needs more investment, however the guides made it safe and fun. One for all the family to have a go.Following the clear instructions made if flow very smoothly, jumping into the multi levelled pools. Including the use a rope swing towards the end.A special mention goes out to the guide how dived back into a pool to retrieve a mobile phone that had came off the neck rope as the clip broke. Phone returned safely, still in the waterproof cover."
Wow breathtaking!!!!,"Highly recommend this if you want to see a beautiful waterfall without the tourist crowds. It is such a beautiful spot to just relax and take in the view. You will get a guide who will take your camera and take pictures if you want which I did and it was worth it, just tipped the guy at the end. The water is beautiful and refreshing. Great experience!!!!"
Great Experience,"My family and I visit Jamaica every year and never made our way to Blue Hole as we recently learned about it. Needless to say, this was such a great experience! So much fun, the guides are entertaining and ensures that everyone is safe when jumping. I didn’t jump lol but my family had a blast, will definitely visit again. Make sure to bring your water shoes, waterproof phone cases and spf!"
Beyond Beautiful,Blue hole is a little hidden gem.  We have been to Jamaica many times and have done all the recommended places previously so to learn about this excursion was a blessing. We took 9 people age range from 10-69 and all enjoyed it and were able to participate at their given level.  With that many people we organized our own “tour”. They took us to Blue Hole complete with our own tour guide Nico with a stop at Juicys (for patties)before going back to our resort.  Blue Hole is a waterfall/river where you climb up and do a series of jumps back down from cliffs and a zip swing into the final pool then you walk back to the actual Blue Hole pool to swim and swing zip into the gorgeous water. There were not many people there as it has only been open to the public for 7 years and is not YET a popular attraction. It cost $15 pp to get in. Bring water shoes and nothing else except a waterproof camera.  They have a photographer that will follow you up and position you for family photos available for purchase at the end but we were able to take the same pictures ourselves. Be honest with them from the start if you are going to purchase photos at the end and if not they won’t follow you.  Highly recommend this visit!!
Excursion ,"My family and I did the Blue Hole excursion.  It was pretty neat and fun. I enjoyed the mineral water, mud bath and watching everyone jump into the water. Our tour person Fabian was absolutely amazing! The only thing I disliked is that the rocks are soooo slippery. You really have to be careful. The tour person was good for warning us and he even helped us across many of them."
Blue Hole,"Uncle Mike and Captain Robert were the best. We had a blast, and they took really good care of us. My teenagers loved it, and it is a beautiful gem on the island."
GREAT EXPERIENCE,Such a cool place. I have never even jumped off a diving board but I did this. Not the last two (too scared lol) but really great experience. Would definitely go again.
For those with a sense of adventure......,"What a beautiful place to enjoy a little adventure in the form of some jumps at various levels in a number of blue water deep pools. Guided by locals, they take you to different levels that allow your to jump from high to low, even a small rope swing. Water is refreshing, and the location has snacks and bathrooms for changing."
A Must! Request Captain Alex!! ♥️,"One of the best excursions we have ever been on. We booked through TripAdvisor > Viator > Chris. I received a prompt call and great customer service.Our driver, Kelly, was on time and gave us a great overview of the island! Our falls guide was Captain Alex. He is very good and knows the falls very well. Every rock and step - he was about safety and then fun. He encouraged and motivated us to push ourselves. My son (9) was so happy and did well while I was so scared. Captain Alex was truly amazing and I will request him when I go back! Now I didn’t expect to pay so much for the pictures ($60) and it is very overpriced. I read someone else paid $50 so we should have haggled more. Remember this:- bring cash- the guides are worth tipping extra, especially Captain Alex!- it’s cold- it’s worth it - they have free life jackets - get one. I can swim pretty well and I didn’t get one. But I fell so far in the water that it took me a long time to get to the surface. I started to panic alittle.- have someone take pictures who is too scared to jump to avoid the crazy picture fee."
Refreshing and fun!,"Me and my wife had this as a part of a four part day outing. They were fun, friendly and very attentive!"
Highlight of the trip,"The family visited the Blue Hole and had the best experience on our trip so far.  We stayed in Ocho Rios and drove ourselves.  Pass up the gauntlet of local vendors trying to stop you claiming they are the “true” blue hole destination and take yourself up to the Fern Gully stop.  This is the Tourist approved Blue hole entrance.  All the other stops would require you to walk up the mountain and go through the “Bush”.Our guide was Odean, and he was amazing.  He took us to all the spots and even took our pictures with my wife’s iPhone.He took my adventuresome boys all around and had them diving off the edges in no time.  The water was so blue & refreshing.  Great memories, thanks to Odean!My boys want to come back already!!!Bring cash only, waterproof case for your phone for pics, and watershoes.  Leave everything else behind and go have fun!!!!"
Day Excursion,"Simply amazing! We visited Blue Hole and Island Gully Falls. After climbing the falls at Blue Hole and jumping the rocks, we tubed down the river and saw incredible flora. The guides on both tours were hospitable and entertaining. The water was gorgeous and refreshing. We were in a small group so the tour was much more intimate than some of the other destiations in Jamaica. Tip the guides and make sure to give a couple bucks to the kids on the tube ride . (They don't work there officially, but they work their hearts out to make sure your trip is enjoyable.)"
Awesome,"Call Orville a.k.a ""Top Shelf""    1-876-867-0647#1  Guide in ocho rios area. He will make sure that you and your family have the best time for the least money!  Go anytime you want without a bus full of tourists. No lines, no waiting!"
Blue Hole - beautiful natural experience ,Great experience! The hike was not for the weak! But it was worth it. Watershoes are a must. Our tour guide suggested we go here instead of Dunn’s River. A lot more private and less congested with tourists. Tour operators helped us when needed and even brought life vests just in case we needed them. Great service!
Blue Hole,Shannon and ONeil  was our tour guide and bus driver .When we got to blue hole in the river we had Daniel and Devon they were fun very helpful kept us comfortable and safe. The whole family absolutely loved it
Must do!,Our favorite part of our trip. Everyone was so friendly and jumping off the water fall was absolutely amazing. We hired a private guide that took great care of us.
Jumped - NOT,Beautiful falls with very friendly and fun guides.  Our guide even helped us to carry the kids over the rocky river terrain.  My daughter in law jumped several times and hiked all the way upstream.  We did not eat anything while we were there.  We would definitely return and it is great for adventurous types.
"Breath-taking, Fun","We enjoy every aspect of it, way more of a adventure that Dunns River. Our tour guide ""Ricardo"" was amazing!!! and take the best pics ever. Don't be afraid to take ur younger(5,6 etc.) kids there, from our experience they know how to make everyone enjoy their visit."
Gorgeous but rushed,"What an amazing adventure this was even with a 6 year old non swimmer. We had a tour guide (Wilson) and a young girl. They showed as around the falls safely and we enjoyed the jumps. We felt it was a bit rushed and could have easily spent more time there, it seemed they wanted the tour done quickly so they could be tipped (Wilson) not the girl. Even with a $20 tip he was disappointed and was looking for more. This slightly tainted the trip. We purchased the disc of pictures that the tour guide took at a cost of $50."
Breath taking,"The people are amazing, the most beautiful place in the world, the water is so  blue, it's a must see."
What an adventure!,We arrived at Blue Hole last week during our cruise.  Our private tour guide was Marvyn's Paradise Tours.  We were introduced to Captain Alex!  What a great guide. He led us past the cruise ship tour groups to the head of the line. I was unsure how my family would do with this excursion since the jumps can be quite high.  Captain Alex reassured my family at each jump. We never felt in danger and Captain Alex did a great job with my teenage kids making sure they were comfortable at each jump.  My family is still raving about what an awesome day we had at Blue Hole!  Thank you again to Captain Alex for an unforgettable adventure in Jamaica!
Unbelievable!,This was by far the best excursion we have ever done! Our guide was Romaine. He was the absolute best! He greeted us as soon as we arrived and took our camera! The pictures and videos we took of our experience are absolutely amazing! Some of the photos and videos look like a professional had taken them! The stories he told of how this Blue Hole came to be were amazing. He truly cares about ensuring you have the best time. We will definitely take this tour again and ask for him! Our taxi driver told us that the Blue Hole was much better that Dunn’s River Falls. We told everyone at the resort they needed to do the Blue Hole instead! Would definitely recommend this over the Dunn River Falls! Can’t wait to go again!
Fantastic,"I’m so glad a friend recommended it and I went there early in the morning. I was the first tourist to get in. The serenity and the beauty of the place is breathtaking. It was also a quick trip from Ocho Rios, I even took a local cab that headed to Gayle and just asked the driver to drop me by Blue Hole. It was a pretty smooth trip. As a solo female traveler, you might get hit on a lot, but I found a way out of it."
Nature at it's best,"A friend recommended I book this trip with GOTO Tours, I am so happy I did. I  had the best time. First,the owner and operator Garfield was very friendly and really knows his stuff. He really loves what he does and it shows. He is a safe driver and a very fun guy. This little peace of heaven was breathtakingly beautiful. The entry fee was only $15.00 and goes to preserving this little gem. I do recommend this place to everyone, I also suggest bringing cash for a tip (the guides do not get a regular pay cheque and relay solely on tips). I found that water shoes really helped when climbing the rocks and stairs. I would like to thank Garfield so much for being such a great Tour Guide and look forward to going with you on more tours in the future. I highly recommend GOTO Tours to anyone who goes to Jamaica...he is the best! 1-876-413-00431 Comment2 Shares"
Fun time at the Blue Hole,"We took a private tour that took us to the Blue Hole.  Once we were there our group was guided by Guthrie (Julian).  He did a great job with our kids 8 & 9, showing them what to do and where to jump from.  Guthrie also used our camera to take pictures and we got some great photos.  We didn't buy the ones they take and sell.  The Blue Hole was a beautiful stop on our tour and I would highly recommend it.  It wasn't too crowded and we spent about an hour there, but could have stayed as long as we wanted.  We had a wonderful day in Jamaica, extremely satisfied with our experience!"
Fun Place with Multiple Jumps,"There are actually several places you can jump in the water here.  From the description, I was thinking there was the one rope swing and then you would get to walk around and swim.  It is not really like that.  You are with a guided group that goes from one jump to the next.  A couple of the jumps were too high for me, so I skipped them.  This is definitely one of the places to go in Ocho Rios, and everyone had a lot of fun; but I was expecting something a bit different, so this wasn't in my top three excursions."
Jamaica Vacation,Great place to visit it a most do if you go to Jamaica be carful with the person that take pictures there not that good and it has a cost of 80 USD for the CD!
Awesome TIme,We loved our guide Odean.  He was fun and he made sure everyone was safe!  This was a highlight of the trip.
the blue hole tours,I w ent to the blue hole tours it was amazing the tour guide was great he took me to the swining roap and said jump I landed in the water below it was wonderful then he took us up the trail to the falls wow it was marvilious I really have to do it again
Refreshing fun adventure,"Great Experience for all ages. Terrain is tough. Make sure you bring money for photos, we didnt and it is our biggest regret of our entire trip."
Beautiful falls & water,"Very attentive guide, quite a walk to the falls. Beautiful turquoise water and amazing falls to see. An interesting ""mud cave"" to experience and a high platform to jump into the water below!! Awesome!! One of a kind experience!"
Must do while in Jamaica!,"Our favorite thing so far in Jamaica! Beautiful views, refreshing water, and tons of adventure. We definitely would not have enjoyed it as much as we did without our guide Javier. He was amazing! Javier was very attentive, helped us throughout the hike and also took tons of photos for us. We will visit the blue hole again that is for sure!"
Blue whole,Staff wad so great! Kourtney was so patient and kind! I was so scared to jump but he made it easy The water was so pretty! Breathtaking!!
Perfect refreshing swim,"Would you like to enjoy pure nature of Jamaica? Do you prefer swimming in cold lakes instead of warm sea? This is for you!! The guides are very professional and helpful and provide you even some adrenaline but really safe jumping from rocks and bridges. They also take pictures of you in the water, don't worry to give them your phone - we were worried about it, but they are really professional and experienced. This is also the reason, why they deserve a nice tip after the tour.But before swimming/jumping, take off your jewelry (rings, bracelets...), the lakes are very deep and if you lose them in the water, you cannot find them anymore. Unfortunately, I lost my wedding ring, because I forgot to be careful enough. I noticed that in an hour after the trip - when you jump into the water, the waterflow is so strong that you will not feel loosing it. But it was only my fault, the nature and service of the staff is really worth!!"
Worth the time!!,"Ask for Nicholas as a guide when you go. It is $20 per person  but he will make the trip informative as well as fun. He had a camera  man take pictures of us so we could buy them for $60 US$, and they came out Great. There is a waterfall that you can jump off into the blue water. So amazing!!"
Family Vacation Fun,"Blue Hole was amazing! We had the best guide ever, Little T. My boys, Travis and Trey loved him. He went above and beyond to make our experience. He interacted and made it so our family had the best time ever. I recommend he fully!"
Sensacional - Amazing,"This place is amazing. It is great for pictures. If you have water shoes, don't forget to include them in your luggage, because the administration won't let you get in if you don't have a pair of those. But there's a store on the entrance to buy a pair (coincidence???).We went in with the guide ROBERT. Great guy, funny and knows the place very well. He'll keep you safe when walking on the waterfalls and will show the best spots for pictures (like hidden mini caves underwater)."
Great Fun,"On a cruise in 6/2019, and found this on ShoreTrips rather than through the cruise line.  Glad we did.  First we did a river rapids (very easy) ride and everyone, from our Tour Guide Dwayne ""The Rock"" to the people sitting along the banks was so pleasant and fun.  We left the river rapids and went to the Blue Hole.  What an amazing adventure.  Not nearly as crowded as Dunn's River Falls and you actually get to jump from a lot of different platforms.  I did 4 out of 5 and my 16 year old did all 5.  Little T is a great guide at Blue Hole if you go.  Loved it and will do it again if get back to Jamaica!"
Blue Hole,"WE hired a driver who took us here and didnt join the tour. IT wAS AweSOME. We didnt have to wait in the ""tout"" lines or ride the ""tour"" bus. we got to move at our own pace.....which was quicker than waiting on all the tourists"
2019 trip to JA,"Never heard about this location until we arrived in Jamaica. When we conquered Dunn’s river we were told about this place. I had to remind myself I was still in Jamaica when we were touring this location. Our guide AKA Dragon was amazing and not hard on the eyes either. Very knowledgeable about the location, the temperature at the blue hole felt like 75, we hike climbed jump and had a clay bath, 200 Minimum at spa for that clay. Lush vegetation throughout this location. I’m not a swimmer but this place has plenty of life vest. I jumped twice. I don’t regret a moment here. Btw woman tour guides are also available. Bring a flag from your country so they can hang it. Bucket list blue hole check"
Great fun and awesome photo ops,Had a great time here with the family. Unlike Dunn's River you're able to jump into the water. Everyone enjoyed being able to do so. Our guide was real nice and attentive.
Best day ever,Our driver Donna took us and we had a great guide awesome day jumping into water from platform and rocks and ropes what a blast we had can't wait to come again
Unreal views but quite scary,I am glad I went but wouldnt go back. Really needs the goverment to take over to ensure is safe for visitors. Climbing over broken glass the tour guides drinking beer. We were quite scared at parts. The place itself is stunning but felt unsafe.
Beautiful Falls and adrenaline rush jump,"Blue hole taught me that first impressions don’t always last. At first getting to this place was not attractive. The car park was not properly laid out or clearly defined even the process to be admitted left much to the nervous. However, once we were inside, the two guides assigned to us was nothing short of amazing. They took us to two areas one where you can swing from a tree into the water another was to climb up a cliff and jump into the water close to the falls. The guides also showed us various plants and herbs in cooking and explain how it can be used in Jamaican cuisine. It is a lovely place and the hospitality shown to us was amazing. Don’t let first impressions (parking, entrance) deter your visit."
Blue Hole,"The family (three of us including 13yr old son) drove over from Trelawny.  Staff recommended Blue Hole over Duncan Falls (wife had been there before).  So glad we did.  Not crazy crowded, staff was amazing with very intimate attention.  There’s a photographer with you, but there’s not a big pressure push at end for purchasing pics or anything else.  Go all the way to top of road where the licensed facility is,  best holes.  We highly recommend Javier as a guide, as well....he was awesome!"
Awesome place,The Blue Hole is a jump off small cliff paradise. Be prepared for walking and slipping as this isn't as commercial as you would believe.
Stunning!,"We booked a Blue Hole excursion directly from Sandals Resort. It was called ""The Best of Ocho Rios"" It included zip-lining, tubing the White River, Dune Buggy's and The Blue Hole. The pictures here on this site does not do the color of the water justice. The guides at the Blue Hole were very helpful and always there to lend a hand or take a picture for you. The way the tour here works is they lead you along the falls at different places to jump in. They didn't explain too much about the jumping until you were already up there in place. So while you are on the ground, if you aren't looking to jump ""LET THEM KNOW!"" The water itself is stunning. I wish we had time to just chill and hang out in the water but it was a more jump, and move along. I am so glad we did this. It wasn't overly crowded, the cruises usually bus everyone towards Dunns River Falls so this was a pleasantly relaxed area. The highest jump point is 20ft!! Would definitely recommend this stop to anyone heading to Jamaica."
Such a Beautiful Place!,"My wife and I decided to do an excursion and we picked the Blue Hole, which was truly amazing! It is so beautiful there with the blue water and all the waterfalls, big and small. Just very relaxing and refreshing. There are places you can dive from and also rope swings, which were fun to do but also fun to just relax in the pool and watch others. The local guys will do flips and all kinds of jumps and dives. We had a private guide, Lloyd, and he was GREAT! He made sure we didn't do anything we shouldn't do and helped us do everything we wanted to do, but there was No rush and No worries!!! Lloyd was a Great guide for sure and if we ever go back, I will try to get him as our guide again. The Blue Hole truly is a beautiful place! Thanks for an amazing adventure!"
DON’T GET SCAMMED ON THE PHOTOS,"Family group of 9 visited on June 6th. The place is beautiful, we had pictures taken, we bought the CD and only 1/2 the photos were on the cd.It was an older man.We called the Blue Hole........No help!!"
Honeymoon excursion,"My husband and I were looking for a fun excursion to go on while on our Jamaican Honeymoon. We decided to book a visit through Chukka to The Blue Hole, and we are so happy we did. It was the most amazing trip!! The water is beautiful, our guide Julian was amazing, and the cliff jumping was very fun. The trip includes climbing a few waterfalls, jumping off three “cliffs” (3M, 7M, 10M high), sitting in a cave under the waterfall, and hanging off a rope swing.  A must for the trip: tip money, water shoes (you cannot go on the waterfalls without water shoes), swim suit, and a waterproof phone case or bag if you want to take pictures. Do not take: sunglasses, hats, jewelry, or anything else you don’t want to lose while cliff jumping. Thank you Julian for a great tour!!"
Beautiful!,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect except a blue hole!  I ended up being lead around by my guide, jumping into amazing clear water holes!  The photos don't do the beauty of the place justice!!"
Girls day out,We had girls day out to the blue hole it is a beautiful place and very peaceful we had a fantastic day
Blue Hole,"We enjoyed this so much more than Dunn River Falls. Niko and his gang did an amazing job. They are very attentive and do a great job making sure everyone is safe. This is a work out. Expect swimming climbing and you have to at least jump off of two smaller banks. If you choose to you can also jump off of two waterfalls and a large platform. I jumped off of the first and I was shaking with fear. They do a great job of talking to you and trying to calm your nerves. You need water shoes you can swim in, also if you bring a camera or phone make sure you it is waterproof and you can swim with it. The water is the bluest water I have ever seen! They also have a rope swing at the end. They give you time to take pictures and they also take pictures while you are there. This was our favorite excursion. It exceeded our expectations. Also try and go on a day when the cruise ships aren't in port, they said it is very busy on those days."
A unique experience,A unique experience not too far from the very popular Dunns River Falls. So if you are going to Dunns River you should take the time to visit this place also. This would be a paradise if you know swimming. Although I didn't know swimming the guides there are very helpful and you can experience the jumping into water. If you are a swimmer this would be a paradise with some good vertical jumps into some amazing water.
Exceeded my expectations,"Coming into blue hole, I was expecting 1 little swimming area with a small cliff to jump off of, little did I know there were several areas to swim, jump, climb & swing from. This place exceeded my expectations. It’s beautiful, the staff is beyond friendly & always there to guide you & help you be cautious. Definitely a go-to place while in Jamaica! Tyrone & Daniel made the adventure one I will never forget!"
Trip of a lifetime,"There are no words to explain this amazing adventure. Tyrone was an incredible guide. Professional and Informative, Fun and helpful. He assisted us 100% of the way. Daniel took INCREDIBLE pictures. We ALWAYS felt safe and he made it memorable for all of us. From my father who at 77 walked down the waterfall to my 20yr old loving the jumps.This is a must do again and again. It will be engraved in our minds and hearts forever. Thank you. You EXCEEDED our expectations."
Blue Hole is absolutely worth the time and effort,"Blue Hole is one of those hard to describe experiences.  We went there as part of a bigger multi-event tour with the Chukka White River team.  We had been zip-lining, tubing and ATVing before going to Blue Hole, but the wait was worth it.  Wish we had the opportunity to stay longer, but when you come with a bus load of 24 people, they have to keep things moving.  Water shoes or old tennis shoes are a must at this place because you will be climbing over rocks, walking up the waterfalls to your first jumping place and doing a fair amount of walking up or down somewhere throughout your visit.  The water is beautiful and a little chilly compared to the oceans and pools around, but you are in the mountains near the source, so not surprising.  The staff is well trained, and will guide you through he process.  You start with the first ""baby jump"" and work you way up to bigger and bigger jumps into deeper and deeper water until you get to the 25 ft jump into the biggest pool at the bottom of the highest falls.  Loads of fun and some people were able to make several jumps, but the lines can get long.  When you leave the big jump area, you walk down stream to a rope swing which is fun too and then we were whisked up the stairs and back towards our bus because the had a schedule to keep.  This place is well worth the visit and would make a great single event."
Jamaica's Newest and Bluest Adventure,"The Blue Hole is a must see/do experience in Ocho Rios Jamaica! By far a better thrill seeking experience than Dunn's River Falls.  Its a beautiful space in the Jamaican hill territory with gorgeous waterfalls, enormous climbing rocks and winding paths through jungle like land.  Bring your water shoes so you won't need to buy from locals.  Tell your guide you don't want to be rushed through.  Try to time your visit when cruise ships aren't in port-it gets very busy!  Don't worry about hauling your camera, your guide will take pics and sell them to you later.  Don't be afraid to negotiate a lower rate for those pics! The ride up the mountain is very curvy and takes you by native country like areas.  Lots to see!"
FUN FUN FUN,Excellent experience ! We had 2 children with us and our guides (Gavii and his friend ) were so careful and helpful with the children and gave us so nice and fun experience.I could though suggest the admins of the blue hole to pick up the empty bottles and clean little better the surrounding when walking this beautiful paths to top.Best is to be in water-flip-flops and a waterproof mobile cover! Go and have fun!
Family trip,Troy and Julian were excellent guides! Totally worth the money! I would recommend this jewel to everyone!
Secluded Treasure,Coolest ride up the mountain.  We met our guide Nick and he took on a journey of a lifetime.  Would have never expected the thrill and journey. Water was moving rapidly due to excess water but was an amazing adventure.  Nick was cool and laid back not rushing us thru the activities.  Assisted us taking pictures of a our group we will remember forever.
Such a fun experience for all ages!,"Three generations of my family loved this place! Even my mother, who has some mobility issues, got in on some of the action. But I will warn you that this is not ""free time at the blue hole."" You get a guide and he will take you from jump to jump until you've done all six(ish?) jumps. You don't get to do them multiple times. But it's still a WONDERFUL experience and the water and scenery is beautiful! We booked our cruise excursion through Patrice Bailey (patricebailey.com) and it was perfect. The driver was waiting for us with a sign at the cruise port (even though we were VERY late because our cruise ship lost power as we were trying to exit) and gave us lots of information in between excursions. We also went tubing, which was SO much fun! I highly recommended these two excursions together with the help of Patrice Bailey."
Awesome time at Blue Hole!,"Odain, our guide at Blue Hole, was wonderful! The sights there are so amazing: the waterfall, the foliage, and the blue water! Thanks, Thomas & Richard ""The Texans"""
Good fun with the family.,Beware the photographers -  they will follow you and snap away - I paid for all the photos taken but only received half on the disk.
Highlight of my time in Jamaica ,"I was so impressed by the beauty, the care and kindness of our guide (Lloyd), the variety, the scenery, and of course the gorgeous mineral water. It was even better than I anticipated. The falls, the pools, the streams were lovely, refreshing, and fun. Our guide (and in fact all the guides that I saw) took such care to make sure every visitor enjoyed the place and was safe.  It was a spectacular stop on our trip"
Not to be missed the Blue Hole,"If you are going to Ocho Rios you must go and visit the Blue Hole, great few hours away from the hotel and get to see the really beauty of Jamaica."
Hidden gem!,"This off the beaten path natural beauty is a MUST DO if your in the Ocho Rios area!  Our guide Little T was exceptional and provided a great experience.  From the stunning natural beauty of the cliffs, waterfalls, jungle, and lagoons to the amazing cliff jumps (purely optional) this was enjoyed by swimmers and those who just wanted to sit back and take in the beauty.  High marks all around!"
👍🏼,Would highly recommend this excursion!! The scenery was so beautiful; I’ve never seen water so blue before. Jumping into the water was a blast and the tour guides were very helpful and kind and really made the experience incredible!
Fun!,Very fun expereience and beautiful to see.  The guides were very helpful and kind.  Would reccomend to any one considering going.
Lit!!!!,I had too much fun at the blue hole! a great site to see and jumping from the cliffs into the water adds the perfect amount of thrill to the tour!
A bit disappointed experience,"After we bought our tickets we got a guide for the tour. He was friendly and funny for first. Unfortunately the forest and water was full of with trash, not so much clean parts. So beautiful place but so many pet bottles and every kind of trash around. A piece of barbed wire hurted my friend, there was no chance to do any disinfection. During the tour it seemed that we have to hurry up. At the end our guide wanted tips from everyone and if it was less than 5 USD he became rude and jerk. If I know all of these before I’m sure we choose another program."
So beautiful,"It was a such a beautiful site to see. Really enjoyed the staff. So helpful and attentive. Upon arrival, each staff member greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Roads to the site needs improvement, but other than that....very impressed."
Way Better Than Dunn's,"Amazing. Ricardo, our guide, was great! Gave him 40 bucks tip. 15 dollars to get in. Beware about the ""fake"" blue hole 2 minutes prior to the real thing. Guys on motorcycles and guys jumping out in middle of street will try to get you to stop at the fake one. We spent about 2.5 hours there. My wife is very hesitant but she jumped in most of the jumps. They have someone who trails you to take pix. At end they will try to sell you one for 20 or the package for 70. Give them 50 for the entire CD (about 40 pix). If you choose Dunn;s over this place you will regret it!"
awesome,we stayed at the riu hotel in ocho rios. its a great hotel. we choose blue hole instead of dunns river for our excursion & it was awesome. also our driver is from ocho rios so he took us to other place's. if like you can reach him on whatsapp or call 1876-851-9985
Gorgeous!,You will need water shoes.  We chose Blue Hole instead of Dunn's River.  We do not regret it at all!  The water was incredible!  Our tour guide was a lot fun as well!  Very cool place.
Super fun,My hubby chickened out and didn’t get in the water. Me and my 9 yr old jumped from the high platform. Terrifying but exhilarating. The guides were great. The only downside was we didn’t bring our camera and the guy taking pics didn’t get us jumping.
Fabulous,"Loved this spot with all the pools and rocks that we could jump off. Our guides were brilliant and so strong, pulling us up the rocks, taking great photos.  It was lovely and cool in the trees and the water was pleasantly warm. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Best Tour Guide...""Demo""","Loved this part of our cruise.  Probably our favorite stop if I must be honest.  Started our trip in Falmouth and hired a driver through Quest, which is at the port.  Errol was our driver and he was amazing.  I highly recommend asking for him as your driver.  It cost us $180, round trip, and we left our property with him while we were at the Blue Hole.  Nothing was missing.  When we arrived at the actual location, we met ""Demo"".  He was so professional and still a lot of fun.  If it wasn't for his patience and encouragement I don't think Eric and I would have jumped from the big waterfall.  It was a lovely break from the saltwater, cool and refreshing.  Make sure that you do not get distracted by the roadside hagglers, they try to make you go to their ""Blue Hole"" but it is not the true location.  When you get there, you will drive through a locked chain link fence.  The fee was $15 per person on the weekday.  I am so glad we took this trip.  We will be back!"
Day out,"An excellent place to experience love it, loved our tour guide Brandon thanks for a well spend afternoon. A must visit again."
An experience not to miss,After having climbed the Dunn's River Fall we couldn't miss a trip to the Blue Hole.It's much less crowded and known so we enjoyed the more the uncontaminated nature and the sheer beauty of the river and falls.The attraction revolves around the several dives which progressively increase in height and become scarier and scarier.Overall lots of fun for the whole family and lots of dives in these wonderful falls and river.The guides are also extremely knowledgeable and will make you feel totally safe and secure at all times.Please also consider the option of a private taxi as opposed to the fully organised tours as the entrance fee to the attraction is only $20 per person.We highly recommend it to anyone who happens to spend some time in or near Ocho Rios.
Gorgeous!,"This is one of the most beautiful places I have seen on my 5 trips to Jamaica!  Our guide, Chevron(spelling?)  was so much fun and so talented!  Everyone there was friendly.  We had a marvelous time there!"
Must do!,"This was our first time doing this event.  To have the most fun, get a great tour guide.  Ours was Shevon AKA Dragon.  Very good guy.  Will definitely go again on next trip.  This is definitely next level adventure compared to Dunn's River.  Beautiful blue water so cold and refreshing.  Went under waterfalls and into the cave.  Used the clay to exfoliate.  Thanks Shevon!"
Best hidden gem!,Cost is $15 to get in. You get a guide and we highly recommend Courtney. Beautiful spring water and a great trip to spend a few hours at!
Fun time. Something new and different,Pretty amazing experience. If you have never walked across or waterfall or done multiple jumps into water leading down to a waterfall this is your chance to do an incredible experience you have never done before.
Blue Hole,Would highly recommend going here. It was one of our favorite excursion. Would go again. My son loved all the jumps.
One of the best experiences in Ocho Rios!,Going to the Blue Hole was one of the best experiences my family had in Ocho Rios.  We went on a Sunday when it was mostly locals  and not crowded.  The water was the perfect temperature and the jumps were super fun.  Our guide was patient with those of of us not sure of jumping 30 feet into the water.
Loved the Blue Hole and our Guide but...,"The pictures of this place do this place no justice. It’s absolutely beautiful! Just when you think you’ve seen it all, there’s another pool or waterfall. So many places to jump from and our guide (I didn’t get his name but I told him he looked like Snoop Dog) was so friendly and helpful in getting us from place to place. He and this particular excursion gets 5 stars.  My only regret is letting one of the tour guides talk us into purchasing pictures that he took for $60.00.  We paid and were promised they would be sent via what’s app and email but he did neither. So disappointing! He did give us a CD with the pics but I’ve yet to confirm if that too, is blank. Take your own phone for pics and just purchase a water proof case. DO NOT BE A FOOL LIKE ME AND PAY $60 for nothing! It’s unfortunate that one person can ruin an experience like that, if I could rate him, he wouldn’t get any stars however I don’t feel it’s fair to base my experience solely over this bad apple, hence the 3 stars."
Great Fun,"Had a great time at the Blue Hole. RYAN our guide was great fun and kept us laughing. There is a photographer at the Blue Hole who will take pictures and you get the option to view and buy them. I did buy them and had them on a cd disc, great memories.I would definitely recommend the Blue Hole for a couple of hours of fun.Thanks RYAN!!"
Amazing unforgettable experience,"My husband and I drove ourself there, paid the entrance fee & tipped the guide. The water is cold, beautiful and when the sun shines it is an unbelievable blue. We arrived right when they opened and had the place to ourselves. We had limited time as we were heading to the airport after. Tyler was there to guide us thru the areas and he was absolutely amazing. He told us exactly where to step, where to jump and even where to swim safely out of the waters all while taking amazing pictures/videos with our phone and holding his handsome sidekick Tyler jr. He made sure we enjoy ourselves and conquered our jumping fears. We jumped from different levels and even had time to take a swim with our humble guide and cute son. Thank you Tyler! We’ve been back home for 2 weeks and I can’t stop looking at my pics and dreaming of going back."
Amazing experience,We had an amazing time. I am afraid of heights and not a risk taker but Jamar and Nicholas helped we conquer my fears and were by my side the whole time capturing such great memories. Dont bring anything u dont want to get wet and be ready to hike through the woods. Dont forget your water shoes!! You gotta try it!
Blue Hole! You MUST get MIKE to be your guide!,"Ok, my husband and I went on a tour to Blue Hole. We took a private driver into Ocho Rios instead of going on a bus with a large group- GREAT DECISION! Mike met us at the entrance and off we went!! There are different levels of jumps.. Mike started us off at smaller jumps and we worked or way up...Oh, btw it is GORGEOUS. Mike helped us climb the rocks and told us where to step offering his hand when needed. He made sure we had plenty of photo opportunities and was so kind and took his time with us! What a BLAST! Do not skip this excursion like we almost did. It turned out to be our favorite! Ask for Mike! ****Pics when I get home and download from the DVD"
FANTASTIC REPEAT EXCURSION!!!,"My party of three was in Ocho Rios in late May 2019 and repeated the Blue Hole/River Tubing excursion with Mark's Tours.  This was my boyfriend's 1st time doing this excursion and he thoroughly enjoyed it - he says the best on the entire cruise!  The Blue Hole was as beautiful as ever and the water was refreshing; scenery along the river was relaxing and lush; but the most favorite part for my boyfriend was the history and current events narrative that Mark provided.  At the end of the excursion, Mark took us to a local watering hole to partake in some jerk chicken and pork and they were delicious!  Mark's Tours offers a number of activities; I highly recommend them for your excursions needs."
Must do!,"Excellent day tour! If you are near Ocho Rios, Blue Hole tour is a must do! There were 20 people in our group with age range 1-50ish and we all had a blast. This was definitely the highlight of our trip in Jamaica!!"
Best time ever!!!,"My husband and I went on a tour and were only given an hour to have fun, which is plenty of time. However, we fell in love with the Blue Hole. On our next trip, we'll make sure to plan accordingly and either drive ourselves or have a taxi drop us off and pick us up later. This place is simply breathtaking. The guides are the best (thank you Robert for holding my hand all the way up). The best moment for me was jumping off the ledge into the water. I wasn't going to do it but Robert convinced me to jump when he told me that the water is deep where I was jumping. The guides also take plenty of pictures and videos with your camera, so make sure to take a waterproof camera with you."
OK but rather commercialized,"Spent the morning with a group of friends traversing the falls and jumping into the water.  The area is scenic, the water invigorating.  The downside is the large number of people doing the same thing.  Everyone is having fun but it is a bit assembly line."
Javiar excellent guide,"There were 4 of us in a group and Javiar made the whole adventure amazing.  He helped us along the way and encourged us.  He provided information about the falls, and life in Jamaica."
360 around Jamaica ,The path to blue hole is a very unique road. Beautiful landscapes. Once you get there. There are 3 options. Please listen to google maps go to the very top park your car. Pay to enter blue hole. Go with a guide expect to give a tip. Eat some yummy jerk pork right outside the gate. We went with a guide she knew the landscape which made it fun. Several area to jump off we jump off at every ledge and cliff she suggested. Next time I won’t need a guide instead my GoPro
Cool swim with great guide Javier,Booked an excursion to the Blue Hole via Peat Taylor Tours. Peat hooked us up with the most energetic and engaging guide named Javier. He made sure that our experience was perfect. Blue hole is a must see and not as busy as Dunn’s Falls. Ask for Javier.
So much fun!!,"When we arrived our driver Byron, recommended The Blue Hole as a must! When we arrived we were a little late but we were allowed to go on in by the gracious lady that I assume was the manager or supervisor. Daniel was our guide and he was absolutely amazing! He was very patient with our group of nervous ladies. He was very encouraging, he took pictures for us the entire time. We all had the best time and will definitely return in the future!"
Blue Hole,Family of four visited the Blue Hole in late May.  It was not crowded at all.  Glen was an amazing guide and made sure everyone was having fun and most of all safe while walking up the falls and jumping down the falls.  It was one of the highlights of our week long stay.
Totally worth it!,We had an AMAZING time here! It was the perfect amount of adventure we were looking for. The staff members are great and want you to have fun but also feel safe!! Shout out to Andre and Mario!!
Blue Hole - DEF. DO. IT!,"This is our 6th time in Ochoa Rios. We’ve heard of the Blue Hole and were told it was a must but didn’t decide to go until our friends went earlier in the week. They weren’t wrong. I recommend taking a private taxi tour. My friends and I used Wynter/Keith (see attached business card pic) for this and other adventures. Wynter explained that there are other locations claiming to be the blue hole but this was the “real” one. On this trip, he was also kind enough to take us to river rafting, another fun excursion, and some shops. It’s a $15 per person entry fee. You need a towel and water shoes, which you can bring, buy at your hotel or get at the site. Your guide will carry your phone and take pictures for you and of you. You’ll leave the towel in the vehicle. You only wear your bathing suit. I wore a shirt over my bathing suit top and that was a bit tough to manage. You’ll lose most other things in the current or while jumping. We had Julian as our guide. He was amazing, patient and quite the photog. I wish I had him for all my travels at home and abroad. He took over 200 awesome photos! You can jump or not. No pressure for either. There are also various levels of jumping. Of note, this water is different than going into most lakes or the sea. It’s heavy and “pushes” you down. Not to fret, you can still jump but just be aware that’ll happen. You have to swim/paddle harder to get to the surface. All in all, a wonderful time and definitely worth the drive time and entry fee. You’ll probably never experience anything like it elsewhere."
Montego Bay 2019,Tour Guides up to the waterfall were extremely helpful and so friendly. Water was refreshing and not very crowded at all.
Amazing Views and Refreshing Splash !,"This experience was amazing!!!!! We did it through the Chukka tour company and we booked through our resort. The bus picked us up at 8:30 am and it was roughly an hr ride up into the rainforest. Once we arrived we signed two waivers, them walked over to the falls. It is breathtaking. You cross the water, sit and take photos, then start jumping into pools of water. The heights vary and you don’t have to do the ones you aren’t comfortable with. The rocks are slippery but you have multiple guides to assist and tell you wear to step to be safe. I did some ten foot jumps, maybe a fifteen, but my husband did a forty foot jump! I would definitely recommend this excursion for the views. One con: once you jump your group moves on. You can jump again but there is no lingering in the water at any time. I wanted to swim and enjoy myself in the Blue Hole for awhile! Brandon and Riley were excellent guides and Id definitely recommend them!"
Blue Hole ,This was a fantastic excursion. I am petrified of deep water as I am a poor swimmer but our guide Riley was fantastic and helped me the whole way. My 14 year old son who is fearless had a blast!!!
Beautiful and fun,"The scenery is beautiful and the water refreshing. There were many opportunities to jump from several natural platforms, but you are never pressured to jump if you’re not comfortable with the height. You are offered life jackets if you have limited swimming abilities.  The staff was very helpful and conscientious."
Very cool experience,This was a very cool and unique experience.So glad we went. Scenery was incredible.The guides were amazing !!! They way the move around the falls ..... WOW !!!! Great time !
a must see,what a great experience jumping off the cliffshad an amazing time thereour guides were all great and friendlydon't miss it
The most beautiful waterfall in Jamaica,"I had an awesome time here. It was quite the thrill. Beautiful natural pools, clear blue water. Just wow. Very scenic."
Fun,The guides were awesome and gave us a very fun experience!! Jumping off the cliffs was scary but very fun. My wife and I had a blast!!
Face your fears and jump!,"""Face your fears and jump"" is what we were told while standing atop the highest cliff at the Blue hole looking down at the turquoise water below.  We did it and it was an adrenaline rush!  There are guides and several sizes of cliffs to jump from, ranging from you small to very high.  Definitely a must try experience when visiting Ocho Rios."
Jamaica's jewel (Blue Hole),"Another hidden jewel. We had an amazing tour guide, Fabian. He was so patient with our group of 9. He was very knowledgeable about the beautiful falls. He spent over 3 hours with us, allowing us ample time at each location. I jumped off cliffs into beautiful blue waters."
Don't miss this!,"We booked a tour here through AA Cruises for our day in Ocho Rios on the NCL Epic and it was our family's favorite tour of our vacation. Sam, our tour guide, was engaging and helpful. Our 2 teenage sons loved it so much they would have hung out here all day. Even I did all but the last jump and I am not much of a thrill seeker...Oh, and did I mention how absolutely beautiful it is?One note - we had to leave everything in our shuttle - clothes, backpacks etc. All you can really bring with you is your phone if it's in a waterproof case around your neck - which you definitely want because you will get amazing pictures!"
MUST DO!!,"Went on this excursion while staying in Runaway Bay. We didn't get the full experience because the current was too strong that day. We were told there were 2 more jumps (higher) they couldn't take us too which was a bummer. Other than that, our 2 guides were great & friendly. If and when I go back to Jamaica, I would like to do this again."
Gorgeous place! ,Came here and was mesmerized by the beauty and tranquility of this place. Jayson was our tour guide and was súper hospitable and made sure we were all comfortable and guided us through this majestic blue hole! I made sure to jump off every jump; we even got to go to a part of the underwater cave!! Must do this if you come to Jamaica! It’s not at touristy as Dunn’s River Falls but equally beautiful!
Amazing Jamaica Excursion!! You gotta do it!!,Beautiful scenery.  The water was sooo refreshing.  We came with a group of 24 of us ranging from 11 to 50+ and Richard and Daniel did an amazing job of guiding us up the waterfalls.  We had the opportunity to dive into the pools from various different heights and they even led us into the middle of a waterfall we could leap from (while one person blocked the water).  So glad we did this!!
Blue hole beauty,Ordane our tour guide was amazing. Took his time with people from it group and showed us an awesome time. Bonus points for not losing my phone while we did the good diving
The best staff hands down ,They were patient with All sizes and ages of customers ( we are both over 60) very encouraging and helpful our guide Jay took my phone and took lots of great pictures the entire time!
Amazing tour,Absolutely wonderful tour of a natural wonder. Such a beautiful place. Our guide took us all the way up and shared his passion for the place with us.
Must see!,"We didn't book this excursion through any company, went on our own with the intention of doing it on our own. Upon arrival at a road some distance away from the entrance, there are a bunch of guides hanging around that insisted that you need a guide so one of them led us to the entrance through a long winding road. The only washroom is near the entrance where you pay the entrance fee, there are 2 but only one of them has water to wash your hands. Walk a bit further down and there is a shack for changing as well as lockers and life jackets for rent. We didn't use the locker. There is some benefits to having a guide. Our guide did not rush us at all and is constantly on the lookout for our safety (we're a group of 10 adults + 1 kid). He also took pictures and videos for us during our jumps and group pictures which is really nice.  There is a bit of a hike to get to the jumps which can be done by anyone, even those who can't swim-me (you just need to know how to hold your breath until you get above water :D) Overall, definitely recommend for anyone who want a bit of adventure and conquer the fear of height.Water shoe is a must, towel, water bottle and a change of clothes are needed if you want to be dry before leaving."
Simply beautiful,"Just as gorgeous as it was on our last trip. Guides are awesome, very helpful and willing to take pictures of us and with us. The area is beautiful and the water is so super clear! Loved it! Totally recommend going!"
Inappropriate And pushy,"Rude from the very beginning, pushy. One of the instructors hit on my wife. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone"
Amazing!,"I highly recommend this excursion. I travel all over and this by far has been one of my top 3! Our guide was Andre and he made this adventure an absolute blast! I typically do not visit the same island twice, yet do the same excursion twice, but I will be coming back to Jamaica and I definitely will be back to the Blue Hole!!!!"
Beautiful,This place was just as beautiful as the pictures. I loved it. I can not wait to return. There were several places to jump and swing into the beautiful blue water. I liked that there wasn’t as many people here as Dunn’s River but this definitely beat Dunn’s River if you ask me.
Blue Hole was beautiful and fun,"Our guide ""Little T"" at Island Gully Falls (Blue Hole) was awesome. He made sure I didn't fall or slip before I was supposed to.  He was also very knowledgeable with our Go Pro camera so we got some awesome pics and video  We are in our 50's and were a little hesitant to do the jumps but with a little coaxing from Little T who jumped first and was waiting below, my husband and I both did multiple jumps.  It was fun and now we can say we did it.  If you have mobility issues this is NOT for you as there are quite a few steps or uneven surfaces covered in water you would be walking through. For us it was a great excursion."
Beautiful natural pools!,Natural pools with clear blue water and water falls. This is a beautiful place. Most of the pools are deep but they provide a lifesaver if you cannot swim. There are lots of steps and waking over rocks but the guides help a lot! This place needs to be in the to do list when visiting Ocho Rios. We went May 2017 but forgot to write the review back then.
Put this on your don't miss list,We did this as a group along with Dunn's River Fall.  Liked the falls and Loved the Blue Hole. Make time for this destination.
Beautiful place!,"This was an incredible adventure, really forces you to unplug and just admire the beauty of the falls. Water was freezing cold until I got used to it, it is a difficult climb even in watershoes especially if you are not used to climbing slippery surfaces. There are 3 different height jumps and a rope swing you can do. I did the tallest jump and the smaller jump but did not do the rope swing or the 2nd highest jump. Even if you cannot swim or are physically unable to make the climb, you can still enjoy the Falls at the bottom and life jackets are provided if needed."
Amazing Experiance,"Natural waters with water falls where a amazing sight. The tour guide was really helpful, he knew what he was doing and made sure we where safe. We also went into the mud cave and scrubbed our self with the mud which we where told is good for our skin. I did not jump off cliff however as i was scared."
"Natural Wonder of the Blue Hole, Ocho Rios","On a day trip from Montego Bay, bypassed Dunn’s Falls for the less congested Blue Hole. Such an incredibly beautiful spot. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about local plants and wildlife, and was very entertaining and helpful. If you want the full experience, you need to swim and climb a little, and, with a little courage, jump in on the way back down. The whole tour took about an hour and at no time did we feel rushed or unsafe. Life jackets are available for those who aren’t proficient swimmers, and the guides will tailor your experience to your comfort level. Overall, kind of a magical experience."
Simply Amazing!!!,What an experience!!! Cliff jumping into waterfalls in a rain forest with a guided tour. A truly memorable experience for our family. If you are in Jamaica you have to experience the natural beauty of Blue Hole!
"Whatever you do, DO NOT miss this","While there are other ""falls"" attractions to choose, this former ""locals only"" spot is not a must see. The waterfalls are gorgeous, but there is so much more to do. There are four great spots to cliff jump as well as a rope jump. Also, the water is a natural spring and after the hot walk it is quite refreshing. Finally, the tour guides that take you around are great fun. Ours took all our pictures, over 100, and even took several videos of my jumps. While I'm less than graceful, I'm so glad to have them. The whole experience is amazing. ""Ya-mon""!"
Best waters of my love,Loved visiting the crystal clear waters and jumping off rocks into the amazing cool crisp water.  Our tour guide kinsbert with Chukka and king tours was a great help.
Beautiful and fun!,Only spent 45 mins here but had a great time. The guides make sure you feel comfortable and enjoy the area.
A Little Piece Of Heaven!,"This place was recommended by a friend that lives in Kingston, Jamaica so we knew it was worth checking out. Unlike most people there we came in a rental car. We were greeted (chased down on a bicycle lol) by our tour guide. I was hesitant to even hire a guide assuming we can just walk the entire area on our own but they are in fact mandatory as they know their way around,assist with getting out of the water and become your personal photographer. Bring water shoes, a towel, bathing suit, money for the entrance fee, locker and money to tip your guide at the end. If you're going to take pictures (and TRUST ME you'll want to take pictures!) ensure your phone has a water proof case on it. This place is truly magical. I don't even have the words to describe it. The water is a stunning blue colour, the forest is full of various beautiful flowers and plants, and there are numerous cliffs and swings you can jump off of. Also, plenty of stunning waterfalls. Our guide (unfortunately I don't recall his name) was friendly, took endless pictures and videos, showed us the local elementary school, educated us on the plants and flowers we were passing and best of all didn't rush us at all! We were there for 3 hours! I honestly didn't want to leave. We went in the late afternoon on a Tuesday. There were barely any tourists there. Felt like we had the entire jungle to ourselves. It was absolutely magical. I would recommend this place even to people that don't know how to swim/aren't comfortable in water. It's worth it just for the scenery alone. But from what I saw, life jackets were available (likely at an additional cost) so everyone can participate in the Tarzan swing and cliff jumping. GO! You won't regret it!"
DEVON the lifeguard and guide is the best in konoko falls,we had a great expirience at the konoko falls and devon the guide took us very safely and paitently thrue the fallsthanks very much
A little slice of paradise!,"Definitely visit Blue Hole Excursions, the one at the top of the hill! As my group had been to Jamaica many times and had resigned ourselves to not leaving our beautiful beach, we were convinced by Mr. Pugh of TranTours, that it was worth it, and it was. Not only was it a little bit of paradise, but our guide, Ricardo, or Pretty Ricky, as we affectionately called him, took great care of these women of a certain age, me with a broken wrist. Go early and have the park almost to yourself.  You'll be glad you did!"
Unbelievale Experience!,"We hired a local Jamaican to take us to Blue Hole and man am I glad we did! This hidden gem is in the middle of nowhere, way off the beaten path. FYI, if you are not part of a large group excursion outing, DO NOT listen to the guys along the road as you are approaching the site, telling you turn off. Keep driving until you can't go any further...that's the only Registered location to enlist an actual guide. The blue hole ""pool"" and the winding water falls up the mountain are amazingly beautiful and so fun. Lots of climbing, rope swinging, jumping, etc. Perhaps a once in a lifetime type experience and well worth a half day of your vacation. I highly recommend it!"
Highly Recommend,"This was an amazing swimming and diving spot. The water was a brilliant blue and our guides Temoy and Mike were the absolute best. They were experienced, patient and made sure everyone in our group had the VERY BEST time. We can not thank our tour operator Devon from Maxi Tours in Montego Bay enough for taking us to experience this hidden gem. We would highly recommend this spot."
Blue Hole!,"We just returned home to Canada from the most amazing vacation in Jamaica, and needed to take the time to praise this place. We set out for adventure with our driver Devon Sterling from Montego Bay, and highly recommend visiting here. The staff and guides Timoy and Mike were exceptional on every level, and did not dissapoint when encouraging us to take part in every part of this amazing experience. It truly is breathtaking, fun, and the clear mineral water was unlike any other place we had been. We are beyond grateful for every experience we had, but this was certainly a highlight. Thank you from all of us on the East Coast of Canada, as we certainly will be back next year! Irie!❤❤❤"
Gorgeous and Thrilling,"We had planned to go to Dunn's River Falls, but our driver suggested we go here instead. So glad! I checked the cruise schedule so we went on a day when no ships were in town, so it wasn't crowded in the least. Our guide was fun and helpful. One in our party was pretty scared of heights, and I do wish the guides hadn't been so eager to taunt him into jumping (none of us thought he was being less than manly!). But we all had a great time. BTW: buy the photo CD! You can't bring anything with you, and you will be grateful for the pictures later!"
Exciting and fun!  (even with little ones),"Breathtaking hidden place in the jungle! We were between Dunns River and Blue Hole and our airport driver recommended Blue Hole without a doubt.. so glad we listened to him! We went with our 6yr old, 9yr old and even our infant! They had a life jacket for the kids. We all had a blast jumping from different cliffs and rope swings. The path from one area to the next was mostly easy to walk up/down makeshift steps and railings (we did this holding baby just fine), however we are fit and healthy (this may be an issue if you have bad knees, etc) There was even a waterfall you swim behind to a ""secret"" cave- a big hit with my boys!). Everyone was very nice and friendly. You get to see a less touristy side to Jamaica. Never felt unsafe in any way- from the drive, people or unsafe jumping areas. For a $15 entry fee, you get a personal ""lifeguard""/guide to show you exactly where to jump, walk, etc. Our guide was Marvin- he was awesome! Stayed with us the entire time and was very helpful. We got there at 10am on a non-cruise ship day and were the ONLY people there. Felt like we had our own private water hole. Very worth the trip.  Be sure to wear water shoes!  (not flip flops, etc)"
Exhilarating and calming all in one!!!,"We did the blue hole and river tubing and it was so much fun.  For the blue hole portion... that was beautiful.  Just amazing to see these waterfalls. You climb the rocks then you can jump into the water below.  Can be a little intimidating but you do wear life vests.  It was really cool. And there were areas that you could choose not to jump from...but generally the smaller jumps everyone did.  Water was beautiful but a bit chilly... although exhilarating.  Definitely glad we did this. Next was the tubing.  Our guide, Allen, was hilarious!  This was just a lazy ride down the river...a little bit more adventurous than your typical lazy river at a rec center but nothing scary... just fun."
BEST excursion ever! Just wish we had more time there!,"If you only do one thing, do the Blue Hole. As long as you don't mind jumping into water. You don't have to but that's the thrill of this place. You keep getting higher and if I can do it, ANYBODY can. Even a little girl did as scared as she was the first jump. (Last 2  high jumps she went with tour guide)."
Sunday's Blues!,"What a glorious place to recuperate after a night of partying!  We drove from the White River to the Blue Hole - short hop.  Our guide, Odean, was well-informed, courteous and amusing!  Amazing and spectacular falls, glorious lush vegetation, friendly vendors.  My companion and I agreed that the icing on the cake was to have our feet washed by a friendly local, before putting on our shoes! We offered to pay, he refused! How refreshing.  I rather Blue Hole to any other well known falls, as it is less commercialised.  Another one of St Mary's lesser known treasures!"
Great time ask for Odean (O d ann),"This place was great, Private tour with Marvyn paradise tours and our driver Gregory was the best. He recommended Odean to us and he did not disappoint. Jumping, swimming, swinging, & climbing Odean was there the whole time directing us, keeping us safe, and overall making sure we had a great time at the blue hole. A+ experience."
Simply Natural!,"This maybe on of Jamaica's most popular attraction at this time. Not yet fully commercialised and nestled in the hills of St. Mary, this spot is most frequented by persons looking to have a real vibe without the ""touristy"" vibe."
Best day ,"We went with a group of 20. Ages 11-75. The guides were great. They assisted Fred 75, all the up to the falls. They were very friendly and helpful to all. It was amazing there. All ages enjoyed jumping off different cliffs. It's a must in Jamaica"
Trip,"At first we were sceptic about this as we were hiking not 100% sure where we are going, once we got to the falls / jump we all had a awesome time swimming climbing jumpingThis is a must !"
Best excursion in Jamaica!!!,Absolutely the best excursion and guides!!! Shavonn and Ramone were our guides and they were so kind and genuine. The blue hole was the highlight of our trip. I totally understand why they say skip Dunn’s river and do the Blue hole!! We did both and we should have skipped Dunn’s river and the crowd! The Blue hole is a MUST if you are in Jamaica!! We had so much fun! Our group ranged in age from 14-50 years old and everyone had a blast. Thank you again Shavonn and Ramone for an amazing experience and some really great go pro footage! We also purchased the pictures and we are extremely happy with the quality(negotiate the price).
Anniversary trip,A must do while In Jamaica! Out guide (I can’t remember his name) was amazing! He was very attentive and made us all feel at ease climbing up to the top to start the tour and jumps. He was even an amazing cameraman as he took most of my pics with my phone as my husband and I did the jumps. We will definitely visit the next time we are in Ocho Rios! Oh and let’s not forget our gracious driver Leroy! Those mountain roads are no joke and Leroy didn’t flinch a bit! Thank you for getting us up and down that mountain. My nerves were so bad!!
Blue Hole,"We had an amazing time, if you have the opportunity ask for Odean, he's a great guide that will you show you around and keep you highly entertained."
 Exhilarating! ,"This is one of the best trips I have been on in Jamaica. If you like the excitement of jumping off different heights into water you’re bound to find something that challenges you. For the less adventurous, the scenario is spectacular! Great staff, who help and encourage you throughout."
Made my vacation the best ever,"Our guide Riley was the best.  Besides making sure everyone jumped at their leisure, had fun, and was safe he also helped my sister when she lost her camera in the water.  He spent over 5 minutes diving for it and didn’t give up until he found it!  We had a big family group from age 5 to 66.  All had fun.  My husband who is terrified of water went and Riley helped him get across and took a great family picture of us.  If I ever go back I will make sure Riley is our guide again!"
Robbie was a fantastic guide!,"This is a must-do if you are visiting the Ocho Rios area. My boyfriend and I were treated to an amazing tour by Robbie, who held our phones and captured amazing videos and photos of us so we could jump into the beautiful blue water and truly enjoy ourselves. He made me feel safe and comfortable when I expressed my fear of heights and let me enjoy the ""chicken jump"" instead of the higher ledges. I highly recommend this experience!Our driver Orion also helped make this trip one to remember. He pointed out interesting sights and facts during our scenic drive to Blue Hole."
Awesome!,I went here with my daughter last week & it was sooooo much fun! So Beautiful & awesome! It was such an amazing day. Special thanks to Dante... he was our guide & he is the BEST EVER! He is so adorable & helpful & patient. He had my phone & took a ton of pics & videos for us the whole time. This is def one of the coolest day trips you can take. I booked through Jacques Tours Jamaica~ I highly recommend them & experiencing the Blue Hole! Thanks Dante! You made our day even better :))) We will be back.
Excellent,What a great trip the journey was approx 1 hour from Riu hotel Ocho Rios.The Blue Hole is a great experience safe rock climbing jumping and swimming in the pure cool water.The whole experience lasted one hour
This place was beautiful and such fun for the family,What a great adventure this place was. The kids really loved it here. The staff was very helpful... especially our guide Andrew.
Amazing!,"What an amazing experience!! We had two families with kids 12, 14 & 17. Everyone loved it! Our guide, Ryan (#17) was so much fun and made sure we had a great time and that we were able to navigate everything safely! So glad we decided to take this in while in Jamaica."
This place was beautiful and it was fun to jump off the cliffs.,"The place is beautiful and fun to jump off the different ledges. The only down side is since its crowded they really rush you up and down fast. the tour was really only about 30 min tops at the water fall. They gave the option of jumping down or walking but not both. we wanted to swim under as we had seen others doing but our guide said no there is no time. would have been nice to be able to enjoy it instead of being pushed along. Then they had the nerve to ask for tips. I told them that they should let the people enjoy the falls, then they probably would have to ask for tips."
Amazing last minute excursion,"This trip was suggested to our group of 9 (two families) with kids 8-13 years old the day before.  We made the trip from Montego Bay and it was the most amazing day!  Something for everyone, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, non-touristy adventure."
"Hard, very hard if not in good physical condition!","Ask our tour guide before booking if it was a hard walk.  Our group all over 50, one needing double knees, one already having two artificial knees and one with back issues that make walking very difficult and painful.  She said it was a short walk we would be ok.  Well, it was a short walk from the bus to where you pay.  But it is a long way up and hard, if it wasn't for the guide I would have never made it.  He pulled me up each step, my poor friend with the artificial knees made it but sat and rested the whole time and never participated in the water activities.  It was a nice place but I don't recommend it for anyone who has knee or leg problems.  My friend didn't want to do anything at port the next day due to the pain she was still in from the Blue Hole, my legs hurt badly also and I didn't feel I would be able to walk in port either ruined the day for us at Cayman Islands.  Never would have booked if tour guide would have been honest."
What a fantastic place,"Beautiful scenery with really refreshing water.Our guide Alex was excellent, he helped us in and out of the water and took some great pictures with our camera. We hiked up to the top then worked our way down jumping into the pools. BE CAREFUL....IT IS SLIPPERY and a bit of a workout but sooo much fun. I even surprised myself by going on the rope swing. It would've been nice to spend a little more time swimming in the pools as the water was so nice.A great experience. Highly recommended."
Not the REAL Blue Hole??,"Blue Hole was so much fun, but not what we expected. Our expectation was to see a large calm and serene swim area to lounge about with several places to jump in from. However, we booked transportation with Jacques Tours and he took us to the licensed section of the Blue Hole, which I believe is where the difference comes in.Instead we got a high energy and invigorating experience. Our driver from Jacques Tours once again took care of our tickets and facilitated a quick and easy entrance. We were paired with a guide who was absolutely amazing!! (I believe his name was Dante). He was assuring, encouraging, and very helpful to a few members in our party who were scared or not as certain to do the various jumps. Dante took us up to the top of the fall area and proceeded to guide us down, section by section, jumping from rocks at various heights. We then did a huge jump off a platform, a rope swing, and then a jump from another extremely high point. I didn't do the last one - I was too scared, but my eight-year-old did it!!"
Best day out all holiday !!,"Absolutely loved it! Amazing rope swing into the lagoon then swimming in the lagoon, then into cave for a mud mineral facial! And a cliff dive too!!! The guides were so helpful too! Especially as we had baby and young kids with us!"
Blue Hole - A Total Dump & Waste of $$$! So Disappointing & Scary! Nothing like what I saw Online!,"I just returned from a recent Caribbean cruise vacation (Holland America Line, Western Caribbean)..one of the stops, unfortunately was Ocho Rios. I say ""unfortunately"" because this was the by far the worst port I've ever been at..this only having been our very 2nd cruise..we were horrified! I've heard all about Jamaica & being a travel planner, I never had any desire to go..but it was a stop & my teen & tween wanted to do an ""adventure""..so I researched different things prior to our vacay & found the ""Blue Hole"" on social media. I didn't want to do the normal things the cruise line offered (BIG mistake!) The Blue Hole looked & sounded wonderful...such ""pretty"" Instagramy photos...NOT! First off..when you arrive there, make sure to have your own aqua shoes (they'll make you pay for dirty, used ones!) They nickel & dime you for everything along the way..I was offered weed, barraged by tons of annoying vendors! There were piles of trash & dirty water bottles in the falls & water along the way (so sad & gross!) You'd think they'd clean the place up if it was a tourist place? Once there, they had my kids jump & rushed us out after about 30 mins..if you want their gross ""jerk chicken"", that's extra $$..there was NO way, I was eating a thing there..if you go, you're risking your life..bring tons of cash & make sure to give your guides a hefty tip. We didn't have a ton of cash on us after the cab ride from the cruise port (that cost us $140!) The guides looked as tho they may kill us..take a tip & skip Jamaica all together! I don't know how so many others are giving this place a great review? Crazy? It was literally a gorgeous Falls set in the middle of a garbage filled trash heap in a 3rd world country..getting there was a horror story too (another story!) My husband & kids got a couple jumps & then the idiot guides had them go to the cliff on the opposite side (really high side) which wasn't even owned by the Blue Hole company it turned out..how stupid? My husband & daughter were told to jump & not come back as that was private property..you would think the Blue Hole guides would ""know"" that info..very  poorly run & not worth the boatload of $$ we spent...never again will we go to this rat trap of an island...If you're on a cruise boat..stay ON the boat & enjoy the amenities there..you'll be much happier!"
Beautiful blue hole. ,We all had a great time visiting the big blue hole. It was a memorable day off the busy city tours.  The water was soooo blue and refreshing to swim in. We took a hike to the next part of the park. It was beautiful forest and water to jump into. It was a quick day trip.
"Interesting walk through the jungle, and cool swimming","Bit pricey to get in, and also have to pay a guide, but the walk through the jungle was fun. Then able to swim in the cool waters."
Beautiful!,This is worth going to see! It is a short hike (not recommended to young children or people with any kind of physical problems). It was beautiful!
Blue is Fantastic!,"Recommend taking as little belongings as possible, although lockers available for rentals to keep a small set of items. Definitely take waterproof recording devices or phone. water shoes and if you want a life jacket although these are available for purchase/rental. I enjoy my visit every time, it is a bit of a long journey but worth it. Take food or lots of snacks! Go early! The lifeguards/ photographers take care of you so tip is worth it."
So much fun with Javier!,"We went when the water was very high and a very strong current but we had the best lifeguard/ guide ever!! Javier was so much fun, adventurous and constantly looking out for our safety so we could enjoy ourselves! The photos they took were great and we bought a cd on our way out! From a resort, ask for a Juta and if you get lucky, Junior will be your driver! He was great! Took us anywhere we wanted to go for the whole day! Even stopped at Dave’s, a local place with amazing lobster!"
Blue Hole in Jamaica,We had a wonderful time at the Blue Hole. Odean was a fantastic tour guide! This was a great experience! Tour isn't very long but was still great fun!
Such a fun and safe excursion!,"We went on this excursion during our honeymoon. It was amazing and fun and we made new friends! It was so beautiful, this was the highlight to our trip to Jamaica. Good price too!!!"
Adventure Awaits!,"What a fantastic visit to Blue Hole. There are beautiful waterfalls and a trail through the forest. If you are more adventurous you can walk down the waterfalls, swing off a rope into the water and jump off different platforms into the beautiful blue water. I totally recommend this for the adventure Seeker and those with teenagers or family members that like to go on tours outside of the box."
"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!",Gorgeous Refreshing water for the hot Jamaican sun!  Our guide was Dragon - what a guy!!! Awesome tour guide!!! Took great care getting me down to the water ( didn’t wanna jump ) and helping me out!  Had us laughing and smiling the whole time!   A must visit!!  Go!!!
"Beautiful, but crowded on the day we went","Beautiful locale, but there were 2 ships in port that day, so it was really crowded. There were lines at all the different jumping-off points. Make sure you have water shoes, and expect to get some minor scrapes and scratches as you climb up and then out of the water. There were many young kids doing it too."
Love it here,"We had a tour guide named David. We jumped off the cliffs, explored the cave behind the waterfall and had a blast. Beautiful place"
Definitely a must do,"Very cool experience- one of my favorites ever. We ported at Montego Bay (Carnival Dream) so the bus ride was about 2 hrs. It was well worth it. The blue hole is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. There are several places to jump into the water- they start you off small and you can skip the higher jumps if you’re a chicken. But don’t be a chicken - the jumps are amazing. Captain Morgan and Andre were our guides and they were great. They take pictures of you while you’re going through and will sell your group a package at the end - the pics were great. Bring water shoes that fit fairly tight. When you get out of your bus or car don’t bring anything you don’t want to get wet. Several people brought water tight phone cases and took pics - no phones were lost, but it’s probably easier to let them take your pics and buy them at the end. You have to do this at least once!"
"Carnival Excursion: Tubing, Ziplining, Blue Hole with Lunch","Beverly was our guide for the day & Damion was our driver.  We were with our group of 11 plus 6 other people but never felt like we were in too big of a group.  It should also be noted that we were cruising during spring break so the port was VERY busy.  Never once did we feel any location/activity was crowded and we pretty much did activities with just our group.  I would NEVER drive in Jamaica.  Terrifying! Our driver handled the sketchy drive up the mountain wish ease and expertise.  Beverly was a saint! She handled our children as if they were her own. She was always keeping an eye out for the ""babies"" and made sure we, the parents, enjoyed ourselves.  Tubing was fantastic. Our guides phenomenal (I wish I remembered their names) the water was clear and refreshing.  There was some moments with rapidish moving water but was safe for even the smallest kiddos.  We all got off the river laughing and really enjoyed the experience. We then went on to zipling.  My 9 year old absolutely refused to zipline so I said one of us would stay back with him but Beverly stepped in said No way! She would take care of my baby so I could enjoy myself.  His dad ended up staying back with him but the gesture was appreciated. A worker who was busy fitting people in harnesses even stopped what she was doing to take my son to the side and have a little talk about how she would keep him safe (it didnt work).  She didnt have to do that... the customer service is out of this world. The zipling was very exciting! You do have to hike up quite a few flights of steep stairs to get to the starting point.  Once started you zipline to (I believe it was) 4 platforms.  After ziplining we were ushered to a shaded area for jerk chicken, rice & beans, and salad.  We were afraid some of the kids wouldn't like lunch but we all enjoyed it.  They also served Rum punch and fruit punch.  The Rumpunch was enjoyed by all the adults:) We then drove via bus to the Blue Hole.  Guys... it was SO beautiful! The guide assigned to us (sooo wish I remembered names) was exceptionally kind.  He maneuvered us up to the top and safely got us jumping from each section! Even the most cowardly of the group (me..haha) gave it a go! We did have some in our group partake in Marijuana smoking. It was readily available for those concerned on finding it. For anyone concerned about the kids noticing it.. I never noticed the transaction and neither did the kids. When they smoked Beverly was happy to entertain the kids for a few minutes.  Guys, I told you... the lady was a Saint.  All & all it was an absolutely perfect day.  I do have to say though: The guides & workers we encountered are truly what made the experience. Customer service the likes I've never encountered before.  This one day made Jamaica steal my heart and I can not wait to return!"
Blue hole,"Visited here today if you have a non swimmer in your party then this is not the place for them. Our visit was about 1.5hrs and was good fun after you got over the fear of jumping off high ledges. The guys were great and helped guide you through the waters, we arrived on the day they were doing maintenance on the water pipes so the water was very high and forceful. Fun-filled and excellent if you are a good swimmer. Definitely recommend."
A good alternative to Dunn River Falls ,The Blue Hole is a natural waterfall and river waterhole that is less traveled than its more famous counterpart and equally nice. It is not as spectacular as some waterfalls in places like Costa Rica but it is a pleasant experience with good and attentive guides and a fun place to cool off in fresh water with a spot to dive or just hangout. It is not a place to spend the day but as part of an itinerary it is good for an hour or two.
Amazing place! Super busy though,One of the busiest places we went to in Jamaica. It is stunning though and worth seeing. We preferred reach falls but its quite far north
Great Experience,"The Blue Hole was a great experience! Our driver Pete got us to the hole and waited the entire time, then drove us around the city. Told us all about Jamaica too. When we got to the blue hole, we had a personal guide provided to us named Timoy, and he was very helpful. He assisted us through, held our phones and even recorded us as we jumped into the series of big blue pools. Great time, would suggest."
Piece of Heaven,Wasn't sure what to expect but boy did we love this place!  If you get a chance you should really visit. Didn't go with an organized tour - just showed up and had one of the tour guides take us through.  Was a little scared to jump but so glad I did!
Will be back ,"We love this place.  We went a couple years ago and came again with another couple.  Our guide was Romain, like the lettuce.   He was amazing.  He took some great photos of us too.  There is a place to buy pictures, drinks and jerk chicken at the end too.  I’ve been to Dunn’s River Falls too but this place is way better if you are looking for fun and adventure."
Highlight of my sons trip!,If you are a thrill seeker then this is the place for you. It’s full of cliff diving and refreshing rivers. My 12 year old had so much fun he wanted to do the excursion again the following day. 5 stars
Want to do this again right now,4 adults and one child went here and we are so glad we did- it was the highlight of our trip.  We had Tyrone as our guide and he was wonderful.  He made sure everyone navigated the trails safely.  I have three broken toes and he was fantastic with me and my young daughter.  One friend doesn't swim but still loved it.  You can jump in two spots- one 30 ft up and the other closer.  There is a cave we swam in and Tyrone took photos of us.  He is from the area and was very pleasant.  I want to have him be our guide next time as well.  The beer is a bit expensive but the experience was FANTASTIC.  We arrived via private guide to Blue Hole and there were restrooms there as well as snacks and people selling wares.  GOGOGO.  Much better than Dunns River.
White water rafting blue hole “ALLEN” “bald guy”,Allen was a wonderful best tour guy ever he was very helpful and was a lot of help!!!very helpful he was a great guide in the water didn’t pressure you to tip him got us fruit right off the tree was a great guy!!!
Absolutely great fun,"Visited with 12 year old daughter, we were on a organised trip through TUI, this really is a wonderful place it was great fun, the guides were excellent and helped you every step of the way , so much fun jumping in the water from cliff edges!!! My daughter throughly enjoyed this"
"Fun, refreshing, beautiful!","The water really IS that blue!  So amazingly beautiful!  We had a great time jumping and swinging at the Blue Hole - three children ages 8-14 and two adults.  The guide was very helpful and the photographer got some great shots, too.  Highly recommend!"
Spring Break 2019,I would highly recommend visiting The Blue Hole we all loved it.  Our guide Riley was awesome I don’t like swimming and he made me feel very comfortable.  My kids and husband said Riley was awesome.  The falls were beautiful.  Go see and ask for guide Riley he is awesome.
Very nice place,"I am a Jamaican native, actually a native of the same area where blue hole is. This was my first visit since the blue hole was established as a tourist attraction and i must say I am proud. I enjoyed every aspect of my visit. The water was nice, clean, refreshing. The staff and vendors ar2 friendly and pleasant. This place is a must visit."
Amazing,"This was by far one of the best experiences I have had. The scenery could not be captured in photo. This place was gem. The tour guides, photographers and locals were fun. Shallon was one of are guides and he was very entertaining. The rope swing and cliff jumps were fun. This is a must do if you are in the Ocho Rios area."
Beats Dunns River Falls hands down!,"We had a great time at the Blue Hole - fun times jumping from the rocks and swimming in the water.  Our guide, Javier was fantastic.  Lots of photo opportunities, and not nearly as crowded as Dunns River Falls."
Amazing experience,"This was one of the highlights of my trip. It was great to see people challenge their fears and the guides were kind and supportive. However, I wish there was more time to explore. It is a beautiful place and clean. The roads are tough is get up but nice once you get there."
A fun stop away from the full-on tourist attractions!,"This place is really fun for the adventure seeker.  Lots of jumping into the water from high perches and swinging in from rope swings as well as jumping from the middle of a waterfall!  Definitely not for poor swimmers, those with physical limitations or small children.  You are sent with a guide the whole time, which means be prepared to tip fairly generously....  This is nice for the history and for the guidance on where it is safe to jump, etc., but having them with you the entire time is a little intrusive.  It would have been better to have them help initially and then leave us to enjoy and relax on our own.  Overall really enjoyed the place and would recommend it."
So fun to jump!,"It was spring break and a cruise ship was in so it was a little crowded (by their standards). Every group had a guide and the guides kept things rolling. I didn’t feel rushed at all. I’m 53 and I decided I may never get a chance to do this again so I jumped at every chance I was given. It is a natural wonder, all these small swimming holes that are so deep that you can jump from 10 feet up. Probably one of the best adventures I have had in awhile."
The place to go when your in Jamaica,It the best place you get to enjoy your self and clam the falls and there are some great tour guides there the mud bathe it wonderful the water is so cool and nice thanks for a great tour Demar or called other wise janga
Special Attention to Children,"The guys at the Blue Hole did a great job at caring for my kids and making sure they were safe.  We enjoyed our experience there, had a blast.  I would go back!"
MUST DO!!!,This was a total must do for us !  The tour guide was delighful and everyone 'working' there is a pleasure to talk to .  If you are also doing Dunne's Falls - do Dunne's first.  They are both fun and excitigin but in different ways.  Dunne's you climb up the waterfalls - it is a…
Family trip,Love this place very beautiful. Awesome time both times my wife and I have been there . Dave was our tour guide both times nothing but respect for you Dave one love .
overrated and crowded,although this is beautiful and fun it was packed with people and it felt rushed.  It was a cruise day so if you are going to do this do this on a day the cruise ships are not docked.  
Beautiful setting for adventure!,"This place is unlike any other. Members of our group actually overcame their fear of water to jump in--it's that irresistible! The staff are great as well. Dante was our guide and he was so patient with the less-mobile elder parents in the group.We had Jacques Tours drive us up (the road is in pretty rough shape), as it was cheaper to have them drive us than it was to let Sandals push their driver services on us, and they were so great. They made sure our entry was covered and that we had everything we needed."
Rustic fun,Really good for $15.  Very rustic guide was great.  You start at the top of the falls and work your way down jumping swing etc.  It was more than expected and you could stay as long as you want. Does make you think if you hit a rock or something but Guides were great helping you along the way and you do not have to do any jumps if you do not want to.
So Much Fun!  Better than Dunn's River!,"We initially were taking an excursion to Dunn's River but last minute was recommended to head to Blue Hole instead.  We are so happy we made the change!  Being able to jump off a cliff, swing from a rope, jump from a platform, walk down a waterfall and jump into the water or just swim around at our leisure was so great!Our friends we were with went to Dunn's River a few years ago and they both agreed that this was a far better experience with the kids (ages 9-18).  Our youngest was the biggest dare devil and loved every minute of it. Highly recommend booking a private tour (Jamaica Xplored, Glen) since you get a great personal experience.  The guides there will take pictures with your camera if you have a waterproof one, Glen was able to take many with my own camera so we could enjoy.  There were a few sections to this area as well, sunscreen was not really needed either.  After jumping at one site we walked through the ""jungle"" with a beverage to other areas to enjoy.  There were some vendors along the way as well as some cure stray dogs, one of which our kids named and wanted to bring back. :)"
Heart-pumping adventure in a beautiful setting,"Our guide for Blue Hole was Fabian - he did a great job both keeping us safe and getting us to push our boundaries a bit.  If you can choose your guide, ask for Fabian.  Blue Hole includes a series of dives in a gorgeous setting.  Fabian made this a fun event for me (the chicken of the group) and for my adventure-loving teen-age sons.  We all made the jumps and lived to tell about it!  Be sure to wear water shoes or good water sandals with decent grip on the bottom."
"chukka rafting ,Dune buggy,  Zip line with Blue Hole",This was an amazing experience. We booked though the Moon Palace Resort. It was a full day of adventure. Guides were great. While at Blue Hole (first stop )it was very rushed. My kids18 &15 loved it but unfortunately they were not aloud to do the jumps more than once  due to “time restrictions” . Blue Hole was beautiful and really fun if ever to go back I would definitely book by it’s self so we had more time to really  enjoy it longer .
A perfect day trip while in Jamaica,"The Blue Hole is a must see when in Jamaica, It has become more popular over the years and for those that love a more quiet environment as compared to Dunn's River you can't go wrong here. Water lovers and sightseers alike will love the Blue Hole, you can jump off high rocks and…"
Rushed,"The blue hole took forever to get to, and the tour itself didn’t last 30 minutes. The tour guide rushed us through the entire process. Despite that, the actual place is beautiful and worth a visit."
Amazing & Must Do,This place is amazing! Great tour guide that took over 200+ photos with one of our phones! Can’t say enough about this place. You won’t regret visiting this beautiful location.
What a thrill,"Marvyn paradise tour drove us here, Santa from island gully tour was our guide, he was great.  Will be back"
Fun & safe way to jump down waterfalls,"We did the Blue Hole as part of a jeep safari tour.  Our children (9 & 14) were the jumpers and had a great time.  You walk to the top and make your way down through progressive jumps, starting at about 5 feet, then an optional 20 foot jump at the end.  We parents were able to…"
BEAUTIFUL TURQUOISE WATER,"We had so much fun here, jumping off the rocks & the rope swing into the beautiful turquoise water & then walking further up a path to another water hole & being helped down a huge rock by our lovely guide whilst the water flowed over my legs & jumped in from a height, as I said…"
What an awesome day,We had an awesome experience at blue hole. The energy was magnificent. We were all crowned by this handsome hunk of Jamaica. Lunch was awesome and the grounds were spectacular. Thank you for making our excursion awesome.
Negril Blue Hole,Not super busy and easy to get to. Cost is only $10. Not a must see but kind of cool if you have the time.
Better Than Dunn’s River Falls,"Had a great time at the Blue hole. It was a lot of fun jumping into the blue water and being surrounded by all the amazing nature. Last year I did Dunn’s River Falls, I enjoyed the Blue  Hole a lot more. DRF was a lot colder & more of  a strenuous/dangerous hike. Trust me the…"
Jumping off EVERYTHING,You get to jump off waterfalls and rope swings. What else needs said? Plus find yourself a good guide and I’m sure you can access some hidden jumps...
Awesome  adventure,"Great time with a great guide Odenea(sorry if misspelled). He was very entertaining,energetic and helpful  along the trail."
Blue jewel of Ocho Rios!,This was one of the highlights of our 8 day cruise in the Western Caribbean! We arrived at Blue Hole in the morning when crowds were very light. The road up to the attraction was both scenic and harrowing. It was very doable by the drivers though. After arriving we connected…
Great fun,One of the best excursions I've done in my travels. The jumps at different heights is so much fun! I woukd definitely advise people to check it out!
Great place and really fun people!,We drove ourselves to this place!  It was not that far from Negril!  The people that were there was so fun and make you feel right at home!  If your daring take the plunge off the cliff if not climb down the ladder!  When your down there get a limestone facial!  After your done…
For Lovers of Adventure,"If you're a lover of adventure or nature, then this is certainly the place for you. Blue Hole is a hidden gem located in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. Both locals and tourist may indulge in this majestic experience at an affordable cost."
Liked it,Went there after dolphins cove in ocho Rios with private transfer. Short but ok. Fun for kids. No need for shoes
Hanging Out,We were in the area and decided to stop by and just to let you know we weren’t disappointed. You have to use a tour guide and if you are a adventurous person then this is the spot the water is lovely especially if you love to swim but if you can’t swim just keep on your life…
So much more!,"You'd think this would be a single hole, with a rock to jump from.  Its not.  Its a sequence of holes to whet your appetite, and get you warmed up for the final jump from a ledge way up high.  The Chukka team made us feel at home, and assisted us crossing the slippery spots. …"
Don’t miss the Blue Hole,"Trey and Odain were our guides at the Blue Hole. They were amazing, we had so much fun here. If you want to have a bit of adventure but still feel safe, these are the guys you want by your side."
Beautiful and fun! ,"The blue hole was magnificent! Beautiful water, fantastic views and a grate guide.  The only downside is that the guide expects a tip as big as the entrance fee. We did not know this and was a bit chocked by the fact that a guide was mandatory and expected 20 US$/h per person…"
Our favorite day in Jamaica!,"The water is perfection, the people are friendly, and the adventure is real! While hiking in, our guides pointed out medicinal plants, let us smell lime and lemongrass leaves, and taught us about the surrounding community. We couldn't get enough of the rope swings and we didn't want to leave."
Stunning waters ,There are several things to do here. I recommend spending the whole day. The water is an insane blue. Reminds me of cool blue Gatorade or that one cloudy neon blue koolaid.  The water is perfect. The mud is life changing. Jumping off a waterfall was incredible. A special thank you to Pablo tours for recommending this location to us.
Blue Hole trip,We were escorted to the Blue Hole by our tour guide Melissa Smart of Mello Tours. The location was as beautiful as we were told. Upon arrival we were introduced to our personal guides Troy and Timoy from the Blue Hole. They guided us patiently and safely trough the entire waterfall excursion. They were encouraging us and very sweet. Making sure that whatever we wanted to do we were always in the safest of hands. It was a remarkable day thanks to them all.
Blue Hole (awesome),"Me and my 10 year old son did the Blue hole excursion this month. with Marvyn's Paradise Tours. We went to Dunn's river first and then to the Blue hole. My son thought Dunn's river was okay, but he LOVED the Blue Hole.  Our guide Odean made him feel safe and brought him out of his comfort zone. He was doing jumps off the ledges that he wouldn't normally do, because he's afraid of heights. The highlight of his day was the swing at the end, which he did that about five times. The scenery was beautiful and all of the staff was polite and friendly. My son and I, both recommend this stop. You won't be disappointed!"
The Ultimate Jamaican Vacation ,"The Blue Hole in Ocho Rios is absolutely beautiful!  The Falls and Water is breathtaking. The workers jump the rocks like Billy Goats to help you get through the water to view the top of the falls. It is kind of chaotic with the amount of people in lines whom want to jump, swing from the t-bar and picture taking, but worth the trip for the experience!!"
Beautifull place,"I never saw a fall with so beatifull water. So blue, so clean. You have to pay 15 US dolar to enter and pay more the tour guide, its expensive, but if you like nature, go!"
Just jump!,I knew I wanted to go to the Blue Hole and I’m so glad that we did!  It was beautiful and exciting.  I jumped from platforms far higher than I ever thought I would.  Our tour guide Julian was great.  Not only was he helpful and encouraging but he was also funny and a total dare…
If you like to JUMP,Great time. Cheap. Reasonably priced. Jumps starts small and then increase. Tramp down the rock to jump was exhilarating. Must do if you like action.
Refreshing Day at Blue Hole,"What a great place to cool down on a hot summer day in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.  The Blue hole is down in a valley and surrounded by trees and shade.  Temperatures dropped like 10 degrees there and it was refreshing.  Lots of little and big rocks and platforms to jump off of and into…"
Blue Hole,I would recommend this to everybody so much fun and a great guide made sure I was safe as I’m not a great swimmer and pointing out plants and things to us
gorgeous hidden jem,"We visited the blue hole this past week (March 2019) as part of an excursion package booked through our resort.   It is absolutely gorgeous.   We researched ahead of time and purposefully booked a day when less cruise ships were due in port, we got there at approximately 9 a.m.…"
"Beautiful area, although be prepared to climb","This was an absolutely beautiful hike and swimming outing.  The local guides were extremely helpful and mindful of all the different people navigating the rocks and water, even people like me who can be clumsy.    At the time, it did not seem to physically impactful, but you…"
Awesome!,We had a group of eight and had an awesome time!!  Romaine was our guide and he was entertaining from the moment we met him to the moment we said goodbye.  The area is breathtakingly beautiful and we loved jumping off the various rocks and platforms.  I was a bit scared to jump…
Blue Hole ,Fun and relaxing place. Absolutely beautiful place to visit just be prepared to climb. It was a wonderful experience.
If you're going to Blue Hole ask for Blacks and use Dwight @ Humming Bird Tours to get there,"We are a group of three girls traveling alone and Dwight was our main driver across Jamaica and hands down one of the ssfest, trustworthy, reliable and cost effective people we've met out here - definitely recommend especially with how much of a rip off people can be. His…"
Popps is Great,"Had a great time, Popps was amazing, fantastic kid and tour guide highlighting everything that makes Jamaica one of the most beautiful places on earth.  His knowledge of the flora and fauna is exceptional and his smile infectious.  I hope everyone could be as lucky as us to have…"
HAD AN AMAZING DAY ,"My son, friends and I went to the Blue Hole.  We had an amazing time. The guides were brilliant and lots of fun.  We spent a few hours there.  It is really worth going to.  Very exciting time we had.  Go enjoy. Me  "
Suprising,"Beautiful falls, we were taken up the falls by 2 very good guides. The waterfalls consist of several falls with a few blue holes in the front. It is really beautiful and you can do a lot of thingssuch as small and high jumps, a swing, jumping from a fall and crawling through a…"
Incredibly beautiful,"The trip to the blue hole shouldn't be missed when staying at a place close to Ocho Rios. It is absolutely stunning, totally beautiful and also a bit adventurous. Troj was our guide and did a great job! He took pictures and videos of everything we did and we constantly felt safe…"
Jump in,"The Blue Hole, also called the Island Gully Falls, is a beautiful location about half an hours drive from Ocho Rios. It's a fairly simple hike and swim to the top where the fun really begins. Here you climb rocks and steps to points from which you jump 10 to 25 or so feet into…"
An adventure,"Visited with our family of four, and it was quite the adventure. First, make sure to go to the island gulley website for step by step directions to get here, and go through the chain link fence to the official guides in black shirts. Those outside the gates are very aggressive…"
Worth The Trip,This place was recommended by many of our friends that had travelled to Jamaica before. Our hotel arranged for a driver to take us there. Since we were staying at Sandals Ochi we were only about 20 minutes from it. Buy and bring your own water shoes to Jamaica if you decide you…
Beautiful day at Blue Hole,"Had Darrian as my personal guide.  He took his time and took lots of pictures along the way.  I always felt safe.  I jumped all the falls, and chose to wear a life jacket.  This took about an hour to climb and jump.  The water was colder than I expected!"
Beautiful and Exciting,"Beautiful area where you can have a low key good time or jump off of rocks for a more exciting time. Our guide ""LITTLE T"" was incredible and I highly recommend requesting him."
Highlight of our trip,"We actually ended up here by accident.  We had booked a private car to take us, but we had meant to do Dunne's River Falls and my sister told the driver the wrong place!  :)  It was a VERY happy accident!  We arrived late in the day (about 4ish) and it was perfect.  There was…"
Dive in gorgeous blue waters!,We had the most fun doing several jumps into turquoise blue waters at different places along the waterfall. Dante was our guide and he did a fantastic job!
Great experience !,Beautiful place - probably better than Dunns river falls as there’s more to do ! ( as long as you like heights !)Jumping into lagoons from a platform and a rope swing ! Couldn’t climb down waterfall though - too scary!The guides were so fit throwing themselves from a great height - not for the faint hearted !Lots of photo opportunities !Highly recommended!
Best of Ocho!,"What an amazing experience. Our driver Dalton gave us the VIP tour at Blue Hole. Not for the faint of heart. Mike the guide helped us to a behind the scenes tour of the beautiful diving waterfalls nestled in the jungles outside of Ocho. He & Timoy, who helped take some wonderful pics, were most helpful in giving my brother and I a true Jamaican experience 😉 Don’t miss this hidden gem in paradise! 🇯🇲🌴"
Hidden (Blue) Gem in Ocho Rios,"Our trip to the Blue Hole came highly recommended to us by a private driver we hired. We expressed to him, ""we don't want to go to all the overpopulated tourist attractions"", but really want to experience some the amazing not so well know adventures in Ochoy. And the Blue Hole did not disappoint! We spent about two hours diving into the natural pools. This is defiantly a physical activity, but the guides are very helpful. Life vest are also provided for those us not so confident swimmers."
Unexpected Adventure,We upgraded to include this so we didn't know what to expect when we arrived. It was just a fun morning of jumping into beautiful pools at the base of waterfalls. The guides were great! We were with Troy and Samuel.
Fun Spot for all,"We spent two hours at Blue Hole enjoying the lush, natural waterfall and ""pool"". The guide we chose was friendly, communicated well and very accommodating. Jumping into the water was fun and catching a massage from the cascading water was bonus! The heavy downpour of rain…"
unbelievable time,"Booked our excursion through travelocity ""Blue Hole & Island Gully Waterfall Adventure with Lunch""and arranged a pickup at a nearby hotel, since we stayed at an Airbnb. We were picked up and spent about a little over an hr picking up the remaining 18 participants for the…"
Amazing Experience,The Waterfall and the experience was so Awesome. Dillion and ODean really made sure that we had a great time while we were here. Definitely a hidden gem!
As good as everyone says,"What everyone else said is right on, I have not much to add.  Beautiful, raw Jamaican river and 78-degree freshwater waterfalls.   Up to 20-ft jumps into the pools!  Don't think, just jump!"
Beautiful and Thrilling,"This place is a must-do in Jamaica. Wear good water shoes for the hike in and the climbing as you ascend the different levels of the waterfall. Our guide, Kemmy, was wonderful. He was careful to make sure we were safe the whole time and stopped at all the great spots to ensure…"
Amazing experience!,"We used Marvyn’s paradise tours to take us to the blue hole and Dunn’s River Falls. He arranged for Odean to take us through the jumps, and he was absolutely amazing!  We would have never done it without his guidance all the way and he took videos and pictures all throughout! …"
Place is amazing,The waterfalls beautiful and the cliff jumping is not for the squeamish. Well worth the trip off the coast. We went with a local tour guide. Beware of the guy handing out Red Stripes in the middle. He will expect to be paid for the beer after you are done. 
Best day of our trip to Ocho Rios,We took a taxi To the Blue Hole. Our driver Oneil hooked us up with a guide named Dante. He was the greatest. He took our camera and took pics. Encouraged us to do all the jumps. Better than Dunn's River Falls. Unbelievably beautiful. We will definitely go back and ask for Dante.
Best Excursion During Our Times in Jamaica!,"Booked a tour to the blue hole from Discovery Bay through Chukka tours.  We lucked out with our driver and tour guide, Barbie!  Barbie provided us with a history of the island on the way to the Blue Hole. She pointed out all of the local plants, trees, and fruits growing in the…"
Awesome Experience,I cannot say enough about how welcoming and helpful those sweet gents are at the Blue Hole.  I was very nervous about climbing the rock stairs and jumping into the pools.  Courtney stayed with me every step of the way jumping with me each time.  Along with the rest of the team I…
A true paradise,I went in 2016 before this got popular and I climbed down the big waterfall.. Glad it appears to still be pretty much the same (except maybe safer). It was the best excursion ever! Still keep in contact with the locals there because they were such wonderfully amazing people!  Look forward to returning soon . Much love
BEST excursion in OCHI!,"This was by far our favorite of 7 excursions so far! We went for the 3 in 1, zip line, blue hole, rafting. The zip line was not really worth the time it took to harness up. The tubing was fun, however the Blue Hole was the best!"
Beautiful water holes in the jungle,"Thankful to have had a private tour!  We spent a while at Blue Hole, beginning at the base, just past where you pay your entrance fee.  Grateful for the clean bathrooms.  We jumped off cliffs and swung like tarzan into the water, took pictures below.  From here, we took pics on a fall area.  Both places it felt like we were the only ones there.Gradually we got to an area where there were loads of people from big tour groups.  I was thankful to have been on a more intimate tour (@JamrcockJourney's).  My husband and brother-in-law walked down a waterfall area that has grooves in it, with our guide Marvin and jumped from halfway down.  In this same area, there is a platform at least 30 ft high that people jumped from.  At this point, we headed back to where we started.  It's a beautiful area that I would come back to.  My only complaint is that they should take some of the money they earn and clean things up a bit."
Amazing experience away from the tour groups,"We had a driver who took us to Blue Hole at his recommendation at about 10am and it was fantastic. We understood that there are two points you can start the ""tour"" from (top of the waterfalls or the bottom). We started from the bottom which is apparently unregistered with the tourist board but the quality was still great! We paid 15USD each and 12USD for water shoes (definitely take if you already have) and our guide, Tyrone, led us up the wild path to the main falls used by his tour company. He led me then my friend directly onto the falls and walked us down to a point from which it was safe to jump into the blue pool below. There were multiple points to jump in and swim from and the guide will take you around for about an hour, which is plenty time. There were very few other people around so you could really appreciate the natural beauty of the spot. Tyrone told us a bit about Jamaica and the falls and was also very careful to point out roots or dips in the path- very safety conscious. You don't need to be particularly fit to do this activity but good balance and a sense of adventure!"
Amazing natural wonder,"A beautiful place to visit.  The guides are friendly and helpful and want to make sure you have the best experience.   The Blue Hole is run by locals and employs local youth,( tip them well) so the money stays in Ocho, which was important to us."
Highlight Excursion,AWESOME AWESOME   NICO was our guide he took real good care of us..water was gorgeous refeshing my kids couldn't get enough.. definitely a must..
AMAZING,"We had a private tour through Marvyn's Paradise tours and Blue Hole was one of our stops. It was amazing! Our guide, Dario, was incredibly helpful and friendly. I recommend this destination and will visit again!"
Was disappointed,"We were so excited for this place. It was so rushed. We only got to jump 5 times, then were directed to look at the pictures taken. A co worker of mine went about 5 years ago, before it became for touristy. They spent hours there, jumping multiple time. I figured that would be…"
Fun to the end,The blue hole is something that everyone should try for at least once in there life it's AWESOME!!! I went with my family that were visiting Jamaica for the first time they had a great time WITH no regrets
Excursion,"Our driver Norman drove us to this excursion giving us lots of local history and showing us attractions along the way. We arrived early in the morning and we were greeted by our friendly tour guide. Our guide was really great, he made sure we had fun and that we stayed ahead of…"
Unbelievable!,The Blue Hole is another must see attraction and is very close to Dunns River Falls.  First you can swing off a rope or dive off a rock about 30 feet high in a 35 foot deep lagoon. Then there are several platforms to jump off at different spots along the River. After a short…
Excellent,We went to Dunn's river falls and our driver from Jackie's Jamaican tours suggested here after lunch. Wow is all I can say our guide was superb and what he had my husband and 2 children doing was amazing. Children said this was far better than Dunn's and it was in a natural…
A must!!!,"This has by far been my favorite tour out of all the countys I have gone too. If you are in Jamaica you have to go on this tour!! if your hotel doesn't offer it, hire a cab we did. I promise you wont be disappointed!!! ***** "
Amazing time,"Had a great time at the Blue Hole!    For those who are not mobile inclined, there is A LOT of hiking.    Definitely wear hiking shoes or water shoes with good grip.  I watched others jump off into the hole, but they do have lifejackets.  You can swim behind the waterfall and do…"
Been to Blue Hole and Dunn’s River Falls- Blue Hole was my Favorite!,"We were just in Jamaica with friends and they wanted to do an excursion. Since out of the 6 of us only my husband and I had been to Dunn’s River Fslls, the group spent time deciding between Dunn’s and Blue Hole. We are so happy we went to a Blue Hole! What a treasure! We used a…"
Beautiful,Absolutely gorgeous! Beautiful and natural settings. The water falls were beautiful and the water so clear. The guides were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend seeing this beautiful setting.
Extreme ,So much fun!  Omar is a crazy guide and the best person!  The Blue Hole is definitely a must see for water and adventure loving families and people. 
Awesome Stop,Take a plunge in the beautiful waters. Just amazing. Coach Alex was wonderful and helped us every step of the way. 
Great half day trip,"Great spot to spend a few hours in Ocho Rios. Very affordable if you drive yourself, 2000 Jamaican Dollars (15 USD or 20 CAD) each for entrance and guide through the falls. If you do drive yourself make sure you continue driving until you reach the chain link double gate with…"
It's only deceptively dangerous and you'll feel a hero if you jump!,"Another Jamaican water course that would be a paradise if it didn't attracts 100s at a time to its clenched-buttock thrills, and all the merchandise (including spliff) sellers to the thronging tourists. Unusually grippy, stepped rock formations that allow you to walk down and up…"
Blue Hole and photos from Blue Hole Shack - its a must do !!,Great experience!! Even better than Dunns river! Try get guide called Javier. - He really encouraged us and made sure we were safe on all the pools. And amazingly he got us to climb down the almost vertical waterfall which looked an impossible feat when we arrrived. The jumps…
My favorite part,"Small groups, early morning, PERFECT WATER! The group leaders were fun and energetic!  Always joking and making you feel comfortable if you are nervous about jumping!"
I had a ball!,"Booked excursion through cruise ship with Chukka.  Bit of confusion as to what tour included. Advertised as Blue Hole and River Rafting.  Small print specified River Tubing -- big difference which upset some on our tour.  Anyway, we were picked up in crowded mini-buses at the…"
Amazing,"We did this excursion through Real Jamaica Tours. They were fantastic. The place itself is picturesque. I hate that you can't hold you phone the whole time taking pics! It is fairly strenuous. You should have a decent pair of water shoes. They do sell some @ the hole, but I…"
Must See!!!,You must come here!!! Our lifeguard Triston was amazing. He was so patient with our friend who does not swim. By the end of the trip she was swimming. The waterfalls are amazing. The water is beautiful. You have an option of jumping from different altitudes. So there is…
Beautiful waterfalls ,Definitely recommend it!awesome  hike upbtonthe the waterfalls and blue hole amazing! Beautiful rainforest and waterfalls!
"Perfect cruise stop and #1 tour guide, ODEAN!","Like most people, we had heard Blue Hole was a must do while on a Cruise stop in Ocho Rios. Unlike most, we do not like ship excursions and crowded tours. We opted to get a private driver for the day for our group of 4 through Marvyn's Paradise Tours. When we arrived at Blue Hole, we were given VIP treatment and a tour for just our group of 4, avoiding the large group tours. Our driver set us up with our Amazing Tour Guide, Odean! Odean took us to the front of every line, we had a personal photographer with photos to purchase at the end of the tour AND he made us crowns made from leaves. We had one person in our group that could not jump from the waterfalls and he was very patient to take her to easy lookouts where she could cheer us on and take some photos. I agree with all of the reviews that Blue Hole is a must see!"
Best Excursion,"If you are in the Ochos Rios area, this is a MUST DO. The scenery is breathtaking and you can do some optional cliff jumping and swim in the water. Our taxi driver took us to the very top. There are two other blue hole stops on the way up, but he said that the top is the original property owner who opened the blue hole and the only one of the three that is actually insured. It’s also a great way to see more of the countryside on the way there from wherever you are staying. We booked the tour that also had the river tubing and that was also a good time. Our whole family agrees that this was the favorite excursion of our vacation."
A must do!,What an amazing experience! Riley and Odea were our guides and made sure we pushed ourselves yet made us feel safe.  We came with a large group and we all had a blast!  Well worth the trip!  Our guides went the extra mile and made all the ladies heAd dresses.
Family excursion ,This was a lot of fun. Our older kids 14 & 15 loved jumping! Our 8 year old daughter was scared to death but they were so good to her! She jumped off the first smaller spot with me but then the nerves got the better of her. Our guide scooped her up and carried her down to meet me after I jumped. Absolutely beautiful here!
fun,"A lovely place.  The guides are helpful, making sure that you're safe while sharing information about the local area. A fun place to spend a couple of hours."
Great Value,One of the best parts of my trip was going to the Blue Hole! All the guides make sure your safe and have a fun time.
Beautiful a must see and do! ,I have been to Jamaica several times and this was my first time visiting blue hole it was so beautiful we went twice during our stay. The guides are friendly and helpful. We had our 7 month old baby with us and she was able to float in the river with a floatation device.
Would do it Again,"We visited the blue hole falls for a day of tours with Globe Trotter Adventure Tours, it was the most fun we have had on any excursion. The water was a beautiful blue, cool and refreshing. The guides were so helpful, we climbed the falls, swung from the rope and jumped from the ledge. Its a bit deep so best for able swimmers, we had a great time."
Highlight of our Jamaica trip!,We (14 of us total ranging in age from 9-70) were deciding between Dunn’s River Falls and the Blue Hole and so glad that we chose the Blue Hole. A friend who was with us told us that Dunn’s River Falls gets very crowded and you are basically walking/climbing up the side of the Falls and just looking at the Falls. As soon as we got to the Blue Hole we got paired up with these awesome guides. Their names were Val and Odean. I highly recommend requesting them specifically as they were so beyond helpful and patient with our huge group. The Falls are spectacular to look at but getting the chance to jump off the Falls in 4-6 different spots was the highlight. You don’t have to do any jumps but have the option to do them all. The fresh/cool water feels amazing! And $15 per person is nothing for this experience. Visiting these Falls is a no brained! Loved it!
Blue Hole,"Like others, we were planning on going to Dunn’s River Falls, but some locals told us Blue Hole was better and less crowded.  We went on a day when there were no cruise ships and we were the only ones there.  It was beautiful, the water and falls were amazing and we had so much…"
Great stop at Blue Hole,"Blue Hole was one of 3 stops during our day in Jamaica and it was by far our favorite.  Ricardo was our guide and he was FANTASTIC!  He not only was our guide but was our photographer.  He took my camera and took shots of our family climbing and jumping, pictures of the scenery,…"
Beautiful,I hadn't heard of the Blue Hole before going to Jamaica. We were at a resort and they suggested we use one of thier trust worthy locals to take us where we want to go. The Blue Hole was a must!!  It is absoluetly beautiful!!  I will definately visit it again the next time we go…
So much fun and absolutely beautiful! ,We were brought here by our driver from Julio Tours based on his recommendation. We originally planned Dunn's River but advised this was better as it was less busy. So glad we listened.  Blue hole was beautiful! Lots of ropes and jump to jump into the crystal clear blue water.…
Great time with Javier,"We went on a tour with our guide Javier, (arranged by Dr Fun Tours, Delton). He was awesome and so was the adventure.   We are very glad we took the time to do this tour. Great day!  Bryan & Carol"
This was rad!,"Our driver Ian with Irie Holiday Tours took us here upon request. He explained how much Jamaica is changing over the years. Irie Holiday Tours is a small, locally JAMAICA owned company and I highly recommend them because Ian is so considerate of his customers, there's no…"
Absolutely beautiful!,My boyfriend and I took the best of Ocho Rios tour which includes the blue hole which is absolutely amazing!! The water is so clear and refreshing.

He was patient, kind, knowledgeable and…"
Fun at the blue hole,"Amazing trip traveling through the small villages getting to the blue hole.   Highly recommend this one,but don't get the tube combo! Tube was more lazy river less thrill ride."
Trip,We went on a team bonding exercise and I most say I did not regret it. The drive up was very fun. The name fits the place water is blue and lovely. The guides are fun I would recommend this place.
"BETTER THAN DUNN""S RIVER FALLS?","Blue hole is best described as a city of water. Not only do you have the blue hole itself but you also have island gully falls within walking distance.  There are also many mini streams falls where you can lavish and bath in.  Best advise i can give is get a pair of water shoes,…"
