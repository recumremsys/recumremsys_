Good place,The rides are really goodBut need more entertainment for babies Dolphin show is amazing thank you everyone
Excellent,Enjoyed our trip the park was so clean everyone was smiling good place good hospitality great roller coasters
Perfect for the whole family,Not expecting much we were totally surprised from the minute we arrived until the moment we left.Expect to get wet for the whole day and during Covid the wait for rides was almost non existant and plenty of social distancing.
Pay?,"You get in free if you stay at Rixos, it you pay for everything else.Why would you pay for food when you are on all inclusive? Not for older travelers."
Perfecttt,Nice üáπüá∑üòç Turkish people are amazing we love the atmosphere in here will definitely come back again
Antalya training camp,It was such amazing experience and irem were sl friendly and helpful üòçüòçThe place is so fun and and easy to find everything.
Great,I loved everything here and everything here amazing Perfect place and everything you‚Äôll need you‚Äôll find it here ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fantastic Place but Cursory COVID Precautions,"We went in September. The park is split into wet and dry sections. About a third of the wet park was sectioned off and closed, but we didn't realise until we looked at a map later. Of the remaining rides, almost everything was open. We had day tickets and felt we could have stayed much longer. We had an absolutely amazing time. Lockers were really useful to store our stuff and just wandered in flip-flops and wrap, which we could store by every ride. The rides themselves were great fun and we laughed lots.That said, why the 3 star review? Primarily two reasons. Firstly, the queues were really long. When the queue timers said 30 mins, the reality was more like an hour - basically double any time they give. After taking over an hour for her first ride we bought fast passes. After that we could do about a ride every 15 mins, including travelling between them. Sometimes 5 or 6 an hour. But it does add ¬£20 to each ticket.Secondly, COVID. Yes, there were announcements to request social distancing and appreciate it'd be difficult to wear masks on the rides, but the park's attitude appeared to be a tick box exercise. The queues had markers on the floor to distance, but the zigzag setup meant you were packed in tight anyway and nobody paid any attention to the markers. All the rubber rings were theoretically placed in a pile to be disinfected between uses, but people were just throwing them anywhere so only a few got cursory wipes. Supposedly they checked to make sure only family units sat next to each other on rides but we were not asked. They need to do more."
Good one,Very clean with professional staff everyone was helpful but it was too hot and crowded yet we love here
Wonderful,Everything is wonderfull..! We have so much fun..!Thanks Legends team...you madde for everthing for us and children
Decent fun park,"I would like to mention that I only had a one day stay there during COVID pandemic, in September. Well, nobody cared about COVID and restrictions or anything else. It was a normal day, with people rounding and aligning at queues. Amazing!Besides that, the place looks good, with things to do for everyone, but it like a jungle there. You have to love crowded places, must not go with kids or just stay with them at kids pools and fun areas.Overall, you have to plan your trip to Land of Legends perfectly, in order to get the best out of it"
Rana,Very good really enjoyed clean park good helpful staff you can enjoy all rides lots to see .lovedDolphine show and food is good .
"Fun day, lots to do","We visited this park on our trip to Antalya in Turkey. We arranged the trip through a tour operator close to our hotel, the price was 70 euros per adult ticket which included transfer and the visit to the park. We were told this included soft drinks and food but this wasn‚Äôt the case. First off we absolutely loved the water park, probably the best one I‚Äôve been to. Lots of water activities for all ages, theme park rides and a dolphin show included in the ticket price. Before any water ride you are weighed (max weight is 120kg per person or 180kg between 2 people), we didn‚Äôt go to the dolphin show or to the theme park. The staff are friendly and helpful, not a lot of them speak English so we did have to improvise but not a massive problem. There are lockers/changing facilities however we didn‚Äôt use these. We set up for the day at the wave pool, there‚Äôs a small locker (could easily fit phones, purses, cameras etc). We inserted a 50 cents coin and were able to leave our stuff with peace of mind. You are given a wristband upon entry to the park and you can put money on the wristband so you don‚Äôt have to carry your purse/wallet around with you.Only downsides really is that the food and drinks are really expensive, we spent around 60 euros for 2 adults. That was 1 meal each and around 2/3 soft drinks each. Another downside was the floor, it‚Äôs really hard to walk on and quite painful but you can‚Äôt wear your flip flops when you‚Äôre in the queues for the rides at the water park so I‚Äôd recommend swim shoes as some people seemed to have these on. Another downside was covid related as nobody seemed to social distance (sometimes you can queue for 30+ mins for one ride), the staff do have Facemasks on however it was the other guests I was concerned about as we were in close proximity for a decent period. Would definitely recommend coming here even if it‚Äôs just adults, definitely with children if you‚Äôre visiting Antalya or areas around the park. We had a really fun day."
S√ºper,Evreything so much good stat friendly evet enjoyed say was thank you for all ee wil coming NeXT yarar again
Very good park,It was a very good park. There were lots of things to do such as rollercoasters and water slides. The wait was only 30 mins max for the slides and I would definitely recommend.Mehmet surmeli was very nice
Great day out,It was the roller coasters that were really good. I think everything else was very good too especially the water rides.
Amazing Park,Had a lovely day at Land of Legends theme park. Highly recommended to all of the family. We loved the dolphin show and seeing the sea lion. The park is beautifully presented . 10/10 for us üëçüèª Mehmet was lovely and asked how out day was and of there was anything else he could do. All the staff are really helpful and friendly .
"A good day out, but very over priced.","Came here in September 2020, mainly to visit the water park. Which in itself was amazing, but at ‚Ç¨75 for 2 tickets, and once in the park, a 10 inch pizza, a medium sized burger and chips & 4 cans of coke costing ‚Ç¨60 I can honestly say I‚Äôve never felt so ripped off in my life.There‚Äôs Plenty of other water parks in turkey to choose from, at a better value for money. Would not return here, and I will be advising anyone I know, who plans on coming to Antalya, to avoid this place at all costs."
We loved it!,"We visited it today and loved it! A lot of attractions for kids and adults. Everyone will enjoy this place! I want to highlight very good service. Very helpful staff, especially friendly guy Aslan Aslanodlu :)"
Fab ,"Been here a few times and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint .. so much to do .., lots of fun. Would recommend doing theme park upon arrival as far too long queue fit water slides. Food is over priced fast food.. but it‚Äôs not the sort of day where u would sit and have long relaxing lunch! Too busy with lots of fun rides.Would defo recommend!"
Unbelievable!,"Absolutely amazing day with my partner and friends. The rollercoasters feel so safe and sturdy, can honestly say they were smoother than in the UK so it was much more enjoyable and fun! The water slides were also amazing! They have a super wave pool and a lovely infinity pool with a glass surround so you can get photos. You put money into a wristband and spend it as you go so you don‚Äôt need to carry cash. We were there for one day so didn‚Äôt get chance to take full advantage of the shows and swimming with dolphins or the shopping avenue. If you want to go and do everything you‚Äôll need two days! Food was also great and greatly priced!"
Beautiful Day,My Favorite Part of the experience: the Delfin Show and swin. The stuff was friedly and the park was Very clean!!
STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!!!!!,"I could write an essay about how this place has the rudest staff members and how I was lied to upon arrival that all rides were working but just know that so much went wrong and when I went to discuss it with the manager on duty, It was as if I was speaking to an automated machine that could not take in what I was saying she was incredibly rude cutting me off every sentence and kept back tracking on her words. I made sure that I checked the rides were working prior to entering and was lied to that it wasn‚Äôt just so I could buy tickets. I was leaving Antalya the same day so I didn‚Äôt even want a refund or vouchers but just wanted to let the management know that people travel a long way to come there sometimes and we don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to.If you‚Äôre thinking about going have a plan b ready because trust me. I‚Äôm patient but they take the pi**  here.The place looks amazing and you would expect to have a good time but the staff need training on how to deal with customers.I attached an image of the management who was brazenly taking other calls cutting us off and extremely condescending when speaking ."
ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπŸá,The best holiday ever! The games are really funny and full of adrenaline for adults (hyper coaster) Every body needs to come here at least one time of their life. I want to come back with my friends and enjoy double fun! But you dont need friend here because staffs are really friendly and helpful. :) Special thank for Zeynep she was so nice and helpful to us. I want to see her again in the park. Thanks a lot for unforgettible holiday!
Great fun,"Great fun for adults and kids, magicon slides are the best experience. Also visit Masha and the bear for little ones,there house and show and you can meet them at food station. Personal are very pleasent and always happy to help, smiling and hospitable,specially Zeynep :))))) thanks for wonderful day"
Good but overpriced!,A day trip with my 4 & 5 year old the place is amazing the way is build very good and kids enjoyed the day here! But really I think is far too expensive we paid like ‚Ç¨50 per person just to enter in 4 of us ‚Ç¨200 as we enter in then my little ones wanted some lollipops üç≠at one of the shops there so I bought 3 cost me ‚Ç¨5 ü§∑ lollipops really!!
Weak,"This year compared to other years, the slides went only half of them. Those that were very crowded and if you wanted to choose not to stand in line you can pay extra. In 3 hours I came across 3 slides, an unforgettable experience to say the least."
Great Day out,Expensive but well worth the money.  Great rides and great day out for all ages. Its the first time ive ever been to a water park where you can just go and jump on a roller coaster in your swim gear.  Great idea my kids loved it.
Good but expensive..,"Given some rides were closed due to COVID, ¬£180 for the day for 4. If you're Turkish though you get in for half price!Shopping avenue is beautiful and the hotel looks amazing."
Amazing holiday ,"I have just spent a week here in turkey at the land of legends rixos hotel and theme park, myself, my son ages 9 and my parents, we all had an amazing holiday here at the land of legends, i found the added benefits of the rixos facilities most favorable, the beach is amazing and the food in the rixos is delicious and we were absolutely spoilt for choice with options to choose, all delicious...... and the service is incredible. they even offer night time entertainment at the rixos, and the added bonus to the land of legends show, then being able to enjoy the theme park with my son along with the beach hotel at the rixos just made it the perfect all in all holiday with the best of everything to choose. my advise is to stay at the rixos which also provide themed land of legends rooms, all inclusive is all inclusive the cocktails are to die for, in the theme park there is a selected amount of all inclusive available where as in the rixos Hotel everything is all in, I loved listening to the piano, the live band, the music is great, service is excellent, we will definitely be visiting again next year and already can not wait to come back, also the people are all friendly and everyone including all the children play together very well, my son had no problems making loads of very good friends and had a great time, he enjoyed everything about this holiday. thank you so much. also thanks to the roller skater waitors around the pool, also the dancers in the theme park, also the dolphin show is excellent. Myself and my son swam with the dolphins which was an excellent experience, my son really enjoyed this, to swim with the dolphins is extra for both myself and son was around ¬£200, definitely worth it, also my son loved the roller coaster rides, the slides, the slides are a little longer to que although they do seem to get quite towards the late afternoon, you can also keep track of the waiting times, the wave pool is amazing we had a great time in there, they definitely make this a fun time and everyone joins in the fun together. In the theme park you are unable to use cash or card to purchase added items which are extra charge as apose to your inclusive items, to purchase and pay for extra charged items you need to put money on your wrist band which you can do this in the hotel reception, or in the theme park at the main entrance and also near the wave pool...... all the staff are helpful, polite and friendly although in the theme park some do struggle to speak english and have difficulty's advising and understanding to which in some cases you kind of find out as you go. So be sure to follow the travel guide, and also the theme park map and information. The night time show at the land of legends which starts about 10pm each evening is absolutely beautiful, although each night it is the same so I recommend maybe planning your week around all the different choices to make the most of the availabilitys!!! My son loved being able to play in the land of legends arcades which is also included in your all inclusive package, the land of legends Hotel is amazing and all set out to suit your children, my son lost his phone at least twice and my mum also lost her phone and each time was handed in and returned to them both, the hotel is safely camered up so you feel comfortable knowing whilst the kids play there safe inside the hotel whilst making friends in the arcades, all in all this as to have been one of my favourite holidays thanks to all who made it extra special, üëç"
Perfect,It was really fun and perfect entertainment for the family. There is many rides and shows that is perfect for everyone. The staff was very helpful.
Great day out,This is a fantastic fun filled day out.Worth getting the fast pass to beat the queues.The rides are excellent especially the roller coasters.Swimming with the dolphins was the highlight of the day.Only one ride closed due to covid.We ate food in a pub in shopping centre bye the hotel excellent food.Lockers are provided Wrist bands can be loaded with cash to get drinks etc around the park no cash needed except at the shopping centre area.
The place and staff are not trained for people with disabilities. ,"We visited here on two separate occasions one day the theme park and then going in the shops. The other day in the water park. I have two children with Autism, ADHD, Sensory, learning difficulties, and challenging behaviours ++. We visited in Covid , and I understand that everyone needs to wear a mask. We were happy to wear masks, but the staff in the shops were very rude to you if the children did not wear masks. Even when I explained that they had learning difficulties ( it‚Äôs plain to see) and they cannot wear them due to having a meltdown ! They insisted on them standing outside the shop on their own. I did not understand this when in the airport this was not imposed ???? My son has a fear of water in his face, so I took him to the baby area. He wears a swim jacket as he feels he may drown in two inches of water. The life Guard insisted he took it off, even again after I explained his needs. No again, no allowance for special needs. What harm was he doing ? I asked the lifeguard if I could take him to the top of a small slide. As he was nervous, and wanted me to come. No again. We have been to Disney many times before, and when entering the hotel this was the feel I think they were portraying. Think again Land of legends, because you are not inclusive of all."
"Good day,  Younger ones enjoyed it more than older ones","Took a trip here with our family whilst staying at the Adalya Elite Lara. We had a good day, we split up so that the younger ones could go on rides and older kids could go on the roller coasters. The younger ones seemed to have more fun as there were more rides. The older ones did just 3 rides in one morning, the queues were too much for them and unlike Florida parks there is no reprieve from the heat of the day!We spent the afternoon at the pools and although enjoyable was really not much better than our own hotel.When choosing our holiday we were split between the hotel here and our own hotel and after visiting the park we were so happy we hadnt chosen to stay here. Seems like a park just plonked in the middle of nowhere. We were quite happy to return to our hown hotel. Although had a great day, we wouldnt return."
Not bad,"Went to this theme park with my sister and nephew unfortunately most the rides only allowed you to go on if you was 120cm my nephew was 115cm however we still went on a few rides so it wasnt bad at all, hardly any ques cost about ¬£47 each total."
Land of legend experience,"It was very very fun here , very worth it . The staff are really friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place ."
Satisfied,Firstly  I would like to recommend  to everyone we really  enjoyed  in the beginning  we had couple of problems  . Which is in some part of the place but there was a sme helpful and kind staff (mehmet&ali cem&kaan ) I appreciate  for their service we are satisfied . Thanks
"NOT HERE, ethnically challenged people?","These people/ staff after paying to get in with my children having unlimited access to the water slides, after our non ethnic friends went to another/ bigger slide my children did not want to try thry refused to allow them to go down the same slide they had been enjoying that morning/ afternoon for no reason whatsoever & when questioned they pretend they can't understand & walk away laughing. Upon exiting the park when asked how was it I answerd your staff are racist & ruined our visit, when questioned i showed them the picture of the male who kicked my daughter off the slide forcing her to walk back down the stairway in tears saying shes not allowed & when i questioned him he laughed & walked off whilst radioing his staff friends to join in staring at the ethnic people & laughing as he tells them of his unjust refusal... When management are told this & shown the picture they pretend they cannot place the staff member & then further exacerbate asking if you want to wait a few to talk about it further after hey deny knowing the male refusing a child access to a slide i paid for. So NO please don't go here, Travel out of belek its ridiculous & the town folk will follow you, kids & all adults try forcing you to wear old fashioned  headwear that i suppose would make me look like a genie so please not here. I refuse to return to turkey with or without my children. Shop owners on the main roads are much better though and do not behave as such."
Unforgettible Day in The Land of Legends,"This is really lovely place, Theme park and aqua park every part of here is perfect and beautiful. Perfect place if you want to have fun. Delphine show was amazing and charming. I recommend this place to everyone."
Sunning place,Amazing experience at the park. And wonderful stay at the hotel. All staff were extremely friendly. Will definitely come again.
Very Good,Theme park was very good and very good customer service I recommended checking it out. Zeyneb Ergin helped us retrieve our bags when we couldn‚Äôt find them very good service.
Amazing day with kids,Amazing experience with the kids and the waterpark was amazing. There is so much to do so a whole day is required
Superb,Fantastic experience definitely recommend for family of all ages. Cleanliness second to none. Staff happy to help anytime.
Annoying,It never worths its money if u r going with toddlers It was just waste of time n money for us I never recommend it
great,"Great decorations, safe and fun aquapark. Definitely not supporting the dolphin shows other than that 10/10"
100%,"Great for the kids and adults also amazing day , plenty to do for everyone highly recommend, lots of food places to eat also"
Great Experience,"5D cinema. Myself, partner and child really enjoyed. Friendly staff and very helpful and welcoming. A great place and we would visit again.Zeynep was really helpful in getting us on the 5D cinema. She is a credit to the place."
"Awesome day, especially liked Zeynep, she was very helpful ","Great attractions and full day activities. Blue ride was the most dangerous and funny. 5/5 for sure, advise to visit to everyone!! Zeynep helped us with advises few times (answered all our funny questions)"
Awesome,"Everything is sooo greatI really like this theme park, its exciting, interesting, no bad words to sayAwesome!!!!"
Very fun,In winter we liked it here because of zainab she made our holiday really good and summer we came again
Amazing holiday in amazing Park,"The Land of Legends Theme Park is a very wonderful entertainment place, where you can get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãamazing emotions and have a good time, both with friends and with the whole family"
Great Theme Park,"This summer I came here for the first time and I really loved this place. Attractions are so awasome this place very beautiful. Specially aqua park! And staffs really helpful and hospitable, special thanks for Zeynep! We are going the come back!"
Perfect holiday,All of them. I'm pleasure for LoL. Extream holiday in LoL. Guest service Hakan is the most populer and interest person for me.
Thanks a lot,It was an awesome experience during this pandemic the park was so clean and every person we met was careful and very helpful and special thanks to kenan cuz he was friendly very helpful and also thanks to other staff
Amazing theme park,"Had a fun night with friends. Show was really amazing and fun with rich content especially the show in the water and play of lights. This is a place where you don‚Äôt get bored even for a minute. It is so pleasant to have stroll around, watch the show which you‚Äôll feel compelled to make an Instagram live to show off to your list of friends. After the show, we had dinner at one of the restaurants and listened to live music from the neighbouring concert in the theme park. We had a really good time and endless selfies."
Great,Love the place lots of different things to do. Will definitely be back. Staff always helpful. Lots of sun
The land of legends,This place is really cool Kids are very happy to spend all day here!!!! Very clean here! The staff is also very good and polite
Definitely not a Rixos,"5 star hotel with soda extra in minibar.Such a shame for a Rixos family.I came here from Rixos premium belek but guess what, i did a terrible mistake by coming here. Forget about covid19 precautions and forget about social distance. Its a bazaar place in theme park.Stay away from this place.I will also write to Accor Hotels Loyalty club about the extra charge for the soft drinks at room."
Excellent Amusement Park!,We visited the land of legends with my friends during this covid-19 process. All the precautions have been taken in maximum point in the park. Honestly we enjoyed so much. Hyper coaster was perfect. It is real thrilling. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I liked it! I will come try again
Best water park in Europe,"This is definitely the best water park in Europe. It has lots of stuff for all ages and great food. The only thing is the lines are a bit long but that‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs a really nice place. Also it would be better if you stayed in the hotel, instead of just 1 day. Overall I totally recommend it"
Huge Fun kids property,"We visited this property as we were staying at rixos premium belek, they are partner properties and have frequent shuttle buses  between them,The property is massive with a grand entrance,The water park is very good and the shopping arcade is massive with lots of shops and food court,We would love to stay there next time, we spent a full day at land of legends kingdom and enjoyed lot of rides but most of the rides were either closed or being maintained as it is a low seasonLuvd it"
best place ever!!,the best place in Antalya. huge place with a ton of activities. never gonna be bored there. about 100 slides. the most exciting is the hypercoaster ride which is very fast!I will never forget that place
Theme park,Child friendly. Very good indoor childrens play area. Staff are very hospitable and kind. Would visit again.
Excellent experience and very fun for all!!,"So much to see and do, beautiful sights and unbelievable experiences. Some staff were miserable at times but not all"
Fantastic Theme Park,Good choice of food and rides for every age - would reccommend to everyone. Nice dolphin show and fast track is brilliant
Awesome,We visited that place last year we had very much fun every year more beautyfull the staffs are very kƒ±nd
ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿØŸÜ  ,A great place to have all the fun and nice games. The service here is great and fun. I advise all friends to come to Aqua Park
Good time,Had so much fun its a bit sad that aqua park is not available now but theme park was amazing especially the coasters staff was friendly smiling all the time
Wonderful ,Wonderful rest for children and adults . Very attentive personnel. good and tasty pizza. Even in spring good to visit
Holiday in winter,We are So happy recomended everyone for holiday so good place ride huricane very excitement especially MS Kadir friendly thanks everybody
Funny place,Everythink very good we are like for family and child so funny stay in cafe 7 g√ºlten every time smile ms hakan and mehmet helpfull and frirndly we are come back again see youuu
Fantastic day out,"Fantastic days out, we stayed at the hotel for a week and spent many days at the park. Kids loved every minute of it, they didn‚Äôt want to leave.We won a few prizes too"
Khurram Quddusi,"It's more than a theme park, and it's really amazing place for kids and adult, I really recommended for those who are planing to visit Turkey Antalya."
Fab stay!,Brilliant theme park! Attentive staff! We also swam with dolphins and fed the penguins. Can‚Äôt wait to travel back soon!
DO NOT VISIT THE AMUSEMENT PARK IF NOT STAYING AT THIS HOTEL,"I purchased 2 tickets for the land of legends on the morning of the 7th of November 2019 via the internet so avoid hassle when we arrived. However, when I showed the staff my confirmation of booking they refused to let us in because they hadn‚Äôt received the payment from my bank even though I there was visible proof which included the PNR code. They told me I would have to purchase the tickets again and asked for my bank information so when the money came through from my bank they would refund me. It has been 3 Months now and I haven‚Äôt received a refund although I have reached out many a times, the hotel has failed to respond. In total, I have paid $100 for two tickets which is ridiculous."
Dream land,"Great place , nice helpful stuff, suitable for all ages. Will definitely recommend it for everyone all time"
Park,It was a great place. Kind and friendly stuff. Lots of food and restaurants. Great opportunity for all family members
Nice,Very fun. Kids really enjoyed. Lots of activities. Very friendly staff. Stayed in the hotel. Worth to visit.
Mrs khouloud dakha,The park is wonderfull excellent for all ages ..everything you dreamed ofyou will find in there ..it is just a must !!
Not great for kids under 130cm tall,There are very few rides available for kids under 130cm which most rides are suitable for.  Just something to consider if you are going with younger children.  Our 3 yeas old was 100cm and desperate to go on the rides but he was just too small.  There was only a few other rides that he was able to go on given his height.We visited in April and less than half of the rides were open at this time of year
"Fantastic Place, theme park and shopping","all of the title, great shopping complex, you could be in Duabi, amazing, decoration for xmas was wonderful."
Amazing place,"Well worth a visit to this theme park.  It is very well laid out, lots of things to do for every age and good value for money.  Very clean and easy to find your way round.  Don't miss the sea life show, it's amazing.  You are given a wrist band on entry and you can load money onto it to use during the day for lockers, food etc any unused money is refunded at the end of your visit.Also, next to the Theme Park is a huge shopping mall that is free to enter and has lots of shops to suit every pocket and taste.  They also do daily shows along the main mall area and canal this is free from dance routines with fairy tale characters and music set to dancing fountains.  Well worth a visit."
Very nice stay,"The hotel rooms were very nice and had creative drawings on them, the staff were also really helpful and gave us and upgrade.The breakfast is really big and has a wide variery.Unfortunately due to the weather and the winter season many of the rides at the theme park were not working."
not recommended at all,very bad sevice unfriendly stuff very expensive food and drinks a stupid way to pay with chargable chip instead of money and uf you want your money back the give you only ib turish lera
Great park,Great way to spend the Christmas vacation.  This is our second visit to the land of legends and we will do it again ;)
Warm Vacation ,We enjoyed everything in the hotel Rooms are so comfortable and cleanFood was delicious and many choices and cuisine are availableStaff very cooperative and happy to assist with a big smile üòÄSpecially Dizdare (hope spelling correct) @ guest relation and Najla (Concierge desk)And the blonde girl from Ukraine (sorry not remember her name)To be honest all the staff are great The most attractive is the playstation in the kids room with projector The shopping Avenue and the Theme Park a place must be visited Salah Hidmi
Legends,It's a beatifull visit we will do it again very soon .. our children enjoy the park snd the dolphen show was amazing .. kind stuff .. thank you
Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel for the whole family I highly recommend I was in winter and all was open delicious and excellent food
Lovely park and staff ,"We visited the land of legends (dry park) in  this December with 3 children 13,11 and 6yrs old respectively, free entry as Rixos premium Belek guests!  First day was raining but we had dinner in the amazing and stylish Nemo restaurant excellent value for money and  high level of customer service. Staff have rain ponchos and umbrella to use during our visit and we were now to do in building activities. The next visits were dry with temp 18-21 degrees on various days. Park was lovely as no crowd no queues and the kids were able to  have multiple  go on rides. We did 80% on day 1 took about 4hrs. You get to buy videos(uploaded to your Samsung phone and pictures).  There is a small session for penguins as well.The dolphin show is actually in 3 parts: dolphins, walrus and beluga whales 3 shows covering 1hr!  Dolphin shows have been our staple in Spain but this show is on another level very classy and the animals are happy. The dry park still has a good number of rides and the typhoon coaster which ends in water so nice.There is food and drink around the park you buy this as no food allowed inside except water. Make sure you do the sky walker! Night show was out of the world  Christmas market, Santa ,elves,reindeers ,king and queen fireworks smoke effect bubbles in streets and glitter it was very Christmassy. And all day Christmas songs bellowed around the park from speakers, so we danced our way round actually. We will definitely be back again . This made our Christmas."
Mr,Land of the legends is a very clean and organized park.it is a great day out for the family.the dolphin show is also a must see.
Too many people! But great rides,The attractions are really good and interesting. But there were too many people waiting in lines. Spent more time waiting under the hot Sun. They have to fix that somehow.
Really they are the legends,Its the best theme park i have ever visited.the staff is very cooperative and always willing to help.good work
Such an amazing place,"I recently visited the Land of Legends with my husband and my 2 year old son. We had the most fantastic time and it is definitely a place to visit if you have children. It is a very child friendly place both for activities and decor. The staff were phenomenal-nothing was ever too much trouble. The night managers especially Mahir and Ali treated us like family, they took the time out to get to know us and really made us feel special. They constantly asked if we needed anything and we‚Äôre always happy to accommodate. We celebrated my husbands 40th and my sons 2nd birthday and the staff made both their days an exceptional celebration. Knowing that my son loved going up and down in a lift they even threw him a surprise party by decorating and cutting a cake in a lift! I can not highly recommend this place enough."
Brilliant theme park,"We visited in December, the park was lots of fun, our 5 year old thoroughly enjoyed all the rides and attractions.   The food is good, lots of options.  Staff all very friendly and helpful."
You must visit this place if you go to belek,quite expensive but a pleasure to walk round and visit very well designed and love the moat effect running through the town
Over-rated,Average. Do not visit with very high hopes. Food is not great. Limited outdoor activities for this season. Not very friendly staff at the fish restaurant in side the park.
Kids' heaven with great attention to details,"It is one of the rare examples that the facility, offerings, food and the staff far exceeded our expectations. The decoration is full of cute surprises all over the place starting from the entry where we are greeted with a candy stand, a reception area where kids can display their pictures on the giant screen behind the desk, amazing attention to all details in the rooms which includes child friendly non-cornered furniture, stands for the bathroom, kid size slippers, very comfortable beds... The park and the rides are suitable for a good age span. The night parade is one of the best we have seen. Very good value for money. The attention of the staff was amazing. With a sick 4 year old our special requests (such as diet food, clean linen) were handled promptly. Only suggestion we would have would be to put the air hockey and basketball arcade games somewhere secluded so the noise created is not heard all over the atrium and the elevator areas."
Great park with kids!!!,"Kids but also big machines for adults, swin suits not needed but preferred.  Chinease wall virtual reality show was amazing (almost too much, had to close eyes couple of times to not feel dizzy)."
Brilliant place for the right age - would love to come back when they're older,"We went with a 1 year old and a 2 year old so we're restricted for rides and as it was off season most of the water park was closed. However we did get to see the dolphin show which alone is worth 5 stars.There were a few rides we did get on and there are other activities suck as snorkeling, swimming with dolphins etc that you can do (8 years and above only)"
Lovely place!,"Really nice place to visit. The theme park is excellent, love the water rides. Just the whole surrounding of theme park is really nice and clean. Shopping, food courts, scenery, it has everything. They also hold live evening entertainment shows which is actually so so good, would definitely recommend a visit, especially with family."
Excellent,"Went here for a birthday treat for my son, day pass as couldn't afford to stay in the hotel.  We all really enjoyed the day, went on lots of water rides, by time we got through to the theme park area, there was a lot not operating but didn't deter from enjoying ourselves, went to the dolphine/whale/walrus show, kids loved it and pleased they are looked after, both my 2 will be saving up to come back to swim with them 1 day.  Came back in the evening to watch the boat show, really good atmosphere and we hope to come back very soon"
Many of the rides closed,Even though it was late in the season the weather was good about 25c. Many of the rides were closed and a lot of the staff looked bored etc. Not very welcoming. Food expensive so if travelling with a family load your band up.
one of the best theme parks we have been to,"a party of 8 of us went to this great park, sadly i was carrying an injury so couldn't enjoy it anywhere near as much as i would have liked, the coasters looked incredible and there were plenty of other rides there to keep everybody happy. the food was excellent and unlike most places you didn't get over charged, i'd love to go back when fully fit"
Ironman event,Amazing place. Very impressive design. The hotel is designed for staying in without need to be in other place for having fun making shopping and doing events. The only comment is that we pay the whole ticket for luna park but since most of amenities are with water and did not were operatives should be discounted.
fun day,very nice place to visit. its full of water games and amazing rides . lots of choices to eat and shows to see. the dolphins were beautiful specially the white ones.
Fantastic day out ,"We visited as a group of 8, 4 adults and kids aged 9, 10, 12 & 13 and there was something for everyone, we didn‚Äôt even manage to get round everything in a day!! It‚Äôs spotlessly clean and very well run with friendly staff, although we thought the life guards around the pool were a bit OTT wanting our 9&10 yr olds who can swim perfectly well to wear life jackets whilst we were sitting at the side, but I suppose you can look atIt another way saying they were just being cautious. The water ride staff were very strict too, weighing people to make sure they weren‚Äôt too heavy or light for the flumes which was reassuring.  Excellent value for money too, we paid ¬£75 for 3A & 1C.  Well worth a visit."
Great Day Out,"Land of Legends is a great theme park day out if you are in the area. A number of the 5 star properties enables you free admission.The theme park is vast with a great selection of rides, both white knuckle and others less frightening for some. It is well catered for children in terms of food and services.I also need to mention the politeness of the staff, they were a pleasure to deal with and can never do enough to help you. You have to visit if you are near the area or if your hotel provides you with free admission. Even if it doesn't, you should still go!"
Great family day out,"We went with family and also had a 10 year old and a 3.1/2 year old in the company. There was something for everyone. Pool , waterslides, rides for all ages. We were also surprised how reasonable the prices were as well. We were able to get on the rides and slides with not much time spent in queue. Went to the dolpharium as well and show was very good, We went back to the show at night and it is not to miss."
Am amazing place,The whole experience was amazing.the food and drinks excellent.all the staff couldn't do enough for you especially Walter in the restaurant.the theme park and aqua park excellent. The dolphinnshow a must see. The diving and swimming with the dolphins worth paying extra for
Amazing theme park,Wow absolutely amazing place.  You feel like you are in Vegas or Disneyland.  Lots of activities you can enjoy our just sit and relax in cafes and restaurants. The views become even better in the evenings.
The worst theme park ever,"It was really disappointing...every thing was very beautiful but the service was awful...we were there for a day we just could use four (just four) games...for each one we had to wait for 90 minutes which is not accepted with the amount of money we paid for tickets (after expensive tickets, fast track was not reasonable at all)i need to mention it was not even near the good quality we had experienced in Sunway lagoon or in Dubai or even in Adaland!"
Fab water park and theme park,Great place to visit with teenagers plenty to keep them all entertained lots of water slides and roller coasters only down side is all inclusive is not all inclusive only limited drinks no ice creams and only limited snack bars included in the package. Would definitely return but probably stay again different hotel and visit for day.
Worst Water Park in Europe ,"Built on greed. Stayed in the hotel. Though it looks out of this world in pictures and that it will rival any Dubai hotels is a wonder you see when booking. Upon arrival looks impressive. Food is good but repeats every day nothing like the Delphin hotels in Lara beach. The outdoor pools waters are freezing so couldn‚Äôt go in and enjoy with the kids which is a great shame. They rip you off though all inclusive some food stations charge you some don‚Äôt, ice creams all charged in any Lara hotel we have been too they don‚Äôt. They take drinks off you on entrance while even in Euro Disney or Disney world USA they don‚Äôt. Songs are very irritating all popular songs replaced with Land of Legends. Rooms are average nothing special. For the price there a much better hotels out there. It‚Äôs your money I would look elsewhere for sure as I would never ever go back!"
Good place,I visited Land of Legends aqua park and theme park and I was impressed by the slides and attractions
‚òÄÔ∏è,Some units doesnt work we have waited all day long and it wasnt working still on the orher hand staff is helpful and food is fine
29.10.2019,It was so exiting abd enjoyable specialy for my dogther who is 10.l recomend it strongly.tee negative point was the price of every thing hear which was so so expensive
very amusing park,"it was a nice park. lots of things to do and rides to enjoy. the water slides were very nice too specially the lazy river and the pool. but everything inside is sooo expensive,so be prepared."
"Everything was nice but the sea animal show should be cancelled, as of today Tripadvisor will not support this anymore..","Everything was nice but the sea animal show should be cancelled, as of today Tripadvisor will not support this anymore.."
Fun day out for all the family,"Felt the need to review as quite a few negative comments about this place. All aqua parks the world over are the same. Height restrictions and lots of rules. My two kids are 9 and 7 and 134cm and 121cm tall. You need to be 120cm to qualify for most of the aqua park decent rides and 130cm to qualify for most of the coasters in the theme park. If you are staying in belek on an all inclusive where your hotel already has a few water slides and your kids are shorter than 120cm, then I‚Äôm not sure this is the place for you, especially after you‚Äôve been mugged off by the local taxi cartel.Land of legends is a great family day out, it‚Äôs clean, organised, new and large enough to cope with being busy. It‚Äôs like a Turkish version of a mini Disney world. Food is ok, changing facilities are ok. Clever lockers. Decent security checks on way in/out. Most of the staff spoke enough English to get by (a lot better than my Turkish!)Dolphin / animal show is worth watching and it feels like the animals are well looked after.The hyper coaster is worth the entrance fee alone. My 9year old absolutely loved it.The only reason why I haven‚Äôt given this 5 stars is because they insist on blaring out loud music and tannoy announcements all the time, I‚Äôm a bit deaf so found this very annoying.Enjoy."
Wow amazing day out !! ,We arrived 9.40am. Staff at the check were a bit miserable and didn‚Äôt smile but after that the day went well and it was brilliant! We started at the changing area and then went to the 11.30 dolphin show which was good. The 10 min interval was annoying saw the kids starting getting ratty so we left and don‚Äôt stay on but I heard it was white dolphins after the interval.We went to the water park which was great the slides are good and it was quiet so a great time to visit and good weather. We ate lunch at the al la carte wasn‚Äôt bad prices. The 5D cinema you get wet so defo go in swimwear we made the mistake and got changed before we went in!Defo try the Nemo restaurant eating with fishes swimming around fabulous. We had dinner there and Watched the 9pm show which was ok but a lot of walking from Imen place to another trying to follow it!Overall a fabulous day.
Mediocre,"We were looking forward to staying at this 5* hotel expecting 5* service and facilities I will list pros and cons to make this Review easier.Pros - hotel is very grand/ clean- service is quite quick- facilities for kids are very good- staff friendly with kids- kids activities extensive- catered to mines and children allergies ( very big pro )- rooms are nice for children- outside hotel area there is a lovely shopping complex and cafes.Cons- I was expecting a hotel only pool only to find its part of the water park which everyone is accessing as nobody is even there to check who is using the pools. Leading to no beds being available.- in water park there are TWO towel areas. This means you are walking across 5-10 minutes to get towels which you have to lay out yourself ( something in a 5* resort you do not really do).- hotel buffet is awful it‚Äôs very basic. I was expecting more variety different cuisines such as Japanese.- lunch is a la carte not buffet only pizza burgers fried food. For those wanting a healthier choice you have to pay for grilled food. - The edging in the shower  is all black and full of mould in  ( will post a pic)- rooms have stains on walls and carpet- we changed room due to this. - the pools are absolutely freezing, to the point I have pain entering the water ( seriously no exaggeration). Kids refuse to swim.- Overall sadly would not return. I think if I paid less I would expect less. But we paid a little less than a holiday to Dubai. So was expecting high standards. If you are regulars to the Middle East do not expect this hotel to meet those standards- there is no comparison."
A place to visit.,"No matter where you are in Antalya, visit this place. Best spend all day with the fun that awaits you.There is fun for every taste."
Crazy rides of international standards,Must visit if you are going to Antalya. You can easily spend an entire day here. They have a huge retail shopping section connected with the park which has multiple eating options as well. They have built a mini castle and venice as well within the property which looks beautifiul.
Awesome ,One of the very nice and fun places in the whole area. Maybe you need more than one day to visit this nice place. The water park is very nice with lots of fun rides. There is a shopping area for those who enjoy shopping.Rest rooms and chanving room are very clean and nice.I suggest to buy fast entry tickets in high season periods.
Awesome,This place is amazing. Its really good for age groups. Food and drinks within the park is really good. We were totally amazed at this place as it has something for everyone. Would highly recommend this place and will be sure to return.
The worst water park on the planet,This place looks amazing and should be good first they take cans of pop off you at the gate out of your bag purely for money reasons so you have to buy theres pure greed the ones I have been to in Cyprus Florida Spain would never and have never done this The food and drink are over priced and the fast track is a joke about ¬£40 if you don't get it  which you must get because otherwise you are waiting even in October for 45 mins for a slide  no cash machine and they will not take euros I have not one positive thing to say about this water park from top to bottom it's the worst park in the worldIt's built Purley on greed money money money even the music is popular music with the main words replaced with land of legends in every song
Absolutely breathtaking,I am in absolute awe of this place! We have visited as a family with two young children age 3 and 8 from the UK. The hotel alone is unbelievable. It has everything you could ask for as a family. We were lucky enough to have a room with balcony overlooking the castle. It was truly magical. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. It was spotless and nothing is too much trouble. Everywhere you look there is something for the children to do of all ages. The spa is fantastic also and worth a visit. They also provide a free bus shuttle service to the sister hotel (Rixos Premium Beach) which is paradise. We will for sure be returning again and most likely to book next year once we come home. I have previously been to Florida and I can honestly say this is on par if not better. I cannot recommend enough.
Humiliated,"Me and my partners family visited this theme park/water park yesterday and was thoroughly disappointed. Firstly we did not feel very welcomed we just got handed a peice of paper with a map on and had to try and work the park out for ourselves which was fine. When we got to our first water ride we wanted to go on my partner weighed himself as he saw the scales at the front of the line and was 7kg off of the weight limit. Me and my nephew continued to que as we are obviously alot smaller than my partner and then assumed they would not need to weigh us, how wrong we were. When we got to the front of the qu√© I was directed to the scales in front of a huge crowed may I add, I refused to get on the scales and argued with the life guard that obviously they just saw my strapping 6ft 3 20+ stone partner get turned away being 7kg over the limit obviously I'm no where near the limit. This life guard did not understand obviously he dident pay attention in math class. Also they were picking and choosing who had to stand on the scales so basically if you look fat you had to stand on them I felt totally discriminated against and very humilated and got ended up not being able to go on the ride. Sorry won't even make up for what I felt at your theme park and it will be a memory that will now haunt me forever I have a real issue with my weight and this could of been resolved so easily. I will not be visiting your park if I ever return to turkey (unlikely) and if my friends ever choose to visit I will make sure they do not visit your horrible park."
Mr qaisar ashraf,We had a great time kids enjoyed the hotel great hospitality from mahir he was superb we sure will be coming back
What an amazing experience,"We are currently staying at the Land of the Legends Kingdom hotel. We have a great experience from both the facilities that the hotel provides, especially the water park which is amazing!!, and the service of the staff."
Great adventure,We had the best time!! Best park! Super clean super fun! We had a realy great time!We will come back for sure.
Land of legends holiday ,Having fun at land of legends with family and friends. Lots to do for the kids and adults and great service
Family holiday,Staying at the kingdom hotel with 2 adults 2 children. Amazing from start to finish. So much to do for all ages. Hotel clean and food is amazing best holiday ever. Will be returning next year. Sad to be leaving tomorrow. Mehmet Surneli is my favourite all staff are welcoming and helpful.
"Beyond expectations, but expensive","A really nice theme park... We went at the end of September, so luckily not much crowded. The slides, pools, and all the other activities are really fun and high-tech. I do admit that the park, in general, was really beyond my expectations. At some point I found myself comparing it with the theme park in Dubai. Overall it was a fine experience. Especially in terms of weather and the crowd. As far as I read from the other reviews, everyone was complaining about the lines, which I did not come across much. But it is quite expensive :( The food, lockers, other stuff... Could be perfect with a little lower price range!"
Beautiful place,"The Land of Legends theme park is perfect place for family with children. I also recommend that you go to the 10pm evening show, which is free and very attractive."
WONDERFUL HOLIDAY,Amazing place for family !!!Everything in one place with so many things to do !!!Very friendly staff keeping everything on the topAll 5 stars !!!! Very recommended Great value for money
Had the best time.  ,"This place is so much fun, the queues were short, loved all the rides.  The staff very friendly.  Only issue as always with all my trips is that I'm a pescatarian and food is a real problem."
Land of the Legends,Lovely place to get thrills. Long lines tho even with fast track. Lots of places to eat at. The shoppin mall is lovely at night and so is the ice cream. Good day at the theme park
Fun Filled,Excellent to spend a day. We had complementary access from Rixos Premium Belek and went to spend a day at the water and theme park as well as watch the night boat parade. The boat parade was spectacular and unique.
Great team park and water park,"This team park is one of the best in Europe!!! They have some of the newest water fallsFrom surfing pool, to space cube, dolphins  show wave pool and many water falls that fit to adults and to small kidsTo have the best deal to this park - order full  meals in the kingdom hotel and ask also for fast trackVery recommend!!"
One of the most fun activities to do in Antalya,"My friend and I had a super amazing time visiting this park, that has a waterpark, theme park and shopping mall. It truly is magical. The water slides had special lighting effects and there was a great variety of water activities for thrill seekers and chill seekers alike. The shopping mall had nightly performances, a variety of restaurants to dine at, and luxury stores as well as a few mid-range ones. A must go."
Wow,"We stayed in a hotel in belek, purchased our tickets from our rep. We got a taxi to land of Legends for 90lira (15mins) the park is ace, plenty to do mainly water park with a couple of big rollercoasters and other rides. Good for all ages. Topped the wristband up with money in the park and used for food and drink. The cold mists of water through the park are Brill and keep you cool. All staff speak very good English and this was great for us! At ¬£60 for 2 adults (English) it was a great price."
We loved it!!! ,"Our girl was only 6 months but we loved it. The show with dolphins was AMAZING! We stayed at the rixos hotel so had free entry and honesty,it would be worth paying for tickets even if we didnt!"
Nice place especially for families with children,"Hello. Before taking this trip to Land of Legends I‚Äôve read lots of reviews here in Tripadvisor and I would now like to share with you my impressions. I have stayed in the hotel for one week with my 4 years old child.First of all I will start with the small things that botherd me. Here in Germany most of the tours opperators sell this hotel with the all inclusive opption ( we had ultra all inclusive) but noboday tells you what to expect, its so different from the all inclusive tou had before. The hotel explains you that all inclusive here it‚Äôs different( they call it all inclusive concept) and it goes like this- breakfast and dinner buffet style, lots of good food you can choose from but for lunch you can eather have it in the hotel a la carte or in the aqua park and here comes the problem. They have some restaurant in the aqua park where you can eat but not everything you see there its included in the price. I can fully understand that local beverages are included and alchoholl imported its not BUT we had an incident with a DONUT, it never crossed my mind that if you see a donut and a tiramisu in the frige if you choose the donut you have to pay and the tiramisu was included( this was in the Fast and good restaurant). For me this was mindblowing, we are talking about a donut not caviar and if the management politic its to get more money from the clients with triks like this then its kinnda f...ed up( we have payed 2700 Euros, 2 adults and one child for flights and accomodation), just think about it Land of Legends, how many donuts can one eat in one week!? We asked in the same restaurant if the lollypop was for free and it wasnt and I am talking about the same tipe of lollypop that they offer for free in the hotels lobby. So yes, this beeing said they really have to work on this all inclusive concept so one does not feel cheated after paying lots of money, its the small things that make the difference between a perfect hollyday and a not that great one.Now to the good part of my review! The rooms are absolutlly briliant decorated, big, clean, comfortable, they change sheets every day, the toiletrees are good, nice branded, the bed is very confy and again so clean, the cleaning ladys are working very hard there. The Eternia Restaurant is nice, the food very good, people working there are nice and friendlly, I forgot my purse on one of the chairs and one hour later I‚Äôve found it at guest relations.The childrens club its perfect for small children, they have acctivites all day long, they give you the program with the activities you can choose from, my daughter really enjoyed it, the young peoole working here are friendlly and commited.The aquapark and the dry park its spotless clean! At the pools the lifeguards are working hard to take care of the chlidren, we felt save to leave our child explore the whaterslides alone so I give a big thumbs up for the lifeguards not bending the rules!About the night show now. It‚Äôs like a fairy tale!!! So beautiful, so much hard work, the costumes, the music...everything its perfect! And its not true that they have the sane show every night, there are different variatiins of the show and we didnt got bored with it in one week. Big thumbs up for they boys and girls from the show, they are really in caracter like real actors. All this beeing said we will be staying again in this hotel when they improve the all inclusive concept!"
Awesome ,"The new Disney world of MEA. Sublime place for children and adults, water attractions are wow and Russian mountains were with high sensations. Great variation of coffee shops, restaurants and boutiques. The free night show on the walking parade is beautiful."
Land of Legends,"Everything was fine, we had a great time, a lot of kids atractions.The weather was perfect, the water was a little bit cold but we had a great time."
Water rides were the best,"A very enjoyable experience for all and very family friendly. They even have a food court with a huge selection! Although their mosque is quite far from the main attraction, it's still worth it and right near the food court.  Amusement park has an aqua park and a dry park. I would suggest going to the aquapark first, so you have enough time to dry off."
Amazing park,Nice pool and roller coasters! Great place to spend your time and have fun with your family and friends! Maria was really nice and helpfull!Nice rides and activities !!
Great Day Out!,"Went here as a party of 13 adults in early September.  It is a beautiful looking park, we got there literally as it opened and went on as many rides as we could before it got too busy.  The queuing system for rides is a bit confusing as my kids joined a queue for one ride and ended up on a totally different one :) By lunchtime the place was heaving and the queues were huge, so went over to the dry part of the park, less rides, but a fair selection.  One of the big ones wasn't working the day we were there so slightly disappointing.  The dolphin show was nothing special, so unless you have little kids that haven't seen one of these shows before, I wouldn't bother and would spend the time going on the rides while most of the park is at the show. The floors underfoot were really rough, even going up the stairs to the rides.  I do understand that they have to be made of a non-slip surface and not one that attracts the heat too much, but I saw so many people limping towards the end of the day!  If you have the type of beach shoes that you can wear on slides, then take them!The food areas were good, compared to other water parks we have been to and the food was of a really good quality and very reasonably priced. You have to put money on your wrist when you arrive to be able to pay for anything during the day, we thought this would be a real pain, but it was fine.  You can add money onto your wrist at any of the food outlets.  Also lockers just need a euro coin and they are placed beside your sunbeds, so really easy to get stuff in and out when you need it, rather than at a bank of lockers which other places have. The shopping and restaurant area is located just outside of the theme park, really beautiful, with amazing shops, but very very expensive, all high end designer shops.  We didn't stay for the show at 10pm as it works out a very long day, but would like to go back another time to just see this, as this part of land of legends is free entry. Would I go back? Probably, as its nice to get out of your hotel, but it doesn't compare to the Disney parks or to the Siam Park in Tenerife."
Not like Disney.,Very big and mainly a water park. No standard swimming pool. Left a good pair of shoes behind. Went back next day and not found by staff.  Suspect someone in Turkey now wearing them.
Fast track was worth it,"We visited the water park on a Tuesday. You will get a wristband when you arrive - and first thing you should do is go to guest relations and get your wristband topped up with money. You can purchase in GBP, Lira, EUR, USD etc. The wristband is then used to pay for lockers and all food and drink. You will get any unspent cash back in Lira at the end of the day, by visiting guest relations again. We put our flip flops in the locker and walked barefoot, but some of the paths are really painful to walk on! I would suggest keeping shoes with you, as there is always somewhere to leave them at the bottom of the rides. However, some of the paths from there up to the slides are still really painful!!!We were in the park and over to the first ride by about 11:15 (opened at 10) and we had to queue a good 30/40 mins to get on. We saw that you could get fast track passes, so once we had gone on the ride, we went back to guest relations and bought fast passes. They were 200lira / ¬£30 each. We figured that we had already spent the money to be there, so rather spend the extra to ensure we got the most out of our day. There tends to be one staircase and multiple rides at the top of each. At one of the staircases - we managed to get up and down all 4 slides in about 30 mins with fast track, whereas the normal wait for one slide was 45 mins. There was no way we would have gotten on every ride while we were there without the fast pass. Queuing was a bit pandemonium also. Hundred odd people queuing to get up the stairs, yet when you got to the top, some of the 4/5 slides had nobody waiting - but there was no telling of any of the people at the bottom of the stairs were waiting for that ride. This could be done much more efficiently to get more people through. Also, getting people on the float ready for the slide wasn‚Äôt always the quickest either. With massive queue like that, I felt they should be getting people in the float ready to go as soon as the light turned green - not waiting for light to go green, then spend a couple minutes getting people in and ready. Really inefficient at times. However, may be a safety thing as they were always checking height and weight before getting in rides. We for changed and went to the roller coaster park after, although lots of people were there in the same ‚Äòwet‚Äô clothes from water park, so we didn‚Äôt have to change. There were no queues at the dry park at all - although the fast pass did allow us to get on first to the rides meaning we could sit at the front etc.  The hyper coaster was amazing!!!!I would probably advise to bring sun scream with you round the park also, leaving it at the bottom of the rides with the shoes. Some rides we were waiting in direct sun!All in all, a good day out. We definitely needed the fast pass on the day we went, and would have preferred to have shoes on as the paths are super painful!!!"
Marvelous moments for legendary holiday,"First of all I would like to say this park one of the best off his kind, I spent very marvelous time there. Dry park was very awesome both stuffs and devices. Cool coosters around which is typhoon and hyper,guys trust me you sould try that, thank me later. I want to give credits for mr hakan and volkan once I lost my bag in dry park which has very Important work files in there,this guys help my case immediately and solve the problem thank you mates Hell of a job this guys save me to get fired:)))"
Land of Legends Theme Park ,"I visited the Land of Legends theme park with my wife & 4 year old.There is a minimum height restriction in place meaning any child under 120cm can only go on a couple of rides.The park is set up for older children, which was  a little disappointing. Rules are in place for safety, we should have checked this out before we visited.The best Rollercoaster in the park is the Hyper coaster which is a high adrenaline ride. I managed to get on it 3 times during our visit.The park was clean & tidy. Food & drink prices were surprisingly acceptable, considering it‚Äôs a captive audience."
Horrible organisation,"Disappointment about aquapark !!!! Before I been visited 5 diffrent aquaparks in diffrent countries. LAND OF LEGENDS my tour guide in the Hotel Alara Star 5 from Anex Katerina, wich I already complain about sold for us on 03.09.2019 and it was our worst experience ever!!!First impression from the gate is amassing, everything looks fantastic. A lot of diffrent locations, trees, plants, fountains, constructions, fun zones... You just feel like you are inside of fairy tail. BUT ALL THIS JUST IMPRESSION!!!!! This is aquapark and the main reason to go there it's Water slides, BUT the system of passing on the slides have been builded with maximum saving of space...as a result only one tower with a steps on 8 slides!!!! Waiting time to get upstairs was 50 to 60 min on each slide. When people were reaching starting point were get SHOCKED becouse actually only 3 out of 8 busy, the rest is empty on the top, but down huge line of pertisipens. Before this place I've never seen such a bad system. Steps tower must be provided for maximum 3 water slides, not for 8. For 7 hours I've been able to use 4 slides only!!! At least if our Tour guide from Anex advise us about troubles with passing we could buy FAST PASS and enjoy our day. But she didn't say anything and we simply took money for lunch only. It was the worst day!!!And cherry on top of the cake was faces of¬† staff in this park!!! All of them looks upset, not happy and moving like they are giving a favor to us!!!! For 7 hours in this place smile show up only in Dolphin show during performance.Never ever again my leg will step on this Hell of Legend Again! Also never will use Anex tour!!! I will leave this comment in all internet resorses in English, in Russian and even in Turkish languages!!!!"
Great theme park - check if you need a fast pass before buying,"Went to Land of Legends as part of the Rixos Sungate and had a great day. My only comments are:- check whether you need a fast past and don‚Äôt believe all the ‚Äú1 review‚Äù comments from a few days ago that say you do (marketing bots?). When we went it was quiet and fast passes were not needed. In our experience, when there was a bigger queue, especially on some of the water rides, they let about 10 fast passers through, not everyone in that queue, then 30 non fast passes which was annoying for anyone who had paid extra. - do not get a fast pass for anyone just under the minimum height! The sales people are obviously on commission and will sell as many as they can including for children just under the height restrictions. They are checked at every ride and are refused. Getting a refund was difficult but we got there in the end.- the ride operators are very strict about minimum height and maximum/minimum weight. All of the water slides have weighing scales next to them and you have to get on them in front of a staff member. Great H&S but slightly rough on the ego!- eat at the restaurant as you cross into the water park (I can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name). The table service was really good and the food delicious. Completely unexpected but we were all impressed.- some of the walkways to the water rides are very sharp on the feet and made walking painful. Perhaps it was the end of the season but LoL need to do something urgently.Unlike a previous reviewer, we thought the park was pretty reasonably priced. But then we had Turkish Lira so perhaps this made a difference."
Armband refund,Please do not make a big top on your armband i seem to be having problems to get the refund back when you see the amount of people in the park but you have to wait weeks to get your money back be warned guys
Great family time,We have had so much fun. Our little girl (4.5 years old) loved it! Family roller coasters were just perfect for whole family. We would recommend it for families üòÄ
50th birthday,Can people swim with the dolphins as well as feed them ..just asking before i get there in november ..wanting an experience i will never forget for my 50th
Good but not great,"The day spent at the Land of Legends theme park and overall experience was pretty average compared to other theme parks experienced.We paid extra for the fast passes which although expensive, glad we did otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have done half the rides in the water park. The Magicone was different and the wave area was good but got very crowded in the water at times and if you did not go there first thing to get a lounger, then after lunch there were none available and nowhere to leave shoes/hats etc close by. As others have mentioned, walking to some of the rides was painful as the surface had broken up.Unfortunately I got thrown off a raft on the Starship water slide half way down and hurt my shoulder/neck towards the end of the day which meant I couldn‚Äôt do the coasters but others said the Hyper Coaster was as good as Florida ones (which was annoying for me).The staff were pleasant, the resort clean and the food was good at a very fare price for a theme park. Once I was able to find the right place to report my injury (a number of customer service centres were unattended), they quickly got first aid to administer some treatment, (although was in discomfort for a couple of weeks), but it did mean we couldn‚Äôt visit the rest of the resort/shopping.If looking for a break from lounging around a pool for a day of activity at a price then it is worth a visit,"
Absolutely Brilliant place,"Fantastic place for all the family, water park very good and the theme park is excellent for all ages. Night time shopping is good and brilliant shows. Will be going again"
Great Family Advanture,"It was great adventure .. everything nice , clean , new , fun games.... but to be honest its an expensive place  ... but i do highly recommended especially if you have kids & teenagers.... unforgettable adventure for all of us. Good for all the family members."
Land of Let down‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,"Visited here for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as part of a holiday staying at the Rixos Sungate. I have to evaluate this the way I experienced it, so that others reading may understand what they will go through.If you are at the Rixos Sungate ‚Äì they will pick you up at 9.30am in one of seven buses ‚Äì its mayhem trying to get onto one of these buses and they cram you in like sardines, the air con doesn‚Äôt work very well and you end up in traffic due to the time they leave.We arrived (exited the bus) at 11:30am ‚Äì we were given our wristbands and told that the buses back left at 4:45pm‚Ä¶.we got through the gate, exchanged money onto the wrist band (we aware that the exchange rate is utter trash ‚Äì I lost about ¬£12 by converting Euro into Turkish Lira and put onto the wristband and then when we left they paid out in Turkish Lira not Euro) ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to put Turkish Lira on the wristband, hired a locker (that you can return to as many times as you want during the day) for around ¬£6 by the time we had finished that we got one ‚Äúgo‚Äù in the wave pool and then it was lunchtime‚Ä¶.unfortunately we went to probably the worst fast food place in the park ‚Äì over by the ‚Äúfountains‚Äù ‚Äì you want to go to the restaurant in the middle of the lazy river ‚Äì the food looked much better there. Having finished that we went to the kids play area ‚Äì this was so busy that we had to keep an eye on the littlest one at all times, lots of pushing and shoving by other bigger kids but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice area as its covered by a big tarp to keep the area in the shade for the little ones.After an hour of this I decided to go on one of the rides on my own as the kids are too small ‚Äì the one where they shut you in a capsule and the floor drops out underneath you as I have never done one of these before and wanted to experience something for the first time‚Ä¶..40 minutes queing later I am 6th from the front of the queue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they shut the ride stating technical difficulties‚Ä¶.‚Äùwhat do I do?‚Äù I ask ‚Äì lifeguard shrugs and says ‚Äúgo on the one at the top‚Äù ‚Äì this was a simple straight down slide ‚Äì 3 seconds tops‚Ä¶..i finished that, checked the time and it was nearly 3pm‚Ä¶.i thought I can‚Äôt queue up for another one as the queues looked to have grown‚Ä¶.so went back ‚Äì had 1 more go in the wave pool with everyone and a bit of a splash‚Ä¶.then it was 4pm, time to go get dried off, ready, change the money back and we were back on the bus at 4.30pm for the 1.5 hour drive back ‚Äì total waste of a day.In summary I went on 1 ride, spent 3.5 hours in a bus and spent ¬£75 on not a lot of food/drink/locker on a free trip. The queues are beyond ridiculous ‚Äì even the fast track ticket only gets you to the front of one queue at the bottom of the steps, you will still have to queue at the top by the actual slide entrance ‚Äì this was 20 minutes itself. You won‚Äôt get a bed to put your stuff on unless you are early or are lucky either.This place is very well kept and looked after and has a very upmarket feeling and I think if you could stay say 1 hour after the others have left or be there for opening this would be worth it as you would get some time on some slides but as it is I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone especially if you were staying at the Rixos Sungate and travelling in.I didn‚Äôt even have time to get to the roller coaster part of the park ‚Äì some other families said they managed to get on the roller coasters and the park was empty as everyone was at the water park.If you go ‚Äì make sure you get there as early as possible(go in a taxi), get yourself a sunbed to dump your stuff on, don't take ANYTHING valuable so you can just leave it on the sunbed, change your Turkish Lira onto the wristband as soon as you get in, buy fast-track and just go go go ‚Äì that way you will get on the rides and enjoy the park ‚Äì there is a lot to enjoy, but it‚Äôs just not the chilled out experience it should be."
Great theme park for families.,The aqua park was exciting and nice rides lots of activities to keep yourself and your family busy. A bit expensive and the food halls are super expensive be careful when loading your wristbands with money. You won‚Äôt carry money as you will be wet after the rides so make sure you have enough money for food and drink in the park.
big like,"I like it very much but the stuff from delphinarium disapointed me. They told me a price for dolphin , after 2 hours, told me another price. Big dissaponted for this."
Great park,The park is really great and cool.It's very fun here and very beautyful.we are goin to visit again with friendsü•∞
John,"Wow!  This is a Water Park, a Theme Park and a Shopping Centre all in one.  The shops sell high quality , genuineness at reasonable prices."
"""",I been there a few days and spend nice time in that hotel. There are many options for rest and entertainment. Good hotel for family
Amazing adventure,Me and my family are here for second time. It‚Äôs amazing and real fun adventure. The staff is kind and every thing is nice :)
A great place,We loved the place my kid enjoyed alot although its expensive but the experience is great you can enjoy water activities till 6 pm and after can have fun in rides. Would love to visit again.
great visit,Absolutely fantastic place with a lot of fun. I recommend this to everyone who comes to belek. U must visit this place!
family holiday,"We were staying approx 1 mile from this water park. Visited twice during our holiday. Second time we purchased Fast Track passes for our two children. Without these, you are looking at approx 45 mins to an hour. Ticket price approx ¬£60.00 ea, so works out an expensive day out on top of ¬£45/¬£50 entrance fee. Apart from this, it was not packed out. Everything is purchased through a wrist band which you put money on. Refund of balance at end of the day, not a problem. We found this to be a good day out, about 7 hours was enough for the four of us. ."
Great Park,This is Great water park and you will like it as my children liked it very much and there are superb rides in this park I suggest you take the fast pass when u go in rush period thats what i did for my kids and they could go on all the rides also as we stayed in Rixos hotel the entry  pass to this park was for free
Great day out if your in Turkey!!,Well what can I say!! This place is amazing üòâ we had such a wicked time. It‚Äôs got things for everyone to do & see from the ages of 3-99. The food here is good value for money & the rides are to die for! If you like swimming & you like rollercoasters then this is the place for you. Just remember to take your flip flops or sliders cos the floor is gritty & boiling hot ü•µ other than that it‚Äôs the best water park in Antalya Turkey üáπüá∑
Wife‚Äôs birthday,"Wow wow wow  this place was amazing nothing like we thought it was going to be at all. The aqua park was brilliant so much to do and have so much fun slide after slide of laughter we totally loved it then there was the 3 shows dolphin, walrus and beluga whale shows and all 3 were great fun. and then over the other side was the theme park with roller coasters and rides and a 5d cinema to have even more fun We had a great day at Land of Legends and will be coming back."
Land of robbers,"We made the biggest mistake during our holiday to Antalya to visit the land of legends. You pay do much money to get in. Once inside everything is extremely expensive and they make you pay for lots of things to use , expect to add another ¬£100 minimum inside. The place is not shaded with enough trees so it's boiling hot. Time wasting,Keep away!"
Nothing Special ... and everything Ultra Expensive !,"Are You in Belek or in Antalya ?Well ... the  for sure your Guide will propose you to go to this place !It is a sort of Big Turkish Luna Park mixed with Universal Studios and Disney World ... but ... it is NOT comparable with the Professionalism of the American Parks !If you do NOT go, from my point of view, you do NOT lose too much and , most of all , you do NOT lose Money as the Park is terribly expensive !An example ? 2 muffins, 1 Cappuccino and 1 American Coffee with 1 Orange Juice : 60 Euro !Come On ... with All my respect : Antalya is NOT MONTECARLO !!!"
Ok although glad we got it as part of hotel stay,"The best part of our visit to The Land Of Legends was the dolphin show, this was truly amazing.  Other than that the park was ok.  The lifeguards love their whistles but are not helpful when you need them.  The idea of putting money on to wristbands to pay for everything was ok after our second visit but not helpful on the first when you are trying to work things out.  The wave pool was good but couldn‚Äôt go in any of the pools with T-shirt‚Äôs on which wasn‚Äôt good when trying to protect children‚Äôs shoulders from the sun.  We had a great day out but wouldn‚Äôt rush to visit again."
Amazing water park plus theme park ,"We visited last week and loved it, it is expensive but when you think you are getting Alton Towers , Blackpool Pleasure Beach and a brand spanking new water park - it‚Äôs a bargain The water park was great really good slides - we went about 3pm and it wasn‚Äôt too bad to queue about 20 mins - any earlier and it can be an hour We left the water park got changed (great Facilities) and wandered around the shopping zone until about 7.30 pm then crammed in the roller coasters- quickest I‚Äôve-been on even quicker than OrlandoWe stayed for the light show which is great but a bit odd if you don‚Äôt get the man running round in a dinner suit !The guest relations are fantastic , one of them even rang our taxi to change pick up time on his own phone - brilliant"
An amazing theme Park,"Hello folks, the theme park is a must-do at Antalya, the attractions are very good, the service is very good, the park is clean, well managed, the roller coasters are fun and some are extreme. We are a couple who loves theme parks with extreme attractions and believe me there is a blue roller coaster that is just incredible. Last advice when you buy the ticket which is around 35 $ you can access it to the water park also.  Last but not least, the price after 2 o'clock entry is cheaper than before 2.Enjoy folks"
don't go if anyone in you party has a medical condition,"me, my wife and the two kids went to this park my two children both have medical conditions ,we had proof for my daughters but not for my son ,we went into the customer services to get a medical pass so they didnt have to stand long in the high temp,the manager said he would give a pass for my daughter but not for anyone else ,we explained that other water/theme parks give them for all the family  as we are there carers and if they need medical attention we would know what to do ,but the manager would'nt still give us all a pass so we walked out .this park is an amazing concept and no exspence has been spared to build this but our experience was spoilt and my children we put in jeopardy .so dont go if someone in your party has a medical condition (don't go they don't care)."
Nice day out,"Myself and my 14 year old daughter took a taxi from our hotel to Land of legends theme park and our first impressions on pulling up outside were very impressive. We pre booked our tickets with fast track passes and handed our printout into the ticket office where although it said we had paid for the fast track there seemed to be some confusion on whether we had it or not. Eventually after some discussion amongst the staff and some phone calls we were given our fast track wrist bands. Next we had to go through security where they check your bags which is a very comforting occurrence. However, we brought some cans of pop from our hotel and these were taken from us, when we asked why, they said it was because they sell it in the park. You are aloud to take water in. I always carry a small Swiss Army knife with me and was meant to leave it at the hotel but for some reason left it in my back pack. The security guards were so consumed with taking our cans from us that they totally missed the pen knife that was in the same part of the bag as the cans in plain view. So knives are aloud but fizzy drinks aren‚Äôt. Once into the park, it was very easy to load our wrist bands with money and then off loading all our stuff into lockers which you pay for with your band and then you can access them as often as you want all day. The park is immaculate, spotlessly clean. We wanted to go on the dry rides first but these don‚Äôt open until an hour after the park gates so we went on some wet rides. First thing there are virtually no queues but as the day went on the queues were huge and we were thankful for the fast track. We were riding 4 slides and still seeing the same people waiting in queue for their first ride. The floor of the park including the paths to the slides is covered in really sharp stones and when you are walking up to the slides bare footed it literally feels like it is ripping the soles of your feet off. The park is big but not massive and we felt that the cost is quite high for what you get in comparison to other theme parks around the world."
Fabulous day out,One of the best theme parks i have been to.  We have been coming here since it opened and we all love it.
Aqua park ,"We have been to many wanter parks, but this one was special, we booked a private cabana which came with amazing service and food served all day while we went to the various rides. The dolphin show was spectacular and I would highly recommend this venue as a must see while in Antalya. The Cabana is expensive but well worth it..."
Nice facilities but very poor service and staff,"Absolutley appauled at the very poor service we recieved. If your a Russian then you are ok, the rest can forget it. The staff are very pathetic with poor attitude and I definately wont be returning here. Go to Rixos Premium if you want a friendly service. In Land of legends they will try and charge you for using the toilet if they could and the food was like it was from the night before. Our rooms were not cleaned properly and we had to beg for water when they say you get complimentary drinks. YEAH RIGHT NEVER AGAIN. 5 STAR HOTEL WITH 2 STAR SERVICE AT BEST"
Expensive but fun,"My boyfriend and I spent a day at The Land of Legends water park. It was really fun and the staff spoke very good English. They were all very helpful and friendly.Depending on the ride and how busy the park is, the waiting time for a ride could be anything up to 1hr. We bought fast tracks which were around ¬£50 each but well worth it when looking at the massive queues. For food we went back into the Land of Legends shopping centre which was a lot cheaper. It was annoying that no one told us that we had to upload credit onto our bracelet passes- you have to use this if you want to buy anything in the park.All in all, it was a fun day but very expensive if you're in a big family especially."
Well worth a visit,"You can't be wrong with a visit to the Land of legends. The place is mesmerizing, just great for everybody, small kids, big kids, friends, couples, there are so many things to do. If you are an adrenaline junkie, you can get your head spinning on the rollercoaster, rockets and other activities for brave people. The lazy river was fantastic, the wave pool, the plane flight. There is a great choice of restaurants, places for ice creams and desserts, also there is a Starbucks nearby (but not in the complex of the activities). Even if not everybody from your company like adrenaline activities, there are plenty of other things to do. The shopping street at the entrance of the park is one of them. In any case, it is well worth a visit and a day of your vacation time"
Wonderful,"Nice park, we had a wonderful time, enjoyed every moment. Very good place for kids with variety of options of water slides, 5D movies, dolphins, beluga and morse shows. Only one remark - long waiting times for some attractions"
Love the rides,We spent a whole day in the theme park. I strongly recommend fast track. It's expensive but without it you spend more time waiting for slides than enjoying them. Expensive food though!
MR.HAMDIEH FAMILY,Well its marvelous . its tremendous big we had a lot of fun  . i dint like the way of charging us although we bought  a ticket . for example fast rout extra things . anyway good job . And for froward legend
Water park mayhem ,"We recently visited the theme park on a day trip from our hotel (family of four, two adults and kids 15 and 11). As we were staying in a Rixos, there was a free shuttle bus and entry included. Must say if I had paid would have been gutted as this place is not cheap.  First the positives, good system with the lockers which you can hire for the day and return to as many times as you want, theme park section is good, the kids really enjoyed the rides and did not have to wait too long, dolphin show was excellent. Negatives, we were there in August and it was crazy busy. An hour long wait for all of the big water slides and no where to sit. We went on the water rapids and that was it, as the kids weren‚Äôt prepared to wait for the others and to be honest they weren‚Äôt that different to what was on offer at our hotel. We also thought the food was really expensive. We put ¬£50 on our wristband and that didn‚Äôt cover lunch for four. We shared two starters and two mains (pizza and burger) between four of us, with three soft drinks and a beer. We were 30p short so had to order a cheaper burger, as they don‚Äôt take cash and our order had used up the wristband.  We did enjoy the day due to the theme park, but we won‚Äôt be going again."
Land of legend them park ,"We were 5 people in total and one of our children was 3 months old, no money was taken from him and the other 4 people and the total entrance is 1200 TL if it is made online.by the Web site.If your visit is high time of the season, I strongly recommend you to buy a fast track.I regret to say that if you have a small baby there is definitely no area for them.Since there is no suitable place for babies, they will be affected by the sun or sound.Most good place wich I found is tropical bar but front of this bar :) is dj with very bad sound of speaker ;) Totally for adults no bad but they shut also think about family and there is no place nicely shadow I hope some people will read my comments from this place and for the future they can make the best :) inside every think with charge"
what a nice place to experience a fun in antalya,"the place it self amazing a lot  of attraction there many swimming pools , games and awesome shows .highly recommended ."
Weekend,"Everything here is amazinggg ü§©ü§©ü§©,I came here with a recomandation and I loved this place so much üòÅ"
Very fun and clean ,"It was really good. Queues were a bit long in the water park, especially from 1-3pm so I‚Äôd advise going earlier or later than this. Lovely for the whole family and had rides for adrenaline junkies as well as people who prefer to not go on huge roller coasters. The food was good and there were plenty of ice cream/ popcorn stalls to choose from. Over all a lovely time."
Great day but expensive ,"We went by taxi to LOL, from our hotel on Lara Beach. We were told from our guest relations to visit here using a taxi meter, rather than a fixed price. This cost 100tl and 110tl each way. I am glad we visited LOL on our own rather than with a tour operator. We could please ourselves when we attended and left. We purposely arrived early to purchase our tickets and as soon it opened at 1000, we headed straight for a sun bed to drop our towels and day bag off. We managed to go on 2 of the slides before the queue started to build up. We then managed our day using the other fatalities such as the Wave pool and watching the Dolphins shows, etc. Food here is expensive. At around 5pm we left the water park and walked across to the dry park which is opened till around 9pm. We managed to go on all the big rides, without queuing no more than 5 minutes. This was brilliant. Because we were not restricted for times, we choose as and when we decided the leave. Taxis are freely available upon exiting the venue.For a family of 5, LOL is a very expensive day. Tickets already puts a hole in your pocket. The food is basic. Everything in this place is inflated and they not seem to tell you the prices of items unless you ask.Expect to have a great day, but heavy on the wallet."
The lol,Awesome adventure in the theme park. We really enjoying our day. The meat slide is a magicon and sea voyager
Wi fi,"The wi fi is not working or connection very slow  , park is nice place , and  as we residents from hotel Kindom , hotel very good"
brilliant place,"The park is immaculate and well laid out, plenty of eateries and charging points. 2 teens and 5 adults spent all day in large waterpark which closes at 6.30, very long queuing for some so does need re-organising. Then into fairground until 9pm, though this can be accessed at any time during the day, again well laid out. Carry on into area in front of hotel to beautiful area with amazing shops, eateries and entertainment, we were in the complex from 10am to 10.30pm, well worth the cost and highly recommended"
One of the worst aqua park I've seen,Very long lines for very short items (we spent 7 hours there for just 5 items!)Really suffering ground for barefoot üòñToo expensive food
Nice attraction ,"We had free access as guests of the rixos premium hotel, the place is huge and quite crowded, it was certainly a chore to keep the children in order with all the different rides and pools, all in all quite nice but busy."
"Superb theme park overall, on par with Florida theme parks","We visited as a family of 5 & thought the price was a tad expensive for a Turkish theme park before we arrived HOWEVER, it was good value after our visit. On the day we visited (Thursday), the water slides were fairly busy (average 30-45 mins wait) but when we visited the roller coaster rides in the afternoon, they were extremely quiet, lucky if we queued more than 10 mins for majority of rides. Dolphin/Walrus show was good entertainment midday. Wave pool..........man, those life guards love the sound of their whistle, lol. Appreciate they're on guard & to protect everyone BUT that's all you heard whenever the waves were on. Nothing negative to report albeit food prices were a tad on the expensive side for simple fast food. Expect that though when there's no competition. Overall, a great park & would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys water/thrill rides. I go to Florida regularly & this is on par with the theme parks from there."
Park,A lot of people we have To wait more than one hour its note interesting We are didnt know About fast track
Th√© lol,It‚Äôs to long to wait until i play a gameand also we need some thing to protect us from sun when we wait
Number one entertaining place in belek,It was a bit expensive for admission & gamesFood court has no big choice : closes early on weekends Shopping avenues is nice
"Probably one of the best parks in the world, if not THE best","I have travelled to almost each corner of the world and been to Dubai's Wild Wadi Waterpark and USA's Volcano Bay by Universal and to be honest this is miles better compared to both of them and Atlantis waterpark - why? Because the resort is not only huge but incorporates a waterpark and theme park with rollercoaster rides so gives you the best of both across one site. The admission is approx ¬£50 and well worth it in my opinion coming here approx. 5 weeks ago. I am still left amazed at the beauty, standard and quality of the rides and experience - looks and feels brand new with a shopping centre and hotel on the complex too. It is located close to the airport, arrive early morning to get more time and I felt it was the biggest mistake to not have paid extra for fast track - just pay extra it is justifiable as the queues for the popular ride are huge especially in high season periods like July and August. The staff communicate well in all languages, good service and plenty of amenities across the complex and features the wristband which can be topped up with credit to spend on gifts and food very handy for an ice cream pit stop - to be fair the food is not overpriced as you would expect. As I didn't properly research and contemplate getting the fast track - I was able to go on several rides but still wanted to go on a lot more which was a shame; so take my advice and pay extra for the fast-track admission pass. And locker of course this is essential and works very efficiently via the wristband. Everything is very well maintained, even the toilets thank goodness. But I could recommend clearer sign posts and more signs to direct to different parts of the park as we spent a lot of time walking backwards and forth. But the guest relations direct you on your whereabouts. Also I'd like to say it's an amazing spot to take pictures and the entrance is truly magnificent. Distribute more time towards the waterpark rides, they are one of a kind!The money is well spent and a great day in Antalya, an absolute must you do not want to miss out otherwise what's the point of coming here!"
"Monumental park, superb attractions but soooo exteme expensive","Despite of the extreme hot we really enjoyed the park.We would needed a bit more green because by day it can be extemely hot and there are not too many shady areas.Food and drink are extemely expensive, slice of pizza  35-45 TRY"
A must see theme park,"I've visited this amazing place yesterday with my family. It's a huge theme park, Rixos Land of Legends. There are water attractions, land attractions and shopping street. If you come Antalya, you shoould go there and take your children too.Only minus is that it's too hot. All other is only advantage. Go there and enjoy"
"Fun day out, got expensive quickly","It was a good day at the park, but there are only a few good rides for adults. It was really hot when we visited so we got fast track tickets to avoid queuing, this all added up to being an expensive day."
Amazing place but very busy!!,"We didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel but we booked a day trip to the land of legends on one day of our holidays. It‚Äôs approx 20 minutes on a bus from Antalya. The place itself is AMAZING! So much to see and do. Lovely and clean and you can see why it‚Äôs so expensive to stay at the hotel. We visited the water park and went on the slides, had a really nice lunch and watched the dolphin show. The walrus is so funny! Only problem we found was that it was SO busy but then again it was August. On average we were waiting 45 minutes for the slides and due to the time we were being picked up it meant we only actually got on 4 of them! Expensive day out for 4 slides!!! That said, when we were leaving the ques for the slides had dropped to 5 minutes so if we‚Äôd had an extra hour or so we could have done a lot more. My advice would be that if you‚Äôre going to go go on the water slides first before they get busy and don‚Äôt book transport just get a taxi, that way you are not constrained by times. There‚Äôs so much to do here but we just didn‚Äôt get time to go round it all, I think you‚Äôd need a good couple of days to get round it all."
Very nice but...,"The park is very nice but I thought it was missing attractions for kids who are taller than 120cm but shorter than 140cm. The smaller rides were either too slow and boring for them and the bigger rides they were not allowed to try. However, if you are there, it is worth the visit. We were lucky when we went at night at around 4:30pm as it wasn't crowded."
Wonderful Park,"the park was so wonderful since it has both aqua park and theme park since you can have all day fun and if you are already a guest in the land of legend hotel your entry will be free which is a very good deal. Also it is good that they have fast track for many rides and you have to pay extra charge for it, the food is expensive in the park also the drinks but all in all the park you will have so much fun even if you have kids with you"
Oh my god,Everything perfect in tropical bar recommended watermelon kokteyl staff is friendly and great thanks ..
Park,We really enjoyed the attractions of the whole park. The staff was friendly and helpful. Fast track really helps . It‚Äôs also safety place !
‚ÄòLand of queue‚Äôs‚Äô ,"Sorry to be the negative one here but I have never been to a place with such a ridiculous queuing system. The queues were all an hour long for the descent slides and we only got to go on 3 slides all day as I couldn‚Äôt bare queuing in the heat any longer. Some slides have 1 queue for 4/5 different slides so although one slide maybe free, you can‚Äôt use this unless you stand in the hour long queue. Such a shame as it could have been a great day!"
Theme park!,"Theme park perfect for kids good fun really enjoyed The facilities at the park, good selection of water slides and for all age!"
Holiday time,"Thanks for unforgettable   memories and time , that we are spent here , good place for adults and children, special thanks to Mehmet (guest relations) for some advices üòòüòòüòò"
"Fun, fun, fun","Great slides and rollercoasters. Entertainment is guaranteed. Cheerful and friendly staff, especially at the white and blue rollercoasters. Be sure to take a fast track. Cleanliness is ok. Food is bad, we couldn't find a tasty meal."
Ok. Pricey. Probably better elsewhere,"Reviewing bit from within the grounds right now. Expensive. I'd have been fine with the ticket prices at the door for a family of 4 but once you're in and get into some of the pools and you think we're home and dry...oh no ""that area is reserved for hotel guests sir"". Why build it and open it up to the public only to then create a separate right of access to beach chairs that are around the pools? Why not just open a separate pool for your guests in your hotels if you think they need to be in some phantasmagorical bubble where 'normal' people aren't allowed chairs? The food is expensive but ok. Maybe eat before setting out? Or after visiting though your food options appear somewhat limited outside the theme park/shopping centre as it's a tad bit of a drive from Antalya. Probably just grin and bear it once you're in. As already been said you pay money they charge it onto bracelet you want grub they tag bracelet yada yada yada which though somewhat deceptive by pulling one into some sense of security it kinda allows you to set an upper limit on what you spend.And those lifeguards rattling off on their whistles anytime anyone moves forward in the wave pool!? What's that all about? The pool is that long all the best ay up to the rope at the top and obvious sides but do some reason prrrr prrrr prrrr everytime someone gets within 3 metres of those obvious barriers.... obvious to enough even for someone on Mars to see.I'd have probably brought the score to 2.5 over the chairs above alone but it does have its merits this the uplift to 3."
The activities ,"All the games are wonderful & enjoyable.I recommend to get the ""FAST TRACK"" bracelet to avoid the traffics.There is many shops in the same area.No need to carry your wallet, you will charge the bracelet which is good thing.The them park ticket is expensive. It took a full day from me & my wife (12 hrs)."
Great time - went back for another day,"Great park, def recommend. Lots of activities, pools were clean and well lifeguarded. Drinks and snacks not too expensive. Lockers available and money on wrist band was a great idea so not carrying around your bags and money all day. Theme park had good selection of rides for adults and children. Animals looked well and happy."
Amazing,"For family and fun I recommend this place, It is full of water games, pools for every age, slides, adrenalin slides and much more, if you are visiting Antalya with family this should be a place to visit, very clean, professional staff, high quality service, it is a huge place so for babies you need a stroller, to get benefit of most of games your kids must be 130 cm and more."
Park,It is realy a lagent where i advise all my friends to visit . Me and my family had avery nice time with all games and restaurants
Park,"I like it too much, I hope to came again the staff are really nice and very friendly,I think is a good place for holidays"
Park,Excellent family trip  nice team relax place..you can find everything you want there. We recommended this place
Magical ,Loved it. It has sooo much variety for all ages. We stayed there. It closes at 6 pm. So better to spend the day there then after 6 pm move to the dry park which is also very entertaining. For families who are staying in the hotel. All of this is free. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Park,"Everything is good, very good place for adult and children, very beautiful and clean place , we will come back again for sure  Thank you"
Park,"Everything is so nice, food is a little bit expensive, but everything else, 10+ Everybody can find something for them üòÅa"
Acceptable Theme Park but could be better ,"I paid 120 trl for taxi to reach at The lands of legends from Antalya Lara but the return cost was almost double because the taxi area rate in that area is much more expensive.I paid 345 trl for adult's ticket and 276 trl for children which was reasonable because this  cost included the Aqua park , Dolphin watching, many type of roller coaster and etc.The fast track ticket is 300 trl which is not reasonable and very few people were using it.They spent a huge amount for this park but I have doubt whether they are in profit margin. Park need an immediate survey by a  consultant for review the system which is used there. I believe they can easily increase their benefit level as well as customers satisfaction level. For example there is common queue for different game. People who are going to 4th floor can see 3rd floor entrance are empty and nobody use it while many peoples are in long queue. You can't see such this man power in a park at any country but their efficiency is minimum because the park system is very weak. It means good facility with very weak management system.The food and drink are so expensive. Water 6 trl , potato chips approximately 40 trl and etc. Out of few restaurant no bar and shops has written their prices which is illegal in most of countries. Personnel are very polite,  supportive and able to speak English.The dolphins show was so amazing and perfect. The show time mentioned in park map & show time guide which you can collect it in entrance.The weather is too hot at these days (approximately 40+) and we couldn't enjoy that much we expected."
Park,Great family park with great service !Great for all age and very friendly . Abbos was number one ! Well done We will be back
Park,"I see this is excellent  and I like it so much also I have fun thanks , we will come again , in the next summer"
Very long wait,"Park in nice, but veery log wait for water slides, minimum waiting time to any slide was 45 minutes, to most popular more than 1 hour.I suggest in day time go to rollercoasters, there was very short wait, because everyone was waiting in waterpark.Also you have to pay extra for private locker."
Huge park,"A very nice and high quality entertainement! Intresting dolphin show, big side for the water park. Very nice environment! Good day for a family!"
park,"theres like an another world, you feel like you‚Äôre in a big castle like old times its closed to world i love it"
Good but that's about it,"Booked in for the ""Land of Legends"" experience at a total cost including transfers of ¬£200 for a family of 3. Astronomical.in my opinion for what is on offer. You have to load your wristband with cash at the guest relations which is necessary as you are mugged at the front gates by security for any food and drink k, which I think is totally wrong and takes away the pressure which should be applied to this attraction. The park is exceptionally clean and tidy, the rides look in good repair, but such was the wait times etc we only managed 5 rides in 6 hrs. The most annoying thing in this park is though, that none of the catering or vending areas give a price list or a receiptz so when you are there from 10am intil 6pm you cannot keep track if your spend, and when they charge you ¬£6 for a slushie and an ice cream, each I hasten to add, you can see how it affects tour day. Not a bad venue but really hits your pocket with the monopoly imposed by the site."
Theme park,"Actually the land of legends was one of my favorite experiences. The coasters, aqua park, and the place‚Äôs design were breath taking. Stuff were so friendly and everything was honestly great!! I recommend it for everyone visiting antalya."
Theme park,Very good place and niceAll children can play owsom But we need more kind of payment ability we will come back in the next year
The theme park,I like the high slides because its fun and very exciting.i be happy when i arrive here and i will come again when i grow up.the hotel has good service and nice decoration
Park,"We like the park This is first time for us but not the last time Just please we see only two place for towels, I think need more .. Also the lifeguard please some of them need more training to be polite with us .. Thank you üôèüèº"
Expensive but good,"I buckled to pressure to go here even thought it was rather expensive.  Its a good park with plenty of rides but wet and dry.  The usual queues for the better rides you can get a fast pass ticket but OMG they rip the ass out of the cost of that I think it worked out to be near enough half the entrance ticket.  My main gripe about the park is that the walkways to water slide is rough concrete I mean I'm no flower petal but the soles of me feet were sore walking up to them (you have to remove all footwear at start of q) and there is very little shade - fine if its a short/quick q but some of them can take 30+ minutes so you are hot, sticky and if not creamed up (kids especially) you can suffer.  The are some weight limits for some of the rides so if you are on the larger side then be aware as I can;t think of anything worse than waiting in those q's and then being turned away when you get to the top.Read a few complaints about food being expensive I didn't find that it was in line with what I'd expect to pay at any other attraction.Oh and if you are in a hotel and your reps are charging the earth for transfers (looking at you Tommy cook) just jump on the bus for Belek which takes you within walking distance of the park entrance for a few lira."
Amazing day at Land of Legends,"Best day of our holiday ! Brilliant loved it from start to finish. We took our 9yr old and 14yr old they both loved it we met friends there. If you are unsure about going like us because of queues or heat I can ensure you it is not a problem. You may wait a little while for a couple of the slides but it is summer! It‚Äôs worth the wait. We went the theme park at 3pm and ran on every single ride waited 5 mins at most! 9yr old went on everything at 130cm, two huge rollercoasters aswell you can buy video footage, expect rickshaw which is 135cm. Ground are lovely, very clean exceptional service, staff all lovely, polite. Wave pool fab nice bar behind it. Food in open restaurant was amazing and it‚Äôs table service. Defo worth going! Don‚Äôt be put off like we nearly was!"
Holiday,"It was amazing trip to Antalya, land of legend is the best destination for familyFood , juiceand pool. Good summer vibes"
Turkey 2019,"Great park, great day out for kids teens, lots to do. Some of slides have long queues, theme park small but has a good selection for different age group rides"
Sea voyage,"Came to this water slide for the first time with family and my son came just under 120 cm and was not allowed on the slide though he is can swim and was accompanied by an adult (father) , very disappointing because my son loves the water slides and was very upset ! Some older children are old enough to go and because of there short height they are let down !"
Nice,"The park is clean and tidy, good facilities. Love the lockersystem. Our three children seg 5, 7 and 9 had a blast in the park. The youngest really enjoyed the area with the smaker waterslides. It was a bit disapointing for her with a lot of rides with 120cm limits, but of course we understand regulations are needed.We only had limited time at the park because of our bus so sadly we didnt see everything. We will be coming back!"
Park,Amazing games and perfect service! The food was very good. I liked the way you used to pay for things with your bracelet!
Great Place,I loved everything about the placeI recommend getting the fast track ticket to avoid waiting in lines at the theme gamesIt was an unforgettable experience!Suitable for all ages Food is not expensive Games are exciting
Huge complex,"We had free entry as we where staying in a Rixos hotel, so we decided to go as the weather 1 day was wet, a small version of sea world in Florida that must have cost a fortune to build, great roller coaster at the back of the park that is ell worth going on if you like these rides, the place was pretty empty and the huge shopping mall was like a ghost town. Dolphin show etc was good and it was a nice place to visit seeing the weather was poor that day. Not sure how much the entrance price is, from what I gather it is around ¬£40, which in my eyes is not really worth it."
Not the best hotel and definitely not worth to spend more than a day,"The land of legends is good hotel ,and the staff good with the kids ,  there is a lot  of things to do but not for all ages and not for to long , the activities is not organized and they missed one while we where staying we called them and they said they will come after 10 min but they didn't , it‚Äôs overrated and overpriced, there‚Äôs no beach and not to much of swimming pool it‚Äôs mostly slides , its good to visit it for a one day not more . Everything beside the breakfast and the dinner that you payed at  first it is not free no drinks or snacks it not inclusive anything even in the room the water is just free . As I said it just good for a one day visit . The food and the drinks they sell it it also overpriced. There is some hotels and resorts better to go to it üëåüèª Note: I stayed for 5 night , it was to much!"
liked it,i visited land of legends 3 days in a row. the place is good but should not be compared to Disney. the rides & lazy river were ok. there are not to many shades in the place. my kids liked it.
Just too crowded :(,"I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place because it‚Äôs too crowded and you have to wait for some attractions more than one hour. I think nobody wants to pay that price and spend all day waiting in the line. Unfortunately, one part of the park was closed and they didn‚Äôt announced that. Also I was robbed (sunglasses) and even they have CCTV all around the park, they couldn‚Äôt (or they didn‚Äôt want) to find the thief.Besides, the park is really nice and clean. You have beautiful shopping zone where you can really enjoy. For theme park I can say I‚Äôve seen better. For kids it could be very funny, but for adults it‚Äôs just to crowded."
Great day with kids,"We recently visited Land of Legends with my Mom (70 y.o) and 2 young kids (7 and 5 y.o.). Since we had little kids with us, we focused mostly on kids related activities. As expected park is very crowded, when we arrived by 10 am (opening of the park) there were crowds of tourists (mainly Russians) coming with tour companies, but staff at the entrance dealt with crowds very effectively and soon we reached first kids play area (next to the spray area) with 5 slides for kids taller than 100 cm and small water play area for kids with kiddie slides and knee depth swimming pool. Our 5 y.o was scared to go down the 5 taller slides as when she reached the bottom she momentarily went under the water even though the water level was up to her neck), so she refused to go down again despite kind urging and support from lifeguards (they were very patient with her, giving hugs and offering to catch her in the water). As of note, parents can't go on these slides but can waddle in the kiddie pool. Next stop was at the Aqua tower (just a few steps away from kids area to the left). This is an amazing place for kids (5-9-year-old) and parents. Both kids could go on all the slides and I could join them too. We spent at least an hour there and enjoyed it very much.  Some slides have a wait 5-10 min, some have no wait time at all. Unfortunately Secret Lagoon was closed during our visit and we couldn't explore it. We spent about 2.5 hrs at the water side of the park and then went to have lunch at Nemo restaurant. It is quite a unique and quiet place, as you are seated next to the huge aquarium with tropical fish and sharks. An unforgettable experience, albeit at a premium price (roasted salmon with vegetables 125 tl; kids chicken noodle soup 35 tl). We enjoyed it, the food was delicious and the whole experience worth it. Next stop was the dry area of the park, where kids had so much fun riding carousel, uptown loop, sweet swings and others. We spent 7 hrs at the park and it was just enough for little kids. They had a great experience and so did we. Park is very clean and well maintained, guards are courteous, helpful and diligently working to make sure kids are following the rules and everyone is safe. Recommend for families with small kids, really a great and memorable experience!"
Great day out,"Land of legendsI visited land of legends (LoL) with my family 2 adults and two kids! (17 and 20) three times during our stay in Belek.We were staying and the Rixos Premium in Belek and the hotel offers a free shuttle bus and entry to the park from 10am each day.  The last bus back to the hotel is at 23:15.  You can also get a cab for for 16 euro‚Äôs each way.When you arrive at the park you are given a wrist band to access to the park and rides.  I think you also need you room key gain access back into the LoL hotel.The park is really nicely presented and in great condition.  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  We also eat at one of the restaurants, again the ambiance, staff and food were excellent, food was also good quality and value.  The only problem with the park is that EVERYTHING you buy is paid for via your wrist band, which has to be loaded with Turkish lira.  Any unspent money on the band is refunded as Turkish lira.  This is bit of a pain, i.e. when we had lunch, the waitress calculated the cost, took me to a wrist band loading point, loaded my wrist band with the money and used the wrist band to pay for lunch.   This is not to bad for lunch, but really puts you off impulse purchase such as ride photo‚Äôs.  LoL, please can you allow card payments in the park, you would take more money!Our first visit was on the 7pm bus from the hotel, this allows access to the dry side of the park as the wet side closes at 6:30pm.  The park is great at this time as the que for the rides is very short, we walked straight on to the hyper coaster (5 times) and typhoon lagoon (twice) before the park closed at 9am.  We then stayed for the boat parade which goes through shopping area.  The show starts at 10pm and winds its way through the shopping area over the course of 45 mins.  I advise finding a place to sit on the steps at the end of the mall with the water fountains.  The fountains start the show and are amazing.  The show consists of dancers and acrobats and moves along from the fountains down towards the stage coach and back the hotel entrance.  I have no idea what the story is behind the show, but it is spectacular.The other visits to the park were made via the 10am bus from the hotel.  The water rides get pretty busy, so i advise knowing what you want ride and heading there quickly.  We walked virtual straight onto the magicone (brilliant) and rocket drop, but by the time we had done both of these rides, the queues were starting to form and we had to wait 30 mins to ride the tower.  We found the typical daytime ride que to be between 30 and 45 mins.  There is also a dolphin show at 11:30 and one in the afternoon, which is pretty good, but there is no need to arrive early for the show.As a guest of Rixos premium hotel, it is well worth visiting LoL, but i would not go for the whole day, as it gets too hot and the queues are long during the day.  Apart from having to pay via wrist band it is a great place to visit."
We had a great time at The Land of Legends,"This is a must visit for anyone going to Antalya, especially those travelling with children. The water park is excellent and health & safety is a priority with all the staff. This is an extremely well managed and organised theme park."
Terrible and humiliating,"Hello! I am very dissapointed in your treatment of the customers. Me and my 21-year old daughter were staying in Titanic Deluxe Belek. Here, she was allowded to take all the water slides. We were therefore very excited to visit the Land of Legends Theme Park July 25. We have never been denied in taking attractions in waterparks and theme parks anywhere. However, the young security person at one of the attractions got scared of my daughter (she has a diagnosis) and did not allow her to take it. He emberassed and hurt her in front of the whole line. We contacted the manager, who was just as rude and superior in his treatment. Our translator however, was a very nice guy who had emphathy and understanding. We left the theme/aqua park after this situation, as we felt ourselves upset and unwelcomed. Although we did not take any attractions, they refused to return our ticket prices. Later on, we did not receive any apology for this behaviour and treatment. My daughter and I were shocked and very upset due to this situation. We did not expect anything like this in a muslim country, especially in such a popular tourist location."
marvelous,"excitement of children and variety of choices , day pass quickly , intensive entertainment , fast track is useful specially on crowded days....."
Much better than expected,"Clean, good service, not that long lines when we were there. Good value for our money. Perhaps a few more attractions is needed to be a great theme park. The waterpark was good as well. Even though the life guards kept on disturbing all guests with their constant whistling."
Amazing ,"Excellent customer service , delicious food , professional staff....It was an amazing dolphin show with full entertainment for kids and family."
Ruba,A very fun experience in a safe place. I highly recommend it. You should buy the fast track to benefit from activities or else u have to wait for long hours per activity.
Bit over hyped ,Theme park not as we imagined...few rides then water park. Cashless system whatever currency you load up on your wrist band you get back in lira.Approx 45 min wait for water slides and when it's so hot its unbearable.We spent most time in wave pool that was fun.Food...burgers pizza etc The grounds are lovely with a type of shopping mall in the entrance and the actual hotel looks lovely.¬£270 pounds for the four of us...12 and over are classed as adult.The dolphin show is the best part
All left sunburnt because of poor queue planning ,"The slides in the water park were fab, it was clean and well staffed. The problem was the queuing systems were badly thought out with excessive rules about not wearing t shirts the combination of which led to all of us getting sunburn despite already being in Turkey for a week and not having an issue before. Work needs to be done on the fast track system and on the single queue for 7 slides (including one of the most popular ones) meaning the slide we wanted was empty for at least 40 mins while we waited. In the end in an entire day we managed 4 slides.The wristband system for paying was good."
"5 stars for queue practice, if you need a little more experience in queueing and burning...","Could be an absolutely fabulous place if it weren't for the ridiculous queues and terrible planning.We managed five different water slides in our whole day out - all of which, to be honest, were great but were not worth up to an hour of queuing each.The park needs a rethink on their queue systems - badly planned, badly run and terribly designed!Why have one queue for nine different slides? There are four queues for the nine slides in the first tower - all of which end at a single gate where only some from each queue are allowed up at a time - effectively bringing it down to one queue. One of those 4 queues is for 7 different slides, so you wait while the other two slides are let in bit by bit while the slide you're waiting for sits empty... Queuing 40 mins for an unused slide is pretty infuriating.The sun - there are, admittedly, some points in the queue which are shaded. But after an hour in the queue you're lucky to spend half that under cover. In the heat of the Turkish sun, when you've left all but your swimmers at the start of the queue it very quickly gets painful and dangerous.Fast track - needs a rethink. A constant stream of people while the rest of us wait. Stop them in blocks, let the rest of us get a go! And to fast track twice in one queue and screw normal queue over twice? Poor!The park is clean, huge, friendly and the RFID cashless wristbands are great in a waterpark. The slides we did get time to go on were exciting and original. Such a shame so little thought or planning seems to have gone into the queuing and it ruined what would have been a fabulous day. We're very lucky our kids aren't ones to scream and moan (too much!).If you think UK theme parks are bad, if you enjoy choosing the slowest till at the local Tesco or you think a hot beach bod requires skin like crushed Doritos then this place is for you... otherwise, wait until they realise and change their layout!"
Lol,"When I entered I felt excited, swimming pools are really good,aqua slides Pretty cool I enjoyed , service is really quick and easy, Huseyn is really helpful."
Lol,"Theme park atmosphere is very good , hosting guys is so good ?, babies enjoyed too much , Long waiting time on slides , slides is good and enjoyable, everything is good."
Lol,"Theme park is great and everything is and good , aqua slides is fun and good , roller coaster especially hyper coaster is extremely fun."
Lol,"Theme park is really nice it has everything you need enjoy , swimming pools clean and nice , service is on a good level it‚Äôs quick and fast . thanks to Huseyn for help."
Lol,"Theme park is good i liked , pools are like activity is perfect happy, safety is good lifeguards everywhere , personnel is good and kind ."
Fun holiday with family ,"It is the best park I have ever been to and it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful water park it work for kids and teenagers and old people plus it‚Äôs very safe for the kids to hang around alone and play everywhere , lifeguards are there to help in anything and what I like the most about it that they care about you and your kids and your things ."
Amazing day and night activities,"I have visited the park twice with a group of kids, teenagers, and adults. The first visit was during the day and the other visit was during the night. The day-time visit was to both the dry and wet parks. In general we had an excellent experience. However, I have put 4 stars because for our bad experience with the ticketing. I have booked the tickets online one month before the visit. I assumed that this will save time upon arrival, but it was disappointing that I had to wait for 20 minutes till they sort out a technical issue regarding my ticket number (PNR).  They said that the have changed the PNR system and the cannot find my ticket. This was not acceptable at all. Both wet and dry parks had variety of rides. There was no much waiting time. In fact, in the dry park there was almost no waiting time. Staff are friendly. There are a lots of cafes and shops. There is also a hot balloon, but it did not operate due to the weather. The dolphin show, which does not require extra cost, is beautiful. It is better to arrive 30 minutes before the show to choose a suitable seat. The night visit was also amazing with the lights, music, and fountain show. Unfortunately, there were no shows on the day of our visit. Yet, we enjoyed our tube shopping and dinning. In general, the Land of Legends is a must-visit place in Antalya."
Not expected,It was the first time when we visited this place its really amazing place a lot of activities BUT not private safes for free. In the entrence security checked bags and not allowed water. Try only one attraction taken one hour because of queue crowded people. Thats ok next big problem they not allow use mobile phones and no safe to put it. During the slipping you should take of shoes in result you go by stones its really difficult especially in the sun.
Kids baking activity ,This activity was carried out by rofat and oxana. Two very very helpful..patient and kind individuals that are great with children. They both assisted every child in making their desired shape of cookie. Amazing hotel with amazing activities.
"Very nice to staying holidays with family, all every thinks goods, of staff "" hotel, clearly services,  kids club ","Miss saedah of working at staff so friendly,  she all always changing perfectly and helping we about everything we needs in staying  at THE LAND OF LEGENDS HOTEL ,we enjoying and happyfuull staying in THE LAND OF LEGENDS HOTEL"
Lol,"Theme park I liked wining pools , food quality is perfect, personnel behavior in a nice level , aqua slides very enjoyable , Thanks Huseyn for conversation."
Lol,"When I came to theme park I felt that is excellent, swimming pools very fine , aqua slides are extremely good, Service is really 5*, thanks Huseyn he helped us to make contact with waiter."
Not great,"Choice of baby rides or big rides for over 1.4m tall - my daughter is 9 years and 1.3m tall, therefore had 1 x ride to go on which was family coaster - a complete waste of money!!  Service from staff was not great."
La plancha,The hotel was amazing and the staff was friendly I spend most the time with the kids in the water park and I met one of the staff ( yosuf) from la plancha restaurant he was so friendly and helpful .. it was great experience
Summer in Turkey 2019,Lot of programmes Sometimes to much waiting time For small children is okay Nice placeVery good delphine shows
Lol,"When i came to theme park i felt so excited so hood , swiming polls very fine i liked it , aqua slides also cool , service is not t* but a 20* . Thanks to Huseyn for his positive energy"
Great park one major issue,"If you go to this theme park DO NOT WEAR FLIP FLOPS!!! Wear shoes that are unlikely to fall off on the rides. They make you take off your shoes if they aren‚Äôt secure and a lot of the rides have metal loading platforms. I went to this park and thoroughly enjoyed my day, however me and my family wore flip flops to this park and by the end of it due to the metal loading platforms our feet were covered in cuts burns and blisters. We had to spend the last day of our holiday in Turkey in the room as it was so painful to walk. As good as the rides were they definitely weren‚Äôt worth being unable to walk because of our saw feet. I do not recommend you visit this theme park and if you do, WEAR SECURE SHOES!"
Lol,"The land of legends theme park is amaZing and very good I liked everything and my babies also , service is very very good, slides are perfectAnd fun ."
Lol,"From the first enter I felt happiness and enjoyment , swimming pools it‚Äôs good for kids and they families , babies says that aqua slides are amazing , service brilliant , Huseynvery kind guy thanks him for conversation"
Lil,I am a kingdom gast and iam from Qatar the swimming pool very nice and the staff are good and the safety role is very strong that nice
Nice place to have family vacation at!!,"It a very nice place. Friendly staff. However, they speak little English. Blenty of food. Nice music. Cozy swimming poolsA very nice beach."
small theme park,"you can spend one day in the resort  between shopping area ( tax free available) , water park, and small theme park ,average night show around 9-10 pm , plenty of restaurants , food expensive inside the park"
Great but long day out,"We went for a day trip to the aqua park and then the theme park late afternoon. The slides in the aqua park are fantastic but we really recommend that you upgrade to fast track to ensure you get on all the rides. If not then expect over 1 hour in queues. To be fair to the park they always ensure that you are in the shade whilst queuing and health and safety is number 1 priority. It is an expensive day out but it is worth it. If you don‚Äôt participate in any of the rides or theme park then don‚Äôt go, it will only end up in an expensive spectator day and your time would be better spent in another part of the complex. The staff around the venue were always courteous and the life guards were superb and were vigilant at all times. The theme park had some of the best rides I have ever experienced. Superb. It is however a long day in the sun and please ensure you pace yourself for the day. Paying at the gate proved the best option rather than going through our Tui rep who tried to rip us off. Highly recommend this for a day out but make sure you have the energy and bottle to go on all the rides."
Lol,"Thank you for an amazing day in a amazing and wonderful theme park , I can say that the park has a lot of surprises , swimming pools are clean and great slides are fun , personnel are very kind."
Lol,"Th√©me park is good , swiming pools and slides as sea voyager is extremely fun i had a good feelings there , personnel so kind and servicr fast , but cu is slow , And thanks for Huseyn he helped to find place to stay i waveshock pool."
Lol,"Theme park is very good , wave shock for kids is so good baby chilling and we also , sevice very fine , is really 5* service"
Nice show,Just a short visit in the evening to attend the show. Very nice water show and nice setup all over the place.
Too big!,"The place is insane! It‚Äôs huge with so much to do, we got overwhelmed and left after one hour.I think this place is fantastic for teens and young adults, or adventurers older adults.We are a family with a 5 years old, who needs time to warm up to new slides and rides, plus our hotel had a wave pool, slides and beach, so land of legends was not for us, just because we got everything on a smaller scale in our hotel.So I‚Äôd say YES, if you have teens, maybe not so much if you have children under 6.The shopping centre is also huge, I didn‚Äôt check the prices, but it looked amazing."
Lol,Such an amazing park. Water slides and roller coasters are amazing. It's a wonderland for adrenaline lovers.
Lol Amazing,"Hello this is my first day in your theme prk and i cannot say how wonderful your park is ,also babies liked that slides which is incredible thanks you"
Perfect ,"An amazing trip, with my sweet baby of 3 yod, the dolphin show is also perfect, recommend this place!!"
Was good ,Was good park and big for kids for adult very enjoyed place staff helpfull and friendly recommended all people ....
"Overpriced, queues, restrictions!!","We visited this park 2 years ago and had a great time that felt like good value. Not this time.We paid ¬£190 for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids aged 12 & 13 which seemed like a lot, especially with the current exchange rate of just under 7 lira -¬£.Everything seemed more expensive this year, especially the food. You cannot take your own food in which leaves you no option but to pay the high prices that they charge. Both of my kids are celiacs with special dietary requirements yet they weren‚Äôt adequately catered for and we struggled to feed them. No real concept of cross contamination!!!There were much more restrictions in place this year, even in the wave pool where there was a life guard stopping people going out above shoulder height, even though the vast majority of the pool wasn‚Äôt being used?!?! All the life guards seem to spend most off their time blowing their whistles at anyone for anything, in the end it became white noise that no one responded to!The worst thing for me though is he queues. You queue to get your ring, you queue to get in the queue, you queue at the top of the ride.......also, certain nationalities don‚Äôt understand the concept of taking their turn, yet the park staff seem to just accept it?! There was a ride that required blue toboggan mats that was massively underused because you have to join one big queue for about 4 other rides where people are waiting at the top, yet they only let a few through at a time regardless of what ride you want to go on?! This meant that for 90% of the time nobody was on this ride yet there were people in the main queue waiting to go on it?!Overall it was a disappointing trip for us, overpriced, large unnecessary queues and too many restrictions.Oh, and tell the life guards to stop. Losing their whistles so much, it‚Äôs ceased to be effective!"
Perfecr,This place very big and beatifull very fantastic food was good staff helpful and funny actvty pool vere relax ...
 Nice park but overpriced  ,"We are, as a family keen theme park and water park visitors and we‚Äôre looking forward to the idea of a water park / theme park mix,We spent the day here yesterday and found the entire place very clean and well presented however the hotel and shopping complex takes up a huge amount of the area of the park, we also thought there would be more to the theme park but this could be our own fault for not downloading the map in advance and taking a look at the rides etc so I would advise this is done before any visit, The water park is divided into areas and we spear time in the wave pool which is a sand beach with large waves which start around every hour, there are sun loungers and tables etc but if you want to use them you will need to get there early as when we arrived at 12pm everything was taken.We didn‚Äôt use the slides because our youngest is still 1 however the queues were between 30-60mins so we wouldn‚Äôt have been willing to wait anyway, I took my daughter on the two rollercoasters, the Hyper coaster is the biggest one and is ok but if your used to European coasters there‚Äôs not much too it, the queue line is ok but we both found the theming in the station a bit poor and we‚Äôre amused on how the staff cheer and clap as the train leave and arrives back in the station as if they‚Äôre surprised it came back.The other one is a splash coaster which doesn‚Äôt have a hill climb but a lift system, on the first drop we‚Äôre sure there should be water jets of something but no, just a bit simple and finish with a splash at the end.To buy anything on Park you have a chip in the wristband that you preload with cash, everything is priced in tl and if you have anything remaining once you finish this is also paid back to you in tl, the price on park for food and drink is very expensive, there are no meal pricing as everything is sold separately but even for theme park pricing and basic burger, chips and a drink would set you back roughly 100tl (¬£13-¬£14) and even a small bottle of water is 6tl.Bare this in mind as they don‚Äôt allow any food or drink to be taken into the park and all bags are checked before entering the park.The dolphin show was good and we all enjoyed watching this but make sure you arrive at least 30 mins early for a good seat, we did find the 15 min break a bit odd as they just used this as an excuse to sell photos and animal encounters, once the show restarted it was only for 10 mins and then is was finished which we found a bit annoying.On the outside of the park the shopping complex is extensive with various shops ranging from suitcases, cloths and food.There‚Äôs a internal mall which looked to have market stalls which were all empty and the entire shopping complex was almost empty, we were looking through at 4pm so this could change at night.There‚Äôs a number of food outlets including Burger King, Subway, Popeyes Chicken along with a number of others.Unfortunately we went to the park as an excursion through a tour company so our coach left @ 4:30pm but we would have liked to spend more time and see the show in the evening.Overall I would say it‚Äôs good as a water park, it‚Äôs poor as a theme park and it‚Äôs very expansive as any park."
