"So much, so cool ","If you want to know something of NT, visit here. FREE! And so much for the visitor to enjoy, plus extra exhibitions change over time. We though we were done, then found the maritime component, which is quite literally huge. We appreciated getting cultured while staying cool."
Wonderful experience,There are a lot of exhibitions going on and our favourite was the Cyclone Tracey exhibition. It was very informative and a lot to see. Our infant really enjoyed the space as well. As there is a lot of room and very stimulating exhibitions. I will definitely be back because the good thing about it is that it's free
Interesting museum and stunning Art.,We really enjoyed the art at the Gallery and the Telstra Indigenous Art Awards in particular. It would have been great to have had something to eat there but the Cafe was closed.
Good Especially For Cyclone Tracy,"This is a really good museum that caters to all tastes such as Aboriginal art and animals past and present - including Sweetheart, a famous croc up here - a maritime section and, for those keen to know the history of the NT and Darwin in particular, then this is the place. It also has a good section on Cyclone Tracy, before and after. Admission is free but they do have a box for donations, which is truly worth depositing a note. Even $20 is good value as I spent nearly three hours here."
Lovely museum,Darwin museum has some great exhibitions including my old favorite- the cyclone Tracey exhibit.  When we visited the indigenous art awards was on and very interesting
Must do,This museum is full of all sorts of historical artefacts and beautiful Aboriginal art- definitely needed a few hours to see it all! The Cyclone Tracey exhibit gave the kids a real sense of how horrific this would have been to experience and the sweetheart exhibit broke our hearts- A definite MUST DO
A wonderful place,It’s Free to enter and has a wonderful Collection of insects butterfly’s etcAboriginal Art works and Sweetheart the crocodile wow what a story...And the cyclone exhibited is scary 10/10
Darwin art and gallery museum ,"We visited the museum to see the cyclone Tracy display, which also has a room in complete darkness and simulates the sounds of a the early morning of when the cyclone happened.  The surprise was how amazing and large the rest of the museum was, allow some time to explore the many magnificent displays."
Definitely worth a visit,"This museum has art, history and an interesting collection of boats in the maritime section.  We spent two hours there and could have spent more."
History and Ancient Art,"We took a few hours to visit the Museum and Art Gallery. They have a series of art exhibits from up and coming, and credentialed indigenous artists, showing a range of interesting styles and medium.The Sweetheart exhibition  was also interesting, as well as the Cyclone Tracy Room.We nearly missed a spot, but walked to an outside ""room and saw the range of boats from Micronesia and surrounding areas. Wow.Take a few hours to look. There are lots of hidden rooms and grottos with interesting sights."
Cyclone Tracy History,Interesting small museum. We went to view the history relating to Cyclone Tracy which was very good. As usual there is also other interesting sections. Located a short walk to a boat ramp with nice water views
GOOD Display,"Great Museum, really good display of the top end, Excellent display showing the devastating result of Cyclone Tracy in 1974. A job well done.Aboriginal  art at the Northern Territory Art Display was done to perfection."
Fascinating Gallery,"We went to see the giant crocodile ( stuffed of course) & the geological fossils .... but this Museum has SO much more ! The  Cyclone  Tracy exhibition is very interesting , with real human interest ..... the fossils are fantastic , as are the examples of sea creatures  &  pre- historic  desert finds .Free entry , & comfortable  A/c provided a  welcome  respite from the heat of the day .  It appears to be a very new gallery ,modern & spacious ..... you need to take a taxi from town though, because it’s a long walk . The cafe is closed   ( Covid) so have  your  coffee before you go ."
Home schooling visit for History,"Absolutely amazed by this place, so many informative things, NT history, cyclone history, animals.. just perfect really and not to mention its all for free. Must do with kids if in Darwin"
Darwin Museum,"Took my 5yo son for a visit. Hasn't changed much over the years, but still worth a visit. The discovery room was closed which was a shame as was the cafe."
Wonderful insight into the history of Northern Territory,"This museum provides an amazing history of Darwin including Cyclone Tracy, Aboriginal history and Chinese Gold Rush and native animals. A must do for visitors and new arrivals into the NT."
Fine museum ,"Wonderful location, loads of parking, free entry. All real bonuses before you even look inside! The displays are clear and beautifully presented. The exhibitions are thoughtful and imaginatively laid out; flora and fauna, Aboriginal art related to the cosmos, and Cyclone Tracy. Top marks, plus a cool cafe/restaurant on site makes this a must do in Darwin."
History,Good learning here really enjoyed ourselves and will share the good times we had. Thankyou  for the memories
"Excellently done, and free.","We drove here - the tourist bus goes here at times I believe. It was a lovely museum incorporating the art also. Spent just over an hour here. Free, but we left a donation in the box."
A bit of culture,Nice museum. Our favourite bit was learning about the recent hurricane that had passed through the area of Queensland. I never knew Australia got that kind of weather. Good gallery’s as well.
Worthy of Your Visit,"The place was not large but the biological items were cleverly displayed on transparent acrylic plastic sheets. The artwork pieces showed the aboriginal masterpieces.  Also, another merit was free admission."
Art gallery and museum,There was plenty to see at the museum but the best part was probably seeing and learning about cyclone Tracy disaster it was very interesting
Wonderful Museum well presented,New building uniquely designed in modern style.  Nice choice of presentations of aboriginal artist both traditional and modern.  Several varied exhibits.  We will visit on future trips to Darwin.
Great service and good food,I visited this cafe before going  through the Museum and Art gallery. I ordered Pancakes with Maple Syrup and ice cream. They were excellent. I can recommend them to anyone who had a good appetite as the serve is large.
Excellent display. Not bad view of the beach as well,"This display was very good. Nice cafe attached. Well worth catching the big red bus if you dont have a car. Quite a big display. Allow a couple of hours. Paintings. Displays on Darwin events, animals and local indigenous people and lots more"
Very interesting experience in darwin,Wonderful displays of local wildlife along with located bones of mammals from days long gone. Interesting display based on the tragic cyclone Tracey from 1974. Def worth a visit whilst in Darwin.
Modern and relevant,Two highlights for me - Sweetheart and the Cyclone Tracey exhibition.  When you realise that the people who caught Sweetheart were in the water with her...And if you stand in the darkened room and listen to Tracey full bore...Enjoy.
Fabulous Cyclone Tracy Exhibit,"Learnt about Cyclone Tracy not sure if it was an exhibit or memorial but it is very well done and the ""cyclone room"" was an experience that I was not that keen on for longer than a couple of moments. The poor buggers who went through it in real life wow and the damage to the entire town extraordinary you hope it never happens again. Plenty of other exhibits but we were mainly interested in Cyclone Tracy. You can get here by the hop on hop off bus which is probably the best way to do it. We walked back into town which was about 30 minutes but it is only a stroll from the casino."
Outstanding Small Museum,"The variety of exhibits in this museum offers something for everyone.  Most impressive are the variety of birds, fish, lizards and reptiles presented in attractive and interesting displays.  Another room presents the catastrophic destruction of Darwin during Cyclone Tracy in 1974 using graphic displays.  A collection of photographs and artwork provide a great view into aboriginal life in not-to-distant past.  This museum is a real gem; well laid out and fun to visit.  It is hard to believe that it has no admission charge!!  Don't miss it!!!"
An interesting visit,The art here was mainly local aboriginal and interesting The museum part we found the most interesting with information about the history of Darwin. Also an excellent display of local animals and geology. A simple cafe on siteReception staff were particularly friendly and helpful
this is a good place lots to see and great outdoor by he beach cafe and yummy calamari,great displays and the displays not the Typhoon that hit in the 1990;s and feel and hear the sounds that went with and relive this - is a amazing feature. we had a great time here and we took the Hop on and hop off bus right to the door ..
Just amazing,"What a beautiful museum/ gallery to visit.  Thank you for having us. Great selection of local indigenous art, local attractions and exhibitions.  Great souvenir shop.  Such amazing staff.  So helpful. Congratulations."
Small Town Wonder,"For a city that has rebuilt itself every 50 years or so due to cyclones this museum exemplifies the peoples commitment to preserving their history.The first exhibit is on how the universe began with the moon and stars. What makes this exhibit unique is the perspective and juxtaposition of the aboriginal creation stories and western science.The next room takes you through the now fossilized flora, fauna, and prehistoric creatures. All tastefully done. The next several rooms move you through northwestern Australia’s history including the entanglement of racism between white, Asian and aboriginal peoples.One exhibit that you probably won’t see elsewhere is the one of Cyclone Tracy on Christmas 1974. To see the “then and now” images is testimony to the people’s fortitude and relationship to the land. The final exhibit is by Therese Ritchie. Her photos speak to her passion for the plight of the aboriginal people and politics of Australia. Definitely spend time here."
Easy to Access,"Lots of great exhibits, easy to make your way around and friendly staff,especially in the cafeteria..The Cyclone Tracey exhibit is excellent"
A concise but good museum and gallery,I missed out seeing the Sidney Nolan exhibition by a day! But I wasn’t disappointed with the rest. The Cyclone Tracey exhibit was very informative and interesting. As was the history of the area including artefacts.Felt the art gallery part was lacking a little - I know it’s a small town but feel this is one area they could focus on. Especially with so many great local Aboriginal artists around. Good coffee in the cafe with views over the beach.I got here using the hop on hop off red bus which worked out perfectly!
A Must-Visit for the First Timer to Darwin,"If you want to know Darwin a little better and you've not been there before, then the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory is a must.  It gives a gentle introduction to the place, and has permanent collections on Cyclone Tracy of 1974, fauna and flora of the region, Aboriginal art, as well as how Darwin transformed from a gold mining town to what it is today.  A good two to three hours are all it takes!"
One Night in Darwin,"I wasn't expecting much from such a small Museum and Art Gallery but is was fantastic.  Every item was displayed in an easy walk around manner, they had a Sidney Nolan exhibition and some of the local art work was amazing.   The Cyclone Tracy exhibit was an experience to understand how devastating this was to this city.  Definitely worth a stop.  Museum staff were so friendly and helpful ."
Excellent insight to local history ,"We visited the Museum first time on the 17th January 2020. This visit had to be cut short due to an electrical storm which knocked out the power to the museum not long after entering!We revisited the museum on Sunday 19th January 2020. This was well worth the return.The museum is full of fascinating facts and exhibits regarding the early history of the Northern Territory.There’s also an interesting section covering Cyclone Tracy.You can easily spend several hours in the museum, so make sure you plan accordingly"
FREE entry ,Was amazed that it was free to enterIf you have never experienced a cyclone this is the place to do in safety with their room that replicates the sound in darknessTo see the largest croc caught here up close OMG
Great combination of art and natural history,"This museum was an unexpected delight. There are a host of displays about the natural qualities of the area: a famous crocodile, the flora and fauna of the area, the history of the Christmas cyclone that decimated the town, the history of the indigenous people and who they worked for in the Northern Territory. Then, after all of that, there were a couple of art exhibitions that were excellent, with carefully created signage to indicate some of what the artist was trying to say. This museum was so much more than an obligatory stop at the local history place. If you're in Darwin, don't miss it."
A day at the museum,"Very well presented, and especially good for the family and children, a learning experience. Well located along the beach from, with a cafe to have a snack."
An excellent museum for everyone,"We did not expect much from the museum and art gallery of the NT. well, we freely admit it knocked our socks off! It is an excellent museum, with loads to see, all beautifully presented. And it’s free!"
Museum and Art Gallery of NT,The Museum and Art Gallery of NT are colocated in Darwin. The Gallery has an excellent collection of local indigenous art. The Museum has an excellent collection of NT history with a dedicated exhibition on Cyclone Tracy and the WWII bombing of Darwin.
Very Interesting ... ...,"Me and my dad spent like 3 hours going round the museum and I found it interesting. There are lots of exhibits and a monsoon garden. It is free, but the Sidney Nolan exhibit needs a ticket. It is 10  dollars for an adult and 3 dollars for a kid. It is a memorable experience."
Modern and Interesting,"Unfortunately Cyclone Tracey is the reason this museum has mainly modern artifacts, but.in spite of the lack of historical items, they have done a really great job to present unique and interesting displays. There is an excellent Cyclone experience, a large collection of asian fishing boats and countless other displays related to the culture of the top end. Definitely need more than a couple of hours here if you want to see everything properly."
Darwin Unexpected Museum,"Long weekend in Darwin on a hot humid day with a spare hour. 4 hours later still could have spent more time.  The bombing of Darwin well presented and interesting, we loved the boat display. Too much to comment on but allow plenty off time to visir"
Full of great arts,We planned just for an hour to spend in here but ended up staying more than half day enjoying and learning a lot in the museum. It is free most of the place except some special section for the time. The place is very kid/family friendly and many sections are full of useful display for any generation but mostly for kids. My primary school children enjoyed every section of the museum from history to drawing including war and cultural items. It is very northern territory suitable museum and what to expect to see in NT.
Wonderful museum,Great historic museum- don’t miss any level and be sure to visit the outdoor area to see the turtle and fish.  Great stop and you can pick up the Hop on off bus in the front.
Unexpected gem,A step back in history as we all learnt about the impact of cyclone Tracy and life in the 1970s in Darwin
I wish I had allowed more time,"This gallery is wonderful, identifying local, national and global issues. I wish I had allowed a couple of hours, one hour was not enough. I felt very moved by some of the exhibitions and educated by others. Something for all ages. My grandchildren would love the natural side."
Museum excursion,The museum was extremely well set out.  Displays included photographs of the aftermath of Cyclone Tracey which was interesting.  Also captivating were the several displays of insects and reptiles found in the Northern Territory.   Some friendly some not.
"Loved visiting this museum in the ""Top End"" (northern most part of Australia)","Museum is a jewel, fascinating to explore.  This was part of a cruise excursion, but the museum is free.  It has an eclectic  variety of works that cover nature, aborigine art, crafts, marine artifacts, as well as impressive special exhibits, etc..  Therese Ritchie's incredibly powerful, provocative, political,  poignant  and  oftentimes sardonic special exhibit will mesmerize -- it's called Bleeding Hearts - not to be missed; give yourself enough time to ponder it .   Fascinating, too, was  what looked like a permanent exhibit on the devastation wrought by Cyclone Tracy  around Christmastime 1974. Definitely worth your  visit should you be in this part of Australia. This time of year is summer in Australia, and the museum is wonderfully air conditioned."
A must visit in Darwin,"Reflecting no doubt the small size of the city, this is indeed a museum and art gallery, with displays of natural history, science, maritime history and fine art and craft rolled into one. While it is perhaps best know for its Aboriginal art, it also has a superb collection of work from Bali and other parts of south east Asia. If you make it there before June 2020 don't miss Therese Ritchie's superb ""Bleeding Hearts"" exhibition--a real tour de force from one of the Northern Territory's most prominent artists ... in fact this show alone is worth visiting Darwin to see!"
An excellent display,"Spent around 90 mins here looking at the exhibits. Shame the maritime exhibit was closed till mid 2020. But everything else was well laid out with great descriptions. The Cyclone Tracey section was particularly impressive. Loved the animals and wildlife of NT.The most impressive part was FREE entry, yes FREE. Maybe other public areas of NT should follow the lead of the Museum."
Unexpected delight,"My husband is not keen on museums etc., but I insisted.  We both enjoyed the wander around the Gallery.  My hubby's father was stationed in Darwin for a short time during WW2. I was interested in Cyclone Tracey."
History ,A great place not just for Tracey history but also for locale and the big bang. Well worth the visit
Museum and Art Gallery,We visited this facility as part of the Hop On Hop Off bus tour. The Sydney Nolan collection was also in location at the time of our tour. Avery nice facility that is bigger that it looks from the outside.
A fantastic art gallery.,"This is a fantastic art gallery with numerous exhibits of all sorts - a mixture of what makes the Northern Territory so unique.You can easily spend a couple of hours here.Entry is free of charge.The only downside of the place is its remote location, but a bus station is located just next to the entrance."
Unruly Days exhbition is brilliant,"A visit to MAGNT is worth it just for the Unruly Days exhbition about life in the Northern Territory from when it was taken over by the Federal Government in 1911 until after WWI. The story of the various development schemes attempted and the various characters from different cultures who lived here at the time should definitely be more widely known. I think the ""Wild West"" of Hollywood had nothing on the untamed North of Australia and learnt a lot from the various paintings, models and artefacts on show. While this was the highlight, I also had time for a look at Sweetheart the crocodile and the ongoing Moon art exhibition which were OK to fill some time in but nothing spectacular. The Museum is easily accessibly by bus from the interchange in the CBD. Entry is free and worth at least a short visit to get some historical context for a visit to the NT."
Great Variety of galleries,"happy to be out of the heat and humidity, and in lovely air-conditioning, we thoroughly enjoyed the variety of the galleries. The history of the NT was educational. The Maritime gallery was an unexpected pleasure. To see the Sydney Nolan complete Ned Kelly series of paintings was honestly awesome and unexpected. The artistic Moon themed Gallery was state of the art. A great visit."
It is free,I recently visited the Museum with my son and was blown away how excited he was exploring everything that is offered. He was fascinated by the natural history and was really taken in examining all the different fossils.
Interesting Museum,"Loved all the information on cyclone Tracey and being able to enter the booth to hear the sound of what it was like during the height of cyclone. Something for everyone at this museum from all the boats in maritime section, arts & paintings. Worth a couple of hours to look through"
Nature + history + art,"I really liked how the museum combined art exhibitions, an exhibition of the history of Darwin and a natural history section about local flora and fauna. It really gives a good summary of Darwin. The moon landing exhibition that was running when I went there also did a great job of combining science and art."
A “must” in Darwin,"What I most enjoyed was the exhibition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’s art sponsored annually by Telstra. Stunning. A wide variety of media.  It’s on display for several months towards the end of each year. The Museum part of the complex also has a good natural history selection, and a section on the damage caused by cyclone Tracy. There is a gift shop and cafe. It is air-conditioned throughout, and the wheelchair accessibility is excellent. It’s on the route for the hop on/off Big Bus, and a local bus route as well."
Darwin Museum and Art Gallery,"When we visited Darwin we spent almost a whole day in the Darwin Museum and Art Gallery, this is not unusual for us as we do like museums.  MAGNT as it is known is set in a beautiful location overlooking Fannie Bay, at Bullocky Point  19 Conacher Street, Darwin.It is open everyday from 10 am to 5 pm and amazingly it is FREE entry.The museum is quite big with lots of wonderful sections and exhibitions.It is difficult to choose the best bits as it is all so interesting. However one of my favourite parts is the exhibition about Sweetheart who was a large male, 5.1 metres long Saltwater Crocodile who lived in a waterway in the Northern Territory. In 1979 and due to safety concerns as he had been attacking boats the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory decided to capture Sweetheart and relocate him to a local crocodile farm. Unfortunately Sweetheart died during the capture. He was so well known that his body was given to the Museum where it was stuffed and preserved and is on permanent show for everyone to see and enjoy. There is a video showing attempts to capture him as well as other written information. Unruly Days territory life 1911 – 1921 is an ongoing exhibition that started on 30 June 2018 and will continue until 17 May 2020.It has some wonderful photographs of people and events from 1911 to 21. I learnt a great deal about the original Aboriginal and Chinese inhabitants of the NT and about the difficulties both the people and the authorities experienced. MAGNT has so much to offer for example all the natural history specimens, the aboriginal and local art and the large Maritime Gallery.We spent a long time in the breathtaking display about the devastation caused by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. This is set out in a very atmospheric way and the memories of it stayed in our minds for quite a time. There is ample parking outside and all the reception staff are very friendly and helpful and I totally recommend it."
Nice Museum - regional history,"I was at the museum for an afternoon. It’s really a nice museum, you get a good impression of the local wildlife and the regional history. There is also much information about the life of the Australian aboriginals.Enclosed there is also a nice small restaurant. After visiting the museum, you can go also to the beach, the museum is directly by the beach. It is very easy to get there by public transport.A little tip from me, wear a jacket or sweater in the museum, the air condition in the museum cools the area extremely down."
A Must,"We spent about 90 minutes at this excellent, modern museum and art gallery. It offers an extraordinary set up and covers a wide range of topics, from natural history to Cyclone Tracey. Stepping into the dark first exhibition hall coming from the plain sunshine and heat is already worthwhile the visit.Highly recommended."
Best museum I have ever been to.,"Wow.  Wow.  So good we went twice.  So much to see, so interesting, beautifully displayed.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  And we were also lucky to be here while the Sidney Nolan exhibition was in town.  Very reasonable price to view his collection.  The museum entry is free.   It is awesome.  And I have never seen such an amazing collection of boats.  Boats not my thing but they were fascinating.  How do/did people travel in some of those is beyond me.  The museum was brilliant."
Wide range of excellent exhibits on the NT,"It is easy to spend a couple of very informative hours in this excellent museum and art gallery. We thought it was all very well done and covered a wide range of topics, from natural history to Cyclone Tracey. It was nice to see lots of school children on visits here, as there was also much to educate and entertain them. Very highly recommended for anyone visiting Darwin."
Great information on Darwin,Loved the displays especially Cyclone Tracey and natural history. Sweetheart was a hit with our grandkids
Lots to see!,"A well presented Museum and Art gallery, You could spend a long time here. There are so may different things to see, something for everyone."
Darwin,I visited Darwin the Tiwi islands and Linchfield national park. It was the most amazing experience. I would absolutely recommend this trip to anyone who would like a cultural experience. The people on the island could not have been more friendly I loved there hospitality. Take a trip to experience the culture and amazing artists and there works. You will not regret a trip to Darwin.
Awesome! ,We love a good museum and this one is no exception. The ‘donation’ based entry fee was a big surprise and great for anyone trying to travel with young families on a budget.The cyclone Tracy section was awesome! In fact the whole experience was great! Will be back!
Good visit ,"Stopped off here on hop on hop off bus trip, free entry to most of the museum.  So me exhibits have a fee but they were closed when we visited."
Wonderfully displayed collection!,"With friends in tow I was keen to show them this excellent Museum which has a variety of displays. They remembered too well Cyclone Tracy back in 1974, and understood more clearly the terror that Darwinites experienced on that occasion. Of course Sweetheart is always a drawcard, and it is difficult not to be impressed by the size of this crocodile. Our favourite area was the collection of boats of all sizes and belonging to different cultures. An excellent Museum to visit on any hot day, as it has excellent air conditioning. Great Gift Shop offering souveniers at very competitive prices. Congratulations on sustaining such a wonderful Museum which does not charge an entry fee! Allow at least 3 hours for a visit!"
Holiday visit.,This morning we had a late start and we decided to visit this fine establishment. On arrival we had morning tea before walking at a leisurely pace around all the different types of exhibits. Everything was interesting especially having video's available to watch in the different areas of the museum. I especially enjoyed the Cyclone Tracey display. We enjoyed a nice lunch in the cafe. A very enjoyable day.
"Amazing modern ,cool ,free museum ",Love museums but this one is so modern and the displays are very well presented. Spent several hours there. Very good gift shop and friendly helpful staff.
Fascinating collection,"Loved the Aboriginal artists’ work! The collection of vintage boats & exhibit of historical photos/colonial artifacts was also extremely interesting. Overall, a nice snapshot of this region. Well worth a visit!"
A Great place to view Aboriginal Art,A very interesting Art Gallery with whole sections devoted to Aboriginal Art. Also a whole area devoted to the devastating Cyclone Tracy which hit Darwin.
"Modern, new and informative",The museum was a great experience if you would like to learn more about Darwin's history and Indigenous culture. Its a very modern museum with an easy to navigate layout. This is also a perfect option for wet weather!
Compact and interesting,A great free attraction with a great mix of classic exhibitions and art- both modern and indigenous. The air con was welcome relief.
Museum visit,"This a small museum and I say that as a positive thing. Everything is succinct and brief which makes the whole museum really easy to go through. I personally enjoyed the avaian collections and some of the fossils. It's also free which is another plus.Took us about an hour and half to wrap up. As a con, it is not close to downtown and the bus that services the museum doesn't run that regularly."
"Beautiful, dramatic displays of art and science","The moon exhibit and the aboriginal art displays were spectacular!  We also enjoyed Sweetheart, the giant (stuffed) crocodile, the mineral, flora and fauna displays, and the section about Cyclone Tracy.  Overall well done!"
Surprise Packet,"Most museums I have been to have been old, dated, and a little stuffy. The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory was a pleasant surprise and an example of what an interesting place a museum can be. Great displays all relevant to Darwin, including the very eye opening Cyclone Tracy exhibit. The art exhibitions were interesting and well laid out. The museum is the perfect size for children to keep them interested but not overly large that they get bored. Perfect location right next to the beach for a quick stroll afterwards as well!"
Well displayed artifacts,"Open every day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. except Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New year's Day and Good Friday.Free entry and parking.Although there is no lift to the second floor, provision has been made to convey those with walking difficulties on a specially designed chair.Comprehensive display outlining the history of the area with particular emphasis on the Second Wold War attacks and Cyclone Tracey."
Kool Place,"Firstly the Air Con  works well, especially when the outside temperature is 32 degrees. The exhibits are well laid out especially the Tracy cyclone section which uses corrugated iron sheeting in an imaginative way. Photographs taken after the event give a clear picture of the extent of the destruction which was vast. The cafe has a reasonable menu and good service."
Small but cultural if that’s what you’re after,"If all things indigenous and Australian are your thing then it’s a great place to visit. The history is certainly an interesting element to this place and cyclone Tracy together with early white settlers here are fascinating. Great old photos available. The maritime museum part is small and if you like that, then it may be adequate for you."
WOW what a wonderful museum ,WOW  What a wonderful museum the staff were incredible an indigenous young men on the desk was very helpful and polite and well spoken. The museum had great stories about cyclone Tracy and Sweetheart the crocodile a  lot of history with incredible indigenous art. The Air-conditioning was very strong and comfortable. Thanks for the wonderful experience.
Interesting ,"I didn't spend as much time here as originally planned, as I got around it quite quickly, but I did enjoy what was on offer. There was a lot if information and I particularly enjoyed the exhibition on Cyclone Tracy. Staff were wonderfully friendly. I noticed that they had a kids area which might be good for families visiting."
Brilliant,The museum and art gallery complex is definitely worth a visit. I was here for work and spent the morning here before flying home. The exhibition showing NT history is brilliant. The art is captivating. All round a great way to spend 2 hours. The cafe next door has great food too.
Outstanding free museum encapsulating history of Darwin and Northern Territory.,"We spent the morning touring this excellent museum overlooking Fannie Bay. A smiling receptionist greeted us with a map explaining our best tour route through a succession of well designed, described and pictured circular halls including locally produced indigenous art; -Natural History hall with Mangrove Biting Midge explained along with relationship of Hooded parrot with termite mounds, -Cyclone Tracy Hall with movie of 1974 destruction, bent steel remnant and new construction codes, -Economic Development hall devoted to farming, cattle, water buffaloes, transport, pearling, industries and labor unrest and ethnic immigration. -Maritime Hall with a score of excellently preserved historical watercraft.After using the clean restrooms, we looked in on the nice Saltwater Cafe and the gift shop. Note that a local bus stopped directly in front as we entered and exited."
Went with Darwin Tour - Tub Tours,The Darwin Cyclone display was good.Great Souvenir shop.Lovely spot for lunch.Yes it is worth a stop.I found the displays a bit boring.
Cyclone Tracey display is excellent,The museum had a great area set aside for Cyclone Tracey disaster. The dark room with the recording of the wind was quite scary. Very informative. Also nice ice coffees in the cafe.
Morning tour of Darwin Museum,"Excellent displays, great parking, lovely shop and great cafe for lunch with beautiful views over Fanny Bay."
Must see,I have been in the top end and always viit the museum at least once a year.  Well worth the effort.  Theres also a great coffee shop there enjoy
Electic Darwin,This museum is an interesting mix of social and natural history and art.  Cyclone Tracy story a must.  Other interesting parts include historical exhibits about Darwin’s early development. Allow 2 hours.  Nice cafe with great views as well.
"Charming, informative museum and gallery","We visited this Museum last week as part of the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour of Darwin and found it so interesting. It is a small museum but has a charm of its own. The section on Cyclone Tracey is very informative and you get a real appreciation of the impact that it had on this town. There are also the most fabulous aboriginal paintings. We saw a free exhibition entitled Between The Moon and the Stars (on until March 2020) which was so interesting. Some stunning photography.Also saw the Telstra NATSIAA exhibition showcasing the best of Australian Aboriginal art. Its on until early November and well worth seeing.You can certainly spend a very pleasant hour or so wandering through the galleries, the shop and the cafe."
Museum and Art Gallery Darwin,Central location. Free entry. Great for kids with interactive displays. Very good section devoted to Cyclone Tracy. Cafe out the back over looking the bay with indoor and outdoor section. Good parking.
"First trio to the ""Top End""","Although relatively small in size, is made up by what's inside. a very good variety of this related to Darwin and surrounds."
This is an excellent museum.,This museum has so many exhibits of interest that you really need to go to it more than once. As the entry is free this is easy to do. We were in Darwin for a week and we went 3 times nd still didn't get to see all it has to offer.
Great,"So far the best old school style museum I have visited in Australia in recent times. Which includes Sydney, Melbourne and the national in Canberra, all of witch have been so heavily reduced to a comic strip format for school kid visits.  The art component was extremely interesting, all superbly displayed. The coffee shop was good ."
A gem,"Great way to spend a few hours, a mix of art and other exhibits. Take no 4 bus from the interchange and then a 5 min walk past the bowls club"
Best free Museum ,Great place to have a look around in the aircon for a few hours! Great displays on the history of Darwin and Cyclone Tracey
A must see in Darwin,"The museum is well worth a visit. It has a lot of exhibits on the marine life, cyclone tragedy and the massive crocs in Darwin.Also the Aboriginal artwork is a thing of beauty."
Definitively have to go!,"Very instructive museum about a lot of things regarding the NT(aboriginal arts, fauna and flora, archeological , crocodile, settlement in the north,etc.) This museum is free and is a very nice place to spend time and to extend your knowledge about the culture,history and wildlife of the NT."
Holiday ,"Fabulous free admission and educational as well. As well as flora and fauna, early life in Darwin including natural disasters such as cyclones are exhibited. Particularly enjoyable is the exhibition featuring aboriginal and Torres Strait islander works of art."
Fantstic opportunity to learn about the NT,"A must do visit to the Museum and Art Gallery of the NT, there is so much to see you will need a few hours to see everything. I really enjoyed the Cyclone Tracy exhibit and the story of Sweetheart the crocodile. There is no cost to enter the museum and the air-conditioning is great!"
Absolute BEST ever,FREE entry! Amazing exhibits. Friendly staff. Informative displays. We had such a great time here. Highly recommend.
Northern Territory Museum and Art Gallery.,"Very much enjoyed my visit, It is informative and not to big to amble around. The dark room where the sound recording of Cyclone Tracey that ripped Darwin apart on Christmas Eve/Day 1974 is frightening. But the best part is admission is free."
Hop on get off here,"Great museum, lovely exhibits and info, also found the evacuation notices and my girlfriend was on it from cyclone Tracy"
Informative and Interesting ,Free activity- can give donation. Interesting for all ages. Great activity on a hot day as well air conditioned. Easy parking. Learnt a lot.
Well presented history,You will need a couple of hours to cover the historical exhibitions. Don't miss out on tbe maritime display of boats alongside.
Fantastic Museum,"This museum is well worth a visit.  We visited to see some Aboriginal art - which was wonderful - but there was so much to see and appreciate, particularly the history of the Northern Territory with photos of the early settlers and information on how the area has faired despite everything the weather and conditions throw at it, Cyclone Tracy exhibit really gave you an insight into how life was during and the aftermath.  Once we had finished we popped into the café where there was a great selection of food and drink."
"Modern indigenous art, local fauna","Wonderfully surprised free entry to museum, helpful receptionist provided handy map to guide us through museum.Lots of examples of local fauna as well as Darwin's most famous resident  Sweetheart.Modern indigenous art including mixed media, nothing older than about 3 years.Nice souvenir and coffee shops.Well worth at least an hour,  more depending on your interest in modern indigenous art."
Loved the Cyclone Tracy Exhibition,I must admit that the reason I wanted to visit was for the Cyclone Tracy exhibition. It didn’t disappoint! I loved it! We went through the rest of the museum too which was interesting. We spent about 2 hours there and then ate at the cafe on site. We travelled there by bus from the CBD which was easy.
Well presented Museum,We spent a quiet afternoon at the Museum.   It is well air conditioned and a good escape from the heat.    Our favourite part was the Cyclone Tracey exhibit.    We travelled there via public bus.    Very easy to get to.
Great Exhibition for All,A bus takes you from CBD right to front door. Museum is free. The exhibition of artwork on moon & sun was excellent & had lots of info boards to explain the artwork & scientific info on moon & sun. We posed several questions for our 8 & 6yo grandchildren that they had to research answers - kept them busy (mostly). V good exhibit on Cyclone Tracy & its effect. Even the adults learnt something from that. We didn't try the cafe but it looked good.
Free visit,Very interesting and free visit. Full of history and on the bus route. Highly recommend . allow at least 1.5 hours plus.
Brilliant ,"What a fantastic museum, and it's free. Loved the Cyclone Tracy and Unruly Days exhibitions. Museum is very well done, signage only in English. Nice gift shop and a small cafe. Allow 1.5hrs to see the museum, maybe longer.  Well worth the visit."
Excellent museum,2nd visit to this museum and the moon exhibit was extremely interesting. Cyclone Tracey exhibit is very imformative and very well laid out. A must visit when in Darwin
Lovely museum - worth a visit,"Well worth a visit - easy to get to, catch bus 4 on a weekend. Loved the between the moon and the stars display - lovely to hear it from an aboriginal view point. Great to learn more of their culture and respect for nature.The cyclone Tracy display was a walk bad in time, waking up to the horrible news. Respectfully done.Lovely day out"
Very interesting,"Very Good, Very Spread out, mostly wheelchair friendly. Cyclone Tracy Exhibition was very intersting"
Love coming here,"At least twice a year if not more. Its Free, it has Air con, and best of all it has ART! it has a lovely gift shop and lovely cafe too."
Interesting displays,"This small museum has excellently organised displays and information about the history of the area. It includes and integrates indigenous artefacts and art into displays about war time events, cyclone Tracy and migration from Asia and Europe. The collection of wooden vessels from nearby countries. It is easily accessible on the number 6 bus from the city."
Amazing Aboriginal Art,This museum is very well laid out and has a nice outdoor water feature with turtles. But by far my favorite part was the Aboriginal Art.  Truly a national treasure!
Small museum that could do with some funding,Visited MAGNT whilst in Darwin. It has some good displays of modern and traditional aboriginal art. With a current art awards exhibition on display. The cyclone Tracy exhibit is interesting for us older folk who remember that time. Good biological and historic displays on hand but needs a bit better signage. It’s like a rabbit warren with many subfloors. Overall an interesting place to spend a few hours out of the heat.
Museum plus art gallery,"This museum/gallery and its associated restaurant were a delightful way to spend a hot afternoon. With friends, we started with an outstanding barramundi meal at the restaurant. It was the best Barra I had on my trip to Darwin (& I tried a lot).Next was a tour of the museum, including its fascinating maritime display and its unique cyclone experience. Then one wanders into the art gallery focus area, where in addition to the standing art displays, there was also a curated exhibition. I was most impressed. There is no charge for accessing the displays."
Do not miss this!,"It took us two days to really take it all in. Amazing blend of biology, history, and thoughtfully curated art...a fully cultural experience. I grew up going to the Smithsonian in Washington DC and this now goes to the top of my list of museums!"
Excellent gallery,"We spent a very enjoyable few hours in the gallery at no cost (entry is free). Lots of varied exhibitions, we particularly enjoyed the Telstra award submissions for indigenous art and the Cyclone Tracy exhibition. The cafe/restaurant looked good though we didn’t try it on this occasion. We’d definitely return."
Excellent exhibits,"We spent an amazing 90 mins here, but could have easily spent a lot longer. We had other commitments. The exhibit about Cyclone Tracey is a must see. Very factual but also moving. The Maritime exhibit was fascinating as were the artworks. Everything was well displayed, set out and signed. Loved it!"
Brilliant Place,"Boy, what a collection and isn't it well curated! In one gallery, a collection of works ranging from indigenous art, through photography and even film, celebrated the relationship between the moon and earth. So many different angles and ideas and such quality in the artworks.Upstairs, the finalists in the Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards were of staggering quality and every turn provided new treasures. Amazingly talented people.In the museum galleries, there was such a diverse range of exhibitions. The gun exhibition is about Cyclone Tracy, which all but destroyed Darwin on Christmas Eve, 1974. Stories, pictures  and powerful video images shot by the ABC by their on the spot reporter on Christmas Day. There were excerpts from Major General Alan Stretton's diary, the man placed in charge of recovery operations by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and even a database of people evacuated from Darwin in the weeks after the cyclone. It was all very powerful but the part of the exhibition which shook you to the core was just a small room with two entry points. A small, lightless room, filled with the actual recorded sounds of Tracy as she ripped Darwin apart. Standing there in the dark, the hand in front of your face invisible and the screams of the wind and crashing of timber and corrugated iron the only sensory input ...it was unnerving.This is very clever curation.An exhibition of the early Territorians paints a picture of rugged individuals who took on hardships as though they were a new shirt.Natural history at MAGNT is an immersion in taxidermy and so many different ways of making animals interesting, especially for children. A long rising ramp of glass cases of birds and reptiles and shells and butterflies captured to attention and sparked the excitement of a succession of children as they climbed it. At the top of the ramp is Sweetheart, another triumph for taxidermy. Formerly a 5.1 metre, 760kg estuarine crocodile who terrorised fishermen in the Finniss River system fifty km from Darwin, by attacking their boats and chewing on the propellers of their outboard motors. Between 1974 and 1979, the activities of this alpha male became known across the world. Parks and Wildlife contracted two crocodile hunters to capture Sweetheart but he died after being anaesthetised.There is a fabulous cafe which overlooks the water, with a good range of food choices and which serves a very good cup of coffee.Entry to this amazing facility is free. Can you believe it?"
Loved it - Wish I had more time...,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the MAGNT.  I had definitely wanted to visit and after having done a Kakadu tour where our guide Norm also works at the Museum it came highly recommended to everyone.  I wasn't disappointed, I just wish I had allowed more time or not left it to my last day.  The Between the Moon and the Stars was fantastic reading the relevance of them both to different cultures.  There was also a lot of Aboriginal art here and it was fascinating reading the different dreamtime stories - along with this it showed pop culture references as well as a short film how the moon influences nature... Cyclone Tracy display really highlighted the devastation that it had on the city and whilst having heard about it I don't think I really understood until this exhibition.  There was also a Telstra NATSIAA exhibition which was showcasing a lot of indigenous art which was really great.  Not to forget Sweetheart the Croc and reading about his story... I spent around 4 1/2 hours there and had to gloss over some of the ""animal"" displays etc and concentrate on the more unique exhibitions that I couldn't see elsewhere.  Definitely recommend stopping in but you might be surprised by how much time you can actually spend there."
Loved it!,"Fantastic art gallery and museum.  The Cyclone Tracey information was incredible to see and read about.Also, it is free, so its a great outing."
Well worth a visit,"Very interesting covering the animals and artworks of the area, coffee shop available is you wish.  Good parking available."
Cyclone Tracey display,"Another traveller recommended we visit here for the Cyclone Tracey display, which was well worth the visit, the museum has done alot to display all fauna and flora found in the area"
Nan amazing place to see,This is a must place to see when you are in Darwin. The exhibits here are very good especially the new lower level space exhibition. The museum is free to see which is great. This is a good place for families of all ages.
Great Visit,Not usually a fan of local museums but was plesantly surprised. An excellent section on the history of Darwin and a wide variety of differnt boats that have come into Austarlia that I found fascinating
Museum not my cuppa,Probably expected too much the Darwin bombing display was excellent and the Sweetheart (crocodile) show was great but the rest of the museum for me was boring
Fantastic display!,Thanks for the collection of wonderful art and displays available for all to see. This is a well thought out set of displays and of course the Cyclone Tracy display is great and very though provoking. Well worth a few hours of viewing and contemplation.
Well worth the visit,"We enjoyed the art works immensely.  We loved the mock up of how houses looked in the 70's, the story about Sweetheart the croc was enlightening and made us sad.  Visited at the recommendation of a friend, so glad we did.  Enjoyed lunch at the cafe under the verandah, great caesar salad."
Darwin art museum,Really educational museum full records of the devastation caused by cyclone Tracey and the rebuilding of Darwin. A very interesting history of the early settlers of Darwin and the hardships faced establishing Darwin.   The indigenous artwork displayed is of a marvellously high standard with both beauty and provocative pieces on display a must see. As well as the museum there is a lovely coffee shop attached serving great cakes and luncheon meals.
Grandson's Favourite To Visit,"We started taking our grandson there when he was a toddler ,now at nearly 5 it's still a favourite when we are visiting him in Darwin ..apart from 'Sweetheart'.. he loves the monsoon gardens and spotting the turtles and of course the interactive room with  activities for kids ... always interesting and fun"
Unexpectedly good,A fabulous way to spend a couple of hours or more in a cool environment.  Great exhibits.  The staff were very informative and facilities clean and bright.
Best museum and art exhibition ,"Before you even get inside there’s a groovy aboriginal installation using recycled car parts. Go through a glass door to the monsoon garden with the pig snout tortoises. Take some time to observe how graceful they are. The 50 years landing on the moon gallery celebrates many mediums of art over the ages. It is worth a visit to see this exhibition alone. My reason for going was to see sweetheart the crocodile and the aboriginal art awards exhibition. I had seen pictures and images advertising the awards and to see the impact of this collection was extremely inspiring. Sweetheart is chilling - sad that he had to die but awareness for the dangers of crocs  is obviously an ongoing battle. The cyclone Tracy gallery was very cleverly and sympathetically done. So much to see. The marine vessels are well worth some time. Let alone the museum collection of shells, fish, snakes etc. Upstairs is the story of Darwin and NT beginnings. This gallery deserves more space as the amount of information in there was overwhelming. This is a superb museum. If I lived here I would come back at least once a year. Go for brunch, lunch and tunch! The rocky road was the best I’ve had. Even better than mine...best coffee in 3 months. Cheers. Oh and I’ve never been tempted to buy in a museum shop as much as the one here."
Worth a look.,Nice place to visit. The exhibitions  on cyclone Tracey we're fantastic and informative. Friendly staff and great coffee.
Worth it. Great!,Wonderful museum. Well set out. Loved it. A must do in Darwin and all for free   Very informative and loved the art work. They go to a lot of trouble here.
Inspiring museum,Visited MAGNT recently and saw the wonderful Indigenous Art Awards exhibition. The works were so varied and inspiring. The Cyclone Tracey section of the museum was great - amazing how quickly Darwin recovered from that disaster. MAGNT is sufficiently small not to get overwhelmed - in a 3-hour visit it was possible to see almost everything without feeling rushed. Great cafe overlooking the sea and a simple and efficient system for getting a taxi back to the hotel.
"Lots of history including for ""Cyclone Tracy"".","Lots of history around Makassan trade, indigenous art, cyclone tracy and a big crocodile that is on display.  Very interesting to see and understand the ""Top End"" rather than just red dust and kangaroos!!  There is also an outdoor cafe to sit, relax and enjoy tropical lifestyle."
Interesting museum with free entry,We were so glad we visited the museum in the afternoon to have a break from the hot sun. Lots to see and learn ... Displays are well laid out with lots of information. We were taken aback with the huge number of full size boats at the maritime section. There's a cafe on site which is very popular even with locals as the food and drinks served are top notch.
Cyclone aware,We visited specifically for the Cyclone Tracey exhibit and weren't disappointed. The blackout room where you stand and hear an original recording of the cyclone left me in awe of those unfortunate people that went through that fateful night. I managed about 10 mins in the room It was hard to even comprehend hour after hour of that darkness and noise.  We were pleasantly surprised with the rest of the gallery as well. Great interesting and well set out displays. So glad we went.
All visitors should go here!,Add this place to your list ! Very good and informative. Full size boats out back in the Maritime section. Wish we had more time.
My first stop,"One of my favourite museums in Australia. Abundant with Aboriginal art, local history and excellent location by the sea."
"Wonderful, interesting, a must do","I loved this museum!! So informative and a wonderful atmosphere. The staff were friendly, it’s well set out and so much to learn. A must see for the whole family."
A great place to take family and visitors.,"A good place to visit with friends or family. A great mix of exhibitions including art, animals and history from around Darwin and the Territory. A Gift shop for awesome souvenirs and Cafe with good food.Free entry!"
Great exhibitions,The art gallery has many fine pieces and the museum covers many aspects including a vast Darwin cyclone experience. The food and gift shop are both tops!
Holiday ,Good lots of interesting stuffGood cafeWorth a visitViews of bay nice very big crocodile stuffed of course
Don’t miss the museum!,"Don’t miss this museum - a mix of excellent Indigenous art from across the Territory, plus exhibitions about Cyclone Tracy and the boats that travelled to Darwin.  I found it fascinating, engaging and rate it as a must-see in Darwin."
What an outstanding facility - but wait there's more - it is free to enter,You need to allow a few hours to visit this outstanding venue. Entry is free and there are several displays including a comprehensive display re Darwin and Cyclone Tracy. There is currently a Moon and Stars exhibition as well as 2019 Telstra Aboriginal art showcasing the outstanding work of native works. We had lunch in the cafe outside and would have to say this is a venue that Darwin people can be so proud of.
Awesome ,Free to enter. Amazing exhibition on cyclone Tracey. Kid friendly with a hands on area just for them. Cafe has great coffee. All good types available. Grassy area for sipping coffee.
Wonderful Aboriginal art,"the 2019 Aboriginal art Telstra award is again wonderful and a must see. A very good range of skilled artistry with valued messages, Very thoughtful. I like the political images and the overall ambiance and display. At the same time, a must see is the display on the Moon and the Stars. Most relevant, congratulations to the curator. A walkaway is Tactile Arts with a wonderful pottery exhibition. Spend time searching the bookshop e.g. this time I bought the excellent children's book  Cheeky  dogs To Lake Nash and Back by Dion Beasley and Johanna Beasley. We had a good lunch at the cafe overlooking the picturesque Darwin harbour. After closing at 5pm visit the Ski Club for a drink and see the glorious sunset. If you are visiting the Museum for the first time you will experience the Cyclone Tracy - unless we act decisively on climate emergency for ecological survival, Darwin will have many Cyclone Tracys."
Variety at the museum,The Museum and Art Gallery of the NT is always worth a visit and the cafe overlooking the water offers stunning relaxing views. The art gallery has some good collections and is often rotating visiting exhibitions which means every few months there is something new and interesting.
A highlight,A great museum with a variety of exhibits. Included art works and history and a stuffed croc. We could of spent a couple of hours there. We saw other museums on our tour but this was the best (and admission is free).
History and art meet in Darwin.,"A great day out, a chance to view great art, learn about Darwin and the NT's history and relax on the deck with coffee or lunch watching the waves lap against the beach. No entry fees are charged, the staff are knowledgeable and approachable and the exhibitions such as the Cyclone Tracey display and the National Indigenous Art Award winners fascinating."
Not to be Missed,Excellent gallery full of NT's history including great exhibit of 'Cyclone Tracey Xmas 74'. Local art a highlight.Good selection of snacks/luncheons to Cafe
Part of a darwin tour,"Nice museum and gallery, fairly small and it only takes around an hour to get through. Really good info on the cyclone and also a large display of boats.  Overall a good place to visit"
Worth the look,Went to Museum and spent time viewing lots of culteral exhibits and one on cyclone tracy which was very interesting.
Love it here,"Love the shop, the cafe and thoroughly enjoyed the current exhibition. Another great place to visit in Darwin"
Well worth a visit ,It's free entry to this very interesting and well laid out museum and art gallery. The Cyclone Tracy exhibition is graphic and memorable.
Great museum with free entry! ,"Nice collection of (aboriginal) art works and animals samples. Beautiful views of the ocean from the cafe.Learned a lot, cheers to knowledge."
Well set out,"Beautiful place with an excellent variety of exhibits. Nature, arts, maritime and an haunting Cyclone Tracy display."
Darwin art Gallery,A very interesting and educational gallery. There a very interesting section on cyclone Tracy. Also a lot of original aboriginal artwork.It’s easy to spend a couple of hours here
Such history and well displayed.,"What a great display, some fabulous displays in the scientific section.. Great photos and film of the Darwin cyclone.  Fantastic coverage of the early days of NT/Darwin. Things were explained clearly and well sign posted."
Museum And Art Gallery,"Wow what a wonderful Museum, from the moment we walked in there was heaps to look at. Plenty of Artwork which was stunning and of course the great display about Cyclone Tracy. Every aspect of that fateful day has been recorded for many people for years to come. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it"
Lovely touch on Darwin and other interesting items,"Cyclone Tracey, different creatures and fauna found in Darwin and aboriginal art are able to be viewed and learnt here. Very interesting and with the visit. Is free to enter and free wifi."
Darwin art gallery ,Fantastic little gallery. Worth a visit. Don’t miss the maritime section. Great display of insects and animals. Fabulous lighting throughout the gallery. Very well done.
A motley experience,"The museum presents an array of different cultural aspects such as an amazing video on the effects of the moon on Earth, Aboriginal paintings, a wide display of Australian animals, birds, butterflies and the exhibit of a huge crocodile with the video of its capture. The entrance is free. What else can you ask for?"
Well worth  a visit!,The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory is well worth a visit. It is free and the collections are well presented in a modern format. The layout is user friendly and the reception staff very friendly and polite.
Fascinating exhibits,We were fortunate enough to visit when the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art awards were on display so we were treated to two enormous galleries filled with beautiful and moving works of art. The other exhibits dealing with NT history and natural environment were informative and interesting as well.
Great range of exhibits,"Easy to get to by local bus from the city. Free entry. The exhibits are well done with good space, lighting and quality displays. Good range of wildlife including Sweetheart, a local legend of a croc. Great story and displays from Cylone Tracy - 1974 history of Darwin. Great display of boats from pearling to recent immigration and closer nations of the Pacific. Plus indigenous art, geology and much more. The cafe serves good coffee and fresh made food at reasonable prices - try the raw cakes, the lime and macadamia was very good. You can sit inside in aircon or outside and enjoy a view of the bay."
Pretty bland,They have information on cyclone Tracey and a stars and moon thing which was brief. Ok to spend an hour in the cool though
Amazing Museum,This Museum is a must to visit in Darwin. The Cyclone Tracy exhibit is a must and the boat collection is very interesting. The animal/reptile exhibits were very well done.
Well worth a visit ,Free entry makes this lovely place even more attractive. Some wonderful displays and a great display of Cyclone Tracy (1974) which decimated the city. Accessible by bus this place is certainly a good way to fil in a couple of hours.
Excellent,We didn't intend visiting the museum but are so glad we did. It was very interesting and the displays were well presented. The cyclone Tracey exhibition was particularly interesting. We were very impressed that this excellent display was also free of charge.
Good museum,"This is a very informative museum but the highlight for me was the 'Tracy Exhibition', on cyclone tracy in 1974.  I would recommend a visit."
Interesting,This place is value for money we spent a couple of hours there just having a look around a lot of interesting things to see
Fabulous museum - need two visits to see it all properly,The Big Bus drops you off right at the door and what a fabulous museum - and its FREE ENTRY!   This would have to be the best musuem we have been to in Australia.  Great displays and reallly relevant to the region.  We needed two visits to see it all properly.  Allow at least 1 1/2 hrs to take it all in properly.
Cyclone Tracy display a must see,The main reason to go to this Museum was to see the Cyclone Tracy display. This was not disappointing and very interesting. Well presented. A good history lesson for all. Good place to go after lunch when it is hot outside!
Indigenous art awards,"I visited the MAGNT primarily to see the indigenous art awards and I enjoyed the exhibition very much. it is a great and important initiative.I also booked to attend the curator’s talk and various pop-up talks by some of the artists. These also are great and important initiatives and really add value to the awards and exhibition .The curator’s talk was moved from the theatrette to a gallery after attendees were seated. Although it was good to be in the gallery with some of the exhibits for the talk, it was unnecessary and uncomfortable to move people once most were seated. Seating in the gallery was limited - it depended on staff bringing chairs in - and this meant that some who were unable to stand were inconvenienced, at least until sufficient seats had been provided.I am unaware of any of the ‘pop-up’ talks taking place. We were told the artists were ‘too tired’.  I have no idea if this is true, but it was unprofessional, as well as disappointing, especially when this had been the purpose of my visit to Darwin."
Celebrating NT art and culture ,"We were fortunate to visit during a bonanza week for indigenous art, starting with the exhibition of the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA) at MAGNT coinciding with the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair at the Darwin Convention Centre.That said MAGNT housed a whole lot more than art, as magnificent as that was. We spent a delightful several hours meandering around a number of historical exhibitions, both natural and social, including ‘Unruly Days’ a chronicle of the absorption of the Northern Territory into the Commonwealth (1911-21) which laid the groundwork for the White Australia policy and the forced assimilation of the Territory’s indigenous citizens.Fascinating."
Great museum for all,"We both really enjoyed this museum which double up as an art gallery, all for Free( we made a donation). We both enjoyed the nature display and the exhibition on the cyclone Tracy. They also have a good cafe overlooking the water. We spend a good 2.5hr at the museum and I am not really a museum person. So really worthwhile to visit."
Great Museum!,"This is a must see if you are in Darwin, some great exhibitions of significant Territory history such a Cyclone Tracy Sweetheart the crocodile, as well as other less well-known aspects of Northern Territory history."
Cyclone Tracey & Art,Well worth a visit. As well as some fine indigenous and other art the highlight for us was the Cyclone Tracey exhibit. Photos and movie taken immediately after the catastrophe were stunning. And it’s all free.
Amazing and free!,Highly recommend a visit to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Excellent exhibits about wildlife and history and incredible works of art on display. The cafe is also great and has beautiful views over beach and gardens.
Darwin museum and gallery,We got a number 6 bus right to the door. Free entry means it's in everyone's price range. Many great exhibits including Cyclone Tracy exhibit. They have lockers to put your stuff in while you stroll around.
Excellent museum,A lot of information on Darwin and a great exhibit on Cyclone Tracey. We spent a very pleasurable 1.5 hrs here. And no charge for entry!
Great data on the hurricane that all but destroyed darwin,Great mix of neolythic skeleton and modern display of Darwin's historyFrom the big bang thru ww2 to recent hurricane damage
Eastern states trip,The Darwin Museum and art Gallery would have to be one of the best we have visited All the displays are well setup and provide extensive information this should certainly be on your things todo When visiting Darwin
Nice museum,"We came from Alice Springs where we have a nice museum there. Here in Darwin, we were expecting it to be bigger or cooler but they aren’t so different except the marine section that they have here. But overall, we liked it."
Cyclone Tracey exhibit ,This was a bit disappointing We had expected better story telling and visual effects We had a couple of hours here and enjoyed the aboriginal art
Well curated exhibits,"This is a small museum but with comprehensive displays of flora and fauna, the history and prehistory of the NT and an excellent display of Cyclone Tracey.The Moon and Stars exhibit was interesting but the room was extremely cold. Are there other art collections in the Museum? The displays about dinosaurs and fossils needs a map (maybe I missed it) to explain the location of finds. A worthwhile visit. Thanks."
"Great variety of exhibits, free entry!",This is the second time we have been to this museum in 10 years and it was just as good to go back and see the exhibits again. The cyclone Tracy section is fascinating but all the exhibits are interesting and you can easily spend a half day or more there. They have a lovely cafe too with friendly staff and great coffee. Pretty walk along the coastline too back into the city
Worthy of a visit ,Many people recommended visiting this museum and glad that we did. We only spent just over an hour here and really enjoyed the historic photos and the cyclone Tracey exhibits. Could spend a lot more time here if you wished. Also it was free entry.
strange winds,experienced the tracey winds here was like winds i have never heard before ...... the holograms were great ...... the only thing is that the gift shop should stay open for as long as the museum is.... the car doors out side were good ... got some cool pics
A worthwhile place to visit,"You must visit Museum while in Darwin to discover about early history,  and the effect of Cyclone Tracy, and many more interesting facts.  Could have spent a whole day there, allow plenty of time to  absorb.  Also have a meal there if desired, looking over the waters of the top end. Darwin is a place of many interests. Take a holiday to thee top end,"
Lovely location and beautiful art!,Situated on the edge of lovely Darwin Harbour this gallery holds a wonderful collection of indigenous art and local historical materials. Great restaurant with garden terrace!Recommend.
Great overview of culture and history,Well worth a visit soon after arriving in the top end to get a feel for the place. Could have spent a lot more time there or re visited if I'd had enough time.
Friendly and accessible museum,"Easily reached by bus from CBD ( kids free on the bus) . No admission charge for museum . Great combination of local artworks, local fauna and flora and informative exhibit on Cyclone Tracy. Shop and cafe on site too."
Great Museum and really great place for lunch and drinks,"We went here to see the museum which was really interesting. (There is a recording of the hurricane that destroyed Darwin, and a giant taxidermied crocodile named Sweatheart.) But when we ventured out to have a snack in their restaurant, we were so pleasantly surprised at the beautiful view and good food that we stayed for lunch, went out for a short walk, and then came back and had a glass of wine. It is the best place to spend a few hours. There are beautiful views of the ocean, and if you’re feeling ambitious, there are walks along the water, over to the Botanical Garden or down to the water’s edge where you can watch local fishermen return with their crab catches. Fun to watch how they maneuver their boat onto the trailer without getting in the water (there are signs warning of crocodiles and deadly jelly fish in the water!). And the food and wine are great!"
Quick but Intense visit.,What a lovely gem of a place. Beautifully laid out with some amazing pieces. The area allocated to Cyclone Tracy was incredible - all Australians should experience the exhibit particularly the sound booth which recreates the sound of the cyclone. And Sweetheart is here too - poor Sweetheart - finally left in peace. Such an extraordinary creature. The bird exhibition is also amazing.Don’t miss any of it.
Excellrnt for tge whole family!,"A wonderful museum! So much to see, do and experience. My boys loved the different exhibits and being able to see Sweetheart up close and personal. Would visit here again."
Awesome place,This is well worth a visit for a few hours to escape the heat. Good display about cyclone Tracey which shows the devastation and makes you realise the work that has gone on to make darwin as it is today. Also good display of boats from the area and the conditions they sailed in. Amazing building.
More art than history,"Good museum for those interested in art, I went hoping to learn about history but there wasnt a great deal there. Except for information on animals and the hurricane that destroyed Darwin"
Don't miss seeing Sweetheart!,"Excellent, don't miss seeing Sweetheart (giant stuffed crocodile) and info on Cyclone Tracey. Easy to get to."
A WASTE OF TIME,"I don’t know what all these people who gave this museum 5 stars saw, but me and my wife were in and out of this museum in 10 minutes. I can’t offer any suggestions, but I expected a lot more than what was in there. I feel bad for giving it 1 star out of 5, but I can’t get myself to give it any more."
Super place to kill and hour or two,"Lots of interesting photos of the Darwin Cyclone Tracy, stunning art work  Cafe was clean and tasty, great views from the balcony"
A must for Darwin visitors ,Free entry and on the bus route are instant attractions. Lots of local history and culture is accessed in a pleasant environment. Great spot for coffee etc overlooking the sea is found at the cafe. A visit here helps the visitors to Darwin gain a sound understanding of the area.
Great art and fascinating displays,This is the regional art gallery with excellent art. There is also a great exhibition of the Darwin Cyclone in 1974 with real life footage and wonderful photographs.
Small but great for kids and adults!,"Mum, in a wheelchair and I visited a couple of days ago. Easy wheelchair access and great hands on displays for kids and informative for adults. I thought the Cyclone Tracey exhibit was fantastic. And the one showing the evolution of the Northern Territory as part of Australia- couldn’t believe it took so long for people living here to get the right to vote!! Lovely eating area here too."
Ok galleria ,"The art and exhibits here are quite interesting and very NT. Enjoyed a leisurely stroll in air conditioned comfort, entertained and educated by the NT story and the indigenous birthright of of our country. However, The museum and gallery, housed in a wonderful building, could be so much more than it is. Maybe with time and funding."
Interesting museum,"An eclectic and thoughtful collection of science,  culture and art.  I enjoyed the Space exhibition and found the Cyclone Tracey memorial very touching.We went by No.6 bus and it dropped uys ast the door."
Brilliant ,Highly recommend this museum.  Fabulous displays including the cyclone Tracey and the Moon and Stars. Allow yourself a few hours.  Friendly staff including the guy (sorry I have forgotten his name) who only works on a Thursday and explained a whole heap of bones/skeletons. We went twice and enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommend.
A Wonderful Museum and Art Gallery - Well Worth a Visit,"This museum was, surprisingly, free admission.  We were impressed with the displays available at this museum, including an impressive collection of 'deadly' animals, Sweetheart the Crocodile, a collection of sailing vessels and the best cafe we've been to in a long time.  In fact it was so good, we made the effort to go again - just for the food.  The gift shop was fairly comprehensive too.  A highly recommended attraction to visit."
Beautiful art and history,"Beautiful display of art, history and concepts. The cyclone Traci exhibition is fantastic, well worth a visit for your stay in Darwin, and its completely free to visit!"
Very interesting and free.,The exhibition on Cyclone Tracy was very interesting as was the whole museum. A $10 fee for a special exhibition on Kidaki (Didgeridoo culture) was a real highlight.
Wide variety of exhibitions inside!,"I think there’s something for everyone here! Art, aboriginal art, History about Darwin, lots of natural history, ship museum and rotating exhibitionsI’m a local who goes here every few years and have never had a disappointing visit"
Confronting but amazing ,"An amazing gallery and museum even for non- museum people. The Cyclone Tracy exhibit is confronting and makes you appreciate how resilient humans can be . Listening to and hearing the actual wind footage of the day was eerily frightening , can not image actually being in it. Awesome artefacts - a great tourist attraction"
Great Free Attraction,Most historical displays are relatively young due to older artifacts being destroyed by cyclone Tracey. The museum houses many interesting artworks and sculptures. The cyclone Tracey display is excellent as is the large collection of boats from the region.
Great place to visit,Very interesting place to visit thoroughly enjoyed our time spent there and recommend it to anyone visiting Darwin
A well presented collection with Free Admission,"As survivors of that event, we went primarily to see the Cyclone Tracy display, but found that there was so much more to see at the museum.The Cyclone Tracy exhibit is sensitively presented, and captures the sprit of the times. We were comforted to think that the hardship, resilience and faith for the future of those who stayed on to rebuild Darwin after the Cyclone was remembered.The activity room proved popular with the younger members of our facility group."
Fascinating...,Got off the Hop On Hop Off bus to visit the museum. The frequency of the bus fit well with our visit. Seating while you wait. Found the Cyclone Tracy exhibit fascinating. Mother Nature at it’s scariest!We also enjoyed the maritime displays and the Transformations exhibit about the geological history and climates’ effect on flora and fauna. Worth a stop by!
Excellent museum,"Informative and interesting displays of the natural fauna and flora, and the prehistoric and historic development of the Territory, including a great Cyclone Tracy experience. Then there's the art gallery as well. Really worth a visit."
Dave & Leit Bellaart,"Awesome Visit this morning 13/7//19 Leit and I enjoyed our visit together , great experience great exhibits recommended to all 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾"
Great displays,"Love this museum and art gallery, entry is by donation. Lots of very interesting displays, cyclone Tracey exhibit is amazing and confronting. If you bring a backpack, you need to put it in a locker at the front desk. I didn't have a $2 coin for this but staff leant me one which I gave back to them when I left, so lockers are free!"
Great displays on the history of Darwin,We really enjoyed the Museum as a family and seeing the history of Darwin.  I was surprise that Darwin even become a city reading about its history.  A hard place to make a like at the turn of the century.
Museum Marvel,"...and free entry to boot! I’ll state up front that I hope all of you add a few bucks to the donation box as you walk through. I particularly wanted to see the Cyclone Tracy display as I remember this from childhood. It was a well documented area and after walking through it all was prepared to go but got side tracked with the crocodile, the birds, the bones, the incredible number of boats from surrounding shores under the roof, and most impressively upstairs, the superb photographic representation of life in the Territory at the turn of last century. You should be charging and I hope people are generous! There is also a sizeable art section, though not an interest of mine and a children’s hands on area in the foyer next to the souvenir shop.You will find the Saltwater Cafe exiting from another door with coffee, cakes and lunch/ brekky menus. A verandah out front overlooking a grassed area to the water.  Not flash but enjoyable and very busy on weekends. There was a craft market there last Sunday. Noticed the double decker red ‘hop on/off’ buses pull up here. Plenty of parking if not competing with weekend & school holiday trade. Close to Mindil Beach market area."
A great way to see Darwin's history and natural treasures,A fantastic place to learn about the history of Darwin including Sweetheart the Crocodile and Cyclone Tracy which is what Darwin is famous for.  The wonderful display of Cyclone Tracy brought back memories of watching it from afar and to experience it was great. The art gallery and the selection of Natural Museum items (from dinosaurs to bugs) is also a fantastic display for young and the young at heart.  A place not to be missed when in Darwin so allow plenty of time to explore.
great morning out,"loved the museum , to see the old boats and the the terror of Tracy the cyclone . learnt so much about the top end . a must see."
Worth a look,If you take the Big Bus day tour it stops here but luckily we had a hire car so could drive here. You can't walk from Darwin CBD. The Cyclone Tracy exhibit was very good as was the Maritime History Gallery. There is a National Science gallery but most older visitors probably go as they remember the impact of  Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve 1974. Admission is free. Outside there is a small garden with resident turtles.
Nice overview of Darwin and great temporary exhibit,"Free, nicely laid out museum that gives a great overview of Darwin's natural and frontier history. Especially liked the temporary exhibit ""From the Earth to the Moon"" that mixes Aboriginal and contemporary art, videos and other installations to celebrate 50th anniversary of Apollo Moon Landing."
Interesting for kids and adults,The museum was really interesting.The kids loved meeting Sweetheart the croc and we all really enjoyed the area dedicated to Cyclone Tracy. You can see most of it in 2 hours probably need 3 hours if you want to do it all thoroughly.
Spend time here,Very well stocked exhibits from natural history to NT eco-system to social history of the Northern Territories. Good collections of real boats of the surrounding area and countries.
Art gallery,"Took the Hop on Hop off bus down to the gallery. What a great place. So much to look at covering the bombing of Darwin history, and also Cyclone Darwin covering the devastation of both events. The arts and crafts were great and included many Indigenous pieces from local tribes. A must see if you visit Darwin."
Interesting Gallery and History of Darwin Exhibit,"Free admission, easy public bus ride from the city.We really enjoyed the museum, particularly the history of Darwin which is well displayed in the upstairs gallery.  The cyclone Tracey exhibit was good, as was the natural history section.  At the time we visited, the art gallery had only one exhibit, which was an interesting mix of science and art.A restaurant serves light meals and lunches on a terrace overlooking the harbour. Also very good."
Well worth a visit ,Just the Cyclone Tracey exhibit alone is well worth the visit. I can’t believe it’s free. Be sure to make a donation.
Worth a look,This museum is certainly worth a look if you are interested in laerning about Darwin and the NT. The staff are very helpful.The museum is easy to get to but you need to check the bus timetable if traveling by public transport.
Fabulous Indigenous Art,"Entry to this excellent museum in Darwin is free. They have displays of animals including 'Sweetheart' an impressive crocodile. There is a display depicting Cyclone Tracy, the Japanese attack on Darwin and Indigenous Art."
A must visit,Just to see Sweetheart is worth the visit. Loved the cyclone Tracey exhibit as well as the moon one. The cafe and the verandah area was very shady.
A must see in Darwin,My surprise as free entry to the museum.  So much to see and very interactive.  Great for kids too with the kids activity area.  Setting for the museum is wonderful and great just to go down and look at the water too.
Museum and art gallery of Darwin,Easily accessible by many forms of transport. Free entry with permanent exhibitions about significant events in Darwin - cyclone Tracey etc. Good fauna exhibition especially with 'sweetheart'. I especially enjoyed the Mariner exhibition.
Excellent,Really enjoyed this museum. Cyclone Tracey information was terrific. This is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours. Nice place for a coffee after too.
First stop on Hop on Hop off Bus Adventure - Darwin,Our main reason was to visit the Cyclone Tracey exhibition - it was fantastic.  Spent the majority of time in that area. Highly recommend.
Awesome work on display,"Really well curated museum and lovely staff. I visited when the moon exhibition was on, it was so interesting and a great mix of work on display, definitely one of my favourite exhibits this year. Awesome aboriginal art on display upstairs....cafe was lovely too :)"
Worth a visit,"Looking to fill a hr or to we headed to the museum. Free entry in we went and wow. The first section is like a old school museum with display after display of every preserved insect bird reptile mammal in the territory. Then there was an indigenous section,a history of Darwin area, a cyclone Tracy area, a huge pavilion of boats from traditional trading vessels to pearling luggers and more.Three hrs later we left pleasantly surprised and ""educated"".This Darwin museum punches above its weight."
"A lovely museum, well curated","We spend a leisurely few hours here and enjoyed the permanent and special exhibitions. Don’t miss the maritime exhibit “out the back”, it is delightful and wonderfully presented."
Good museum.,It was very interesting and the early history of Darwin segmentswere very informative.  I particularly liked the boats.
Lots to see,Very varied exhibitions - from natural history to aboriginal art to cyclone Tracy.   Well worth a visit.....and free entrance.
Fantastic exhibitions!,Spectacular and interesting exhibits right throughout! Sweetheart is great and the fast time film on the big screen in the Moon and Stars section is amazing.
Heaps of History,"This is a great place to spend the morning or afternoon in as it hosts a multitude of different displays .We liked the Cyclone Tracey event with it,s films and commentary from news people who were there at the time. Aboriginal and native displays were very good as well. Nice and cool inside too."
Top Spot,"We came out here for the Cyclone Tracy story, but there is much much too see so allow yourself plenty of time. An Excellent Museum and Gallery,  Thanks to the Northern Territory goverment."
Set aside a day,So much to see at this wonderful Museum and Art Gallery. Spend the time to look through all the galleries. Absolutely lovely cafe as well. All by donation (no entry charge). An absolute highlight of our trip to Darwin.
An amazing collection of Cyclone Tracey's devastation.,The museum was a great place to get a feel for what Darwin experienced during the ravaging of Cyclone Tracey. Some of the information was new to us and we are still wondering where all the people went that were evacuated? Did they all stay in Sydney and Melbourne until returning to Darwin or did they have to move to other towns and cities for the duration? An amazing feat of evacuation.
Great and informative display,Wonderful and friendly staff. Great set up with lots to see. Very accessible to all ages and abilities
Excellent museum,Free admission and excellent displays.  Worth a visit. We made it part of our hop on hop off bus tour and very glad we did.  A good place to visit.
Museum and Art Gallery of NT,Well laid put and very informative. The section of Cyclone Tracy and the collection of boats was excellent
Art by the Sea,"Nothing much has changed since my visit in December 2016.  Two new exhibits - Aboriginal didgeridoo sound and art and interviews, it was subtitled but still hard to listen to.  Also a indigenous art on the second floor.  Next door is a small textile museum of shibu  hanging and clothing."
Informative ,"Had a lovely visit with my daughter. Learnt about cyclone Tracey, Aboriginal culture, crocodiles and lots of info on flora and furna."
Great place to learn about Darwin,"there was so many different things, the Cyclone Tracey exhibit was interesting, so was the rest of the museum"
Excellent displays,"Some of the displays were excellent, in fact didn't get to see all of the displays as we had to cut short our visit. Found the layout a bit confusing and difficult working out where the displays started and ended but only negative otherwise quality of displays were very good. Please allow 2-3 hours to fully appreciate the museum. Cafe food was generally very good as well."
Excellent educational place,What a fantastic place. The displays are some of the best I have seen. Cyclone Tracy exhibition was awesome and all the wildlife too. They have a huge boat display all full size with many Indonesian boats on display. Very interesting. The cafe is good too but with elevated prices and average coffee. Generally a great experience.
A must when in darwin,"This is an amazing gallery and museum. Besides the permanent collection, including Cyclone Tracy information, the artwork and aboriginal artefacts and the natural history section, the short-term displays were fascinating.  We were very pleasantly surprised by the range and size of the place, seeing that Darwin is not a very large city."
Excellent,"I've been here before but it was amazing how much I had forgotten. Last time the cafe was under-construction, but this time we had a great lunch looking out at the gardens."
Fantasic,"It’s in a park like setting with a lovely long wide verandah where you can have lunch overlooking the water. It was really beautiful inside with very interesting displays, Aboriginal Art and a big display about Cyclone Tracy. It was very moving with film clips, audio and pictures of before, after and now. It named the people killed and all those evacuated which made it very personal. What a terrible time it was but Darwin has recovered and is a lovely place to visit."
A must see. Wheelchair friendly. ,Spent a an interesting few hours here. Very well set out Museum. Free entry!! Also a good cafe with ocean view.
Wow what a place,A very interesting place with so much to see. So many artefacts and much history including information on Cyclone Tracey. Free entry too
Darwin Museum & Art Gallery,"With a day to spare before we set off with Venture North for Arnhem Land & Kakadu, we walked up to the Darwin Museum & Art gallery, thinking we'd do that in the morning & something else in the afternoon. We came away wishing we had another whole day to spend in this unique and entrancing place. An entire room devoted to the art of didgeridoo of all types, the awe-inspiring record of Cyclone Tracey, before and after, endless works of art and displays of the night skies and mangroves, fossils, preserved creatures and marine life, the cavernous area full of boats of the past in the maritime museum. For a relatively small city this museum is a triumph, full of displays probably not to be seen anywhere else in the world. Allow a whole day, at least."
Well worth a vist,Amazing display. Easy to to have a day there to see everything on offer. Great history and displays to view.
Darwin Museum,Not bad for a small town. Haven't been in years and feel it hasn't changed much. I love the Aborginal art the most
Excellent museum,"Although only relatively small, this is a very interesting museum with free admission and an excellent and well displayed collection of Darwin memorabilia, photographs and other historical items.    There was also a very eclectic and we thought somewhat strange and mixed up art exhibition.  The boat hall which displays a number of different types of vessels relevant to Darwin's history is particularly good, with the boats beautifully preserved.  The cafe there also provided a nice lunch and we enjoyed the walk back to the city along the beach and then through the Botanical Gardens."
Very interesting and free,I was surprised by the size and the variety of exhibits on display at this museum. A free attraction that is worth a visit if you have enough time.
Indigenous art,"I popped by to visit the gallery’s  indigenous art collection. Unfortunately it’s main collection was replaced by its Moon and  Stars exhibition, which did contain a lot of indigenous art. I enjoyed that exhibition but I particularly enjoyed the indigenous gift collection upstairs. It’s particularly refreshing to see younger artists trying different styles."
One of Best Exhibits in Australia,"This museum must rate right up there as one of best we have in this country. It has great display areas including wildlife and fish, Boats that have come to the shores, history of the territories early settlers, and a second to none account of Cyclone Tracy and the devastation that it brought to Darwin and parts of the top end.   To top it all off the museum is free to visit. Easily accessed by private vehicle or for tourists, the 'hop on hop off' bus route.   There is also a restaurant attached to the museum making it a great place to visit to eat and peruse the exhibits."
Great visit,This the only museum we visited during our trip and its a great one.Information on local wildlife kept my kids well entertained. We learned abt Tracy and aboriginal all in a morning. What more can we ask.
Definitely worth a visit,"Well curated selection of Darwin’s history, boats that have come to the shores of the NT , cyclone Tracy exhibit and a great selection of indigenous art. For us just the right balance of number of items in each section.  We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and learnt a lot. Didn’t have a car and used the hop on/ hop off bus. Worked a treat. Plus a super cafe for a break or lunch. Sit on the under cover deck or inside. Highly recommend."
Best Museum in Australia,I have visited most of the museums in Australia and this is by far my favourite.  Rich in Australian history and indigenous culture.  The cyclone Tracey display has been my fave for over 15 years.
Plenty to take in,"Give yourself plenty of time to walk through, sit and listen, read exerps from newspapers about Cyclone Tracey, and so very much more. We had a light lunch there before we started which helped. A must see"
Went for the cyclone simulation and got so much more.,"What an excellent museum/art gallery.  We had aportioned 1.5 hours but I could have easily spent the entire afternoon there.  I nearly missed out on the back section - possibly more signage to the history and maritime sections is required - which contained some fantastic archival photos of Darwin's beginnings and a great assorted of seagoing vessels, all beautifully displayed."
Must see ,"The Tracy exhibition is a must to see,it tells you all about Darwin before the cyclone and photo’s of the damage it caused. There is also exhibition of houses on the way people lived back in those days."
A must do it Darwin. ,This museum is really good. I loved the cyclone Tracey area. I couldn’t believe it was free. This museum is a must do if your in Darwin
Take your time,"Visited the museum on our hop on hop off double decker bus tour,very interesting and informative exhibitions especially cyclone Tracey give yourselves an hour at least ,Recommended"
Great exhibits. Worth a visit,We spent 2-3 hours at the museum and it was well worth the visit.  The cyclone Tracey exhibit was a real eye opener. There was a temporary exhibit showing a time lapse video of nature and it was superb.
Interesting exhibitions,"We spent a couple of hours wandering through the exhibitions.  The main display brought together art and science in relation to the solar system, and was very interesting.  We also enjoyed the historical exhibition covering the earlier years in the NT.  The photographs were fabulous.  Overall we thought the displays were very professional.  Afterwards we had lunch in the cafe sitting on the terrace overlooking lovely gardens.  Great."
Spend a couple of hours here,"Museum opens at 10am, in two hours you'll see the lot.Nice museum with plenty of info and good displays.Recommended"
Lovely musuem,"Excellent small museum. Free entry and very good mix of Darwin history exhibits with excellent  species exhibits, good economic history and very interesting display of regional  boat and canoes."
A quality museum,"Excellent displays and local history, including Cyclone Tracy exhibit. Loved the pioneer life area and pleasant surprise to come across some maritime exhibits as well. All nicely presented in modern facilities."
Nice but unspectacular,Not the largest exhibition around but some interesting displays and nice aboriginal art. Lovely outlook overlooking the water. Good coffee shop with a small selection although a bit pricy.Can do the entire exhibition in about one hour.The price is perfect - free!
Very interesting museum,Free entry and open daily. Well put together museum and galleries. You can Lear a lot about the native wildlife and the cyclone TRACY exhibit was very well done. Make the time and learn a little about the top end.
Boats Cyclones & Spiders,"Cyclone Tracey was big news all over Australia at Christmas 1974, we couldn't believe how bad the devastation was. People smuggler boats, fishing boats and family boats, an eclectic mix. Spiders of Australia was an eye opener. Some cute as well as deadly critters."
Excellent,I spent an hour or two here visiting the exhibits including Cyclone Tracy and the “Moon and Stars” exhibition.  This is a wonderful facility and the creativity of the exhibition was mind blowing.  As I wandered I frequently encountered Norm who had met me when I arrived.  His passion for the museum is inspiring.  I shall return.
Good Displays,There is lots to see and the displays are well presented. Allow about 2 -3 hours if you like to read all the information about the various displays.
Excellent presentation of Cyclone Tracy ,We saw a post Cyclone Tracy hologram and very authentic film about the cyclone. Good cafe there with indoor and outdoor tables.
