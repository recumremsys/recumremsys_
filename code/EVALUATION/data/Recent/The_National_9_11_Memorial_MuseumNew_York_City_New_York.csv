touching memory,"It is good to go now when there are not that many tourists so you can take in the place and engage with it, especially the two pools on the sites of the towers. Very tender to see flowers in the names of people who died there."
Very moving,This was a must see on my list for our trip. The memorial and Museum go about their purpose with dignity and respect to the tragic event they represent. It was everything I expected and more. The museum is well worth the admission fee and is very close to One World Observatory if you choose to make a day of it!
Historic,"We had loved our visit, we were with a small group and a lovely guide, to visit without hesitation and with a guide it is even better"
A wonderful and respectful memorial to a tragic event,"Having watched the events unfold on television, this was top of the list of things to do in New York City.  We arrived at the ticket office quite early, but there was still a queue, though this did move quickly.  I was amazed by how wonderful and respectful this memorial was to not only the event itself, but to the lives lost in this tragedy.  There were plenty of police officers on duty to ensure everyone's safety and to protect the memorial.  Well done to those who created this and to the volunteers throughout the memorial who give incredible insights into the events of the day.  Be prepared to be moved by your visit."
9/11 Exhibit....A Must See!,"What can you say here that hasn't already been said?  This place is excellent, very tasteful and respectful for the events that happened here.  We were very moved by the actual exhibits and the waterfalls, with the names of all the victims in marble along the edges."
Just powerful emotions when coming here!! ,"This memorial is definitely a must see when visiting New York City, whether your coming from another state here in the US or another country.. The emotions you experiance are on another level. I personally do not have anyone that passed away from this tragedy but I have friends family who have and prayed for them. The museum did a great job of laying everything out with thousands of videos, pictures, and sculptures of what happened on 9/11. R.I.P."
911 Anniversary ,Never forget the ones you served and the ones who lost their lives 19 years ago today.  This is a very nice memorial.
Interesting museum,This new museum brings you right back to that day with multimedia displays of events. It is a very emotional experience!
Get a guided tour ,The immensity of the tragedy is so hard to comprehend but our guide was excellent. His personal memories of that awful day were touching. The projections of ‘missing person’ posters really hit home. This is an excellent museum and a fitting memorial to those who were lost.
Amazing but eerie,"Such an emotional yet amazing experience. There was so many articles, voice notes and even debris from this horrific event. Leaves you a bit speechless after you've left. Definetley something you should visit if you have an interest in history or if you just want to experience it."
Best NYC attraction,"High recommend the 9/11 memorial! Definitely the best thing we did in NYC. The whole journey though the museum is totally soul-touching, you nearly feel part of it all."
Stunning tribute and really worth going.,It’s such a overwhelming experience to do. So much thought and preparation had been put into it and it really shows. I’d recommend going to anyone visiting New York even if it’s not your first time. Not overly priced and very humbling experience.
"a long wait, but worth it","As we did not purchase entry tickets before we went, we had to queue for hours to get ours, which then gives you an entry time - ours was 4 hours later - and then you return at the correct time and allowed in. Once inside, it is eerily quiet, mainly out of respect for those who suffered.Well worth the visit, even the wait for tickets in the rain!"
Never forget ,A must see and stop to pay your respects for all of our fallen who made the ultimate sacrifice. Amazingly beautiful and well maintained and clean with Covid restrictions.
Never Forget,"I will never forget where I was or how I felt on September 11, 2001.This museum brings you right back to that day with multimedia displays of events as well as personal accounts of those affected. Our early March visit had hardly any lines and plenty of room to see all that the space had to offer. It is a place of reflection and solemnity as well as learning."
A Must See,This museum is a must see if you are in NYC. It is definitely raw & emotional but it was a really nicely done museum. A great way to learn about the many events of 9/11 and honor those who paid the ultimate price. I would 100% recommend.
Heartbreaking Memorial.,The emotions in the air in the Memorial are palpable.  The 9/11 Memorial is sacred to the memories of the souls who perished.  I found it frivolous and disrespectful how visitors pose for selfies gleefully.The sombre memorial is a reminder of how dangerous fanatic thoughts can become if not checked in time.
Must do,"To be honest we weren’t sure whether to go to Ground Zero.  Did we want to go and see the site of so much destruction and misery?   Of course it is a chilling place but we are pleased that we did go and see it.   It was a moving and appropriate memorial.   What brought it alive was the guide we had who told us stories of individual acts of heroism.   To be honest, I don’t think you can comprehend a vast number of people passing but you can comprehend one person such as Todd Beamer on Flight 93.   Seeing his name and being reminded of his story bought tears to my eyes."
So sad ,What a sad place but such am amazing place too to have the ability to pay my respects to this from this shocking act and remember it when is as just a mere 16 years old thinking it was a movie at first them to learn it's real life broke my heart glued to the TV for days after it and stating then I will one day get my chance to visit and pay my respects to have done that now and to see all the names and the photos of all it's just scarily shocking to witness the destruction this caused to buildings as well as human life they way this site is now set out is lovely and serves a perfect peaceful site to spare a prayer and thought to all who was lost thank you America and thank you NYC for this chance
Ripped off,"We prepurchased entrances to the 9/11 Memorial Museum for our trip to NYC in November. They were 2 senior tickets for Tuesday, November 5, 2019. The Booking Reference was BR-734625478. When we arrived at the entrance we were told our tickets were NOT valid. We were told this happens frequently. After venting our frustrations we were forced to spend $40 more in order to enter. I attempted to contact Trip Advisor when we returned from our trip to obtain a refund, but never received a response. I do not know where to turn now."
To never happen again ...,I have no comment on the feeling we experienced.  We sympathize with the families and friends of those who have lost their lives in such a cruel and unreasonable way.  I hope it never happens again
Very Emotional,"As a native NYer who lived through 9/11 this museum was very emotional. It portrays many aspects of 9/11. You see firetrucks crushed, portraits of people who were lost on the planes. Memorabilia of ppl who passed that day. You can listen to calls made by people who passed, graphic videos of people.  If you are a true historian this is the place for you. It was too gut wrenching i dont think that I will return."
Sobering Experience,"Well worth a visit if you're in Manhattan. It's a very sobering experience, plenty to see, could spend hours here (I was time limited unfortunately). Large variety of exhibits and stories."
Atmospheric & moving,Probably the most amazing Museums i've ever been too. The whole experience was intense & moving. Well worth a visit.
"Amazing, emotional insight into 9/11 - Must do.","Visited this museum twice now on 2 separate trips to NYC, such an emotive place and really hits home how horrific the events of that day must have been. This will forever be remembered in history, and therefore I took my son with me who is 12, he really was so fascinated and learnt so much about the history of these events. There are areas where cameras are allowed and areas where they are not. This museum takes a few hours to get round but is so worth taking the time to do this.Definitely a must do on anyone's NYC itinerary."
Beautiful Memorial,"I think that everyone should come here, not only for the wonderful experience... but for the victims and family of those who passed due to 9/11."
THOUGHT PROVOKING.,"Went here with again pass,queues not too bad (time of year).The exhibitions are all very powerful as to helping us non Americans try to understand just how bad that day was. It is all presented very respectfully to all the fallen and their families.I found it all very moving.The 2 pools on the site of the towers are absolutely stunning and a wonderful memorial to the people lost that day.Well worth a visit ."
Moving experience ,A very moving experience. Seeing all the names of those who tragically lost their lives in this horrific event. What is noticeable is how quite it is just walking around the memorial. Never let us forget
9/11 Memorial and Museum,I had been there a yr after it was a hole in the ground and to see all that was there and the memories collected.  It was amazing to see.
Breathtaking and Sad,"We visited in the first week in July 2019 and it was breathtaking, the memories of the fateful day is unbelievable"
Amazing,"Very emotional, but a great museum with lots to learn. I would definitely recommend going here if you are in New York"
Wow,This was so beautifully done. From outside at the fountains to the memorial walls inside and everything in between this is such a thoughtful and emotional tribute and memorial. Everyone needs to see this.
"Amazing, but also soo sad","an absolute must on a trip to New York, we spent hours & could have stayed longer, very much an eye opener"
9/11 museum,I Was a little disappointed with the lack of artifacts....we have been following this event from the beginning and knew most of the info...we also found it to be very spread out and felt it had a lot of unnecessary walking....It is a beautiful building right in the middle of the area...good to see some of the material you saw on tv with the recovery...not too much guidance to follow...no tour guide.   However would advise  anyone going to NYCity to do this area....very touching however...glad we did go to it
Visiting the cty,If you are visiting the city this location is a must. There is a lot of history here that is going to be remembered for a long time in American history.
Unforgettable and Reflective,When you visit the sight you will see many heroes and the tragic loss of life.  This is a very humbling experience and should be viewed as such.  There are many personal items on display and one section that you are asked not to film or photo graph.  Be respectful at all times because you don't who is visiting the memorial and could be grieving the loss of a loved one.  It is amazing that there were not more lives lost.  After visiting the memorial never forget what you have seen and don't take your daily life for granted.
An emotional experience and ultimate remembrance of those who lost their lives in the September 11th attacks,"An incredibly emotional tour which takes you through the timeline of events of the September 11th attacks. The tour contains many objects from the fall of the twin towers, a very informative trip. A must see remembrance experience."
Tasteful,"The whole area of ground zero has been preserved and rebuilt in such a tasteful way to honour the victims. I was moved to tears both outside amongst the locations of the towers and throughout the museum. Out of respect I felt I couldn't take any photos within the museum. To me it wasnt a tourist destination for selfies and poses and memories, but a time to remember that fateful day and the horrors that America went through, particularly New York. Seeing items belonging to victims and damaged vehicles and pieces of buildings brought the images I saw in 2001 to life. I cried that day and I'm not ashamed to say, I cried all the way around that museum. Sadly some people were disrespectful, one man stood on a bench (a surviving one from the plaza) to take a photo. The staff quietly asked him to get down. Unfortunately, likes and shares have created selfishness in people. I wouldn't have a go at anyone taking photos down there but some forget that this place is basically a mass grave. I would recommend a visit and dont be ashamed to get upset. It's amazing how many people were. The only part of the museum I refused to acknowledge was the part about the terrorists. I did not care about any information about them. I understand why it was there and I have no complaint. But to me, it didnt deserve my time. Thank you to all involved to make this museum. You did a fantastic job in honouring the lives lost."
Lest we forget!,Visiting this museum made me feel as if I was reliving the day again. Really felt a massive sense of lost but I would say that if you visit New York City and don’t visit here you’ll be missing out. The museum is absolutely amazing is all I’m trying to say.
New York City trip,"Great experience. Very informative and truly humbling, I still remember I was in 7th grade English class when it happened."
NYC 9/11 Tour,"This was the thing I was least interested in seeing when we planned to visit NYC but it was amazing. It was so informative and in-depth, it had so much going on, video clips, screen shows, facts to read on the walls, memorabilia...it showed a real insight into the exact events as they happened that day. I was in fact at school when that happened and to hear and watch it on the news from the UK was nothing like the information you got on this tour. Definitely would recommend."
Nice tribute,There are two lines.  Buy your ticket online and only wait in one line.  You can spend many hours if you read all the signs and listen to all the talks.   Very nicely done.   Rooms were very crowded at times making it hard to get close to areas.
Far better than I thought,"Visited Ground Zero and a little sceptical as to what it would be like but very impressed with the experience. It brought back the memories of the day. It was tastefully done, the right balance of informative, thought provoking and spiritual.  Give yourself a few hours but also recognise that for those that did not remember the day (albeit from the office in the UK) it may not have a lot of meaning - but like the WW1 memorials - it should and the museum and whole ground zero experience should help share those memories with the next generation"
A must see,"If you do anything in New York, go here. It makes you stop and think. Allow enough time as it is on different levels. The only down side , which sounds petty is the cafe could be larger. Please go and see this museum."
Sightseeing,This is a must!Very spectacular but emotional at the same time. I love how patriotic the Americans are and how they have invested in that part of Manhatten.Would go back again.
Just humbling,"This is one of the most humbling experiences and something you want to take your time walking around.It has been done is such an authentic way and respectful to those it affected.There isn't a great deal you can write about this to be honest, as you know what you are visiting and why...All I would say is, it's humbling, moving and very very well thought through.....#Respect"
Blessings for the sacrifised,Our group of 9 travelled to NYC in end of Jan and early Feb. We are from Tibet/China. We were deeply impressed by this great country and the great people. this site is with great location and great to come. and many blessings go to the people sacrificed... will come again in the future and wish USA go back to normal soon after the invisible enemy of COVID19 disappears.
This was the best thing I did in NYC!,"This place is haunting, captivating, humbling and truly amazing. Words cannot express how powerful this tour is. Do not skip this on your NYC visit!"
Respectfully Done,"My daughter took me there for the first time, and I was so touched by the way it was all put together and honored the lives that were lost that day. I will never forget what I saw. TY"
Historical - Must see!!,"Always visit here at the holidays with out of towners, relatives and friends. Although I could give the tour by heart, much better taking the Official. More Celebratory and majestic. Plan to spend a minimum 2-3 hours to take everything in."
"Solemn, Instructive, Informative Must See","A treasure of pictures, memorabilia, artifacts, and videos showing the event of 9/11. An awesome place on the very site of what had been the World Trade Center towers."
Great Experience,The designers and architects did a wonderful job on this memorial museum.  It really tells the devastating story of that day. Would recommend getting the tickets online so you don't have to wait in line.
A tragedy very well memorialized.,"Very well laid out.  Expect to spend more time than you think inside the museum.  So much to look at and read and absorb the immense loss of life that occurred there. The amazing job the curators did shows in how everything is presented and displayed.  To everyone who had a part in getting this planned and implementing the reality I commend your courage, persistence and gratitude.  Do not visit the city without this visit.  Please visit the memorial fountains outside too.  Very loving tribute to those that lost their lives that day."
New York 2019,"Visited during my trip in November 2019.Very informative, felt so sad for the victims of this awful event.The museum has artifacts from the tragedy and tells the story from start to its tragic end.You must visit if you can."
Very moving and thoughtfully done ,"The museum is beautifully curated, with sensitivity to the people and the content being covered. The only point I would raise is that it’s not got one way of going round, and so it was hard to know we had definitely seen everything inside, due to the layout."
"Just the most amazing, overwhelming place","Like many others across the world I knew exactly where I was when this dreadful tragedy happened. Going to New York and visiting here to pay my respects to people that I didn't know or had no connection with was just an absolute necessity. Lots of people milling around in the quiet contemplative environment. I didn't listen to the final recordings of people, I just felt that it would be too upsetting. Well worth a visit to celebrate the survivors, the grit of the New Yorkers and the heroism of the emergency workers. Expect to shed a tear - I certainly did."
Very Sad,So glad i came here. A very sad experience but also very interesting. Well worth a visit. It certainly makes you think. Some of the exhibits are just mind blowing.
Overwhelming,"People had warned me that this was going to be quite a harrowing experience, but I couldn't not go and pay a visit. Compared to the tranquility and peacefulness of the beautiful tribute fountain right outside, I'm afraid that I can't recommend the Museum and in fact, I wished I hadn't gone (hindsight!). There were some heartwarming & meaningful tributes, but the majority was gaudy, garish and tacky. People were listening to crew/passengers' final messages to loved ones from the cabin, videos of the planes hitting were being replayed on a loop on a big screen and there was debris from the ground on that day on display. This is not to mention the whole distasteful section on terrorism. It was a pleasure to have visited and pay our respects of course, however I think they could have made the museum so much more tasteful and respectful."
Words can't express,"I was 11 when 9/11 occurred.  I remember my Spanish teacher came into class and said,""This is a sad day for America.""  My classmates asked her if we were at war.  She just told us to go with her to the library.  I saw both Twin Towers on fire.  Then, the news of the Pentagon and the crash of flight 93 came on.  This museum had amazing artifacts and brought back memories of that tragic day. The fire fighter truck stood out because it was smashed because of the collapsing towers and seeing the watch from a passenger on flight 93 and the time being stopped at 10:03 when the plane crashed was powerful. I was absolutely at a loss for words exploring this museum.  This is an absolute in New York."
Must Experience,"A must see. We spent about 3 hours here and it gave me a whole new perspective of that day. I won't tell you much about it because in my opinion, it is something that you have to experience in person to better understand. Plus, it felt right paying respect to all of those who fell victim."
A place to pay your respect if in New York,"Even though we have seen all the footage of that terrible day we still felt the desire to go down to the museum to pay a form of respect to all those who suffered. Time has passed and it felt a little commercialised with people pushing to sell magazines of the terrible day and groups of young people laughing and taking selfies. The museum itself was well organised and displayed a lot of what we have all seen over the years, but it still made you feel the sadness of that awful day. Would not want to go again but glad we went"
Amazing tribute,This is so well done.  It is an amazing tribute to such a tragic event.  It gave us a real insight of the events and the lives lost but never forgotten.
Impressive & Sobering,"I had visited the museum a couple of years ago, but hadn't allowed enough time on that visit to thoroughly read and absorb the exhibits. If you want to have time to thoughtfully explore the exhibits and read most of the signage, allow at least 2 hours. If you're obsessive about reading everything, allow even more time. We visited on a winter weekday day when it wasn't very crowded, so were able to proceed at our own pace. The museum is very well designed, with a minute-by-minute explanation of the events of the day, video interviews, photographs,"
Sombre,"I would recommend visiting this museum and memorial, we all know what happened that day and how it changed the world as we know it. I came away feeling emotional and sad, it really hit home all over again what had happened. The museum has been cleverly curated and is somewhere we should all visit."
A Must Visit When In New York,There cannot be many people who don't recall the sombre events that led to the creation of this museum. That said however the experience of walking around the museum is a really great experience. I went with my wife and a couple of friends and shortly after entering the exhibits we ended up going in different directions. There is so much to see and so many personal stories and information that make this living exhibit quite a moving experience. I was lost in thought the whole time I  was looking around on my own for a number of hours before our group came back together before leaving. Your are actually at the location where something that changed the whole world happened and the whole experience in my view has done justice to those that lost their lives at the same time as reminding the rest of us who visit what was lost on that day. The one striking thing about the visit is how quiet it is even when its busy.  Great value for money and despite the subject quite an uplifting experience.
Check it out.,"A truly powerful place. Prior online booking allows you to pass the long queue. Don't be lured by bracelet offered for donation: near the exit, there's a visitor center with lots of merchandise. A must-visit."
Very interesting,"Wow, what can I say. This museum held so many witness accounts and artefacts from that dreadful day. They were all preserved very well. There were plenty of staff monitoring the use of photography and directing you to the cafe, toilets etc. This was a HUGE museum with plenty of slideshow exhibits. This attraction was part of the Explorer Pass which we had pre-purchased so we did not pay."
Well worth a visit,Visited here recently.It was a very moving and emotional visit but well worth doing.The whole place is very well laid out and everything very well explained and documented giving a real understanding of what it must have like for the rescue workers and the mayhem that was in the city at that time.There is a cafe on the upper floor although small but good for a cup of coffee and a cookie.
9/11 Memorial & Museum,"What a fantastic place to visit, the memorial is actually very poignant and on the birthdays of the fallen they put a rose next their name so lovely. In the museum you can spend a good 2 or 3 hours just walking about and experiencing the interactive displays and all the mementos to that terrible day. A must do in NYC"
WOW!,"This memorial is so painful and beautiful at the same time.  Well worth going and experiencing, but be ready for a full range of emotions."
Poignant,"the 9/11 Memorial is free - it is absolutely beautifully done - so simple and yet so impressive.  definitely stirs up the emotions the Museum is heartbreaking.  the guided tour was a little disappointing.  you can probably find a lot of the information online, but you do get to see the exhibits if that is of interest.don't miss the survivor tree near the memorial - everyone need a bit of hope !"
Fire truck,Very impressive to get a impression of what people must have been through that terrible day and far beyond.Alle those personal stories are heartbreaking . One that struck me most was the story of the fire truck that is half melted. Listen to the story that's behind...
Disappointing,"I did not want to visit this museum, since I was in NYC during 9/11, however my brother wanted to go.  The first thing that disappointed was the $8.00 fee they charge for the audio tour.   The next disappointment was the museum itself.  If you've watched the numerous documentaries on 9/11, there is nothing new to see here, except crushed fire trucks and other equipment.  It is really sad to see personal possessions recovered from the ruins on display."
Canceled due to virus. No response from vendor for refund!,"We arrived on the 12th and I learned that the 9/11 Memorial was going to be closed for an undetermined amount of time, due to the virus concerns, on March 13th (day we had booked). Sent emails to vendor(tickets purchased via TripAdvisor website) but no response. Still waiting as we are due a refund!This is in no way the fault of the museum. 100% on the vendor for not responding to our emails or automatically refunding everyone's tickets once it was known that the museum was going to be closed! . Will be proceeding by filing a complaint with my cc company and contest the charges!"
Free admission - National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,"We went to see the 9/11 Memorial & Museum on 3/10/2020. The memorial is free but this particular day, admission to the Museum was free though you needed to get there at 4 pm and line up for an admission ticket. The free admission to the museum started at 5:30 pm.I was really surprised at how many many people came and from where they came from. There were really so many foreign tourists there to see the museum. It really brought back so many memories of that day but also showed so much more detail that we had never seen or heard of before. There were recordings of conversations from the passengers on the flight that went down in Pennsylvania as they discussed how to overcome the hijackers, accounts from first responders, from people who were in the towers. There were exhibits of remains from the building, the recovert equipment, artifacts from survivors and victims. It really was a lot to take in but definitely worth the time. We thought that the museum would be closing at 9 pm that day but it turned out to close at 8 pm. We spent 2.5 hours but could not finish by the time they ushered us out of there."
A somber place,It was one of the most poignant memorial  I have ever been to. Eye watering few hours in there.How can any human being inflict such kind of atrocities on human being.Saddened to watch the family members video.It was mind blowing.Barbaric people those perpetrators were.
"Very emotional, but Excellent experience","This is a must see when you visit NYC. I would definitely recommend a tour guide for this attraction. Allison did an exceptional job explaining sites as we toured, including personal experiences she went through on 9/11."
Nostalgic!,"If you haven't been in 9/11 Memorial, you must go. Really hard to explain the feelings even my son 6 years old was curious about it. Totally recommend it!"
Must visit place,"During our visit in New York, we decided to visit 9/11 place with memorial museum. Entire area is fullfiled with sadness so while being there, be serious, be quite and behave properly. Museum is really huge, items are well-described and breath-taking. It's a modern museum with many interactive things. If you are really interested in the history of this tragic moment, you don't need a guide. Everything is well described. My wife and I spent there 4 hours to see everything. You can skip the entire queue to the ticket booth and buy it in self checkouts machines (cards only). Really worth to visit!"
A must see for a huge part of history ,This place is such a huge part of recent history that is is a must see when visiting new york. Every bit of display have been well thought out and it details so much that happened that day while still be very respectful of the people who passed and their family members. Some sections are very emotional so I would recommend taking tissues just in case.
Very moving and thoughtful memorial,I didn’t expect to feel so emotional but this memorial took my breath away. Such a thoughtful memorial for all those poor souls who lost their lives on 9/11. The enormity of the water disappearing into the vast holes was overwhelming. We didn’t visit the museum itself but just watching and walking around the site was enough to absorb the sadness of those victims. Another place to visit is the little church close by where the firemen and volunteers sheltered in between the mayhem.
A must do,"We visited the memorial location and then went into the museum. We had been told by others how much of an emotional visit this could be but would definitely be worth it. We can both remember the awful events of that day, which when walking round seemed like yesterday. The pieces they have chosen to display are all very respectful and really help people who don’t remember it understand what happened. The only bit I didn’t like was the sound of all of the firemans alarms going off. I went round that bit quite quickly. Overall something everyone should do, I just wish we didn’t have to."
A fantastic memorial.,This is a must see in New York. Admittedly it can be harrowing but the museum has done an amazing job of producing a wonderful memorial.
9/11 Museum,There are two lines. 1) to buy ticket and then 2) to go through security. Both lines are outside and both can be long. I went in February and it was cold. So using this ticket allowed me to skip one line which I was grateful.
Outdoor tour through Viator.,"Walked all through the financial district, but this was the most meaningful spot for me. Very moving to be in such a hallowed space."
Courage and heart,"If you only visit one museum of memorial in NYC, this should be it.  It is so moving to understand what courage those first responders displayed.  It’s a must each time I go to NYC — it makes me proud to be an American."
Incredible ,"We took our teens on a visit to NYC and visited. Powerful, beautiful, desperately tragic and a great visual story of 9/11. We all learned so much and felt the tragedy and loss. Thank you."
Heart rendering and beautiful. ,This area is truly hallowed ground that must be respected for its importance in our American history. The museum a bit crowded to be expected well worth the wait and time you need to explore.
absolutely mind-boggling,"get there as early as you can.  get your tickets in advance.  be prepared with comfy shoes.  you may need tissue as well.  if you were alive on that day-it will all come back to you.....if you were not, you will witness a very sad terrifying moment in USA history.  Be prepared"
Should not be missed if in NYC,"If visiting NYC and can only visit three places, it must be the Statue of Liberty, Times Square and the 9/11 Memorial. Too bad we cannot make this required for all - but everyone should go. Very emotional being there."
Still Too Soon ,Such a powerful and emotive memorial. Bring your tissues with you for when (not if) you shed a tear or two. This is a must to visit when you are in NYC and your respects to those who lost their lives on the day that changed the world forever.
Interesting and very moving memorial,"I visited the museum as part of a trip to New York. The memorial fountain outside is striking even if you don’t want to pay to go into the actual museum. For the size of the museum and similar museums I have been to I thought the price was very reasonable. Although it is a very deep and moving experience I thought it was very tastefully done and incredibly detailed. The central exhibit did get quite busy so I was shoulder to shoulder at times, which made it a little difficult to see some exhibits. It would maybe have been better if they had held some people back to limit the crowd in here. As someone who didn’t know the detail behind the events of 9/11 I wanted to learn and pay respect at the same time, and overall I left feeling very humble and impressed at the quality of the museum."
To do,"It is a large museum with many exhibitions, it is possible to find many guides and it is really very good"
A respectful and informative place,We felt this was a moving tribute and memorial to the events of 9/11 and shows the strength and positivity of the local people and wider community to come back after such abhorrent events. It is worth a visit to reflect back on those moments and to take account if the thousands of lives affected by those hours of madness. It is historically interesting and non sensational. It is a memorable place to be.
Really interesting,It is free entry on a Tuesday from 4.30 pm we queued up at 3.30pm and got in no problem at all. We found the whole experience very interesting 1.5 was long enough for us. We didn't do it all there is so much to see and so well displayed.
Moving Experience,"Amazing museum!!! There is so much to look at, listen to, read. We spent four hours walking and looking around, and could have easily spent much more time. It is eery, yet eye opening to walk through a museum focused solely on an event that you have lived through. Seeing all of the details played over from that day is an humbling experience. I highly recommend visiting early in the morning, it gets crowded fast. We arrived at opening and thirty minutes later, there were 20 people surrounding each exhibit. Plan to spend a little extra time due to crowds, there is so much to see and do."
The Ideal Learning Experience for Out-of-Towners,"The 9/11 Memorial Museum tour helps give people seeking to learn about the tragic events that transpired September 11th, 2001 an opportunity to do so walking on the dark grounds of what remains."
Excellent tribute museum,Don’t be put off by thinking this is an emotional experience it was truly an amazing museum. We paid around $45 for the audio tour well worth it so you know what you are looking out and story behind it. Arrived at 9am to no queue and venue has a cafe as well and cloakroom is free to store heavy winter jackets and rucksacks (note that I had a thermal on and top and was quite cool walking around). Young lady who took us around was very informative and explained about everything well worth the extra as otherwise don’t think the exhibits tell you much.  8 of us on the tour all felt it was well worth the extra.  This tour was just inside though you can pay to be shown around the outside too but we did 9/11 survivors museum tour where an actual person affected by that day takes you round $35 and Chris our guide was on the 82nd floor in North Tower when the first plane crashed into 93rd floor. Anyway back to the museum.  After the guided tour you make your own way into the story of 9/11 about the whole day from start to finish including the terrorists and people who lost their life’s and the lessons learnt from terrorist attack in 1993.  Very very interesting. Also a bit about rescue dogs but we didn’t do that as 3 hrs in we had read enough.   If you carry on outside the museum past ohares Irish bar and keep walking the survivors museum is 5 min walk on right hand side great deli opposite for lunch or breakfast and cake.
Such a moving place,"On our last visit we did not do the museum as it was the anniversary of 9/11 and very busy, this time we made sure we experienced the museum. Such a moving place. You have to visit the museum when in New York , it’s so moving"
Moving and wonderful in equal measure. A masterpiece of commemoration and tribute.,"Our first ever trip to New York, a five day visit.We both agreed we somehow felt duty-bound to make the 9/11 museum our first place to visit.It’s hard to describe how stunning this museum is - in design, content, sensitivity and atmosphere. The collection of exhibits, displays, photographs and audio/video playbacks makes for an almost overwhelming visitor experience. A beautiful balance of commemoration of the victims and tribute to all those who played a part in responding to the attacks. If you’re ever in New York and have time to visit only one place, please visit this museum. And if you haven’t got the time to spend a couple of hours in the museum, then try at least to visit the plaza outside the museum, where there are two pools and waterfalls sited at the bases of what were the North and South towers, surrounded by walls on which are inscribed the names of all those who lost their lives in the 9/11 outrage.A few hours after our visit, in midtown Manhattan, we got into brief conversation with a FDNY firefighter who was holding pedestrians back while an engine was reversing into his station. He told us that of the 443 firefighters who lost their lives on 9/11, 15 were based at his station. I reached out to pat him on the shoulder and tried to say, ‘Good job’ but just choked up. So he patted me on my shoulder!Whether you believe in religion or not, the WTC 9/11 site is a sacred place and we felt sad and honoured to have walked there."
World trade Center memorial,"What an awesome place to visit, I love the graffiti on the actual site and the new standing site, beautiful!!! A must see place, you can't help but to wonder to that date😔"
Humbling,"A worthwhile experience all be it very humbling a very reflective day . , I didn’t quite understand the the part in relation to bin laden , I understand mentioning it but not what basically will be his shrine to his atrocities"
Must see,Visiting the 9 / 11 museum/ memorial was highly emotional. The exhibits expose you to the horrific event and the heroics of so many people. You will truly never forget your visit.
The SEPT 11 IN 180 GREENWICH ST of the World Trade Center,"The Sept 11 space in 180 GREENWICH ST of the World Trade Center is a like to have a connection with a special situation...Something horrible happened and the AMERICAN PEOPLE could do it, again! fight with beauty over the madness of the past...You must to visit this Special Place!!!"
Overwhelming beautiful exhibit of a horrible event in our history,"The moment I walked up to the North building memorial the emotion was overwhelming. All I could do was cry. I felt it was important to walk around and look at every name at both the North and South building water memorial.. In the museum the stories of the people and timeline was beautiful. It's important to learn about waht happened, how it happened, how we came together to help each other. If you are visiting NYC, this is the place you need to go."
"Somber, but necessary. ","This is an incredibly moving place to visit. It isn’t easy, but it’s something that is necessary to know and understand the impact of what happened that day. We booked in advance, but when we arrived it appeared that there wasn’t a need for this. However, at other times it could be busier."
Awe inspiring.,I do not know at what age it would be appropriate to introduce children to the events of 9/11. It is important that they learn it sometime.
Very moving ,"A very moving & heart Braking too see & walk around, the silence is eerie & the experience overwhelming. One minute your in the busy city streets then around the corner is 9/11. The north & south pool's with everyone's name, too walk around then there's the museum. Use the official cloakroom too store your hats & coats taking time too walk around & take everything in & remember, never forget 9/11"
A must see,"This is a must see in my opinion , there’s so much to take in and you don’t realise the scale of the tragedy till you do this , it’s so very poignant and quite a somber mood in here it’s so quiet . There’s a part where you can’t take photos which is the more personal part of the museum where you can hear phone calls to loved ones from people in the towers or calls from the cabin crew to ground control and personal items from those that sadly died . It brought me to tears a few times. Such a sad tragedy but a beautiful memorial to remember those that were killed that day."
Must See,This is a must see for everyone.  It is worth a trip to NYC just to go to this museum.  Allow at least 4 hours to see everything.
Understanding the Event,"I knew it would be heart wrenching. I knew it would have dramatic photos and interactive visits. I thought I was mentally prepared. however, you cannot arrive ""prepared"" and still not be overwhelmed by the experience. Thousands of people killed. Tens of thousands immediately affected by the loss in their business or their family or their leadership.  For instance, the firetruck that is twisted damaged (?engine #5), that had finished an overnight work shift and was off for an hour when the chief saw the fire. He called everyone and everyone loaded up and went to the fire. the engine company had been around for nearly 100years. Numerous generations of firefighters had served on the same engine company. Everyone on that truck died that day. It was, literally, end of the line.  I was moved by the stories, by the photos, by how BIG it was. I experienced every emotion I have: joy for those who were saved, courage for those who countered the terrorists and crashed their plane into a field (losing themselves, but saving so man others), anger against the terrorists, sorrow for those who perished, and wonder of the beauty of the artwork that shows we will continue on."
"Amazing Museum, Extremely Important to Visit","Each of us should take the time to visit this site...we will be reminded of what people really encountered that day who worked, lived in the area or came to help.  The impact on each of us is presented, and the changes that powerfully changed our history as a nation and the world.  It takes time to go through it, and much of it is startling.  Shows a tragic day and how it would affect all the days following."
Tour,This was something I have wanted to do for years. This year for my birthday we were able to go. It was definitely worth every second I've waited. It brought tears and made you remember why your a proud american! Seeing the remains and memorial was surreal. I recommend seeing it both day and evening.
Memorial,This place was beyond words.  Its a must see experience.  The fine detail of everything! I am thankful that i  got to see this display - the architectural work was just amazing!
Very somber experience ,Anyone who can remember where they were on 9/11 should visit. The museum is a great memorial to those who lost their lives. We didn’t have to wait in line on a Monday afternoon and went thru it in 3 hours
Shocking,Place where you have to go to relive the catastrofe of 11/09. On Tuesday afternoons admission is free (4.00pm). the memorial is beautiful and silence
So moving,So very moving . After watching those terrible events unfold thousands of miles away it was touching to be able to pay my respects.  So personal and moving
Emotional,Try to visit this memorial without getting emotional.  A beautiful tribute to an incredibly horrific event
A must see,This memorial and museum is a must see for anyone visiting the city. Anyone that was alive during 9/11 will never forget it but we learned so many things that we never knew. We also heard stories from people in the city on that day and stories of the brave men and women of this city who perished on that very day. This feeling comes over you as soon as you get close...and it doesn't leave you for hours after leaving. I would visit again.
Amazing and sad.,A definitely do not miss. Brings back some not good memories - brought me to tears more than once. My sons (who do not remember the day) 'enjoyed' it also.
Hard to believe how long ago it was.,"Although it is now 18 years since 9/11, the images and feelings are as vivid as the day the attack happened.  The museum does a great job of honouring those who died and those heroes of the day.  It is worth the guided tour (free) over the self-guided earphones.  Our guide provided interesting info we would have been sorry to miss.Worthwhile.  We also enjoyed the dramatic fountain outside.  Very moving."
Captures the 9/11 Moment and the Aftermath,"Relying heavily on on-the-scene reporting and recollection, this is an essential encapsulation of what transpired that tragic day, and its aftermath."
In Remembrance,"Seeing the memorial brings back memories and explanations to my sin, who was a baby at the time of the attacks. Am glad for us to have gone, painful as it was."
An emotional journey,"This is a museum I believe every person should visit. It is an experience that is hard to explain, but you encounter heartbreak for the victims and their families. I got a much better understanding of the scope of the event and its global impact, and I have a greater admiration for the brave individuals who responded to an unimaginable event."
Very emotional,"...but, definitely worth making time for. Very tasteful, but tragic. It starts simply enough with some artifacts, then, eventually includes video and audio."
"Interesting, thought-provoking memorial","The memorial pools, with their sheets of water cascading down the walls to collect in large basins and then running down further deep wells into which we cannot see, are surprising for their quiet, thought-provoking drama.  Such an interesting concept.  Names are etched all around both pools, reminding us of the dead, while just steps away is the survivor pear tree, reminding us of life. Well worth seeing!"
Sobering ,"Such an emotive experience. I’m humbled at the things I read, and saw.  Thank you for the reminder, of the attack but also the fortitude and resilience from New Yorkers."
Bin Laden exhibit,"Third time we have been to the Memorial, this time specifically to see the new  exhibit about the hunt and eventual end of Bin Laden. Well worth the admission even if  you have been to the Museum before. Doing the ""skip the line"" ticket is the easiest way and there are discounts for Military, Vets and Seniors."
Emotional,"Wow – very emotional to see the pools and the names surrounding them. Roses are placed in the names on their birthday. So impactful. We didn’t go into museum, just walked the grounds. They have great rules for no music, skateboards, pets etc….it is almost like an outdoor church. Highly recommend!"
very moving,"A brilliant memorial to everyone that lost their lives,It truely is worthwhile to visit and experienceI was in tears"
Powerful!,Thank-you for this emotional remembrance of sadness and for helping us to never forget!  Everyone needs to go here.  God Bless the United States of America’s!
memorable,"You will need at least 3/4 hours to go around the museum to hear,see & listen to everything, It's very moving, especially the photos of people jumping. Take your time & give it the respect it deserves."
We did not do the museum,Thought the memorial was so beautiful and very sad too.   It had been very discreetly done and they were just finishing another area to remember those who had died since9/11 in the aftermath of dust inhalation or other injuries sustained.  They are making it looks very pleasant place to visit.
my,i went there and the place is absolutly amazing. very emotional and lots of interesting facts. lines went fast. brings back a lot of memories
Afternoon visit ,"Spent an afternoon here with the family. Very sad to see all the remains of the twin towers and people’s belongings. You hear tapes of the last phone calls and see posters of the missing people. Lots to see, would recommend."
Very good museum,"Very good museum, all underground, it’s got an unusual feel to especially when your underneath the tower footprints."
Leave enough time! ,"This was an emotional one. We opted for a guided tour which I can’t recommend enough - our guide was Nanty who was fantastic. We were a small group but she allowed up to move through at your own time, explaining each exhibit as we went. It really was one of the most moving things I’ve ever done, 99% of the people were respectful and there was a eerie silence falling over much of the space. The lay out and construction of the museum has been done with thought and consideration, all culminating into an immersive experience. There are two extra exhibits but due to our poor timing we didn’t get a chance to visit. Please plan for at least 3/4 hours if you choose the guided tour which I would highly encourage you to do. You learn about personal stories, both those of survivors and those whom lives were taken. I couldn’t recommend this highly enough, it’s emotive yet respectful. A beautiful tribute."
Going back to Ground Zero for the first time,Everybody knows where they were on 9/11... and were witness to the worst terrorist attack on US soil. I remember as a kid riding the subway into New York and getting off at the World Trade Center. The 9/11 Memorial is a wonderful place. I didn’t know a lot of the stories about a lot of the people who died that day. This place really tells the stories. The pools where the towers once stood are beautiful. This is a part of history that is a must see.
Very informative and accurate museum,"There are lots of pictures, videos and other things that help you understand the dimension of what happened on that sad day.It really makes you connect with the people who witnessed, who were part of it and their families."
Heartbreaking,"What an emotionally charged place this is. Outside the museum are the memorial fountains to honour those people who passed that tragic day, this had my wife in tears and me with ""something in my eye"".The museum itself is a fantastic tribute to the events of 9/11. It's is as you can imagine an emotional environment. There is the memorial hall with a photo of those people who deserve to be remembered with an additional area where the families have recorded messages about their loved ones. I am not going to spoil the museum for those who want to visit but please take plenty of tissues and be prepared to get a lump in your throat and that ""something in your eye"".Oh you can also download the 9/11 museum audio guide to your smartphone but have it turned really low or use earphones as I was asked to turn mine down by an abrupt individual member of staff.Anyway go and visit the museum."
Great Museum - Give yourself Enough time,Last time we were in NYC the national 9/11 museum was not open yet. We bought tickets at the machine outside and were able to go straight in early afternoon mid week.From the outside the footprint is not large but the building  has multiple levels down to the foundations of the WTC 1 & 2. We were tired and need more time to full  appreciate all the displays. The best part was the volunteers or staff telling there personal stories and describing some of the displays.Great displays handling traumatic subject matter with minimal flag waving.
Very Moving,"I like many, remember exactly where I was when hearing about 911. This museum is a very moving experience. It has been done with the upmost respect for the victims and families and gives a great insight into the events of that day"
Not to be missed.,As a firefighter for 45 years this was an emotional experience. I experienced everything from tears to anger and frustration. This is a very well done memorial that should be a permanent part of our history. Never Forget!!
A must see,"Amazing. The quiet of the visitors there said it all. A fitting tribute to a truly terrible event, and a sobering experience."
Emotional ,"We all know where we were and what we were doing on the day this tragedy happened, i was last here 25 years ago when the skyline was extremely different. I found the memorial and museum to be a suitable and fitting remembrance of this tragedy that affected so many people from all over the world. I shed some tears it has to be said. But so glad i visited."
Sensitively done ,I had visited the site of 9/11 on a previous visit before the museum had opened. I was a bit apprehensive about going as wasn’t sure how they could have presented a museum in a sensitive way. It was really worth going and we were there a long time. It’s quiet and respectful but very informative. Also the way it is set out you don’t have to see or listen to things you don’t want too. I think they have done a good job and I think this museum will be very important to ensure that generations in the future remember the significance of that day to all of us.
Thought provoking,"Yes, it’s wonderful (sorry for the two stars) but I found it really upsetting. And I consider myself a tough cookie."
Very Impressive & Moving,What an incredible memorial!  I highly recommend visiting it if you're ever in NYC; it's a must see.  I recommend booking your tickets on-line but you can also buy at the kiosks or window.  One can spend easily 3 to 4 hours going through the memorial museum.  I was very moved.
Vacation,This whole place including the memorial and the museum were very impressive and emotionally charged I guess to anyone who visits. Still I felt at peace there with the rest of the visitors. Museum cost $28 but believe me is worth it.
aww inspiring,this memorial was the highlight of our NY trip. Sobering and inspiring at the same time. Blessings to all the  first responders.
History,What a great memorial for the tragedy this country endured. It is a must to see in NYC but make sure you keep enough time to take it all in and not rush.
Very emotional,"The museum is very emotional remembering what happened, seeing all the photos and belongings of the people that died, really worth a visit"
Very good tour,"I visited in February 2020 with my 12 year old son.  We pre-booked a guided tour starting at 9.30am.  Access was easy - no queue.  The tour was led by a really informative young guide who was terrific.  We all had headsets so she didn't have to shout and we could hear her even if we wondered a few yards away.  It took an hour and then we spent about another hour there on our own.  The whole museum and the tour is really well done - respectful and informative. I was so impressed.  When we got back to the UK, my son was telling people that it was his favourite part of the trip."
Nice addon to the museum,Used the free audio guide tour. The museum is quite good and great for following up with all the 9/11 information most of the people got from the media around the world.The tour is really useful and practical to guide you along the way.
A sad part of our history.,"The museum does an excellent job of re-telling the horrible events of 911, but it also shows the heroism, bravery, and care of those who helped their fellow man."
An amazing Memorial,It was an incredible experience to see what went on that day and to see the detail of the flights and the all people who were affected. Very family place and just amazing to see what was left and the damage it caused. One of the best museums and a place to remember.
Must see,If this is your first time in NY this is a must see. Even if you jave watched documentaries etc. On 911 you will still learn something new. Its weird how you are in the city yet being in the memorial it is so quite and sombre. Inside of the museum you will see parts of the building and fire trucks that were damaged. Its so sad to read as you go through but a must so you can learn more and to stop this tragedy happen again.
Good place to visit for the documentation and heartfelt exhibition of that life changing event!,"Interesting museum which documents that horrible experience. I liked the expansive exhibition at the beginning of the museum; however, I felt constricted and not enough space when seeing the enclosed gallery where the personal effects and videos were shown. There was so much to see and I may have to go back again since I felt overwhelmed visually and emotionally."
9/11 A Memorialized Day in History,"I observed, I read, I listened, I communitated with others.  I cried.  This is an extreme emotional journey to that fatefull day in 2001 when the world stood still.  Those moments etched in our minds forever."
Shocking,"It was an incredible experience, it takes you to that day.The recorded messages, the stairs, the video.. it’s amazing."
