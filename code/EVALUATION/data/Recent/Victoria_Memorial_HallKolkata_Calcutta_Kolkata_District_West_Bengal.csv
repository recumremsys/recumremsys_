Very nice,It's a wonderful beautiful building.I would suggest everyone visiting kolkata to visit this place..
Visit to Victoria Memorial,Excellent place to visit. Historical as well as majestic. A memory which you will cherish for a lifetime. Visit was made more memorable by Calcutta Walks and their guide Ritwick Ghosh.
Superb collection!,"Truly an amazing collection of India‚Äôs glorious past. Loved the free guided tour , the tour guide Mr. Raghu Nandan Biswas gave a great overview  on the artefacts and the historic details . If you are visiting Kolkata anytime and are interested in knowing about our glorious colonial and medieval era history , this is the place to be ."
A beautiful piece of architecture,"This wasn't in my list and I had to visit this place because of a cab driver. I didn't regret it though They have a entry fee of around 25 INR ( not sure though ) and your baggage will be checked by para military before entering The lush green gardens and the tall building will make you fall in love with it. The old rifles,monuments, statues and other artefacts will definitely make you travel back in time. This is a must see place in India if you are a lover of history and architecture"
Awesome,"think about very nice world no-1 place beautiful moments my life thanks, travels Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport Kolkata nearby."
Most Evident Remnants of The Colonial Past,"Built in early nineteenth century in memory of Queen Victoria after her death is perhaps the most popular structure in Kolkata. The marble structure combines variety of architecture styles like Indian & British along with touch of Egyptian, Venetian & Mughal.  A tour of building is very educative as you get glimpses of British colonial ruled period.The white marble structure reflects city‚Äôs colonial past."
Beautiful Structure worth Visiting,"If you are near the area, definitely try to make time for visiting this place. Best to visit before evening. Also when going, ask for the entrance area, as there is entry allowed from only certain points."
Victoria Memorial Hall,The Victoria Memorial hall in Kolkata is perhaps the grandest sign of the British Raj. The building itself is imposing and majestic in well laid out spacious grounds. The many interesting displays and galleries in the building are also a well maintained and interesting.
amazing plsce,"i had heard a lot about this place so it was  a must go place in the list i loved the well maintained garden hall architecture and surrounding around this place you can spend couple of hours there , evening is best time to visit"
"Make sure you  have time, if you are really interested in History.","There is so much to see and absorb if you are really interested in Indian History and the Raj, so do ensure you have the time to see and browse. If you do not enjoy history then do not bother to visit, let those that do have more room."
Very nice gardens,"We went there on Republic Day, 26th January when it was very crowded and the locals were enjoying relaxing in the sun with their children running around joyessly and sharing picnics - made my mouth water at some of the foods they were having.I was approached several times to have my picture taken and was very happy to do so. Very friendly and happy people !!  0:)"
Incredible,"Amazing place....Loved it, iconic, best tourist place to visit in Kolkata.Good to visit with families and friends."
Love this building,I have visited here before a couple of times actually. This time was a night visit if you go before 10pm it is lit up with different hues of colour. Worth seeing and good for photos.
Very good place to visit in winter.,One of the best places with combinations of historical place as well as nature like pond and trees. Clean and sober.
It was a nice walk with some amazing historical reading.,"Had a splendid experience walking around the monument and learning about it's construction, the British era and the history of India between 1700s and 1950. The monument is grand and surrounded by beautiful lakes with some amazing Flora and Fauna. We also spent some time through‚Ä¶"
Day Tour,Very interesting sight to visit with lots of galleries. Beautiful gardens as well. A memorial built for Queen Victoria 
Historic,One of the must see places. Built during British regime. Historic monument. Lots of things to see inside the museum. Also surrounded by a very good park.
Must visit ,"The most iconic monument of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial is known for its immaculately maintained lawns and gardens which attract locals and tourists alike. Check out the rotating fairy on top of the dome."
Awesome staff,"We had a charity ball at the hall, the staff were amazing especially Laura and Danielle they catered for our every need and it felt like a very safe happy environment 10/10"
Place wort to visit,Place worth to visit. Monument of Self-importance and Loyalty to the Queen. Build by Indian for British.  Worth to stay couple of hours with a good camera. Tickets for foreigners are much much more than RS 20-30.
good place for morning and evening walk.,this is a good place for morning walk and making friends from all over Kolkata.This also have number of visitors from all over the county to see the monument andit is a nice place to visit for first time visitor.

Magnificent. Majestic. ,Simply majestic and magnificent. We went during the day as well as night. A huge property with a well kept park. Any ardent Instagrammer will find this place awesome. A must visit while in Kolkata.
A must visit in Kolkata,"One of the best places to visit in Kolkata. The place is beautifully kept , great architecture. There is huge statue of queen Victoria in the entrance.The exhibits tells you a great story about Kolkata and the British role there.Definitely recommend"
Fabulous building at great at night. ,Well worth walking around if you are nearby. Looks great illuminated at night. Lots of market stalls selling food nearby.
Superb place for adults as well as children,A beautiful building built in the British era surrounded by endless green well maintained gardens interspersed with small water bodies will lift the hearts of everyone. The children can enjoy the endless gardens  while the grown ups can add to the experience by visiting the museum. If u are visiting from another city make sure to keep a full day aside for a complete experience.
Great place ,"This place is a tourist place. It has a wonderful white structured building with a beautiful statue of queen Victoria in front , surrounded by huge well manicured gardens, lawns. Inside the building is a small museum having artifacts, weapons of olden times. Overall a great place to visit!!"
"Not just another museum, a masterpiece of history!","It seems like no trip to Calcutta is complete without a visit to the Victoria Memorial. I was blown away by the experience there, actually, not merely because of the building itself, but what's inside it. The exhibits there tell a fascinating story about Calcutta herself and the role of the British when they arrived."
VICTORIA MEMORIAL,Good place to visit and you feel the history today.  A great structure and excellent engineering of past. It shows the advancement of engineering on that time.
Victorian Charm,A must visit for any Traveller to Kolkata. It has treasures from the British Raj which cannot be seen elsewhere. The place is well maintained and under surveillance. The art collection was amazing and the statues of Queen Victoria and other British Viceroy's of India were grand.There is a buggy( horse carriage) ride available outside the place...it's not too expensive and was fun to do.
European Architecture in Kolkata,"We arrived at the Victoria Memorial Hall during a local holiday day. The line fo tickets was huge. We decided to visit the gardens only. Couples and families wandering along the wide grass areas, taking selfies and sometimes want to take a selfie with you. The park is large and well kept, but relatively to European sites, it is nothing to tell home about."
A wonderful monument of British India.,"A wonderful monument of British India. The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Kolkata, which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819‚Äì1901) and is now a museum. In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria, The 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston (later created The 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston), the then Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens. The Prince of Wales, later King George V, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.      It is currently a grand museum. From perfectly preserved and maintained in excellent condition"
History,Great collection of historical importance. Must see place if visiting Kolkata. Grand place. The museum has been methodically planned and well maintained. Must visit
A marvellous monument to British imperialism,"This is something else again. A time machine that takes one back to the years before the First World War although only built in 1921. It is a tribute to its eponymous dedicatee. Extracted nay blackmailed into contributing, India was generous in its tribute to her. The building is instartlingly white Indian marble. Ornate and rather elegant. Once past the bronze of Victoria Emperatrix , one steps into a vast echoing hall surmounted by a galleried cupola. The first sight is a beautiful statue of the young queen. The ground floor is full of loot, portraits of the dignitaries of Victoria‚Äôs India, watercolours by her sailors, cannon, a wonderful black marble table mounted on four bronze howitzers, weapons of the period of British rule.Upstairs I found an exquisite exhibition of Indian miniatures that took me a full hour to see properly."
Marble Building,This is a large marble building dedicated to queen victoria. It is a kind of museum and best tourist place
Stunning building,"Despite the statue of that pompous git Curzon at the front, this is one of the great buildings of India particularly viewed from an angle at twilight. Beautifully executed, beautifully maintained"
Nice place for Visit,It's a great place to see... Very beautiful building and peaceful place has a very large open area.... We can sit.... Play... Relax. There. Great place for time pass and a good way to get relaxation from city crowd
Not much things to see,"Kolkata seems has not many attractions, and Victoria Memorial has not much things to see. Visitors also have to join a long queue in front of the ticket counter, and 2 entrance gates. Total wasted time is 1 hour while the visit is not more than 1 hour. If you're not a fan of architecture and British Royal families, you can skip this attraction"
Heart of Kolkata,"This major historical site in Kolkata is really worth visiting for its historical value and lovely gardens. There are night tours available too where you can see the monument lit in dark night. But I only could see it from outside.Inside is a good museum where we get to see some good paintings giving us a glimpse of yesteryear times. In the 1st floor, there are few shows arranged. When I visited it was a painting exhibition from an art gallery that was being exhibited."
beautiful architecture and colonial style ,"A beautiful building and gardens in the middle of a crazy busy city.  Make the effort to visit, it is worth it."
Must visit monument,"Victoria memorial is a widespread estate with a musuem surrounded by a huge beautiful garden. There are ponds, green lawns, trees all over. The museum has life size stautes carved in marble if most if the British viceroriys and governors. The biggest attraction is the worlds largest painting of oil on one piece canvas size @ 7meters x 7 meters. Its a treat to watch. Its a must visit on your list. Enjoy the tour. It takes twi hours for the museum tour so go with amoke time on hand. Enjoy!!"
Victoria Memorial,The Victoria Memorial is a large beautiful marble building built between 1906 and 1921 during the British era. Has lustrous green garden around the building and a small part of the building has been opened up as a museum. Nice place for a picnic / family outing.
A sight that has to be seen.,"Dramatic empire style/Edwardian architecture that still looks brilliant despite losing some gloss when cleaned of the black paint job that was done in World War II. Really interesting collection of sculpture, paintings, documents and some memorabilia inside. All surrounded by beautifully kept gardens."
Can be better maintained,"It's an iconic building not only of Kolkata, but the whole of India. Sadly, the gardens and the ponds are not maintained as the status. I wish Indians took more pride in their heritage."
Worth a second visit,"Extraordinary building, interesting paintings, pleasant grounds, and eye-catching fellow visitors. I went twice"
Historic visit,Revisiting this place brought back memories from my childhood when during Christmas holidays we would visit Kolkata n this place. Has a lovely garden . Beautifully done up decor. Although very crowded....but every tourist place is so. Favorite family outing during winters. Great for picnics
Beautiful Building with Interesting exhibits.,If there is one thing to see in Kolkata it is this building.  It is in a lovely park and a wonderful place to spend some time.  Some of the exhibits could use some TLC.  It is unfortunate that there is not more attention paid to the exhibits.
Excellent piece of Art,"A British era monument beautifully sculpted. One of the icons of Kolkata, must see place of this city. Best time to visit is in the morning to avoid hot sun. Gardens are beautifully done too. One can spend 1.5 to 2 hours here if interested in history."
Old Charm,Victoria Memorial hall is an old charm. Their gardens are well maintained. I do not feel Grandeur while visiting inside Main hall. Public management process is not too efficient. Items on display are not properly maintained. I am not very much satisfied with its up keep.
A bigger scale than I expected,"Expect to spend 90 minutes to two hours here.  It will be time well spent.  There is a mixture of exhibits.  Some grand paintings and sculptures, surely.  But the obsessively detailed quarter on the history of Kolkata is fascinating, but also tiring.  It's more than you can absorb completely.  But you can choose where to dip in deeply and where to skim the service.  A fun and informative visit."
Beautiful place,This one is a masterpiece. Just see what the Britishers have left for us. Beautiful.. my family likes it very much
Wonderful place,Wondeful place to hang out. I visited this place almost 10 times. Its the best place in kolkata to spent some time with ur loved one.
Never disappoints ,"Well maintained historical structure which is essential attendance for all new and repeat visitors coming to Kolkata, to infirm and remind how central this city was to Indian and British trades and cultures since the late seventeenth century. Beautiful grounds outside, beautiful galleries and exhibits and ceilings inside."
Beautiful building and parks,"Lovely park and lake for a stroll around, very well kept and worth a few photos.  Not sure its worth 1000 rupees for 2, for a walk, when there are other nice parks around with free entrance, but there is a museum of sorts."
Impressive and relaxing visit,"Go early to beat the crowds - we were let inside the park before ten, so were some of the first visitors inside and could appreciate the beautiful building itself and also the painting gallery and interesting exhibition of the history of Kolkata. Highly recommend this place. Walk in the park was also very relaxing, it is an oasis within the chaos and noise of the city."
Journey into india's colonial past,The garden is beautiful and well maintained. The lakes and waterbodies are pleasing to the eye. The memorial is a huge imposing structure.
Beautiful place for spend quality time,One of the most visited places in Kolkata. Weekend and afternoon is bit crowded but it‚Äôs a very beautiful Victorian style building surrounded by large beautiful gardens and fountains
Memorable place,Very gud and ancient monument to visit. Had a great story of the place and property also maintained very well by government.
Really beautiful building and interesting,"We spent a couple of hours here along with hundreds of other visitors, avoid the weekend if you can and be prepared to be asked to be in a photo if you are a foreigner. For some reason the locals like to have a photo with you, which we found a bit weird at first but wee fine about. the locals are really very friendly.The building is very beautiful and has an excellent history museum inside, so expect to spend a good couple of hours here."
Fabulous architecture,What a marvellous building to commemorate Queen Victoria.  Built between 1916 to 1920 it is a tribute to British design and architecture. A must place to visit although the entry fee is 30rupees for Indians but 500rupees for us foreigners. Racial discrimination that would not be tolerated in UK. Did not detract from my enjoyment at being there.
MUST VISIT,This is the highlight of Kolkata. Interesting museum with amazing architecture. Reminds one of the Taj Mahal. Beautiful gardens. Need at least half a day to a day to visit and take it all in. Situated in a lovely green area of Kolkata too.
Impressive memorial of British occupation ,"Invading a country, make its people work for a small country on the other side of the world and then have them pay for a preposterous building say all about colonialism. The building itself is impressive though, but it‚Äôs INR500 for foreigners to go in and look at old guns and paintings."
Grand building,"A great building builit by Britisher and is iconic symbol of Kolkata today. A great place to walk around. Nice sculpture, beautiful garden and wonderful landscaping with very nice architecture"
Stunning building ,This grand monument to Queen Victoria is a beautiful building in Kolkata. The gardens surrounding the building are also lovely. Inside is a mish mash of museum type displays and artwork.  The artwork is not my style but locals were snapping photos all round.  The building is huge and really lovely~ a white beacon amidst the chaos outside.Entry cost 500 rupees.
Gem of Kolkata,"Victoria Memorial has always been one of the favourite places to hangout for couples to spend some quality time with you Special one's.But nowadays they are not allowing to sit in the garden.Moreover this has always been one of the attraction of Kolkata, you should definitely visit this place once in your lifetime."
Great heritage,"Excellent museum with a lot of historical information, paintings and a few artefacts. Must visit place for a history lover."
Access for the Disabled,It was very difficult to access the entrance to the Victoria Memorial with a child in a wheelchair. The cemented path is only partially completed with pebbles and stones as filling seperating the concreted strip so we had to carry our child and wheelchair to cross the pebbles to prevent the stones getting locked in the wheels.ln addition there are no ramps at the entrance and you have to carry your child accross the steps. No facilities for wheelchair tourists
A gem for all,This major historical site in Kolkata is really worth visiting for its historical value and lovely gardens. Sunset is a great time to go to get great photos
Major attraction in Kolkata - Take the tour,"This is a major historical site in Kolkata.  It is not worth more than an hour.  There is a free guided in the Memorial Hall that is worth the time.  Check out the paintings.  There are a few hidden gems in there.  Do not miss ""Bharat Mata"" by Abanindranath Tagore."
Crowded,"This is a popular tourist destination and there is a lot of history here, but it is incredibly crowded. There is very little breathing room, making it hard to see some artifacts. If you are visiting as a foreigner, I recommend getting a guide to help shortcut the long lines and to highlight the important artifacts."
Worth a visit,Lovely gardens and interesting displays inside.  Interesting and even-handed history of Calcutta/Kolkata. Make sure you go up and circle the dome looking down on the statue of Queen Victoria.
Beautiful building and architecture,Its symbolic to Kolkata and is right in heart of the city. In season during morning hours the que for ticket is long. It's moves fast but you can avoid by checking online also. It's a great place for morning walk as well.
Magnificent monument ,Its centrally located near other Kolkata attractions... amazing monuments a piece of art ... good sight seeing visit
Overrated ,It is one of the most overrated places in Kolkata. Park is decent sized but during the evenings it is crowded with low standard people who are only there to create nuisance. Majorly couples who have got no sense of public decency. Museum is opened till early evening but is nothing much to write about. Overall something I would suggest to skip but very few would skip as it comes first in any itinerary for Kolkata
majestic Monument and Gallery,"A must visit place at Kolkata, massive structure with rare collection of ancient items and historical important items, normally not much rush but lighted up and packed during special occasions. You must have atleast 3-4 hours to spend there"
Historical Monument,"Visit this place, if you love visiting and watching historical place. Its a beautiful huge building. Inside this is the museum having belongings and photographs of the queen Victoria. Outside is the garden, where you can spend quality time. Spare 1-2 hour to visit this place. Personally i rate this place as routine, average place, NOT MUST Visit place. We visited only for sake of visit as we were first time at kolkata with family. Nearby is the Birla planetaurium, 5-10 minute walking distance, loved by kids."
Good place ,Thank You can plan your family on winter season & also you can enjoy the ganga river side fjkggbm hjknffj hkkvfhj
Victoria,Very beautiful place to visit.the garder is very decorated. Love the place very much.have a try you will love
Memorable trip,The pride of Kolkata is Victoria Memorial Hall.The atmosphere inside is like a touch of the mind.This Victoria Memorial Hall is within a few hundred bighas of land.Here you will see all the historical things.By looking at them you can find out a lot of history.
Sunday,"Beautiful building, but some rooms were closed. Nice visit for a Sunday morning, also good to walk around in the garden."
Beautiful,"This was exceptionally beautiful...the building is lovely and the gardens are even better.green clean and well kept..must go..first public place in india I have seen that has such well kept gardens.. no litter,no spit, no screaming...and great history..."
Historical place,It's a good example of architecture white building with history of indian freedom movement every one who visit kolkata should visit this place just to know our history
Enjoyable place to walk around for 20 RS,Opted to avoid the museum as it was 500 per foreigner. Instead took the 20 ticket which allows you to walk around the gardens which were very well kept.
Visited after a long time,"Good place to visit and see different types of historical weapons, museum and queen victoria & the inside view of the palace is unique u have ever seen. People come here from different places to visit and experience it."
The best monument to worth of visit,"The best monument to worth of visit in Kolkata and also the most significat, if you are not Hindu. I enjoyed also walk in a park all around."
Powerplay by the British occupiers to suppress or impress the locals.,"More than 100 years old, huge building to honor  queen Victoria. Even London doesn‚Äôt have done this. The Indian blue collars made it , but only statues of white British occupiers in and around the beautiful building, a must do when you are here, locals 30 rupees and old colonials like me 500....!The exhibition about the history is full of neglected paintings etc. They have to take more care about that. Otherwise this heritage will disappear slowly. The garden around it is nice and all mainly indian visitors enjoyed and made selfie after selfie.The main question which British intellectual decided to build this , because of Victoria in Kolkata to impress or / and insult the locals.Who paid for this ?"
Must visit,Informative but crowded.Unable to read as people were pushing.Lovely architecture and a must visit place.
Kalkuta ,Great place to visit while in Kalkuta . The quality of air it‚Äôs not the best so make sure you have a breathing mask
For One Night Only,"This magnificent piece of architecture was built for Queen Victoria's visit to Calcutta, whist it was the Capital of British India. She stayed in it for one night only.No matter what your view on colonialism are (mine are definitely not in favour of!) a visit to this magnificent monument that is now a museum's a must. Its very much an active place - people use the gardens for morning runs and yoga and walks- and as such is just a tad grimy. Visit it anyway. You won't be disappointed."
Beautiful and peaceful ,"It is beautiful, well maintained, relaxing place. The day I went there is not crowded, weather was fine.Museum is not big, but have some good paintings to see.I like the architecture and garden.Foreigner's ticket price is higer, for me is acceptable though.ÊòØÂÄãÁæéÈ∫óËÄåÊÑúÊÑèÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÔºåÁ∂≠Ë≠∑Âæó‰∏çÈåØÔºåÂª∫ÁØâÁâ©Êú¨È´îË∑üËä±ÂúíÈÉΩÂæàÊºÇ‰∫Æ„ÄÇÊàëÂéªÁöÑÈÇ£‰∏ÄÂ§©‰∏çÊìÅÊì†ÔºåËÄå‰∏îÂ§©Ê∞£ÂæàÂ•Ω„ÄÇË£°Èù¢ÁöÑÂçöÁâ©È§®‰∏çÂ§ßÔºåÈÇÑÊòØÊúâ‰∫õ‰ΩúÂìÅÂèØ‰ª•ÁúãÁúã„ÄÇÂ§ñÂúã‰∫∫ÁöÑÁ•®ÂÉπÊØîËºÉÈ´òÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÊàëÈÇÑÊòØÂèØ‰ª•Êé•ÂèóÁöÑ„ÄÇ"
"When in Kolkata, A Must Visit Place!",One of the things that I admire about this place is the lush green lawns with colourful flowers blooming. It has been well maintained. The gardens provide a very relaxing place for those who visit here. This place looks so beautiful at night and is pleasing to the eyes.The place is open for the public for all days of the week except Monday and entry fee is very minimal. A special light and sound show is held as well. Photography inside the structure is strictly prohibited and one can only take snaps from outside.
It explains the history of Kolkata.,"As a history lover, this is where you find it in Kolkata, pre-during and after the British. A bit dusty, but the story is worth it."
A Must see Attraction,"If you visit Kolkata and not visit this place, you would be missing an absolute gem. The building is beautiful from inside and outside. If you are interested a little bit into Architecture, history then you will love it. The inside of the dome is just great."
Colonial Architecture,"A trip to this monument will takes us back into  the History of the pre British era. The building is majestically designed in symmetrical fashion and looks beautiful. The sprawling lawns are an added delight. Illumination of the building added variety to my visit.  To my disappointment (in Dec 2019), the Queens Hall was closed for renovations, & thus to that extent I wasn't to delighted. The Kolkata Police band was a pleasant surprise ( which we are informed play out on Sundays ).I could have rated the experience very good but  for the fact I couldn't go to the museum."
Feel of European Style Structure,This is one of the must visit places if you are in Kolkatta for the first time.The structure is currently going repairs on western side. Good lawns all around with water bodies. Museum offers good insight of pre 1900 events.
Dirty,The onlyt thing is having photo in the garden. There is no any interesting thing inside and it is very dirty!
The city Icon of Kolkata,To identify city of Joy Kolkata this unique memorial is the symbol of this city.An open space for the visitors to enjoy the winter during sun light.
Colonial style edifice,Lovely building housing dull unrestored paintings and unremarkable artefacts.More effort could be put into making these displays more appealing
Big white Memorial ,Victoria  Memorial is a famous memorial of Kolkata. Huge area and well maintained. Entrance fee is not costly and separate ticket to enter Memorial hall.
Beautiful ,The building us beautiful and looks gorgeous. Though I thought could have been maintained better. The location  is just breathtaking.
Very nice place,"This place has a great mixture of both natural beauty and Historical beauty as well, preferable place for couples, family get together also a must visit for photography enthusiasts."
Beautiful structure having a decent museum ,"The structure is magnificent and very beautiful and surrounded by sprawling lawns. It is one of the beautiful structures that the Brits built in India. When in Kolkata, it‚Äôs a recommended place to visit. The museum is small but decent and it aptly chronicles the history of Kolkata (since advent of the Brits)."
Entry fee,I was in durga puja holiday.For ticket line is too long for 1 he's.I booked online and its too costly .Front side had work so it closed . enter with back side and its interested.its memorable place
Interesting and informative ,"In our five day stay in Kolkata we came here three times. The first time with a guide, when we walked round the outside, the second time when we walked in the gardens and the third when we did both museum and gardens. (Nominal charge just for the gardens) it was within walking distance of our hotel, the Oberoi Grand. The third visit was on a Sunday and we had read it was very popular with Indians and it was. We also got a lot of requests for selfies with us which occasionally got a bit wearing. The information of the colonial history: East India Company etc was very extensive and detailed. Enjoyed our visits very much."
Cool,Victoria memorial hall is lovely place it was .great place Victoria memorial is built by British sarkar such a huge hall it was lovely place it was .I love the vibe there
Historical place,"A historical place, a must visit for tourists. The surrounding the memorial is a good place for family and friends. Though this place is mainly famous for couple's meeting ground. The museum inside has many nice things to see including old swords and muskets."
Nice Architecture,"Victoria Memorial Hall. The architecture is really good. Very good museum with a variety of swords and guns for display. Cleanliness needs to be improved. The green park outside the Hall is good. But the water collection was very dirty. Further, its better to avoid taking the kids to the Park as its a lovers paradise"
A must visit museum,The Victoria memorial has multiple things in the museum which is worth visiting and adoring. It is worth visiting.
One of the icons of Kolkata,"1. The gardens/park is one of the best green patches for morning/evening walks or jogging.Or you can just sit there and enjoy the pleasant breeze.2. The museum inside is also worth a visit.3. A visit to Kolkata is not complete without this.4. After dark, the lights bring out another facet of this beautiful building. As such, although you will not be allowed to go inside at night, seeing it from outside is also great.5. If you are driving your own vehicle, parking may be a problem.6. The angel on top was supposed to sing (indicator of hurricane speed winds). Thank God, never heard her sing."
Wonderful building and grounds,Such a pleasure to see the opulence of the period captured in a building. Basically British architecture with an obvious local influence. Exhibits are good but the highlight is the ambience of the building and grounds.
Queen Victoria,the most attractive and historical palace as well as the best tourist post in Kolkata. sarounding campus used to be always greenish along with lots of flowers decoration
Must see place in Kolkata ,"It is a magnificent victorian era structure in white marble.Surrounded by large open area,garden and water body one can imagine great British Empire.When we visited only some part of museum was open as renovation work was going on but whatever we saw,could give us insight into early days of British establishment which Kolkata experienced first in India.The museum has grand collection of British era manuscripts,paintings,weapons and other important information of those days.Those who are interested in history must come here and those who are not interested in history they should not be disappointed as there is a beautiful garden,sitting benches,lake etc for good photography and of course tasty street food just in front of memorial."
Average attraction Poorly maintained,As young person grew up in Kolkata was disappointed to see the Victoria Memorial in such a poor state of Maintainence. The marble is stained yellow the grounds are poorly maintained.
First choice in Kolkata,It could be your first choice in Kolkata to Handout. Nice architecture and good environment. Close to the city centre. You can spend a hours here.
Must See,"One of the few must see attractions in Kolkata. It is located in the central Maidan area close to Park street, the Kolkata race course, golf course and the zoo. Currently a part is under renovation. Must walk around, see the display inside, take a buggy ride and sample some street food."
Victoria Memorial,One of the iconic monuments of Kolkata.  Most of the movies and serials having storyline based on Kolkata will show a glimpse of this magnificent structure. It has inside the items on display of Victorian era. It has a beautiful garden and water bodies around it. Best place for outing with family on a holiday.
A historical palace,During the British period it was Queen Victoria's Palace.That is why it is called the Victoria Memorial.It's a historical place of Kolkata.Tickets price only 20 rupees.
Victoria,Some time with Queen Victoria's residence. Its a museum now and its definitely worthy to visit. Light and sound show available around evening which is also quite amazing.
Victoria Memorial Kolkata- Wonderful place to visit.,Victoria Memorial is a monument of British style It is Very crowdy particularly on Local Holidays. But it will be very helpful to understand the value and significance of this place if somebody has some knowledge of Modern Indian History. One of the important places in Kolkata to visit.
Morning tour,Namaste Being local I have been this place numerous time. Best time is to visit early morning with less crowd and better atmosphere ! Try to relax in garden area near monument for relaxation ! The museum is from British era ! The inside area is average just good for photo shooting !
Building and history,VM is a museum with lot of information on west Bengal region. we happened to follow a guide in between and found the service was free of cost..He was very good. Entire place is well maintained with no litters around. Nice lake and greenery inside for good photography.  Worth visiting if you are in Kolkatta
Amazing Structure,What an amazing structure beautifully preserved. Built in memory of Queen Victoria. The clouds that visit this monument yearly have not detracted from its beauty. At all angles around the building you are presented with another amazing sight.
Good lesson in history,"Nice for people who likes history. A bit expencive for foreigners (Inr 500/person). Good view from outside aswell, nuce for taking photoes/video."
Very unique enjoyable experience,"Since I live in Kolkata, I've visited the Victoria Memorial many times:with friends, family and also my journalism students, and each time was enjoyable and informative. In Kolkata, visiting the Victoria Memorial is a must-do outing. It's the best place to check our during the autumn - winter months (November - February). Check for the timings when it remains open from early morning till evening. Entry tickets are reasonably priced. It has lush open lawns and gardens to walk around, a museum and art gallery inside, replete with paintings, statues and memorabilia dating to British Colonial times. Victoria Memorial was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria (1819‚Äì1901). Built of white marble, it holds iconic stature in Kolkata, West Bengal, and was built between 1906 and 1921. Some important legal documents are on display inside the gallery; for instance the one announcing the change in British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.  Thousands throng the premises in winter months and sit around the large water body that is surrounded by lush trees and plants. The large imposing statue of Queen Victoria in the front adds its own aura. At night, the entire marble structure becomes even more enticing when blue lighting adds an ethereal glow. Not just visitors, locals also enjoy the ambience and come in droves, with family and friends to spend some 'fun time' here."
Victoria memorial ,Visiting KOLKATA and not going to Victoria memorial is simply unbelievable and unthinkable.  It is one of the most sought place to visit in KOLKATA.  It is an icon of KOLKATA
Amazing monument,We visited Victoria memorial and we were surprised to see that. It is beautiful white building. Garden is also very beautiful. We spent 2 hours there. We enjoyed very much. We eat puchka there very delicious. We also get a ride of horsecart. This trip always be in my heart. Victoria Memorial is a live symbol l of architecture
Great Architecture Victoria Memorial ,"We visited this place twice, the reason being the first time we visited was on Monday and they do not allow visitors inside the museum and also it was getting dark.Well maintained and really good architecture. Also the garden area is well maintained. The museum hosts some really good history.One of the must visit places if you are in Kolkotta."
Victoria memorial,it's a decent place to relive the colonial past when Kolkata was a great centre for trade and also had considerable political influence
Victoria memorial,Worst experience..the view from outside is great but nothing worth seeing inside..the upstairs rooms were under renovation..waste
just good for a walk,"it is about nonexistent glorious past, just go for a walk in the nice day, architecture reflects tastes of the departed so nothing spectacular"
Not a disabled friendly place,Surprisingly such a great monument is not easy access to wheelchair persons. The pebbles and lamp post makes it difficult to move around for wheelchair.
Good for an walk evening,The garden is a good places for walk. But the inside of museum is congested and musty and there is nothing much to see.
Lovely gardens and people!,It was lovely to walk through the gardens and view the memorial from every angle. The local population kept on asking for us to be in their photos and that was lovely.
Trip,"Nice location and very clean place, it‚Äôs good place to visit with kids , the garden and all maintenance is good, wonderful place with old memories"
True wonder,It a true wonder of Kolkata very relaxing and enjoyable place in Kolkata.  One must visit during weekend
Queen Victoria's Museum,This place are so beautiful. This Place Based On Queen Victoria Memories. Here Is Queen Victoria's Museum..
Looks beautiful but that's about it,Looks beautiful from the outside and has good old artifacts but that's about it. there is not much to do there but you can relax in the garden outside the Victoria Memorial.
The british aura,Beautiful and mesmerising monument...a lovely museum inside it.the greenery all around is specially breath taking.
Wonderful heritage ,One of the most famous place in Kolkata- the coty of Joy.  Had a wonderful time with its beauty though I am not expert in architectural things. Would love to be here again.
Popular historical place,You can get the feel of Old Calcutta under British Rule. Memorabilia of many great person's are on show...Beware of Pickpocketears....
Victoria Memorial,"Located in Kolkata, West Bengal. The Victoria Memorial is dedicated to queen Victoria and is a large white marble building. The building houses many galleries like the Royal gallery, Calcutta gallery with numerous portraits and exhibits.The memorial is located centrally in the city in the famous Maidan area and is also nearby Hooghly river. There is an entry fee to this place. Opening hours are from 10 A.M to 6 P.M except on national holidays and Monday's. A top tourist attraction in Kolkata with many historical offerings within."
We refused to pay the mad entrance fee..,The fee for UK citizens is ridiculous so we paid for garden-only entrance. The building and grounds are gorgeous and we spent a good couple of hours walking and relaxing outside in the sunshine.
Eye-catching,"The building is dedicated to Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India. White Makrana marbles were used in the construction of Victoria Memorial Hall.The Victoria Memorial is massive in its size and stands enclosed within blooming gardens. It has a Museum, Royal Gallery housing a number of portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and paintings illustrating their life, National Leader‚Äôs Gallery, containing the portraits and relics relating to Indian independence. Spectacular Creation.We could see the view of Hooghly Bridge from the gardens of Victoria Memorial Hall.Foods are available. The work of the palace is eye-catching.Peace Park, in front of Victoria Memorial, is a  nice, green and quiet spot"
Victorian Splendour,"Though it is a very good and excellent architectural wonder, nothing less than the Taj Mahal of Agra. Unfortunately the place could have been developed better for a great tourism experience. Maybe the Travel Agents World did Not see the proper tourism opportunity to promote in its proper perspective. Maybe the Ministry of Defence, which has the adjoining iconic Fort Williams of great historical importance, don‚Äôt want visitors for strategic security reasons or whatever."
I feel that i am in france,Every thing is maintain and looks like we are if france what a emolument very good place to see. Four side of building is like a ford shane kollkata.
Beautiful site; filled with history,"Visiting this museum with a local friend was very nice, as it showed me some of the vast history of the city, but also overwhelming. There are few rooms with air conditioning, so it was mostly hot and humid as we wandered the halls. It is a good-sized museum, with much to see, so be prepared to walk and stand a lot. Warning to foreigners (especially blond women): some locals will want to take photos with you."
Victoria memorial,"Last year on the 19th of October at 2:15 a.m., I reached the Indira Gandhi International Airport (in Delhi) to catch my flight for Kolkata. I felt both excited and nervous as I had never traveled on my own before then. I reached after couple of hours and did my work and reached Victoria memorial I was amazed by the beauty of Victoria memorial.The beauty of the architecture of Victoria Memorial is far-famed which makes it one of the best places to visit in Kolkata. So, I decided to go there first. ¬†Made up of white Makrana marble and encircled by beautiful gardens, this museum is constructed in the memory of Queen Victoria."
A must visit place,If u are in Kolkata don't miss this historical place . It's brilliant . The structure of Victoria memorial is mesmerizing and beautiful . Entry fee is around 10-20 and high for foreigners. I visited here with my friends and we all enjoyed a lot .
Nice historical place to visit,"Best palace to visit in Kolkata. It is located near park Street . It has a good history about the British time period and many old instruments, photos , artifacts are there which give you feel like you are in the period of 1800s. Nice place to visit . Sunday it is closed üòÇ"
Khajjiar Dalhousie,Surrounded with pine trees and mountains valley with a little water body. The valley is lush green some time the trees are covered with fogg. And some time it‚Äôs sunny.
A great landmark of the City of Joy,"Victoria Memorial needs no introduction. Built during the British Raj, this museum is a must visit place in the City of Joy. The lush greeneries around the place and the adjacent Maidaan area is absolutely mesmerizing"
An Oasis,"The gardens, are truly an Oasis in the desert of noise and chaos that is Kolkata. They open at 5.30, so one can take a walk before temperature's rise too high. Definitely worth a stroll!"
Victoria memirial,Dont bother. Poorly kept. A colonial vestige for the poor population to gawk at. Terrible ticketing service. No shelter from rain or sunAvoid
Historic place,Awestruck monument with a lovely lake. I love the vibe. Its better if you visit early in the morning or around 3-4 to avoid harsh sun rays and have a comfortable visit.
A good historical building.,I was here in mid august with family.The complex premises is very good.The outside view of this building is more attractive than inside view.It is just like a small museum where you can see many ancient things.My children had enjoyed very well.Overall a nice visit.

First visit,"Amazing place in Kolkata to visit , it was my first visit to Victoria memorial, really have lots to learn"
Beautifully preserved,Beautifully presented memorial where one can easily spend 2 to 3 hours lazily walking around the gardens.The memorial hall itself is quite interesting with two levels of viewing.

Great monument,"Excellent monument, neat and tidy, very informative museum, don‚Äôt need a guide.Nice garden around, clean toilets , must see place in  Kolkata"
Relive the History of Calcutta,A place to relive Calcutta when it was the captial of India. The place is very beautiful both from inside and outside. There's a museum inside the Hall with historical artefacts. You should visit if you are in Kolkata. One should know the history of Calcutta.
Elusive Utopia at the Architectural Masterpiece,"Kolkata city evokes some images ‚Äì images of its icons - and the most promising ones among those of the two icons ‚Äì Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge (leaving a plethora of them aside including those of the electric trams, rickshaw pullers and the famous puchkas).My childhood had been spent with umpteen visits to the Victoria Memorial ‚Äì and in those days, my father was neither very busy nor very rich. And as he rose in the corporate ladder, the time started becoming scarce and visits also reduced. But every visit was brilliant for the very long walks in the exquisite gardens of the Memorial ‚Äì which was followed by some great street food in the Maidan right opposite the gates of the memorial. The most famous among them was the Dal Vada (that had moved to Vardaan Market ‚Äì see its review), chana jor garam, Bhel Puri, Batata Puri, Puchkas and the Churmurs. Now every delicacy had a place in Kolkata where it was served right ‚Äì not very simple anymore! Those were days of innocence ‚Äì and days without gadgets or mobiles ‚Äì and days with hardly any needs worries or distractions. And hence numerous visits to the Memorial. But never did I remember entering the main precincts of the building ‚Äì it was out of reach. And now almost three decades later, I was here at the famous icon of the Kolkata ‚Äì back for good.A small crowd had thronged near the entrance gate. There were tickets only for the lawns and extra for the main Hall. For foreigners, the rates were significantly higher (Rs 30 vs Rs 500). After a wait of about 10 minutes or so, we entered the Memorial. The main lawns were magnificent and decked in myriad hues and colours. The cobbled stone walkways were as we had left ‚Äì though the stone count seem to have been diminished and parts of walkways were broken. There was plastic ban in the compound ‚Äì which was good thing. May be it is expected that a nationwide ban on single use plastic is coming soon ‚Äì good riddance of a catastrophic human blunder. Apart from lawns, there were small lakes in the grounds that provided excellent setting for this masterpiece.Inside the main hall, there was huge crowd that had built up ‚Äì to see numerous exhibits on displays ‚Äì there were holy books, old armoury, communication equipment, paintings, canons and what not. I had just been to the National Museum in London and this memorial administration could surely learn few tricks of trade. There was significant scope of improvement in how things should be displayed or how a museum should have been managed. There were places where the paint was peeling ‚Äì or the AC cables had made a mess of the venue (built at a time when AC possibly did not exist) ‚Äì or birds that freely flew inside the main hall ‚Äì or dustbins that were just not clean enough. Built between 1906 and 1921, the century old icon of Kolkata was classic case of elusive Utopia at an architectural masterpiece ‚Äì niggles here and there and here and there."
Marvelous creation of marble!,"Here you can define the difference of big, bigger and biggest. It's an awesome creation of British. My suggestion is not hire any guide to visit this site. S/he will spoil your sightseeing by lecturing history. You've feel this place by solely. Very nice garden and lake besides memorial will make you charm! It tooks minimum 2 hours to visit all the premise.  Very very beautiful place for tourist."
A beautiful monument,"Victoria Memorial is a landmark monument of the city of Kolkata. A small but wonderful museum inside, it boasts of lush green gardens outside the magnificent building. A favourite place for joggers and young couples, it attracts all kinds of crowd. With new Programme Consultant in place, some amazing events are being hosted here most of the time.Being an artist , I have had the privilege to perform at one of the quadrangles of the monument.A must visit for the tourists."
Wonderful Architectural Design,Visited there in July'2019 along with some of my friends and just loved the place . Such a wonderful place to visit in Kolkata

Amazing place to visit.,"Although I visited this place in summers, i was very happy with the way arrangements were done.Educated and wise visitors were there. The pebbles on the main road is amazing. Not very costly. Overall, I recommend everyone to visit there."
Good one,Though it was a rainy day - but we enjoyed the memorial hall trip all day. Nothing much to see but we were amazed by few collections specially those bones of animals.
WONDERFUL WHITE PALACE OF KOLKATA,"Its a very good memorial hall located in KOLKATA with beautiful surrounding gardens where you can take a fresh breath.A museum is also attached within Victoria compound, which also very nice to see."
The place which only kolkata has,The massive size of the gardens and the serene pond with birds flying over it is the best morning to start with. Located at the heart of the city with accessibility from all the possible conveyance by road. Must spend time if you get to visit kolkata. Best time to visit anytime except summer. INR 20 is the entry for the garden and INR 100 for the museum in the memorial hall.
Awesome structure,"Nicely designed structure, really shows us a glimpse of British rule in India and their contribution, it is really a worth watching monument and pictorial experience al together Just go for it for the memories"
Heritage Building,In  a nutshell Victoria Memorial  Hall is the heart of KOLKATA.Until you visit you can not imagine.Great monumental structure of eastern India.
Reminiscing Victoria Memorial,"In my lifetime, I went to Victoria Memorial 4 times. First time with my parents in 1985, second time with friends in 1994, third time with office colleagues in 2007 and last time in June 2019 with my elder son.First and last visit were exciting because in both cases father and son was involved."
Must go in Kolkata,Place is beautiful. During my visit was a little bit crowded but we managed to see everything. Reserve at least one hour for this visit. 500 rupees to get in (around 7USD).
Must visit place in Kolkata,"located at the heart of central Kolkata, this is a must visit place. all places including esplanade, national museum, birla planetarium, maidan and alipore zoo are very close to victoria memorial. please go with your own water bottle and plenty of time in hand. surrounded by very beautiful parks, this is a place best visited after 4 pm."

Lot of armoury is on display. The garden is well developed with vast lawns, large trees and a small stream flowing. This is a must see if you are in Kolkata. You can enjoy a lot of time relaxing with history and nature!!"
Interesting,"It was interesting to visit this place, weather was really hot so could not enjoy much. the monument is beautiful and should be visited by first time tourists interested in getting to the know the imperial history,"
Historic,"This was a highlight of my trip to Kolkata but only gave 4 starts as local rate is 40 rupees, foreigner rate 500! Gardens are nice and I enjoyed their collection of historic paintings."
Victorian Era masterpiece in the herat of Kolkata,"Made of White Marble this victorian era masterpiece is situated in the heart of Kolkata within a huge green compound with fountains that make it a favourite place for morning walkers.Just opposite are the Maidan and the fountain of Joy.Apart from Raj Era relics,the atmosphere of the place mesmerizes you.Definately worth a visit"
Slice of history,A history buff could easily spend the whole day here for the wealth of knowledge about the olden times. Well maintained.
A morning spent in Victoria,"One can go inside by paying INR 3-5 per person and spend the time by walking and strolling in the garden or by the side of the lakes. After 930am one can go inside and see the different pictures, photos, documents and other interesting things during Victorian Era on every day display"
Remains of a Grand Yesterday,"Superb Remains of a beautiful remains of Victoria who never visited Kolkata, erstwhile Calcutta. Must visit for anyone who visits Kolkata."
Kolkata's Pride,A well maintained beautiful structure from the British Era. Nothing much to see inside but the acres of green lawns around it give a charm to this beautiful structure.
Majestic,One of the legacy of the British empire that is still a must see for any visitor to Kolkata. Imposing structure very good for Photo Ops.
The Taj Mahal of Kolkata,Beautiful from outside...if u r running short on time...i suggest a round trip from the outside is good enough...its pretty less than average from inside...most hotels n malls have better interiors
Definitely worth a visit,This is a must-watch tourist attraction if you are in Kolkata. Well maintained and the staff is also quite cooperative. There are several picturesque sights in the memorial
With family,Really enjoyable journey. Lots of historical thing are there for watching and learning. Great design and art in the building which long years ago.

A tale told of the era gone,"A very good place maintained in the mid of the town, with lush green gardens, clean toilets and a very beautiful museum. Its a place to spend time with the family even in the evenings. Its closed every Monday."
Must see in Kolkata,Amazing museum displaying history of British Raj in India. I wish my school teacher had taken us here to teach history lessons! Make sure you get free tour guide. Guided tour is available every hour.
Essence of Kolkata,This is one of the very important building of Kolkata. Open blue sky his very attracting from this location.
British Era legacy,"Calcutta and Victoria Memorial are synomous with each other. Having passed the monument umpteen times on my previous visits to Calcutta, being high on the tourist list, i decided to visit the Museum this time though with mixed feelings- ""A building made by the British for the British""- I asked myself do i really want to visit this instead of the Indian Museum?? I'm glad i went as it gave a better understanding of the history of Calcutta, the city of my birth-pictures and accompanying writeups were well detailed"
A short visit,Recently had a 7 hour layover at Kolkata airport on way to Bangkok. So decided to visit queen Victoria memorial in maidan area.took a prepaid taxi to dumdum metro and then metro to maidan. Queen Victoria memorial is walkable distance from maidan metro. Entry fee is rs 50 for indians. Very beautifully kept pieces of history during British raj.gifts to queen Victoria r displayed here.part of the museum is partially air conditioned. Take ur time and enjoy the museum. Gardens around the memorial r very neat and well maintained.
Tour,"Lovely place,little touch of history, beautiful place too,but it is always crowded at every occasion. If you are in Kolkata for the first time then you should definitely visit this place."
most beautiful british landmark of kolkata,you must explore this beautiful architecture of kolkata. the museum is also very very nice. the whole area is simply beautiful apart from the typical hustle and bustle of the city.
A purposeful visit to the Iconic Heritage of Kolkata,"Last time I visited Victoria Memorial, it was with my ex boyfriend which was about 13-14 years earlier. I only had flashbacks memories of this place, the way I have of him.So, what made me visit this place again? It was not my intention to revive the lost relationship but to create one. My friend and his mother wanted to see Victoria Memorial and I am their tour guide for the day.So, a cool day of February (except Monday) was selected for three of us to visit one of the iconic heritage of Kolkata. It's an outing to know each other and perhaps his mother liking me a little bit more.( Ugh!!what a place to choose!!)The first confusion started when I entered at the wrong gate. They entered from the main gate ( 2 lions sitting in front) while I entered at the back gate side). It took me almost 10minutes to meet them with a little jog from my side to cover up the distance as quickly as possible. Lesson learned - be minute in planning, including gates!!As we entered, the left hand side of the museum had pre independent stories and pictures. Three of us all carefully scrutinized with occasional inputs from his mother. I nodded and smile like a fool as if I am getting my first lesson of History from her. The right hand side had paintings all over the world including a Monalisa.As you proceed toward the main hall you get to see different statues and artefacts. In the meantime, due to long hours of standing, she was feeling tired and they had benches to sit.We placed her there and took stairs to go upstairs. You could see the whole beautiful hall at a glance and I transcended to the Victorian Age while holding the hand of my Knight.As I write this review, I get to know from newspapers that Victoria Memorial is going to have over 2000 more artefacts and extended hours. There were lot of sections closed for revamp and anytime soon in June,2019- Kolkata is going to get it's popular tourist spot in a new avatar with more accessability to disabled.And as for my newly found relationship, we are going strong for 7months and his mother is little bit impressed by me, I presume as the picture I clicked of hers in front of Victoria Memorial is her WhatsApp Profile picture."
breathtaking,Ticket with museum is for 30rs and only garden is 20 rs. Gardens are well maintained . Stones laid down are not easy to walk on.Museum closes at 5 and food canteen at 4 pm. View is breathtaking . Visit inside to see more about the way people and british officers lived . Pictures of old city landscape and famous paintings are displayed.
History with exercise,"One of the most iconic symbols of Kolkata.It has a rich history associated with it and there is a museum inside. The gardens are very well maintained. And if you are interested is Morning walks or a breath of fresh air amidst the concrete jungle, then this would fit in perfectly. The lawns are spacious and there is enough space for young kids to run around.The place is equally mesmerizing when the lights are switched on in the evening. Finding a parking spot for your vehicle might be problematic as most of the roads around it has ""no parking"".The angel statue on top is supposed to whistle if there is a storm brewing, but I am not aware of anyone who has heard it personally.All in all, a nice place for an outing. And a must see if you are visiting Kolkata."
Visit in October,"It's a lovely place to visit and specially when the weather is pleasant and the clouds are clear. Established in 1921, Victoria Memorial Hall was dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria"
Pleasant early morning walk,"I bought the ticket for the gardens surrounding Victoria Memorial and not for the museum itself. It was a very pleasant early morning walk - warm spring air, birds calling, and the beautiful structure of Victoria memorial."
Awesome place to Visit,It is a very good historical place. Well maintained. Nice place to visit. If you visit Kolkata then you must come here.
Oh So Royal!,"So I was born and brought up in Calcutta and perhaps crossed this enchanting monument twice everyday of my school life when I was not on a holiday. I remember peeping out of the window to see the Fairy on top of the domw twirl just once! But, Alas!I went back now, almost 25 years out of school, this time vowing to myself I would go into the monument to see what I had missed!And I did not repent it one bit! Its a wonder! An architectural marvel and a work of outstanding geometric precision. It is an exemplary expression of Vistorian artistry, not to be missed for anything on this earth and in the city!However, my two bits of advice would be- read about the place before you go! Do not expect a guide beacuse we found none! If you are aware of what you are walking into the delight would be deeper and more heartfelt!"
A must-see tourist spot,"It‚Äôs one of the city's biggest landmarks. It's situated in Heart of the City. Built in the memory of Queen Victoria, this beautiful structure is a museum and a tourist attraction. A very nice place and constructed with white marble. Monday is closed."
Beautiful place,"Place to visit in kolkata, beautiful place with the touch of British construction. Perfect place to visit here is in evening time"
"Built by our opressors , beautiful nevertheless","The monument is jo doubt glorious and beautiful, but it pains the heart that it was built at a time when our country was in extreme poverty and famines were commonplace .  Though the britishers built it to further their own legacy, it is an indian monument today and thus mist be cherished. The good thing we can learn is how to preserve our past and heritage ,the same way the british have ensured even when they have left our country"
Nice,Victoria Memorial is a famous and well known memorial hall of Kolkata.Huge area and reasonable entry fee.Their is also a museum inside the hall which charges extra entry fee.This is a nice spot for get together and spending time.
Combination of British and Mughal architecture,"The Kolkata Victoria Memorial is one of the city's biggest landmarks. Built in the memory of Queen Victoria, this beautiful structure is a museum and a tourist attraction.The structure is constructed using a combination of British and Mughal architecture known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, an architectural style that was followed in British India in the late 19th century. It is one of the most famous tourist place of Kolkata."
Monday is closed,"Do not go on Mondays as this is when they close, all other days are opened. However if you go on MOnday, there is plenty of happiness in walking though the gardens which they keep open for a small fees. There is an artificial  lac and lots of trees giving shade and fresh air when the city is hot boiling. There are birds that you can also watch. We could not visit the Museum inside. Will return next year"
NICE BUILDING BUT NOTHING TO SEE,Very disappointing since the building is so nice but inside: NOTHING interesting! To add insult the admission for foreigners are something like 10 times higher ( forgot exact amount but maybe even more ) than local visitors!
Historical place ,Never thought it will be so big and amazing to look at. Great historical place to visit. You can roam around the garden which is also large enough.
Victoria Memorial Hall is a MUST to see,"Victoria Memorial Hall is a MUST to see in Kolkata. I suggest that you allow more than one hour inside to read the stories on the walls that describe the history of India and the colonial times. The inside is well maintained, and outdoors is a beautiful well-groomed garden"
Beautiful place,"Lovely place, very well maintained, good to visit during evening, good to see our history with all the available information and related documents and weapons ..  , nearby good shopping place like esplanade... Love shopping there.."
Iconic place for the city Kolkata,This place is beautiful... Truly an incredible architecture... You will get to know a lot about history.. What a monument.. One small problem is the place is little crowded. Over all amazing place... You will definitely  appreciate the architect who built it.
Big and crowded,"This is a very impressive and indeed over the top piece of colonial excess. It needs to be seen, but for Western visitors hardly worth going inside. The museum which occupies all of the area open to the public is rather poor and of little interest. The crowds made it a chore to walk around.Best just stay outside and take photos."
"Victoria Memorial, Kolkata",It's situated in Heart of the City. A very nice place and constructed with white marble. Presently a number of people with bad intention visit the place which brings bad name to the city. Galleries are there.A awful contribution of British Empire.
A must in Kolkata,"Beautiful monument, a must for any visitor to the city.Beautiful gardens, best if visited not in May or June."
Mesmerizing architecture ,"Victoria memorial is a great piece of architecture. The garden around it, the lakes, the squirrels, the birds everything was so peacefully surrounds it. The statues was well planted. I love the calm and quietness in the middle of the chaotic Kolkata"
Beautiful structure,It‚Äôs a beautiful structure at the heart of Kolkata which is reminiscent of the British heritage that was once present in this region. The visit is worthwhile but the tour is a bit short.
Victoria ,"Great place to visit,  if u are in kolkata it's a must visit,  also u can goto the maidaan in front of it"
A must visit in kolkata,Victoria memorial is dedicated to queen elizabeth by the then british government and its made of marble. Building is surrounded by a well maintained garden.
Unmissable stunning white marble monument,"This Kolkata landmark, which is a memorial built for Queen Victoria, is a must visit. Set over 57 acres of garden (not all of it is open to the public), the marble memorial, with beautiful statues on all sides, really stands out. There are free hourly guided tours for the museum inside, where you might be pleasantly surprised by the Indian and Western paintings and memorabilia. The gardens are open to the public from 5.30 AM till 6 PM and the museum opens from 11 till 6."
Victoria Menorial,"Victoria memorial is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Kolkata.This white marble structure looks dazzling during the day and equally mesmerizing at nighttime.The structure has been very well maintained and is a delight to watch even from a distance. With a beautiful dome, the structure houses a museum with statues, paintings, weapons, canons of the British era. The gardens outside are beautiful with small water bodies which can serve as a great picnic spot."
Iconic landmark of Kolkata,"Very stately and magnificent building, not ornate, simple and classic in style.  The Calcutta Gallery in the right wing has lots of information, photos, prints and paintings of the history of Calcutta.  Must visit"
Excellent ,Beautifully made! Went with friends enjoyed a lot. Loved the environment and ambiance. Building is so old but yet maintained
Uti meeting,Very good service and ambience. Himangshu and Chimsang Surujit are very cordial and supportive. Food quality specially vetki and gur baked rasgulla were nice. Special mention for cleanlyness.
Place for History lovers,Beautiful building but not well maintained. You feel suffocation inside the building and couldn't stay inside for long.
Victoria Memorial - An Excellent Place in Centtral Calcutta,"The Victoria Memorial is a huge and attractive marble building in central Kolkata, India, Victoria Memorial was built in the beginning of twentieth century between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria and is now a museum and attractive tourist destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture.  Victoria was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. On  the top the central dome of the Victoria Memorial there is the Angel of Victory.I visited with my wife, son and grandson after Birla Planetarium. My son and grandson went inside the gallery while with my wife I was seated on bench where we were sitting many times before marriage. We were recalling the past looking at lake in front of the Victoria Memorial.Victoria Memorial is itself a landmark surround by St Cathedral road, Queens Way, Calcutta Race course.Caution: Photography is allowed inside the garden but not inside the gallery to protect the paintings."
beautiful building,"you must enter by front door, dont walk around to side entrance, as no ticketing there. If short on time you may not find entering worthwhile, as mainly art in museum part and to see murals you have to able to climb up towards Dome to see them clearly.Best part for me."
Interesting but not top of my list,Its a lovely old building with a very small museum. Worth visiting but you won't need very long here. The gardens are lovely though.

The face of Kolkata,Whenever there is any mention of Kolkata in any papers or video almost always the first thing that is shown is the Victoria Memorial . It is a remnant of bygone Colonial rule and an architectural marvel. The Memorial grounds are beautiful and one has to keep this in their bucket list if he/she visits the city of Joy!!!
Awesome place,Its a great structure and there are lot of information about Indian History but the interiors smell real bad. Bengal Govt need to take care of it.
Gardens Only,"Another attraction where foreigners have to pay loads more than Indians (regardless of their financial status), Rs.25 /  Rs.500 if you want to go into the museum, or just pay Rs.25 to walk around the gardens. The gardens are lovely and the museum is great to photograph from the outside. No need to go into the museum."
Casual visit for one hour,It is one of the master piece in marble .It is the pride of Kolkata.Very well maintained .One can know of colonial past of Kolkata .It is also refered as the tajmahal of eastern India.
Most popular tourist attraction in Kolkatta,Tourism in kolkata is incomplete without visiting Victoria Memorial. Beautiful British architecture and Lush green garden makes it a perfect tourist place.must visit place
Peaceful gardens.,"Victoria Memorial Hall and Gardens are walking distance from New Market and definitely worth a visit. Also close to the planetarium and St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, both worth a visit. Garden entry is just 20rupees/‚Ç¨0.27approx. Nice for relaxing or taking pics, be prepared though tourists are a little like celebs at most attractions in India. You will be asked for many selfies and to join family pics... ‚ò∫Ô∏èüì∏"
Awesome Place,"Victoria Memorial is one of those places in Kolkata where we will get the peace of mind please back when I visited this place with some of my friends for the 50-60th time I guess ,yet I was mesmerized with it's heritage and Beauty.This  place has it's  impression that can't be compared to others."
Good stay,Gery good hotrl.pleasant stay and vomfortable stay.all staff are good.Specially arpita as lssd's o good.Vidit soon
Beautiful Building,"A wonderful building to look at from the outside, but then when you enter it is even better. The museum section is very interesting"
Excellent ,A treasure and well maintained. Very easy to go around and tickets are easily purchased at the gate.
Historical place,Very beautiful place for the travellers who love to click pictures.  I really enjoyed my tour over there
Must Visit once,"We visited this beautiful place in the month of December. It looked so beautiful and also really historic.If you enjoy history and reading then you can easily spend around 4hrs here,  but you are not much into reading then you will simply see the place and come out in an hours time.There are a few things which you want to see then will have to take staircase, which are tough for old people snd heart patients.If you are going with an infant then, avoid taking pram as you won't be able to go to level 1 with it.The entry is super cheap for Indians and evenings lights especially during Christmas time are worth watching.Enjoy this place once and there is ample of place and good benches to sit outside.You can enjoy the cool breeze during winters."
Spectacular edifice in a lush garden,Bright marble celebration of the British Raj with statues of all the main players of the late 19th and early 20th century.  A great experience inside and out.
Terrible experience ,I was with my 7 year old son and wife.Unfortunately our private taxi diver did not guide us and just dropped us at St. Pauls Cathedral and said he would park there and Victoria memorial is just opposite.Once on the street we asked at least 5 different citizens who gave us vague directions.Finally a security guard of one small gate misled us into the garden and we walked in the midday sun for some 800 mtrs to a gate where another guard said it would open only at 3 pm..we managed to get out of the garden and on the street and  our taxi driver picked us up from there.We were so exhausted that we just saw the structure from one of the gates from outside.Worst experience of a historic structure of my life.!!!The locals I asked for directions were clueless about the two access gates.Please get dropped only in front of either gates..ignorant citizens and lazy and insensitive taxi driver!!!Bad..bad bad experience in this city of Joy?????
Too Noisy,This is a very interesting place to visit but unfortunately there were hundreds of school children and this made it very noisy.A must if you are interested in the British connection in India.
Stunning beauty ,What a beautiful place for pictures and falling in love . Very scenic and quiet. Architecture is beautiful.
An interesting reflection of the British Raj,"This is more than a memorial, it is huge and full of interesting material explaining the British Raj and it's occupation of India. It costs 500 rupees to get in if you are not Indian (they pay 100). the surrounding gardens are a quiet haven from the manic streets of Kolkata outside. Definitely worth a visit. There are only two entrances into the park, one at the north side and one at the south."
Tajmahal - like.....,"It is a white marble monument; looking at it, Taj Mahal comes to your mind instantly.  But this is a really imposing structure.  Once you are inside the sheer height is awe-inspiring.There is a sprawling garden all around.  Over all a nice place to spend time."
Palace Type Marble Monument,"This historical monument was built by Britishers in memory of British Queen Victoria, now is a Museum.  Structural Large design and exquisite marble carvings are worth seeing.   Front side is beautiful with garden and  items displayed inside(Museum) also is wonderful."
Great architecture,This is the most famous attraction in Kolkata. There is museum in the building with statues of Queen Victoria and others. The architecture is brilliant. There are gardens all around the campus. Bad part is no good food options and that too it is available only after 1 pm. Atleast they should sell cool drinks to the customers before 1 pm. It is delight for photographers as they get to shot some stunning photos from various angles. There is an arch at the entrance.
Nice place to visit,It is british era bulding with big garden full of flowers. the place is nicely maintained and a must to see place in Kolkatta
"VICTORIA MEMORIAL,KOLKATA","It is a large ""Marble Building"" in Kolkata,West Bengal,India.This was build between 1906 and 1921.It is dedicated to the memory of ""Queen Elezabeth""(1809-1901).The memorial lies on the maidan(Grounds) by the bank of river ""Hoogli"".Near is Chouringhee Road.Thousands of people come and visit the building which has become and icon of Kolkata.If I go to history of this memorial the first ""Baron Curzon of Kedlestone the then Viceroy of India suggested the creation of a memorial.

World class monument ,"It is a historical monument. A day is not enough for a student or admirer of history to see it. Take a small notebook and make notes. Weekdays should be ideal if you want to see it leisurely. Please don't use cameras inside, be responsible"
Still same look,"Known for beauty of Kolkata,fully white marble surrounding covered with very good land scaping, well maintained"
A must Visit in Kolkata.,Excellent place having historical values and awesome architecture which makes you feel good. Perfect place to spend quality time with near ones in a lovely evening. You can also enjoy the beauty of water show in the garden just beside this.
A trip down the memory lane during Victorian era,A nice museum to visit along with family and especially young kids. There are several historical artefacts.
Beautiful ,Well worth a visit to this ‚ÄòTaj of the Raj‚ÄôBeautiful gardens and such an impressive monument. Museum inside also has a great exhibition.
Exhibits are in dull light,"Nearly after 44 years I visited Victoria Memorial hall, with lot of curiosity and great old memories of my college years. But not that happy. The grand wide garden around the hall is not taken much care. No one fountain is working.Inside the hall those great sculptures are not illuminated properly. The arts and some antiques are kept too far to the visitors, so that not able to read the descriptions of those items. Such a great heritage building should have given more focus and attention by the archeological department or the relevant responsible department."
Great collection,Myself and family enjoy a lot. Great collection. It grains knowledge of mine and chield.Security man behavior is not advisable. 2 - 3 persons (including 1 lady security) were very rough talking / behavior. needs to improve. Overall good experience
Very beautiful green heaven in the midst of cocrete jungle,Its a place that has a very special place in my life. I have grown up seeing my dad and uncle go there for morning walks and now that's the place I work out every mrning. The structure is breathtakingly beautiful and well maintained pride of Kolkata.However it does get crowded on weekends and festivities as there is an influx of rural travelers.
Photoshoot,Went here for a photoshoot of my kid. Really well maintained and beautifully kept.It's actually a great place for clicking pics.
Place for photography,Amazing place for photography ...a cultural heritage surrounded with soo many types of trees... Cool breeze flows from Ganges situated beside... So many things to look around here the architecture and the museum inside has so many things to learn from...
Must visit,"It is a beautiful monument surrounded  by a huge expanse of well laid out gardens. It is in good condition and well maintained. The central hall has a beautiful dome, houses a stately statue of Queen Victoria and there are some breathtaking paintings illustrating the milestones in Victoria's life along the base of the dome. Do climb up to the gallery to get a better view of the paintings and the ceiling of the dome. The other halls have a lot of displays, pictures, artefacts etc of the history of that period. There is a beautiful plaque giving the wise proclamation of the Queen made in 1858. The words are applicable even today."
Mesmerised by beauty,This is the most beautiful place of architecture as this place is having very good halls and gardens where the flowers are numerous and I was really mesmerised here in Kolkata
Victoria beauty,I visited here last month and enjoyed watching Victoria Hall and gardens spread over acres of land in kolkata
The iconic Victoria Memorial Hall,The Victoria Memorial is the iconic architectural heritage of Kolkata. Certainly a must-visit if you are on your maiden visit to Kolkata. There is ample greenery and open spaces. However the memorial itself leaves you feeling that it could have been preserved better.
Memorial of queen Victoria,I visited here last week for the first time and was amazed to see the Victoria hall with acres of land surrounded by numerous flowering gardens I really loved the place in Kolkata West Bengal
I loved the place,Iconic symbol of the city. It is one of the best heritage place in the middle of busy city. The best thing about this place is the wonderful architecture of the monument. Victoria Memorial is known worldwide built during British rule in India for the queen. Today it is an iconic and landmark build as well as serve as a museum. The white behemoth has some splendid architectural features.
Beautiful Architecture,"It's out of my expectation , the total architecture fascinated us very much. Nothing to explain about historic value. It's also an idle place for the people who are interested for photo shoot ,"
Places of couple,"You can visit there with family, friends, colleague, but the best to visit with couple. It's best for the romantic couples. You can see the beautiful garden. It's a memorable place at the time of queen Victoria in power. Inside the hall you can see the historical weapons, maps, dresses, the demo of life style of Britishers."
Outstanding building,This is one of Kolkata's old architectural buildings that has been well looked after.  We only wandered around the encircling park & gardens and did not venture inside but it is quite an impressive building.
Beautiful building unfortunately is not maintained properly,I was disappointed when I have visited the ground. There was gravel everywhere. It would really difficult for wheelchair user to access. As for top attraction in Kolkata it should be better looked after. Rubbish and unfinished work really spoiled the experience. The staff were keep blowing they whistles and shouting at the visitors. I felt like I was at the swimming pool with this amount of noise.
"Beautiful grounds, interesting museum","As you visit the Victoria Memorial Hall you will find a vast beautiful grounds.  It's being maintained every day.  There are beautiful flowers, statues, and waters.  Inside the building is a museum with some original photography, statues of famous English nobility, and then some additional art from the time from the area, and some cannons.  If you wanted to fully view all of the museum, it would take about 2-3 hours.  We didn't view all of the museum fully and were able to walk through it in about an house, but didn't get to read all of the history in one of the rooms that goes along with the art."
Looking back amidst nature,A treasure trove of historical artefacts housed within an architectural landmark amidst lush greenery....an oasis of calm right in the heart of the city. A must see for all residents and visitors in the City of Joy-Kolkata.
"Stunning architecture, long queues",A trip to Kolkata is not complete without a trip to Victoria Memorial Hall. We visited in the morning and there was a long queue for tickets. The only time I was hassled by beggars was waiting in this line. The site can be crowded depending on the day/time. Target enough time to stroll through the grounds. It's a lovely place to sit under a tree and relax.
A must,The beauty of this place still shines. Hope the indian government can preserve it in future. Require more systematic arrangements and nice lights.
