One of Identities of Awadh,"A very beautiful Awadhi architecture masterpiece, certainly Lucknow’s most photographed place. However this structure needs good maintenance to keep its glory."
A grand gateway,"This grand gateway has beautiful architecture and is the entry point to the city.  It's size is impressive and there seems to be a marked difference in the atmosphere on the two sides of the gate.We walked with our guide from inside the city though the gateway to the outside - it is quite exceptional.  On the inside, of course, you will be greeted by the numerous horse pulled carriages where you can buy a guided city tour."
"Architechtural landmark, the USP of lucknow",The very good place comes under the heritage zone of Lucknow. very lively in the evening time. A must-see.
Awesome ,Rumi darwaza is one of the famous darwaza and one of the best darwaza beautiful must watch this ek khawat hai jise na Da maula usa de ashf ud daulah
Rumi Darwaza,Rumi Darwaza is a very good place to visit atleast once. The architecture is wonderful and should be visited.
Door,Rumi Darwaza in the heart of Lucknow looms over the busy everyday traffic of Lajpatnagar. It is very famous among all of ages
Marvellous,Located on through fare  near Imambaras  this is a great photo opportunity place with much to see .Superb architecture .
Old world charm ,"A symbol of Lucknow! A gateway made in a beautiful Awadhi style is a must visit place when you are in Lucknow. Situated in between Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara, it takes you to 19 th century charm. If you have affinity for old culture you will live this place."
SYMBOL OF NAWAB,A good example of fine architecture of Nawab empire Mixed style architecture of mughal and European And standing with its own style
Big Gate,This is a big gate near bada imambada. The structure was magnificent. The gate is on the road. There is traffic going through this gate.
Good,Rumi darwaja is beautiful . It was huge and my kids also liked it . There was huge traffic there . Never saw such huge and beautiful darwaja ...
It's a huge gate,"We visited this along a list of other attractions when we landed at Bada Imambara. The private guides out there will take you along a 1.5 km journey from Rumi Gate, to Clock Tower and over the Gomti river front. They will say they are taking you to show how Chikan(embroidery) is done, but they will just take you to a shop, which sells finished goods.The Rumi Gate is huge - the front and back designs are completely different. You'll find many vehicles stopped on the side, with groups of friends taking photos."
Old Gate,"Lukhnow has too many Mugal darwaja like this. We passed many times through Rumi Darwaja, not noticed it because you see several of them around bada imamabara."
Magnificent ,The Rumi is part of the gigantic palace complex of the rulers of old. The architecture is stunning and the scope and scale overwhelming. It is well worth seeing.
Gate in the middle of the road…,Rumi Darwaza is one off the iconic attractions of Lucknow. It is an intricately carved door which is right in the middle of the road and has traffic going across it.
A short visit to feel the history,Grand gate built with an impressive architecture. Winters are a perfect time to visit. Nearby is immambara. Also tonga ride is a good experience. Quite clean and broad way it is and gives a glimpse of old lucknow. Nearby there are lot of chickenkari shops but don't try those as they tend to sell some cheap stuff.
Very famous landmark,This is very famous landmark in Lucknow. It is famous for its architecture. Good for first time visitors. Well cleaned and maintained place.
"Stunning, but hard to get a close look at",The Rumi gate is still in use and the road is busy and active. Unless you go at dawn its hard to get a close look at it. It is stunning
Just a gate,Nothing so special about this place just a gateway designed in Mughal architecture..You can have few clicks near the gate and also the clock tower is nearby ..I would like to mention here that the auto driver outside the gate will purposely drag you to a few textile shop which they are commissioned from..
Impressive gate,You can only drive through and stop the car long enough to take pictures and appreciate what it must have been like to enter the city through it. It is impressive enough nowadays
Exciting,"From the Bara Imambara, we hopped onto a tanga, & made our way to the Rumi Darwaza. Our excitement was doubled with our first horse carriage ride & the grand gateway ahead of us.The Rumi Darwaza is a gateway built under the patronage of the same Nawab & in the same year as the Bara Imambara. The front facade is a fine, fine example of Awadhi architecture!As it's an operational gateway, you've to be careful of traffic. There's no ticket to see the Rumi Darwaza."
Good to see,Worth the visit ... no fees as the traffic drives through it. Get a local tour guide to give you the background info
Impressive in size,This is the great ornamental gate of the Bara Imambara. The scale is impressive and there is much to explore. The whole architectural group here includes a huge mosque. No cameras allowed when we visited and a head scarf was not required.
One for the history buffs,"This is a huge monument right next to the Bara Imambara. You can walk to the mammoth gate. no tickets, not gates. Traffic uses the gate so you need to hop on and off the road a bit. The structure is humongous and beautiful. For history buffs, there enough to read and learn about the place, but for a regular tourist it may not amount to much except for a few pictures."
Peaceful place,"Roomi gate built in 1784 is one of the most peaceful architecture in lucknow and is now used as the symbol for city of NAWABS.It used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City, but as the City of Nawabs grew and expanded, it was later used as an entrance to a palace which was later demolished by the British insurgents."
Historic ,Ancient place of historic importance. Architecture is good and it’s part of heritage of the city of Lucknow. Take a few snaps there and move on. Nothing much special for common people but for history lovers it’s important place.
Simple ,This is one bigish gate... it is ornate and stands between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara. It is a 5 min visit only.  You dont need any ticket or anything to see it. The place is of historic value. But basic and simple. Lots of cycle rikshaws hurdle around here.
Beautiful,You can walk from Chota Imambara via Rumi Gate to Bara Imambara. It has too many cars parked in front but it is a beautiful gate.
Outstanding City gate,This is a very outstanding City gate loading to bara imambara. The  promenade with cobbled streets leadings in to the old city before this gate is amazingly colonial reminding us of European City. Great.
You should once visit to witness this ,"I must say that if you are in Lucknow, you should once visit this place to see its architecture, it’s really nice if you know a little bit about this place. This was actually built in 1784 - 86, it has approx 69 feet entrance and looks really great once you cross this.. many vehicles go it from this gate as its in in the middle of the road.. also people say that there is no visible support to this high entrance.. make sure you also pass this gate.."
great,"my experience was great, i roamed all around the area which was surrounded with epic things. lovable place to shop for cheap and ethnic stuffs."
Great art work,This gate defines the beauty of mughal times. If we see this design up side down it looks like chicken work. Which is one of the famous design of Lucknow. Great source of income during mughal empire.
Was expecting more but it's fine! ,"This is a specially made Darwaza or door on the main road which is no more a spot to stand and click photos or do something there, you can pass through the door as that's the only road for all the vehicles to pass through! Could have made a podium or something to click photos !"
Iconic and landmark gateway,"Rumi Darwaza is an architectural marvel and an iconic landmark gateway of the city of Lucknow.  This was built by Nawab Asaf-Ud-daula during the late 18th century.  There was severe drought conditions for several years in Lucknow during those days and to help the people earn money, the Nawab decided to built this iconic structure.  11 years' period was consumed in building this gateway.  In order to let people continue to earn livelihood, the Nawab used to get construction works done during day time and destruction partially during the night hours so that maximum period is consumed and help in the form of wages can be accorded for the betterment of the public at large.  It is a huge structure and traffic pass through this.  It is adjacent to the Bada Imambara."
Impressive ,The impressive mughal gate is certainly worth checking out and there are many other historic Islamic buildings in the surrounding area.
Place eflects Nawabi Architecture and beautiful work,"Its transit for small vehicles, yet its must visit. Best if you can step out and behold ancient beauty."
A Hurried Trip,The Darwaja is located next to the Bara Imambara. It presents different views from the front and the back . The area around is not well maintained. A road passes through it .
Beautiful architecture ,It's a beautifully built door on the middle of the road and seemed nice to drive through it. The road is extremely wide and we'll maintained. I would suggest you to avoid the private guides who'll just not stop following you and would give inaccurate facts about this place. It's better you visit this place without one. The private guides here are a scam.
Rumi darwaza: the symbol of Lucknow!,"Standing gracefully near the Bara Imambara, the Rumi darwaza, has a unique architecture. Give some time to appreciate its beauty!"
GATEWAY OF LUCKNOW,Its really amazing and very huge. Its looking like RAJ MAHAL. Nice to see this beautiful historical place.
Gateway to enter Imambara,"See the art and architecture of the building, mehrabs, stone used to built the gate.  It has three gates with such heights through which trucks could drive easily."
Beautiful.,After completing a great tour of Bara Imambara my cousins took me to the Museum and on the way there we went through this beautiful historical gate.  It was a treat to see this beautiful gate and learning the history.
Nice Architecture but requires cleaning of surrounding area,"Nice Architecture but towards chota imam bara and chants Ghar it becomes a toilet , place requires cleaning and traffic control"
lucknows best example of avadhi architecture,its one of the best example of awadhi architecture and is easily related to the name of  lucknow.a must visit
"Magnificent structure, good to see from a distance","Located between the Clock Tower and the Bara Imambara, it is architecturally beautiful.You can get a good view while walking or driving past from the Clock Tower to the Bara Imambara or vice versa.Do stop and have a good look to appreciate the architecture. It is a 2 minute attraction, and is also visible from the Clock Tower and from the Bara Imambara.The traffic is very chaotic and heavy in the evenings from 5 pm, and finding a parking spot is difficult."
Good experience,"Nice place to visit. Place is near Bada Imambara. Many other places. Clock Tower and Chicken Cloth Factory, Nimbu Park is good places to visit. Darwaja is historically and artistically very important landmark. This darwaza has been filmed for Film Gaddar and shown as Lahore Gate. This information given to us by Guide."

An insight into the heart of Lucknow,This place has an environmental benefit rather than anything. Here you can learn the historical legacy of the city while visiting to different parks and sit thrus that give you peace and relaxation.
Classical Architecture,Just near the Imambara. Once it was the entry point to Lucknow. Prefer to see it in late evening when illuminated by lights.
RUMI DARWAZA,"Rumi Darwaza,Built by Nawab Asaf us daula in 1784, is a historical monument near Bada ImamBada, Lucknow. Takes you back in time showing the brilliance of awadhi architecture. It has a big lantern on top of it which lights this monument at night. Definitely a place to visit in Lucknow."
Sightseeing,Rumi Darwaza is located in front of Bada Imambada. Nice place to click some photos. The architecture is different from both sides
Gateway which is like 2 sides of coin ,Gateway has intricate designs carved in it.. Both sides of the gateway are different.. Iconic landmark of Lucknow.. Premises is not maintained well but worth a visit.
Iconic Victory Arch.,The Arch is synonomous with Lucknow & is modelled on one of Istanbul's gates to Asia Minor. It was constructed under the auspices of Nawab Asaf-ud-daula 7 straddles the road neat the Bara Imambara. As well as being of massive dimensions it is host to some beautiful carvings.
Beautiful gate ,Rumi Darwaza is a beautiful gate built by the Nawab of Lucknow. It is designed in such a way that it looks like a 3-4 storey building from one side and once you cross the gate and look around. The view is completely different. You see a single huge gate with such beautiful carvings. It is a real delight for one’s eyes.
Landmark of Lucknow,This is considered to be a landmark of Lucknow and is located right close to the bada Imambara. Basically it's also forms a part of local Road in Lucknow. Many historical places are within a kilometre  around
A well suited identity for Lucknow,"This Turkish gate, built under the patronage of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula stands as the identity of Lucknow city. It provides a fitting entrance to the palacial complex of the Nawabs. It was designed in Turkey and has been named after a Muslim sufi saint, Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. I personally have a lot of appreciation for the grandeur of this gate. With the recent renovations in the area, this gate is now accessible from all sides and there is an open sit-out area next to it which allows the visitors to enjoy this place in the evenings."
The great Gate,Very fine example of the old style. And looks awsome as it spans that main thorough fare. Well preserved
Door of benevolence,"Constructed by the nawab to give labour to his people during a famine. Both it's facades are different. On one side are 3 orifices while on the other is the famous single door.Made with lentil as one of the ingredients, it also has clove replicas all over the structure."
Its simply beautiful!,we drove past this both during the day and night and it is simply magnificent! loved the detailing and architecture! it has a lovely charm to itself.
Imposing Gateway,Rumi Darwaza is a magnificent sample of awadhi architecture. It was built under the patronage of the nawab of awadh. A must visit.
Grand indeed,Very grand... especially if you can imagine a train of elephants and mounted soldiers entering the city in old history... a must stop by
Good place,Lucknow's wisdom and culture are unmatched. Rumi darwaze is one of the most satisfying places I have visited. Garden surrounding this monument are clean. It always makes me peace when I spend a couple of hours here.
Historical Architecture,It's an road which leads to Imambara and Ghantaghar. It looks amazing but it is not maintained well. There is visiting charges but reaching early will help you to click some amazing pictures. If you are visiting Imambara and driving your own car you get parking at Rumi Darwaza. You can also hire a horse ride to take a spin around near by places and charges are very minimal.
Poor Maintenance ,Although the gate is majestic but it needs urgent attention. The thoroughfare should be out of bound for cars and bikes.It is well known structure at Bada Imambada and can be seen in many movies shot at Lucknow.
Rumi Darwaza,Breathtaking beauty but amidst a busy roadside . Have to be careful regarding the traffic especially during rush hours
Great historical palce,It's a great historical place in Lucknow. I enjoyed here with family and friends. Highly recommended for weakened holiday.
Beautiful but requires maintenance...,Located just outside of Bara Imambara in Old Lucknow...this area is definately worth visiting to appreciate the beautiful architecture.
Unforgettable,"At times when the sun is not scorching, preferably around dawn or dusk, you would simply love to stare at the architecture, ignoring surrounding crowd or traffic."
Hugh entrance !,we passed there in our car+driver+guide as part of our tour and we took some photos but did not get down.
Gate with a difference.,It is just 10 minutes to see this darwaza the gate. on one side it is mohamedian aechitecture and from other side it is indian. it is a mere entry ans exit gate constructed in unison. even after three centuries they stand tall. worth viewing.
Mughal Architecture ,"It is close to Bara Imambara of Lucknow. A huge gate of about 60 ft height. As we got down from the local autorickshaw, a young guide approached us for a guided tour of Rumi Darwaza,Clock Tower  and Shahi Bawli. It was a short distance covered by a battery run small auto rickshaw. All these three huge architectural beauties reminds us about the rich nawabi heritages of old Lucknow. Somehow people go back to the history...the olden times."
Just another GAte,"Only if ur local guise creates interest by the history of the architecture of the gate, it will create a buzz, else it is just another pass way to the imamabra in old city."
Nice place to visit,You can travel on e rickshaw and visit all sites nearby but please beware of guides of rickshaw drivers who want you to divert from your plan and take you to particular shop of lakhnawi clothes.

evolution of the kurta neck designs,the entire gate when seen upside down it shows how the neck designs of the kurtas started. its just a gate in the heritage area of Lucknow next to the Bara and Chota imambaras
Designed as inverted Naulakha Haar!,"Rumi Gate is made in the design of a Naulakha haar, inverted. Also designed like the Lucknow famous Chikankari embroidery work. Very close to Bara Imambara, it has a beautiful setting to see the city passing by the gate. From one end, you can see the four stories of the architect whereas from the other end, it is the only one piece. A true marvel."
Classic Arch gate,"Rumi Darwaja is part of the complex housing Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara and on the passage from one to the other. It had one main arch and two side arches, meant for passage of elephants and horses during the Nawab rulers."
Must see,"There is nothing special, but if you are already in Lucknow, you must see it. Crazy traffic and massive people...."

The Rumi darwaza,A grand gateway 250 ft wide and about 100 ft tall for passage of elephants built a long time ago still retains the grandeur.
Gaint Gate,Rumi Darwaza is very near to Bara Imambara . This beautiful gaint gate is enhancing the beauty of lucknow city. Vehicles passing under this gate frequently and there is no fee.

Rumi Darwaza in Lucknow During summer days at mid afternoon, when sun is top right up. Generally it's very busy lane, just during the Ramzan prayer time seems this place so vacant.LocationLucknow, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHeight18 m (60 ft)Built1784Architectural style(s)Mughal architectureLocation in eastern Uttar Pradesh, IndiaIt is adjacent to the Asafi Imambara in Lucknow and has become a logo for the city of Lucknow.

its the gate through which we can travel,"Made on an unexpected road which is 24x7 open for people to use. This is a piece of architecture that revives the poems of Jalaluddin Rumi.If you've ever read and loved his writings this is the place to visit.Doesn't require any special entry fees or anything its just a beauty standing in the bustling roads of Lucknow.Surrounded by many street food stalls, so you can bite on some nice snacks when around.Overall it's a must visit for any tourist/visitors who finds themselves in Lucknow."

Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Museum,A good place where you can have a glimpse of how Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose used to live in his huge masion.
Take a tonga ride!,"It is simply a door. However, take a 50 bucks worth tonga ride which is totally worth it. The driver will show you the places and be your tour guide as well. Tonga ride is a horse ride."
Beauty of the Architect,It was a nice place Front view and back views gives a architectural expertise. The design of “Nawlakha Haar” and “Chikan“ design taken from the Door only.
Old world charm,Just in front of Bada Imambara is this grand gate called rumi darwaza. One can hire a tonga to experience the royalty of the path that goes from bada imambara to chota imambara through the rumi darwaza. The pebble type wide road here gives a totally different experience.
Flying visit to see this popular gate,"Visited this popular site during a business visit recently, as usual got disappointed with the way we treat our heritage and our tourist attractions! Due to which it is just a grand entrance gate; ofcourse it is magnificent and grand and worth seeing and all, but needs upkeep of area and this monument. In few years time it may be gone at this rate of traffic and abuse."
Nothing but a gate,"When you look at places to see in Lucknow, Rumi Darwaza comes right up there. However, this is just a gate to enter the old city. Best thing is that it is walking distance from Bara Imambara, so won't take more than 7-8 minutes of one's time."
A grand entrance!!,A very large and grand entrance!!Different on both the sides. An impressive architectural structure constructed in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula. The Rumi Darwaza is an example of the fine architectural style of Awadh. The Rumi Darwaza is also known by the name of Turkish Gateway since it is supposed to be identical in design to a similar gateway in ancient Constantinople.The road is cobblestone covered in that entire stretch with parking space. You’ll need to stand on the middle of the road for a good picture.
Charming,Rumi darwaja is very charming darwaza of lucknow. It's design is unique and most beautiful. This place is also very special for photographing. Must visit place for traveller's.
A pass through gate only,Can be viewed from the Bara Imambara entrance. A walking distance of 50 meters only. It is only a gate through which traffic flows through out the day. You cannot go to the top. Has history as it is built in 18th century
Monuments ,It's look look enterence door of Lucknow which is looking so beautiful. It's architectural design attract every one.
Average,"The guide kept on trying to show only one gate from the other side, but the right angle was never reached :) Perhaps a passing by visit during the travel from bada imamwaada to chita imamwaada would suffice."
Gateway,"It's a city gateway. One can see it while driving by. Would make a good photo op, but for the crowds."
Identity of lucknow,Roomi darwaza is a heritage paasage on main road connecting to old lucknow known as hardoi road. Thanks to Akhilesh Govt. to renowating the heritage monuments. Night seen of this gate is magnavision.
Amazing,"I went to Rumi Darwaza. The Rumi Darwaza was built in the 1780s by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. It's unusual but imposing, and said to be a copy of an entrance gate in Istanbul. 'Rumi' (relating to Rome) is the term Muslims applied to Istanbul when it was still Byzantium, the capital of the Eastern Roman empire. It is great place to go."
Symbolic structure,"Sometimes known as the Turkish Gate, as it is said to be identical in design to an ancient gateway in Constantinople. A huge city gate, very ornate, it used to mark the entrance to the City of Lucknow, and is now symbolic of that city. Like other monuments nearby, it was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula to give employment during a famine in 1784.The dome of the roof used to lift up, and the spouts around the archway were designed to spray water out. It was certainly designed to be eye-catching!"
Great gate to have a look,It is one of the best places and if you visit Imambara you get to see this for free as this is on the road and if you cross and go towardsThankurganj you can see Small Imambara and Clock tower as well.
Lovely gate,Not really a stop and walk around type place but interesting architecture.  Well worth stopping for a quick photo
Good place,It is a gate located near bara imamabada. It looks like three gates from inside and one from another side. This is a type of muslim architecture. A good tourist attraction in Lucknow.
Different front view and different rear view,"very good architecture.  Crossed the Darwaza in a tonga and enjoyed the ride.  Also saw the Clock Tower, which was good too!!"
Rumi Darwaza,"It is said to be identical in design to an ancient portal at Constantinople in Turkey and is also referred to as Turkish Gate. It is a huge ornate structure, marked by an eight faceted chhatri in its uppermost part. In earlier times it was used to mark the entrance to the Old Lucknow City. It is now adopted as a symbol of the city of Lucknow. The Rumi Darwaza goes upto a staggering height of 60 feet. The uppermost part of Rumi Darwaza comprises of an octagonal Chatri (Umbrella) carved beautifully that can be accessed by a staircase. The word ""Rumi"" is derived from the modern day Rome that used to be Istanbul, the capital city of Eastern Roman Empire. The Rumi Darwaza is one of the finest gateways that has been built in Lucknow and is highly inspired by a similar gateway in Istanbul.On top of the Rumi Darwaza was kept a huge lantern that would light up the structure at night making it look absolutely fabulous"

Not worth a visit,"It's an ancient gate which has nothing interesting to offer. Not worth making a trip to go see it. In fact I had crossed it before,when going to some other place and didn't give it a look ( as there's nothing to see in it ). When I went to have a look at the Rumi Darwaza , I was like ""what ,we've come to see this ""."

However to take a full shot, one would need aerial view. Worth a visit here."

The gate really needs some maintenance work, a part of it has already fallen and is closed to the visitors. The gate looks different from both the sides. It's difficult to find it quite unless you up early in the morning for some good shots as this gate is an integral part of the city and is constantly flooded with people all the time."
Stand at a Distance and Watch,You will miss the Grandeur if you DO NOT watch it by standing on the road at a distance from the Darwaza.
Majestic,As you pass beneath the huge gateway it cries out loud with all the historical facts and figures who had actually been through the passage. Though it stands guarding the entrance of bara imambara it's sincerely needs attention from geological survey in order to preserve the history it beholds. Impressive work.
Not just a gate!,"This is another wonderful piece of the history of Lucknow. The gate is truly an amazing piece of heritage, with a 3 lane road through the middle. Impressive!"

The beautifully carved flowers and designs speak volumes about the unique architectural style and eye for detail.
Good but not maintained,"This is just beside Imambara but it is not maintained now a days. Also, being on main road it doesn't have proper view. Altough it is one of the attraction to see history of Lucknow"
Rumi the Poet@Lucknow,"Marvellous architecture. Best visited in twilight time. Take a horse carriage tour and visit the nearby small shops, some bargains there."

A good place to visit and see the architecture of the place which is sixty feet tall."
Impressive structure! ,A good photo stop after you come out of the Bara Imambara. Traffic outside is very busy so one has very little time to admire this huge gate. One can still visualise the Nawab and his entourage passing through this gate.
Just a doreway,You can cross this gateway and admire it from both sides. It is a living heritage that is used by people of Lucknow.
good architecture,this is a main gate for entry to the bazar and also to the imambara.the detailing is great but in the chaos it is impossible to stop and see properly .hope the govt can find an alternative route for the traffic so tourists can stop and take a closer look .
"Great architecture, very Lucknow-ish",Rumi Darwaza is an old world Nawabi architecture which just stands in the market on the streets of Lucknow. The Darwaza is constructed in such a way that it has 3 entrances from one end and a single entrance from the other end.  This is located just next tot he Bara imambara.
Rumi Gate,This gate is integrated with Bada imambara. you can reach to the top of this gate. sun set is famous from this place. River bank is very close to it
Good Architecture,u do need someone to actually tell u its significance. Else you will just mistake it to be one of the the other monuments here
A grand Darwaza..  Upcoming place,Rumi Darwaza is quite near to famous Imambara and with construction work going on it can be definitely going to be place to visit and hang on with family and friends..  Upcoming tourist place over next few months
one time visit,"If you are visiting bara Imambara, you can visit Rumo darwaza also since it is 100 m from bara Imambara. Good architectural work."
Western entry point in the city,It's an important monument in Lucknow. I am not a student of history and can not write about it's archeological or history points but can say it as a very good construction of old days.
A lovely gateway,"Runi Darwaza - Rumi is not for the romatic sufi poet from Iran/Turkey, but for a gate which has Roman architecture.It is an elegant gate, abd riding in a Tonga (Ghodagadi) givews some special views."
Iconic spot at lucknow,The carvings are beautiful  but that's about it. Pass under it a couple of times and click a few pictures and that's about it
Must watch in Lucknow ,Visit this place at least once. This place is kind of icon for Lucknow. This place is gate to Imambara in Lucknow.
Gatway of Lucknow,Very attractive built on mougal and Persian style. Minar and Mehrab give the feeling of richness. Great...
Nice Gate and looks very good. Its symbol of Lucknow. Must Watch,"This is a nice and big gate in the road before imambara. Nice architecture work of Navab period and any one can like to see this place. I am recommending to tourists planning to visit Lucknow, must watch this gate."

Big gate good to pass here,this is near to bara imambara. this is a big gate looks very beautiful. symbol of lucknow also used in lucknow metro.
Symbol of lucknow,Rumi darwaza us near imambada. Its design is suite unique. A symbol of lucknow. Give time to appreciate the intricate architecture.
Beautiful,Rumi Darvaza is adjecent to Bara Imambara. It is a historical place of Lucknow. Very Attractive well Designed  Symmetrical Rumi Darwaza
Great piece of ancient architecture,Situated near the imam-bara. Must spend some time to see this. Had seen many gates in various cities but architecture of this is very different.
Magnificent,The Rumi Durwaza ia magnificent monument and must see place in Lucknow. This is a big gate and beautiful from bothe the sides front and back. the arch is so beautiful but the road is too busy so you have to wander it form a distance.
Old City,Magnificent display of Awadhi architecture on a prominent thoroughfare in the old part of the city of Lucknow.
Waste of effort,Not worth  a place to visit. Just see the pic here which is much better than what it actually is-must be of its good old days!!
Superbbb !!!!,"Visited the Rumi Darwaza during my trip to Lucknow, It is so beautiful, that I was truly amazed by it, from backside it looks as if 2- 3 floors, & from front it is 1 whole structure,It is near to many attractions too Bara Imambara, chota imambara, clocktower all are nearby from here, so if you want to visit all of them together you can come here, generally the auto people here take some 40 rs. to show you some 4-5 sculptures here also they will take you to the textile & shop of lucknowi embroidery clothes.One can plan for all the attractions here in one day, if you start in morning & come here.Coming Back Rumi Darwaza is one architectural marvel."
Imposing Gate to Lucknow ,The Rumi Darwaza is near the bada imambara and is an imposing gate. While there was a lot of road work being done when I visited the monument still retains its glory.
Poorly maintained,The whole area in & around is poorly maintained. Does not give a feeling of splendour it once was. Needs a major overhaul.
Gate way to Lucknow,"An archtectural marvel by nawabs of Oudh. Seams to be a single gate way but from the outer side, from Imambara side is a completely different 3 way entry, it must be preserved in good condition."
just a huge door,"just a huge door under which a lot of vehicles pass by everyday. its no architectural marvel, just a huge door made by one of the nawabs"
Excellent Place and a Landmark of Lucknow.,Excellent Place and a Landmark of Lucknow. It is basically a road passing through this Gate (Darwaja) it is the main entrance of BhoolBHulaiya too.
Gorgeous Gate in middle of chaos,It is so beautiful but you cant really get off to see it.Should try early morning I guess. Still would love to see a sound and light show here or at Bada imambara
Between both the Imambara,Best to pass through in a cycle rickshaw. Negotiate for the price as they may ask for exorbitant price.
Architectural Gate,A big gate with architecture engraved on it. Near to Imambara. Nothing very much attractive. Big market.
LUCKNOW ,"Lucknow 's identity is rumi darwaza. If you are visiting Lko and do not visit Rumi Darwaza, your visit is incomplete . It is one of those historical monuments which are associated with the name... Lucknow."

It is adjacent to the Bada Imambara in Lucknow was used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City, but as the City of Nawabs grew and expanded, it was later used as an entrance to a palace which was later demolished by the British insurgents.

A marvelous Darwaza,If you visit old Indian city you can saw many of Darwazas on entrance of many places..But Rumi Darwaza is unique among all of them. This type of archaeological jewel you can find on City of Nawab...Lucknow.
Great bit of history,This is a short stop to make en route Bada Imambara so stop and marvel at this imposing gateway that leads to the city's most famous sight.
