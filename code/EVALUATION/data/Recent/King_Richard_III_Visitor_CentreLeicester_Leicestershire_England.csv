Richard the 3rd,Live in Leicester but had never been to the exhibition before. Really well put together. Very informative. Enjoyed it. Cafe good too.
Great visit,"Excellent facility - informative, well laid out , suitable for disabled and elderly , clean and informative , friendly staff"
"Excellent, shame about timings","We had tickets from Groupon and entered the centre at approx 3.15pm. The lady gave us a map and explained about the centre and the videos being shown etc. In we went...at just before 4pm, we were told they closed in two mins! Apparently they close at 4pm everyday. Fair enough we hadn’t checked, but were not impressed that as we went in this was not mentioned at all; in fact the signs outside said no entrance within an hour of closing, yet we were let in. When we expressed our dismay at having to leave we were told we could come back again for free...oh no wait we can’t as we have group on tickets. So, 45mins before closing and knowing we couldn’t come back we were let in without being advised of closing? If we’d known, we wouldn’t have gone in and come back another day, but now have to pay again. I will note the reason this is so upsetting was we were very much enjoying the visitor centre and had been looking forward to visions for a while, it is an excellent place."
King Richard III,Very interesting visit to a place on our door step of history and how the discovery was brought to fruition.
Very interesting with passionate staff,A very engaging and interesting visit that is easy and approachable to all ages. The staff really made it a great experience as we were able to converse and see the passion for King Richard they had.
Really nice museum,Very nice museum! Interesting  and informative. A lot of activities for children as well! The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Interesting visit,"Well presented exhibition and well worth the visit. Entry fee was reasonable. It didn't take too long to complete, we were there for a couple of hours probably. It was good to be finaly able to 'catch up' with Richard and his trials and see where he was buried originally and found. The story of how he was found is interesting as well and is clearly described. You never really know what's under your feet!"
History brought to life,"Absolutely fascinating What a wonder story, told in an interesting environment Thoroughly enjoyed thisI would highly recommend"
Interesting and Enjoyable,"Well thought out displays ... varied and informative for adults and children. Excellent cafe too. Guides very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable but unobtrusive. Visit finished off nicely by popping into Cathedral to see tomb and enjoy the tranquility. Garden lovely to sit in on sunny day."
Thoroughly Enjoyable & Worthwhile Visit,"I visited the Centre on Tuesday, 10th March and just wanted to say how helpful all the guides and staff were, coming over to have a quiet word to see if I had anything I wanted to ask about the Centre and it's exhibitions. It was a very interesting place, including the chance to see where Richard III's bones were discovered and the story of how they were found. The cafe was also very good value and the staff there were friendly and helpful too.I've intended to come here since the Centre opened and was pleased to finally have the chance to do so. It's well worth a visit and very good value if you get an opportunity to be in the area."
Very Interesting Museum,"We visited on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The museum was very well laid out, with a wealth of information presented in a fascinating way. There were interactive displays and audio visual effects. A very knowledgeable volunteer named John joined us at the grave site and made our visit complete. We would highly recommend the Visitor Centre to anyone with an interest in British history and Monarchs."
An Extremely Interesting Visit to King Richard III - aTrue English King!,"This visit was far above my expectations.  Good introduction to gain the attention of adults and young  alike.   Easy to read exhibits are displayed, together with the description of the search in the car park - amazing!   The place where King Richard was found is there for all to see.   The café was clean and bright, and the staff extremely helpful.   A good display of books, etc. at the entrance to the exhibition.   Then across to the Cathedral to see Richard's final resting place.  A good tribute to him.  Our entrance tickets give us free entry for a year - so we shall be back!"
very interesting,I visited with a small family unit. My grandson had an input to security. We felt at peace with the viewingI do not believe in religion but admire the architecture and calm atmosphere in the cathedral.It was an honour to be able to visit  King Richard 111
Interesting exhibition,Well set out exhibition leading one through events and places and people.  Just the right mixture of visual info combined with information boards to read.The grave site of Richard was staffed by  a lady who answered our questions with great enthusiasm and knowledge. Thank you
Wonderful exhibition,This is a beautifully presented exhibition about a very changeable and often confusing perod of history. The  explanation of the discovery of the King's burial place is riveting.  The guide was helpful and informative.  You then should visit  his tomb  in the lovely  cathedral over the way.  All very moving.
Robert Smith,"Good place to visit. As it was Monday c10. 10 and not long opened, there were few visitors so no problems but good to have booked."
Very interesting visit,As a Leicester City football fan I was very interested in the part that King Richard III played in the securing of the Premier League title in 2015 / 2016 and I was not disappointed.  The balance between the historical story and the science behind the dig and the discovery of King Richard III's body was fascinating.  The alternative view to that portrayed by William Shakespeare was informative and engaging.  The displays relating to the history and science were well thought out and are very inviting.  Food in the cafeteria was also good.  All in all a great day out which was combined with a visit to the Cathedral too.
Interesting ,"A lovely couple of hours out of the rain! Very well done and very informative, with lots to see and read.It did feel like you should have a background knowledge of who Richard was and all about the battle of Bosworth. But then why would you go there if you did not know who he was. I thought the grave site was very well done and was very tasteful and somber. The staff were very friendly and clearly cared about your time there."
Making good sense of history,"Enjoyed the detail in the displays. Particularly strong in the chronological sequence of event and how they were connected. Impressive audio visual near the start. An enjoyable visit, but a pity it’s nearly a tenner each to appreciate this part of our history and the ambitious drive of the few individuals who drove the project forward."
Really interesting,"We've been twice now (great idea that a ticket is valid for a whole year!) and really like it. It's well laid out and really interesting with a variety of different types of interactive displays.  Downstairs you learn all about the War of the Roses, what England was like in the run up to the battle of Bosworth and all about the main characters involved. Upstairs it's about they found Richard III which was interesting too.  And as it's directly across from the cathedral, once you've done the museum and seen the original grave site you can pop across and see the tomb."
Great place and friendly staff,Really interesting place and great history. Staff were all brilliant answered all our questions and smiled! Recommended for a visit.
Richard III: Dynasty to parking lot!,"A great museum with fabulous exhibits.  I truly appreciated the in-depth medical displays and analysis as well.  I had to time seeing some of the rooms displays around a rather rambunctious school group visit, but it all worked out fine in the end."
Visit to see how the story developed ,A brilliant museum and well planned visitor routes. Used high ideas to show the background to the death of Richard and immerse us in the heat of battle.  The story of the dig and the science behind in identifying the remains was brilliant. Our grandchildren remained focused and thoroughly enjoyed it. The visit ended visiting the new tomb again with good explanations.
Cathedral Visit & here as well,"We visit the Cathedral, and while visiting, visited here as well which made the day even more informative."
Well done Leicester ,A must for Richard lll enthusiasts or anyone interested in our fascinating history.Well laid out. Self guided. Good flow from area to area. Interesting plotted history and exhibits.Culminating in the recent history of finding his grave in the buried nave under the car park.Would strongly recommend a visit to the Museum at the Bosworth Battlefield site and the his tomb at Leicester Cathedral as part of your visit.
Very interesting ,"We went with no expectations, it was interesting, informative & fascinating, I don't feel this is good for young children as there is a lot to read."
Interesting but very small,"I’ve been meaning to go to this ever since they found old Dick but haven’t managed until last year. I found the exhibits to be really good, very informative and interactive. It is quite strangely laid out, found myself missing the odd bit and having to go back but I managed to see everything. My only issue was that it’s an extremely small museum, I read everything and looked at all the exhibits and I was there less than an hour. For the quite steep price to get in (every other museum in Leicester being free entry) I found that quite disappointing. Overall worth doing but probably try and find a discount voucher online!"
Good for all ages,We really enjoyed our visit. The amount of information was just right and the interactive parts were fun. The cafe was lovely and all the staff friendly and helpful.
Amazing to see the grave of King Richard III but the centre has too many faults,"It's worth going to the King Richard III visitor centre just to see the haunting grave where the former king was found under a council car park.But the rest of the centre experience didn't quite hang together for me, even though I am a big (non-academic) history lover.The biggest disappointment for me was the Dig Diary section. This was the biggest historical reveal of the 21st century. But it was almost squeezed into a corridor in the centre. Having seen the TV documentary already, maybe I already knew too much. But the diary was rather haphazard and didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. And when you need to use a high-vis jacket and some wellies from the original dig to help bring it alive, you know the material is spread too thinly. It also didn't help that the dig diary story was told from right to left, (when we read from left to right) which just left me feeling a bit too uncomfortable.Overall some of the story telling could be better. And in the end, trying to explain the War of the Roses story but with far too much detail (AKA the cousin's war) ends up watering down the discovery of King Richard's skeleton underneath a car park.My other big moan was was about the suit of armour that Richard III might have worn. It was clearly too big for someone who was a small 5ft 8ins due to his condition. But it was simply ridiculous to have the armour painted white to please the Star Wars stormtrooper generation.Other observations:1) The centre starts with a room called Murder, Mystery and Mayhem, telling the story of the War of the Roses. It was certainly historical mayhem. It was almost as if an academic had puked up lots of historical detail, dates and names without any attempt to tell Richard's story in the context of the war. As one of the guides in the Cathedral commented; ""If you read all the words, you would be ready for Mastermind on Richard III"".2) The throne room is an interesting idea with some video giving insights into Richard's character en route to the throne. But why just 6 seats? And I struggled to hear because of the conversational noise from the adjoining reception.3) The Battle of Bosworth events was really hard to read because of the battle graphics that floated over the words.But it was all worth it just to see the grave, although the inverted pyramid over the grave detracted from the overall experience.I feel really guilty for trolling the centre - my wife's view was the polar opposite of mine.The £9.25 entrance allows you to revisit again over the next 12 months. I intend to revisit to experience the grave again, but also to check that I have called this visit correctly."
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse. ,The location is opposite Leicester Cathedral.  The venue is split over two floors giving a history tour and the excavation of Richard III from under the car park. Access is wheelchair friendly and there is the obligatory gift shop and a small cafe. Cost is reasonable however I was very disappointed that there was no concessions for Armed Force or Veterans.
Impressive Piece of History ,"The Richard III visitor centre is located just over half a mile from Leicester station close to the cathedral.There is plenty of interesting information about the life of the much maligned King Richard III in a series of displays including a video presentation.His role in the Wars of the Roses, his dubious accession to the throne after the death of Edward IV and his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field are well portrayed.However, it is the discovery of his remains under what was Greyfriars Priory in 2013 which is the highlight. The place where his skeleton was found is shown covered in glass and there are several interactive displays relating to the search and discovery of what remained of his body.Very interesting indeed and I paid the concessional rate of £8.30 for admission (full price is £9.25)."
Great exhibition for history lovers and children,"Good for adults and children - with interactive displays. A mixture of the history, the excavation and scientific information about DNA and skeletal findings.  Also I thought reasonably priced - under £10 for an individual, only £23 for a family ticket. I noticed 'under-4s' go free of charge - but I think it would not be suitable for active children under about 8. The ticket can be used for revisiting for up to a year.I visited on a winter weekday when there were not many people. One school party proved unobtrusive. Could be rather congested at peak time."
Great Information,Very informative as you go round with a lot of historical bits as well as an interesting section on how the Kings body was actually found. Not the biggest thing in the world and didn't take too long to get around.
A Gem of a place for Leicester ,Visited three times now - love it. A lot of historical facts to read about and some interactive parts to have a go with make it a really interesting couple of hours.
A tour about how it all happened,"This interactive and detailed tour offers an excellent amount of information for you to understand the history behind the ‘King in the Car Park’. The battles of his time, a timeline of the excavation and the aftermath of the discovery are all laid out clearly and allows you to engage properly with it all right the way through. A personal highlight was the ‘What Happened Next’ area where the fallout is described and emphasises the significance of the find. Well worth the 9.25 GBP entry fee per person."
Took my daughters here,"Great place, full of facts and interactive exhibits. Would thoroughly recommend if you have children who want to know more and curious adults"
A world famous centre just absolutely a must to visit,When I was a student in Leicester King Richard was still under the car park so absolutely fantastic to go to the visitor centre and see where he lay and all the history/tales associated with him.  There are several electronic shows which can be watched and many items to view as well as a gift shop.   You can then walk over to the cathedral and see where King Richard now resides.
Fantastic school trip venue,"We went on a school trip -3 classes on a Tuesday when the centre was closed to the public . From th moment we were greeted from th coach building we left it was super organised , friendly and the most interesting trip I had been on in 20 years . We learnt all about the history of the war of the Roses , we saw the actual grave in the carpark where he was found and each class had a brilliant workshop -  we re enacted the Battle of Bosworth , learnt how to collect dna and had ti decide if he was a good king or bad king . Great day"
Well worth a visit,Wasn't sure what to expect but found the information and exhibitions really interesting. The building is lovely and worth a wander around on it's own. The price is ridiculously good as you can come back for free anytime in the next 12 months!
A Fantastic Historical Experience 🙂,A Lovely building with modern and historic influences. A very well organised display of information throughout. Amazing how many ways they have used to make the information so interactive for all ages. A definite must see any locals and for any tourists.
Very interesting,"I loved this!Lots of information, lots of photos, lots of reading, some videos to watch. A few artifacts and clear explainations of the finding of Richard 3rd. Friendly cafe and clean toilets. After our time here, we walked across the road to the cathedral and saw where Richard 3rd is now in his tomb."
King Richard 111,Well worth a visit. Good value for money. Very interesting spent between 1/12 to 2 hours there. Could have spent longer if you read everything! Everything easily explained and a lot of visual things to see. Would definitely recommend.
The story is true.,Did you hear the story of King Richard 111 being found in a parking lot? Well it's true. See the hole and  learn about his life and death in a well priced and information trip.
Small but very educational,"Very educational museum, with alot to learn, state of the art animation and computer software, so is able to accommodate all ages. Very easy to guide round."
What a story,"The story of the finding of the body of Richard III is incredible and the top floor of the museum is dedicated to those events. You can also see the place in the car park, where the body was found. The first floor relates the history behind the Wars of the Roses and the death of Richard. The whole experience is very well thought out and information is displayed in an interesting manner. There is also an excellent cafe on site."
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING STORY AND EXHIBITION!!!!!,"This is a very well thought out exhibition.  From the find, excavation and whole story of Richard III.  You actually can see where he was found with lighting on the gravesite of how he was positioned. Just a super exhibition.  You must, of course, visit the tomb of Richard III in the Cathedral afterwards.  Just amazing!!!"
Well worth a visit,Good way to educate myself about the Richard III really brought history to life with a modern twist. Well worth a visit.
Interesting visit,"Admission £9 an adult, small coffee shop and visitors shop.Centre well laid out and if you were unaware of history and what happened you would have a good base knowledge at the end of visit."
Greatest Medieval Detective Story Ever!,"I have wanted to visit this place ever since the re-interment of King Richard III's remains in 2015. To my mind the story of the re-discovery of his grave & the identification of his remains (via various methods) is the greatest historic detective story of all time. Tie that in with the fact that Richard III was the last English king to die in battle (in 1485) & that his death marked the end of the Plantagenet dynasty & the Wars of the Roses - & this place is a ""must visit"" for any British history buff.We came here for the day from London: it's just a 1 hour journey by English Midlands Railway from St Pancras International Station in London. As a side note, Leicester was a unexpectedly pleasant place to visit in its own right, having a compact city centre filled with medieval buildings, the Leicester Markets & other places of interest (i.e. there's more to it than just its rugby & football teams). The site of the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard III was defeated in battle by Henry Tudor, is a 30-40 minute drive away (& has its own battlefield heritage centre).We visited the King Richard III Visitor Centre after visiting Leicester Cathedral: I was already familiar with the back story, so the order wasn't important. The Visitor Centre is housed in the extensively modernised & extended former Leicester Grammar School & the entry cost was £9.25 / adult & £4.75 / child.The ground floor presents the background history to the Plantagenet dynasty, the Wars of the Roses, & the rise & fall of Richard III. It does this through a clever combination of video projection & static displays. It also houses the grave site - originally under the choir of the Greyfriars friary - from where Richard III's remains were removed in 2012, to be re-interred in Leicester Cathedral in 2015. We were able to look down through the glass floor to the trench & the grave, into which an image of his skeleton is projected. Opposite the grave, we could also see the medieval floor tiles from the friary.The 1st floor relays the amazing detective story behind the research, archaeological dig, & scientific analysis carried out to confirm that the remains were those of Richard IIIThe guides & the visitor services team members were very engaging & happy to share more of their insights into the unbelievable detective story that was the re-discovery & re-interment of Richard III's remains.Great day trip from London & worth a visit from anywhere."
Fascinating well presented museum,In Leicester city centre next to the Cathedral is this fairly new museum which was set up after the discovery of Richard III's remains under a car park.The first room explains the 'Wars of the Roses' which is a complex period of history to remember and fully understand. Subsequent rooms explain what happened at the Battle of Bosworth and how the skeleton was found and all of the scientific tests and reconstructions that were then done to prove that this was indeed Richard - and to see what he would have looked like.You end up in a room with a glass floor which is built over the burial site. A hologram shows the position that the skeleton was found in. The actual remains are in the cathedral next door.Very informative and friendly knowledgeable staff. Well worth visiting.
Great museum,"I couldn’t believe I was standing over Richard’s grave, a history I loved  studying in high school.  The museum is interesting and does an excellent job setting the stage for this crazy period in British history. He now lies buried right next door, in the cathedral.  A really enjoyable visit."
Appeals at every level and a super place to take visitors,"Living near Leicester we take our visitors here and still enjoy it ourselves after many visits, encouraged by the one year free entry life of a ticket purchase. If you intend to go to Bosworth also, the joint ticket is a good deal saving about £4 on serarate purchaces.One can view the actual grave from the Centre; the interpretive material is excellent. Brilliant AV preentation to start then progress through a wealth of informative display being as selective as you wish. The top floor is mainly about the archaeology, science of identification and facial reconstruction - very interesting stuff.I think a family of three generations would all find something of real interest.If using car, NCP at St Nicholas Circle is near but very expensive; a short distance away on your right with your back to NCP are a couple of cleared factory sites at about £3.If you enjoy Richard 111, consider a trip to Bosworth on the combined ticket"
A must,We travelled to Leicester just to come here and we were not disappointed. This centre has a great lay out with so much to look at and a great variety of staff on hand who are ready to tell you all the inside information. The viewing gallery is a must as well as walking through to the grave site.
Joan Turner,Fabulous day out. So well presented and made very interesting by use of historic artefacts and brilliant cgi shows. Lovely lunch in friendly cafe then up to modern story accompanied by interactive boards and reconstructions.    Add a clipboard and question sheet and the 6 yr old was in heaven    Thoroughly recommend it
Fantastic ,"Came here on a VERY wet Wednesday and spent two hours going round this thoroughly enjoyable exhibition. So much information and the staff/volunteers are so knowledgeable. Didn’t even had to check my watch at all, so interesting. The cafe has a good selection of hot and cold drinks and a good selection of snacks. Also spotlessly clean. The actual tomb is across the street in Leicester Cathedral. Best to visit the Experience first as it explains his life . Also, when purchasing tickets from the Experience, you can go back within the year for free!Brilliant, well done Leicester!"
Excellent ,"Enjoyed our visit, took around 2 to 3 hours depending upon how much you read. The cafe was  also excellent with just the right choices ..cakes, coffee, lunch sandwiches etc. The only criticism l can make is the first part of the displays was too complicated ! With all the Dukes of York etc....over 100 years of history....even though I studied the 100 year war at A levels I felt it could have been simplified...Still a very enjoyable visit and glad we went. Amazing story about the recovery of R remains that was well told. Thank you Leicester."
Nicely Done Exhibition,Really enjoyed the exhibition. We only did the historic part of it not the forensic bit upstairs. Its well laid out and good interaction for kids. Nice cafe and a small gift shop
Really interesting,"Most informative and knowledgeable centre lots to read ( but not to much ) fascinating to learn about his reign , death and discovery of his body. Well with a visit . Down side , not sign posted from the car park the visitors centre recommended. More signs definitely needed"
"Comprehensive information, hands on displays, thought provoking experiences","A very comprehensive and informative visitor centre covering the history of Richard III and the extensive University of Leicester works to discover his remains. Hands on exhibits for all to try and child friendly displays. Much more that an old style ""museum"".Standing on the glass over the actual burial spot brings it all into perspective. How could a King of England finish up here? For me, looking out over the car park reminded me of my early days in Leicester in the 1970's when I parked my car there for two years, not knowing how world famous such a lowly car par would become.All full priced tickets are useable for a year so you can re-visit as often as you like. Do not forget to go across to the Cathedral to see Richard III's actual burial spot"
First visit - very impressed,"Finally made it to the exhibition after seeing the documentary on TV and it was well worth it. Lots to read but the effects were great and the interactive displays were amazing. The staff were helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The café is a perfect half way stop off point too. Will definitely be back in the next 12 months with our return tickets."
Interesting,Good displays. A mix of modern and traditional museum. Fantastic link to our Citys Royal history. Staff knowledgeable and helpful. I've taken numbers of schoolchildren and it's always been a good visit
Great history.,We visited during the school holidays and didn't know if this had made a difference as it wasn't overly busy. Great history and you do need to take your time and soak it all up. The staff were very pleasant and knowledgeable. The place is fairly accessible and spread out nicely. The only bug bear was parking which cost us more than the museum entrance.Recommended for a afternoon away from the rain.
"Amazing Visitor Centre - made even better by ""Sword Master"" Joe","We had a fantastic day at the King Richard III Visitor Centre. The staff were really friendly and the ladies at the front desk incredibly helpful answering all our questions.  It is a really well thought out exhibition and interactive experience both of the history of the Wars of the Roses and the rise and demise of Richard III and of the long journey from conception of the excavation to find Richard III through the fundraising and permissions required and the story of the excavation itself. It was fascinating to see the historical basis of the excavation and the scientific testing that took place. There is also an interesting exhibition presenting the portrayal of Richard III through history and how he has gained his arguably unfair reputation from the image created of him by the Tudors and subsequent representations. Then, of course, there is the view of  the grave itself, now of course empty, protected by glass where you can see exactly where the king was found. The cherry on the top of the cake for this visit was Joe the Sword Master in full costume and with a vast array of weaponry for visitors to handle carefully under supervision. Joe was a wealth of information and an absolute expert on the various weaponry he had and on both the Wars of the Roses and on wider medieval military history and weaponry. We spent a fantastic 20 minutes or so speaking to him and my children were absolutely fascinated with his descriptions, explanations and stories of actual events. He really made the period of history come alive for them. I suggest topping a trip to the visitor centre off with a visit to the beautiful Leicester Cathedral (also known as the Cathedral Church of Saint Martin) just one minute across the courtyard from the centre where Richard III was finally given the royal burial he deserved in 2015. Altogether a fantastic visit and thoroughly recommended trip for any visitor to Leicester or for any history fans."
Cathedral and King Richard III museum.,"Visited in October with our children 4 and 7 as the museum of  the moon was at the Cathedral, the King Richard museum was discounted as we had visited the Cathedral.The museum was really well done and extremely interesting.Considering it was a Saturday it was not particularly busy.Well worth a visit."
Amazing place to visit,"This is a fairly new visitors centre. One of us paid the full adult price, a child and a free carer.It goes through the history of the war of the roses in some detail with the history of the different kings and battles. With a large focus on Richard the 3rd, the site where they found him buried, the process involved in located where he was buried including the process of locating where he was buried and moving the body.Well worth a visit."
stay paly and explore package,visited with my 3 young children. i did look up on their website and read about having art and crafts activities but when i got there it was only a small table with 3 chairs in cafe for children to do that. there was too much writing on walls and my kids were not at all interested only in last room they got to stood on glass floor and did dressing up. overall it is not for young children and was disappointed as wasted one family activity which we did not enjoy and it should not be included on the stay play and explore package
Interesting ,I really enjoyed this as I'm interested in the War of the Roses.  Lots of interactive things & a trail quiz for the kids do they didn't get too bored. Just wish there was nearby parking. Great and friendly staff and a good visit.
The last King of England to die in battle,"So, the body wasn't thrown into the River Soar, but sneakily hidden under a car park!The fake news surrounding Riii is astonishing. But a visit to the centre really gives you reason to question it. Was his reputation deserved? Did he have a stronger claim to the throne than Henry Tudor? It's an astonishing story and the 500 year cold case is even more fascinating.  We loved it!"
Living history,The Richard III visitors centre is located right in the middle of Leicester.The centre sets out to tell the story of King Richard III from childhood to death and resurrection in a modern day car park.Well worth a visit for history buffs who want to learn and see where the king was buried.Expect to spend around an hour. Thennhead across the street to Leicester Cathedral to see where Richard is now interned.
"Visit to Richard III Visitor Centre, Leicester","The whole experience was excellent.  I visited with my husband, our daughter and her son who is autistic.  The experience was well worth the visit.  There was one small disappointment in that an interactive screen allowing facial reconstruction did not work, but this did not really detract from the experience as a whole.  Particularly note worthy was the attitude of two young ladies in Reception who understand that my Grandson who is autistic needed not to go into the first part of the exhibition which was dark, and so they went to the trouble of showing us another way in. We were made aware of being able to visit again.  Excellent throughout.  Cafe very good"
Great exhibits,Really enjoyed visiting the cathedral. Friendly volunteers lovely exhibit. Easy disabled access and lovely garden. Parking is about 5 minute walk away at the high cross is street parking. If disabled you can park on the streets for free
an eye opening way to understand Richard III history,A nice area of Leicester and a worthwhile visit. Great shops and coffee and wine nearby too Keep an eye out for online visit offers.
So full of history,"If our into history, then you will not be dissapointed, there is so much new information and the venue is well laid out and welcomes visitors."
Nice day out made extra interesting by tour guide Ed,I visited on a whim as I was looking for something to fill a couple of hours whilst waiting for a bespoke cake to be finished. I was very interested to see the entire exhibit. The whole experience was really made magical thanks to the brilliantly knowledgable tour guide named Ed he knew many interesting snippets and was really easy to talk to he gave me a few tips for things to do in Leicester too. A credit to the museum if only more museums had an Ed
Local and across the pond,"So this amazing discovery has been in my local town for a good few years now and it took friends from the USA to give the impetus to visit. Wish we had done it earlier. Park at the Shire’s walk through and once there follow the story. Gives a good historic background of Richard and how he became King. Easy to follow through the centre which leads to modern day and how the discovery and dig took place.  I was a-gassed at how they (scientists) have discovered how the King died and what probably caused his wounds. If your young or old, take the visit. One word of caution: the coffee / cafe is a rip off. Very expensive and it doesn’t need to be. But that’s Leicester City Council making money for themselves."
Very interesting ,Very interesting trip. We’ll set out and loads of interesting information. The kids particularly enjoyed getting dressed up as knights
Excellent in all aspects.,We had a group visit and our tour started with a presentation by a very knowledgeable guide using photos to show us the remarkable story of Richard the 3rds discovery in the car park. We then visited the White Boar café where I had a delicious lunch of lamb hotpot.I was really impressed with all the holograms and films describing how Richards life would have been and look forward to visiting again to spend more time in this wonderful experience.
Interesting small exhibition,We enjoyed the visit but there is not a great deal to see so not much time required.Good cafe and shop
Excellent exhibition,I did follow the story as the grave was being uncovered as I have relatives in Leicester. I came to the early exhibition. So it’s good to see all these elements so well combined into a top attraction. Keeping the ticket as it’s good for a year and will be back when I’ve untangled all the Kings and Queens. Good value cafe. Loved the crown insignia on my coffee!
Fantastic exhibition bringing to life one of the most incredible historical stories of all time,"Visited here on Saturday 28th September. I had heard about the story and been fascinated by it for a long time so I was really looking forward to actually visiting the exhibition and the site. The ticket is valid for a years worth of entry which is useful - if I'm ever passing by I will be sure to visit again. The staff are very helpful and willing to answer any queries. There are many historical information boards giving the background to the Wars of the roses and the key participants which serves as a backdrop to Richard's life and ultimate end at the Battle of Bosworth not far away, having been bought back and hurriedly buried in the Grey friars church at this site where he lay for over 510 years. Upstairs you can learn about the archaeology and science behind the discovery. There is a decent café and a sitting area outside. The grave site is very interesting and you can walk over the arachnological dig remains including the site where Richard was found. It is true that he was found right underneath the letter 'R' within the car park.Be sure to visit the Cathedral opposite and the Church of St Mary De Castro if you have time. There are many Richard III information boards dotted around Leicester city centre which are very informative and give all the background to the incredible discovery at this site back in 2012"
Brilliant day out,The staff were friendly and helpful. The exhibition was interesting. The entry tickets last for a year so we will be going back. Also the cafe was great for drinks and snacks
A Good King?,"The exhibits and information were excellent. Staff helpful too Especially good for historians, and boys of all ages"
"A very good presentation of the history of this fascinating man, and the exciting story of hist rediscovery","The ground floor describes the history of the war of the roses - a confusing number of contenders, and a long list of battles. There was a great deal of detail about many things (weapons, battles, the Princes in the Tower story) but it was hard to get a clear sense of the overall flow of events in the war. Then upstairs, there was an excellent history of the rediscovery of Richard's body in the Leicester car park - what a great story! Overall the exhibits were clear and informative. Two suggestions - turn down the volume of the spoken displays - voices boomed out over the whole exhibition area making it hard to concentrate on reading nearby displays - and add a bit more seating in some of the rooms for older visitors like me!"
Great place to visit,This is a really interesting place to visit. The museum is small however the information contain is really well payed out. The video at the beginning of the exhibition gives you some understanding to the background. It takes about 45 minutes. Also the cathedral across the road is worth a visit where King Richard has been laid to rest.
Informative,We visited this site as a group of 4 and really enjoyed it. There is a lot of information to take in over 2 floors (lift available). You can also see the site in the car park where the skeleton of Riii was found. There is a good coffee/snack shop and place to buy souvenirs. Ticket will last for 1 calendar year.
Fantastic Experience,"Great centre which tells the full story about Richard III in myth, literature, history and finally the location and rebuttal of his remains.A very modern and accessible museum with interactive displays, audio, video and exhibits. Cafe is also nice. Big thank you to the great volunteers who really are knowledgeable. Tickets last a year so if I go back to Leicester, I will definitely pop back."
Excellent,"We had seen much about this on the TV as we live in the East Midlands area but didn't get the chance to visit until now.  A most excellent exhibition at the Visitor Centre, BUT ensure you go out of season as it is fairly small and I can imagine the crowds are voluminous in the summer holidays. (I also advise seeing the Centre before going to the Cathedral so you get the chronological picture.)  The process of the actual research and discovery was fascinating.  Unlike some reviewers on this site, I found the history sections to be very relevant and easy to follow; however, my advice would be to read it all thoroughly as then the whole picture comes to light.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. I personally found the 'voice-overs' and sound effects to be too loud and over-rode one another at times, but then I do have sound supra-sensitivity!  A slight comment on the toilets.  It would appear that the locks do not engage at the first turn of the knob; consequently, both the disabled and the ladies' toilets were occupied when I tried to walk into them...embarrassing for both of us in each case!  I suggest a notice reminding occupants to 'turn fully to engage'!"
Fascinating,Very good exhibit and learnt a lot about Richard lll and how he was found.  Definitely worth a visit.
"Top day out, especially with kids - even if history isn't your thing.","I had heard about the centre and was interested in the story of Richard III's rediscovery, got a Groupon to attend with the kids and wasn't expecting much. Was pleasantly surprised by how informative and engaging the exhibits are, going right from Richard's family history and reign to the archaeological and forensic techniques used to find him. At each stage there are interactive/kid-friendly elements which keeps the whole family interested. Volunteers/staff are wonderful, everyone seemed to be chatting to visitors and answering questions. The children were also offered a 'quest' with various questions/activities to complete. They earned a badge for this at the end. There's also a well-stocked craft table in the cafe and a dressing up area at the end of the museum. Parking is limited but its well located in the centre of Leicester, and it's a nice stroll through the city to get there from public transport. Also don't forget to nip to the cathedral after to see Richard III's tomb.We really enjoyed our morning here, you come away with a greater understanding of Plantagenet life and times, but also an appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the historians, following the clues to a car park after 530 years. The centre is a fitting tribute to that achievement, as well as an interesting place to visit."
Good morning out,"Super informative, well presented museum. Really well laid out with a range of different interactive experiences.Also had a live production about ‘out in the field’ surgery during the ages. Suitable for all ages."
Enliving the lost King,"Imagine that you found that you had been parking on top of real King of England all of this time.  Well, under the tarmac, lo and beyond, lies Richarch III, and in 2012 was finally discovered and re-interned in the cathedral. The building next door was purchased and a visitor centre put up, with just the right balance of audio-visual and statoc displays, telling the dual stories, some 500 years apart,  of Richard III, his life and death, and also the story of the discovery of his remains and the development of this new centre.Clearlt Leicester is very very proud of their Richard, and they do everything they can to promote him, positioning him as the last of the medieval kings, prior to the Tudor Henry's who eventually were responsible for the destruction of the abbey and the loss of his remains for all of this period.Well worth a visit, and take the time to absorb the information and the importance of Richard III in the history of the country."
Informative,One of the best visitor centres. Just a stones throw from the cathedral and tomb of Richard lll. Very informative. Well laid out. Lovely cafe. Friendly staff.Fabulous to be able to look through the glass floor to the actual grave where he was found too. Wasn’t expecting that!
It’s an interesting place to visit,The history of Richard III is very interesting and how he was found in the council car park in 2012.
Just passing by,Went to this place by passing by guest. Didnt realised there is so much to see and do. Lots of free stuff as well as paid ones. I only had 25mins to spare but I was very happy with my first visit. I need atleast few hours to explore the place. I think winter time is the best to visit as less crowd and lots to do indoors
Second visit,"This is a great museum. It’s modern exhibits draw you in and educate whilst being interesting/entertaining.It’s not too big so you don’t feel overwhelmed after a time. There is a good mix of historic information as well as plenty about the exploration and dig that uncovered his body.There is good access, a small shop of better quality gifts, not loads of tat like you find in many other places.I didn’t visit the cafe but there is one if you so desire."
"Expensive, but worth it.","In September 2019, entry fee of £9.95 for adult it adds up, but the exhibition is well done and VERY comprehensive. Lots to read if you want to. Helpful staff, good layout, accessible. If one does not know much about the history of that time, you do now!"
Excellent - BUT,"We visited today and from what I could see and read - ONLY ABOUT 1 % - as I am registered blind - this must be a fascinating attraction. I cannot convey exactly how disappointed I was to find that there appeared to be NO CONSIDERATION given to people who have a visual disability, particularly as this is a relatively new attraction. As this is a highly visual exhibition I wonder how overseas visitors will access all the display panels. Particularly as the noise from some of the displays made concentration on what I could see almost impossible. This was also the overall comments made by the sighted people whom I was with. Even if the management of this attraction feel that nothing can be done then at least some warning notice needs to be given on the website to say that visually impaired visitors will struggle to get value for money."
"Informative, interesting and fun",This is a great exhibition. It has everything right. Fascinating story explained so well with live theatrical displays from knights in armour which was an absolute highlight. So helpful and interesting. Well worth visiting and in a lovely part of Leicester near the cathedral and lovely restaurants and shops in The Lanes.
Visit with an elderly relative,"A well presented exhibition about the politics at the time of Richard's life, his life history and how his remains were found and identified."
Buried treasure !,"Visited on a September Sunday morning. Had some trouble finding the place due to a lack of signage. Not quite sure what to expect when we arrived. Pleasantly surprise on the upside. Upstairs exhibit on discovery of Richard III body a little self congratulatory. Knight fighting was fantastic – a little too realistic. Overall, worth a visit. Good value for money."
Great exhibitions about R111 and the story of the dig,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The ground floor is dedicated to the story of RIchard 111 - his place in history and the key events and players in the story. On the first floor is a really excellent exhibition about the dig that resulted in the discovery of his skeleton. Then you can walk through the cafe and see the actual grave site! Friendly staff and nice cafe complete the picture. Highly recommended.
Richard III - A Superb Tribute !!!,"Make no mistake - this is an outstanding Visitor Centre and we had a brilliant afternoon here on Monday !Right from the word ""Go"", it is clear that a tremendous amount of thought has gone into this project, and it shows. From multi-media holograms and plenty of hands on displays, which are so much fun for children, every aspect of Richard's life and times is covered and it was fascinating. Whilst his life was very interesting, it can certainly be difficult to ascertain exactly who was on which side during the Wars of the Roses, but the centre has done an excellent job in trying to unravel the complexities of the different factions and individuals battling for power in England at that time, and the many changes of side which took place.Equally interesting was the search for Richard's remains, their ultimate discovery in the car park in Leicester and the quest to prove that these actually were the remains of the long-deceased monarch. No stone was left unturned and I felt tremendous admiration for everyone involved with the project and very happy that their enthusiasm, diligence and hard work resulted in such a wonderful final result. It is only fitting, in my opinion, that Richard's remains should be finally laid to rest in the impresive tomb in the nearby Leicester Cathedral, a mere 100 yards from the Visitor Centre and which we later walked across to. York were simply being greedy when they tried to claim him - he died in Leicestershire and Leicester is where he has been since 1485 - it is where he belongs.Not only is the Visitir Centre itself a great experience, but the cafeteria was equally good and very reasonably priced, having both an inside sitting area and a very nice courtyard area for sitting outside in the bright sunshine, just yards from the actual gave site in which Richard's remains were found and whioch forms part of the Visitor Centre.I must also add a word of thanks to the very polite young man in the reception area (I asked his name and he told me , but I forgot it - that's old age for you !). He was extremely helpful, clearly knew his subject and it was a delight to chat to him.Your entry ticket lasts for 12 months and as we have relatives in Melton Mowbray, we will definitely be back. I cannot recommend this Visitor Centre highly enough. We parked at the nearby Highcross Shopping Centre and had a pleasant and easy walk through, and although Leicester could not really be descibed as a ""pretty"" city, it doies have some very interesting streets and a fascinating history. Think Richard III, Leicester City, the multi-cultural population, Sue Townsend (author of Adrian Mole), Gary Lineker and Daniel Lambert (England's fattest man in the 18th century) - plus my grandfather was born in the city in 1899 !!! Go on,,,,,,,,,make a visit to the Richard III Visitor Centre..........I dare you. You won't be disappointed !"
Whatever you do visit,"We stopped off en route from London to the Yorkshire Dales to visit having seen the Channel 4 documentary several years ago. They’ve done an outstanding job not just of the visitor centre but of the re-design of the centre of Leicester and the cathedral precinct. Easy to park nearby and, unbelievably, a pleasant walk through the shopping centre to the visitor centre. It was an enthralling experience. Remarkable to see where Richard was buried in 1485 and where he was found more than 500 years later. The cathedral is a 5 minute walk away just across the college precinct. The tomb is dignified,  a proper resting place for a king. This is one of the most remarkable historical discoveries in our history. Leicester has done Richard, and this extraordinary story, justice."
Sunday Family Trip,"It was nice but not very interesting, thought it would be nicer, but for a Sunday trip it’s okay :) the price is a bit too high"
Interesting and informative!,Very informative and well laid out. Not very child friendly as there is a lot of reading and not much interactivity. However they do have a kids trail and the children I saw there seem to be enjoying it. If you want to know all about the REAL Richard III then this is the place!
1st visit for Grandson,"Took our grandson here whilst he was staying with us. He thoroughly enjoyed it as he'd been studying this subject at school so it brought it to life, so to speak, for him. Myself and husband have been a few times and find it fascinating we were pleased to see that the tickets now last a full year as the Space Centre does, we like this deal. If you haven't been you should they've done Richard III proud."
Brilliant Visit,"An excellent insight into the life and death of Richard 111.I suffered from an information overload but it is a few hours well spent, especially with the tomb in the cathedral across the road. Good cafe with reasonable prices."
Interesting ,"The grave site was fascinating and beautiful.  There is a lot of text on the walls and plaques, but my kids were too impatient to let me read it all. Very lovely building."
Excellent ,Visiting this exhibition was the reason for our trip to Leicester and it was certainly worth it. Interesting informative and surprisingly moving.
Very good,The museum gives you an in sight into Richard 111 life and the war of the roses Fascinating models of what he would have looked like I didn’t understand why the replica of his amour was white it looked more like a daft Vader out fitThey were many knowledgeable staff around to talk toThe burial site where he was found is now preserved and covered with glass
Brings history to life. ,"The museum does an excellent job of providing a good background to the life of Richard during the Wars of the Roses, not an easy task given the heavily interlinked families involved and the constantly shifting allegiances. There's plenty to see and do on the history side of the museum and, upstairs, the story of the archeology involved in discovering Richards location and identifying him are fascinating. On top of all of this the staff are incredibly knowledgeable, I could have spent hours talking to Joe about medieval weaponry and battlefield tactics. We'll definitely visit again."
Interesting and enjoyable,"Fascinating exhibit, well put together. Works hard to set the context of the history early on. If there had been an audio tour available for this section, I would have taken it as it gets a bit labyrinthine when trying to explain it all in timelines and dynasties. Very interesting and enjoyable overall."
Excellent,"We only had  just over an hour to visit but would have loved more time. The exhibition is on two floors - the ground floor gives the history of the times and the man; the upper floor is all about tracing his whereabouts, the excavation and the DNA testing. Well worth a visit"
Interesting account of Richard III and the recovery of his bones.,This museum combines an account of Richard III’s contribution with an account of the search for and eventual discovery of his remains. Nice outside cafe area in a courtyard.
Excellent presentation!,"The city of Leicester has done an amazing job taking advantage of the discovery of king Richard’s body. They realized that would be an extremely important if not the city’s most important tourist attraction and they outdid themselves.The visitor center is just opposite the cathedral where Richard’s tomb is located. It presents the history of the battle of Bosworth where Richard III fell in battle, his body’s fate afterwards and how the operation for the discovery of his remains was planned, started and concluded. The whole presentation is great, smart and informative in a clear and understandable way. Also at the center visitors can see and actually walk (because of the glass floor above it) on the grave where Richard’s skeleton was found, this part of the now famous car park is part of the center and they’ve made a separate special room around and above the excavated grave to present the king’s lost grave in a fitting and respectful way.There’s also a very nice gift shop with a great selection of Richard related books among other stuff and a nice restaurant -cafe with an outside space.The Richard III visitor center is a must visit place for anyone who visits Leicester and history buffs!"
Well organised exhibition,I was really impressed by the lay out of this exhibition and the balance between history and archaeology was just right. It was suitable for all age groups and accessible to all. The staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I can't recommend it enough as a complement to visiting Leicester cathedral and the site at Bosworth field.
Fascinating ,Must see Abd the Battlefield. Buy the combo ticket and save. He is actually buried across the street in the church.
Visit to Richard 3 centre,"I went to this place during a visit to Leicester, it is over two floors, the ground floor is about the historical facts surrounding King Richard 3 and the upper floor speaks of the discovery of the King's grave. This is a very interesting place to visit, there is a glass covered area showing the actual grave site. Highly recommended."
History comes alive,"This modern, multimedia presentation of the history of Richard III; The discovery, unearthing and reburial of his remains, and background to eponymous films is a model of its kind.Staff (often volunteers) are in attendance to describe events and answer questions.Tickets provide for repeat visits for a year."
"Lack of content, overpriced","I am resident of Leicester and it has taken me a while to get around to visiting this site. On the whole, I was disappointed. The centre is clean and has interesting video and the information it does have is well presented. There's also a lovely outdoor cafe in the courtyard. Unfortunately, there's just not enough content. Perhaps I had been spoilt by visiting ""The Battle of Bosworth heritage site"" in the county which has everything you could want to know about Richard III, his life, the Battle of Bosworth itself and stacks of archaelogical content and detail. It's also cheaper than this attraction.Particularly disappointing were the archaeological displays on the upper floor. It seemed to be just as (or possibly more) intent on showing the heroics of Philippa Langley and the team than Richard III. Well done to the team, I'd be the first to congratulate them, but do we need an exhibit of her Hunter wellies, a picture of her flogging her book, etc, etc ? Seriously, they have a pair of wellington boots and a hi-vis jacket on display.On the left as you enter the first floor, we find a display which must be at least 5 metres long with photos of famous actors who have played Richard III with some quotes. The point being, how unfair judgement has been on Richard and how we should perhaps be more reliant on impartial historical sources than drama. Fair enough, well said and all that, but the size of the display just underlines the main point about the whole centre. In the absence of content, it's all just so much filler.I think that this centre was put together in haste to cash in on the Richard III connection and not enough thought or care given to detail. It should be £5 for adults and £2 for kids."
Decent,"A well polished museum with friendly staff, however there is not that much for younger kids to do. The tombstone was an interesting feature and the atmosphere was vibrant."
"History’s finest. Richard III Dynasty, Death & Discovery",I was always told he had a bad review. Not this one. Although it seemed to me to be more at a young persons level I found this exhibition fascinating. History & fun together. Leicester have done their King proudThe white boar cafe here is both reasonably priced with a good choice menu & staffed by friendly facesPerhaps I should give Leicester more time to explore. I must say so far I’m enjoying myself
This place is great,"This place is so well done. We absolutely loved it and to be honest thought we would have to drag the 11 year olds round kicking and screaming but they loved it to.  Really interesting how the search came about, how they identified the skeleton and recreated Richard.  However, the best part is standing on the glass floor looking down at the actual gravesite listening to JOHN who is a volunteer but super, super knowledgeable.  Could have listened to him all day."
"Richard III, at last, recognised as a KIng","As our grandson has been at uni in Leicster for the past 4 years it has given me the oportunity to visit this informative Visitor centre several times.As a champion of Richard III  I was pleased to see all the information gathered and displayed about him and his short reign ending all too soon at Bosworth Field. The centre is easy accessible ,well displayed and the information is easily understood. The displays are just great and I would highly recomment a visit to anyone interested in history, followed by a visit to the Catherdral over the road to see the magnicent tomb and stained glass window depicting Richard`s life and death."
King Richard III museum,The first floor details life at the time of King Richard and the second floor the search for his remains by the University of Leicester. I have always been fascinated by this era and found this museum to be one of the best
Very interesting,Quite expensive but nicely done.  The exhibition rooms are very good.  The grave site is very moving.  Must see the grave in Leicester Cathedral as well.
Excellent,"Modern, well thought out, interesting place. Interactive, lots of things to do with a range of styles of presenting the information about KR3 and the discovery of his remains. Well worth a visit and an hour or two of anyone’s time. We visited On a Sunday so parked in the City Centre for free. Mid week might need more attention to where to park."
Very interesting!,Tells the story of the Wars of the Roses from the beginning with family trees and details of all the battles. It then tells the story of Richard and the  recovery of his remains using interactive displays and interviews. We found it all very well laid out and totally absorbing . The staff were very friendly and there is a nice cafe.
Very Interesting,Highly recommend. Fascinating to find out how the remains were discovered. Doesn't take too long to visit. Very central for visiting the rest of Leicester town centre
History being portrayed well,Good quality displays telling the story of how Richard III ended up buried in a Council car park and how he was found. A fascinating tale.
Fascinating,"Even if you know very little about the history of Richard lll you will still find the information on finding his grave fascinating. The early part of the museum outlines this period of history and depicts a Royal family tree of the era. This then links to some info on The Princes in the Tower and The Battle of Bosworth, through to his death. There is a lot of information in this section which may be over the heads of a lot of visitors. Upstairs you learn about the amazing discovery of his grave, achieved by a committed group of people who put a lot of work into reaching this goal. It is absolutely worth being on site to see the enormity of this achievement. Be aware that the visitor centres closes at 4pm. I arrived at 2:30pm and I was literally the last to leave, wishing I had more time, so allow at least 2 hours, more if you are a Richard lll history buff. Saying that, I had a very quiet experience with only a handful of fellow visitors around. Don't forget to pop into the cathedral next door to see his final resting place. The guides there are keen to chat and will give you plenty more history too."
Covers all the bases,Covers history and the scientific extremely well.   Volunteer staff greatly improved experience with one-on-one description and info.
Overpriced Tourist Trap,"This is really just a shameful expensive money making exhibition based around the "" Richard the Third business model"". Unless you are avidly interested in the subject I'd suggest that you give this a miss and save your money. Your children (should you take them) will probably be bored to tears.Completely unmemorable.Each to their own of course and a representative from their publicity department will be along shortly to tell you that - but of course someone has to pay their salary."
History made accessible,"Okay, it helps if you are interested in the history of Kings and Queens (but mainly Kings) of England, but the intrigue behind RIII's rise to power remains a powerful mystery.  Add to that the amazing discovery of his place of burial, a fascinating story on it's own and this is a really good 3-4hrs, including coffee break and lunch (baked potato if you're gluten free!).There's a lot to read and young minds might be overawed so best introduce them to the story (age appropriate) before you go. If you never saw the C4 programme Looking For Richard then this delivers a brief précis: press the buttons to listen to the talking heads interviews,  only minutes long, but you come to realise finding Richard wasnt short of 'Divine Providence'. Park in High Cross rooftop car park, 5 mins walk through the shops and see what to buy on way back!Two small complaints: nowhere does it tell you, you can get 241 entry if you show an English Heritage membership card, we inadvertently overheard the desk staff; Might be worth going to the Cathedral first to see the grave. We checked the cathedral website, checked it was open, no events, but they didnt tell the Visitor Centre it was closing at 3pm for a wedding, which was late (someone got cold feet?), And the visitor centre didnt have the means to warn visitors."
Informative and well laid out ,"On entering the centre, we were greeted by the pleasant staff on the desk, who provided us with helpful information. There is an easy flow to the museum to ensure you see everything, and their use of audiovisual displays is excellent. Of particular interest is the upstairs gallery focusing on the archeological digs and the DNA analysis used. We also had lunch in the cafe in the centre - lovely local produce at an excellent price. The other thing to note is that you can visit for a year with your ticket, which is a huge benefit.The volunteers based around the centre are also well-informed and again very pleasant, happy to provide further information. Overall it is very informative and interesting, absolutely worth the entry fee!"
"Good, slight audio visual overload","This venue is built on the actual place where the body of Richard the 3rd was found, and presents his story with multi media. Others have commented that there are so many tapes playing at the same time, that it is hard to know what to listen first. We also had a large group of noisy students stomping through, not sure what they got out of it! We enjoyed it on the whole, the story of the princes in the tower was touched upon, Bosworth and the pivotal role the Stanleys played, and finally the story of the dig. We saw a copy of the skeleton and a facial reconstruction on the skull, showing that known portraits of him are fairly accurate. Small garden and nice coffee shop,modest giftshop"
Great  visit.,Enjoyed our visit to the Richard lll visitor centre. Plenty to see and lots to learn. I was interested in what these clever people could tell from a load of old bones about how Richard had died and which wounds were inflicted after death. The guide was very knowledgable. We will visit again.
Excellent and very informative,"Well worth a visit whether you're a confirmed Wars of the Roses addict or just looking for something of historical interest. The story behind the finding of Richard's grave is fascinating and there's some serious forensic science involved with finding his last-in-line modern relatives through DNA tracing. The highlight of course, is Richard's hastily prepared grave. I'd recommend that you combine this with a visit to the visitor centre at Bosworth for the complete Richard III experience"
So Interesting,"I am such a RIII fan and I have waited years to visit this attraction and I wasn't disappointed.The only thing I would comment on is the noise level, I don't usually have any concentration problems but I did find that when more than one voice led information screen was playing it was difficult to concentrate on the one I was watching, if that were coupled with lots of visitors talking I could imagine it would be a problem. The other thing I would comment on is the room where Bosworth Battle is being depicted, it's almost impossible to read the information on the walls because of the flashing images, my daughter, who is a Mental Health Nurse commented that if I had any problem which was exacerbated by flashing lights it could have been a real problem."
Definitely worth a visit,My Canadian friends were interested to find out more about English history and thoroughly enjoyed their visit so we followed it up with a visit to Bosworth Heritage Centre.
EXCELLENT INFORMATIVE EXHIBITION,We had Groupon vouchers for our visit so got a cheaper rate whilst in Leicester. At the outset I have to say anyone wishing to give this exhibition its true worth needs to set aside plenty of time to soak in all the information both written and interactive. We both loved every moment of it and what a fitting historical tail and rediscovery of the body of the last true King of England. Whilst there we also visited the onsite cafe and purchased both food and drink. There was no shortage in the food department and the prices are quite reasonable. Anyone interested in the story of Richard 111 and the discovery of his body should not miss this exhibition. Also visit  the Cathedral across the road and see where he is entombed.
Where history was discovered.,We have wanted to visit this attraction ever since the body of Richard 111 was discovered in Leicester.A lot of fair and impartial information about the war of the roses and the discovery of his body.A visit is highly recomended.
Informative,"Enjoyable visit. Well written information,saw where Richard was buried in the car park! Interesting to see the facsimile of his skeleton and his spine and war wounds."
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"If you are in Leicester, you must visit King Richard III. This fascinating story of medieval power struggles and modern archaeological discovery is well worth a visit. I would allow about an hour for the visitor center, and another hour to check out the nearby sites, including the cathedral where the King is now buried, and the Guildhall. The visitor center is modern and well designed, with the story of King Richard's life and times on the ground floor, and the story of his recent rediscovery and archaeological analysis on the upper floor. Highly recommend if you're in Leicester!"
Fascinating and reverent museum to the Yorkist King,"Wonderful modern museum takes you through the fascinating life of this short-reigned monarch. The lighting, the decor and the exhibits bring the history of his time and the search for his body to life. I feel the museum would benefit from a scale model of the battle as his death was the tipping point in the Wars of the Roses where battles had punctuated the last thirty years up to his death."
OK if you dont know too much about Richard,"The title says it all really.We were on a road trip from Spain and had been looking forward to visiting this exhibition for a while. We found parking to be difficult,especially as one of us had mobility problems. We did'nt learn anything new from the experience. The staff were most helpful in providing a wheelchair. The 'Cathedral' is only a short walk away, but is not an inspiring resting place for a King of England."
Died in 1485 and found in 2012 - a fascinating slice of English history!,The story of how the remains of King Richard III - the last English king to die in battle - were discovered under a Leicester car park in 2012 is truly fascinating. See the place where he was found and learn from a vivid and very interesting multi-media display in the surrounding visitor's centre.  Make sure you also see King Richard's tomb where he was laid to rest in 2015 in the adjoining Leicester Cathedral.
Was interesting,Visited with colleagues for our team building event. Had never visited before and heard mixed reviews. We found it interesting and lots to read and fair bit to see. Liked the sculptures too. The video at the beginning could have been more interesting/interactive.Would recommend to someone visiting Leicester and wanting to know more about King Richard the third. A shame the site or company does not accept Amex cards!
Definitely worth a visit,We had some American friends staying and wanted to show them local sites and history.  We visited the Centre which has been done really well and with lots of information to read and view.It is an incredible story of how King Richard III was discovered and good to see the shallow grave where he was found.A good gift shop to buy a few items too.
A Great Way to Learn about Richard III in Conjuntion with Leicester Cathederal,"I made a solo visit, as I wanted to immerse myself in the history and the various differing viewpoints about one of England's more famous/infamous kings. The Centre is very well laid out and presented and each room has an interesting tale to tell about Richard's life, the Wars of the Roses, his rise to power and dramatic death at Bosworth. The detective story, as to how his remains were refound after 500 years, matches some of the intrigues that surrounded his life, is also very well presented.The food and drinks at the on site White Boar café are of good quality & the range of souvenirs for sale at the entrance are great - thus I was able to buy mock chain male armour plus Richard III pencil & rubbers & mugs to take back for my 8 year old sons who are now enjoying them (hopefully, when they are older they may want to visit the Centre too).Richard's simplistic but grand new grave is literally over the way in Leicester Cathederal and is a main attraction there (free entry, but donations welcome)."
Worth a  Visit.,"We found this museum very well set out, first of all with it's reminding us of the history of the wars during this period. Good interesting pieces to read and or listen too. Richard's original grave is also on show beneath glass. The story of the tracking down and finding of Richard's grave on the upper floor is absolutely fascinating ... There is also a large café with a courtyard on site."
Richard III - not too much!,"We spent 2 hours here which was plenty. Almost too much information regarding the history, if like me you forgot most of what you were taught at school, but the videos helped! Upstairs the information on the archeological dig was amazing and I got caught up in the excitement of the unfolding picture. Seeing the grave was surprisingly moving. A great visit which was worth the entrance fee."
History made interesting!,"A wonderfully informative half day excursion, a combination of history of Richard 3, the family tree, interactive questions and an excellent exhibition of the journey of discovery. Great cafe too with tasty offerings!"
Interesting ,"Visitor centre is well done with lots of fantastic information. Detailed explanation of the war of the roses and then how they proved the body they found was Richards. Lots to do if you have children! The ‘medieval doctor’ was fascinating, and a bit gory! Lovely cafe with great food on site."
A great history lesson,"We took out 5 year old as she wanted to go to a museum and we have never been. It's a very well made space and some of the exhibits are brilliant! Seeing the recreation of King Richard's face was lovely and sad to see the replica of his skeleton, with all its wounds and feet missing! It's a shame it's not a little more child friendly, our little one can read, but the text was just too much for her. A good visit."
Not to be missed if you are visiting Leicester,"Although this was first visit it will definitely not be my last. The visitors centre displays a wealth of information about Richard III, the blood line & all associated aspects. You view the grave from a glass floor a few feet above, it is superbly preserved with a hologram showing exactly where the skeleton was positioned when it was found.I visited mid afternoon on a weekday and was treated to a 1 to 1 talk by one of the volunteer archaeologist guides which was truly fascinating - full of fact & history"
Incredible,"This was our main reason for visiting Leicester and did not disappoint. The staff on the front desk were very friendly, dealing with our English Heritage discount with no problems.Once we moved into the centre proper, we were greeted with a video introducing the main players in the tale. This lower floor details the family history of Richard and the path to his untimely death on Bosworth Field. Once you move upstairs the discovery of his body and the science involved in identifying him is revealed but in a way that everyone can understand. There are some great interactive bits and bobs up there and the reconstructed head is both amazing and slightly spooky.From there, enter the grave site. It’s in a modern addition to the centre and provides an oasis of calm in which to contemplate.The volunteer, Lynne, who was working in there at the time of our visit was really very good. A great depth of knowledge and she delivered it in a friendly way.The cafe is a great spot to review your day and the cakes are really good.Just make sure that you allow yourself enough time to absorb everything this place has to offer."
Outstanding visit,"Our party of 36 friends and family visited the Richard 111 centre and had a guided tour by the manager.  Having a guide really made a difference, he was very informative and capably answere all the difficult questions we asked him.  He also managed to do it in the short timescale we gave him.  Highly recommended"
History lovers discovery,Really interesting to follow the work that went into the discovery of Richard lll burial place.  Leicester cathedral has done a magnificent job of looking after him. Pay particular attention to the wonderful stone tomb with its special significance!
Wonderful place to visit.,"Fantastic place to visit, see all the history of Richard the 3rd, do not miss his tomb at Leicester Cathedral a few yards away."
Really interesting visit,This is a great place to visit but there is A LOT of written information and I confess we found the timelines and family histories somewhat confusing. However the exhibits were superb and the story of Richard's discovery fascinating. The reception guide was extremely knowledgable and filled in a lot of gaps for us. Great also to go over to the cathedral and see the resting place.
Over busy at the start,"Quite interesting but way too much to read! It was interesting from the forensic point of view and to be able to see the actual burial site, but I wouldn't go again."
Fascinating and great cafe!,"Visited here today with my Dad and 4 month old daughter. I rang ahead to check the facilities, but it is fine to go round with a pram and they do have baby changing facilities.The centre is presented really well, with sections focussing on the War of the Roses and background of Richard III, the battle itself and of course the discovery of the remains, how they were identified and what they tell us about how Richard died. With projections and videos as well as plenty to read, you could spend a long time here.The gravesite is also nicely presented, but unfortunately the projection of the remains wasn't working, without this seemed a bit sparse.Really impressed with the cafe as well. A good selection of food and much more homemade than many attraction cafes. The coronation chicken panini was really tasty.Also got to mention that the staff were very friendly and informative.My only negative is the poorly designed baby changing room. Far too small so I had to park the pram just outside it, partially blocking the door to the ladies toilets. There was nowhere to put my changing bag in the room, so had to grapple with baby, nappy, wipes etc before I went in. But also because the room was so small, the pull out changing surface is directly above the toilet. Should your baby manage to wriggle off the surface (and I imagine it is possible once baby is rolling as it is quite narrow, even if you're carefully monitoring!), your baby would fall into the toilet. Also seems a bit unhygienic to be so close! Finally, if you're on your own with baby, there is no way you could go to the toilet yourself. Disappointing that this hasn't been though about."
Informative history of King Richard,The centre has well written information of how King Richard was found etc. and gives a good incite to his reign as King.  The entrance fee is a bit steep at £9. There is a cafe and gift shop to entice you to spend more!
Absolutely Fascinating!,"I went with a group of 27 visitors. We were lucky enough to have an excellent guide provided by the Centre. He made the whole historical background to Richard clear and interesting. We then viewed the history of the excavation. Having found his skeleton, the Centre explains his physical build and the wounds that were found on the body and finally finishing at the grave site that was found in the car park. The Centre also has an excellent cafe."
EXCELLENT VISITOR CENTRE,"We enjoyed our visit here.Well laid out exhibition. Lots of interesting information on the discovery of the grave, very well documented. Amazing how modern technology has helped with this project and the determination and perseverance of the team working hard to achieve this. Unexpected bonus seeing the actual  'car park site' through the glass floor, the guide there giving us a lot of detail about the site. Something of interest here for all ages. A well stocked gift shop with good guides and books available.Well worth a visit, we also went on to the cathedral to see the tomb."
came across by chance!,"We were dropped off from a coach tour, given maps and decided to head to the cathedral where a very nice gentleman pointed us in the direction the this attraction, and what great advice it turned out to be.excellent exhibition, and for two Scots who knew very little of the war of the Roses very enlightening.    well worth the entrance cost!"
Free return visit ,"Really interesting place to visit, made better by the ability to revisit within 12 months for free.If I had one criticism it would be that some of the exhibition is too wordy and takes too long to read which spoils the flow when the centre is busy and people read at different speeds."
Very interesting,"Very well laid out and thought-through exhibition run by enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff. An unexpected bonus was being able to stand over the actual excavated 'grave in a car park'"
Great day out,"Very interesting and informative Museum. It isn't just about Richard III, you get to learn about the rise and fall of the Tudors and the Civil War. Downstairs is the historical aspect, upstairs you follow the story regarding the discovery of Richard's resting place. After visiting, pop across the road to the Cathedral to see Richard's tomb.A great day out, highly recommended."
Amazing ,"Excellent exhibition and must see ! Very well presented with clever exhibits which includes a mock scanning machine of Richards bones. Fascinating. The story of Richard third is a convoluted tale and takes a bit Of digesting but the exhibition nails it and gives a clear account of ,’ who is who’.A fantastic must see."
Who wants to see a whole in the ground !!!!,"Really disappointed with the place.Overhyped, more about how his bones were dug up than the history of the man.Glass floor over a hole in the ground - wow!!! really exciting (NOT)Not much else to say really."
Day out,Recommend this to anyone visiting Leicester.Excellent centre and very well presented with great exhibits
A fitting memorial for one of our Kings,"We visited after going to the Bosworth Battlefield site.  There are impressive displays at this Visitor Centre, the most interesting of which were those about how they worked out where to dig - partly a good guess or was it sensed in some mysterious way?  And also the other work to prove that this would be the right location in relation to other buildings that were on the site.  And the DNA and other tests they ran to prove who he was, incidentally finding out that he did indeed have a back problem.  As for Richard himself, on being told he was found under a car park, he might ask what that was and would be surprised to find we could regularly go about the countryside at 70mph or more!  He might consider that much of the work to find him and prove it was him would be incomprehensible sorcery no doubt.  It was also good to find that he was not quite as bad as painted by Shakespeare.  His original grave itself is sad in its simplicity and scarcely fit for anyone, but it is fully countered by his rightful new tomb in the cathedral, across the road.  Good cafe for lunch too!"
A special slice of history,"This wasn't our first trip, in fact it was about our 3rd, but as your ticket gives you access for a year and  there was a Lego event on we thought we would pop along. I had forgotten what a great exhibition it is, so we didn't rush round as planned we revisited it all again.My favourite part is the first floor, it just puts into perspective how amazing the discovery was, I especially like the timeline wall with photos. The fact that lightening struck as you found the bones (and pics to.prove this), and in general how the puzzle was solved was amazing.My 11yr old loves the interactive skeleton where you find out about the wounds he sustained and the reconstruction of his face. I think he feels there is a lot of reading in the exhibition, but that's not his favourite past time! The language is easy and interesting enough for tween and teenagers to take a lot away from all.the info boards.For Easter weekend there was a Lego event recreating his coat of arms from Lego. It was a bit like paint by numbers, and fun for us both to do.I really recommend taking the time to visit, it's amazing how modern technology, research and luck helped find a lost King of England; it's also in a lovely part of the city with many cafés, bars and restaurants nearby."
Fascinating,"In Leicester with my teenage son for other reasons and had some spare time so decided to visit. Not large, but lots of information, well presented and definitely worth a visit. My son isn’t a history buff like me, but it held his attention. The guide that spoke to us near the actual grave of the king was also well informed. I bought the book ‘The search for Richard III’ in the gift shop and having now read it the story of the excavation, set vs. the historical background, is an incredible story and the visitor centre does it justice."
Compact and fascinating museum,"We visited with grandparents and children (9 & 11). There's lots of information (a bit too much on places), so it took time to take it all in. The video at the start is very well done. The grave site is suitably sombre with gravitas. Lovely courtyard by the cafe. Our daughters loved the dressing up, the (temporary) Lego activity and the gift shop. Amazing story retold very well. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly. We popped over to see the new burial in the cathedral afterwards. There's a discount with English Heritage membership. Closes 5pm on weekends and bank holidays. Two hours was about enough time."
"New, claean and developing","It's only seven years since the old king was found under a car-park, and since then the museum next to the site has developed into a fascinating history and science exploration. Several rooms of detail on Richard's family history and life, wih other rooms exploring the findings developed from the body itself, wounds, DNA etc. Finally the site of the discovery itself. Helpful staff, nice cafe. Not over-cheap."
King Richard 111,Very interesting place to visit. So much information to look at and read. Absolutely fascinating. Need to go again as ran out of time to read everything. A great place to learn about Leicester’s king.
"Very interesting museum, especially the upstairs","An interesting museum. I found the upstairs which was about the dig better than the downstairs which was about the historical background. I found the displays downstairs quite complicated, including a very detailed royal family tree which left me a bit confused. It was nice to see the place where the skeleton of the king was found, and to be able to go just across the road to the cathedral to see where he was re-buried.There's a good tea room, and a nice courtyard to sit in, too."
"Good, but needs more of a wow factor","This is essentially a museum dedicated to the discovery and identification of the lost body of Richard III, as such it's got potentially narrow appeal.The building and facilities are excellent and the upstairs display of the science behind the skeleton's identification, wounds received, armour he likely wore and Richard III in Shakespeare is well done and logical.  I thought the ground floor less so as it deals with the background of the Wars of the Roses and battle of Bosworth by charging straight in with a load of detail, without explaining the big picture.  The history and relationship between the protagonists is very confusing for anyone but a historian and needs better treatment than the rather naff over-acted film played in the throne room as you enter. My advice would be ditch the current show and replace it with a straightforward short documentary giving the facts and background to Richard's life and death, so non specialists can understand the rest of the museum.Worth a detour, but not a special trip, unless Richard III and his mystique is your thing."
A bit sparce on content,Interesting to visit for obvious reason but a little disappointing on content.   Leicester could have made more of this historic find.
Excellent presentation,"Visited this centre on Monday, 15th April.  Absolutely brilliant!  I'm no history buff but it was interesting and very well presented.  Loads of information and visual presentation.  Would really recommend it.  Possibly not for very children but anyone over the age of about 10 would be able to understand most of it."
Exceptional Visitor Centre,"Having heard all about King Richard and the find in the car park , we decided to book for our weekend away in Leicester.I graduated from Leicester university with my MSc a few months before the discovery, so I watched it all closely.From the minute we walked into the visitor centre we were mesmerised.Absolutely fantastic from start to finish.Very informative, well set out. Excellent relevant displays.The staff were lovely and we had a good chat to the volunteer.Seeing the actual grave where he was buried felt strangely moving.We enjoyed a really tasty lunch in the cafe.We set out afterwards on a walk to see Bow bridge.Also bought the book written about the discovery of his body.100% recommend a visit to the King Richard lll visitor centre."
Excellent Visitor Attraction,The centre is well laid out with plenty of information both historical and details on the dig. The excavation has been well preserved and displayed very well.
Really terrible! ,"There's no linear explanation of... Anything. Just a load on information shoved in your face with out any explanation about how it relates to Richard. No linear flow, just random bits of information sometimes every missing crucial parts that you have to try and deduce what happened. It's more an ""interactive experience"" than any sort of logical display. The ""archaeology"" upstairs is even worse. It's basically a display version of the Channel 4 ""king in the car park"" documentary, with more of a focus on that hysterical Langley woman than the archaeology or king .The grave site was also disappointing. A glass floor over the excavation site with a few volunteers to answer questions. There's a light projected to show the outline of the remains, but that's it. No displays, no information about what we were looking at. Nothing. Not worth the money imho."
Really interesting history,Visited this place. The history around King Richard was really interesting.  Once you buy your ticket you can use it again in the same week if you need to re-visit  the place.  Well worth going to see it.  Would suggest 1 1/2 - 2 hrs.
Disappointing ,"Things started badly as the signage to the venue was very poor and finding a car park was very difficult.There really is very little content, goodness knows how you could pans one to two hours there?The actually site where the bones were found is a little interesting, as is the skeleton, showing his injuries, but the rest is largely interpretation boards with content you could view online."
Excellent!,What a fascinating mine of information ! We enjoyed the excavation story more than the history bit but that is just us! Very well set out and great for disabled visitors.Tip - research local disabled parking! Good cafe.
Tickets valid for one year,"Situated across the road from Leicester Cathedral lies the visitor centre. Having watched the burial of King Richard in Leicester Cathedral on tv some years ago we recently spent a weekend in Leicester to visit all the relevant sites.We decided to use the park and ride facility as there is no car park close to this venue. After paying our admission (don’t forget you can purchase a combined ticket with the Bosworth Battlefield site) we entered into the Throne room where a number of realistic characters appeared on the wall opposite to tell their tale. There are a small number of chairs to sit on. After this you enter a room giving Richard as the King and some AV presentations. This concludes with the Battle of Bosworth and Richards death.There is a lift or stairs up to the detective and research area to find the resting place of the King. If you have time the scientific analysis carried out on the remains makes an interesting read.Downstairs the Blue Boar cafe serves hot food, sandwiches, hot/cold drinks, pastries and cake and also a children’s selection. The area on our visit was spotlessly clean and staff more than helpful. A door leads out into a courtyard where there is more seating, ideal on a warm summers day. Opposite the cafe is a door,leading inside again and this is where the grave site is. Very cleverly they have illuminated where the bones lay undisturbed for over 500 years before being found underneath the car park. When the sun shone on this area the illumination became more intense. We thought it was a great use of space and there is an area with dressing up costumes for children and grown ups to try on before entering back into the gift shop and admissions area.Perhaps you may have a different view on Richard III after your visit here?"
Interesting museum but...........,Very good small and interesting museum however trying to find it was another matter.Signage on the roads was very poor. We drove round the area for 30 minutes before finding our way in.
The complete Richard III Experience,"My daughter and I visited this museum with half-hearted expectation.  However, it offered amazing insights into Richard III's life, The Battle of Bosworth Field and the very moving and emotional site of Richard's hasty burial - in the car park.  Please if you can, visit this museum - the staff were very well informed and helpful - our only slight snigger was the high-viz jacket and wellingtons on display which belonged to the chap who actually found the skeleton!!  Hardly history in the making but made us chuckle!"
The best,Probably the best visitor centre we have ever visited. The church where Kind Richard is buried is opposite and the centre then provides the story and the explanation of who King Richards skeleton was found. The displays were superb and so well arranged. The only niggle and it is nothing to do with the content of  a brilliant centre- the restaurant could do with slightly better signage for queuing and more staff - a long time to get a cup of tea!!
Wow! What an experience.,"We took my parents and our 2 children to visit here and it's fantastic. Educationally it's second to none. Schools don't do this kind of history now, it's a must for those wanting to learn (or reacquaint themselves) about the history of our great nation. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff, a great café/restaurant. I can't recommend the museum highly enough."
Excellect place,Brilliant place.  My 8 year old loves going time after time.  Never gets bored.  Loads to see and to interact with and sometimes in the holidays children can get to make things or they have special little shows put on.  Good value for money.
So much history,"A really informative, interesting visit. Loads of information. Amazing to believe you can see part of the carpark through a glass floor section where Richard's remains were found. Had a visit to Leicester Cathedral to see where he is buried."
Bit disappointed ,"The centre was recommended to me. I asked the desk clerk how long it would take to walk round, and was told about 1.5h, but I was struggling to find more things to look at, after 20 minutes. It has a spacious reception/ gift shop. There are a number of displays, but all require a lot of reading. There were 2 floors. One contained a CSI style mock-up of the facial reconstruction of the skeleton found. All in all, this place was interesting and directly opposite the Cathedral, but was really very small & took such a brief amount of time to walk round that I couldn't justify the £9 entry fee."
Discovery,The story of the finding of the King's remains in the car park were fascinating.  The display about the Wars of the Roses was a little difficult to follow.
A must for R111 enthusiasts and history junkies,On entering the R111 experience your tranfered back in time by a visual show and commentary which outlines the historical context. You then travel through the exbo into a themed show of both fixed and moving stories into the past of Richard. There are two floors of interesting things to see plus a shop and cafe. Nearby is the Cathedral where Richards body is buried and a statue of him also restaurant and the medival town hall which is open to the public. All in all a well worth visit to this historic city.
Really fascinating and informative ,I do not know my history as well as I should so reading all about the kings of England in this visitor center was interesting.  I really gained an appreciation for why Richard III was vilified.  It was also interesting looking at how they discovered his grave.  It’s not a huge center but you could spend an hour or two reading the displays.  It was fun to visit. I’m not sure how younger kids would do here.
History at it's best,"Fantastic opportunity to hear and learn about King Richard and his final resting place. Saying too much here can spoil the treat. Accessible to all. Toilets and shop facilities. Good selection of books and items to purchase. Friendly and very helpful staff. Reasonably priced for the time it takes, ticket is valid for a year so you can return."
Richard 3rd Museum. A Must see..,One of the best things we did in Leicester on a recent visit. Very interesting place. Staff were excellent and very friendly.. Well worth the entrance fee!
An Absorbing Historical Exhibition,"We visited in a group last autumn and had a most interesting talk before our walk round the exhibition. There is so much to see and read, and try to remember, that we returned in Early March to have another visit to view the parts we didn't have time to see previously. It's all so well presented.  An enjoyable day and well recommended.Only grouse......we had friends who wanted a coffee with us in the cafe.......you cannot access (the cafe) if you do not pay to see the exhibition. They had to leave us and go elsewhere."
Unmissable Museum.,We visited the museum and were stunned by the presentation of the facts. It starts with a film of actors depicting their historic roles in the story of Richard. It is followed by a room full of pictures and we'll presented facts. Another room shows the re-enact ment of the Battle of Bosworth. Further upstairs rooms show how the body was discovered and identified. Finally a glass floor shows the place where the body was discovered. The building is airy and well designed.
"Excellent representation of Richard III, both history & discovery","The museum has used various styles to present a complex set of events, characters and intrigue in an informative and logical  way.  Not only have they covered the history of Richard III but have also incorporated the huge effort in discovering & excavating his remains and used modern technology, such as the hologram of his position in the grave, to present it in a fascinating way.The cafe had a nice selection of food and was very good value."
Well worth a visit,We went with another couple. The reading matter was understandable & well set out. There seemed to be things to keep children occupied. Interesting to read about how those responsible came to decide where to dig & actually see where KR3 was found. Well worth the visit & to be recommended.
Interesting ,"All members of staff were friendly and knowledgeable, a lot of effort has been put into the centre to create an interesting environment. Would have liked a little more seating in the first recording area.An excellent visit."
Good but too much background noise,"This was our first visit and we enjoyed it and are glad we made the journey. It is a very nice, clean and modern building. The entrance fee seemed fair and we were happy to sign up to gift aid. The staff were professional and helpful and the gift shop as you would expect. The cafe is very good, reasonably priced and immaculate. We had both coffee and cake there on arrival and lunch when we had finished. We spent two and a half hours looking around.There are two floors. The ground floor covers Plantagenet history and the first floor the discovery of Richard’s body. I remember watching this on TV and enjoyed revisiting it. The highlight of the visit for me was seeing the reconstructed face taken from the skull measurements.However, what I didn’t like was the film that played continually on a loop in the entrance hall. It was far too loud and I could not concentrate on reading the information in the first room which was about the family tree, time line and battles. PLEASE turn it down.Also, visitors should be aware that a great deal of reading is required. This attraction is not one for small children who like to press buttons, lift flaps, dress up or run around. It is not interactive. This was absolutely fine for my husband and I although, as stated before, I couldn’t concentrate to read where the film was playing.We then went across to see tomb in the Cathedral and I felt quite moved."
Not worth the entrance fee .....,We visited as a family with grand children a complete disapointment virtually nothing to interest kids or adults just a lot of pictures and meagre information about the find. You will get more information and see the kings tomb next door in the cathedral the people there are more informative and it's free nothing to pay......don't waste your hard earned money on this centre a complete waste of time and money.
Comprehensive historical displays.,We’d visited the Bosworth Battlefield the same weekend so hadn’t initially planned to go in here but once outside we decided to do so.It is reasonably priced but gives an up to date display and real insight into the character and rediscovery of the remains of Richard III. There is some historical background but the most interesting part is the upstairs room about the excavation and rediscovery. Also very interesting to see the actual grave site which is in a little annexe at the end of the tour. Gift shop is also small which is a nice change.An interesting visit in the centre of Leicester and opposite the Cathedral where Richard is now interred.
Immersive history at its best - wow,I like history but didn’t know the full story of Richard the 3rd. Super knowledgeable staff on site all very passionate about the subject and lots more. Very immersive and so much to see and learn about. Just wow. Not to be missed.Family visit on weekend trip to Leicester and loved by all.
Highly Recommended ,"Really enjoyed our visit to the centre today. The discovery of the King in the car park is a remarkable story and it's very well told here. Good use of technology and different media means it's always interesting. The site of the excavation and grave is particularly well done, very tasteful. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the cafe was good quality and well priced. Well worth the trip from Wolverhampton, we really enjoyed it."
first ever visit last week,visited last week with family and family ticket was very reasonably priced albeit card machine not functioning and had to pay cash. great story around Richard and the war of the roses and even saw where his body was discovered
Worthwhile,Slightly dubious at the entry price but we enjoyed our visit. Not a huge amount of exhibits and no contemporary artefacts really - the story is told with words pictures and film. They cover the life and lineage of Richard and then the research and discovery of his body. The place where his body was found can be viewed through a glass floor. Its done in a tasteful way and is quite moving really. The rest of the car park is just visible through a small window so you can get some context as to where he had lain.Its a great story which I will never tire of. The cafe was very pleasant with a range of snacks or meals which came with fresh veg/salad and generous portions there was also outdoor seating
"Fantastic tour, great activities to do, and wonderful lunch","Good value with a yearly ticket allowing us to return for free for a full year. Had a wonderful filling lunch in the cafe. The design of the exhibits it creative and engaging and the volunteers are very enthusiastic and entertaining.Dean and Ella, U.S.A."
An enlightening experience,An excellent attraction which brings out the true history of Richard III and puts paid to Shakespeare's fiction! You are treated to a good bit of history and detailed timelines of the War of the Roses and Richard's rise to power and his fall. There is also a fantastic display explaining in great detail how his body was found. To finish there is the opportunity to see his now empty grave. Throughout we were treated to some excellent talks from the guides. Highly recommended attraction.
Brilliantly done and educational,"Let me start by stating that Richard III is my favourite English monarch and I believe him to be maligned by historians and especially William Shakespeare!  He was certainly no saint and committed his fair share of misdemeanours, but not the extent that we are intended to believe.  The visitor centre is just amazing and a great visit, whichever side of the RIII fence your are situated.  I learned facts about RIII that I did not know and found the whole experience very good.  There is a lot to take in and one visit was not really enough - information overload.  My wife was with me and we bought the tickets that allow unlimited return visits for one year.  We will certainly be back to learn more.  I can highly recommend this venue if you are in Leicester  and have a couple of hours to fill."
"Brilliant, Informative and Moving","We enjoyed our visit here very much; the displays give a good context to the Wars of the Roses and the upstairs exhibition, giving details of the archaeological dig and the scientific identification of Richard III's body are particularly fascinating. Being able to see the grave site is a moving experience, especially as you can then go across the road to see Richard III's tomb in the cathedral."
Great exhibition,Excellent experience! Very informative and plenty of “hands on” interactive displays. Helpful staff nice cafe Tickets valid for a year!
loved it,"very informative , lots to see and do. Gives lots of details about the wars of the roses , the battle of Bosworth and the death of Richard the third. Amazing to see how they discovered his body and the actual grave site. The cathedral is right beside the centre and you can then go and see the tomb , very moving."
Brilliant ,"Excellent and informative visitor center well worth a visit. The center is great for children and families, the information about the dog and the science behind the discovery is well thought out and easy to understand. I especially loved the way they have left the site uncovered and placed a viewing platform over."
A little gem,"Wasn’t expecting to enjoy this as much as we did. Very well presented stepping through the historical and political context of Richard III time, his performance as a monarch, the story of the discovery of his remains and blended with the science around the discovery. Good interactive displays. Culminates in seeing the excavation where he was found. Cross the road to the cathedral and visit the final resting place."
Another Hidden Gem,"One of the places I have been meaning to visit for a little while and it was well worth the wait. The whole approach was very well done from start to finish and if you like lots of historical facts you will not be disappointed. The story of how they found the body and the process they went through is quite amazing and compelling. The staff and volunteers could not have been more helpful and were extremely knowledgeable.The little canteen on site was also excellent and again they had some great staff. If you are driving to Leicester then don't try and go into the centre go to the park and drive, which is only £4 all day return for four people. To follow on you must go to the Cathedral where Richard final resting place is."
Very interesting and definitely worth visiting,"The original site of the dig which uncovered Richard III's skeleton, the excavation site still visible under glass at the end of the tour. The very succinct Battle of Bosworth field timeline is incredibly vivid and fascinating, I really got a sense of where Richard and Henry were and what Richard thought he was doing. Doubt the visitor centre read these reviews but they have a few actors who have played Richard III listed upstairs, and have spelt the name of one of the most famous interpretations of the last 50 years incorrectly: it's Antony not Anthony Sher. A very minor detail I know! If they ever bother to correct this I hope they take the time to bring the acting time line up-to-date (Ralph Fiennes last yea among others). I liked this small section a lot (have Laurence Olivier film on a faster loop, I caught the tale end and waited ages, it seemed, for it to come back on). This detail will definitely NOT spoil your visit to a brilliant visitors centre!"
Great histriy,Visited this today! Was an excellent insight into some of the history of Britain. Gives you a modern look into the war of the roses which was great and some good knowledge. It really flows well and is worth a look around. Really like how the grave site is still visible and the staff are helpful.
Finding King Richard,The visitor centre is located in the Old Town.I chose not to travel by car as the Bus station is only 12 minutes away & this meant I didn't have to worry about parking also meaning I could go at my own steady pace The experience is laid out in a walk through type of way starting with stories of the people in Richards rise to being King of England and all of the shenanigans that surrounded him As you carry on walking you can't help but really start rooting for The Man Moving through time and history you reach the gallery where the finding of the body is detailed and then the description of the forensic work that was done to bring about a positive identification One note The Kings body is not here but in the Cathedral just a short walk away
Good school trip,Been here for private visits and took a group of primary school children here.A fantastic 'new' attraction in the centre of Leicester. The area has had a massive lift with Good King Richard moving to Leicester and all the new investment and development to match.I'd say a visit to the cathedral is a must to see the burial stone for RIII.
Very informative exhibition,"We spent 90mins here and found the background storytelling useful.Joe the curator was very knowledgeable on medieval weapons, especially the poleaxe."
Amazing,"As an amateur historian, with a particular fascination with the Plantagenets, I have been dying to visit. It's a story which would appear far fetched, were it not true and it's brought to life in this visitor centre. My only criticism is that as a Yorkshire lass, I feel Richard should have been returned ti his roots, the place he grew up in, but I do understand why he's in Leicester."
Second time to visit ,I visited the centre during the school holidays and found the experience very peaceful and relaxing despite it being the school summer holiday in Leicester. The centre is very well laid out and informative. The grave site is very peaceful and very fitting for a grave site.
Well worth a visit,"The King Richard 111 Centre is well worth a visit. It is extremely well laid out and the science behind the identification of Richard is particularly well presented and very interesting. The background material on the various families involved in the War of the Roses, Neville’s, Stanley, etc is a bit bewildering to the casual visitor but excellent for committed enthusiasts of the era. The space in the centre is fairly limited but it is excellently used."
A Most Interesting Museum,"The whole layout of the museum was excellent as it leads you through all the aspects in chronological sequence.If anything, there was much too much information to take in on one visit. Fortunately, the tickets are valid for more visits.We were highly entertained by a very knowledgeable guide who told us about the discovery of the grave and subsequent events."
A good history of Richard 111,"This is for those interested in teh English history of 500 years ago. It is obviously more interesting as they found his bones on the site but you can actually see the spot where he was buried in 1485, That is quite something. His bones are now in teh cathedral so visit there afterwards. A good well documented exhibition if a little expensive."
A good experince,"Went on a wet day mainly to dry out and have a coffee, cafe was very good and spotless, service with a smile. The story is told in an engaging way and flows from Finding it to history all well done,"
A treat for our American guests.,"My best mates Son and his girlfriend came  home over christmas, and on one of the days I took my two and those two for a visit to the centre, after visiting the Kings resting place over the street at Leicester Cathedral(worth a visit in itself).this was also my first visit.It is very informative,with a short animated film at the beginning then mostly written accounts throughout the first two sections(not really for very young kids,I would say 10yrs plus to fully enjoy).Then you go upstairs,a full recreation of  the Kings skeleton,showing in detail his wounds and death blow.info on DNA,how face reconstruction works,with a touch screen.Armour etc etc.then finally you enter the room above the excavation,with glass floor and a projection of how the Kings bones were found.minus the feet,got to love the victorians.All and all its well worth the money,it cost me just over 26 quid for a child,three teenagers and myself.If you are planning to come,please do.along with a visit to the Cathedral,its a worth while dayout."
"Very interesting, especially where skeleton was found!","We enjoyed our walk around the Visitor centre. There is a lot of reading to do. I wish I had read up about this prior to going. Lots of info on historical perspective and how Richard’s skeleton was discovered. Clean and modern presentation throughout. Ticket can be used all year for repeat visits, which is great. Some artifacts on show too. Suits of armour etc. Only takes an hour or so but very interesting."
A surprise,"Literally turned a corner and found the cathedral,the staff were extremely knowledgeable about the church and the history of Richard 111"
Really interesting.,Well thought out and a really interesting place to visit.Puts it into perspective and only a short walk from Richard III final resting place.
Very expensive and prices due to go up again! ,"It cost us 21-22 pounds for a family of three. This allows us to visit for the entire year. I personally don't know why someone would want to visit again.It took us just over an hour to complete the visit. Infact my daughter and I sat making creative drawings on the children's table, most of the time. I agree with previous comments there is way too much text, you do get fed up of reading. Not enough interactive stuff on offer to keep children entertained either. A refurb is due to take place and the price is due to increase again. I wonder will this involve anything new or improving any of the museum.Im glad I am from Leicester and did not travel far to visit. I would have been very disappointed."
Enjoyable and Informative,"Had a great time with my daughter yesterday - excellent displays and guides were friendly and knowledgeable - a special mention for the two young men on the front desk who were both welcoming and helpful. We found the whole experience both interesting and emotional. Came away feeling we had a real understanding of Richard and his history. We also went across to the Cathedral to see where Richard is interred, again a very moving experience. Very highly recommended to anyone interested in Richard and his life. We will definitely return."
Excellent,"It is very well put - it has everything - from a short video, to informative posters and even 3D stuff.  Very informative and basically recommend it."
A royal visit!,This place is so amazing; explains the history of Richard III and the War of the Roses and how the whole project of finding him in the car park happened! You also get to see the site he was found in! Every staff member was very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject!
Very enjoyable,We had a great visit to the King Richard III museum. Very informative and eye opening to the story of how the remains were found. Really good value for money.
Nice to look at,Isn't worth going out your way to see but it's nice to have a look as its a part of leicesters history.
Do not miss a chance to visit!,"Do not miss a chance to visit the visitor centre or the Cathedral. I originate from Leicester and used to work on King Richards Road. there was a plaque next door which read 'Near this place lie the remains of Richard III'  and I always wondered exactly where they were. I can't believe I used to pass within yards of his resting place every day. I think the effort put into finding him was amazing and it does seem right that he remains in Leicester.I eventually got to the Cathedral and Visitor Centre this year and can't recommend it highly enough - young and old will find it fascinating.On a final note, take the time to sample the food in the restaurant it's delicious."
Well worth a visit.,"A great mix of history and story of a truly remarkable modern day discovery. The staff/guides are very friendly and helpful. Very well laid out and presented. Good café there, my only complaint being that it was a bit on the chilly side (room temperature). I highly recommend that the visit be combined with a look around the cathedral, too, where there is a lot more to see and, again, very helpful guides. Don't miss the short audio visual guides in both the visitor centre and the cathedral. Overall an amazing experience."
A year of free repeat visits included in the entry ticket,"Excellently presented with a huge amount of information. You need to spend quite a bit of time to absorb - I spent two hours and only got through the lower gallery. Will be going back for free next week on the same ticket to look at the science of the discovery in the upper gallery.Information is presented in an interactive and varied way, so probably good for children from about 8 upwards.Friendly staff who seemed to be really proud of their jobs and pleased that visitors were interested in the exhibition."
Dream came true,"Having been a complete “he should have been buried in York” I am now converted to Leicester . The cathedral is the right place but the sarcophagus is still too ugly and too modern.  The visitors centre was totally brilliant with loads of explanation about the background, reign and the dig itself. From a first floor window you could see the grave site and relationship between the car park and the various buildings. The grave site is exposed under glass with a hologram of the skeleton, it was amazing to see and its relationship with the original floor tiles. On the wall they had the words that were inscribed in Richard’s book of hours in his own hand. I am so happy I got to go."
Group visit to RIII visitor centre,"I arranged a visit for 25 members of a group, from across the Country, who were visiting the area.  I found it really easy to find prices etc from their website and had a good response from them by email.  I made a preliminary visit alone and spent much longer there than anticipated.  It was a fascinating story well presented.  The icing on the cake was to find the grave site still visible with a glass cover over which I could walk.  I was also able to purchase through them a ticket for a tour of the Cathedral and RIII tomb. The eventual visit in April was much enjoyed by the group who and several of them afterwards commented to me that it had raised their interest in RIII and they planned to do some more reading on the subject.  Staff were very helpful and there was a comfortable cafe on site to end our visit."
Thorough look at Richard III,"A very modern, interesting look at King Richard III. Learning about the genealogy through to the discovery of the skeleton in the now infamous car park.The displays are interesting but a lot to read through.Great informative staff."
A great mixture of history & science.,"You could spend half a day here. Better still to visit twice if you have time. (Passes last a year I think.)So much to see and take in. But accessable to children as well. This is one of the best, most informative, displays that I have ever been to. You do need to visit the Cathedral as well to complete the story."
Great trip,"Very informative and lovely, helpful staff. Worth the money and the pass lets you in for a whole year so can revisit. Cafe had lovely cake"
"Superb, it made me weep. ","What an amazing place! The historical significance of King Richard 3rd has undoubtably not always been completely appreciated. Luckily for the folk who found him in the car park the stories which surround him have been coloured by Shakespeare and the actors that have portrayed him in the last 80 years or so, and so raised him in our consciousness. The centre places him exactly where he ought to be. Rather than as a villain, we see him as the man he probably was. The facts and evidence is laid out clearly and pragmatically, but above all unsentimentally. His resting place in Greyfriars is displayed wonderfully and I found it deeply moving that our last Plantagenet king laid there for over 500 years, undiscovered. Absolutely worth the visit, it made me feel deeply proud and happy that he has finally been laid to rest appropriately in the Cathedral."
Thorough History of Richard III,Well laid out comprehensive story of Richard with actual grave site on display. Well informed helpful staff and an excellent exhibition over two floors. Close to the cathedral where Richard was recently reburied
Fascinating story of King Richard lll,"We visited using a Groupon voucher. The attraction proved quite hard to find, as although there are plenty of banners on lamp posts advertising it, there are no signs to direct visitors there. Once inside however you can see the tremendous amount of work that has gone into telling Richard's story, and debunking some of the myths created in part by William Shakespeare, and then upstairs, there is a very detailed exhibition explaining how the body was found, excavated and identified using cutting edge scientific techniques. Be sure not to miss the actual grave site, housed in an annexe and covered by a glass screen, or the final resting place of Richard's remains in the nearby Leicester cathedral. One criticism is the visitor toilets, which can only be reached part way through the exhibition, and difficult to get to if you have completed the tour and exited to the gift shop."
Wonderful ,"One negative you don’t give discount to serving EMS or military. Why not?Right aside from that, totally fabulous place. Small and compact but every centimetre is compressed with artefacts, interactive exhibits, films and sound effects. Fabulous explanations of science and technical stuff. Very helpful staff and volunteers make place extra friendly. Cafe is great too. Richard is treated with due reverence as befitting a King and his grave is visible, but all done very tastefully. The explanation of the archaeology and story leading to the dig is well laid out. Very impressed. Great value."
Interesting to visit,"The centre is very well set out.  There is a lot to take in.  Too much for us for one visit,  so will go again,. The tickets are valid for one year so if you live nearby that is quite easy to do. There is a lovely coffee shop as well.  it is easy to get around."
“The King in the Car Park” - an astonishing story for history buffs and “Time Team” enthusiasts! Well worth a visit.,The King Richard III exhibition is well worth a visit in its own right but the astonishing story behind the discovery of the king in the car park gives it a totally different dimension. The exhibition is beautifully housed in an old school building which has been carefully arranged to provide ease of access for all. The ground floor houses the “history” element with details of the Wars of the Roses and King Richard’s short lived accession to the throne. It also dispels many of the myths that Richard III was an evil king - mainly down to Shakespeare’s politically motivated depiction. He passed many laws which were good for ordinary people and was the last of the true warrior kings personally leading his troops into battle.The story of the discovery of the body on the upper floor and in the actual car park however is the truly astonishing part of this exhibition and raised hairs on the back of my neck. The dedication and passion of Philippa Langley and the archeological team at Leicester University is at the heart of this exhibition and even if you’re not into history this story is well worth following. There was a Channel 4 documentary made at the time following the team as they made their dig and subsequent discovery. It’s still available on the internet and I would heartily recommend it in conjunction with this terrific exhibition.
Doesn't reflect the amazing discovery,"The actual story behind the discovery of King R  III is amazing but there is something a little pedestrian about this.  I don't like the first interaction to be  a bit of poor film, badly lit,  that is relatively badly delivered.  The kind of thing that might impress about 40 years ago.  I was quite shocked by that, actually.  Poor quality as an immediate experience.  The whole place feels a bit like they are stretching out what they have over various floors and a lot is boring.  How can it be boring!!!    The story of Richard is amazing but the way it is presented is lack lustre.  The lighting is poor upstairs. Flat white.   The space itself is great but not used well."
King Richard lives,"The Richard III Visitor Centre is excellent, it brings history to life and the guides provide facts and figures in a clear, informative manner. Well worth a visit for people of all ages."
"If you are in Leicester, visit here!","This centre is excellent.  The true story of Richard III has been so well told here. Whether you are new to the Plantagenet/Tudor story and Richard's story in particular, or a total history buff, you will love this place.  Seeing the 'car park' where he lay buried for so long, then crossing the road to the cathedral to view his final dignified and peaceful resting place, is really quite emotional.   And Philippa Langley is amazing!!"
Very well done.,"As a couple of seniors, we paid £8 each to go in here and by gift aiding we can go back free for a year.  I’m sure we will return because it is a fascinating place and tells the story of Richard 111 well with just the right amount of information. We were impressed by the fairly detailed explanation of the science used to determine that the bones really were those of Richard 111.It’s worth saying that there is a good cafe here too which by the standards of these types of attractions, offers very good value.It’s the sort of place that rekindles enthusiasm for history and makes you want to learn more.Will return for sure!"
Prepare and enjoy,"We had prepared ourselves with some documentaries and a visit to Bosworth Field first. There is a lot of information to get, as expected. There are talks that are very interesting. The”CSI” part for RIII is very interesting. The real Game of Thrones."
Very interesting history,Great place to visit if you're interested in this kind of stuff ! There's lots of reading & listening to do though so might be a little too much for younger kids to compute. I think 15+ year olds would get their money's worth.
Lovely little museum - Well worth a day trip from London,"We recently visited this wonderful little visitor centre and would highly recommend it. There is a lot of information displayed in a very engaging way throughout the centre and the staff are friendly and helpful.  They had a short arms and amour presentation on while we were there - the young fellow who did the presentation was dressed in period clothing and he conveyed a lot of fascinating information in a short amount of time.  The highlight for me was the peaceful room where they have the glass encased area showing where they actually found Richard III's body buried in a shallow grave beneath the choir floor of the Franciscan priory.  You can even see a bit of the tiling where the choir floor was and it gives you a good sense of how shallow the grave was.  Every minute or so they slowly light up an outline of the skeleton in the position that they found it and then it will fade and then slowly light up again. A soundtrack of monks chanting in the background really adds to the impact of this chamber. There was a volunteer in the room who was happy to answer any questions that we had.The facility itself is a delight, with good use of natural light in many of the rooms.  There is also a small cafe (with indoor and outdoor seating) and a gift shop as well.The visitor centre is located in Leicester and is easily accessible as a day trip from London (which we did).  It is about an hour train ride from London's St. Pancras Station and then a 15 minute walk once you get to Leicester.Don't miss going to see Richard III's tomb, which is located in Leicester Cathedral directly across the street from the visitor centre."
Well worth a visit!,"Extremely interesting exhibition, located opposite the cathedral. Some of the signage on the displays is difficult to read due to poor lighting and super-imposed projections, and the battlefield exhibit would benefit from  a clearer indication of what order to read things in. At the moment it is a little confusing. Anyone who has watched the 'King in the car park' documentary will be familiar with the upper-floor exhibit, which  makes the most of limited material (Philippa's wellies, really?). Best moment for me was seeing the burial site. Nicely understated, although this would benefit from  a more informative display. I only noticed the projected image of the skeleton when I overheard another visitor mention it. There were also historical re-enactors in costume, which made things interesting for the kids. A must-see if you're in Leicester, and well worth a visit."
Doing Leicester Proud,"No disappointments at all ...the centre is well thought out , very informative staff, try to lncorporate your centre visit with a cathedral visit...well done Leicester."
Must visit,"This is a very interesting place to visit, detailing a very important time in our history.  Lots of very interesting exhibits detailing Richard III's life and death plus the science behind checking the identity of the body and its discovery."
Interesting displays and information but a little difficult to follow the story of the dig.,"I loved the timeline and exhibition on the ground floor but found the info about the archaeological dig and finding Richard III remains a bit muddling. I missed the projected image of Richard III skeleton in the actual pit where the bones were found because I did not see anything to say to watch for it. Only one of our party of 6 witnessed the projected image, so it wasn't just me not being observant."
Spellbinding displays both of medieval history and modern science,"My wife and I visited the centre whilst taking a four day break in Leicestershire.I loved the way the history was brought to life in film and special effects plus interesting displays en route which helped to flesh out the Richard III story and his demise. My wife particularly enjoyed the story of the search for the remains and the wealth of information gleaned from the skeleton of the former king , a computer printed facsimile of which is on display and which bears the scars of battle. In addition to the fixed displays, there is a very entertaining talk and demonstration of arms and armour given by a very entertaining and knowledgeable young man in an area next to the actual grave site which is covered by a glass foor  so all details can be seen. The centre also has an excellent and competitively priced cafe on the ground. The centre is completely accessible for people with mobility problems and has a passenger lift operating between the two floors. An excellent way to spend a few hours, and the ticket is valid for 12 months, allowing you to revisit whenever you wish."
Very well presented,"I may be biased, as I find this period of history fascinating, and it may be less interesting for children, but I found the visitor centre to be very informative. The whole set up is very well presented, and despite presenting the grave of a centuries old King, everything felt very modern."
Not to be missed!,"This visitor centre is superb! Lots of visuals and audio information. Excellent written detail too and chronology available. We had a little stop half way round for a light lunch, as there is a lot to take in. The upstairs exhibits which focus on ‘The King in the Carpark’ are excellent. Lots to see and some interaction required with the exhibits. The guide/demonstrator with the sword and weaponry is incredible, well informed and very enthusiastic. Engage with him!The cathedral nearby if impressive with Richard’s tomb centre stage. Helpful staff in the cathedral are on hand to inform visitors about Richard and the cathedral. A fantastic visit which needs a few hours but well worth it. I am planning to return! This part of Leicester is beautiful - with cobbled/paved streets, ancient houses, pubs, deli style shops and coffee houses."
King Richard III visitor centre,"Excellent location opposite the statue of the King outside the cathedral, really formative centre with plenty for children to see and do and a nice cafe to have a rest before visiting the shop"
"Okay, if you enjoy this type of thing",I really like history so this was nice for me. However I took my teenage daughter and she was bored out of her mind. The exhibit is quite small and there isn’t a lot to do. It is really well done however. The outside looks gorg and the cafe outside is lovely for a cup of tea
One Star Lost For Lack of Signage,"We saw one sign on the way to the exhibition - are they not interested in passing trade?  We tried to find the park and ride, but our satnav didn't recognise the postcode, so we ended up in the rooftop carpark - £5.50 for 4 hours.  This was cheaper by 50p than the carpark next to the Holiday Inn, but the P&R would have been £4 for the two of us, for as long as we liked.We had a Groupon, but, even at full price this is not expensive for a couple of hour's entertainment.  The cathedral (suggested donation £3) is worth visiting, to see the tomb of King Richard and there is the bonus of the Guildhall, which is free to visit.  The staff at the attraction were knowledgeable and friendly, especially the man who talked about weaponry and swordfighting techniques.  I was more interested in the historical sections downstairs, whilst my wife preferred the information about the dig upstairs.A good half day's leisure activity."
Great!!,"Very impressed with the visitor centre. I visited with two Australian friends and they loved it. Lots of information for read and very modern. The centre does not take a long time to get around, so I would recommend taking time to read the information as you could be out within 10 mins if rushed. Don’t miss out on the stairs as the centre goes up the stairs which is worth seeing and great for kids too."
An experience befitting a king,"This visitor attraction takes you through the story of RIII through the wars of the Roses, the deciding battle at Bosworth Field right to the discovery of his remains in a car park. The whole story I see brought to life and is suitable for adults and children alike. You get to see the actual place where Richard was discovered and it is presented in a very befitting manner."
must see attraction when in Leicester,"the Richard III visitor centre is a must see attraction when in Leicester. a relatively new build it is well laid out and you can follow the story of Richard from birth through to his death at Bosworth Field.there is also the story of the archaeology and how they definitivley proved it was Richard they had found.tickets seem to be expensive (we paid £8.50 each) BUT not when you consider they allow you unlimited access to the attraction so it is pay once visit many times (or pass your ticket on to friends and relatives so they can get in for free!)the highlight has to be the actual grave they found in the car park which when you view it has an intermittent light image of the skeletonCombine your visit with a trip to Leicester Cathedral, which is literally just over the road from the centre"
Excellent,Very interesting and well worth a visit. Allow enough time to read all the panels. The staff were pleasant and helpful.
A piece of history brought to life!,"We visited the centre as a group of 53. The 'Two Princes' talk set the scene for a brilliant tour. The medieval banquet on the Saturday night was superb -  great food, excellent service and fantastic entertainment from the minstrels. A wonderful night was had by all!"
A brilliant exhibition,We have been meaning to visit for a while and finally got around to it.We decided to take the Park and Ride from Enderby (near M1/69 junction) which proved to be excellent. Only £4 for a couple and it delivered us to within about 300m of the R3 visitors centre.The exhibition was beautifully presented and very informative. The facilities were excellent and the conversion of the buildings done to a very high standard.I am definitely going to look up the Ch 4 programme “the King in the Car Parkland to find out more.The cafe was excellent and the prices of both the cafe and entrance fee were very reasonable. Staff were very friendly and engaging too.
One of the best,"Great visitor experience with everything you could ever want to know about this much maligned king. I would visit here first, then Leicester cathedral and then the battle of bosworth field exhibition near market bosworth."
Interesting place,"Visited yesterday, found it a really interesting place to visit . My tip is to come here first before going across the road to the tomb of Richard III. A great introduction to the history of Richard III downstairs with interactive displays. Upstairs takes you through the discovery of Richard's remains and how they were verified."
Eye opening experience,"The staff are very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. They were able to tell us what different parts of the cathedral signified and told us some history and interesting facts. The donation boxes dotted around fit right in to the structure and compliment the cathedral. Perhaps having a donation box especially designed for families which stands out would be useful to get donations."
Amazing,"30 of us visited this wonderful museum. We had a guide and split into two groups as half of us were foreign. I organised a German speaking guide as there isn't one available at the museum which was the only downside. The guide, Luke, was really good. He is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.We have been before and took two sets of grandchildren who loved it. It is a place for all ages."
Must visit while in Leicester,"For me, the King Richard III Visitor Centre is a must visit while in Leicester. It tells a very interesting story about the history of the War of Roses and then the events which led to the discovery of the remains of Richard III. The employees are very nice and helpful."
Boring ,Okay so we all get that this Richard the third business is BIG business for leicester but this place is an expensive and boring attempt to further capitalise on this now over played and irrelevant topic. The attraction like I said is expensive and if I were you I’d avoid going to it. The gift shop is stacked with mass produced and rather pathetic overpriced generic junk. I think most people that actually live in leicester would agree with my thoughts on this travesty.
Amazing,"I didnt know what to expect, but I was blown away with the displays, information and story telling at the centre.  This is a must see when visiting the area."
Nice Attraction but spoilt by noisy schoolkids,"Been wanting to visit for a while. Went to Leicester in March 2015 to see King Richard III's procession through the city so ony took me 3 1/2 years to return!!!Parked in St Nicholas Car Park (£9 for 4 hours) had no idea how to get there, poor signage so just headed for the Cathedral Spire!The Visitor Centre is opposite the CathedralIts an £8.95 adult admission price (that also means that you can revisit for up to a year but they need photo/ signature id!) wonder how many people do????The lady on the ticket desk said there was a school party in but they were halfway throgh. When we walked in the kids were there watching a film, shuffling about with teachers telling them to be quiet etc. Then when they had finished they made such a racket! other visitors doing the SSSHHHHHHH technique  to deaf ears, even the centre staff did nothing!The short film is intersting, Very effective lighing on the throne with two roses laid on it.Theres a side room but There is a LOT  of stuff to read, in fact a little too much. It should have had a mix of both,( there are interactve screens you can press with interviews upstairs), but wou;d have been better to have footage of the dig that discovered him, procession etc. we walked into the second downstairs room and the kids there again being noisy so gave it a miss!!!!Upstarirs there are some more boards to read, few costumes, and recreation of his bones. Also a recreation of his head/ Then you go back down to see the actual burial site he was discovered in. Its got a perspex floor, and they superimposed through lighting a silouette of his skeleton on the earth   . Very eerie but effective there was a volunteer and few people in there, but nothing else, such as audio. Maybe quiet reflective medieval music would have been a nice touch??The cafe was nice and reasonably priced. Gift shop is as you enter, minimal stock and overpriced I felt.Yes pleased I went, NOT pleased we had to endure noisy kids. I suggested by email  to the centre that the children that vist be given seperate times when museum not open. after all they are not paying but visitors like me and others that day, so its really unfair.Opposite is the King Richard III Statue  thats lovely, and Cathedral where he is buried opposite,Enjoyed parts of the visit, more physical items needed to bring the story alive. would have given this 3 stars but seemed unfiar so it only scraped through as a very good as I was in a generous mood! The Cathedral asks for donations on entry."
Really interesting if you take the time,"Some people complain about too much text and similar, but it's only if you want everything in sound bites that don't require you to actually think about what you're seeing. The data is sound, the presentation is excellent and the way it's laid out is very good. This place is well worth the effort - but don't expect it to simplistic."
Amazing ,"Interesting exhibition, knowledgable staff, lovely building. The Cathedral just across the road. Well worth a visit"
Last minute visit,Really pleased I went...excellent presentations..loved it. .very pleased formative and helpful staff.
Interesting museum,"Interesting exhibition - all about Richard III and how they found his remains.We thought it was quite pricey, but probably worth visiting once. You could use your ticket for return visits, but as we live in Nerw Zealand we are hardly likely to be able to make use of that!You have to cross the road to Leicester Cathedral to see Richard III's grave."
Interesting museum,The remains of King Richard the Third have only been recently found are on display in this somewhat pricey museum (although you can make return visits for up to a year - not sure why you would want to). How they pieced together where his remains would be is interesting and well worth a read.
Fascinating,People just love the idea that the remains of a King could be discovered under a car park! He was a controversial King and his remains were in a brutal condition - the archaeologists have been amazing and he has now come to rest in a place fit for a King. Worth a visit despite the price?
Richard Third Exhibition,Wonderful exhibition So informative and very reasonable £8 for Seniors and students and ticket lasts 12 months
Networking with a twist.,"Went to a networking event held here. I must say it was very clean, neat and atmospheric. Everything was laid out well and easy to navigate around. Not something for little ones."
Worth a look,"The whole thing takes up a nice couple of hours walking around and learning about the events leading up to the battle where Richard III was defeated and slain - and then more learning about how the archaeologists found and identified his remains.The grave site itself is also viewable.The only letdown was that some of the historical information was presented in a rather awkward timeline, so it wasn't easy for someone not already aware of the history to parse.Could also be a couple of pounds cheaper, but still worth the time."
Riveting Richard III,"A beautifully presented exhibition and exposure of the story of 'finding Richard'.  It was well presented, fascinating and full of interest.   The space over the area in which he was found was superb, very moving and had a great affect on us - I couldn't stop thinking about him.   Recommended as a visit for everyone."
Great place,Very impressed with how this visitor centre is laid out. Flows nicely with lots of interesting information and interactivity.
