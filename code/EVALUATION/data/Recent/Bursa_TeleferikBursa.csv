Nice but over priced ,I like the view for sure but it’s very expensive specially for people who live in Turkey tkt per person 105 TL and it was half way only as the rest closed due to COVID-19 I have no clue why
Bursa Teleferik,"It is absolutely worth going up the mountain.The ride is rather long and providing a great view around. The middle station was not operating when we have been there and also the upper gondola was not working, we were informed about it. The price seemed for me also rather high so make sure to get a good information about the prices in advance and don't hesitate to discuss if necessary.Up there you can go for good walks and also Picknick or BBQ. There are many places you can rest at or go to restaurants with fair prices and you can grill there as well."
Bursa tour,"Take a tour to bursa . Don't Missout on the the cable car ride up the mountain. And then again there's another ride to the very top( or by a snowmobile). During winter the view from the top is very breathtaking . U'll find a lot of travel agencies that offer a full day journey with interesting activities on the way (Riding a quad bike ,  visiting the turkish delight factory , jam factory , the 600+ year old tree and more )."
In Bursa - Just do it !,This is Mount Uludag. The way up there is from Tefferruc using a Teleferik. They have family sized Cable cars which can take you to the peak which stands at about 2000 metres high. Sometimes there is snow up there while is nice and sunny in the city below. Its a nice cool place for the summer.
You have to visit when you visit bursa ,"In the center of bursa telefrik station You have to visit when you visit bursa Need more development in uludag mountainRestaurants , cafes , entertainment places  Improve the road"
Let it snow,Bursa is a interesting place to go out and have fun.cable cars are great way to experience the view from top and take nice pix.we were so glad to see snow and take amazing photos while snowing.it was unforgettable visit to bursa.we sincerely thank our friends Ergan and Ayhan for taking us out.
Very long journey,Leaflet says that the ride is 22 minutes but it was more. You have first station (you just pass through it) and then Sarıalan station which you should get off and you can see the surroundings (1635m). After you have Kurbaga Kaya (1810.) Where you can reach the hotels and also take a minibus or taxi to go to your hotel or go to the chair lift stations to go to the higher skiing locations.
Amazing view,We really enjoyed the view in cable car during ride to Uludag. We feel save and not worry during the trip.
Must visit and try the skiing ,Have been there to top mounting with teleferik in Sat. Arrival was at 9 so there were no ques. However in the evening around 5 pm the que was very very. Big and had to que twice for both teleferik stoppers. Avoid weekend or if no options than plan to leave as early S possible.
Awesome experience,"Amazing views, super high telefrik. On a sunny day the snow is just beautiful. Highly recommended but not for those who fear heights"
Excellent experience ,"Absolutely stunning views, definitely would recommend to visit if you are in Bursa. I went on Sunday so the place was absolutely packed so i purchased fast track which was 350 TL . I went on my own but I think this can be split by up to 6 or 8 people. This gives you an opportunity to avoid all queues. I would definitely visit again and stay for a night to enjoy all winter sports. The trip is around 20 mins to the first mountain and then another 5-7 mins to the top. Kids will definitely enjoy it. Plenty of cafes and food shops there."
Amazing view,View is amazing. The ride is smooth.  Gives you a very good perspective of the city and mountains. Prices are different for tourists and Turkish citizen.
Long ride,"The cable car is quite long, with 1400m elevation change. Went only to the second station (from three available) as the last one is for skiing and I was not equipped for that. The ride was very stable, and the view is great, although anti-haze technology could be added to the window so we can see clearly from the cubicle."
A wonderful day in the snow,We spent a fulfilled snow day at Uludag. The cable car was efficient and well maintained. There is a change station half way. You can purchase any warm attire if needed. There are a few eating places at the top.  The kids skied.
Great fun & also to start exploring the historical legacy of Turk culture,Bursa overall is a great place to explore more cultural side of Turkey. Quite traditional and you'll see most local people around. Besides Teleferik there are plenty of places to visit.
Good Experience ,"I have used Bursa Teleferik on Jan 1, 2020 and overall it was a pleasant experience. There are two types of tickets:Normal Ticket for: 105 TL where you have to wait in the line for nearly 30 mins and exchange your cable car mod way (not a direct trip, yet the whole ride in both cars in almost 25-30 mins including the exchange)Fast Track Ticket: 225 TL, where you skip the line and don’t wait plus it’s a direct ride The above prices are for a round tripThe car itself is meant to accommodate 8 pax yet mostly are used by 6 only which is more comfy, views during the ride are amazingThe main drawback is in the stations where there is snow outside the floor is really slippery and many fall incidents happened including myself leading to some injuries; so it’s important to take care of this as inside the station we have no skiing gear and any snow on the floor makes it super slippery and leads to such incidents"
"Fast, Safe and wonderful",Well arramged telephraik All services available Rates are differenet for locals and tourists You also can buy fast track ticket with almost double the rate but for us we decided to take thr normal pass and we found that it was a very good decision as it was not croweded and max wait time we spent 10 mins
Turkey ,The idea behind this attraction is great. I had my ride during the evening and it was quite frankly- a waste of money. I couldn’t appreciate the snow or the forest. I would recommend this attraction during the day.
Birdseye view of Bursa,"Beautiful view of Bursa as the teleferik climbs up and up. We had lots of fun going up BUT coming back down was another story. It started raining hard and they had to stop the teleferik service for about an hour. People in the queue started getting impatient (some pushed their way to the front, others argued with the staff etc, someone else fainted in the queue as it was getting stuffy with so many people in an enclosed area). My family opted to wait at the cafe nearby. Another family we met opted to charter a bus down instead of waiting for the teleferik to start back up. By the time we left, it was dark n still stormy so the ride down was less comfortable."
Fast transportation,"Telefrik was a fast, nice and convenient way of transportation between Bursa and Uludag mountain. The ticket is 80 TL one way and 95 two way. If you booked a hotel there, ask them to provide your details to Telefrik management so you buy that ticket at 15 TL. Baggage is allowed in Telefrik not as most of people say."
Great cable car,"This is wonderful experience. We visited in Oct 2019. The fall colours were amazing below as we were going up in the cable car. On the top, Uludag, the weather was very cold. A hot tea is a must. However we could not go till the last station which is open only during winter sports."
Amazing cableway,We enjoyed a ride on this amazing cable way. It provides spectacular views of the town and as you go up into the surrounding mountain range. It is the longest cable way in the world and affords you beautiful views. A must do if you are in bursa at only 95 lira for a return trip.
Incredible cable way,It's costs 95 lira return and is an amazing ride. It's the longest cable way in the world with beautiful views of the city below and the mountain range above. Truelly an unforgettable experience.
Amazing View,"Have a wonderful experience!  The view was amazing! And the weather was so nice... When you feel cold, you could buy a cup of creamy hotmilk."
Bursa Galore,You can see the whole City of the Caliph from the top here. The price a bit pricey if you go direct you may need to use apps to get better cost
Incredible experience,It was terrifying and wonderful all at the same time... what a fantastic experience that I'll never forget.. check out you tube videos on Bursa Teleferik if you don't get the chance to go yourself
Highlights of Bursa,"The teleferik goes up to a couple of stops however at this point it only went up to the second stop which was good too. Its approx 22 minute journey and ticket costs 95l per person. You pay half if you have a turkish residency card. At the stop there are many food stalls and a small bazaar especially for stoles, shawls and coats. We enjoyed the ride going up and down the mountain with the clouds passing by and seeing thr whole view of Bursa"
Fabulous views,"There is two levels to go, usually it is not known that ticket includes the whole way up, but they drop out in the middle stop. It is really an extra ordinary beautiful view up there, but you are not going to know what you are missing till you see the whole way to the top of this extremely high mountain Uludag.Even we went in summer but I'm pretty sure it is much beautiful in winter.The view of Bursa from the top is becoming more fabulous when the cabinet slowly rises up. With tall pine and Chestnut trees and the whole city view it is a great experience and a must to do when visiting Bursa."
Beautiful,"If you visit Bursa it would make no sense no to go on the cable cars. So peaceful at the top, we didn't stop in the middle as it was abit crowded but right at the top the scenic views and fresh air was wonderful. The view during the cable car was really nice. All in all def worth a visit and so glad I done it."
Excellent place,"Excellent place, very nice view, excellent staff, I recommend to every person in the world to visit and enjoy lovely place."
Mixed experience,"95TL per person to go all the way to the top, quite expensive for Turkish prices. However facilities are in good condition and it is a long trip, composed of two stages. We would have loved to do a small hike, but we could not find proper info about that unfortunately. Ski resort on the top is totally uninteresting during summer."
Amazing and long Teleferik,"Very well organized, long trip in Teleferik with two stages up to the top of the mountain.at the first stage there was amazing activities, like walking in the forest or have a ride, but the most interesting one we experienced is the self BBQ, between the trees with the very good weather during the summer. You need to purchase what you need of meets with different types, and the restaurant staff will bring to you the fire to enjoy preparing the BBQ you want and don't forget to add some salads. it is little bit expensive comparing with the prices in downtown, but it worth in my opinion."
Summer time visit,"The Teleferik try is marvelous in winter. It is fine too during summer. Both are ok. However, I found it more attractive when snow covers most of the mountains. They would be white and the normal green would be hardly seen."
sky,it was a visit to this telefrek. it is small one and not interesting at all. I think it is better to be in the cable one which is higher and the length of it is much more.
Very beautiful place ,"Don’t forget to take a jacket , very nice place for enjoyment and relaxing .. but it would be more attractive if the take care of this place in term of cleaning and caring .. this place is like a heaven but it need more activities like slide and mountain roller coaster... but still it con"
A trip among the clouds,"The trip on Bursa's cable car is unique because it is amazing in any season or any weather, when I went on it, it was cloudy, the clouds spreaded among the trees on the mountain's foothill forming a charming view, in addition to the magnificent scene of the city of Bursa from above. but be careful don't buy any clothes from the shops at stage 1 or 2 because it cost 3 times than usual."
Bring a jacket!,"The view of Bursa as the cable car is heading up is stunning. It was very cloudy today when I decided to head up to the highest point of the ride. Remember to bring a jacket as it can be quite cold at the top. As I was alone, I mainly had the whole cabin to myself most part of the trip and had the best views. A must-try when in Bursa."
Spiritual Bursa... ,"Trip to Bursa was spiritual for me. The teleferik was surreal. The misty mountain uludag stands like a guardian. If you visit bursa, the teleferik is a must to do. We took VIP ticket that costed 200 lira."
Really expensive during summer,It's 95TL for the round trip during summer so they really increase the price ! But the view is really nice
It was a big surprise,"Probably the longest ride in the world about 8+ kilometers.at spots not for the faint of heart. the whole ride is awesome but when you get to the top that is something else, we went in summer so everything was green."
Different prices for foreigners,"The trip with telefrik (cable car) is great. What I didn't like is that foreigners pay 95 tl. while Turks pay only 45 tl, I think it's wrong and a kind of cheating."
Simply breathtaking ,"Bursa Teleferick (Cable car) Review Absolutely Amazing - Bucket List - Must Do I can not describe how fascinating the experience is. The height and scenic views are just AMAZING.. We got lots of lovely pictures and taking videos and pics of the sun setting whilst we were heading down we're just UNBELIEVABLE. We will all be going back soon. It's about £8 per person for an experience that lasts well over an hour. At the top there are shops and restaurants and if u want you can cycle back down, get a bus or even a taxi but we choose to return on the cable as it was so good."
Awesome,The bursa telefrik is said to be one of the longest in the world. The view on the way up is nothing short of amazing. The day we went there was no que. We took a taxi to the telefrik bought tickets for 90 lira and went all the way up. Whether you go up 2 levels or 3 the price is the same. There is a lovely market place on both levels with souvenir shops as well as restaurants.
Teleferik,Good adventure.. but the tickets are expensive ..  i think it worth a visit at the winter till spring ..  if tou are there at the summer and dont have time to visit ..  you will not lose
On the cable cars,Bought tickets for 95 lira for adults and 80 for children. Kids under 5 are free. Took the cable car up to the mountain ...magnificent views ....takes approximately 20 - 25 mins ...there are stops on the way ...pretty expensive to buy gifts at the stop off stations. When you get to the top or second station it's pretty cold take a warm jacket even though it was summer . City is bustling very clean and neat
1st thing to do in  Bursa,An amusing place where you can spend the minimum of two hours in Bursa's mountain.It has 3 different levels of hight.Up there you can find cafe restaurant gift shops....
Amazing cool clean weather ,"If you love nature and BBQing your own lunch, this is the place. But wear something warm just in case. It can get very cold even in the summer."
Riyadh,"You have to visit this wonderful place with great view on the mountain, but my advice to visit this place without arrangement with any tour agencies so you can spend your own time and enjoy the amazing moments."
Longest teleferik in the world,"Bursa Teleferik is a must do thing in all turkey, if you are near bursa or visiting Istanbul you have to visit it and ride the longest teleferik in the world and see the outstanding views of the mountains and ice."
World's longest telpher line,A unique experience riding up the longest Teleferik in Turkey and the world. The cable car that can accommodate up to 8 adult passengers runs 9 km above the green mountain of Uludağ to reach Sarıalan station at an altitıde of more than1600 meters.
Price,I have very bad experience.im Turkish.my wife she is not from turkey.when o buy ticket I saw two different prices.ticket was 45 tl for Turkish people.95 tl for another country people.i never see like that ticket prices in the world.only in Bursa thank you you did very good job.i give voice from another country people don't buy tickets until when they change price.
Lovely trip in Istanbul country side,The Bursa & Mt. Uludag road trip from Istanbul is very memorable. The  trip is through the countryside from Istanbul and this trip is worth taking. The rope way at Mt. Uludag is a good experience. This is a ski resort. The slopes were snow covered even during summer. The food served at the restaurant was delicious.
"Great view, responsive staf",I read once in Tripadvisor that luggage are not allowed in cable car. I was worried and emailed to Bursa Teleferik whether true or not. Luckily they response my email and give the positive answer.
Family visit to Bursa,"We went to there when we we're at travel to Bursa. Bursa teleferik is an old and famous teleferik in Turkey. And also, its more important for me because my late father was work there from foundation with Sweden engineers and later he was worked as manager for fist five years. If you go to Bursa, you have to visit and use that Teleferik for going to Uludağ. It's so beautiful. I advise all of you."
Nice,One should go up and see Uludag by this Bursa Teleferik. Was comfy and affordable. The view was great
Teleferik,If you go to Bursa you must visit bursa telefericIt’s a nice small vacation to uludag with great views of city and mountain
Breath taking views,Very modern functional cable car which offers wonderful views of the scenery and Bursa below. I suspect it gets very busy in the ski season so unless you are a skier I would avoid
Uludag in April,"Hi All,I and my wife are planning to visit Uludag on 5th April, 2019. I will be glad if someone can answer the following questions.1. Will there be snow in first week of April.We do not plan to ski but enjoy the snow, walk on it and click pictures?2. We are taking a BUDO ferry from Istanbul @08:30 and then plan to take the F3 bus to the Teleferik at 10:30. How much time will it take? What will be the cost of ticket and where can I buy it ?3. Are there long queues at Teleferik ? What is the approx wait time ?4. I read that cable car can take me directly to the top with a change in between in 30-45 mins.However I also read, once I reach the top cable station, I have to take a bus to reach the main area.Is that true ?5. We have a tight schedule so we are planing to take a taxi back from Teleferik to ferry station.How much will it cost ?"
Great,"Just took the teleferik yesterday, costs TL80 per person, you will stop at sarialan and change to another cable car to kurbaga kaya. Once at kurbaga kaya, just take a minibus to uludag around TL3.50 per person. Rental equipments are available at uludag."
Spoiled by Rip Off Charging,"We always use the Teleferik and the service itself is excellent. However, this year you suddenly have to show ID to buy tickets. Why? So that they can charge you 65lira if you are a foreigner instead of the 35lira that Turkish people pay. This would be illegal in most European countries and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of tourists who have come to spend money in Turkey and who will tell others that they were deliberately over charged when they get home. What a shame."
Illegal practice,"I have just used the cable car. They charged me 35 lira but my wife 65 lira for being a foreigner. They do compulsory id checks to ""catch"" foreigners."
Worth to ride,We ride until the last station. The ticket is 80TL/person. It is wonderful to see the snow. The scenery is incredible..white snow field with blue sky.
great experience,"dont miss the telefrik one of the best things to do in bursa , great view. enjoy the ride to the top"
Best see,Well the  best of bursa and it was snowing however make sure you arrive as  early as possible to avoid long que.
Meet you at the top,"Our first visit to Turkey, Bursa is like stepping back in time, with the wonderful old buildings, street stalls and people.Our tour guide took us to the Teleferik (Cable Car),we left the city behind and we went up the mountains. Passing a beautiful forest.Once you reach the top you will be bombarded with different merchants trying to sell their products. Then you step out in the snow fields.We didn’t stay ever long because of the time schedule. My advice would be to be prepared for cold adventure, we were lucky to get a dusting of snow while there.My family was pleased and we got some great photos."
The first activity to do,Was terrfic experience it is like you are on the top of the world very percious moments..... it shows you all bursa and sea frim above then going to mountain
Amazing,"It was freezing cold, but the experience was amazing. We all enjoyed out time there. Property is well served with bathrooms and shops to buy any needed stuff for such weather as gloves, boots, etc.. It was really worthy!"
Wonderful,Amazing journey up the hill. Snow capped mountain. All the way to the top we managed to see snow.. Wonderful and unforgettable experience
WOW,Very good and nice experience but take the first closed telefrik 20 minutes not the second open one 15 minutes it will be more safe and suitable
Green bursa,Its amazing site and beautiful place. Can see around snow. 5000m height from sea level and green trees. In the city down part totally different but while reach on the top can see whole city and beautiful landmark and whole city.
Snow again,Do you know? Bursa “Teleferik” cablecar is the longest in the world?From 150 meters to 1800 meters altitude and 9 km.
Trip to bursa telefrik  ,"I reached there late unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy too much there so I prefer to you to visit earlier. Too much top if someone scare i advise u do not try. In top there is outdoor and indoor seating to have tea but is extreme expansive this is exploitation of tourists from my opinion for example one cup of tea is 10 lira i dont know but is my opinion. But place in top u will enjoy the view, thanks."
Never miss it ,Just go there but preferably in the winter. It was unforgettable experience my sisters and I enjoyed ❄️
Ride in the heaven,"After going to the top using the bus, we used the telefrik to go down the city. The ride was amazing it was something like heaven, watching all the autumn colors of the amazing trees, and see how high we went in the first place, it is a must do when going to bursa."
A Long Cable Car Ride - GREAT,"The cable car ride is the highlight.  It is a long ride and that was only up to the first station.  Bring warm clothes if you get cold easily.   We saw a restaurant there that looks like fun where you grill your own meal and the BBQ Grill Set is set beside the table.  I thought that looked fun and smelled good. Up in the mountain is really relaxing, take time to stroll and enjoy the fresh air and do not get distracted with the shopping.  PS.  Note they have a VIP ticket which you can cut the line and you do not have to share your cable car ride.  So for those who are strict on staying in line.  Do not jump on anyone here for not falling in line."
Amazing,We went with a group. We didn't wait that much. The guide get the tickets for us.the trip to the mountain was very organized. And we didn't experienced any trouble. I can't wait to visit bursa again
"Comfortable, clean, efficient, with wonder views","Always great riding a cable lift. This time as well. Views are just amazing, and the shift in temperature is stunning, when the cable car opens its doors st the top.We went up before noon, and didn’t have to wait for the lift. On the way back some hours later, the queue was very long, but well orchestrated.Every car is cleaned in a matter of seconds in Bursa before the next 8 passengers enter."
Crowded,I really want to use it. When come I saw big queue. Waited 45 minutes to buy a ticket. Fortunately I could. BUT maybe 500 people were waiting telefirik:)))AmazingNice lady who has blonde hair and blue eyes helped me and gave my money back. Employee are perfectAtmosphere is badIt's your decision for wait or not
"Nice view but cunning, lazy and greedy organizers.","1) There are two tickets windows, a long queue stands in one of them. The consultant on the street stays near other window, picks his nose and does not suggest you go to another free and open ticket window 2) Only 50% of the cable-way works. People get out halfway, but the cost of a ticket is 100% – 75 TRY!3) People are distributed to the cabin according to their face: some pair of goons are sitting inside just together, some other people putting inside up to 8 persons, some other gangs going inside without waiting their turn and with help of the security guards!__________Of course cable-way is the main non religious/historical attraction for folks in Bursa, views are amazing (only if there are no clouds), but mentioned troubles are leveling the merits."
"OMG, this is a must. excellent fun and a good ride to the first point.",Scary a bit but worth the effort and time to go up this mountain. Quite chilly at the stop but really fun to go up and up in this cable car.
Amazing views,Iys really amazing view i think if u visit to bursa u most see that telefrik its nearlly 8 KM high ..............
Pleasant Trip in a Forest,We went up for 4.5 KM in a green forest. The cabins had high quality and they were totally trust worthy. The staff were nice. The scene you see on the way up- i should say VOW!.
Easy way for climbing to top of mountain,It was a fantastic trip to top. It took 45 minutes. We changed the vehicle at second station. There are a picnic area at the first station. We used the second vehicle to reach the hotel area. There are small shopping malls.
Well organized and deserves to be attended many times again.. the forest look below is amazing..,Well organized and deserves to be attended many times again.. the forest look below is amazing.. the park at the last upper destination is nice the climate there is cold although it is August.. the restaurants at the mid station need to be enhanced as well as the shopping area..I will advise you to get a Sahlab hot drink at the top ..Very important tip: if the teleferik stopped moving at any moment you should not get panic.. it usually takes a few seconds to move again.. I guess that such stopping happened due to some safety restrictions due to the wind speed sometimes..Tip 2: tickets for adults cost 67TL per person and 58 TL for the kids above 4 years old.I highly recommend it..
A must if you're in turkey!,"For me if i went back to Bursa in August i would probably pay skip the line, it took ages to get to the teleferik. anyways the view is really cool for seeing most of Bursa city, and i think everyone would have a great time."
Bursa telefrik,A great experience high distance with magnificent views a day to remember a lifetime. There are many shops to buy gifts and delicious food stores. Quad bikes and othet activities are available including visiting mosques and having a nice picnic in the gardens.
Must be experienced,"Urs will be an amazing to see the amazing combinqtion between city, sea, and greenberg while smelling the breezy air of bursa."
a great telefrik,i found the small telefrik is good and worth the try but when you in the telefrik up high they just stop it 😂😂 so you feel like it is ruined or something. it is a good one you have to try it.
A must in Bursa,Great way to see the mountain and the city. It collects queues in weekends but it worths. Great thing also for kids
Fabulous Place ,"Very unique place , longest Teleferik that take you safely to the top of the mountain, expensive tickets, very crowded during weekends, but it worth the price, the air at the top is extremely fresh.Three stages if climbing , the second one is at the middle distance and you must go out the cabin walk and enjoy the wood and restaurants and you can rent bikes or motorbike , then you must switch to another Teleferik to continue climbing.During summer , at the top there is wide space you can enjoy barbecue or attend one if restaurants , you can walk and breathe the fresh and clean air.You can spend all day in this adventure, make sure to bring your best camera ."
Two visits this year,"We visited the place in January this year and found it full snow and we were not able to move around the area at the top second station. The snow was enjoyable then and it had covered the mountains. However, it was not the same on August. We had enjoyed it more differently using the electrical bikes to see greens covering the mountains up there."
Fantastic View of Bursa,First time to ride this teleferik and it's the best teleferic experience ever. The ride duration is around 25 mins which allowed me to enjoy the panoramic view of Bursa.The queue was somehow long but a cabin arrives every 20 seconds so we didn't wait for long. I strongly recommend this for anyone who's visiting Bursa :)
one of the most exciting adventure ,very nice place its suitable for kids and adults if you go early in the morning you don't need to wait in long rows .
Amazing,The new Teleferik is really amazing and so beautiful and safe to ride. Around 30 minute to reach the top but really beautiful way
Fantastic,This is gonna be the most complete review about how you get to bursa teleferric i hope.  first you should go to yenikapi IDO terminal and take a ticket for 31 liras to bursa.  (i think there is same in eminonu terminal but I'm not sure)  the ticket is cheaper if you can buy online and you don't have to wait in line but it does not matter much because the line is not long for bursa. The ships are hourly but i recommend you go early because it's a long way and you need time to enjoy the very beautiful teleferric and catch the last ship for getting back to Istanbul. When you reached bursa buy a bursa cart and top it up with about 20tl for each person. You will get off the ship in bursa ferry terminal if you take IDO   ships or Mudanya terminal if you take BUDO ships. Anyway at both terminals you have to take buses with number GY1 (at bursa ferry terminal)  or M1 (at Mudanya)  to get to metro Emek station.  get off in Osman gazi station walk few minutes to bus station and get on bus number S2. It will take you to teleferric.  You can take the same way for return in the same way.  About two hours in ship and 1.5 hours to teleferric so it's kind of long way but if you like traveling on the blue sea and passing between olive trees  it will not make you tired. Teleferric ticket is 67 tl for adult. 130 tl especial ticket.( you don't have to wait in line and just your family in cabin) it takes 50 min to go and return if you don't want to stay up there for a while which i don't recommend. Hint: in the teleferric a Turkish woman told me there is bus from istanbul to bursa ans takes about 1.5 hours and 30 liras. But I'm not sure because of language barrier. Hint: exchange your money in istanbul you hardly can find a place in bursa. But shopping is much cheaper.
Amazing but...,Went this afternoon with my family it was great and the experience was amazing till we got to the top were it got very touristic.. all sorts of things going on from people taking pictures of you to parrots to people yelling trying to get you to eat at the restaurants.. which are actually cool but annoying.. you get to grill your own food but the smole ruins the whole purpose of going 6000 ft above sea level for the fresh air.. if you walk for 10 or 15 mins you can get away from all that circus and have a nice walk at in the woods which is extremely nice and quiet
You should take it to the 'to do list'!,A nice activity to have nice bird eye view of the city for the families or others. The are many fast food facility at the up stations. You can spend there happy 2-3 hours.
Bursa Teleferik,"Advise anyone to visit Teleferik nice views area, people are very friendly. There so many sovereign items to buy it. View on top of mountains were clear no winds to scare anyone."
A well run operation but more officers needed,"It seems the authorities running this facility have doubled the price to around 67 TL per person, but it is worth every cent for the round trip ticket. The views are breathtaking and air is fresh. Many Gulf Arabs try to skip the queue with their usually big groups, which can become chaotic even on a less busy week day. More officers needed to keep the order and prevent children from throwing plastic bottles on fresh green grass. What a pity. Otherwise it was worth spending the afternoon up there with the family."
Great view but not much tourism planning,"The view is amazing. The trip itself goes for about 25 minutes (round trip there and back). The cabins themselves are clean and sturdy. A nice experience.The price of tickets are a bit expensive for what it provides. Being out of snow season there is not much to do once you arrive at the peak. It has a bunch of deserted shops, piles of rubbish, construction, no real sitting or viewing area(s) and a lot of overpriced items (a handful of which are actually relevant to Uludag itself).You do get a nice view of Uludag in the distance (a bit further away that you would expect).It has parking on site (for a fee)."
Beautiful city,"I love this city, it is my second visit to this beautiful city,Habitants are nice and helpful.Awsome views from the telefrikSurely I will visit again."
Telefrrik ,"It was nice, vip service is available so families can have privacy and enjoy. It is so cold, you should come with jackets"
Must see !,It’s an absolutely must see attraction. My word of advice to fellow travellers is that please DONT buy the fast track tickets at double the price. Unless it’s a very high season cues in normal ticket are not at all long + they let a family of four or six sit in a Cable car too. The attraction in it self is amazing and worth a look.
Bursa Teleferik ,I tried this ride during summer and it amazed me actually! Such a great and organized ride. The view is indescribable. A must to visit while in Turkey.
8km cable track,If you are familiar with cable track you have to ride this one. About 8 km for me the longest I have ever entered. Amazing view and at the end a nice place with Sone hotels and restaurants. Don’t forget to bring a jacket it can be chilly in the mountain
Great View,I went by this telefrik to Uludag mountain its amazing especially the view of city from teleferik and the car enter into the clouds.this experience you must try it i recommend this strongly.
Cheating Cashier,"I went today with my family to Bursa Teleferik, the cashier told me if I want to buy fast track ticket. I told him what’s the difference he said fast entrance and private car, when I entered there were no body waiting and the same car for everyone They just find away to let you pay more"
Great place to hangout,Come and enjoy the Teleferik during winter.. absolutely amazing. Ticket price is affordable and the place is good for family
A little expensive,Views so good..price a little expensive and always busy people waiting for use....need to extra service cabinet
Fantastic Ulüdağ,It's really unique telecabin with sharp incline and high distance from ground and between two columns.The nature and birds songs is spectacular. The view of city and Uludağ mountain is great.Of course the woods and chalets on the first station is wonderful. The foods on the first station are good but not so many choices through Ramadan.The Uludağ has still snows in the summer time but it's greatest ski resort in the winter time.
Oh,"Why is it much more expensive for foreigners?? It was not friendly. The view on the top of the mountain was not what I expected, it was just a forest with no amazing view from the top"
Great Experience ,"Bursa is a city in the northwest region of Turkey, lying in the foothills of roughly 2,500m-high Mount Uludağ near the Sea of Marmara. The city is known for its mosques and historical sites from the early Ottoman Empire. It's nicknamed ""Yeşil Bursa"" (Green Bursa) owing to its many parks and trees, as well as its dramatic mountain backdrop. You take the teleferik or cable ride to go up the mountain and see the entire city. At the top of mountain there are some souvenir shops but the best shop was where we got hot and spicy misir or corn."
Great view,"Riding this to Uludag and despite the scary and extreme route, the ride was very enjoyable and the view was great as well."
Very exciting experience ,Very nice place to visit better to spend a day or more to enjoy all the places and the snow on the mountain.
Snow in April,Wonderful views of Bursa from Mt Uludag. We got to see and play in snow in April! I recommend taking the ski lift to the top.
a beautiful place,"For many people who visit Turkey, making a stop in Bursa isn’t much of a consideration.  Nearby Īstanbul not only serves as the gateway to the country, but it ends up being a primary destination.  Most people do not make the easy, couple-hour trek south to Bursa, and those who do usually only make it a quick one- or two-day excursion.  Even some popular travel guides tell you that Bursa is only worth a quick day trip.I would strongly suggest otherwise.Though Īstanbul is certainly an enchanting city and there are a few essential things that all tourists should see and do there, I propose that Bursa actually makes a better destination to plant yourself for a few days and really explore and experience genuine Turkish culture.  So, once you’ve spent a day or so in Īstanbul gaping in amazement at Hagia Sophia, strolling across Galata Bridge, and eating fresh fish in a café overlooking the Bosphorus, get yourself straightaway on a fast ferry to Bursa and stay for a few days."
Absolutely Beautiful,One of the most scenic cable car rides in the world. We drove all the way to the top of Uludag mountain and took the teleferik down again. It was worth every penny spent. From the top it takes about 20 minutes down to the cable station but it's truly a sight to behold. The views from top are absolutely stunning in the winter time where mother nature shows off her assets by way of endless trees capped with snow and some river down on the forest floor. Make your way to the top and enjoy a steaming cup of turk kahvesi alongside the fire.
Worth it!,If the weather is good you should definitely go up the mountain with the Teleferik. Everything is very safe and the capsules are super clean. You have a few stops on the way if you have to go to the bathroom or if you want to buy a little snack. It is definitely worth it to go all the way up (2000m). We were lucky enough to see snow up there and it was quite the amazing view.
Closed due to weather,We didn't get to go much as it was closed because of weather conditions. It's extremely cold and chilled but it was beautiful. A little more maintenance can make it extremely amazing tourist spot
Cable ride with a view ,Efficient transport up to the ski lodge. We took the fast track ticket which cost TL100 per person. Due to the queue it was worth paying extra to beat the crowd.
amazing view,lovely when cold weather and amazing view you can see part of Bursa clean and Enjoyable nice view of kestena tree under the telefrik
Day trip to Uludag (Bursa) from Istanbul,"I had an awesome trip to Uludag using Teleferik Cable Car from Istanbul.I am sharing on how to make a day trip to Bursa / Uludag from Istanbul for the benefit of readers.While there are a number of transportation options for going to Bursa, using the ferry boat is a popular and cost effective mode.There are two ferry companies operating from Istanbul. IDO operates between Yenikapi (Istanbul) to Guzelali (Bursa). BUDO operates from Eminonu (Istanbul) to Mundanya (Bursa). Details are available on their respective websites.We (a family of four, including two young kids) took the BUDO to Bursa. The ticket counter is at the pier in Eminonu. If you book online, you can get promotional tickets at lower price. I tried doing that but somehow the transaction kept being unsuccessful. The ticket price is 30TL per person (adult / child above 5.5 years) one way. Once you get the ticket, you board the ferry that has two decks and a small cafeteria inside. I took the first ferry (0830 hours). The ferry ride took about 2 hours.Once at Mundanya port, you can go directly to the Teleferik station using bus F3. The bus is stationed right outside the BUDO pier at Mundanya. Ticket can be purchased from a small tuckshop located right next to the bus station for 6 TL per adult.The bus journey took 45 minutes. Once at Teleferik Station, you can get the tickets at the ticket counter. For 2 adults and 2 children, we paid TL 200 for the roundtrip (TL 60 for adults, TL 40 for child). The elevation of the mountain is 2500 meters, but the cable car length is 8.4 km. You can have a photo taken against a green background at the cable car boarding area, which will be later available for purchase for TL25 with a modified background of snowy area (3 options are provided).The cable car is safe and even is high crosswinds, the ride remained quite stable. Once you reach the intermediate station, you have to disembark and take another similar cable car to further go upto the mountain top. The intermediate station has a small market place, toilets and refreshment area where you can freshen up and purchase winter wear. As soon as you get off the cable car, some salesgirls approach you with your photo printed on a glass plate, available for TL80.The next cable car takes you to the mountain top, where there is another station that has a few restaurants and cafes. Toilets are also available, charged at 2 TL per visit. Winter jackets and ski equipment is available there on rental basis.After some sightseeing and enjoying in the snow, we took the return cable car at around 1400 hours and reached back at the Teleferik station just in time to catch the F3 bus parked at the station. Bus tickets are available at a few shops in the marketplace a few hundred meters from the bus stop.The return journey also took about 45 min. While at the BUDO pier in Mundanya, we bought the tickets from the counter and embarked the ferry at 1700 hours.It was a short trip to Uludag but thoroughly enjoyable and at the same time it was not too taxing on the kids.Hope this helps anyone looking to make a similar day trip to Bursa / Uludag via ferry."
Lovely Weather and Lovely Place,"wow what a trip that was... unforgettable, lovely and awesome time there with family, brothers and cousins."
"Beautiful scenery, smooth ride!",Really enjoyed our ride on the teleferik. İt doesnt swing and it was a smooth ride overall. Will go again!
Very Nice,"it was the longest teleferik in my life, it around 8 KM, 2km then safe stop, another 2km then a big area for entertainment and play around have a snack. then another 4 KM to another amazing area with amazing view.The view during the teleferik is lovely and unforgattable."
Pretty interesting,"It's clean and stable...I wasn't scared at all, even when I was going down after the sun went out and the electricity went out too for around 5 minutes lol but it was fun and marvellous nature viewing."
Was closed bcuz the wind never go with a tour company,Bursa it is the nice place in winter to see the snow but sometimes u just loose the whole days if u go with a tour people bxuz they stopped u so many places to buy things and they will get the commission . By the time u reached there it is almost no time to have fun..
"Tour trip from Sura Hagia Sophia Hotel Sultan Ahmed to Bursa, Uludag","Took a tour trip from Sura Hagia Sophia Hotel Sultan Ahmed to Bursa, Uludag.the fare was 170 tr, you can cheaper maybe (150 - 130)tr, but since it was from the concierge at the hotel it was very easy to deal with.started at 8:30 am, you should be prepared with a good warm clothes, or extra overcoat, the tour trip took a short cut through two tunnels, saved us more than 90 minutes of traveling including the ferry to Bursa at first. the trip had almost 9 stops, the old tree 610 years +, othmany coffee, honey farm, organic sales,  natural soaps, souvenir, Hulkum sweet factory, baklava, Yeshly Camii.came back at after 10:00 PM."
Longest cable car ,"One of the longest cable car rides in the world,try to go early and come before dark coz you will be going from Uludağ to bursa so try not to come back in the dark even though it does run"
Amazing experience,"I tried the Uludag Teleferik experience many times, and everytime it is an incredible nice and funny trip"
Summer visit,"It was a beautiful trip with family. We all enjoyed this trip. the ride was long and pleasant, there were two stops, where you find different types of shops, restaurants, and cafeterias. At the top of the mountain, we took a safari jeep, but was not that much.there was no snow because it was summer, however it is worth it at least to visit once with your loved ones."
Snow Sky Satisfied,"What a moment when u want to play snow or view scenery from above..Adult ticket 57 LTChildren ticket 45 LTThey have 4 station ( 1 main station, 2 is just for like pit stop u stop for a while, 3 station @1600M u must go out, 4 station 1800M when u want to ice skating )When u dont bring jacket, glove u can buy @station #3 like gloves is 20 LT so cheap.."
Wonderful ,"The charges is depending in which place to stop if you are going  to go down in uludag is more charging, in the top of the uludag alot of ice activities, cafe, restaurant, hotel. If you like ice activity you can rent the equipment for skiing."
Amazing,"This teleferic is amazing because it takes you to a 1820 meters high mountain specially during the snow time. You will see the trees covered with snow and you will go over the clouds. In the middle of the way, you can stop to do see many shops where you can do shopping and take hot drinks and sweets. After that you can enjoy the grilled meat and chicken in the restaurant located in the same place."
Magnificent ,"Good parking area,Ticketing time was adequate,I’ve used a lot of places teleferik establishments around the world Bursa T. is an exception in terms of there set-up and services provided and efficiency all were good ."
the best teleferik i have ever been,we were 4 friends and really it was a great adventure .. you will find a good place when you reach the top
Must do it,"Must do this activity in bursa, in teleferik you have a nice view to bursa and it is good to visit the uludag mountain but when we was there the teleferik have two part the second part who take you to the sky center it was stopped for maintenance"
Nice and long voyage,"Best way to reach Uludağ Mountain (hotels, ski pistes etc). Nice scenery except watching how the overgrown Bursa occupies once fertile plains. Good for families but nıt for trill seekers. Be sure to check wind before heading to Teleferik station."
Terrible security measures if many people enter the facility once,"We were supposed to go down the mountain using the teleferick on 29th dec 2017 evening around 6PM, due to rain and heavy snow too many people stormed the building at once. There was only 1 security guard who was unable to control the crowd, and he simply closed the doors and was opening the doors once in a while which made the people crazy and it was extremely lucky that no stampede took place. We were very scared with young kids as there was very real chance of stampede and injuries were possible.The security guy did not care about the families with kids and was unable to manage the situation, but he did not even call for back up. Overall we were very disappointed and scared of the teleferick service on that particular day. The authorities must do something to control the crowds in such situations if they want to avoid a major incident happening at his place (Specially the entrance building)"
Ski time with Turkish flavor ,uludag national park osmangaz in Bursa city is a wonderful spot for ski at reasonable cost. Teleferic is a fantastic mean of transport to ski spot. This teleferic facilities were newly installed with world standard quality. Ticket price is very reasonable. The area on top of Uludag mountain is beautiful and restaurant and good are fantastic
Long fun ride,"I liked how the view changes. When you start at around 230 m, there is no snow and not so cold. Up at 1860 m, it's covered with snow and quite cold. I recommend to take warm gloves and proper snow jackets and pants of you want to jet ski. Highly recommended."
The ride down the slopes,The 40-minute teleferic ride was 'the' longest and most exciting cable car ride I ever had. The view from above was spectacular!
Modern Teleferik,I went to the top of the Uludag mountain by the teleferik and it was so nice and comfortable...there are two stops...one at the middle where you can enjoy the fresh grilled meat and veggies and a cup of turkish çay or hot drinks in the snow or enjoy motor bikes drives...or simply enjoy the natura... At the station you’ll find everything you need from cafes to restaurants and craftsman shops to souvenirs and clothing shops....it’s a great place to enjoy
A good ride to the top ,Agood ride to the top of the mountain to ski or play with snow it costs about 40 tl for adult and 30 tl for kids above 6 years younger kids are for free ... the ticket is two way to go up and down the mountain it has two stops ... beware it might be closed incase of strong wind
Not to be missed,"The longest cable car in the world is definitely not to be missed. We took a private car from Sultanahmet to Bursa/Uludag as my son wanted to play with snow for the first time in his life. We departed early  at about 8 am and we reached Bursa about 3 hours later. I suggest earlier departure will shorten the travel time as you can avoid long traffic at the Asia bridge. We spent about 45 minutes at Bursa Bazaar and please buy Bursa souvenirs here. You wont find the same items in Istanbul. Bursa is also popular for its silk scarves. From the bazaar about 15 minutes drive up hill and we were on our way in the cable car. At early December, this is the only place nearest to Istanbul where you can enjoy snow and ski. Becareful tho, the prices for souvenirs etc are expensive at the cable car rest areas."
Must visit place if you visit Istanbul during winter,"There was to stops to reach the top mountain. The one way trip takes around 45 minutes. Everything is available there like snow clothes and equipment. But you have to bargain very well as they don't have fixed prices. Some prices are crazy compared to market price.Suggest to buy all you clothes from a mall or sports wear shops before going there.The hotels at the top mountain are closed until mid December ""where the season starts"".Ski bikes available for rent for 250 TL for 50 minutes ""you can negotiate"". The kids sliders available for 25 - 30 TL per hour.Overall was a great trip."
Magnificent view!,"Did a day trip from istanbul. Took a Budo ferry @830am from eminonu. Bought tickets a day earlier off Budo counter for 29Lira per pax. (One way) 2 hours ride. Once arrived, purchase bukart from the machine for 3.8lira and top up some amount to it. The yellow buses are right at the entrance so you cant miss it. Look out for 3/F for teleferik. 8lira for one way~ 45mins ride depending on traffic. (Fortunately at this timing there's no traffic) once at teleferik station purchase ticket from counter - 38Lira for a round trip. Unless you arrive early like we did (before 12pm) there will be a loooong queue to buy tix as well as to get on the cable cars. Worth waking up early to! You'll be blown away by the view! To return, you can take the same bus at the same point where you alighted ( please take note if you return after 3pm from here there will be traffic to get back to the pier- allow 1 and half hours for bus ride + waiting of bus arrival as they run on schedule."
very nice,it's very nice you will enjoy everything in it but you have to bring heavy jacket as it is 7 or 8 degree less than the normal.
Longest teleferic ever,"It's my 1st time to visit bursa. I heard a lot about this place and most people recommend  to visit this place. Most of them suggest to visit during winter time when thier is a snow but we visit the autumn  time and I would say it's the best ever. With the colour of the mountain, wow  just a big wow it's really heavenly beautiful. The colour of the trees if different like red orange yellow.. It's so colourful. With all those thrill when the cable car is going up and going down. Wow! Amazing. Personally I recommend to all not to misses bursa in your check list when visiting turkey"
Beautiful scenes,"We really enjoyed our telefrik ride, it offers an enjoyable forest scene, fresh air and a nice view of Bursa city , you can also enjoy the cafes and restaurants at the stops."
Amazing Experience ,More than 2500 meters at Uldag mountain you can enjoy the fresh breeze before riding the teleferik (cable cars) down between the trees
Beautiful View,"A lovely place on the mountain top in Bursa , get to see the whole city view and breathtaking snow covered mountains .The cable car ride is very safe . It was cold in May as well."
Pleasant and great value for money,"The Bursa Teleferik is one of the must do things in Bursa, the trip is so pleasant and you can see the scenery of the whole area from above. Also you will get the chance to stop at certain places where you can BBQ or use the buggies to explore the area and small shops and cafes are around the area as well."
"Beautiful natural Scenes, but long trip for almost the same View","It is not worth the visit during the summer, because you see the same evergreen trees along the trip, but I think during winter for snow activities it is worth to go up til Uldug. There is long ques to get up, so i don't recommend it in summer."
WOw,"An amazing activity to try during your stay in Bursa. We had a delicious lunch in that restaurant. Price is reasonable...I advise you to wear warm clothes, it's too cold in the mountains.Not good for people who have ear problems."
Main tourists attractions ,Of course Bursa Telefetik one of main tourists attractions in Bursa to see mountain Uldug slots to do for family with children's nice view to the city of bursa best to do meats barbecue rides motorcycle 4wheel waterfalls
Its Nice,"Ticket is 38 Lira, went there on 8th of Sep afternoon, wasn't much crowded. after first leg you have to change the car to go up more. weather on the way start changing and cold wind starts coming in the cabin. Better have some jacket or upper with you. There is nothing much you can do at the stations. some walk or visit few expensive restaurants or shops. They offer you your photoshopped picture frames at a pricey cost of 80 TL, bargained to 60TL or sooverall it was a nice experience"
Uludag Teleferik ,"Amazing place on top of Uludag mountain where you can enjoy the fresh air & beautiful stunning views. , Teleferik prices are reasonable , restaurants & restrooms available . Must visit . Enjoy . NK"
Breathtaking,This was an amazing ride amongst the clouds and tree tops. Truly a must do if you are visiting Bursa. There is a midway rest point before reaching the mountain top with the ski resorts. At this mid point is an amazing Kebab restaurant where you grill your own food on huge grills scattered along the restaurant. It was a magical snowy place.
Mind Bloawing,"This is the first thing one does when in Bursa. Summer or winter...We were in aw the entire ride up and down. And when you are on top of the mountain what you see is magnificent. If its crowded, look into the ""Fast Track"" option. Regular price is $10/person and double that for ""Fast Track""."
Amazing Nature Vew,"I visited this place in September,  but people recommend to go there during winters as you can do skiing.Best way to reach Teleferik station is to hop on ""F3"" (Bursa transport card required Fare:6TL) after getting out of ido station (F3 stop is near traffic lights). it takes you directly to teleferik. Other option include taking bus present in boundary of ido station to ""Emek metro station"" Take metro. Emek ---> Seherkustu (Fezvek cekmek road)---> 15A--> Teferruc.The round trip ticket price range from free to 38TL for different conditions. But a foreigner has to pay 38 TL for round trip. There are three station at different height. You can get off in second and third station at height of approx 1600m and 1810 m respectively. There are restaurant shops and toilets (toilet charges 2 TL in coins). You can do Bar B Q there.The view is breath taking and amazing and I highly recommend to go there if you are going to bursa"
Beautiful place ,"Worth it , only something I don't like and it happens in all Turkey which is forcing the passengers share one car cable with everybody I mean 10 passengers in a same car cable , I wish they understand that this trip all pay by  tourism to have enjoyable vacation not to make easy job for  those workers"
Relaxing worth every penny,"The road may be tiring if you go from Istanbul taking the ido from yenikapi ferry as early as possible to catch an early trip Where a taxi we preordered was waiting for us after a 2 hour trip.We went to many places which were regular like silk market or the bursa Bazzar ( same as Istanbul) then went to the teleferik regular ticket for 38 litra the whole round trip. Reaching a staggering 3400 m of fresh air and activities like ATV and hiking. The trip up was wonderful , trees surrounding the area .Best part was going back we stopped at the station went out and sat a restaurant in the woods where you can cook your own food and was delicious.Was an excellent get away from the Istanbul traffic."
Bursa ,It was a wonderful trip in bursa teleferik a lot of exciting had so much fun and the view was marvellous
Wonderful Ride to top of Bursa,"During our fourth visit to Bursa since 2012, we finally were able to ride the Telefrik. Our first visits were cancelled by high winds and the construction of the New Telefrik. It was a wonderful trip to the top. The trip is divided into two stages, each approximately 4.4 km in length. First stages (with an intermediate non-stop turning point) takes you from an elevation of approx. 250 m to approx. 1600 m, in 10 to 12 minutes ride. After reaching first stage, where most activities are available, you need to change the cabin to reach the second stage located a further 4.4 km away at elevation 1800 m. Uldag Peaks at 2,500 m at some distance away. The second stage is where hotels and ski resorts are located. It is worth to climb to the second stage in the summer as well, even though there is no skiing or snow. Overall, you need about 45 minutes to go up and 45 minutes to come down to allow for the long ques. This does not allow for the time you spend at both stations.Most activities are at the middle stage/station where there is small gift shops, coffee shops, food outlets, as well as several restaurants. Some restaurants where you can do your own grilling (restaurant provides the grill, flaming charcoal, your meat selections, plates and utensils). They can also grill for you at same price. The prices were reasonable and comparable to regular restaurants in the city. Other activities include renting of small RTVs and hiking."
Bursa Uludag,A must when in Istanbul and easy access from the city via ferry from port takes 2 hours to get to Bursa. Leave really morning and in March snow was still 1meter deep.
Should Do,Its a must go to attraction when in Bursa and make sure to go up all 3 stages.Once your up at the final stage youll know that it was worth every second in the cable car. Thw view is immaculate. I advise you to take the Fast Track ticket in order not to wait in line since its usually crowded & it costs 70TL total.As for the cafes & restaurant i tried the rest. in which there's a nargile and i do not advise eating there. The food was average & my nargile costed me more than my food it was a shock honestly.
Three stages to the top,"you have a three stages to the top, the first two are closed seats, but the third one is only for two seats and open.Be careful and do not be late, or you will not be able to catch the last ride back."
Breathtaking tour of Green Bursa and its magnificent Uludag Mountain,"One needs to take the Telefrik all the way to peak of the Uludag mountain. In usual hot day in downtown Bursa, it's very cool up there. On the top of the mountain, one can hike, do a picnic, ride  an ATV or simply relax in one of many cafes looking at the green mountains with a cup of tea or Turkish coffee."
The best of Bursa trip,"It was an excellent trip but you should consider the following:1- take with you jacket because the weather at the top not like the bottom.2- pay 20 lira and take the telesiyej which is open and not covered.3- don't go without a group, it will be big challenge for you to reach and return back.4- don't take group through the hotel the prices on the internet cheaper (40$ max)5- most of the group will take you to many shops for honey and turkish halava so there will be 2 to 3 shopping stops.Finally, enjoy your trip and it will be a fantastic trip for you and your family.telesiyej is not recommended for infants and kids."
Riding on the Teleferik Bursa in Turkey,"The trip up the Teleferik in Bursa was great. You need to be ready to get onto the car as it doesn't completely stop, but you do have lots of time to get on as it moves really slowly at the pick up and drop off points. The views are fantastic. You can get on and off at a couple of different levels and enjoy either snacks or meals."
Longest cable care trip that I have ever tried,It is one of the places that you should not miss when visiting Bursa. The round trip cost LT38 for the adult but really worth the long trip excitement.There is three stages that you go through to be at an elevation around 1800m. Be ready for the cold weather with proper dressing. It is highlly recommended to have your lunch on one of the resturant when you reach the top to enjoy it with the nice wither. My whole family really enjoyed it and found it as the best spot in Bursa
Great views,Bursa has its own charm must visit in summer for the view and the weather and in winter for the cold weather and ski activities
Long and beautiful,It's suggested to spend a day in Bursa Telleferik. The cabins are clean and the view is excellent. You can use public transportation from city to there. You can see the whole Bursa from the top. Don't miss it.
Was great,When we get up it was great to see the trees .. but only the shop their wasnt so good . And the price of the telefrik good it's 38 TL .
Adorable Bursa from the top ,"Nice tour trip must to spend in Bursa ,can't fed up from the top view of the magnificent nature in Bursa,all ages will enjoy it.there are 2  teleferik to ride .on the first ride stop of  you can take a souvenir picture it cost only 80 Turkish learah ."
Amazing Teleferik,It was one of the longest Telefferik I have ever climb in. It has three interchange to reach the top and each interchange stations has some attraction and entertainment facilities good for all family members
Beautiful Scenery,"My wife and I grabbed a Starbucks in the lobby and rode the tram to the first stop at the AVM and restaurants. The ride up was beautiful and the elevation made for a truly spectacular view. The price was a little more that we would have liked to spend, but wanting to get to the top and not wanting to deal with dolmuş' we opted for the Teleferik. Most days if it is not busy you get a private car with 360 degree views."
"Piremir Mahallesi, Teleferik Cd., 16360 Yıldırım/Bursa, Turkey","It's amazing place you can see the snow on the top of uldoge mountain, you can see the beers in the forest when you take a teleferik"
Will never forget the view,"The weather, the view of the very dense forest below our feet will never be forgotten. the top of the mountain is a must see location. Mount Uludag"
Fantastic Cable Car,It is the place where tourist come to see and enjoy Bursa Cable Car and weather. Place is extraordinary beautiful. I think it is world most longest Cable Car.
Wonderful ,A great opportunity to ride the world's largest cable car in Bursa. I enjoyed this experience very much and would like to repeat it again
Bursa Cable Car - Great Experinece,Bursa Cable Car ride was very exiting and full of thrill. It is a must do activity when in Bursa. It will lead you to the top of Uludog Mountain.
I enjoyed itl,Nice view and weather great barbecue the cafes are amazing you'll spend great time & you'll enjoy the romantic view ❤️
Nice and picturesque location,Its high on the mountain full of olive trees and other fruit trees. In winter it serves good for skiers and in summer its so beautiful to be here. The Teleferik offers mesmerizing top view of snow clad tops. The temperature here in June was like early winter - a light cardigan will serve handy. A great place to visit.
Amazing experience,"Highly recommended..even if you afraid of high places l, you will love it its very safe and you feel & touch the beauty of the nature.."
Beautiful Scenery,If you go to Bursa you got to take the Teleferik. Beautiful Scenery along your way up and you'll find many activities to do when you reach the top. Also there are many cafes and resturants to have lunch there.
Worth the time,"If you are on an excursion from Istanbul to Bursa, then Bursa Teleferik is definitely scheduled on your trip. The green scenery while descending the teleferik was amazing. It's cold in May though, so be prepared with a jacket and do taste the buttered corn at the entrance of the teleferik as it's hot and yummy. Have fun!"
Enjoy the mountain..,If you are in Bursa you must go up Uludag. Enjoy the view of Bursa from the cable car. Enjoy the cold weather on the mountain. Bring your jacket. Even if it's hot in Bursa but up on the mountain it will be cold. During winter people go for skiing.
Nice time,Interesting to see. In good weather there is spectacular view. Probably is will very in the winter. It is a must in Bursa.
Mist visit,"This place is really nice destination, if you are coming from Istanbul, it would take you about 3 Hours."
Exceptional day,Amazing trip and you should try the teleferik nice view from the  top of the mountain also there is a cafe shop in the top you can sit there and enjoy the turkish black tea.
"Been charged for 2 stops,got only one!","Well the view is absolutely amazing,more beautiful than Tbilisi and batumi cable car, BUT! They charge you for 38 tl for a return ticket for 2stops without telling us the second one is not working,for 2weeks! when we got to the first stop, and asked where we can change cable cars,they told us it is closed 😐!!1important thing is that don't be fooled by bursa weather,it is very hot in the city, but uludag is really cold,and if you don't bring coats,you gonna have to buy one!"
Nice experience ,It was a nice experience to try Bursa Teleferik. The view was amazing. The service in the two stop stations are good and you can find all your needs. Recommended to try it when you visit Bursa.
A life time experience,Make sure your camera is ready to go because every second there is going to be a new scene. Simply breath-taking.
Don't miss this Area ,I am traveling with family and we visit this place every time when are coming to turkey really it is so koool and so lovely to visit this area between December and April for who love the coldness this teleferik have two stop before you reach the top and don't miss to use the bus at the top to go the nearest point for uldug mountain to enjoy to climb the open another teleferik for jumping with skeet on the ice and also they have a good restaurant up with caribou coffee shop
Don't miss photo session with photo unicorn,"Hi, the teleferik trip was so great! And what made the trip even better and memorable was amazing photos taken by photounicorn photography. They gave me a great service with such generosity and kindness.you will find their talented photographers as soon as you step out of the last station. They took perfect photos with great backgrounds for almost nothing.( reasonable price)They gave me a print copy of my photos and sent HD copies to my email and my WhatsApp. I even contacted them the next day to buy more photos but the gave me extra photo for free and refused to accept money :) .Sevgi ( manager) was so kind and the photographer Erin was so talented.They made that trip unforgettable with their special treatment!"
Great pure oxygen of UlU Dag,"The (Ulu dag ) means the great mountain Where the teleferik (cable car )  will take To the hight of 1800 meter , you can reach by car also Where you will find a lot of activities (skate , 4x4 car drive on the snow ,Atv ride , meat barbecue And a lot of photo taking You can spend the the day with a good views and great Oxygen There is some hotels there if you want to spend the night there"
Bursa city trip,"The place is so nice , the service is good and the city has much to see.Before reaching the top hill to the teleferik you can pass by the organic honey shop and to the Jam store where they sell natural soaps and facial products.The cost of the Teleferik is 30 TL (6 € approx)"
Perfect 👌🏼 ,"Nice place ,, and the best view I seen It's a calming and fun place And there's altos activity on their"
Nice.....,"Will organized and clean, and you can see the entire mountain from within. It case around 30 minutes to reach from one side to the other one"
Good ski place,Teleferik takes us to high mountain suitable for ski and surely I liked it.The teleferik is more than 8 km long and one need to change a little above half way
Amazing Place,I take 2 ticket about 75 Turkish lera ..is amazing place and I will come again .. you can see white color every where and the sun is amazing
Ski holiday ,"We took taxi to Uludag mountain from bursa when we're in the hotel we found out that there is a cable car to bursa it was a great experience trees all around snow every where, must try when you visit bursa"
Good experience ,Good experience and much cooler place than city all year long. Breath taking view to the city. Excellent grilled food. Over priced services once you reach to the top.
GOOD PLACE YOU HAVE TO SEE!,"It is Bursa, Turkey!It is very good place you have to see!It is beautiful in summer as well as in winter!"
fantastic,a very amazing experience that all tourists should do. you will see amazing view from above and also there are cafes
Intresting,U can take all day bursa trip.we wnet there from istanbul.the bus will take you in a 3-4 hrs trip..the bus will ride into the ferry to bypass about 60 km from the road..bursa is a very beautiful and busy city..I advice a minimum of 2 days trip to bursa.When we reach bursa we went to the mountain for lunch..the road in the mountains wil make you super dizzy and nauseated..but when.u reach the resturants there they have a good idea of letting you bbq the raw meat they give you then we went for the top of the mountain and took a very nice ride in the telefrique till the bottom of the mountain.it will take about 40 min ride in a glassy telefrique across the beautiful green Forrest.in general it is a very nice trip but it is usually visisted in the winter time in the presence of snowInstagram : dr_alihaydar
Reaching new heights in Turkey,"This underestimated tourist attraction in Bursa, Turkey is definitely worth the effort. We walked up through the city before getting a taxi up the steepest part to the Telefonik. Although it was a local holiday we didn't have to queue for long to purchase our tickets. The whole experience was amazing. We were blessed with great weather conditions for the time of year.  We treated ourselves to lunch from one of the many cafes at the top before walking about for a bit. If you have the time the snow mobiles look like great fun but we didn't have time!"
Visiting Uldag,It was first time for me to using Bursa teleferik in winter. I enjoyed every moment their. Quite and good city to stay in. I recommended people to visit teleferik.
The trip to bursa,"It's not the trlefrek, it's about the trip to bursa. From Istanbul to bursa you need two to three hours in private car.The snow is very nice, the price is resonable but little advice.The driver takes you to his friends' shops, make it worse, you reach the snow at 4 while 7 is totally dark.To motorcile is a big lie, the staff of jets are not telling straight word. Avoid them.Take the other telefrek, very nice calm fun place ,  you have to pay 20 and 3 for the bus.While going back no restaurant at all, only mac after 15 min.So eat well, or stay hungry all the way back"
Wonderful views,Took the telefrik all the way up to Ulodag Mountains.. The scenery is just wonderful. The trip going up took about 45 mins and if you are scared of heights then this is not for you! Otherwise dont miss this activity.
Kesinlikle kullanmayin / do not use,"Do not use the teleferik. Tour guides bring touriat to the Bursa teleferik, but it is nothing else than a way to lure tourists and groups inside to the shops with prices  which are more than 100% of the normale rate. And the personel is very rude. When waiting in line for the cable carts there is a photographer who obliges everyone to take pictures. Even if you do not want to!!! Very very very rude. And all because they want to profit from tourists."
Amazing views,"At first I thought 38tl was a little expensive until I got on and realised it takes you 8km and climbs nearly 2000 meters. We were lucky and had a very clear day, the views are stunning. At the top we had a coffee and watched people try and ski! Would definitely recommend it!"
You have to visit ,This is an amazing opportunity to go to the top of the mountain Uludag with teleferik you don't have to miss this amazing
Amazing place with lots of fun,"Perfect trip, wonderful view and lots of fun, it was my second time to visit bursa, the first time was during summer and this one was at Jan. and I've to admit. Winter is way better and much fun. snow wars, view is legendary and many activities to do during the trip. Don't forget to eat at ""Abo Shanab"" restaurant where you can grill the meat by yourself."
I like it ,"I had visited twice (summer, winter) l loved it in winter more than summer season, it was amazing, clean, no damages or risks, security system was very tough and safe. It was crowded a little bit but it was arranger."
Wonderful view ,This type of places in this season is must see.People there are very friendly and helpful.Wonderful view everywhere.
Be on the top and enjoy.,- teleferik will take you to the top of the mountain where you can reach the area hotels and ski sports .- you will see all Bursa city from the top and enjoy the view of the wood .
Best day outing in Bursa,"We took a dolmus from our hotel and it cost 2,50TL a person ( close to the big mall ) we climbed out right at the cable car. Tickets cost 35TL a person. The cable car takes a total of 25 minutes to reach the top, half way up you get out and walk through a small shopping complex you also go outside and can go on one of the snow mobile rides at 200 TL a person. Lovely hotels and photo opportunity walking in the trees. You then catch the second part of the ride up to the top, there are a total of 140 cars that arrive every 19 seconds, the cable car transports a total of 1500 people per hour. Each car holds 8 people. At the top you can walk through some more shops, have a coffee ( 10tl ) or salep. The Bof hotel is amazing ( African decor ) with a big fireplace inside and wifi. Going gown you take the same route and when you get out at the bottom you can purchase pictures thru have taken of you or have a quick Starbucks"
Bursa Teleferik during December,We went from Istanbul to Bursa which took us around 4 hours.While it took us around 25 minutes to use the Teleferik to reach the top of the mountain.  The place was good for youth and children to experience the snow and to see the view from there.
Only on a clear day,"The view is really great, but you need a clear sky for that. Otherwise, the upper station is somehow far from the sky slopes and hotels, so a car would provide more flexibility."
Must on bursa,It is something that you have to do it if you visit bursa. The view from the teleferik you will never forget it!
A MUST visit for history lovers,"I love Bursa. Tis where the Ottoman Empire was first established. It's a MUST destination for all especially history lovers. It's the Europe  end of the infamous Old Silk Road that stretches right up to Xian in China.From Istanbul, it's a wonderful 2-hour journey by road  and ferry across a beautiful lake. The city is up on a hill with stunning viewds of the surrounding areas. Lots of historical remains especially on the history of the Ottoman empire. The market is best. This was where tired  travellers rest after their very long journey along the Silk Road. You can still find the water fountains where they quench their thirst and the mousalla to pray."
never miss,"A MUST go to. Also when you reach the last stop, go to the viewpoint, wonderful views!! if you won't bother walking, then walk it to the viewpoint (4 KMs) but there are amazing views along the way with a spacious forest along the way, also prayed in the wonderful mosque in the way to the viewpoint, loved everything about Bursa."
Nice views.,"I had the opportunity of traveling on this Telefrik from the base of Uldug mountain to Bursa. The ride takes about half an hour and is in two stages, so almost half way through you have to get off and hop on to another cable car. The cable cars are clean and as they are mostly constructed of glass, you can have very nice view of the surroundings. This is world's longest Gandola ride. When I took the trip there was dense fog during part of the travel. At the base they have nice restaurants and coffe shops. I forgot to mention that the cable cars are totally covered to keep the elements away. You get panaromic view of the Bursa town. Anyway it is a nice way to spend some time if you happen to be in or near Bursa."
Amazing Trip,"Very good experience , it was really fun , great atmosphere and fresh air up there .I advise all to try this Telefrik and enjoy with perfect sight and view ."
"Nice ride the first time, boring the second","Don't worry if the cabin stops for a minute... I can see why people insisted on taking the teleferik but I also understand the underwhelming reviews. I definitely recommend it on a nice sunny day with no clouds or smokes, or after the sunset. But you didn't miss anything if you went up the mountain by car."
Spectacular view to remember,"This is our second time visit to Uludag. We came back to complete the journey of the longest cableway of the world.We had great time and enjoyed the view throughout the ride. Be it either spring or autumn, you will experienced the beautiful journey to the peak."
Must try it,"Anyone who visits this side of Turkey should definitely take the time to try this, it has amazing views and great atmosphere, especially if you're visiting in the winter, you would have the chance to ski."
"Amazing views, great adventure",My wife and I actually got engaged on the Teleferik:)  we shared the cabin with some German tourists and became good friends.  Great opportunities for photos!
amazing trip,"it was great trip in the sky of bursa to the top of mountain where you touch the clouds, see bursa from there in colorful view"
Must Try When Going to Turkey,"It was a wonderful day in the middle of September the weather was helping shiny and a little bit windy the teleferik journey was awesome it took maybe 15 or 20 minutes to reach the Uludag mountain. The place up there was amazing but since we were with a tour we didn't have much time to spend so I think we missed a lot of fun an nature great seeings, my advice for you and for me the next time I'm going there I will stay in Bursa at least for 2 days because there's a lot to do there. The teleferik to the Mountain, the City center,  the Zoo and much more."
Amazing - we love it,"It was lovely experience, we decide to have food on the top of mountain using Telefrik, but it was very rainy day we could not had the food as planned, but it was amazing experience Telefrik with rain, wow wow wow, However the Telefrik experience regardless the weather condition is just amazing and must give a try"
breathtaking experience ,don't miss this experience... i advice you to enjoy this trip and the Adrenaline rush.  the distance from downstairs to up is 20 to 25 minutes .
TELEFRIK! Awesomness in the air,"It was GREAT and BREATHTAKING experience!!! We had a lot of fun in a 8 places room , the up-trip takes long minutes and the view is wonderful up in the hills and a great overall view of Bursa city from the left side . A MUST DO in BURSA !!!!"
Multistory Teleferik ,My first Teleferik ride. I was so excited.It's really nice. In the summer you see green everywhere. As you go down the old bursa city appears in a spectacular view.Nice place to take photos. It's really long ride but enjoyable. You will not feel the time.Ticket was 25 TL. Cheap
Nice visit - incredible view,Very good experience. We visited Bursa Teleferik with friends and it was really fun. From the top the view is astonishing. I recommend it to all visitors.
A must visit attraction in bursa,"its a nice way to see all the city from the top, we been a part of group traveling together and was recommended to us to take one day trip from istanbul to Bursa, our guide took us early morning and the only reason we tok this trip was because of the telefrek-cabel carit was for me and my family and that was the highlight of our turkey trip to book telefrek tourthe mountain on the top was very cool and lovely windy recommended and kids would love it"
Nice attraction,It was a nice attraction.I was there last week and enjoyed every moment.I recommend you to have a lunch in the restaurant there too.The scene is wonderful and very nice nature around.
Loved it,Its very nice  the view is breathtaking... Loved it eventhough i am clostrophobic and was very scared
Amazing ,"At 1st i was scared with the teleferik, because its very high and I'm afraid with the heights. But to my surprise i overcome it.. It was amazing.."
Each time new thing,"Nice place with new station. Every time new thing to do. The wether is always cool, the nature always blooming. You could enjoy the ATV ride or bicycle ride for kids.it is a very natural place for a hike or just a walk. The new winter cabinets are wonderfully done. It is a magnificent combination out there. Of course you could find the traditional got shops and Turkish delights."
The best vacation,"Really i advise everyone to visit this very beautiful city. Really I enjoyed everything especially Bursa teleferik, the flying chair. It is really cold on the top of the mountain but I and my family enjoyed it.."
Loved the place,"It's a very good place to enjoy, The place was awesome, I prefer to visit in winter so that all the place will be covered by Ice"
EXCELLENT VIEW AND EXPERIENCE,The service is payable @TL 35/ adult for a return ticket. The view is excellent for the whole town of BURSA fro the highest point. You can view the woods and running water underneath. The teleferik cabin can easily accommodate a family or a group of six adults.
Great panaromic view of the city thru the cable car,"For a stunning panoramik view of the City, you have to take the cable car to the top of the mountain Uludağ. You will enjoy the view over the forests on the way. A must see attraction for Bursa all itineraries."
the world's longest gondola lift line,"It was one of my hopes to ride this Gondola lift line locally called (Teleferik) you'll never regret to ride it, the view is amazing you'll feel that you are at the top of the world, if you plan to go by the summer time make sure to choose a non cloudy day, i'm serious even a partial clouds could be a problem as far as blocking the views so make sure it's sunny before you plane the visit. if you want to go by the winter time you should know it might be close because of the high wind. but anyway it's totally worth the spending."
Lovely trip at the sky,"Nice and lovely long trip at the sky,  not fo people with heart problems or those who fear of heights."
A day over the cloud - Uldog Mountain.,"We took a taxi to the Teleferik station; There was no line, we paid by credit card TL 35 per ticket - which get you the ride till the last station (Hotel station).We stopped at Saralin - where we had our lunch. there are shops right after you get out of the telephric. You have to bargain because everything they sell expensive. You need one lira to enter the WC !!!  For dinning, we tried the restaurant located above the telefrik; food was not good, very expensive ; probably they are selling the view more than food so just avoid it and go to the other restaurant where you grill for yourself."
Amazing views and great experience ,"If you are gonna do 1 thing in Bursa, this is it. The way up to the mountain is a great experience, with beautiful views of the surrounding. We went there 1 hour before closing so we only went straight up to the top and back, and it was still worth the price. It is very romantic and cosy to go at night because it gets really dark and beautiful, but if you want to have the great views all the way, I say go before dark."
Nice mountain experience,Great atmosphere and fresh air up there. It costs around 10 euro but it's totally worth it. There are many beautiful landscapes and clouds which you can admire.
Not to be Missed,Do not miss this. The cost is 35tl for a return ticket and is well worth it. The views are amazing and there are restaurants at each of the stages. To go to the very top takes 45mins but there is currently a stop about 2/3rds of the way up. They were building another stop when we went up. You need to change cars at the 2/3 stop but it is all included in the ticket price. If you come to Bursa then this is a must!
Nice Trip,"After arriving Bursa, stopped at Munira Lukum Delight to buy Turkish sweets. Then used cable car or Telefrik to go up to the mountain. About 20 minutes one way. Amazing picture from the top. This place is called mother in law valley. It means if anyone hate his in law, just take her to this place and drop her from the top. Just joking"
Great experience!,"Bursa Teleferik has been improved greatly in the last years! We went up Uludag Mointain with three 10 year olds, everything went smoothly. Once you get there I strongly recommend having lunch at the restaurant managed by Osmangazi Belediye. They sell meat products by weight and bring you a grill so you can grill and eat. The service was perfect!"
Great place to visit,Visited in the winter with family and had a great experience of the winter cold.Very clean and ready to help people around the shopping areas. The Syrian restaurant at the Base outside is a must visit.
Nice trip ,"I advise all to try this Telefrik and enjoy with perfect sight and view  , it,s amazing you will see all the cith under you and then go to mountain where you will see resturant you need to eat and have fun ."
very nice views and there are 2 destiations,very good nice views of places parking available nice to go with family and friends  good price and place
great experience,"great experience fun for the whole family.  Was nice, modern, clean & very well organized.  We arrived at the top of the mountain after enjoying the breath taking view along the ride & had self-BBQ in the 1st restaurant up there.  Food was great & the Turkish tea was amazing.  It's worth the trip up there"
Cannot Fault It,This cable car starts in Yildirim in the centre of Bursa. There are modern well managed facilities. It costs 35tl for an adult and 25tl for a child. We had a car to ourselves. You get fantastic views up Mount Uludag and back down towards Bursa. There is a middle staging area where you have to change cars to get up the main ski resort. There are some really nice restaurants and others being built at the middle staging area. They have built log cabins at the middle staging areas which I presume are to rent. Whether you get of at the top or middle you are able to walk into the forests and utilise one of the many picnic areas. Well worth visiting. It takes nearly one hour from top to bottom. Really nice day trip.
Best of the best ,We took a bus from a station near to ulu cami mosque. The place was very nice and the ticket price was 20 lira for round trip. There was two stops on this teleferik.....One was a open park with lots of greenery and beautiful shops of souvenirs and sweet inside. And last stop was at the top. There was a supermarket which offers a nice coffee.
Stunning,The height of the mountain is 2200 meters. The view from top is stunning and beautiful. And when you reach the top you will freeez from the cold weather so you better wear sonething heavy. The time in the telefrik is around 20 minutes but its worth to spend the time. Loved it
Best of the outdoors ,Well I think Teleferik is the best outdoor think to visit in Bursa I suggest if you are staying in Bursa you must go Enjoy it
Enjoy the snowing in summar,In the summer most of the Gulf heading to Bursa to enjoy the snow my job was to take them to the tourist areas they liked the view of the snow .
The world longest gondola lift ,"Two lines, one followed by the other, take you from Bursa up to the ski resort at the base of Uludag mountain. The total ride time takes approximately 30 minutes, providing great panoramic views along the way. Be aware that it might be much colder at the upper station, so take some warmer clothes with you."
Bursa teleferik,"i went to bursa 22nd April 2016 , was amazing weather and enviroment as well,and the experince of the teleferik was really nice and enjoyable .love BURSA"
Amazing ,It is an amazing experience to ride a cable car from 2000 meters height downward with a very nice views of the mountains. Really it deserves to be done
Way to Olympus,This cable car is climbing to the real Olympus mountain. It has recently been renovated and big cars are changed with small ones. I strongly recommend you climb at least to the Sarialan. You may have a nice walk in this area and take inside super fresh air.If it is not winter no need to climb till the end.
Bursa,"A place to be, extra ordinary view, best time to visit is during the winter if you want to experience snow, a lot winter games to engage in"
Amazing experience,"30 min of amazing views,snow covered mountains and valleys , very romantic and exciting. There are 2 or 3 stops where you can shop take someTea or coffee and continue you trip. At winter its very cold so be careful.Definitely i recommend"
Day trip ,A must see when visiting Istanbul. Quad biking on the mountain with snow. Open cable car rides.  Amazing view. Beautiful scenery.  Nature at its best.  (Be wary of the photographers that follow you on the quad trail as their prices are very high per photograph.)
rise sitting,"very enjoyable to get so very high seeing every huge buildings getting small under you while you are just hanged on the air :).I loved being in the Teleferik, and seeing the snow.Not all areas giving the right to skiing, but there is some hotels giving by rent.in my way back while I'm in the air I saw some people riding buggy in the forest, but for sorry I was alone to ride it .and wasn't know where to rent from.be with a company is very nice go enjoy many things there.but I enjoyed it very well in the teleferik as it is not a short tour :)to buy from the market in the station up, better negotiate as much as you can"
Safe and sound,"A safe and hi-tech system which takes you up and down safely and comfortably. Velocity is ideal and cabinets are spacious, 4 to 6 people could fit in."
Honey moon,"It is an amazing experience, comfortable hotel with great facilities. It was snowing but not that cold, i took lessons in skiing and went to top of the mountain, took sime rides, and finally enjoyed the food."
Nice,It's new nice place needs more shops and places for sitting ...maybe a playground for the children.
Fantastic!,"Must visit place in Bursa! Please plan a whole day. Teleferik makes 2 stops - and it is nice to have a long walk on both places. Nature is amazing. No need to take food or water with you, there are nice cafes on both stops. But warm cloth is a must take. Round-ticket price is 30 Turkish Liras."
Excellent experience,We went as family to the top of the mountain in bursa .we used two Telferiks  in order to reach the top of the mountin .i t really great and had a lot of snow my kids enjoyed the snow .also a lot of cafe there and small restaurants .the experience is worth to go and see .the fees for Teleferik is cheap 35 TL which is around 10$ .i highly recommend to spend a day in there mountain .
Experiencing Nature,"If you are in Bursa in the winter, you shouldn't miss Uludag. The cable car will take you to the mountain. There are 2 arriving points. The top of first one is flat area and not for skiing. If you want to ski, you need to go to the seond one where there are hotels. You can hire equipment and an instructor. If you go to in the spring or summer it is ideal for hiking and picnics. If you are from abroad and want to hike, do not forget to let the security forces know as you may get lost and they can help you any time. Do not forget that the hotels and the food is not cheap! This place is very popular with locals and also Arab tourists."
Great view & lovely experience,One of the best places we visited. Must try & they take good photos with the snow. Pictures with Turkish outfits for the whole family too.
Nice experience,"its nice Experience I tried even I hate high places, but in the end there is alot of barbecue restaurant that you can cool dawn and relax"
Eye candy galore ,"If you are staying in Bursa city centre look out for bus with 'teleferik' written on electronic screen and timetable available at most bus stops. On arrival pay a small fee of 35tl which is well worth it. The cable car itself is clean and spacious, can accommodate up to 8 people sitting. The ride up is slow with lovely city views.You stop at first station where you can get off or continue further up to ski centre. At first station is numerous restaurants and self buy meat and barbecue restaurant which I found super awesome. The second ride takes you upto hotels and ski centre where one can hire equipment and have some serious fun. Please note they do have closing times depending on weather and if you arrive late just before closing time it's very very congested. Wear appropriate clothing and shoes for snow as it's not easy to walk and one can get seriously injured.Enjoy"
Nice view,I enjoyed my ride in this teleferik. Nice view of Bursa from it. A bit scary but enjoyable. Nice way to go up to the mountain or coming back down.
Great views,"Amazing views from above, enjoy the long peaceful ride. If you don't like to ride with strangers, try to make sure that you are 6 to 8 persons together. Late afternoon rides are the best. At the last station you may enjoy some food kiosks and souvenir shops, and don't forget to bargain ;) Get a good cam, the pictures are amazing from above."
Magical ,This place is magical! An unforgettable experience.. A must do when you're in turkey! Try to reach the second destination early so you can ski at the top of the mountain. Go it by yourself you wont need a tour guide or anything...
Normal telegenic,Nothing special it is like any old telegenic in world The taxi drivers like it because they will save gasolineIf you use it moving in the mountain will not be easy
It was a nice ride,It was a nice ride from the top of the mountain back to Bursa city.We had a nice vieuw and enjoyed the diverence from snow to green whitin 45 minutes.
Incredible experience ,"I have an acrophobia but it was so amazing and enjoyable! speed of the telpher was slow but height of uludag was frightening! 😲 but you can trust me, the telphers are safety😉 the weather was freezing , put on thick clothes in winter!"
Amazing,I went there in winter so it was really cold for people who don't like cold don't go there but i do so i went there with my family we really had fun playing with snow and we ate at a very good resteraunt that one in the picture
nice experience,"we had a really good time watching the view on top, the price is quite reasonable and the safety is being taken care of quite well. must experience it if you ever in bursa."
perfect,"perfect if you wants to go bursa,you yave to visit teleferic,if you want to need a guide fatih is perfect,etihad tur..."
"Must do, must visit",Bursa was the only other city that I went to apart from Istanbul during my year end visit in 2014. We went up the peak and continued being driven in a van to go up to the peak to enjoy the snowy mountains. One of the things that you may want to do once you reach the station on top is to just drop by one of the restaurants offering grilled meat called Palabiyik Et Mangal. The entire experience was priceless.
Good visit,All places which we visited are nice to the family You have every thing available The children will enjoy there I will plan for another visit
Nice views,"We went on December 17th .We took the  Bursa Teleferik on our way down ,the cost was included in our tour price .Nice views,safe."
A must see in Bursa,"It's very quick and convenient, to leave the city center and find yourself above a mountain in just 30 minutes."
Must try! ,"You must try the ride. It is an easy ride with great views. It's very picturesque.  The stations are not completely finished, still under construction. However it would not affect your journey. Return journey cost 30tl. You could stop at Sarialan and have a wonder around, beautiful walks at around the forest. There are places to eat and drink. You can bring your own and even have a BBQ. There are places you can hire a snow mobil etc. Then take the second ride and go to Mount Uludag. There is a short walk to the ski resorts or you can take the minibus which is very cheap (2.25tl). So it can be a lovely day out for all family. Highly recommended."
Excellent place you must visit,"Very nice place, specially in winter. Make sure you are ready for cold weather. You must plan to visit"
Teleferik is just terrific!,The ride was very comfortable and save a lot of time. We enjoyed the amazing scenery and the fresh air of Uludag mountains.
Breathetaking adventure !!,"I have been there in september 2014...the place is worth the visit The scene from inside the telefrik is stunning so you can see the greeny forest and trees undrneath you  When reaching the top of the hill by telefrik , you could have a nice turkish lunch there ..."
A great and fun way of transportation between Bursa and Uludağ.,"Travelling through a cable car for 20 minutes over stunning view of the snowy wood and overlooking the city of Bursa from high above, is just a wonderful experience."
Scenic ,Quite beautiful and one of the few touristy things to do in Bursa.Went up at 4pm down at 5pm.30 Lira (about $10) to go up the gondola and back down.  Had hot snacks when we arrived at the top as it naturally gets colder at the top of the mountain.
