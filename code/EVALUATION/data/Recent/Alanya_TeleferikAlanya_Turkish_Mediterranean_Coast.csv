Beautiful views,"We went both directions on the cable cars as part of a tourist day trip up to the citedal! Masks are wore, temperature checks are completed, hand gel provided and the car are deep cleaned after each use. The views are amazing. Fully enjoyed the views and the cable cars."
Living the High Life,"Large cable cars take you to the top of the castle area for you to explore.  Whether you go in the day or the night the views are amazing.  Even if you‚Äôre scared of heights, this is worth being brave for. (My husbands legs are healing well from the nails I left in them)."
Great veiw,"This little cable car is a great viewing point, but that is all it is good for, take a few pics, have a drink, and that is it."
Great views,"Only costs around ¬£4 to go up in the cable car and you get great views from the top, it's definitely worth a visit!"
Love it...,"The cable car is great. The best way to climb the fortress. When my husband and I went, a return ticket cost 33tl per person. The view is beautiful, going above Cleopatra's beach, which can be seen along its entire length. There is enough time to look around and take photos. The cable car works constantly and a new gondola arrives every 1-2 minutes. They disinfect every year and it is necessary to wear masks. The gondola can hold more people, but they only let groups in. My husband and I were alone in the gondola, and a family of 5 members entered the gondola before us. The cable car is located at the beginning of Cleopatra Beach and the entrance is right next to Guzelyali Street which runs parallel to K. Beach."
Really good value for the trip and amazing views!,This was the best thing I did in Alanya. It's so cheap to get a return ticket and the views at the top are incredible. There's also some nice little drinks kiosks and jewellery stalls at the top. Totally worth it!
Lovely views ,"We enjoyed our trip on the cable cars,  very hot day when we visited so we didn't walk all the way to castle,  and probably not best in flip flops!"
Too short! :),"After having spent the day on Cleopatra beach and visited the Damlatas cave, my fiancee and I went for the Teleferik. What can I say, we enjoyed it, didn't know which way to look first :D Lovely ride, alas too short :)"
Flying High in Alanya,Ours was a return trip and well worth the 33TL the views of Kleopatra and the town were brilliant. Each car was cleaned after each trip
Great view!,It was a great experience for me! Last time when I have been here it was not here so it was quite nice to see it. The price is ok but its already fast going so you have no much time to take nice photos :) I advice you to try this!
Amazing views,This is a must for anyone visiting the area. Aim to go before sunset this way you‚Äôll get day and night photos. Incredible views. Very cheap at 33 Tl for a return trip.
ü§©,"Wonderful experience, recommend that you take the cable cars to Alanya castle in time to watch the sunset, the view is simply breathtaking! The queue was long at that time but luckily it moves fast. It cost a total of 136TL for our group of 4 to go up to the castle and for return at any time (before 11pm)."
Good view of cleopatra beach,Good view of cleopatra beach. High cable lasted few minutes. 33 lira per person adult child same price
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE,"Fantastic views, reasonably priced, extremely C-19 aware and staff take customer health and safety very seriously e.g. fumigating each car after use. Fabulous views on the cars at at the top [near the castle]. Lots of resting places once alighted from the cars and en route to the castle.I would go back in a heartbeat."
What a great experience!,"Fast,efficient and great value! Definitely the best way to explore the castle.We went in the day but they operate at night too."
Great attraction. ,"We visited the cable cars as a family. Due to covid we had to wear a mask and the cable car was de fumigated before we got in. We felt very safe. The journey to the top is about 7 minutes and you have brilliant views along the coastline. We decided to venture up at sunset and it was lovely and not too hot at this time. At the top, there are wooden walkways and steps up to the castle. I would recommend NOT to take a pram up as the steps are steep and the walkways are narrow. The views from the top are sensational. There is a little market as you walk further round and a lovely looking restaurant with reasonable prices! If we had had more time, we would‚Äôve loved to explore more. Definitely worth a visit. Another place for amazing views is ‚ÄúThe Rabbit‚Äù which is at the other side of Alanya but is beautiful and so high up in the hills. It has an outdoor theatre up there (obviously wasn‚Äôt on due to covid) but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit."
Alanya teleferic ride - tourist attraction,"I gave 4 points/stars to this attraction only because this teleferic is just for tourists to experience the ride and enjoy the amazing view. When i went there, the price was 5 euros, return ticket but if you go one way the price was aprox 4 euros per person So it is great if you only want to ride it once and experience the ride but if you happen to love visiting the castle and the top of the hill, its better to take a taxi and 4 people can go to the top for less than 5 eur.So if you are local with lower income, teleferic might not be your first choice of transportation to the top of the hil.The teleferic is in great condition, and people who work there are lovely."
Death trap,This place is a death trap. My 7 year old daughter fell through the plank of wood that was laid out as walk way through the building site that was up the top of the castle.It is a disgrace. DONT GO to Alanya castle.
Amazing,"This place is out of this world, what an amazing experience. There are unbelievable views from every corner. Very safe and easy to go up with young children, there's high railings around the large steps, and resting areas at every few step. The Castle, the old homes, the cemetery, the tea house at the top of the hill will take your breath away. Pure magical experience."
Great Views,Lovely views as you go up. Inexpensive at 28l. At this time of year there were very few visitors so everyone gets a car to themselves. Leave a couple of hours to look around the castle when you reach the top.
Beautiful views .,"We visited with our children, tickets were 15.TL per person and under 5 were free. Cheaper than any other place in the world I say. The cable cars up and down were enjoyed very much as well as the  scenery over looking the sea as you go up. Views from top are incredible. There's a caffe and a restaurant on top. We spent couple of hours up there and loved it."
BEST VIEWS OF ALANYA !!!!,"What a view, friendly staff, great price at 28 TL for adults, 17 TL for children for a return ticket, 22 TL adults & 14 TL for children for one way tickets. Very clean, travels at a steady pace so you can enjoy the views. Night trips available. Opens at 9.30 am Closes 23.00 pm. A must do trip while you are here."
Awesome view,It has truly awesoe view of Alanya and Kleopatra beach as well. It takes 5-10 minutes to go up and down and the ticket is not expensive. It is worth. Just get on it take some pix and videos.
so good we used it twice,"great way to fill an afternoon, amazing views and cheep 28 tl for a round trip. once up at the castle is a really nice place to just wander around sightseeing"
Nice ride over Alanya,"Fun to see Alanya from a different view. Easy to compain a visit to alanya kalesi also. Not expensive, worth of money."
Alanya cable car,To get to the cable car is a stroll on flat ground. Turn right when you come out of the port. When you get to the round about take a left turn and walk to the end of the road. The cable car takes you to the top for a scenic view to the castle. Alternatively you can take a bus or a steep walk to the castle.
Beautiful view,Nice ride from the beach up to the castle with really nice views over the beach on one side and the town on the otherside. I'd recommend you go up during the day and come back during or after sunset.
AMazing views,"It is an amazing trip up to mountain, you will get to see the beach from high high up and the rocks by the side of the mountain. A MUST"
Great way up to the castle.,"An inexpensive way up to the castle from the end of Kleopatra Beach. Costs 28TL return and the views are lovely. You can even ride up in the dark - stops running at 9.00pm, but the free lower part of the castle closes at 8.30pm."
Up to the castle ,We took a one way ticket and walked through and down back to the town. It's open until 22.00.. but a nice walk is  recommended ... beautiful view. Make sure you take the trip up little before sunset.. tickets are not expensive.. there is restaurants up in the castle area..
Nice,Good place for romantic trip. Good view for sunset on the see.Not expensive for such nice experience.
Great view over Alanya,This is the best way to reach the castle and get great views over Alanya. And it‚Äôs not expensive at 28TL for the return trip. The journey only takes a few minutes so take your photos in time!
Quick and beautiful way to Kale,"Not too much waiting, price was 22 one way and adult price also for 10 year old kids. Hmph. But the view is great anyway. Kleopatra beach, the sea, Kale and the city seen from above. Been there a few times and still it is entertaining. You can spend even a few hours up there if you want. There are souvenir shops, nice quilts and stuff to buy, restaurant, cafes and a lot of great viewpoints."
Excellent views,"We took the trip up to Alanya Castle on this very efficient cable car service, no queue whatsoever when we arrived at the ground terminal but a long queue on the way back down that was quickly despatched with each car taking 8 passengers and an operative making sure that each car was full but also ensuring that families travelled together.Fantastic views of Kleopatra beach and the town of Alanya on the way up and also your first glimpses of the castle.The cars (cabins) themselves are very clean with clean windows to maximise your view.You can purchase Return or One Way tickets and we paid 28 TL per person (approximately (¬£2.77).Once at the top terminal there is a substantial walk awaiting you with lot's of steps and you do need at least average walking fitness to visit the castle but worth it as the views are quite breath taking especially of Alanya Harbour, the sea, Kleopatra beach and Alanya town.There is a lovely restaurant at the top and some souvenir shops in the castle grounds."
Fun ride to Alanya Castle,"It‚Äôs a very beautiful and amazing ride up to Alanya Castle, lots of scenery of the beach and landscape and it is fun for everyone,"
Scared of heights üòÅ,Me and my friend are both scared of heights but decided to try this anyway. It was fantastic. Smoorh and extremely safe.  Worth a ride
Excellent views.,There were large queues for the cable cars but it was worth the wait for the excellent views and the attraction at the top.
cable car,nice way to get to top of the mountain.the views were fantastic.reasonable price as well went early morning it was quieter.
Amazing view,"We got our ticket in 2 mins, it‚Äôs a short, but beautiful trip to the castle with a breathtaking view to Alanya."
Amazing views,"Used both day and night, amazing views just a shame return ticket is date stamped as walked down and would have used the return a couple of days later but only 17lire one way or 28lire return."
Great views,It is worth a visit just to see the lovely views and walk around the bits of Alanya Castle that are free. You have to pay to see some areas. It was 28 TL but worth it and you can walk there quite easily from the main road in Alanya or depending where you are a taxi is pretty cheap. Eight people in a pod which does not stop for you to get on and off.  Only takes a few minutes but still enjoyable.
Amazing Views of Alanya,Just got back from holiday in Alanya and I must say the highlight was a ride on the Alanya Teleferik.I normally give anything high up a wide birth but was gently persuaded to give it a go!YES ...... It is very high but the views are amazing and get even better when you get off and walk to the top near the castle #amazing
Amazing Views,Amazing views from the cable car and whilst walking around the top. Few places for a drink and relax in the shade.
"Worth a trip, but if do a return be aware for a good walk at the top","Got a taxi from harbour to the castle, cost a bit but worth it as hell of a walk up in the heat. Fantastic views from top but decided to get cable car down. Cost 22TL each but worth it just for the views. Also looks great at night. A must do if you are in Alanya."
A very nice view of Alanya,"It is the best way how to get to the Alanya Castle (sorry, taxi drivers :-)) because you can go up the hill very cheaply, you can see all surroundings of Alanya and you can walk through the part of the castle where you do not have to pay any fee."
Must see it!: ),"So beautiful view from it . Amazing... the best time to visit it is late afternoon. But the castle is not well lighted, there is so much dark place in it."
Why Not,"Saw this advertised and thought why not. Got this ride on our second last day, takes you up to the Castle & is worth the effort if you are into a bit of history"
Sky High,"I did enjoy my time in the castle and road to it. It‚Äôs cheap, fast and fun. What else do you want? Must visit if you are in Alanya."
Amazing Teleferik,Take you to the castle with a good price and enjoying experience. The trip is short and the teleferik is not very high about the surface.
Lovely ride.,"Took the cable car up to the castle.Price was very reasonable, return trip is 28TL per person. When we went the queue has huge as all the coach trips had turned up, no need to worry, buy your tickets and they will call you forward ahead of the queues.Views are stunning as you ride up and down and is well worth the money.Beware that once up the top it's a long hike to the castle up some very demanding steps"
Wonderful,A very useful and efficient cable car ride. We went at around 7 PM because we wanted to see the sunset and were not disappointed. It seemed that the line was long and a little crowded but we were surprised how well organized and fast everything was going. The view was beautiful and the ride was short but pleasant :)
Brilliant,"Stunning views and wear sensible shoes as this is a walk and a half.Little stalls of souvenirs, fruit were lovely.Mosque is a must too."
Worth the money,"A great little ride up to the ruins of the castle, the cable car is cheap and efficient. The queues weren't bad although if you want to go up to see the sunset, bear in mind that you won't be the only one!"
Day trip out,Amazing views. Not to be missed! Worth the money to be able to see from the cable car as you climb up the hill. Lovely walk around castle grounds
Stunning views,"Great way to get to the castle, especially during hot weather. The trip takes few minutes and the views towards Alanya and Kleopatra Beach are breathtaking. Very reasonable price (28 TL return ticket for adult)."
Wee break. ,"This is a lovely way to go to top of castle. 28tl return. Both daytime and sunset trips are good. You get your own pod. Few shops,wc and bar at top."
Cable car ride was fun!,Thoroughly enjoyed the cable car ride to top of castle where you can see the whole of Antalya from with stunning views of ocean and town. Well worth money. Don‚Äôt pay the excursion that operators charge for Antalya city tour get bus into Antalya and book it your self works out way cheaper. We went at right time so we managed to see sunset from top. Quite a lot of stairs to climb when you get to top so people who struggle with climbing a lot of stairs might want to avoid going to top unless you just fancy cable car ride to top be back.
Quick and easy ride ,"For a few euros you can go up the mountain to visit the castle. We went up by daylight and go down in the dark. So you see both skylines. Lovely view, dont get scared if there is a queing line. You will be in the elevator before you know it"
Beautiful view of the city,"Definitely one of the most beautiful cabin rides I've been on. Not too long to make you nervous. I went up there twice, the ride is a little bit expensive but includes the entrance for the castle on top. I'd recommend going near sunset for the best view."
Worth going,"Very good day trip, lots to do. Very good value for money. Nice buildings, markets and food places. Fresh juices and stalls."
Great way to get to and from the castle,If you're in Alanya and visiting the castle then definitely worth the ride.  I went with my partner and our three youngest children and the cost was not too bad (about ¬£4 each). It looked like a long queue but it moved very quickly. The cabins seat about 7 or 8 (on the way up we shared with a couple and their baby in a buggy and on the way back we shared with 2 people).  Great views and smooth ride.
Go there just before the sunset,"Before going, check the exact time of sunset in Alanya. Going up the hill in sunset is amazing.  Be prepared that before going down you have to wait as there will be massive crowd waiting to get in the cabin to go down as well. Price for round trip is 28TRY."
Great views,"Ride was quite cheap, but wasn't very long, up hill you can see great views.Also drinks and restaurant are in the hill."
A must experience in Alanya,"Be sure to catch the sunset on the fortress, check with google, bit lets say it is around 19.40h. We arrived around 19 and the ride with Teleferik was great. We saw everything from high. We took great photos. The good thing is you get to ride only with your company, even if there is just two of you. It is very hot and the humidity is killing, so I recomend a short walk and a dinner at a beautiful restaurant at the sunset."
Best view!,"Best view ! Easy to get to the castle, also great view all the way during the ride! Safe, pleasant, greatWorth walking, bring water and camera The up the castle have nice Restaurant .."
too expensive ,you pay a lot but nothing to see dont west your time and spend your time never go again font recomend
GREAT VIEW !,"This new track to the castle is very nice! Efficient system at the gate, made waiting time minimum even though it was a long line. When at the top, you have stairs coming all the way up. On the top you have a nice restaurant with great view over the Alanya bay."
Amazing views,A must when visiting Alanya brilliant views of this wonderful city. We have done day time and night time trip night time is brilliant. Costs about ¬£4.20 each well worth it.
Great views but gets busy at the top,"We visited about 11am and experienced a very short queue to buy tickets (22TL for a one way ticket, children of 12 and 14 both classed as adults). We boarded within a few minutes (8 people per car so a bit tight to be able to move to take photos). Lovely views on the short journey. Once at the top it is quite steep to climb up to the castle. For the most part there is a good wooden walkway though they are still building it in places. Whilst the steps are not steep the climb is quite steep so not for the frail. We thought the wal down would be good and followed the stone path below the cable car landing area, it was however a bit slippy in areas due to debris from the pine trees. After a while we came to a road and followed this down to the red tower and harbour front. In hindsight taking the road from the top would have been better. There are some lovely views to be seen from the top but it was quite busy in places and the path narrow in places."
Excellent!,Very cheap. 22 TL to go up onlyYou can pay less than 44 TL to go up and down.Staff are very nice. üëåüèª
Good but too expensive!,"We tried this activity but its too expensive. Think about it, you have a nice product but you must make  publicity.   you rejecting pay money for this publicity . Even you demand money! Its interesting."
Beautiful in the day Splendid in the night,Just one of those You must DO... There was quite a queue but went quickly...We went there when there was still daylight and went back as the Sun went down Just a dream
Very nice experience,Recommended if you are visiting Alanya. The view from the castle is amazing. Better to do it at the sunset.
Beautiful view,"Very cheap way to get to the castle, also great view all the way during the ride! Safe, pleasant, greatWorth walking, bring water and camera :)"
Wonderfull view but BRING WATER.,"Easy and cheap way to get to the castle. Went up with my wife and kids to visit and enjoy the view, but with +40 degrees we where VERY happy we brought water.. It was HOT up there. The service on the Teleferik was nice and friendly and everything went smooth."
Great View,What a view you get!  Did a return journey which was 28TL i think one way was 22TL Glad we did this as takes you up near the castle and you get amazing views!
"Excellent view, but","If you going to have active vacation Teleferik should be one of the first to go. Great view and you have chance to check your way through the city. It was pity that time of increasing just around 5 minuets, and it's not so much time to fully enjoy"
Alanya June 2019,Alanya never fails to please.Lovely scenery.Very clean.Food healthy and cheap.sunbeds very cheap.Cable car well worth the visit.
Loved it,Took Kids onboard and they enjoyed it. Very nice view 28TL Adult return and 22TL child. Worth it üëçüèΩ
Good View,"Steep climb to get to the top so if you are not good with steps, this is not for you  Lovely View from the Top."
"Great view, quiet lift.","This trip can only be recommended because of the view. Adults go for 28 TRY (2 way ticket) and this include shuttle bus to the castle. The lift is very quiet compared to others we have tried. If you are in Alanya this is a ""must do""."
Great views and the best way to get to the castle,"For the best experience, go both during daytime and in the evening to get two different views of Alanya. Do bring good walking shoes.. a lot of the best views from the Castle will require some walking and climbing of the walls..."
Watch sunset. Old working Masjid. ,Paid 28TL round trip.Be ready to step on and off quickly.No AC but the ride takes no more than a few minutes.Make sure you climb all the steps to the top as local traders and Suleymaniye Masjid (built 1231) is a must.Walk round as you'll catch the different effects of the sunset plus gorgeous views of Kleopatra beach and Alanya.
Fantastic ,"It's a must going in the cable cars to the top to get to the castle n mosque, a lot of steps so it's not good for prams or buggies but great to tire the little ones out with the walking side of things n great for family pictures of the scenery it's breath taking its a must thing but go with a tour operated you can book on the street it's cheaper than going through the tour operators n you get more for your lira."
Perfect way to travel!,"Its fast, cheep and you get a fantastic view! One thing thats great to know, is that it does not take you all the way to the castle."
Beautifull view,"Its was a beautifull view on the tour up the mountain, it didnt take long from departure til we were there."
Very nice ,Just a very nice short trip up the hill. But if you want to go to the castle highest up you need to take the bus from the tram
"Amazing views, especially at sun set but bring sports shoes and mosquito repellant","Amazing views but be warned walkways/platforms are incomplete, rocky uneven ground and no lighten at night. Vendors along the way, a bit closer to the castle there is a old lady there selling hand made items and she's lovely. Good prices too without haggling to much. In my opinion better than the high street but limited. Gardenia Restaurant is a fantastic place very romantic, great food with views, you can pay in liras, USD, ‚Ç¨. It cost 20tl to get into the castle grounds although we didn't go as it cost 20tl for the cable car and the views are the same, just added history and ruins. Public Toilets were locked off, I think by the locals as right next door 1tl for woman's restroom, seems very odd. You can walk to the castle or bus taxi via road if you wish,, the dirt track is challenging and adventurous runs under cable car lines. The Mariana is only about 15 mins walk away from cable car area, also a good place to go before or after castle visit. Humidity seemed to get lower the higher we went up and is pleasant at the restaurant, obviously expect bugs beetles you are in the wilderness here. Enjoy your visit"
"Nice experience, good view over the Alanya",Nice experience. Good view over the Alanya and interesting castle ruins. Decent price for big family.
Great addition to alanya ,Fantastic experience beautiful views ! Nice to look around up there and read the history! My 8 year old nephew loves it! Been more then once as like it that much! Stop off at the elite for a nice drink after ‚ù§Ô∏è
My most favourite view in all of Alanya.,I absolutely love this view both during the day and at night.  20 lire to go up and come down. Well worth it.  The views are amazing.
Too expensive,"Its handy and everything. The last time i was in Alanya we had to catch a bus, flag a cab or walk. I'd get the bus.. it's just around the corner near Damlatas caves and cost a lira or two..Better than the Teleferik (when the price is as much as it is)"
Early evening ride on the Alanya Teleferik,"This attraction by the looks of it was built in the last ten years and is competitively priced, which means the footfall is high. Do not let this put you off because the wait time to get into an eight person gondola is minutes. Once inside you are whisked bobbing up the mountain to get out on a route to the top via newly installed wooden pathway. Beware health and safety freaks some parts at the top are works in progress and there are pieces of wood and holes. Personally I did not mind this at all and there were little kids playing with pieces of the wood constructing little shelters. The views even on a day with clouds was stunning and the air temperature was nice with a breeze. On top of the views and the fact this incredible fortress dates back to before the Ottoman Empire  and was used to store ammunition‚Äôs for centuries it also has a beautiful mosque you can visit a swanky restaurant plus traditional tea rooms and a few street vendors selling reasonably priced trinkets. If you are visiting bustling Alanya you must visit this super attraction."
It‚Äôs ok,It was ok the view is beautiful. Don‚Äôt book a tour for this. You can do it on your own it‚Äôs much cheaper. Also at the top you can visit Alanya castle but be aware it‚Äôs a lot of stairs and un even ground.
Cable car,"Absolutely must do, even if you‚Äôre scared of heights/elevators. Stunning views, very quick and very cheap. Round trip is a must, fast paced trying to get on & off even with young children and a buggy. Would recommend & would love to do it again at night time, next time!"
"Don't take the trip with ""Tours of Alanya""","Alanya Telefrik is a very nice thing to do in Alanya. We took the ""Alanya Sunset City & Cable Tour"" with ""Tours of Alanya"". They ignored the English speaking group members and focused on the Russians. We felt lost and disrespected. The trip went over the planned time with 1 hour which ruined our dinner plans in the evening. We don't recommend to take the trip with them. Otherwise, the best parts of the trip was the jeep tour in the city. You MUST do that if the weather allows. Being up in the Castle, the view and the nature is a very nice experience too. Think about having snacks or water. And bring your best knees :).We had our 4-years old boy and ha made it up to the top."
Amazing view !,"You will see Alanya city and beach from top of the hill. I enjoyed beautiful view. When you go up, there are some resting area, caf√©, gift shops and view points. Also you can take a mini hike to visit Alanya castle. There is an entrance fee to get in the castle. The view is amazing from here also. I was very happy to did extra walk and visit the castle :)"
Great value for Money,"40tl for 2 up and Down, great views and a nice all round place. A bit of a trek to the top when ya get outta the Cable car but worth it with nice shops and a restaurant and little place to sit and have a cold drink."
cable car and the castle,"It travels aprox 3 minutes and gets to the 160 meters. Ticket price for round trip is 20 TL (3 euros). After you reach the hill, you have to walk and climb the stairs of the castle. So the road after the cable car is not suitable for disabled people and strollers. Inside of the castle, there are nice narrow streets, a few souvenir shops and cafes. Best visiting time for cable car and the castle is after 5 pm in summer time. I have a suggestion for having a cold beer and enjoy the beatiful view of the city: The Hidden Garden cafe. A small family facility just to drink something. 15 min walking distance from the cable car hill station."
Awsom vantage point ,"Had a few hours to kill so too a trip upto the castle onnthe hill.A round trip ticket is 20 lira each, takes you up to the top ans back down. You get to walk roundbthe Castle remains and take in some awesome views of the resort and harbour,. Well worth a visit"
Scots  on tour,Great  way to get panoramic  views  of alanya  highly recommend  you try18 lira per person  well worth  it
Nice ride with Teleferik,Wonderful ride up to the hill. Nice walk and beautiful views all over the peninsula. And the sunset ride down to the ground is a must.
"Very fast service, great views!","Don't be afraid when there seems to be a long line to get on a cable car, it goes incredibly fast! Seems new and working well :)"
Easy Trip,Fantastic views of Kleopatra Beach. Cable car up Walked down. A Dolmus after a walk around the culture house is 3Tl.
Excellent Value - Stunning Views,"My wife and I visited here during our recent holiday in Side. I would have been more than happy to give this attraction 5 Stars. However, once we exited the Cable car at the top we were greeted by OBSCENE RAP MUSIC Truly XXX Rated, this was being played by the Staff and not paying customers. I‚Äôm no prude but this must STOP.A shame really because the the whole system is very well run by extremely friendly and helpful staff. And has been said elsewhere, extremely good value for money. There are lots of steps so anyone with mobility issues will unfortunately have to give this a miss. There are lots of places to eat and obtain hot or cold drinks. After exiting the cable car we walked all the way to the top. Stunning view over Cleopatra's Beach and the harbour. Quite trying on an extremely hot day. We planned to walk down again but discovered that the path we intended to take was undergoing refurbishment. So instead of taking the same route back we took advantage of the Free Shuttle bus back to near the top Cable Car Stop. The shuttle is free to anyone with a Teleferik (Cable Car) Ticket. We spent several very enjoyable hours here and would highly recommended it to anyone visiting Alanya"
excellent value for money,this is well worth the money but it broke down on us twice mid air scarry once up the top you then have steps to climb with resting points landing quite a hike up to the top and the other side then back again via the steps but take your camera youll never get a site better for a full view of both sides of alanya fantastic
Breath taking,For 20 lire return this cable car is unreal views of Cleopatra beach or amazing and the castle this is a must see go early in morning to avoid queues
Must Try,Really nice view and professional staff. Prices are acceptable. But the view is the best thing in here.
09:30,"It‚Äôs a 10 min elevator to heaven. ( if u get the weather right ). Went up at 09:30, instead of taking the tourist paths, I took the ‚Äòother‚Äô paths. Found myself walking around, what felt untouched paths and looking at scenery never once looked upon by human eyes. I stopped at the Gardenia Bar at the top and bought a breakfast Mojito. ( be prepared to pay ‚Äòtown‚Äô prices ) the view was unbelievable. Take your time and don‚Äô rush. Go with no timescales and you‚Äôll enjoy even more. ( 1 mojito and 2 beers to be exact ) üòÅ"
Great way to see Alanya,"This is a fantastic way to see Alanya and the gateway to the castle. Costs 20 Lira per adult (over 9!!) and 10 Lira for return.Wonderful views of the mountain, peninsula and sea. An absolute must!!"
Great view and experience!,We walked from the top of the Teleferik to a restaurant nearby that served lovely breakfast with a view. Perfect start of the day!
One of the must thing in Alanya,I really enjoyed at see Alanya beautiful city. You can see Alanya in different lights when you go to both day and night time.
Good value for the price,WE are in our 70s and had no problem walking around the castle.  There are stairs but if you take your time it is doable.  The cost for the return ride is only 20TL or about ¬£4.00 so well worth the money.  The views are fantastic.  We visited the castle and decided not to walk back but took the Teleferik back.
View to the castle,"Great option to go to Cleopatra a different way and you also see a different part og the castle. The lift closes at 9 pm but the walk way connected to the castle closes at 7pm, so this means that you can not acces the whole area of the castle. The walk way is also a bit slim for people to walk both up/down and i would not recommend anyone with leg problems as the way is steep and with many stairs. They did a really good job with fixing up the monuments close to the lift, and they keep expanding the renovations to other parts of the castle."
Brilliant views and well organised. Cheap too,Was not keen to do this but it was a great experience . The views are fab on a good visibility day. Frequent trips and well worth the money
Amazing,Took it up and walked to the mosk√©. Nice trip and not to hard to walk. Walked from mosk√© to the castle and back to the telefarik and took it back down. A really Nice trip Whith exellent view. 20 lira return.
Lovely view and ride up the Mountain,"The view is amazing and cost of a ticket ¬£2.50 ! We took the cable car up and then walked back down the other side of the mountain which has a plethora of bars and restaurants. We chose to eat at the more traditional restaurant located at the top, its run by a lovely family and really feels authentic and the food was amazingly tasty and its very cheap"
Breathtaking view,"It was awesome watching peaceful turquoise coloured sea from the cable car aka Alanya Teleferik. You can spend 2-3 hours easily here visiting many places, castles above the mountain."
Value for money cable car.,"We bought a two way ticket but my advice is just go up by cable car and enjoy a leisurely stroll back down, you can always get a return ticket at the top if you change your mind. My husband has walking difficulties but still managed it in easy stages. There are options to stop for a drink at lovely local restaurants on the way down and plenty of interesting things to see as well as amazing views."
Really nice view over the Alanya,Not too expensive way to enjoy really nice view overt the Alanaya and visit Kale casttle. I recommend for everyone who visit Alanya.
"Modern, clean, nice view","Takes you straight up to the castle with a nice view on the way up. Once there you can walk through the palace, have a drink at the restaurant up there and enjoy the spectacular view. Ether you go back with the cabin or you continue through the castle and walk down the hill back to town. It‚Äôs about a 5km walk but downhill all the way and nice places on the slopes to stay for a drink or a nice lunch oerviewing Alanya harbour, the red tower and the east town of Alanya."
Good transport,"Easy, fast and good transport up to Alanya's fortress. A great fortress with a nice view.Return ticket 20 lira."
Wonderful wiew over Alanya ,This is a must if you're coming to Alanya. Great wiew over all Alanya. You can coose to go one way or turn and return. We coosed to go one way and walk around the castle and then walk  back down to Alanya centre. The roads down is also very nice to see.
Discrimination or Fraud,"I was your customer yesterday and I noticed that employees give higher prices for children from other countries and is not ok. I believe that  company is experiencing fraud or discrimination against others countries. I say this all because I saw with my eyes and it happened, I was with my baby. For childrens from Turkey is 10 lira and for childrens from other countries is 20 lira, is not ok."
Nice cabin car,Located just beside the old castle in Alanya. Take you to the top with a wonderful view over Alanya. You can take the cabin car down again or walk which is nice.
Different view of Alanya,"We visit Alanya quite often but this was our first trip on the cable cars and it was very enjoyable. A pleasant journey followed by an uphill boardwalk with steps.Clean, well organised and with today's exchange rate well affordable."
Perfekt ,Very professional and safe. We loved it. A small walk up hill if you want to go to the kale after the teleferik. But you can also take roundtrip.
Safe and secure ,Nice views. Felt safe and secure. Take you up to a castle that you cant really access unless you pay additional charge. Has a mosque and a couple shops. Nice and cheap return fare. Cheap parking at the bottom 5 lira for 4 hours. Nice beach at the bottom.
Nice view.,"Good view, no problem, you get what you pay for, cheaper than taxi, lots of stairs when you arrived at the castle."
Spectacular view,"It is an experience worth trying! Going up to that mysterious village and the Castle by Teleferic can not be compared with going there by bus, car. We went up by Teleferic, walked around, enjoying the historical sights, and went down by foot."
Beautiful views,This was an amazing experience. Beautiful on the way up and down. Absolutely wonderful place to get a great view of Alanya. It is such a beautiful place and the view from the sky means you get to take this in. Would highly recommend to all visitors.
Seeing all from above looks as a privilege!,"If you are lucky with the weather, it is a great thing to do. The overall panorama is really stunning!"
Amazing views,Even though I have a fear of these things I did it.They were clean and comfortable and the staff helpful.Amazing views and the view from the castle were stunning well worth 20tlr
Not for me thanks,"went early december , most places closed , and not very good weather Cable car was good experience but you have to pick the right day. I Think it would probably be ok in summer ."
Gorgeous view and excellent service  ,"The service is excellent and the staff are remarkably friendly.A nice activity to do while in Alanya, to see a panoramic view of the city. Connecting the downtown with the castle area up hill."
super,"we was 2 times its perfect nice place ,nice view,cheap. no ques.we was together with childrens,our child was very happy."
A must do,"Amazing scenery, both ways. The view is even better ince you are at the top. You can hop off wonder around, take pictures. It is 20 TL return, definitely worth it."
Cable car up,Took the cable car up only 16 tl 20tl return. Took the dolmus down but a nice stroll down if you prefer.
Alanya Teleferik ride,"We decided to try the teleferik last week, we picked a windy day, but you would not have known that once inside as it was a very smooth ride.The views up to the castle were amazing, but once you climbed up the other side the views were outstanding. I would definitely recommend a trip, but it is a steep climb so you need to have decent mobility and there are a few places you can stop & rest."
Worth the experience,"Did the cable car twice, Once on a return journey costing 36TL for two adults and the second time one way costing 28TL for two adults.On exiting the cable car on the upward journey there is a steep walk up to the 'Central' point via well maintained wooden stairs with many resting places on the way up, The panoramic views over Alanya are outstanding. A mini bus is available as part of the ticket price to take you the rest of the way to the summit of the castle. It costs 20TL per adult to get access to the castle and it is a must to get  the views.Taking the one way trip gives you a different perspective of the cliff & castle as you have to walk down the opposite side from the cable car entrance, Again well kept wooded walkway some of the way, The rest well maintained Road @ pathway with some restaurant & bars along the way."
light sumon on the hill,a great opportunity to visit the fortress and mosque directly from the beach of Kleopatra. the crib are pleasant tiny and hidden places that invite you to make coffee or queues with your simplicity. I recommend
"Spectacular, try to make time for full visit to castle & return @sunset as castle closes a@5:30 off season-prices up2!","6/11/18 - We three middle aged British guys had just seen the town's main three sites (Red tower, Shipyard and Dalm Caves) on a combi ticket each for 12.We had heard about the cable car (we came from the East side) at the helpful and friendly tourist office nearby. We were told the return trip was 14 but on our arrival to the modern engineering structure it was actually 20. It seemed like a semi commercial venture judging by the price (given the combi ticket to the main attractions was only 12) but it was an exciting prospect to view the western and northern part of town towards dusk (it was nearly 5pm) and get to the top of the hill with the castle (although it was to close at 5:30 so just the trip and wander round was enough. We had already walked all the way from the harbour in the early evening before but had missed sunset and views of the west.The waiting area had posters explaining that every evening from 6pm till 9 was live music. I wondered how they would do that! Upbeat music was playing in the waiting area.As it was off season the queue to board was short and small groups and families had a cabin to themselves. We were hoping for the same but a woman joined us who turned out to be a very amiable Polish woman who we bumped into a few times and chatted more.The slow process around the gears gave way to a swift 5m/s to take us the 161 altitude difference and 830m journey over nearly three minutes. Yes it was spectacular! A ventilation window at each roof end allowed better photographs to be taken and many were! Was struck by the sheer number of satellite dishes in the rooves of the buildings, along with the solar panels and water tanks.We disembarked safely at the top to be greeted by more music. Thankfully the journey was devoid of lift muzak! The journey to the castle was via a long wooden quite busy walkway with people returning too. It ended at a castle gate and in we went through various parts of the lower castle. We had seen signs saying the castle closed at 5:30pm although I had checked the signs below saying the last return cable car was at 9pm. We had time for a drink, wander, sunset and peak at a few things although we ew the castle was about to close imminently.We made our way past a posh restaurant (no prices), synagogue, big old photos of old Alanya as a working town and early tourist resort, and up to the castle which was definitely closed by 5:35 along with all the tourist shops selling things and a cafe. We could have had a nice beer watching sunset at 5:52 but that was not possible (the authorities would probably put an end to that)  so we joined a score of people watching from the crenelated walls and made our way back to the cable car through the (sometimes badly) signposted way. We got to the lower castle gate which was closed! A man told us to go back to the mosque and take another path. We four (along with our new Polish friend) followed his instructions to find a dead end at the back of the posh restaurant (which offered lifts down at 11pm) and another person told us to get the dolmus (minibus) Past the mosque. I had read somewhere that the dolmus accepted the return cable car ticket. We found a coupe parked up, one with a few people in already. In we went and waited fifteen minutes till 6:30 when the bus left to take us the winding road back down to the cable car base. Unfortunately we had to walk the breadth of the peninsular back as well to get to our apartment in the East.We were rather cheesed off that we did not get the return cable car down to see the sea with dusk colours. On our return the cable car was still running, presumably with people just wanting the ride, view and maybe the climb to the top up to the castle gate. We were not made aware that that part of the lower castle we had had to walk through was closing at 5:30. A sign on the first castle gate saying simply ""This Gate Will Close At 5:30 - Please Use The Dolmus Shuttle Which Accepts The Return Ticket After 5:30."" As a result a 5/5 rating is reduced to a 3/5 rating as we missed out on half the trip!I just found the cable car as 'Alanya Teleferik' on TA. I also found it was #1 attraction! One image from last month October shows the journey us 14 one way and 18 return! Prices must go up off season to pay for the electricity I think! It was nice to have space though!"
fun to do,you must try this the view are the best and its cheap to do from the top you can go to the castil and the town
don¬¥t miss it,You should visit the castle on a sunday mornin around 10 o¬¥clock when you reach the top and then walk tri√≥ugh the small village with the mosque and walk to the other side where you can drive down there you will find a nice restaurant who will serve excellent breakfast with a fantastic view over the ocean
Nice but be close at 7pm,"Pros: Good way too to see entire city and take great pictures once you arrive at top and walk all the stairs up to the musem doors.Cons: Can't access the museum after 7pm, so really not worth it riding the cable car close to 7pm. If you prefer to check out the entire hilltop castle, you can rent a car and approach it from the other side via car and explore the little shops along the route and check out the old city etc"
Wonderful addition to Alanya,"Travelled up in the cable car yesterday.  Time of year meant no queues or crowds. An adult return ticket was 18TL and a student ticket was 10TL. It is a relatively short journey to the top, but beautiful views over the Taurus mountains, the beach and the castle. Be warned though that the walk at the top after you leave the cable car is significant to get to the castle. Even if you don't intend on visiting the inner castle, it's still the same walk to move on, or you just go back down in the cable car. There is a wooden walkway with handrails all the way up, but it's quite a walk and has occasional steps. There are benches along the way for rest stops. At the end of the walkway there is a free shuttle bus that takes you either to the entrance of the inner castle, or to the arsenal. We chose to just walk back down via the footpath, which starts by the k√ºlt√ºr evi (culture house). It is a gorgeous walk down, but very rocky and unsteady so proper footwear is advisable, but you get to explore the cobbled streets of the beautiful old houses. When the footpath crosses the main car road you can choose to walk down to either the cable car starting point (turn left), or to Kƒ±zƒ±l K√ºle (cross over the main road and continue down) which is the start of the liman. Highly recommended!"
So cheap,We went on this last week and at 18 lire return its so worth it. The walk upto the castle is a bit of a trek so use the shuttle bus. The views are amazing
great views,"I travelled on this at night when the views of Alanya, are amazing, there is a light switch which enables to switch off the light in the cable car to get better pictures as the light reflects on the windows. the down side is the castle was closed because it was night time."
Great way to visit the fortress.,"At around ¬£2.50 return this is real value for money. No more queuing for the bus, just hop on to the next car. It transforms a visit to the fortress since you arrive at the lower part that most people miss. You have to walk up quite a few steps to get there. Near the mosque you can them take the free shuttle up to the citadel, but it is much better to walk through what remains of the old town - the stone path isn‚Äôt the best though."
"Friendly staff, smooth ride and just over ¬£10 for a family of 4!","Very good journey up to the castle in the cable-cars. The castle and the grounds are well worth a visit for sightseers. There is also also a little village where to can have a drink or buy cheap, good quality local produce."
Cable Car to the Ancient Castle in Alanya,"If you don't have much time but want to get a feel of Alanya, its historical heritage and modern beauty, we recommend you to go to the castle by the cable car (Teleferik) on one of the first days of your stay.  Its station is located on the Cleopatra side. You can also stroll around a beautiful park there or even visit the Damlatas Cave, as it is all very close. The ride is quite short but breathtaking because of the magnificent views on the Cleopatra Side of Alanya. We recommend to take a one-way ticket, this way you will not have to go back the same way and can get more new impressions. You can always go down by bus #4, by taxi or walk if you want to exercise a bit.The Teleferik takes you to the part of the Castle called Ehmedek. From several special platforms and from the staircase (built recently for tourists) you can get amazing views of the Alaadin Keykubad side of Alanya. The higher you go, the better the views! You can walk through the Ehmedek (the palace in a fortified area). During the Seljuk and Ottoman times there was a military garrison there, as well as the sultan's treasury and an arsenal. The fortress also served as a prison and criminals were detained in its dungeons.(It is mostly under restoration now). You can keep walking along the old streets by the Mosque of Suleiman (S√ºleymaniye Cami), built in the 13th century, Culture House with an  ethnological exhibition, Bedesten (something like an inn for merchants) and other structures and ruins. You can also visit the Inner Fortress (ƒ∞√ß Kale), which is the main citadel of the castle and see old barracks, ancient water cisterns and ruins of the church of St. George from the Byzantine period, dating back to the 10-12th century period. From there you will get the most breathtaking and gorgeous views of the Alanya cliff, the Cleopatra side of town up to the Marine and beautiful bays outside of Alanya and the mountains surrounding the city. The final stop of bus#4 is pretty close, unless you want to continue the exploration of the Alanya Castle and just walk down... Enjoy it!"
Fantastic view,Fantastic view over the cleopatra side of Alanya. When you are up there are a couple of stairs to enter. Smooth and easy to access.
So helpful,"My Mum was in a wheelchair, but staff were amazing and wheeled her on and off with no issues. Amazing as it does not stop.. Lovely views but be aware lots of steps when you reach the top"
Beautiful at Sunset,"This is a must do in Alanya. views are spectacular, castle is grand, but the views, just wow! cheap too at 18tl pp return"
"Good trip, and not expensive",Easiest way to get from Kleopatra beach up to the castle. It cost 18 lira for a return trip. Definately worth doing.
Personal visit ,One of the most beautiful and stunning place to visit in Alanya. Me and my family have enjoyed the visit very much.
GOOD VALUE.................,"Went on a day trip to see the castle and took the lift down, its a fairly difficult walk down to lift from the castle(which was interesting and offered fantastic views) Had our 81 year old father in law who is very fit finding it difficult to walk on the downward sloping decking. I would also advise that you take the lift down rather than up as the walk up to the castle is very steep. seen lots of people turn around or having to stop for a breather."
Views spectacular,"My husband and son did this trip and enjoyed so much took me back the following day. Fast ,cheap and views spectacular."
"Great excursion, a must do","Popped down from Side by hire car. This was a cheap attraction (no more than a couple of quid) but worth every penny. Professionally organised to cater for crowds, though we hit it just right. The views were amazing on the way up and once up, was even more impressive. The ruins are worked on discretely, but so much to see, steeped in to much history for me to contemplate, but one of our best days out. Views down are just as stunning. Great for all ages, for older or not so agile, just chill out at the top, it‚Äôs still worth it."
"Stunning views, must do in Alanya. ","One of those must do things in Alanya.  Stunning views, very scenic. Very nice smooth cable car. Not much to say really except that just go and ride the cable car up to the castle, you will never forget the panoramic views."
Stunning Views,"18tl round trip or 14tl one way. We took the one way trip up and walked down the other side of the castle, nice new cable cars seats 8 people, with stunning views over Alanya and Cleopatra beach, once exiting at the top there is a walk up to the castle quite uneven in places. small cafes and tearoom at the top for a refreshment."
Nice view over the see,"nice short trip from city center to the castle on the top of the hill, it cost 20 Turkish leria and children for free"
Great way to get to the castle,"We have visited the castle before, but the sky ride is new for us, a great new way to get to the top of the castle. Fantastic views and very cheap to ride, well worth going. It can be found at the end os Kleopatra beach.  Their is quiet a bit of walking involved when you get to the top, so be prepared if your going up here. Not much to see at the castle, but the views are spectacular. Some nice places to eat up their too, and they do an evening run, so you can enjoy views at night."
Best way to get to the castle,"This is definitely the best way to get up to the castle. The views are fab all the way up, it is cheap and feels very safe. I purchased a return ticket but chose to walk back down. Return ticket was only 19TL so excellent value. The walk down was lovely, I would recommend it."
Nice place to visit,"Cable car ride is one of the fun things in Alanya. Good sight during ride, and really nice landscape on the top. Nice spots to take a photo and also an opportunity to view castle and church."
Nice ,"We tryed this cable teleferic twice in month august. Once in night and once early morning. We had realy fun. Amazing view, nice stuff, good price. We can recommended"
Fantastic view,"Very efficient and smooth running cable cars, friendly staff and great price either for single or return journey up towards the castle. At the end of the ride, there is a good but quite steep and stepped wooden board pathway up to the old village facilities. Not easy for pushing buggies or those who aren‚Äôt very mobile. Maybe there should be some information about this available as you get out of the cable car. It‚Äôs worth the climb to explore the old mosque, small stalls and village houses before either using the free shuttle buses or walking up to the castle at the top of the hill. Fantastic views all around and the castle ruins are worth visiting too."
"Cheap, and Awesome views","Amazing trip, which felt safe and super cheap. Highly recommend just for the views alone, and an easy way to get to the castle."
What a view! Unforgettable ,"We plan to see the view from the top of the castle so we took Alanya Teleferik and reach the top. With easy handle of payment and how the staff filled the cabin we reach the top in 3-5 minutes.Then we walked down and we have to give you all a warning here, do NEVER do that after the sun went down. There is no light at all, and no signs to follow. So you got to find your own way down.But overall I was pretty impressed.Great price list, unfortunately no price-list for you. We payed 14 Lira one way.Best Regards G√∂ran Lindvall"
TRY IT...,"You just have to try it, it¬¥s a very good experience and maybee you will try it again in the day/evening time it¬¥s 2 different experiences.But still a very good experience."
Funikuler,It takes less than 5minutes to go up on top of the mountain. Not expensive and have a nice views from the window. Big cabins which allows to enter 6 - 8 people. Have a seats inside. Glass windows from top tobottom. Have a air condition inside.
AMAZING VIEWS,Very good experience for me and for my wife.It works amazingly...the stuff is very professional. The view is amazing and worth the money. I suggest you go there an hour or two before sunset and you can enjoy amazing sunset from the citadel. You will enjoy it. Recommende.
Great view,a round trip for one person was around 3 euros. the views from the top of the mountain was amazing on both sides.
Nice,Nice cable car ride!Great views and comfortable cars.Please be aware that at the top there is still a steep climb to reach the castle!!!
Worth of money,It works amazingly...the stuff is very professional. At the moment we arrived it was 15 m long queue but it took only 2 min to get in the cabine. The view is amazing and worth the money. I suggest you go there an hour or two before sunset ao you can enjoy amazing sunset from the citadel.
Nice new attraction,"This is the newest attraction in Alanya and worth a visit. It features a really nice view of the town/sea/harbor. It's also alot easier to get to the castle this way. When at the top, be sure to walk all around the castle area and visit all places there."
Suprise in stall,Its the fist time i have been on this its not very high lasts about 1o minutes good view . Suprise is when you reach the end of the ride there loads  of stairs not suitable  for anyone who cant walk far
Worth it. ,"Amazing views of the City beach when ascending and descending. At 18 lira for a runs trip it's a good shout. Worth noting that the cars always moving, so take care when getting on and off."
Fabulous,Great ride up the mountain to the castle.   Very reasonably priced for either one way or return.   We did one way and a lovely walk down through the woods has we had already been to the castle.   You can visit the ruins of the old Alanya houses too.   Great Cable car ride
good views,worth a look and castle trek other wise grab a electric bike and go up yourself. Nice views from the castle
Thanks for Attention ,Very good place travel and feel happiness.Very old place and old things you can there.There are also excellent guides and they talk about the these places very interesting.
"Great views, nice ride up and down","We took the cable car up to the castle, walked up the wooden steps to even higher, had a pleasant drink on top and then returned the way down. It was not very busy, so we got a car to ourselves both ways - otherwise they stick to put 8 people in each, and that will be tight. There is no aircon on the cars, but a wind blows through giving breath of air. Nice views both ways to the Kleopatra beach."
Take it up and walk down.,"Went on this Twice, day and night, 0ne way trip is 14tl about ¬£2, round trip is 18tl. Went one way during the day and walked around the castle and citadel, then walked down to the harbour, not for the faint hearted, hard on the old legs, but enjoyable with plenty cafes on route."
"Best Sea, city and Mountain View",The absolute stunning view with great scenario within 360 degrees... extremely pleasant and comfortable cable cars which gives you a wide sight of what Alanya is about.. Love this place and inexpensive roundtrips 18TLira
Great view from the cabins,This cable car is a really cheap option if you are going to the castle. The view is beautiful and you can take photos from the cabin.
Amazing views,We took the cable car down from the fort and was very impressed with it.  Modern and stunning views over cleopatra beach
Very nice and cheep,"Me and the wife walk to the cable car on a Friday got a return ticket 18 liras each waited 3 minutes to get on it , once at the top you have still got a hike to the castle grounds which will cost you another 15 lira each to get in"
Nice view,"The cabins are nice to sit in with a wonderful view in all directions, the trip just take few minutes from the park up to Alanya Castle. Its not expensiv if you buy a return-ticket."
Must do it!,"Exciting experience!I really enjoyed our ride, even a baby in a stroller was completely satisfied!what I would suggest doing is:Take funicular in the morning ans spend the whole day in a castle. DO IT! This is a great way to get near the top of the mountain an there is an entrance to Alanya castle with lots of great places inside! dont be afraid - there is a number of completely authentic caffees and you will not be left hungry. After you have seen all the spots in the castle - you can use funicular to get you back =) if neccessary"
What views,Took a ride in the cable car upto the castle on my parents recommendation and it did not disappoint. Start on kleopatra beach and stops just below the castle. Lovely views up and down and a lovely view overlooking the harbour from the top. Also air conditioned cars so nice and cool. Would highly recommend
"WoW, Amazing ride.","WoW, Amazing ride where we did to reach to of Ahmadek citadel, we saw a beautiful beach from top, and these amazing green areas."
New cable car in Alanya ,New experience in Alanya on must do. Recently they started this new experience from kleopatra  beach  to Alanya kalesi. The pass will let you access the fort also. Best timing is before sun set Very good experience with lot of panoramic views
Must try it,"The shortest way to the castle , we enjoy the fantastic view over the beach and the city but it cost more than taxis. round trip 18 TL"
Go see the castle,"I can recommend using the cable car to the top and walk down on the other side to the harbor. Its a nice trip. View is good, and from the cable car you can see all of Cleopatra beach."
Great view,"Alanya castle's view is amazing. To reaching there easily was awesome. Intentially, we chose the sun setting time. So, the scene was breathtaking. The only negative side was the journey was short. Maybe more stations can be added later."
The easy way to get up the hill,"Very convenient, especially on warm days as the hike up the hill can be pretty intents in 38C temperatures."
Lovely view of Kleopatra,"Beautiful view, managed to get some stunning snaps. Also its a quick way of getting to the Castle by Sulaymaniye Mosque."
The best seaview around,Taking a ride with Alanya Teleferik U can get one of the best Alanya must see! The best seaview from inside and from the top. Not very expensive. Worthy. Basicly no queues! Everything goes fast and fine!
Visit with daughter,Very easy to find and ride is cheap. You have nice views over the town and beach. Walking on top can be very hot.
combine the cable car with your visit to the castle,for 1 price(17TL per person)you can go up with the cable car and you can get out at the top to visit the castle and drink something too.You must climb a bit but beautifull views.During the day its mainly the views that will amaze you and during the night its a very romantic trip
View over beautiful Alanya,"I took the ""teleferik"" two times when I visited Alanya this June. The first time we took it late in the evening. Of course it's more to see when the sun is up, but it's a nice thing to do in the evening too. More comfertable temperature and not that much tourists. The second time, we took it earlier. When the sun was going down. Much more tourists and much warmer! But again, much more to see. Not reccomended wheelchair users or so, because of the path from the teleferik and up to the castle. The ""sad"" thing about this teleferik is that the whole tour is over in just a few minutes. Maybe 5-6 minutes or so. It's cheap dough, 14tl for one ride, one way. Enjoy!"
A nice thing to do when You're in Alanya!,Affordable and nice trip to do when in Alanya! 5 min waiting in que and a nice walk to the castle with great viewes!
Just go in :),"I went with my children , 3 and 10 year old. And they loved it as well.  I went two times. one time during the day and one more time when the sun was about to go down. it's amazing. It's clean and looks save and strongüòÇ ones you are up its a hard walk if you want to go visit the castle."
Head for heights,"Only 9 months old and always full of travellers wanting to experience that views right across Alanya and Oba.Could be a problem for someone with no head for heights or walking difficulties as the you disembark form the car, you have a number of steps and sloping pathways to encounter. The castle is much higher up and the climb can take your breath away."
Nice views,"We paid about ¬£2.50 (15tl) each for the return journey up to the castle - very cheap, The views were great but it was hard going from the cablecar to the castle lol"
Amazing!,"Very beautiful view, highly recommend. You can see all beautiful Alanya. And price was good as well, we paid ‚Ç¨7 for 2 adults."
we are living in best side.,Alanya cable car must be seen immediately by all people. Beatiful panoramic wiew is unique. Until this experience I did not saw this side of alanya castle. Builders respected naturel structure of this hill. I appreciated for this approach. congratulations.! by this cable car I invented new tracking paths on alanya castle .
A Scenic Voyage from the Centrum to the Citadel,The cable car recently installed in Alanya. One way trip takes 6 minutes. You can take many pictures during the trip. You have an option to buy one way or return tickets.
The best way to visit the castle hill.,"Unless you enjoy walking several kilometres up the hill on winding alleys or prefer taking a minibus from the bus station, the cable car is an excellent way to get to the castle hilltop. There are good views of the city and the beach area from the cable car."
Views to die for,Used the teleferik twice to reach Alanya Castle from Cleopatra beach .Ten lira one way (2 ¬£ ) or fifteen lira return .Breathtakingly scenery at a excellent price . Still a bit of a hike to the top but worthwhile .
Amazing views at the top!,Round trip costed 15 Turkish lira. It took 5 minutes to get to the top and the views were fantastic. The trip is very recommended.
Cable car to the kale,Really good new attraction in Alanya. 18tl for a return trip up to the castle with fabulous views over Cleopatra beach. You can alight at the top and explore the castle at your leisure enjoying an Efes or two along the way. Really good value.
Cheap and easy way to go up,Easy way with a view to go up to Kale. Cable car goes NEAR the castle. Last couple of hundred meters walking through the local old buildings.Certainly worth for a money.
A lot easier than walking all the way up!!,"This is new and we elected to use it having been unable to locate the no 4 bus which goes up to the castle.  The departure point is by the garden near Cleopatra Beach and not far from the Damlatas cave.  We elected to go up on the cable car and walk down which is an option as well as a return trip.  The price was fairly cheap, I think 18 TL return and a bit less for one way.   Very fast and slick. Note the cable car goes most of the way up but does not go quite all the way to the castle,  there are steps to walk up from the top station, about a five minute walk uphill but great views so frequent stops for photos. Worth noting for anyone with mobility issues or children in a buggy etc though,"
A great experience!,"So lucky to go on the Cable Car from Damlatas to the Castle on the day it opened. Never been on a Cable Car before so it was a bit of a wow! moment. Great views all the way up (and down)!  Very clean, very new and very reasonably priced.It is a bit of a schlep from the Station at the top into the Castle but it's a good walkway and feels very safe. Loved it!"
Working perfectly ,"Going up, visiting in the castle area and coming back down only 18 liras. Nice, quiet and fast elevator. Easy to find next to street."
New cable car,"Only opened six weeks ago,the teleferic runs till 10 at night from Damlatas to a staging post near the bottom of the castle..all pristine with efficient staff.We paid 18tl for a round trip per person,child discount applicable at 10tl..give it a go as the views are brilliant."
