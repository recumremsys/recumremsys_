Must visit place,A great contruction by the architectures. The bridge connects the city and the holly place where you will see the ashrams and lodges. You can see below at the river if have gutts but it will be fine when you dive it in by jumping from your rafting boat.
Rishikesh,So fun Australia I went to Rishikesh for the second time and again this place remind me that I am there.
Beautiful Ganges,One of most beautiful spot to enjoy The Ganges. I arrived at afternoon to attend Ganges Aarti. Beautiful afternoon with cold weather seems i just found the compress of the world.
Excellent,"One of the famous landmarks of Rishikesh , great views of the holy river Ganga all around . Very tranquil and peaceful"
Major attraction,You can ride your bike on this bridge to reach other side of the River. Too crowded in the evenings. Looks wonderful in the dark because of the way it is lit
Beautiful,Beautiful view from the bridge üåâ. While you are in Rishikesh do visit the place with fail. Thank you
All the madness of India in a single span.,"Ram Jhula is one of two ""footbridges"" over the river Ganges in Rishikesh India. I put footbridge in inverted commas because the bridge is also used by many motorbikes and motor scooters who use their horns to clear a path for themselves as they cross. The  bridge is also usually inhabited by at least one large cow/brahma bull and several monkeys. Warning: do not carry any fruit with you as you cross the bridge because a monkey will have taken and eaten it before you get to the other end of the bridge. Every time my wife and I cross the bridge we give a small prayer that we made it unscathed. If you want to add a little adventure to your otherwise dull lives this is the place to do it. p.s. the other footbridge has recently banned motor bikes and motor scooters from the bridge, but the bovine and primate populations still inhabit, so  the same cautions apply. p.p.s. I forgot to mention to cow poo: watch your every step!"
look out for the scooters,"Although a nice bridge, with wonderful views, it is spoiled by the incessant scooter traffic. Go to Laxman Jhula instead."
Watch for motorcycles!,"Unlike the other pedestrian bridge in town, this one allows motorcycles and scooters. As a consequence it‚Äôs a little less relaxed for crossing and more difficult to stop and take in the view."
A great location,"I was staying near by the bridge and it is a very vibrant and active area of Rishikesh. Shops, food stalls, sadhus all fill the near by streets.The bridge is wide enough for three abreast.The monkeys seem to like it too as they play around"
Historic Bridge,Visited during the evening time. Very very scenic and much longer bridge than the Lakshman Jhula. Two wheelers are allowed on this bridge which is not a very nice situation as have to constantly keep a look out for the vehicles going through. The banks of the river are very serendipities and peaceful. A Must visit place but would be much better without the two wheelers on the bridge
Awesome,Ram jhula is one of the suspension bridges in india. Standing here you get the full view of river Ganga. Very beautiful sight. The jhula is wide enough and has lot of space. There are various water sports around and Beatles ashram is also nearby. A must visit place if visisiting rishikesh.
Very interesting Bridge and Area!,"An impressive Bridge (longer than Laxman Jhula), full of life, walking people,motorbikes, cows, monkeys, colours, wonderful view over the Holly Ganga river under your feets, but also an interesting area for a walk, litle shopping or for a coffee, lunch etc.!! Don't miss to return/ cross the other side, by the small boat! It takes only 3-5 min. (and only 10 Rs), but it's a beautiful experience..!!"
Ram jhula Rishikesh,The place is overcrowded and congested. But view of hills and boating in Ganges are enjoying.   Also bathing ghat is there.
Beautiful bridge ,"Very well kept bridge for pedestrians & two wheelers . Excellent view of the Holy River,  Ghats , temples and surrounding mountains n greenery. The illumination & lighting on the vertical support structure makes the entire bridge a  delightful sight at night ."
Beautiful suspension bridge,"Quite busy from 9 am to 10 pm with motorcycles, cows, bicycles, carts, and people. Lit up and beautiful at night. A nice place to listen to the daily puji ceremony."
‚ù§Ô∏è,Great way to pay obeisance to d river by going across walking n enjoying d breathtaking scenery Took a guide to explain d place
An overwhelming experience.,The bridge was truly remarkable.  Beautiful scenery.  The only flip side was the motor bikes which was allowed on the bridge. They had no patience for the pedestrians.
Impressive Structure,It is an impressive bridge across River Ganga. You can get good views if you visited it during the day time. Unfortunately we visited it at night. Still the views of the night lights of the city around amazed us. The Rishikesh Ganga arati which happens nearby is a must watch if you are visiting Rishikesh. But one thing I did not like about this bridge is that it is very crowded and also two wheelers which use bridge create a lot of congestion for pedestrians.
Good Views,The view is just amazing and worth a visit. I visited the place late in the night and was not disappointed with the place at all.
Impressive bridge with great views,"The Ram Jhula is one of 2 major suspension bridges over the River Ganges in Rishikesh. Like the Lakshman Jhula, it‚Äôs also supposed to be a pedestrian only bridge in theory, but plenty of motorcycles use the bridge anyway. This bridge is far more impressive than the Lakshman Jhula though as it‚Äôs almost twice as long and a great spot to see the River Ganges and the many Hindu temples on both banks of the river. The bridge is also popular with monkeys and you do have to be careful with your belongings."
Rishikesh ram jhula,"Ram jhula....Yes the famous lakshman jhula is closed now a days...Now a days it's ram jhula which u can visit. It's very long...All stood on wires...Its built over ganga river...Which can be crossed thru a boat...Its chilled in december...couldn't dare river rafting in such chilled weather...There is geeta bhawan on its bank where geeta is written all over the walls...The awesome shiv statue right in the river...Also there is a rameshwar temple (before this, had not heard of any rameshwar temple other than in south)...Also visited the famous chotiwala restaurant...Now there r 2 of them..Just side by side. ganga arti there is mesmerizing. Madras cafe is recommended...I didn't like momos n bhel there."
A very noisy bridge,The bridge itself is quite nice looking. Unfortunately all motorcycles constantly honking and trying to pass all the people ruin the atmosphere. I prefered the other bridge way more where the motorcycles are not allowed.
Ram Jhula,A Suspension bridge over the Holi river Ganga connecting the two sides. There is boat facilities as well to cross the river
Not that amazing,Very crowded and I'll recommend that motorcycles to be avoided. You do get a beautiful view of the ganges. One of the attraction of Rishikesh.
Modern Version of Old Luxman Jhula Bridge,It is made in the memory of Swami Shivananda in 1986 on his birth Centenary. Initially and officially the bridge name was Shivananda Bridge but people never called it by that name due to sentimental reasons of Luxman Jhula Bridge ( Luxman ji is was Younger Brother of Shri Ram - From the story of Ramayana ). This bride is bigger than Laxmun jhula so people saw it like a big brother. Before 1986 there was only Boat for crossing the river but now you can have both. Boats doesn't work during Rainy season. People now take selfie on it and that obstacle the traffic sometimes. It is lighten up by Tiranga ( 3 Indian Flag Colour Lights) and it looks beautiful in night. Many movies and TV programs are shot here.
Nice structure,"Ram Jhula is for walking and two wheeler vehicle but not for four wheeler.It is over the Ganges river,connecting both sides. Mountains are  sourrounding this place, View from the bridge is awsome specially the river rafting view.You can find temples on both sides, also take holy bath in the river ganges."
Walking,Very dangerous with motor cycles traveling both ways and honking all the time. These riders dont slow down.
Ram Jhula,One of the best attraction of Rishikesh..longest among the two (other one is Laxman jhula).. excellent view of holy Ganges and the mountains.. truly scenic and a very good place for photography also..totally enjoyed!!
Fine but nothing great ,Ram Jhula is just a bridge. What becomes irritating is the permission of two wheelers so does not feel any different than any other place. It is however kept pretty clean.
Nice place,It is a wonderful place. River Ganga is so beautiful. A must visit place to sit idle and enjoy. There are so many fishes in the river. Geeta Bhawan is also a place nearby.
Peace is lost in the sounds of  motor bikes,"Ram jhule is one of the very famous hanging bridge in Uttarakhand. The view of the bridge is just mesmerizing. The very clean green water will definitely allow your brain to turn on the meditation mode. Unfortunately, the motor bikes going through the bridge will never allow you to get that piece. I  really hope that they  should stop the motor bikes to cross the river via this wonderful bridge. But i know it will never be true. Anyway still it is beautiful, peaceful place"
Ganga Darshan,"The walk on & around Ram jhula is beautiful, Lovely small shops, small lanes, lots of chaat stalls around, even came across a bakery on wheels, which served freshly baked nankhatia (sweet biscuits) on the streets. Tried the Ramphal fruit which was very unique.Visited the Parmarth Niketan for the evening Arti."
It is fun walking across the river Ganga over this bridge!,It is fun going over this bridge which is open to humans and two wheelers. Did not see any cows crossing but can not rule out that either! There are nice shops on both sides which sell lot of stuff required for anyone living in Rishikesh. Not necessarily gift articles though there are several shops here for that. Better ones are near Laxman Jhula.
Freshness overload,Hanging bridge on top of Ganga river for walkers and two wheelers to cross. Amazing views and fresh air. You can walk by and across is 30 mins or so. But this bridge can get crowded
Calm and peaceful,"We walked across the iconic Ram Jhula during the day. Fresh air filled us. However, it was a bit crowded since two wheelers are allowed to cross this bridge as well. it is not a long walk. Can take 10-15 mins if you strolling"
Inhale the freshness!,"This is one of those places where you feel calm and happy. Cool breeze from the river will play with your hair. This is a heart warming experience. Beware there can be a bit of a traffic during the day. Sometimes cows also congest the jhula. Go for a walk in the night, that'd be a great experience."
AMAZING VIEW,be care from the monkies they are thief and can bite you. the bridge is very intersting you can pass the town from side to side. it is most beutiful in the evening when sunset
Beatiful ceremony,"Every night before sunset, thousands of people gather at the Dashashwamedh Ghat to witness this special ceremony. This tradition has been a part of the Ganges river for several hundred years. Ganga River or Ganges is an important sacred river for Hindus. People consider this river as a Goddess. This ritual is a greeting to the Goddess of the river.At the beginning of the ceremony in the center the priests recite mantras and the families who have asked to thank or ask for something from the gods sit around the fire next to the priests.Young priests, dressed in saffron robes, are only allowed to recite mantras sung in this ritual. Many oil lamps will be illuminated and balanced in a synchronous movement.People with their hands bring the smoke from the lamps to be sold by them and share it with foreigners in their desire to share good luck. Finally, offerings composed of baskets of flowers and a lit candle are thrown into the river."
old bridge,its a beautiful walk crossing the bridge and a view of mother ganga. the bridge is crowded with people walking and taking selfies and lot of locals crossing by 2 wheelers which is a chaos.
very crowded,"as the two wheeler traffic has been stopped from laxman jhula , the ram jhula was very crowded and more two wheeler traffic coming to ram jhula."
It's ana amazing visit,Nice bridge built on the Ganaga river. Always found 100s of people crossing the river using the bridge. This bridge makes me feel wonder with its structure and length. Its built using the cables. Its a must visit place. You will find lot of Dharmashalas and Ashrams after crossing the bridge. Its an awesome ecperirnce.
Newer bridge ,"Some 2 kms by road from Lakshman Jhula, can also take a walk by the river via Ganga beach, this is the newer of the 2 famous bridges."
"Loud, crowded, and best to avoid","This is a tourist spot and you'll find lots of fun people watching around this bridge, however the actual bridge is packed and should be avoided at all costs, that is...unless you enjoy anxiety."
One of the Two Famous Suspension Bridges in Rishikesh,Along with Laxman Jhula this is one of the two famous suspension bridges in Rishikesh. Suspended over fast flowing Ganges it offers nice view.
Fam ,Was very crowded but yet very peaceful in its own way .aarti was highlights of that place must visit as the buzz is beautiful
Busy market area of Rishikesh ,"This busy market area in Rishikesh is impossible to miss. For Indian and international tourists alike, search for trinkets, find a restaurant or sample the street food. Named for the Ram Jhula bridge, it‚Äôs a cool place to explore."
Chaotic,"The suspension bridge called Ram Jhula in Rishikesh isn't exactly pedestrian friendly. You'd have to jostle for space with two-wheelers, cycles, beggars and monkeys. Unless you're there at an ungodly hour, I can't imagine a peaceful crossing enjoying the views at this bridge. It connects the Shatrughan ghat on one bank of Ganges to the other bank with Geeta Bhawan. The gentle swaying of the bridge as you walk really fascinates the kids and adults alike."
"Great, Quiet place!","I visited in morning time, just doing a morning walk from my hotel, and it felt great. More than the Ram Jhula, what lies ahead and beyond is important. The Ganga side sitting area, where you can just sit on the river side and get a calm experience. There is the splendid Lord Shiva Idol too. And lots of shops around where you can have good food and coffee. All in all, a great place to spend some time..."
Best shopping,Ram Jhula is full of wonderfulPlaces to get your shopping on! The bookstores are astounding and reasonable priced. The walkway is colourful and full of sounds and visuals to feed your senses. Lovely Ayurvedic stores are close to the bridge on both sides.
Experience of lifetime ,It was a once in lifetime experience standing on this bridge and looking at the mighty Ganga river below . Such spiritual signs here
Downstream but Not Down,"Ram Jhula is a relatively new bridge compared to its companion bridge further up stream. It was constructed in 1986 and continues to permit vehicular traffic.  Being a wider bridge one can perhaps anticipate that at least one of the two bridges would accommodate the smaller vehicular traffic, i.e. the 2- wheelers. Not gated means of course that it also serves as a route across for the ubiquitous cows. For first time visitors it might serve as a possible route to consider, to park or get off at the Ram Jhula area when entering Rishikesh, cross the bridge and turn Left, and then carry on along a rather nice wide new stone path leading up,and exiting by the Police Station. Here you turn Right and return to the bridge along the road. Going left takes you up to Lakshman Jhula Bridge."
An experinece with a Guide,"As explained by tye titlle with visited this place and decided to take a guided tour which is offered by many trained guides around the parking entrance of the Jhula.I believe ww would havw just crossed the bridge and done some local shopping if it wasnt for the guide who actually explained us the whole journey of how the bridge was made and the several important temples and ashrams built on either side of the bridge. We tried to keep pace and cover all the key areas. The only sad part was that the bridge also allows motor vehicles to pass through which is a bit of a nuisance.P.S. If you intend to buy any souvenirs like rudraksha, spathik or any other stone craft; stick to the shops which are managed by the Uttranchal tourism. They are fixed price and quality assured."
An important attraction to take you to the Yoga world on the other side,Take a walk on this bridge to experience the view on both sides and the Ganga river below. The other parallel bridge is Ram Jhula which is about 2KM away.
A Brother to Laxman Jhula,"Compared to the Laxman Jhula, the Ram Jhula is a recent construction built about 38 years back. It has comparatively a more robust construction though it too is an iron suspension bridge across the Ganges.This bridge is in the more downstream portion of the Holy River and connects the Tehri Garhwal district with the Pauri Garhwal district.A grand view of the Ganges is visible from the Jhula. Pedestrians & two wheelers are allowed to use the bridge.There are a no. of Ashrams in it's vicinity though cleanliness is wanting.It's brother, the Laxman Jhula is located about 2 kms. from it.The bridge span is about a quarter of a kilometre and has the same technology of construction as the Laxman Jhula."
Must see place in Rishikesh,Ram Jhula is one of the main picnic spot in Rishikesh which is located at the distance of 3kms from the main city. this place offers the scenic beauty of river ganga with fresh air.
Religious visit,We visited rishikesh and also visited ram jhula which is built over the sacred river and gives a tremendous view.
Ram jhula to see ganga arti,"It seemed at the time we visited laxman jhula was closed for repairs so all traffic was on Ram jhula,  it made walking not enjoyable as there was lot of traffic in terms of people trying to take pictures n selfies,  walk, also there were scooters and motorcycles constantly honking,  There are so many ashrams and big name sadhus and organizations in rishikesh but it was sad to see cows,  old age people either eating polythene,  pooping and begging.Things that could be improved - separate walkways for pedestrians, some organization ensuring cows are in a particular area where devotees can feed them,  it will also help maintain cleanliness in such a beautiful place,  some organization helping old age beggars and disabled people, Things that were beautiful - gangaji,  aarti and still a spiritual feeling one gets when visiting...."
Oportunity lost.,Visited this place with friends and family.Hanging jhula connecting 2 village over the Ganges.Good walking experience but undone by traffic?? Yes ...2 whellers are also allowed on this.......Making it not only unpleasant but also unsafe.
Bridge across Ganga at Rishikesh,It's 3 km from Triveni ghat Rishikesh. You can reach through a share auto for ‚Çπ10. Youbhave to walk for 10 minutes to reach this bridge. Ofcourse it is a hanging bridge andbyou can feel the vibration while walking. It's a very long bridge and once you reach otherside you can go to laksman jhula. Beware lot of people approach you as guide and demand ‚Çπ100 to #150. Nothing special for guide. From the middle of the bridge you can see the Ganga flowing which is mesmerizing.
Marvel among suspension bridges,"Its just a simple bridge, But i would recommend you to go there at night time to witness its ethereal beauty with all the lights and without any traffic rush with cool winds caressing your hair......It feels like heaven so peaceful and beautiful üåÑüåÑüåÑüåÑ and don't forget about the sunrise in the morning...."
Very untidy and conjusted.,Hi!The Jhula is used by 2 wheelers! Its very cumbersome to use the bridge.Moreover Cattle and stray dogs keep coming your way.I do not recommend this to cross the river.Very untidy. AVOID.Just visit the banks of Ganga.
Must to go,"Ram Jhula must not be forgotten if visiting Rishikesh, Its very important place in Rishikesh. Its and iron suspension bridge across the river Ganges. It is situated near Muni Ki Reti in Rishikesh. Ram Jhula is one of the most popular attractions of Rishikesh."
Ram Jhula -2nd of the two Jhulas,This is the 2nd Jhula of Rishikesh. This is basically a hanging bridge ove the river Ganga. The view is awesome. Be aware of monkeys.
FUN,"The Jhula, is at strategic place, near to bypass. It comes first then the Laxman Jhula. Close to Parmarth niketan temple. View from Jhula is awesome, also since it keeps on swinging, it is a thrill."
Nice view from Ram jhula,"Your chance for a perfect evening stroll...go across Ganga river by boat, perform evening aarti, shopping and then walk back from Ram Jhula ."
Great sightseeing tour of Rishikesh included a visit to Ram Jhula üôèüèªüáÆüá≥‚ù§Ô∏è,"We visited as part of a guided tour with Raj Singh https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g580106-d17648643-Reviews-Yoga_Adventures_India-Rishikesh_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html?m=19905Ram Jhula is a very popular location to visit while in Rishikesh. This bridge is one of two in Rishikesh, it‚Äôs extremely busy with both locals and tourists. You won‚Äôt just find people on this bridge you will also monkeys and cows. You can visit this bridge self guided or by using a local guide as part of a day tour. We used a guide as mentioned above, we got to visit the bridge, visit the local markets, see plenty of animals, cross the Ganga on a boat. It‚Äôs well worth visiting when in the area."
Suspension bridge,"It‚Äôs a well designed long suspension bridge to cross river ganga. It is crowded by salesman's, photographers, has cows, and is painful to cross because of all the two wheeler bikes and noise and crowding. But around this bridge is the main area for travelers, so pick a side and find a place there."
One of the must visit place!,The Ram Jhula is a marvelous piece to visit and experience the holiness! Must visit place in Rishikesh!
"landmark of Rishikesh, must visit","Ram Jhula and Lakshan Jhula , must visit landmarks of Rishikesh. ( Both are Suspension bridges )Ram Jhula is always easy to reach within city - should take auto from parking.Its very nice to walk near by for the small vendors shops along with ganga river.view from Ram Jhula is breathtaking....mountains, river, boats ( while crossing the bridge...Please do not take selfie when too much crowded.Local Police has also advised not to take photo while on the bridge - That may end up fine upto 5k INR or phone can be taken by police.Biggest problem is 2 wheeler - which keep crossing without any discipline.Choti wala Famous restaurant is on the other side which you need to cross using Ram Jhula or by boat.Overall very nice to walk around. Sit at Ghar after crossing bridge which is very relaxing."
Religiously significant. Need to be preserved.,You feel the presence of divinity around you when you visit such historically religious places. This looks even more beautiful when lights are on. The government should do all they can to preserve such places and keep it clean.
Nice place to roam around,It's a nice site but newer than Lakshman Jhula. You can enjoy the nearby ashrams and do shopping. You can cross ganga by boat and also take a dip at ghat.The bridge is always very crowded and even motorists using it makes it really chaotic.The view of river from middle of the bridge is really amazing.
Religious to spiritual ambiance .....,"As it is well known according to the Indian epic Ramayana that Lord Ram is the elder brother of prince Laxman. So the similar  to that when we enter in the area the first bridge is called Ram Jhula on Holi river Ganges, which is nearest around 400 mtrs from main Badrinath road then with a distance of almost two km the next bridge as a younger brother of Lord Rama the Laxman Zhula is situated. The Ganga Arti/ worship ceremony happens every day on the holy river banks. People of all walks of life come here to feel the serenity and to pass the rejuvenating current of the company of Mother Ganges. Morning evening all the time sitting near by the soothing water of river Ganges is  a blessing of enormous tranquility.Staying & food all things are in reach only to consider the season or booking in advance if the high season is going on. India is a multi cultural nation and believe in co - existence, so be assured and prepare with some flexible approaches regarding the things/services  or in simple words you may find some social touch with the services or dealings around instead of western sheer professionalism. Sure that is really interesting.The cabs, auto rickshaws from the city and hand rickshaws at the bridges available easily.My own experience is all good and there are some changes taking place to shape and maintain the very values of the place.Therefore take a call to feel the charms of the Holy city of Rishikesh and rexplore yourself. Thanks & Regards"
Iconic,"We stayed right next to the Ram Jhula. Almost like staying on top of this beautiful bridge. It lights up in the evening in tri-colors. And is a bustling place. Hordes of tourists squeezing atop, somehow managing to take selfies, even while locals & visitors buzz past on two wheelers. It really is iconic, and almost reverentially looking over the river. Just cant miss this one if you are in Rishikesh. This doesnt even need a review :)"
Too much crowded waiting for  Mishap,"Extremely crowded  streets of approach with narrow roads, vehicular traffic and bad pollution.As usual more local business than quietness.Difficult for even going on the bridge due to surging crowd."
Human Conveyer Belt,Most of the time there is so much rush on the Jhula that you are automatically transported to next side. Like in evening before and after Ganges Aarti
Ram jhula,Another bridge to cross the river and get to the temple for the aarti and the other side of the city.
Engineering marvel,Unique. The second bridge constructed to cater for the padestarian traffic and almost parallel to Laxman jhula down stream side of Alakananda river.Very very photogenic.Great view of river rafting too.
Good One,The lighting during the night is amazing. It becomes over crowded because of people who try to click selfies
crossing river so easy,its a nice hanging bridge to cross river ganga . one can walk down to the evening arati place. only problem scooter and bikes are allowedwhich makes difficult to avoid.the bridge is done and wonder in its construction.
crowded always as motorbikes pass by too..,very crowded - motorbikes and walkers together impossible to cross during evening time- i wish motorbikes had a separate route and this Ram Jhula would have walkers only..
One of my favorite place in Rishikesh,"Less tourists there and more authentic people, lots of pilgrims from all over India - one of the most interesting place to be, stay, and watch people who cross the bridge from Rishikesh to the ashrams"
Ram Jhuuuuula,Ram Jhula is one of the main iconic landmarks of Rishikesh. The bridge connects the two places Sivananda Nagar and Swargashram where one can enjoy the fresh air and scenic beauty of the region. Big problem of this bridge is Two Wheelers driving with out any discipline.
Day and night ,It's something to see and experience the look of ram jhula in the day and the night is spectacular.... the shop owners and nice and kind and its a lil slice of rishikesh you must vist
Second fiddle,In mythology Ram the elder brother is the hero but here he has to play second fiddle to his brother Lakshman. But yet this is as beautiful as the other bridge and serves an important role for local people.
Disappointed,We wanted to visit the Ganga Aarti so we had to cross the bridge and we started crossing but the bridge as very shaky and I felt like we were going to fall and they let bikes because it was spacious. I did not like the trip across Ram Jhula
Best Engineering Example,"I had visited this place many times because my best destination in India is Rishikesh.Recently I have visited Ramjulla with my life-partner between 9th to 12th may,2019 on my stat in Rishikesh.There are only two main option to cross holi river Ganga from city side to Swargashram (the spritual side of Rishikesh),Lakshmanjulla and Ramjulla,both are suspension bridges,hanging through a steel rope."
Ram jhula,It is good but the cattles & two wheelers must be stopped to go through ram jhula .it is risky to cross because of rash driving of two wheelers.
Ram Jhula,Ram Jhula is one of the main iconic landmarks of Rishikesh located at the 3 Km from the main city. Ram Jhula build in the year 1986 and this is an iron suspension bridge. The bridge connects the two places Sivananda Nagar and Swargashram where one can enjoy the fresh air and scenic beauty of the region.
Popular place for people coming for religious visits,"One of the two famous bridges (the other being Laxman Jhula) across Ganges.this is a popular place for people coming for religious visits esp owing to the various ashrams near it, the most famous being the Gita Bhavan and SwargashramThere is also PArmarth Niketan near it."
Close to Parmarth Niketan,"The evening Ganga Aarti takes place at Parmarth Niketan. If you are on the other side of river Ganga, then the easiest way to reach Parmarth Niketan is by crossing via the Ram Jhula. The Jhula was not as crowded as Lakshman Jhula during our visit. The bridge is lit up when sun sets & it looks beautiful."
Nice,It‚Äôs a suspension bridge said to be iconic of Rishikesh. Was a little crowded and motorbikes kept crisscrossing as we walked. The views are pretty. Not wheelchair friendly.
Nice views but crowed,It shows nice views but it is really crowed with locals coming in 2 wheelers from both ends. Quite difficult to get a photo clicked at such a nice place. I wish these 2 wheelers are banned in our next visit.
The holy side of Rishikesh,Here you find some temples and lot of familes. The lights on the bridge truly look amazing more lie the SFO bridge.Again shopping can be done here too and this bridge is much more wider. People animals and also bikes can cross over.Be there to experience itCheersShilpa
Ram jula,"I bridge you will never forget. I really do wish the locals would either walk thier scooters across or at least not beep thier horns, as it is such a privilege that they cannot cross this bridge."
Beautiful of india,This place was a miracle place the ram jhulla was a amazing beautiful place.... We all know ganga river was India's biggest river and the Rishikesh place famous foe ganga river and ram jhula & laxamn jhula both made with out pillars..... Without land support the miracle was the jhulla was very very old and they are perfectly main also now.... Sooo this was a biggest thing.. And their beauty no words i have.. Because you cabt judge this place my love fav place Rishikesh because of ram jhulla u live thus place my love....you feel to much beautiful & lovely... You through all the tension and relax.. Here. Very quit and lovely place must visit guys i love this place no words after you see you get my feelings about the place ram jhulla....
Place full of hustle bustle,This is suspension bridge connecting swargashram area with  Rishikesh. It is used by people moving on foot or by two wheelers. There is a market on both the sides of the bridge. In evening hours it looks beautiful with the lights.One must see the evening arti on the shatrughan ghat near the ramjhula taxi stand
Good view,"Motorbikes ply on this so folks walking to be careful. Main connectivity bridge. Interesting market at both ends. Religious importance as connects temples, can watch aarti from here. Best for evening walks and explore markets"
Trip,"Positioned in Muni Ki Reti, Ram Jhula is one of the most popular attractions of Rishikesh. This bridge was constructed later than the Laxman Jhula, in the year 1980. Both these bridges are quite similar in design and steel construction. Ram Jhula is placed a few miles downstream from Laxman Jhula and links Swarg Ashram on the western bank of River Ganga to the Sivananda Ashram on the eastern one.As you walk on the bridge, river Ganga gushes below with full force and you are surrounded by beautiful Himalayas. Let the cool breeze brush past your face. The bride is around 6 km northwards of the holy town. The bridge is also slightly bigger in length than Laxman Jhula. The total length of the bridge is 450 feet.On both the sides of the bridge are various temples as well as Ashram. There are markets too, selling incense books, books on religious and spiritual topics, idols of gods and goddess, key rings and other knick-knacks. Do not forget to capture the beautiful scenery in your cameras."
Keep Walking,Very nice to walk around. Two wheelers are allowed on the bridge which is a bit annoying because they honk a lot. The view from the bridge is breathtaking. You can see the clean and green Ganga flowing. After crossing the bridge you can sit near Ram ghat. Its a very peaceful place if there isn't much crowd.
Unforgettable Fire Ceremony on this side of the bridge,Amazing traditional aarti with authentic music and well organised. Spiritual and traditional. Perfect for fitting in with the locals.
Walking and People Watching,"The bridge areas are just fantastic for walking, people watching and shopping.  The food and the sites are worth every minute."
If not here then where ?,"The go to place in Rishikesh.if u can look past the the constant honking of vehicles and generally uninterested attitude of shopkeepers,it‚Äôs the place to roam.try to go into the nooks and crannies and u will find hidden gems..old temples,quaint shops..fun and enlightening."
Nice place to visit,In Rishikesh crossing of Ganga river on both the bridges gives good experience in life . There are number of view points .Now a days sometimes bridges are crowded
Driving through bridge was best. Must visit,I drove my bike accross the bridge. The area here is very quiet. The sound of river gives a sense of serenity. The road to this bridge get jammed easily.The lighting of the bridge made the place look awesome.
Nice landmark with a great view,"Ram Jhula is the 2nd impressive and important pedestrian bridge (next to Lakshman Jhula) crossing the Ganga. I highly recommend a walking tour, crossing both bridges and both sides along the Ganga with a lot of nice viewpoints along the route."
"Nothing as an ""Attraction""",Ram Jhula is a passage for pedestrians but all two wheelers ply on this and pose a threat to people. It has only photographic value and that too from a distance.
Wonderful ,"Ram jhula is a sort of landmark of Rishikesh and is used as a proverbial location map for ashramas , great views and temples . It's a cantilever bridge separating the two banks of Ganga river. The views in the evening with lights is worth every penny . Great views of the beautiful Ganga can be seen from this historic vantage point . Mostly crowded at any point of time of the day"
Awesome ,An awesome visit to Laxman Zhoola to cross the Ganges to visit temples on other side such as Geeta Bhawan or any Ashram.It‚Äôs gives a scenic view of both the sides and enjoy the cool breeze throughout the day.
Very good location,"The place is very beautiful & very lovely there is so many  places to visit and see many things .    It's very nice to see many Temple,s & many adventures is also available there like rafting & other  Just visiting once this beautiful place"
Worth a visit,"There is very little to do around the bridge, which itself is a relatively modern ""suspended bridge"" construction, built and maintained by the Government. The Laxman Jhula is a bit further away, and a smaller bridge, again  it is a modern construction."
Vacation time,Awesome Place for peace of mind. Every evening you can watch and take part in famous Ganga Aarti. You can relax on the banks of Ganga and take a dip in it. Must visit place of everyone. Ram Jhula is an iron suspension bridge across the river Ganga. There are many ashrams and religious centers established at both sides of the Ganges to pray and stay for pilgrims visiting the place.This is one of the major attractions of rishikesh. Ram Jhula can be very easily accessible by road as there are plenty of Auto-rickshaws which go that way. It is a rope bridge constructed on the mighty river Ganga flowing beneath. This unique bridge also supports small two-wheelers. And it is an amazing experience standing on the bridge swaying slightly due to the weight of the vehicles. The road from the Auto stand to the bridge is lined up with numerous shops selling different varieties of clothes and jewellery. The other side of the bridge has numerous ashrams and temples lined up.
A swinging affair,A pleasant experience. The walk on the bridge flanked by the Holy waters on both sides and the scenic view is breathtaking.
Great View from A Narrow Suspension Bridge,"Very important and ancient suspension bridge to cross river Ganga afoot. Motor-Bikes, scooters and pedal rickshaws are permitted to use this extremely narrow bridge, making it a nightmare for pedestrians to walk along. A ferry service available at the foot of the bridge is cheap, speedy and comfortable. The view of the grand and pious river Ganga from Raam Jhula is worth all the trouble to cross on the bridge. Very old and Important Ashrams and Temples are located on one side and Rishikesh city, some commercial establishments, Sivananda Hospital and few important Ashrams like Sivananda Ashram are all located on the other side; hence the traffic crossing across the river is ever increasing."
Sit by the Ganga,"Sit on the ghat, enjoy the breeze, look at the waters flowing swiftly by and just chill. You will feel a sense of serenity automatically descending on you. It's a wonderful feeling. You can also take a boat ride across the river and walk down to the Mahesh Yogi ashram where the Beatles stayed for a few weeks. That's also quite an experience."
Another Bridge,"Yes that's right, it's a bridge. A suspension bridge. A suspension bridge that goes from one side of the Ganges river to the other. Yip, it's s bridge."
Hanging Bridge offering great views,Beautiful and delightful. Amazing views on offer. 2 wheelers of all kinds on the bridge along with tourists and locals. Well made ghats around both banks of the Ganges. During the night its well lit and looks well as well. Definitely a must visit in Rishikesh.
Importance of Ram Jhoola,Previously there was only Laxman jhoola for connectivity between Rishikesh & Swargashram. For Swargashram area it is nearly two km walk from one end to another end. Another end is famous with Parmarth Nikaten & Geeta bhawan. Mostly people visits these places for Yoga n spiritual vicinity. Later government made Ram jhoola to make easy access to another end. Before bridge people using big motor boat to cross Ganga river.
One of the two bridges in Rishikesh,Definitely a must do. It‚Äôs very beautiful at night. All lit up and you can see Parmarth Niketan all lit up as well at night from the bridge. There are rows of shops once you cross the bridge.
A slice of real India on a suspension bridge,"Just Like Laxmanjhula, Ramjhula is also synonymous with Rishikesh. A hanging foot bridge over river Ganga, it gets pretty crowded during the busy time, with pedestrian, two wheelers and the omnipresent holy Cows!!But it really gives a vibe of local culture, a true spirit of religious India. The view of the river and the surrounding mountains are beautiful, and the markets on either side of the Jhula extremely interesting.For more stories on Devbhoomi Garhwal please visit my blog ramblersnaps.blogspot"
Ram Jhula ,"This is again an experience one can only experience. Its one of the most visited place in the whole rishikesh area, and it lives upto the reputation."
Love the view and the local vibes!,"Ram Jhula was painted the color of India‚Äôs national flag which makes it look stunning. The bridge is actually very small so you should be mindful of motorbikes passing by anytime. You will see local crowds there, it‚Äôs a great place to observe local‚Äôs life. And the souvenir shops around the area have nicer design and varieties. Good place to chill by the holy Ganga river, immerse yourself in the local crowds and shopping for souvenirs. Love it very much!"
Love the monkey gangs and Gangha,"Only in India would the backdrop of the Himalayan foothills and Ganga river be in full contrast with the cute yet aggressive local, urban conditioned monkeys."
Beautiful Views of Ganga and both banks,"Visited Feb 5 and 6. Beautiful views of the Ganga.  Interesting experince- motor scooters, tourists, locals, monkeys. Lots of stalls with shopping on either side.  Great experience."
nice walk around,"Built in 1980, Ram Jhula is one of the only two bridges that cross Ganga in Rishkesh. On both the sides of the bridge are various temples as well as Ashram. You can have a peaceful walk around the both areas, have coffee, enjoy the view."
Inspiring,I loved crossing this iconic bridge daily.The views are fantastic. The cafes in Ram Jhula are excellent.The people watching you can do is unbeatable. I will be visiting again.Guaranteed
Average,This bridge is almost a look alike of Lakshman Jhula however Lakshman Jhula is way better than this and you can understand the difderence by visiting.
Similar to lakshman jhula ,Ram jhula name is less famous than lakshman jhula but it has the same experience with mythological story of god ram and lakshman.
"Its so beautiful, you can even cross it using 2 wheeler.","Its well constructed, on the river Ganges, One can stand here and see the mesmerizing view of flowing Ganges."
The most crazy suspension bridge Ive ever crossed!,"The views from this bridge are amazing but sometimes crossing it isnt the easiest feat! You have to dodge other people, motorbikes, selfie takers, monkeys and cows crossing! We crossed the bridge several times in our three days in Rishikesh and once looked on from a temple where the foot traffic came to a congested stand still for about half and hour."
Great Location,Try a 360 degree view when you are river rafting in the serene Ganga Ji. Amidst mountains this is a fabulous point.
Beautiful bridge,Well constructed bridge and you can enjoy the Ganga flowing in its voracious speed. It's get crowded with two wheels.ita very narrow to walk.
Beautiful Bridge connecting the banks of Ganges,This is a lovely place to visit and see the Ganges gushing below. This bridge is less crowded than Lakshman Jhoola and is a lot more serene and quiet.
Nice Bridge across Ganga river,"Nice Bridge across Ganga river.... looks very good with lighting in the evening. They allow 2 wheelers in this small bridge, some time it creates jam and inconvenience."
Great experience ,Always a pleasure to walk over this... Try walking around when the water level is low you will be amazed by looking at the size and numbers of fishes eating food in running water.. It is a treat for eyes along with blast of fresh air.
Hanging bridge and identity of Rishikesh,"Rishikesh identity also comes with 2 hanging bridges - Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula. When someone in local says Rishikesh, it relates to Ram Jhula and the place near Laxman Jhula is called Tapovan. During daylight, Ram Jhula is very crowded and took time to cross. Taking photographs amidst the crowd is also a challenge. But, the green coloured Ganges flowing beneath makes it most pleasant to see from a height. At Ram Jhula, we walked across the the Ghat side - Ramjhola Ganga Ghat and spent 5-10 minutes."
Ram Jhula,"Situated nearby lakshman jhula, this bridge is bigger when compared with the lakshman jhula. Looks amazing when lit up in the night."
A walk on the bridge,Ram Jhula is situated next to the Sivananda ashram in Rishikesh. Before walking across to the other end it is a good idea to gaze at the serene Ganga flowing beneath and soak in the beautiful environment from a spot in the Ashram or from the ghat nearby.Walking on the Ram Jhula is a nice experience as you watch the perennial river flowing gently below.It's a walk on a bridge that you will not forget ever.
Sense of Freedom,"I enjoy slow walking at this area. Everyone greeting everyone, nice cafeteria and foods in this area, books shop and many others stuff . The sunset is beautiful and sitting beside the mystical Ganga river that is no words can express the feelings of the moment of peacefulness."
cleaner gangaji,this is most visited place in rishikesh. i loved the banks of gangaji. whole view of ram jhula was good.
Good place...,"Good view of sun rise... one can get a ride across the Ganges via ferry from Ram Jula... Ganges is really very beautiful & clean here, as well as deep... Ram Jula is much older than Lakshman Jula... it was built in 1930s... but properly kept & maintained... only problem is the allowance of 2 wheelers & other vehicles through this bridge, which interferes with  one's enjoyment of beauty of the Ganges & surrounding mountains..."
Hanging Bridge ,Peaceful Place numrouse visitor do visit here everyday. One of must visit place because maximum tourists attraction is either this side of the bridge either other side.It was fabulous visit of mine. Enjoyed real culture of Pahadi people.
This is one amazing hanging bridge,"It is a man-made bridge. It swings slightly due to the wind, you can feel it when passing through the bridge. The bridge looks spectacular and the surrounding view is also great. Other than this there is a temple and ashram. If you are visiting the temples and ashram be sure to take a good guide."
The place is wonderful,The place is really peaceful. It can be enjoyed all year around. Must visit if you are going there with family
Majestic & Inspiring,"Firstly the view from Sivanand Ashram is majestic and when you concentrate and observe silently and peacefully, it inspires you to follow a journey of evolving, from a stage of material and intelligence quotient, stepping into emotional Quotient and finally striving for Spiritual Excellence.. I could just sit on top at Govardhan Dham and ascend into discovering my inner and higher Self"
Nice view of Ganges and very,Ram Jhula is a nice walk in Rishikesh. You get the excellent view of ganges and can walk to Geetha Bavan. Taste the crispy Jalebi in Geetha bavan
Great way to cross ganga,Ram Jhula and laxman jhula are atleast 3 km apart and it is better to get off at ram jhula and enjoy rishikesh. Laxman jhula is for visual appeal of the rishikesh.
Ram jhoola,It is a suspended bridge across the river Ganges . Other side is parmarth Niketan ashram where in the evening their is lovely Aarti performed by young students with musical instruments.on the car parking side there are lovely shops of handicrafts and beautiful kurta and Kurtis and best of dresses for Ladies. Worth going.
Check out both sides,Both the Sivananda and Swarg sides of the bridge are filled with interesting shops and restaurants. It is definitely worth a visit.  Walks a bridge one-way dodging scooters and take the Riverferry the other way for a nice round-trip
Normal bridge connecting two ends of the river Ganges in Rishikesh,"Just a normal bridge connecting two ends of the river Ganges in Rishikesh & the chaos created by the honking & speeding two wheeler on the bridge is totally irritable experience,they two wheeler drivers just dont care about people walking on bridge which is meant for people & keep speeding,u need to be careful about the speeding ones & give side to these guys,not worth at all walking this one"
Holy peace ,Surrounded by mountain. And water is cold and clean. You can cross the river by jhula I liked the laxman jhula area more then ram jhula .
Nice ,Quite similar to the laxman jhula but on a smaller scale with less people and less confusion however still worth a visit
"It's not the destination, but the journey.",The location is great. But what I enjoyed most was the journey of walking by the bridge and the crowd. Being able to immerse yourself with the surrounding is really all about the culture and the people. Feel the colours and the friendliness of the people in India through the booths you'd pass by and the streets where they'd chat you up and share their insights with you (if you're willing to stop by). For those cultural spirits!
Beautiful ,What an experience The is a place where you will see India coming together. Culture and people from around India along with a lot of foreigners. This is a must visit place when going to Rishikesh. Try to avoid taking your vehicles and visit cafes in this area for the great food they serve very Holy place it‚Äôs true after been feel change of life
Bridge over the Ganges,"Truly remarkable engineering of this bridge that is always busy. Motor bikes jostle for space to try to cross the bridge to get accross the river. We chose to go accross by boat and walked back over the bridge, and stopped to take in the awe of Mother Ganga from the bridge."
A suspended bridge,It‚Äôs a suspended bridge joining the two parts of the hill across river ganga in Rishikesh. It joins swargashram with tapovan. I recommend one to wear comfortable shoes and cross it on foot.
Evening visit,"We visited Ram Jhoola in the evening , on our way to Parmarth aarti. The Jhoola was crowded, not helped by scooters and bikes, and their incessant honking. The Jhoola was not meant for that kind of crossing, and the authorities should do something about it."
Worth visit in evening time,"We had visited in late evening and its worth watching river gaga from top. And atmosphere which we had watched from besides of jula is memorable. And lighting from other side and clouds sets on river was so beautiful that i m not able to narrate it. In short it was too beautiful and memorable visit.There is market near bridge where you can buy verious types of products price rangeing from 10 to 5000. And market it very long it will take atleast one hour if you see only at each and every shop. There is taxi stand, auto rickshaw stand and also parking at end or starting of road."
Mixed experience,"The walk on jhoola was not so exciting because of two wheelers and traffic. However, found sitting on the ghats near the ram jhoola was nice. Enjoyed taking bath too."
Amazing structure bogged down by two wheelers,"First of all...out of the 2 cable bridges in Rishikesh, this is definitely the one to visit as it is much less crowded than the Laxman Jhula. It also provides excellent views of the river ghats.However the constant stream of errant two wheelers is annoying to say the least. I hope a rule is introduced to prevent two-wheelers from ruining the sanctity of this amazing structure."
The famous Bridge and the ghat view ,Ram Jhula is the new bridge (compared to Lakshman) which gives an amazing view of the Ganga ghats of Rishikesh connecting Muni Ki Reti. It's quite crowded at regular hours with two wheelers coming from both directions. Come early morning or late nights. Tip : Come here in the evening and also at night. Both views are amazing.
Awesome location,Ram Jhula is the new of the two bridges in Rishikesh. Normally used by tourist to come to parmarth Niketan for Aarti or for eating in the famous food joints like chotiwala. Also you can enjoy sitting on the banks of the river close to the bridge.You can cross the Jhula walking or take a boat to cross the river
Oldest Cable Bridge but too narrow to accomdate Two Wheeler and Pedastrians,"One of the Oldest Cable Bridge. View near Ram Jhula is scenic. Ghats near Ram Jhula are nice for baths in Ganga. Bridge is too narrow and though both two wheeler and Pedastrians pass on it. Difficult for tourists to stand for few minutes as too crowdy. Bridge is connecting one part of Rishikesh with Geeta Bhavan, Swagashram etc. There are several shops of local products sold on the way to bridge. Geeta Bhavan has also counter for selling cloths and other products."
"Nice to cross, but busy and more functional ","Nice to cross for the view, but the bridge is very busy (with a scooters) so not a relaxt place and more functional. The bridge is a main road to cross the river. Many shops, restaurants, temples and ceremonies are located at the other side of the river and the 'normal' road is very much longer (no option). Although nice to cross for t mee view and visit the Ganga both sides."
Ram Jhula the famous suspension bridge!,"Ram Jhula,is one of the main attractions of world's yoga capital - Rishikesh! It is a suspension bridge, which was built over the River Ganges in the year 1986. It has great view of the Ganges river! The bridge is full of live daily! Take your time to stroll around here take lots of pics! And enjoy all the savoury available around the vicinity!"
Breathtaking view of Ganga ma,"View of ganga ma from this jhula/bridge is simply can't be explained in words , although ferry is available if you want to travel ."
"Bridges, the Unique elements of Rishikesh","Ram jhula is the bridge connecting the opposite banks of the Ganga in Rishikesh. Our driver dropped us near the steps. The steps were quite steep and we saw the elderly struggle down the same to reach the bridge. One can cross the bridge , take some pics. On the other side there were a couple of temples and ashrams."
Ram Jhula (Rishikesh),"Rishikesh has got a charm in itself. Temples, water sports, hiking, Beatles Ashram, Yoga, Meditation etc... Standing on this Ram Jhula gets you an amazing view of the River Ganga. This place is located in the state of Uttrakhand and at a drive of 5 hrs from Delhi"
must visit place in Rishikesh,"its a one of the main attraction place for tourists in Rishikesh , its a midly shaking suspension bridge."
"""Once u are in the middle, just close your eyes and take a deep breath and fill the pure riverside oxygen in ur lunghs""","Slightly undulated ancient bridge which helps people, cattle and two wheelers to cross. Saves lot of miles of travel and connects North Hrishikesh to south. South of the Hrishikesh is known as tapobhoomi, as many sadhakas were doing Japa, Tapa and various sadhanas right from the ancient time as this place was untouched by outsiders. A nice place for selfie!! :)"
Serene place,Place has a certain serenity with river flowing underneath a mildly shaking suspension bridge. Enjoy the breeze
Awesome,"It connects Muni Ki Reti to Swargashram area. Nice scenic view from here. After crossing it, there are lots of food options available, famous Chotiwala restaurant is also there. Some clean Ganga Ghats are also there specially Geeta Bhavan ghat."
Very crowdy,Very crowded. Lots of two wheeler vehicle and cows. Difficult to walk. And also people clicking photos and selfie make more difficult to cross.
A place not to miss,"I liked Ram Jhula more than Laxman jhula because of the ghats and the views, and less crowd. Serene."
Nice Place,It is also same as laxman jhula. Bridge is maintained superbly even local people riding  bikes and cycle over this bridge.
"Ram Jhula, Rishikesh","It is a 70 yr old suspension bridge across the Ganges connecting the southern to northern side,where many famous Ashrams like Sivananda are located.Nice place for Selfies n beautiful view!"
The swinging bridge !!,Crossing this bridge you can see the Ganges flowing though at some places its covered with plastic net.
Great views,"The views from this bridge were great. But that's about it. It was overcrowded pushing against each other. In addition to that, motorbikes and scooters are allowed to move on this narrow footbridge which adds to the pain."
Very famous Jhula,This is one of the famous attraction in Rishikesh. This Jhula is on holy river Ganga. View from Jhula is very beautiful.
Crowded spot,"Rishikesh was crowded, hot and humid during my travel to this place. But had a great Darshan here. Please do not miss it"
Engineering Dime at Holy Site,"We went to Ram Jhula as first attraction when we arrived at Rishikesh. A good engineering example at holy site. some were even using two-wheeler to cross over the bridge. To be true to words, Ram jhula offers a good view of river Ganga, a slow wind over the bridge and a location for photography. This cultural landmark is auspicious and energetic point. must visit."
Nice,The jhula is too nice and cool.But due to huge traffic on small pathway of Ram Ghula it is hard to explore.
I love Rishikesh,I visit Rishikesh last month and Ramjhula best place in Rishikesh. Near market is very good and the bridge very long and old. Love ashram near bridge and shops.
"Lively place for Yoga, Ganga visit, and shopping","Visited Ram Jhula almost daily during my stay at Rishikesh to drink freshly squeezed sugarcane juice, and visit Ganga."
A famous Landmark,"Ram jhula is a iron suspension bridge over river Ganga, it is situated approx 3 km north-east from the town Rishikesh."
Different feelings at different hours of a day.,"Built in the year 1986, one of the iconic landmarks of City, Ram Jhula is 750 ft. long iron suspension bridge over river Ganga with no pillars; connecting Ashrams located in Muni Ki Reti to Gita Bhawan, Parmarth Niketan and other temples located in Swargashram. Ram Jhula is similar in design, but bigger than Lakshman Jhula. Early morning visit is recommended. From the bridge, one can witness/feel vibration of bridge, soothing sound of river and panoramic view of hills, ashrams, ghats, people enjoying rafting/boating.During day & evening, one HAS to witness monkeys, cows, dogs, honking bikes, beggars and ‚Äòn‚Äô number of people taking selfies. It may be bit scary for persons having height phobia. Beware of monkeys; they can snatch your belongings in a wink. There are shops/stalls on both sides of bridge selling religious/spiritual books, key rings, idols etc. In night, there are less lights; but the feel of river and fresh air make it worth a visit at night.In nutshell, different feeling at different hours of a day."
Good place.,This is near laksham jhula. Good place to see if you are in the twin city of haridwar and rishikesh. Avoid going on 1st monday of Shrawan. There will be too much crowd.
Good memories,"When inreached Raam jhula,  i shocked first time I seen like jhula through river it's great memory to me.i can't forget this in my life."
ram jhula,being sawan month full of crowd. heavy traffic. traffic poorlymanaged due to unexceptional croud of sawan 1st monday
Foot bridge across the River Ganga,"An experience of India not to be missed. Ganges flowing swiftly below, the ashrams and ghats in full view, the shops selling local merchandise, music & typical indian kitch real time."
Second Best To Only One,"Built as a second option (or a belated twin) to Lakshman Jhula, it is amongst one of the most popular attractions for most tourists in Rishikesh.Tsctically built almost 3-4 kms before Lakshman Jhula, this younger suspension bridge is also a lifeline for almost every visitor who wishes to cross over between Tehri and Pauri sides of the Ganga. Its also placed closer to the Rishikesh main road, with many small ghats, shops  and street vendors lining up the approach road. A great place for street shoppers - provided you are a shrewd bargainer."
Smaller than Laxman Jhula,A suspension bridge to cross the mighty Ganges. The whole area is a beauty to experience. Do spare your evenings for a stroll and a bit of shopping may be...
Bridge connecting banks of holy Ganges,"Ram Jhula connects both the banks of the Ganges, similar to the Lakshman Jhula situated 2 km away. The bridge per se is very narrow and only humans, bikes and cows are allowed. The bridge vibrates most of the time and you can feel the bridge moving. Make sure to accompany elder person in this bridge as they may need help when cows or bikes roam the bridge.The best part is the beautiful view of the mighty Ganges flowing in its full might below. The view and experience is indescribable!"
A very important reference point in Rishikesh,"Be careful with the bikes! Ram Jhula is an important reference and access point to the Swarg Ashram area of Rishikesh. Also because of this, the bridge is always full of people and bikes crossing it both sides. It's common to see monkeys on the Swargashram side of it, so be careful with your bananas! :) Enjoy Rishikesh!"
Glorious Ganga by suspension bridge,"When visiting Rishikesh (near Geeta Bhawan) the bridge upstream from the main village is here.  It is called Ram Jhula.  It is an absolute must see.  The view from here is increab!  You can see Ganga Maa sa la la upstream, downstream you can see a curve in the banks of the river.  The bridge is constantly visited by monkey families and cows.  The cows and even bulls are generally gentle and blend in with the crowd.  The monkeys, not so much.  Take caution not to have food in your hands and to have your valuables well stowed or you may just be held up by a monkey!  This is where the Ganges leaves the Himalaya and starts her journey into the plains of India.  A magical spot.  If you time it right (evening hours)  you can even be serenaded by the monks from the Hare Krsna Temple, singing beautiful bhajans!"
If you have extra time,"The bridge is very crowded.. and also taking pictures on the bridge is not allowed. Bridge does swing/vibrate while you are on it. You can get shared auto from the market. You wont miss anything if you are not able to visit it. But i think if you are nearby,you should at least visit one bridge either ram jhula or lakhshaman jula."
Great Shopping,"THE BEST place to shop for malas, jewelry and statues is Neelkanth Gems. Owner Sanjeev will always greet you with a big smile and tell you ""sit, sit."" In addition to the amazing amount of stock showing, he has much tucked away: real gems, more malas than anywhere in town, tons of statues, lots of jewelry (stone,silver). A certified gemologist and real rock hound, he has a rock shop upstairs as well, and has forgotten more about rocks and stones than most other shopkeepers know.  Have been shopping there since 2012!!"
Bridge across the River Ganga ,"Locals and tourists use it to get across the river , Two wheelers are also allowed , nice view of the river , has a nice temple with a beautiful Shiva statue just down the road ,"
Okey,Holiday mood everywhere so crowd is expected everywhere. Bridge over river ganges to go to other side is nice. It swings when you walk
ram jhula,"Ram Jhula is a useful pedestrian bridge across the Ganga to connect both the sides. Since this has been made recently, I wish it had been made wider. It is extremely crowded. Motorcycles and bicycles should not be allowed on this Jhula. The approach through  steps from the road is risky with broken steps and missing railings at various points."
A disaster waiting to happen,"Crossing the Ram Jhula was pretty traumatic. There are milling crowds, two - wheelers, and cows crossing at the same time. One cow also did a U turn and decided to go back. The worst is the people who try and take selfies against the backdrop of the Ganges. I was praying that I cross safely but the worst was yet to come. The exit is very narrow and at one end leads into a crowded market place. I started praying again and took my next breath only when I exited the market place.A nightmare and there is really zero pleasure that I envisaged about walking high over the Ganges. I feel sorry for the police who man the bridge given that people are openly hostile and disrespectful to them given that the poor guys are only trying to do their jobs."
Second monument built across the river Ganges,It is similar to Lakshman Jhula & this overlooks the route to Char Dham. It is very crowded & hardly one gets a chance to click long shot of the bridge with only their dear ones.
One time experience,"Just go there to calm down your excitement. this is nothing like a attraction point, instead this is a bridge who connects two point, Which people use. People drives in it which must stop immediately and this make life difficult for walkers."
New attraction in Rishikesh,Rishikesh was famous for rope bridge Laxman Tula. Now another bridge Ram zula. This is similar to Laxman Zula and the bridge swings as pilgrims walk on it. One should visit in the evening so you can see the beautiful lighting for the bridge as you approach it.
Sweet little adventure!,"Love to be on Ram jhula, my daughter was so excited that she crossed it 4 times without stopping just to have that experience! :) it shakes when u walk on it n thats why its really a Jhula and not just a bridge. In evening u wud love it more when u get to see everything lightened around u. The only negative is that bikes are allowed on the jhula so it really becomes crowded and creates a nuisance for those who walk. It connects the two market streets across river."
Okayish ,"The Jhula is okay, but the surroundings are very dirty. The local authorities should do some effort to clean the place up."
Not a bridge but a SWING,As you walk across the bridge it shakes and so the name is given jhula n not bridge... Loved walking through it as no photography was allowed on the bridge as it is the peak season there was too much rush on the Ram jhula so for maintaining traffic such notices were written
Most happening place in Rishikesh.,"The bank under Ram Jhula is safe for bathing. The market starting from Ram Jhula has a great market where traditional clothes, and gift itesm can be purchased at decent budgets or cheap. Snacks also available easy. This is Rishikesh chowpatty overall."
bigger and busier then laxman jhula,traffic chaos rules supreme in high seasons where two wheelers and pedestrians compete in crossing it first..however this gets a check when cops forbid 2 wheelers from 6 pm till 9pm or turn it into one way
Bridge to Swarg (Heaven) Ashram,Ram Jhula is a suspension bridge used by pedestrians to go to Swarg AShram from Rishikesh side and same way ascetics from that side come to take conveyance to the Char Dham yatra. It gives a superb view from the bridge. It is narrow but a modern bridge and very essential. Cool breeze experienced on this while crossing and the scenic beauty is worth expereincing.
Religious outing,It was a nice Sunday spent enjoying the local Bazaar . Parking is a big issue but expensive paid parking available.
The twin of Laksman Jhula,"Same bridge crossing Gangga just as Laksman Jhula which is located about 1km from Laksman Jhula. Narrow, but not as congested as Laksman Jhula I think. And nearby of the bridge there are some beaches which is nice for a relax time, also shops selling souvenirs."
A bridge not too far,"Ram and Laxman jhoolas are suspended bridges which sway with wind and loading. Ram jhoola is narrow and with 2 wheelers allowed it is crowded and risky. But you must walk over it !We walked across to reach Choti wala restaurant , which is at far end of Ram jhoola"
Amazing Bridge built on wires,"It was great experience to visit this old wire bridge at Ganga River.  Though the bridge was narrow, people, cattles and even bikers were using it.Also visit Laxman Jhula nearby"
it is gr8 view,this is a life time experience for me and i am very much interested to go this place again and again river rafting was awesome and living in Tents are a new experience for me
inconvenient for pedestrians,"it is inconvenient for pedestrians, especially the old,  to walk on this bridge since two wheelers are also allowed on it."
Just like Lakshman Jhula,Ram Jhula is just like the Lakshman Jhula. It's a nice walk but again quite crowded with motorcycles & cows on the bridge.
Swing while walking,"Ram Jhula is awesome, we would have gone on it 3-4 times to go across to the other side of river Ganga. It is beautifully lit up in the evening and looks amazing. Watching the flow of ganga from the bridge is lovely. Only drawback is the two wheelers and those pestering scooters and motor bikes on the bridge while you are walking, they constantly honk and are all around you while you are walking. Had it been restricted only to pedestrians it would have been great."
A decent walk but avoidable during peak tourist season,One would rather take the boat across the river instead of walking on the Ram Jhula. It's a nice walk no doubt but during peak tourist season it's better avoided as you get a feeling on walking on a local railway overbridge Too many people pushing and jostling around makes it a tad bit suffocating.Overall depends entirely on the time you choose to walk on this marvel of engineering. The earlier say during sunrise would be ideal.
same as laxman pull,hanging pull and yes it has the same situation like the laxman jhula where there is a lot of jam created due to bikes
Mesmerizing view,The walk on the ram jhula is very enchanting with the Ganges flowing below and the clear sky above. We would stop after some steps and see the boats and rafting activity in the ganges.We enjoyed at the ram jhula and also a lot of colourful shops from the ram jhula parking .
Too crowded,It's a suspension bridge across the river Ganga. Gets too crowded all the time with cycles and two wheelers.
Nice Place,"When you are in Rishikesh, it is bound to visit Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula. It is very crowded but a wonderful experience."
Good one,F Ram Jhula is just like lakshman Jhula we were told n hence we just saw the ram Jhula. Request u to take a guide here who will charge just 100rs. Only then u understand d importance of the temples here else they will just be mere temples. Heard some great stories about d pandavas after kurukshetra war.
Must see,"As famous as d Lakshman Jhula is the Ram Jhula. Since this suspension bridge is little away from Tapovan(most popular area in Rishikesh), it's not that crowded. U can easily take ur two wheelers on this bridge. It's an amazing experience to pass through this suspension bridge connecting two opposite sides of Rishikesh, overlooking d Ganga River. An unbelievable experience"
Great View,"Walking on this bridge gives you stunning view of the ghats, especially of the Ganges flowing below as well as of Paramarth Niketan. But two wheelers coming on the bridge really irritates."
The main Place of Rishikesh,"Ram Jhula is main place of Rishikesh, located at Price location with many Ganga Ghats, Temples and Market. In night the view becomes amazing. This is a must visit with nearby locations."
First hanging bridge before Laxman Jhula....,"We actually pitched tent near Ram jhula and stayed for a night. First time staying in tent with my wife and kid and near ganga river, ram jhula, experience was unforgettable. At night they turn lights on for sometime on jhula, which looks beautiful."
Visited at night. Nice view.,"Great to take a stroll. Nice views. Parking charges are huge i.e. 150 as compared to Rs. 50 at laxman jhula. However, this is more approachable as compared to laxman jhula."
The other side of Rishikesh ,"This is my fav spot of my month in Rishikesh, ashrams, Ganga river, mountains, monkies and the beautiful market.We attended the Ganga Arti here, close to Shiva statue. Don't miss it!"
Nice to walk in the evenings,You can see the river ganga flowing below the bridge. good to walk early morning & evening. Beware of cycles & scooters on the bridge.
Enchanting Jhula,"View of the Ram Jhula from Shatrugan Ghat was mesmerizing at night, as lights were litted up. The reflection of the same in the river Ganga was breathtaking."
Not the same as Laxman Jhula,"For me, Ram Jhula is not at all the same as Laxman Jhula. It feels like many other Indian religio-tourist towns. That's not to say you should avoid it. There are shops, restaurants and ghats, and of course Ashrams."
Good,"In day time, walk around visiting temples on either side, do some trinket shopping, have south Indian food in Madras cafe, enjoy brownies on the cafes, have lunch at Chotiwala, settle down in ashrams in the evening. Enjoy ganga aarti of Parmarth Niketan on one side or the Shatrughan Ghat on the other side. Watch rafters return to rishikesh base in the evening. a Nice experience."
Literally Jhula,It shakes as you move over the bridge. my daughter got scared and wanted to run back to the starting of the bride. The problem I feel is the two wheeler which also cross the river using this bridge. Its in a way reducing the life of the bridge.
Awesome Ram Jhula,"Visited Rishikesh first time, heard lots about Laxman Jhula since my childhood, but when seen Ram Jhula specially at night (24th April) then we forgot everything, it was mind blowing experience, spent lots of time by sitting at Gangas bank alongwith spouse."
Iconic structure ,Ram Jhula is an iconic road cantilever bridge which connects the two banks of river Ganga in the holy city of Rishikesh. One can enjoy a panaromic view of the upper climbs of the mountains on one side with river Ganga flowing in its own pristine beauty and downstream Ganga waters on the other . The only irritation is constantly passing two wheelers blaring horns and disturbing the walking people . I hope they construct another bridge which can be used solely by two wheelers
Good view of Ganga from the Ram Jhula,Ram Jhula connecting both ends of the Ganga is example of technology and from this place a good view of ganga is seen amongst the heavy wind webs
Do visit here if you come to Rishikesh ,Ram Jhula is also a major attraction of tourists in Rishikesh. This is an iron suspension bridge that connects Shivananda Ashram and Swargashram. This bridge give panoramic view of the holy river Ganges and the temples situated nearby.
Ram Jhoola - a connection,"While people talk a lot about this bridge and Lakshman Jhoola but they do not seem to have a mythological connection with the fact that these bridges are manmade. its a hanging bridge over the river Ganga and connects the lands of both sides. There are two modes of transportation - By Boat or via Ram and Lakshman Jhoola.The crowd on the bridge seems consistent and throughout as no one would prefer to pay for the boat to cross the river. While some visitors prefer a walk from one to another end, the crowd mostly consist of the local population for their daily commute. It was a good experience but not something which will wow or thrills anyone in a certain way.The bridge is not only used by the foot walkers but also by the riders. My expectations were not met as I had heard a lot from people but eventually realized that the bridge does not connect the sensor to the era we imagine when we hear the name of the bridge. I won't recommend it as a must visit but a can be visited spot."
ram jhula.,ram jhula is just a bridge and on the end of the bridge are small shops .I wouldn't recommend it but if on the way then do visit.
a busy place!,"This is the wider of the two bridges but equally as congested. It is busy throughout the day with people stopping to take photos, bikes and scooters trying to push their way through. Monkeys on the lookout for food and cows, large and small crossing or resting ready to finish crossing. It all makes for an interesting but safe crossing."
Bridge on Ganga,"This bridge connects main road to other side of the ganga ghat. There is rush on bridge especially at evening time, have some patience!! One should visit parmarth niketan, geeta bhavan across the river."
Wonderful Hanging Bridge,The bring over the river Ganga is so wonderful. The bridge is always shaking due to lots of people passing over it
connecting bridge,Its a narrow bridge connecting from the city approach to the main market across ganga and lands very near the Ganga Aarti ghat
Beautiful Iron Suspension Bridge,"Ram Jhula in Rishikesh is one of the most famous attractions here for tourists. Built in 1986 it is a Suspension Bridge and connects the two famous ashrams, the Sivanand Ashram and Swarg Ashram over the river Ganges. It is less popular and lesser crowded than its sibling The Laxman Jhula. It is also little wider and is spanned across around 200+ meters on Ganges.Ideal time to visit is in early morning or in the evening when there is lesser local traffic. For non-Indians it may seem chaotic as all kind of people including vehicles and animals pass this bridge. A cow sitting idle on the bridge may seem scary for them but its all part of the life here. A good location for some serious photography can be found on the bridge with rafters sailing below the bridge on the river. A definite visit to experience this spiritual extravaganza which is displayed here."
Amazing,Amazing ..everyone should visit once..i will come back with my friends and i will take them to ram jhula ..
A trip not complete without crossing this bridge,"Beautiful views of Ganga, the mountains, Sivananda Ashram and Swarg Ashram,  Be careful of the motorcycles, Watch people feeding the fish"
Your gateway to Rishikesh ,"Ram Jhula has the larger Taxi rank of the two Bridges, and taxis prefer to take you here. Ram Jhula is ‚Äúa little‚Äù quieter than Laxman. Less shopping options but some interesting places to see. Take a boat across the Ganga to the Ashram/temple shopping side of the river. Iyengar Yoga Studio near the Taxi parking. Hotels."
take a boat trip,"Instead of crossing the Ram Jhula, you might decide to cross Laxman Jhula on foot. Rather take a boat ride acorss the river (Rs 10 per person on shared boat) to have the best view of Rm Jhula"
Ram Jhula is a famous landmark place in Rishikesh city.,Ram Jhula has the length of 450 feet connecting Shivananda Ashram with Swargashram.Ram Jhula is placed a few miles downstream from Laxman Jhula
Awesome views .....,"The Ram Jhula is larger and wider than the bridge I crossed earlier (Lakshman Jhula) today, but provides a passage for locals, tourists, carts, and motorbikes. Both bridges have movement, but nothing scary.  You can find small shops on both sides, so bring your spending money.  I carry small currency denominations for tips, offerings, and local transportation.  For something different, we crossed the river by a local ferry for people.  Offered another view of the bridge from below.  Hope this helps for your first visit.  I love the Indian people."
Ram Jhula,This is around 4-5 kms from Triveni Ghat. If you visit Ram Jhula at night then its lit with beautiful lights and the view is amazing. You got famous chotiwala restaurant also nearby. So walk upto Ram Jhula and then feast on some good food at Chotiwala restaurant.
A beautiful place,It's actually a beautiful and scenery place ti visit The water was so beautiful. It just can be quite annoying when all those motorcycles cross the bridge but overall it's good
Icon,This is one of the icon place in Rishikesh. Its super crowded and not comfortable to pass on it. It connects between 1 market to the other. At night light will be up and its good to take pictures with those background.
Lighted bridge!,"It was amazing to see lights on a bridge hanging over a wide, roaring river. Both ram and Laxman jula are must-visit places in Rishikesh"
Only two bridge,I visited this place with my family.there is nothing to see.only there are two bridge on the Ganga river.many foreign ng tourist visit this place.but the scenery make you feel quite good.but nothing to see.at this place the mini bazar established.if you want to buy something for your relative you get that thing in mini bazar.if you free time in Rishikesh then go there.thank you
Similar to Laxman Jhula,It is same as Laxman Jhula. Every day thousands of people cross the Bridge. You can also cross it on your 2 wheelers.
Ram Jhula Centre of Rishikesh,"We couldn't miss Ram Jhula staying in Rishikesh and its a major hub for spiritualism, pilgrimages, yoga festival, aarti ghat and food and learning. As a traveler it is a place for rejuvenation of the self, the place is vegetarian, religious and there is lots of harmonizing activities around this area like Ayurveda, books around all these areas, Vedic astrology and food."

One of the best places to visit and even better if you can capture sunset from there.,"When staying in rishikesh, you will have to definitely visit this, One of the historic as well as one of the beautiful bridges"
A beautiful suspended bridge across River Ganga,This bridge is much larger and broader when compared to lakshman Jhula. We have to cross over the bridge to go to Parmarth Niketan where the Aarthi for Ganga takes place in the evening. The bridge is nice and vibrates on movement of two wheelers over it.  But  it is manageable as it is broader when compared to the other one. it is a pleasant walk on the bridge which has many shops on both end roads
Close to the aarthi ceremony,"This is the closest bridge to the aarthi ceremony at Parmath Niketan Ashram. Inevitably, there's a market close by and some reasonably good local restaurants too."
A view from the river,"Much larger (and perhaps not as pretty) as Lakshman Jhula, I saw this iconic Rishikesh bridge from the river as I crossed Ma Ganga by ferry."
A mix between Rishikesh town and Laxman Jhula,It is less touristic than Laxman Jhula but it still has a good infrastructure for tourism and also has some real indian life like Rishikesh town.
"nice location and good experience of ram juhla, when we walk on jhula ,its shake slightly.",nice to see ram jhula. its a unique bridge on ganga river. can see the flow of the river from jhula. nice architecher of jhula
Still some local features and affordable prices,The market area around Ram Julla is vibrant and prices are more reasonable than Laxman Julla. You can cross to the other side by paying 10 rupees for the boat and you can avoid the traffic jam on the bridge :)
A Lovely Quiet Bridge,"This bridge is across from Laxman Jhula.  It is quiet and leads to a quiet path in the countryside. The energy is soft, a lovely experience."
Crowded,"I was staying near Ram Jhula, so had to cross it a few times. crowded with 2 wheelers, people and some monkeys. Got some nice photographs of the river and Rishikesh from Ram Jhula."
Great place but highly crowded ,The place is a great example of architecture but highly crowded. The worst thing is that even two wheelers are allowed on this place. The paid parking near ram jhula is of rs. 150. Too high.
Ram jhula,Ram jhula a wonderful bridge over the river Ganges. Walk over the bridge is very nice looking to the bottom of river Ganges
Good place for shopping!,"The bridge itself doesn't have anything special, but on both sides you can go for a walk and find lots of small, cheap shops for your souvenirs and clothes"
Lovely Bridge,"Ram Jhula provides a good link between the banks of the River Ganges. One enjoys crossing the iron-suspension bridge. There are hundreds of local people as well as tourists crossing the bridge. One can feel the power and essence of the Ganges River as one crosses the bridge. The only downside is that motorcycles and bicycles are allowed to use the bridge, which poses a safety hazard to the pedestrians. Hope something is done to improve this situation."
Long bridge over the Ganga,Ram Jhula  connects the city to the area which has multiple temples. It is much longer than Lakshman Jhula. Only pedestrians and bikes are allowed on this bridge and it gets very dark after sunset as there are no street lights. You can just pass by this bridge while going for Ganga Aarti. Nothing so great to see as such.
Beautiful place to visit,"Good place to visit and walk on,  great view but vehicles are allowed on the jhula which creates nuisance."
Beautiful bridge,Iconic bridge on river Ganga. One gets a beautiful view of the mighty Ganga and Rishikesh city from the bridge. There is a nice ghat on the Ganga and other old temples and places of interest are also located near the Ram Jhula.
Nice Location with Hanging Bridge,"Great location, you can directly reach ganga water from the ghat. Picteresque location. You will get shared jeep, 10 rs/person, from lakshman jhula to this location. Lot of photography is recommended"
RAM JHULA,Ram Jhula is situated adjecent to lakshman Jhula.  This is also like lakshman Jhula.  When somebody walk on it feels like we are taking the swings.its moving in the air
best attraction of rishikesh,"This bridge is the next one after lakshman jhoola. This bridge provides connectivity to the main market full of cafes and ashrams, Again one needs to be cautious of the monkeys"
Average ,Not an attraction id recommend as there's nothing special there..  It's crowded.. Good for a one-time visit..
Scenic place ,Good view. Number of shops are there nearby for shopping. Various restaurants are there which offer varieties of food.
Beautiful ,"Ram is beautiful, walking on a suspension bridge is always fun, there is enough space for everyone there, pedestrians, bike, cows every one was there, view of Maa Ganga is beautiful"
Beautiful!,I visited last year and this is a suspension bridge with people walking and two wheelers plying on it. I loved the view from this bridge. It's built on a river. One feels very calm here.
Walk on the swinging bridge ,I will say better than Laxman Jhula as it is more wider and less crowded. Walk on this bridge from west to east to reach Swargashram Not to be missed
Get a good view crossing the Ganges,Take a stroll over the bridge and admire the Ganges below. Just be careful as some time there are motorcyclist who use the bridge too.
Good architecture ,Another excellent engineering architecture in rishikesh. Very near to parmarth Niketan and Geeta Bhawan. Shops are available nearby.
Ram Jhula!!! ,The Ram Hula bridge was too good. The river view was superb and fantastic. We went to this place early morning.
A very eventful bridge,"Imagine this - second day in India, first time crossing the narrow bridge to find accommodation on foot thinking this is simply a foot bridge across the Ganga.. you then find yourself wedged between an oncoming two-wheeler, people and a cow. Carrying all your worldly possessions, the cow takes a shine to you and drops its head (with horns) and picks up pace coming towards you - what do you do?Luckily a more experienced local moved me out of the way and I was able to continue crossing the bridge. - what a way to land in Rishikesh.Two days later whilst crossing in the heat of the midday sun, I decide to pick up an ice lolly before crossing the bridge. My extremely wise girlfriend advised 'I wouldn't eat that going across here' thinking she was joking, I ignored here advise - how wrong I could have been.  with around 10 meters remaining on the bridge I was surrounded by around 10 monkeys who took a fancy to the ice lolly. Initially I froze, then tried to ignore them. It was at this point they smelt weakness. One hairy monkey grabbed hold of my arm, I screamed, threw the ice lolly and ran - much to my girlfriends amusement.There you go - one very eventful bridge.. would recommend."
Walk across the bridge and sit beside the Ganga,"We walked across the Ram Jhula on a sunny winter morning. We came across people from different lands, mendicants, shops selling all kinds of things, ashrams, and a mobile bakery that sells warm cookies. All beside the Ganges. A 2 km walk takes you to the ruins of the Maharishi Ashram, made famous by The Beatles. It was a great, relaxing experience.In the evening an arati is conducted on the river bank by the Parmarth ashram. Worth attending.You meet a lot of fellow travellers on this path, and it is a must-do when you are in Rishikesh."
Spiritual visit,A bridge above Ganga Ji which is allowed for 2 wheelers so it is very crowded and hard to click pics. There are a nearby market and boat ride facility which takes 15rs per person both sides ( can go to fill water of Ganga Ji from the middle).You need to park your car while going for this Jhula and parking rate is high 150rsThere is no fees to visit the Jhula
Ram Jhula a must visit,"I love this place, it's lively, busy, and at times hectic, but I wouldnt have it any other way.  It's a must see for anyone visiting Rishikesh for the first time.  At first it can be quite overwhelming, especailly if its busy, but once you get through the crowd, the river is astouding, and the sunsets heavenly."
Gem of rishikesh,It's a historic slightly swinging jhula connecting one end of the holy river Ganga to another. Provides great view of river Ganga and scenic beauty around.
Good for Walk. Aarti & Market Area nearby,"We reached Ram Jhula from Lakshman Jhula area by Vikram (6-seater autorickshaw). We were charged Rs 20 per person. However the correct fare is Rs 5 or Rs 10 max. It dropped us on the main road itself & we had to walk to reach the bridge. There is market near the bridge. However we found the market to be expensive - compared to Lakshman Jhula or Triveni Ghar market. You will find many shops offering Rafting & other Adventure activities. Our rafting was included in our Adventure Camp stay itself, so we didn't check out Rafting/Adventure Camp options here. This bridge is a bit bigger than Lakshman Jhula & walk on it is a good experience. However 2-wheelers are allowed on this bridge as well & hence you will hear horn sound regularly. Shatrughan Ghat is near it - where Ganga Aarti happens in the evening. You get a good view of Ganges & this bridge from Shatrughan Ghat. If the bridge was illuminated at night, then the view would have been more beautiful at night. Parmarth Niketan Ashram is another famous place near this bridge - where Ganga Aarti happens & is very famous for Aarti as well as Yoga. Another famous Ashram nearby it is Swarg Ashram. Restaurants (Chotiwala at the Ganges) & snacks joints are also nearby. Good to visit once"
The best place to be in Rishikesh,"Its just not about the Ramjhula alone but its about the 2.5 km stretch spread across the banks of the holy river Ganga. This bridge connects the two banks of the river having some ancient and great great places of spirituality (Ashrams). On the one side you have the Devine life society or the Siva nand ashram and on the other side there stands the Parmarth Ashram and Swargashram. The serene places of yoga, wisdom and peace. The parking space near the jhula is good enough to park your cars or taxis (a bit costly at rs 150/- for a few hrs only) and from there you can start your walk. Crossing the Sivanand ashram then walking pass through the Hanging bridge over the clean and sparkling Ganga towards the Parmarth Ashram is a walk to remember. Enjoy the evening arti at Parmarth Ashram. Reach there by 5 pm to get a proper seat to experience the best of the Arti. Eat at Chotiwala with a 180¬∞ view of the river. There are many other budding cafes and joints near this place which can be explored. Better to go without your own vehicles. Bike can be a good ride. Find a seat on the banks of the river and spend your evening in peace."
Good narrow bridge ,It's a good attraction to visit once but vehicles create lot of pollution. Not well maintained and illuminated.
Good place to walk around,the ram jhula is very good place to walk around. There are lot of shopping options. The best restaurants of rishikesh are around this jhula. you can buy some fish food and food them from   jhula.
Oscilating bridge,"This is also a very old bridge established to cross the river, Ganga. If you stand in the middle of the bridge that you can feel that the bridge is actually oscillating. this is an amazing feeling."
Bigger suspension bridge,"This bridge is bigger than the Lakshman Jhula and so it is called the Ram Jhula. Like Lakshman Jhula, it aids in connecting the two sides of River Ganga. River Ganga can be seen flowing calmly below. Walk on the bridge was peaceful except for the haunting of two wheelers. Great engineering work to build the bridge."
Not much to be excited about,"Sure the bridge is old and for its time, it could have been a great thing. But, in today's world, I don't thing it should be a tourist attraction. It's just a hanging very small bridge giving a decent view of Rishikesh. That's all about it."
Bridge across Ganga,This bridge is called Ram Jula while the other is called Laxman Jula. We walked across the Ganga on this bridge and while returning used the boat ... just Rs.10 per head
