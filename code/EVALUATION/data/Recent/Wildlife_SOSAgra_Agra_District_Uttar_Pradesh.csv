Wildlife SOS - a highlight for animal lovers,"Visiting the Wildlife SOS bear and elephant sanctuaries in Agra was one of the highlights of my India tour early in 2020. In both instances the private tours were led by knowledgeable and caring staff, the facilities were excellent and the level of commitment and compassion towards the animals was inspiring. Each animal receives personalised care tailored to their specific history and traumas, and it was wonderful to see them living out their lives in such a wonderful environment. It was also so heartening to hear that the SOS program involves the retraining and employment of previous owners and their wives, and education of their children. This ensures that the families have other options and futures that do not include exploiting and abusing elephants and bears. It is not possible to just arrive at the sanctuaries, but entrance can be organised and paid in advance. I would highly recommend both sanctuaries, their professionalism and the security they bring to the animals in their care."
Visiting Wildlife SOS is a MUST!,"Meeting the elephants, hearing their stories of rescue & rehabilitation, & learning the tortuous treatment elephants endure when taken into captivity, was life transforming. We were moved by the commitment of the staff, deeply appreciated Vipul's knowledge & enthusiasm in conducting our private tour, & offered a bow to the elephant graves. Please STOP riding elephants! The world needs to know the work of Wildlife SOS."
Fantastic experience,"I must say that my two weeks trip to stay and work at Wildlife SOS is the best thing I have ever done. I have never before met so much caring, understanding and love towards animals. Everything was so well thought out, cared and planned for , all for the best of the animals. I was picked up at the airport and driven to the volontaryhouse. The room was clean and the house itself was big and wonderful. We got three wonderful meals a day, the staff was fantastic and I can only say I wish for everyone to get the same experience as I´ve got and if you would like to take a volontarytrip, this is the one you should go on. I hope I will go bakc one day!  //Christina  from Sweden"
Super special visit of a wonderful project!,"I applied for a visit in advance and got such a warm welcome with my family. We were guided through the sanctuary, got a lot of information the rescued sloth bears, got a tour in the kitchen, learned a lot about daily life of the bears and got insights in the volunteer program. Wildlife SOS makes a big difference in the lives of these animals and it's very valuable to visit and see it. The past life of these bears is heartbreaking and here they finally can live in peace. The entrance price may be slightly higher than usual but it's all used as a donation and very needed to take care of the bears. Be sure to apply for a visit by email in advance, as they allow only a few visitors at a time to avoid upsetting the bears due to traumas. I personally was very impressed by the work and really support Wildlife SOS in the work they do! Thank you so much for providing us the tour."
Beautiful experience,"Great complex excursion provided by very nice and professional staff. It is obvious these people do their job with so much love and compassion. I visited Elephant sanctuary and it was amazing. They explain you everything, answer your questions and then you see all these elephants so peaceful and satisfied. It's worth it! Support these wonderful creatures and all amazing people who cares about them! Thank you for this beautiful experience! I remember you with love!"
"Excellent overall, wonderful staff!","I was so pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this experience was. The facilities are very clean, the food is home made and excellent, and best of all, the staff is really lovely. I highly recommend this if you want to spend your time working for animals. Disclaimer: you aren’t allowed to touch the animals (not even the elephants) but believe me, when you learn that it stresses them out to be touched by so many people and you see the happy life they have now, you don’t miss it. Wildlife SOS is doing an excellent job."
Wonderful time visiting Wildlife SOS,"Recently visited India for the first time and went to Wildlife SOS. I was humbled and grateful for the work this organization does for the Elephants, Jaguars, Bears, and other animals of India. Beautiful experience and highly recommend visiting."
Elephant heaven,"I am a wildlife professional and I really recommend everyone to visit this place. Elephants are taken care by highest veterinarian and animal - welfare standards. The guide was very professional, informative and kind. This is not a place where you will make selfies with elephants, but a place that will make you understand all the suffering these magnificent animals are going trough when abused for entertainment. From the city you will have to take a taxi to get there (uber and ola are really cheap for European standards) and arrange with a driver t wait for you until you finish your visit."
Amazing experience ! Highly recommended,"It was such an amazing experience to go to Wildlife SOS. My husband and I visited both Elephants and Bears rescue centres! Before the visit I organised the tours by email. Wildlife SOS staff was kind and clarified all questions, even arranging a taxi driver to take us from Agra to the centre.During the tour we could learn more about the projects, and better understand the importance of what they do. All the world should learn about it! I hope you will be able to schedule the visit, you will not regret!"
Visit to WSOS MAthura elephant Sanctuary,"My friend and I visited WSOS at Mathura as I have been a supporter of WSOS...bears and elies for a number of years. I was there when they had rescued their first 2 elies! Our visit confirmed the ethical way WSOS treat their rescued elies...no bullhooks, chains or ropes. Companionship for those who were alone, good facilities and food...plus yummy enrichments for all! We heard about the background of their elie rescues and what they have done to make the lives of these abused and wonderful creatures so much better!"
Bamboo volunteering,I had a completely amazing 4 days volunteering at Agra Wildlife SOS with the elephants and bears! The dedication and knowledge of the people working there is incredible. We learnt so much and where able for a few short days to ‘give something back’. This is truly an experience I will never forget and feel so grateful to have had this opportunity! If you ever do get the chance to visit........just do it!
Amazing,"What a great experience seeing all the good work being done and so close up was brilliant. The elephants were so serene plus some cheeky ones, really great to see after all the pain they've been through.  Wildlife sos are doing an amazing job, thank you for all your hard work and for letting me be a tiny part"
Inspring and uplifting,"Inspiring Place to Visit and so Rewarding. Helped build bear climbing frames, cut food and feed them and paint the places they sleep at night. Loved every minute and was really pleased they were safe and no longercused for dancing. What was also great was some of the old owners who used them to dance were now using there skills and knowledge of the bears to keep them safe and well by working at the centre."
Elephants,"We visited here in March to see the elephants. The man who showed us around told us that there were loads of cancellations due to the Coronavirus and people cancelling holidays - so it was just myself and partner on the tour. It was sad learning about the elephants and what they had endured. When we went to visit the elephants I do feel like we were rushed around. At the time of our tour some of the elephants were out having their daily walk. So we went to join them in the fields. We would stop and look at the elephants from a distance and would observe. Although this was lovely to see we do feel as though we were rushed around. We didn’t get to go up close to the elephants or even get to meet the famous Raju. Reading previous reviews people were able to feed the elephants and give them a wash, we did bring bananas to feed them but this request was dismissed. The tour was meant to be 2 hours long however we were finished within 1hr 30. The man showed us to the shop then disappeared- as we payed for our donation he was walking in with a much larger group - although we were told we were the only and last people of the day. It was nice to see the elephants but I do wish our 2 hour slot was fulfilled and I wish it could have been a bit more intimate. As we left the sanctuary to wait for our taxi we were approached by 5 young boys who we were talking too as they were making conversation. As a member of staff left the sanctuary the boys all ran off. (Which makes me think they have been told of before for harassing customers before). As myself and my partner were walking towards to the taxi the Young’s boys followed and walked very close to us. 4 of the boys stayed by my partner on one side of the taxi and one of them followed me to the side I was trying to enter - very very close. We both got in safely but the boys then started asking for money. The taxi driver locked all the doors and windows. This was something I want others to be aware off."
WONDERFUL ELEPHANT SANCTUARY NEAR AGRA,"We visited the Wildlife SOS Centre near Agra and it was Amazing what they do.for these poor rescued elephants is brilliant  ,they have been stolen at best from their mothers as babies and tortured many seeing  their mothers murdered and then tortured to brake their spirits,but Wildlife SOS  not only care for these beautiful elephants and other animals they try and educate their abusers so that they never abuse  again but seek other ways of life which they fund which stops the rot.If you are near Agra please visit these amazing elephants or if not please donate to their work believe me their work is so important  for these amazing animals who are being tortured and abused on a massive scale."
Great place to visit,"If you love wildlife, and especially bears,then this is for youRescuing dancing bears and stamping out the practice has been so important to save these bears from unbelievable cruelty and exploitation,and near extinction. Our guide was extremely informative and it was a very worthwhile stop en route to Agra. I would highly recommend it"
What a place,I was lucky enough to be a volunteer worker at Wildlife SOS in India.  I helped with the sloth bears and elephants.  Everyone I spoke to was very knowledgeable and were happy to share.  The location is a perfect environment for the bears and elephants to live their best life.  Wildlife SOS do amazing things for so many different animals.
The highlight of our India trip,"After organizing with Wildlife SOS via email, we arranged a car from our hotel in Agra to take my 13 and 11-year-old sons and myself first to the elephant sanctuary for 2 hours and then, after a drink at the on-site cafe, to the sloth bear sanctuary. The day visiting the two sanctuaries was the best part of our trip to India.We had a personal tour guide at each location who gave extremely detailed and inspiring histories of each animal. We were able to get very close observing the animals.  Although the history might be upsetting for young children, we were impressed and inspired.The work that Wildlife SOS is doing is fantastic and we were very happy to make a significant donation to support them. On returning to NYC, my 11yo presented on them to his class and raised additional money."
Most amazing experience in India!,"We had an amazing experience at Wildlife SOS. I had been searching for a humane way to observe the elephant in India. So I was very happy when I came across Wildlife SOS. Shivam is extremely knowledgable in each elephant and the work they do with the animals. He took us through the fields as the elephants went on their evening walks, and he let us observe the elephants eating dinner, telling us about their different preferences. Our experience at Wildlife SOS was refreshing and enlightening. I can't wait to go back as a volunteer!"
A happy life at Wildlife SOS,"I recently visited Wildlife SOS Elephant Sanctuary whilst holidaying in India, what a wonderful place!  Well worth a visit to support the amazing work all at Wildlife SOS are doing, enabling them to rescue and help these beautiful animals live the happy life they deserve."
Visit to the WSOS elephant conservation,"I am a great fan of WSOS elephant conservation centre since Raju was rescuedThis year I finally managed to visit the centre along with my sister who lives in Delhi . It was an amazing experience. We were met by Hari at the centre who really gave us a wonderful insight into the working of the centre. We also got to see the Ellie’s being bathed, frolicking in water, having foot baths and medicated foot treatments. WSOS is doing a Wonderful job fir these Ellie’s. So much love and care  is given. And Ellie’s are finally free from chains. Thanks for the great work you fo. I highly recommend   Tourist to visit and understand about these Ellie’s . Thank you WSOS 🙏"
A peaceful refuge. A learning experience.  A must-see.,"Wildlife SOS runs both elephant and bear sanctuaries -- because the bears get less tourist attention, I decided to write my review on the bear sanctuary :)I actually spent 5 days volunteering with friends between the 2 sanctuaries, which was a wonderful experience.  But a day trip is highly recommended!  The vast grounds are peaceful and lovely, and offer a pleasant walkabout. And best of all you get to see sloth bears up close. There are 171 bears on site, the large majority of whom are former dancing bears.  We had an informative orientation to the sanctuary by Rishik, who clearly cares about the work he is doing. Our day-to-day coordinator, Vipul, was humorous, kind, and patient with us, as we applied ourselves to various tasks (e.g., pouring out bear porridge, painting enclosures, scrubbing out bear pond/bath, building an enrichment object for the bears).  We learned that dancing bears were owned primarily by the Kalandar people.  While the bears provided a much-needed income for the owners and their families, it is important to know that the practice of training bears to dance involves incredible cruelty and torture; the bears ""perform"" because they are subjected to pain.  I should say ""performed"", in the past tense, because reportedly all dancing bears have been surrendered to WSOS.  WSOS has worked with the Kalandar community to ensure they find other work.  Other bears have come to WSOS as trafficked bears (e.g., cubs trafficked for Chinese medicinal purposes). Visitors should note that parts of a short orientation movie may not be appropriate for children due to some brief historical depictions of the cruelty. Our volunteer accommodations, about 10 minutes away by car, were totally sufficient, and overseen by staff member Bhuvan.  The morning and evening meals prepared by Pankaj were absolutely delicious! And lunches onsite at the sanctuary were similarly yummy.  Chai was available on request!  A particular delight was the yoga-by-donation classes offered to volunteers, morning and evening.   As well, ayurvedic treatments were available, for a reasonable fee, from 2 lovely women trained in this art/medicine.I cannot recommend this organization enough. The staff really made it special.  Please consider supporting this important wildlife rescue organization with a visit!"
Happy Elephants and Bears,"When we booked our trip to India we were desperate to see elephants maybe even feed them or bathe them so we looked online and every place we looked at had bad reviews of how badly the elephants were treated so we quickly decided against it. We found wildlife sos and saw how all the animals had been rescued from horrendous abuse and were now rescued by this sanctuary, we had to visit. We were only in Agra for less than 24 hours so we tied it into our trip after seeing the Taj Mahal. Wildlife sos were brilliant with responding to emails and planned our trip out for us and booked us a taxi driver to pick us up from our hotel and take us to the elephant and bear sanctuary and then back to the hotel. The place was just beautiful with fantastic art work done by volunteers we had a nice drink in the cafe overlooking the elephants and the shop was lovely too all with all handmade gifts. We were the only people there so had a private tour with a very informative guide who answered all the questions we had. We got closer to elephants than we had ever been to in our lives and could see up close how happy and relaxed they were. Then we went onto the bear sanctuary where we met another fantastic guide who you could tell really loved the bears. It was so sad hearing about the dancing trade of the bears but nice to see them in a happy environment with staff who know how to keep the bears distracted from the stress of their previous lives with lots of enrichment activities. Would really recommend this place to anyone who loves animals definitely worth a visit if you are in Agra."
Good place,I have visited in this place with my family this is the good location there are the lot of animals available in this place you can enjoy after looking the animals I found this is the best place for spending time with nature with nature.
Chance to learn about animal welfare,"Chance to learn about animal welfare. Really appreciated. We also visited the elephant centre, it was great."
Life saving sanctuary,An amazingly run centre managed with animals and the community in mind. We can all learn from Wildlife SOS
Amazing experience!!,Where do I even begin? The staff were so knowledgeable and kind! What an amazing experience. Definitely a trip of a lifetime.
Wonderful learning experience,"I had some doubts going into the Elephant rehab center as many of these places are not what they're advertised to be.  But boy was I wrong...this place provides a loving, caring home for abused elephants rescued from cruel treatment and torturous lives.  They can live peacefully in this compound, fed and taken care of and able to roam the fields.  The people were wonderfully caring and dedicated to their work.  I am so happy we made time on our drive from Agra to Delhi to visit the Wildlife SOS for Elephants.  The cost is a nominal suggested donation, with no pressure.  I wish we had time to also visit the bear sanctuary...maybe next time!"
Great place,This is a great place that’s looking to help animals that are underserved and overlooked. Visit and support their cause!
"Great place to learn about elephants, respecting them","This is a real sanctuary, where you can clearly see how well they treat the elephants. It is important to increase of our awareness and travel responsible, and this places helps a lot how we can help to stop animal cruelty."
Such kindness,It was a good experience and very educational too. Was great to see that the elephants were so loved and beautifully cared for. Thank you so much
An uplifting experience - don't miss it!,"Visiting the Elephant Conservation & Care Centre in Mathura was a wonderful experience - we are so glad that our tour guide included this in our India itinerary. We visited in January 2020 and were shown around by Harendra Singh (Education & Logistics Officer), whose passion as well as his extraordinary respect for the animals in care was very evident. He described to us the personalities and the likes and dislikes of each elephant. At the time of our visit two elephants, Mia and Rhea, were out on their daily walk with their volunteer keepers. At fairly close range, we were able to watch the pair freely roam and forage in a large paddock.The elephants at the centre have been rescued from situations of abuse or neglect. The facility provides for them a safe peaceful haven, and it was inspiring to witness the caring efforts of the staff and volunteers. There is also a small café and shop selling interesting handicrafts, T-shirts etc.I highly recommend including this visit in your itinerary. It is magnificent to see the work going on and to hear about the successes that Wildlife SOS has had rescuing elephants and also the sloth bears in India."
Excellent day out to both the elephant conservation and sloth bear centres,"I have visited the elephant centre twice before and each time has been different. This time we were not able to feed, bathe or walk with the elephants as we’ve done previously however it was explained to us that the only ones getting in close contact with these beauties are the keepers and this is because they noticed that the elephants became quite stressed around people. Although disappointed we were not able to get up close I totally understand and am grateful they have the elephants best interests at heart over pleasing tourists.I absolutely love the ethos of Wildlife SOS, their holistic, non judgmental approach means that not only are they helping the elephants, bears and other wildlife,  they also help the previous owners who didn’t know anything different and once educated and supported have been able to build a different life for themselves and their families without harming animals.The visit to both centres was excellent, our guides/ education officers were very welcoming and passionate about what they  do and provided us with the best opportunity to see the animals.I could have watched them all day and just can’t understand the ignorance of those that would watch dancing bears or ride elephants.Both centres have shops with some really good quality products and at reasonable prices.Good setup at both centres, clean toilets and an educational room where you watch documentaries about the work wildlife SOS are doing.  I defy anyone to watch those videos and not want to support their cause.I highly recommend visiting both centres, you need to book in advance via email. We hired a taxi for the day, from Agra I wouldn’t recommend getting a tuk tuk as it’s around45-60 minutes away.This made my trip to Agra and can’t wait to visit again!"
Dedicated people for a cause,Staff was so friendly and dedicated...will surely recommend my close family and friends to visit..Thank you
Say no To Rides!,"If you want to see and help elephants, this is the best place to go. It is also really calming compared to the busy cities and, you can feel the passion of the staff and volunteers for their work with the Elephants. I hope the organization keeps doing a great job and helping as many elephants as they can!"
Visit to Sloth bear rescue centre - Agra,"We had a chance to visit the sloth bear rescue center located near Agra. It is the world's largest center. We were hosted by Mr. Rishik Duttagupta (Education Officer & Programme Coordinator) who is an expert and gave us the information about, in what conditions do they get these bears and how do they maintain their hygiene and try to provide them natural wild environment. Not only that they make puzzles for bears which they get engaged in solving and forget about their painful past. They also have rehabilitation centers for Madaris (a community that survives on bear dancing). We were lucky to have our students see and understand this at a young age. This place is highly recommended for school visits."
Great Education,Good Value. Great Education. The staff and volunteers do a wonderful job. The animals are so well cared for.
Outstanding,"I couldn't fault anything. Every effort to keep the visitors safe was implemented. The staff both at the sanctuaries, at the visitors house & our guides were so friendly & helpful beyond their duties. It will be my intention to try to revisit. Thank you so much for my endless memories."
Amazing,Love the work that you do. You really do an amazing job with all the animals in your care. Thank you for rescuing the dancing bears and the elephants and giving them a happy home. I wish you could rescue them all!
Amazing work,"We wrote to the charity a day before via WhatsApp and they responded almost immediately with detailed info advising us of the visiting times. Times are restricted for pre-arranges visits in order to keep it as stress-free for the animals but you can just arrive too for a more limited viewing. When we arrived, he gave us an overview of the work they do and how they helped to eradicate the dancing bear industry in India. Afterwards we watched a short documentary about the charity and then we were able to see the rescued bears. It was really touching to see that those bears were given a second chance in life after what they went through. The bears are too used to humans so they are able to release them into the wild. However, they are well cared for at the charity with lots space and mental stimulation. The charity has their own vets checking them regularly.Thanks to the help of the charity, there are no more dancing bears left in India. However there is still a poaching problem, which they are helping to reduce."
"To see, for sure",You are better see this before all other activities in India. It make your realize a lot on of things. they are hard on
Wildlife SOS is doing the work of angels,"Wildlife SOS is doing an extraordinarily job protecting India’s wildlife. They stopped a 100 year old practice of dancing sloth bears by rescuing the bears and finding alternatives for the people who used them for begging. They now have jobs, education and alternatives for families. The bears live in a sanctuary in Agra because they couldn’t survive in the wild. Wildlife SOS also rescues elderly elephants who were used for begging, rides or temples. The elephants were treated horribly and have now found a safe place and sanctuary with Wildlife SOS. Go visit these sanctuaries and contribute to one of the finest wildlife charities in the world."
Sloth bear rescue,"Recently visited the sloth bear sanctuary. I booked an Agra tour through Tripadvisor with I thought included tickets to the rescue centre, turns out it didn't and we just turned up (very confusing for everyone) We got lucky and they very nicely let us in and gave us a quick little tour.It was a brilliant experience, seeing the beautiful sloth bears with their scars from their lives of dancing and seeing how happy and relaxed they were was just amazing. The guys at Wildlife SOS are doing a great job. It was really interesting to hear about their stories and see some of their cheeky characters. Being a student vet nurse I was very impressed with the level of hygiene and care. We learned about their feedings plans and why they have their particular diet. Definitely worth a visit if you're interested in wildlife rescue. One of my India Highlights."
Sloth Bear Rescue ,Highly recommend you visit if you are in Agra to visit the Taj Mahal.  Unforgettable experience!  I have seen this creatures in the wild.  This is not a tourist trap its a professionally run world class facility.
A place I will never forget,I was able to volunteer here for 3 days. Memories to last a lifetime. Incredible place. I was honored to be able to help these incredible animals.
Excellent Experience ,"Excellent experience, learned a lot about sloth bears and elephants in India. It was really eye opening to learn about the cruelty these animals had endured and we were so happy to see them given a second chance at a peaceful life at Wildlife SOS. The tour guides were incredibly knowledgeable."
Wonerful place,A wonderful place to visit and see the excellent and committed work that both keepers and educational staff are doing to rehabilitate sloth bears and elephants from their brutal pasts. Located in two different facilities the animals are not there (as some people obviously expect) to provide entertainment for visitors but to live the remainder of their years in peace and freedom. We were never pressured for money but would certainly recommend donating as Wildlife SOS receive no government support at all for there continuing good work. Highly recommended
Some nature after Mogul sites,"Very nice place. You can see a broutally wounded bears get their life back. I got a very informative tour with Miss Johi.After the sanctuary you can have a very nice walk on the lake shore and see some birds species. If you are lucky, you will see pelikans and cranes landing on the water."
Animal sanctuaries just outside of Agra- worth visiting if you have time!,"If you're making a trip to Agra and are interested in animal rehabilitation, I would recommend a visit to both Wildlife SOS locations if you have the time: the Elephant and Sloth Bear sanctuaries. They are outside the city and about a 10-minute drive apart from each other- you can hire a cab to get you there from downtown Agra or Wildlife SOS can arrange transport.The price is inexpensive for what you get- a small group, behind-the-scenes, multi-hour tour of the sanctuaries while seeing the animals and learning about the important conservation, advocacy, and education work Wildlife SOS is doing to promote the well-being of elephants and sloth bears in India.Note that the animals don't interact at all with visitors- you simply observe them. This lack of interaction is the true hallmark of an ethical sanctuary- the animals are not there to do any activities for tourists (even ""natural"" activities like swimming or playing), but simply to live their lives free from the horrible conditions of their pasts.My only caveat is that many of the animals have very sad stories and injuries sustained in the squalid conditions they were in before being rescued, so mentally prepare to hear about and see that. And you might be asked to donate further and/or support the gift shop, but I didn't find the staff to be pushy at all. Everyone we encountered was knowledgeable, kind, and displayed a strong commitment to the animals."
Wonderful and educational visit,"Really enjoyed our visit to this wildlife sanctuary and rehab center in late October. We arrived just as the facility was closing, but the staff graciously led us on a short tour anyway. The work that they are doing to rehabilitate sloth bears, protect and conserve habitat, and educate the public about the importance of respecting nature, is truly admirable."
An educative visit.,"We as a family enjoy wildlife. For us this visit was an awesome experience. The keepers and education officers are doing a fantastic job. Each bear has a story and it's worth knowing about each of them. Please do not expect a zoo kind of visit. You need to engage with wilderness and you will see the true sense and efforts of conservation. Mr. Rishik, the education officer made our visit a memorable one. His passion for wildlife is felt with every experience he narrated to us. It's therapeutic for children to understand how animals also need family to feel safe and live in harmony within the ecosystem. Would strongly recommend this place to all who enjoy wildlife. Superb experience. Do book in advance and ask for a guided tour to the place."
Part working plus holiday experience,"Having been to India for some two weeks, four days spent with the elephants and bears .The staff were fantastic so caring and considerate it was breathtaking to see how these wild animals have come forward from their crualty they have been through neverless they are free now to live their lives from been in chains and torture with red hot pokers specially the bears and the elephants been beating to unatraul thing when they should been free, Thanking the wildlife sos India and agra. For a fantastic stay, Christine Baliley, England."
SOS Well Worth the Visit,"My wife and I visited both the bear and elephant sanctuary in November. Rishik gave us a guided tour of the bear sanctuary that included a lunch. Rishik was very informative and passionate about his cause. We had a very interesting couple of hours walking about and seeing many bears in their enclosures. We also got to see many bears up close during their feeding time. What a great job SOS is doing in giving these animals some peace and contentment after years of abuse. We also went to the elephant sanctuary and did a tour there( doing a tour of both takes most of the day). There were several elephants we watched from a distance and then saw them closer when they came in to eat. SOS has good reasons why the tourists should not touch these magnificent creatures. When you hear the stories of how these elephants and bears were treated, it will break your heart. How fortunate SOS rescued them from a life of misery. Although these tours are not cheap, it is for a very good cause. Your money is important as they rely on countless volunteers and donations to keep the project running. You get to spend the day with some incredible animals and will leave with a good feeling knowing that you played a small part in this important cause. A visit to the SOS Bear and Elephant Sanctuaries in Agra is very worthwhile."
Shocking but necessary,"It's hard to see the horrors that these animals had suffered through centuries but at the same time, visiting this place gave me hope and some faith in human being. Thank you!"
Heroes rescuing precious animals,"The guide was so informative and has such a heart for his job of educating the public, raising support and caring for the animals. It was wonderful to see the rescued elephants so well cared for. It was a highlight of my 2 week trip to India, I highly recommend a visit there. If you aren’t able to go at this time consider following them on Facebook and supporting them from a distance."
Life changing experience,An exploration of a completely different world which makes you so aware as a human being about what matters in life.
Most Incredible organization!,I had a life changing experience here and am on my way to hosting my own fundraiser in the US for SOS
Elephant Rescue,A wonderful informative visit to view these magnificent creatures. I loved it. The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly too. Thank you!
Bear and elephant sanctuary,Excellent educational and unique opportunity to understand some of the modern challenges in wildlife conservation. The tour is very detailed you will get up close with sloth bears and elephants. Really enjoyable and an enriching humbling experience
First time visit,Doing a wonderful job!  Staff very friendly and dedicated. The needs and comfort of the elephants are all being met.  I was only there for a few hours and would have loved to see and experience more.  Look forward to spending more time in the future.
Such an important charity,Wildlife SOS has 2 sights very close to each other. One is for Sloth Bears and one is for Elephants. Visit both and learn about the important work they do.
Recognition,Here the workers do amazing work to look after the bears. The place is run very professionally and the standard of care is exceptional. Everything that is needed is on site including medical support.
Wildlife Sos-Agra,"One month ago I visited this centre in wich they take care of the elephants that save and protect from the human cruelty. This is a great place, the staff are really friendly and give us many information about the conditions of the elephants and bears. Amazing experience!Thank you for your dedication and work"
Best volunteer experience ever!,"Amazing organization doing amazing work!  Great people! Magnificent animals! Very educational & informative will definitely be going back asap! Great opportunity to learn, understand & give back! Absolutely outstanding!"
A must visit place,"I went there with my friends and it was an eye-opening experience for us. If you love elephants, this is a must visit place."
Bamboo tour,"Brilliant place. We visited both the bear and elephant sanctuaries. We built platforms for the bears, and painted the elephant enclosure. The people are very friendly and knowledgeable about each I dividual animal. Most definitely recommend a visit."
Magical,"The sloth bear sanctuary was amazing. We were lucky to be able to observe these amazing bears close up, clean their enclosures, feed them and build platforms for them to play on. The bears are well looked after.The elephant sanctuary was equally rewarding and we prepared their food, cleaned and painted their enclosures.  We toured the hospital facility too.At both centres we viewed videos which showed us how badly treated these animals were before being rescued by Wildlife SOS.I am proud to have played a small part in the care of these wonderful creatures and recommend volunteering here."
Sos bear rescue Agra,An amazing experience volunteering with these beautiful bears. They are so well cared for by this remarkable charity.
A marvellous job.,Wildlife sos do an amazing job with all the work they do for the animals that come in on a daily basis. No injured or unwell animal is turned away they all get much needed nutrition and vaccinations and surgery.
"An Informative, Heartbreaking, Moving, and Hopeful Experience","Don't let the unassuming facility deter you. This is a center dedicated to rehabilitating, treating, and healing as much as possible elephants that have been injured while in captivity. I had some sort of thought before this visit that elephants were treated poorly... But learning just how cruel trainers must be in order to ""break"" an elephant to bend to his will make even the toughest people get wet eyes. This is NOT a ""show sanctuary"". No riding, no petting, no photos with a trunk on your shoulder, no touching at all. It is truly a place where elephants are given the respect and medical treatment they deserve after so much intolerable suffering. In the end, you will be both sad for what humans have done but also happy for other humans and their kindness. Ultimately, you will fall in love just seeing the elephants, looking into their eyes, realizing what those eyes have seen, the abuse endured, and still... There is happiness there! Be sure to donate and spread the word to end elephant rides, begging, and performances. The elephants will thank you."
Superb experience,"My experience was nothing less than excellent. A superb time spent with the lovely bears, elephants and the selfless volunteers"
Helping abused animals,Wildlife SOS is a haven for abused/neglected animals in India! I was with a volunteer group and amazed at what they are able to do in helping elephants and sloth bears! Will definitely plan to go back again to spend more time doing what I can do to help. Bless the workers and volunteers for caring so much!
Deserves our support,"These two centres demonstrate that good people have the ability to change centuries of behaviour. It’s not just the rescuing and rehabilitation that’s important, but providing alternative means of livelihood to the former owners of these animals that will result in permanent change."
Trip of a lifetime!!!,"Spectacular!! Life changing!! The bears and elephants are truly loved & taken care of!! Live the keepers, staff...I will be back!!!"
Great Place,This is the place where I was involved during my stint at the Taj View hotel & it is with pleasure that we used to recommend our guests to visit this place.It also was used by the students of the various schools .They would go & enjoy the day visit & learn a few things about the sloth Bear.Do visit this place as the NGO involved has done a great job.
There are no words to describe this amazing experience,"My husband and I were in Agra for a short visit and when we found out about the Wildlife SOS work going on at the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre, we just had to plan in a visit.   This was the absolute highlight of our short trip.  These beautiful creatures have suffered horrendous cruelty at the hands of so-called human beings and it was heart-breaking to see those scenes in the short presentation we had at the start of the tour.  Harry guided us outside to observe the elephants during their afternoon walk; we learned how each had been found and the progress they have made since being rescued.  When they returned to their well-equipped enclosures,  we learned more about each elephant as they were fed.   To see them now, bearing their scars but so well looked after and happy was such an emotional experience I can’t begin to describe.  The 2-hr tour was over too soon and I wish I could have stayed longer.  This organisation depends on donations in order to keep the Care Centre going and I came away wanting to give them all my money (I’m just sorry that it’s not practical).   Thank you so much Harry and the rest of the staff at the Centre for your wonderful work.  We had an absolutely amazing experience – your friends from Scotland."
Distressing,"Reservation are required to visit this place but are easy to arrange on their website. We visited both the elephant and sloth bear Wildlife SOS site on route between Delhi and Agra.  I found this to be a distressing place to visit. The sloth bears are clearly stressed, displaying rocking and head swaying. Whilst the sign on the gate tells you photos aren’t allowed these can be taken at points where the guide allows it, i.e. where the enclosure bars can’t be seen, which feels dishonest to me."
"Incredible work, for an incredible cause","We visited the Wildlife Elephant Sanctuary during an afternoon in Agra. It was such an inspiring experience and money well spent!The NGO wildlife SOS are saving the animals from being tortured and abused for touristic purposes. To sustain their farm, they are creating jobs for local villagers who in return offer land and some food for the animals.A must see!Roland"
Elephant Sanctuary Trip,"Went here Nov 2019 and really enjoyed our visit. Our guide was really friendly and knowledgeable. They do brilliant work rescuing elephants and giving them a nice life. If you're expecting to touch or feed the elephants this isn't the place for you. You get close but interaction is prohibited which makes total sense when they explain why. Small though for Wildlife SOS team.- your monthly donation options are too high. If it was between 7-10 GBP. a month I would definitely sign up. I also know why you have a shop but I think tourists get brought to A LOT of shops and becomes a bit tiresome, but if you had a sign up sheet for monthly donations at a lower price I definitely would have."
Inspiring!,"We visited the  Wildlife SOS sloth bear and elephant sanctuaries in October 2019 as a side trip to visiting the  Taj Mahal, but honestly this was the best part of the  trip! The staff are have so much knowledge and passion. They did an excellent job of walking us through the social and economic reasons  for why the animals needed rescuing, and what they are doing to create sustainable change. If only all social problems were addressed the way Wildlife SOS approaches problems. This is definitely a must-visit if you care about animal welfare."
They see you like a pocket of money.,"Force you to pay and  force you to say it's a donation. It is not if it's mandatory, you decide how much and force me to declare is a donation in order you don't have to pay taxes. They don't want people there, just want their money. Not enough with this they try to force one eleven years old girl to collect money for them!!! Except you are a famouse actor or journalist. Then all will be wonderful for you. But if you are not......."
Educational visit,"My visit was very educational! Wildlife SOS staff was super friendly, food was perfect, accomondation was very good! I really recommed this place for everyone!!"
Sloth bears and elephants,I visited the sloth bear and elephant sanctuary as part of a Bamboo tour . I was fortunate to be able to do a bit of work volunteering  as part of our tour . I was so impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency and scope of both operations ! The dedication and commitment of the staff was incredible . During our stay the team also rescued a 3 foot Krait snake from close to the volunteer house . The work that this team is doing is heartwarming and inspirational .
Second time! Amazing!,"Second time at WSOS and once again, this place will change your life visit after visit!❤️One week volunteering and learning new skills and gaining more information about elephants and bears. Love you guys! Amazing work!If you ever visit Agra, don’t miss this place!!!"
Must visit,"The bear and elephant sanctuaries was the most memorable event in my two week travel through North India. I appreciated and admired the knowledge, devotion, and the sense of inspiration that the stuff at the centers share with the visitors. Both places are must visit. You will meet amazing people and recovering animals that receive a lot of care and love, and you will learn a lot about them and also how to be a more responsible and kind tourist in India."
Visit to the Bear and Elephant Sanctuaries,Found the visit interesting and very thought provoking as to the cruelty of mankind.  The rehabilitation of the animals is heart warming and the obvious care and attention the staff provide is very evident.  The sanctuaries are well kept and maintained and the staff are knowledgeable.  A very worthwhile cause that has obvious benefits and provides some animals with a more comfortable future
Volunteering with rescued elephants & Sloth bears,Can't praise the people who work here enough. Such care and dedication shown to these rescued animals. I will be back!
Thank you,"I am so grateful for wildlife SOS. I learned a lot from them and loved getting the tour. They are helping animals, people and addressing root causes. Go and support!"
Wildlife SOS Elephant Rescue Sanctuary,"This rescue centre was incredible, a must see for any animal lover. The site was beautiful and set well back from the highway, with acres of land all around. We were introduced to the project and then shown a short documentary telling us more about the state of elephant welfare in India and how the rescue centre is helping save abused elephants. It was heartbreaking and eye opening. We got to watch the elephants being fed and were introduced to the 10 beautiful females. The staff were passionate and knowledgeable. Go if you can, it was well worth the trip and the best thing we have done in India!"
I learned so much and gained a new respect for those fighting for animals' rights in India,"My husband and I visited the Wildlife SOS elephant sanctuary and bear sanctuary in Agra. There are a lot of places in India posing as a ""rescue"" or a ""conservation"" when in reality, they are exploiting animals for profit. Wildlife SOS is NOT one of those places. Everything here is done for the benefit of the animals in their care as well as for the benefit of the animals they are fighting to rescue. When we got to the elephant sanctuary, we were given a presentation/slideshow all about the history of elephant exploitation in India and about the current state of affairs. It was absolutely gut-wrenching but it is so important to understand what is going on so we can help in the best ways possible. We were then taken on a tour of the facility and got to see each elephant and learn their story. It was absolutely amazing to be so close to such beautiful, intelligent animals. I can't remember our guide's name, but he was SO articulate and passionate-- he was absolutely fantastic. We then went to the gift shop which is full of crafts and items made by inhabitants of the village that formerly profited from the dancing sloth bears. From here, we went to the bear sanctuary, which is actually located inside of a government run bird sanctuary, so beware there is an additional cost to enter the preserve (I believe it was 500 rupees if you aren't a citizen of India). We watched a video about the history of the dancing bears and once again, it was very sad but incredibly informative. The tour was incredible- we learned so much and even saw a wild antelope! We also got to hear and see the bears slurping their porridge for dinner- it was a highlight for sure. If you are considering visiting, I highly recommend that you make the effort to visit Wildlife SOS. These people care so much about what they are doing, and by visiting, you can help educate others and help support the rescue of all of the animals that still need help."
A Rewarding Volunteer Experience,"I spent 4 days volunteering with these teams of very caring and devoted individuals.  I highly recommend sharing some of your time to give back to the sloth bears and elephants who have been victimized on the streets of India. If you don’t have time to volunteer or even visit, please consider donating for a very worthy cause."
Wildlife SOS Agra,"It was an eye opening experience! It's a must if you are in the area. It's a great project that not only helps the animals but the people as well, since people that has worked with animals are retrained and educated to understand the importance of treating the animals with the love and kindness they deserve!"
Would revisit in a heartbeat,Visiting the Wildlife SOS conservatory was both heart breaking and heart warming. Gaining insight into the cruelty that these living beings experience is eye opening. This organization is doing fantastic work breaking the cycle. It was beautiful to see how they are rehabilitating and nurturing the elephants in their care. I strongly recommend a visit to everyone prior to visiting Jaipur. I hope to visit again in the future.
Amazing!!,"Visiting Wildlife SOS changed my life !! To see how much work and effort is being put to feed and care for and treat the rescued sloth bears and elephants just blew me away, and then to be part of the process was very humbling!! I would love to visit and volunteer again! Shivum , Bheema and Vijay in India we’re absolutely amazing!! Thank you for all the tireless hours you put in for these amazing rescued animals🙏🏼"
What an amazing place!,"I was lucky enough to spend 4 days volunteering at Wildlife SOS, at both their elephant and sloth bear facilities.  Whilst we were there we helped with feeding, general maintenance and building enrichments for the animals.  Everyone we met was fully dedicated to the animals, who were being exceptionally well cared for, many after lives of appalling cruelty. We were educated about the plight of the animals, and about what we can do to help.  If you want a better understanding of the issues facing animals in India, or if you want to help them in any way, I would highly recommend a visit - you won't be disappointed."
Perfect for family!,My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our time and the personal tour we had. We learned a lot and were amazed at the care provided. Definitely recommend!
What an amazing place!,We came to visit the Sloth bear and elephant sanctuaries during a school conservation trip to India. Whilst there we heard the sad and tragic stories of many of the animals but were impressed to see the fantastic work Wifelife SOS have done and do to save the animals from a life of pain and misery. They’ so well cared for and the students were hugely inspired by the company and many are eager to go back and volunteer with them.
Great place,Special place.  So glad this attraction is here to care for the elephants in a humane way.  Thank you for your efforts.
Eye opener ....,"We visited on our way to Agra and had a morning tour booked at the Elephant sanctuary. The tour started with a talk given by one of the team and after listening to the horrifying stories of how elephants are broken to be used for work, we declined the option to see the short film on the topic. This talk will definitely put pay to any idea you have of riding an elephant!We were then taken to the enclosures, where some of the elephants were being bathed  and having their damaged feet treated, giving an opportunity to learn more about the animals as individuals, ask questions and take some photographs.This is the end of the tour itself, after which you are taken to the gift shop, where the profit from anything bought contributes to the sanctuary's running costs and you are also asked to make a minimum donation of 1500 rupee per person. Please give as generously as you can, so that the work done by the sanctuary can continue. If you are going to do anything elephant related on your visit to India, please make it a visit here."
Interesting and touching guided tour,"We had a wonderful experience visiting the bear sanctuary from SOS Wildlife. Call or email ahead to make a booking - we didn't know but luckily our hotel did it for us. We can highly recommend to visit SOS Wildlife to understand more of the important work they do, and to learn about the animals. It was fascinating and very touching to see the bears so close, and that they trust humans again, after all they have been through. It is a highly professional organisation and they really care about their work. We were glad we used this opportunity to break away from sight seeing and to also enjoy the beautiful nature around the lake. Do visit and donate generously, every help is needed."
Volunteering ,"We volunteered for a week with this wonderful organisation, a highlight of our 3 weeks in India! We paid a donation for the 5 days, all accommodation and food included. First day was orientation at both locations, then 2 full days at both the sloth bear and elephant sanctuaries.I love how these animals are cared for. There is no touching of the animals, they had a very tough life before being rescued, and the centres are all about what the animals need. Just being close and helping with feeding, cleaning and building was perfect.Wildlife s.o.s also helped with transport to and from Delhi.Thanks to all the amazing staff, it was a great way to experience India!"
Educational tour that fund the protection and care of elephants and sloth bears!,"We arranged our elephant tour directly with SOS to visit while we were in Agra. We came in October and we were given a choice between 2 time slots, we chose the 10am-12pm 2 hour short tour. Give yourself plenty of time to get from Agra to the sanctuary. Traffic can get pretty hairy outside of Agra. We were in a small group of four people. When we arrived and we were shown a pretty sad video of the way the elephants end up imprisoned. Then you sign some forms and your on your way into the sanctuary. The tour was really interesting and educational. This group is doing amazing things for elephants and they have actually eliminated the practice of dancing bears in India!  While we were there the elephants were getting fed and the crew was bathing the elephants. They looked so happy!  We got some great pics and videos!Bottom line is that you should NEVER see an elephant show and NEVER ride an elephant. The statuary needs funding to feed, care and free these elephants from their sad imprisonment. Help them out by visiting!"
Think twice about riding an elephant!,Really interesting visit - wonderful what has been achieved with the dancing bears..  And realised how misguided I was about the use of elephants and how they are trained.  Everyone needs to hear it...
Amazing,"My family and I had an amazing time learning about the great things SOS is doing. We had a good idea of the treatment of the animals prior to our trip, but had no idea it was so bad. we all loved helping with the sanctuaries. thank you so much for the education and work experience. the home stay was very welcoming also. thank you all for the cherished memories. we hope to return some day to help some more."
Trip to Bear Sanctuary,Had a pleasant morning visiting the SOS wildlife sanctuary. We were the only 2 people there and had a tour by a worker who was a friend of our guide coincidentally. Feel that they could attract a lot more paying visitors with some professional marketing help.
I gave them a $1000 donation,"That's how impressed I was. And my kids had a great time. Hard to beat. They are walking the walk of environmental protection. Very heartening, even as you cringe to see what humans have done."
Worthwhile visit,"The elephant sanctuary was a worthwhile visit to go to on our way back to Delhi having visited the Taj Mahal in Agra for an overnight stay. We were the only ones for the tour so it was very personalised and we could ask as many questions as we liked. I learnt so much about the elephants and their sad life beginnings. It broke my heart to hear all the horrible stories of mistreat but made me realise what great valuable work the wildlife sos charity have done and continue to do, solely based on money from visitors and donations. It was amazing to get up close and personal with the elephants, seeing them have their daily washes and what food they ate. Really enjoyed it and would go back again in the future so I can donate more money!"
Bamboo India Holiday,A very worthwhile visit and volunteering experience to Sloth bears and elephants. Keep up the good work.
Fantastic place.. a serene beauty away from city,"Though,  we didn't want to disturb the natural beauty, yet observing it from a very close proximity was a fantastic experience. Bears need a special mention here. Thanks to sos for their noble effort"
Legit elephant sanctuary,"If you thought India's elephants have been waiting desperately for you to lift your western ass into touristy locations and touch, bathe, paint, or ride on them there - well - you're wrong. Learn about this and more in this legitimate sanctuary for (formerly) mistreated elephants. You can't touch or feed them, and the males you cannot visit at all, but at least you know that you are in one of the few places where ""the 'phants come first'"". The SOS Wildlife sanctuary is the second-best place for the elephants to be after their natural habitat, and going there is the second-best option for you after staying home and leaving a donation."
#refusetoride,"Please, please, please visit this amazing sanctuary. The elephants are so beautiful. The staff are so caring and knowledgeable. Simply one of the greatest afternoons I have ever had. They really need all the support we can give them. Kids to grandparents this is amazing!!!"
Wonderful!,"As heartbreaking as it is knowing what these poor animals have gone through before coming to Wildlife SOS, it is the most comforting thing in the world knowing they get to have their happily ever after in the care of these wonderful people.Thank you Wildlife SOS!"
Please visit & spread the word,"My husband & I had an informative 2 hour tour with our guide, Harendra. His passion for rescuing elephants & dancing bears was very much evident.This was an emotional tour for me as I love elephants & to hear the horrific lives they've had to endure was heart breaking.  However hearing & seeing all the hard work the sanctuary does to rescue and rehabilitate the elephants was a truly positive experience.I feel it is my duty as a responsible tourist to spread the word about what happens to these majestic creatures and I'm fully supporting the sanctuaries refuse to ride campaign.I look forward to the future when I can return as a volunteer.Thank you again for a memorable tour & for all the amazing work you're doing."
Wildlife SOS,"We are a family of five (three of which are teenagers). We went to Wildlife SOS's elephant and sloth bear sanctuaries. They were so amazing. We loved spending time seeing how Wildlife SOS takes such excellent care of these animals that they have helped rescue. There are some amazing people working selflessly to take care of animals that before they were rescued, had very rough lives. We were able to be at the elephant sanctuary as they took them out for their walks. It was so fun to stand in the field and see elephants walking around, rubbing against trees and trumpeting. Our three teenagers loved both sanctuaries as well. This was their favorite activity that we did in India. Both of the sanctuaries are not too far away from Agra. We had a car and driver, and you pretty much need a car and driver to visit them as they are outside of the city in rural areas."
Awesome experience,"It was really a rejuvenating experience, compassionate and friendly bonding with bear and elephants there. However few suggestions I would like to make-1) Advertisements can be done in the form of posters and visual display near Tajmahal and bharatpur bird sanctuary 2) An online link can be generated on google search for Tajmahal and Bharatpur bird sanctuary.3) People who can't donate in form of cash, should be allowed to donate in form of their labour to serve animals or participate in agricultural activities"
Fabulous organisaton that is making a difference in the world,"My driver had a hard time finding this centre (mainly because he refused to look at google maps - because it is wrong....) and I did not arrive until 11am.  Thankfully, I was the only person for this time slot.  The tour around part of the site (as they rightly point out they are not a zoo and the animals are not on display) was great, with informative signs and views of the enclosures and treatment areas.  I saw four bears (two of which are blind) and was allowed to take a few photos.  How fabulous the work they have done to stop bear dancing, with great initiatives to retrain the bear handlers.  Let's hope they can stop the poaching.  I used the souvenir shop to buy some much needed gifts, since the money goes to the cause."
Very uplifting experience ,"I spent 4 days volunteering at Wildlife SOS, helping with the daily care of the lovely rescued elephants & sloth bears. I'd definitely recommend it to anybody thinking of going!"
Support these guys,We went to see the bear sanctuary when we were staying in Agra.  In fact did a detour on our way to Jaipur.  The educator showed us around and explained everything to us in good English.  We saw maybe ten bears.  Paid at end by credit card and bought some great t shirts from their little shop.  These guys have made such a difference to the lives of the once dancing bears and they need support to keep going
Eye opening,"Only went to the elephant sanctuary, our guide explained to us all the horror and hardships that these beautiful creatures have had to, and still do, endure. If you're going, be sure to bring a warm heart and prepare to see/ have explained to you the graphic details of the elephants' suffering all across India. Inspiring place, and many, many thanks to our guide!"
Discover a hidden gem,"No one in our extended family had heard of this place inspite of visiting Agra many times. So when a friend mentioned this place I was very keen to visit it.30 mins before agra on the old delhi-agra highway stands a billboard which if you blink you shall miss.Once we got there we were introduced to our guide who was very patient with us and our toddlers before we set out to have a look at the elephants. We must have seen atleast 12 of them. All elephants share a painful story of cruelty and mishandling before being rescued by Wildlife SOS, who then make sure that for the rest of the elephants' lives, they are well fed and made to feel safe with no more work done by them till their death.There are 2 main areas where the elephants are kept and we were shown only 1 area as the elephants in the other area were still not used to seeing humans at close quarters and were being managed more closely.We had a quick trip before the heavens opened up and we spent the rest of the time chatting and drinking good tea.My 5 yr old was fascinated to see the mighty beasts and we had a great 2-3  hrs at the place.The entire organisation runs off donations and the tickets are slightly pricey (a bit more than a movie ticket + popcorn) but understandably so.When asked why isn't this location more widely publicised, the simple answer was that they didn't want to turn this into another zoo!They run it to give peace to the animals.The best we can hope is that these magnificent animals forgive us as a race. We have to try to undo what we have done to them."
A+ experience,"My husband and I had an outstanding time at the elephant refuge center. Our guide was very knowledgeable, about elephants in general and the fate of elephants in India. I was most impressed by his high familiarity with all of the elephants at the refuge--he was happy to share his own intimate knowledge of the the elephants--which ones were mischievous (his favorite) and which ones were lazy, and which were good friends. This window into the lives of the elephants allowed me to see them in a new and more personalized way. I highly recommend a visit to the elephant conservation center to anyone!"
Wildlife SOS - Elephant Conservation and Care Center,"Such an amazing place for the rescued elephants. Vipul told us about the elephants, the work they do at Wildlife SOS and told us about the horrors these beautiful creatures had to endure. It was so amazing to see these animals safe and in a happy place. Thank you Vipul and everyone at SOS Wildlife for the amazing work and showing us around!!"
Peaceful places-compassionate work,"Two adults and one teen enjoyed both elephant rescue and sloth bear park. Sloth bear park also had deer, many birds, large turtles and monkeys. Guide at elephant sanctuary did a tremendous job. Glad we started there. 2 hours in each place, perhaps a bit more to enjoy a cafe overlooking elephants."
Visit to the Wildlife SOS Bear Rescue Centre,"Last week we went to visit the Wildlife SOS Bear Rescue Center a little outside Agra. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating as we did not know exactly how long it would take us to reach their place. It is a little difficult to find, as it is part of a Bird Sanctuary and in order to reach there, you have to enter the sanctuary and pay entrance fees there also.The place is very beautiful with lots of tree and wildlife/birds walking around. A member of the staff welcomed us and gave us a private tour of the centre, giving us a lot of information about the work they do rescuing dancing bears and injured bears from the wild. It is the largest bear rescue centre in India and they have around 170 bears there. Besides taking care of the bears they also support families of the gypsy community of Colanders who used to catch and train bears for dancing so that they can earn their money with legal professions. We saw the bears, were told about their daily schedules, their feed and what is done to keep them comfortable. We were allowed to observe the medical treatment of a minor wound and were shown the impressive veterinarian hospital they have. In the end they show you a movie about the rescue of dancing bears and then you can visit their little well-kept shop.They really do a great job rescuing dancing bears and taking care of wild animals which get injured, so we felt great to visit this place and support their work. They took good care of us and answered all our questions. Really recommended to do when you are tired of seeing all the temples, palaces and forts of India and well-worth supporting!If you have some more time, I also recommend taking a walk through the bird sanctuary which has a large lake and you can observe birds and monkeys there."
wildlife sos is a great ngo,the ngo literally doing a great job to save animals... I was amazed ith the help these people are going to our mother earth
Wildlife SOS,"Had a great experience at Wildlife SOS, the staff there are fantastic and take excellent care of these Elephants. Our guide, Harri, was incredibly knowledgeable and took time to explain the back ground of each of the elephants and the work Wildlife SOS has done to rescue them. They have a huge field for the Elephants to walk in twice a day and looking to expand so they can rescue more. The centre offers a small restaurant for snacks, cold drinks. There is a souvenir shop but there was no pressure to buy anything (a t-shirt cost 5 GBP). DO NOT take heed of the negative comments, the people moaning that you couldn't ride or touch the elephants have totally missed the point of the place. Perhaps you should go to the circus and watch them be abused for your entertainment instead? As for the donation, this goes towards the running of the place and is a pittance to most western travellers. I'm aghast that people would complain about this.All in all. I would recommend this trip to anyone and help make a difference to the lives of these elephants."
Fascinating (Elephant sanctuary),"I’m so glad we stumbled upon this place just before our visit to Agra. I absolutely adore elephants and was thrilled to be seeing them in a nice environment.As much as it is heart breaking to hear their background stories, it surely is very enlightening, and makes you think twice before opting for entertainment involving animals, such as riding, going to the circus etc.What’s more important now is that the elephants they have, are in perfectly good hands. They get walked out onto the open field A LOT and they genuinely seem like very happy creatures in this environment.Unfortunately, I never noted our lovely guides name, but he was very passionate about his job and knows almost everything there is to know about elephants. Good job!!"
great,"enlightening interesting and fun,. the guides are really engaging and have answers to any questions. great cafe and gift shop too"
The field of dreams,"What you need the most it's comfortable shoes and open heart. Contact them and ask what you should bring with yourself!Take your time and enjoy this beautiful experience, i suggest at least two week!"
elephant sanctuary visit,the work this place does is amazing wirh the elephants and the community. their stories broke ya heart of howcome they ended up at the sanctuary.. a big thankyou for the amazing work you guys do
Enriching experience,"Coming to Wildlife SOS and volunteering has been such an enriching experience. The staff are so knowledgeable about India's wildlife and willing to answer any questions about the animals. The animals here are getting a life they truly deserve, after so many years of abuse and exploitation. I now have an even greater appreciation for wildlife and wish to get more involved in conservation in the future."
A Must Do Experience in Agra!,An eye-opening experience at Agra Bear Rescue Facility the world’s largest! Our educational tour was both uplifting and upsetting. Special mention to our dedicated guide Rishik Dutta Gupta who's passion for this project is palpable and inspiring. A must do experience while in Agra!
Humans that care!,My time at Wildlife SOS was short but truly amazing!  It is wonderful to still see people that care about our wildlife and will do whatever they can to make this world a better place for all living creatures!  We had a fabulous time visiting the Bear and Elephant sanctuaries and working to help in any way we can.  I wish we could have worked closer with the Elephants but do understand their reasoning around it.  All the staff are amazing and the facilities really do make a difference.  It was heart wrenching to see the bears and elephants that were previously abused and struggling to adjust to their new environment but Wildlife SOS does everything possible to give them a better life.  Thank YOU from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to be part of this amazing experience!
Worthwhile visit to see the elephants in Agra,"The staff at SOS Wildlife centre are a dedicated bunch.  We learned a lot about the treatment of 'dancing' bears and elephants used for commercial purposes and then we got to see the elephants and watch them as they were taken on their walks.  If you want to visit a place that is trying to defend and protect these animals, you should give these guys a visit.  It is about a 50 minute drive outside of Agra."
"Incredible, outstanding, amazing","Went to the elephant sanctuary in August with World Challenge - most amazing organisation. So sad stories about the elephants and sloth bear but I have full faith in how much the keepers care. One of my favourite parts of the trip (and it was an outstanding trip so that's saying something). Would highly recommend to anyone interested in animals and their welfare. We went for the 2-hour visit and with the very hot and humid Agra weather, that was long enough. Would recommend phoning ahead if you' re going with young children and some of the descriptions of the torture the animals faced are horrific and graphic. Overall an outstanding place and an amazing visit. (Btw my World Challenge had 6 adult and 29 teens and everyone thought it was incredible.)"
Most amazing experience,"So honoured to see what they’re doing for the elephants, most surreal experience! Would do it again in a heartbeat. Would love to help more!"
Highly recommend  - a true sanctuary,"I've worked in the animal rescue field both as an employee and volunteer for decades. Often, when you see the word ""sanctuary"" you question whether they are truly doing the work of saving animals or just taking them in and using them as another form of profit. I am so pleased to say that the team at Wildlife SOS exceeded my expectations as a group of people truly looking out for the best interest of the animals and giving them the dignity they deserve to live out the rest of their lives without fear of abuse or neglect. I highly recommend a visit to Elephant SOS or any of their affiliate sanctuaries on your next trip to India. It's a very easy visit to wrap into a day at Taj Mahal, as well. On the way to or from Delhi makes it a natural stopping point. I love seeing just how much acreage these elephants have to truly roam freely and feel like free elephants...as much as they can. There is no petting or riding the elephants (this is a good thing - these the abuses they came from). Instead, from a relatively near distance, you can observe their beauty in nature. This is a team worth supporting financially for the work they are doing in India to save the animals."
Great place for people who cares about animal well-being,"I have been to both the bear and elephant sanctuaries in Agra. Both places are relatively close and can be easily visited in the same day. They are located in a very peaceful and beautiful place. During your visit, you will learn more about the history of each residents of the sanctuary. But you will also discover by yourself how captivity have impacted these animals, both physically and psychologically... It’s a wonderfull association that is also involved in education and empowering women. People who work here are passionate person who will share their knowledge and love about animals with you.I recommend this unique activity which I think is unavoidable. Probably one of the things I preferred during my trip. I hope to be back soon as a volunteer."
Elephant Education,The organization is very transparent in expressing what they are doing with donated funds. The educational information that is provided is excellent. They truly care about the welfare of the animals and are doing great things - the positive outcomes are visible. Our Girl Guide group learned a lot and felt that it was very worthwhile visiting the sanctuary. Definitely one of our highlights of our trip.
The Elephants,It was a real experience to meet the elephants that had been through so much heart breaking torture I truely believe that the wildlife sos is a one of a kind experience you couldn't get back in Australia im really happy I chose to go.
Animal Lovers Heaven,"I have been following Wildlife SOS on Facebook for a few years. I am familiar with the elephants that they have rescued as well as the other animals they rescue and release daily. When I had the opportunity to visit India and volunteer with this group, I was beyond excited.  I spent 4 days volunteering with their bear rescue and elephant conservation centers.  I am so impressed with the organization, love, and respect these people have for India's wildlife.  All questions were answered, we were educated on so many issues involving the safety of the wild animals, but best of all we were able to directly work on tasks that were HELPING these animals who will spend the rest of their lives in a safe haven with people who will look after them and help heal their physical and emotional wounds.  I highly recommend visiting and/or volunteering with Wildlife SOS.  The people are so friendly and  truly have the animals' best interest at heart. I will keep in touch and continue to donate toward their mission to save India's wildlife by education of the public as well as treatment and rescue of the animals."
World Challenge Visit,"During our visit to India as a part of World Challenge we decided to go to Wildlife SOS and we did not regret our decision as we all thought this experience to learn about the elephants that they rescued and what situations they were in before and what they are in now. It was amazing to see what the staff here are doing for these abused elephants and how they have helped them to get back on their feet to a better life. The staff here treated the animals very well and were very knowledgeable about them and what they have been through and were able to provide us with an insight about animal abuse in India and what we can do personally to stop it or help to stop it. We as a group really enjoyed this experience and would highly recommend it to groups, friends and families."
Love the bears,"I am a Vet Tech and my husband is a Vet surgeon.  We were both very impressed with the facility and the people who care for the bears.Animal abuse is world wide. Go see the bears, talk to their humans and give them lots of money!  You can't save them all, but you can help save these."
Shift of consciousness.,The experience you have here can only be described as life changing. The work and education here is second to none. If only every country had such understanding it would be a better world. Extraordinary people. Extraordinary place.
Spotted a roadside advertisement!,The security guard let us in although we had no appointment After a short wait I was shown a video on the horrifying life some elephants face! The Education Officer then showed me all the females Currently there are a total of 22 The rescue of each elephant is a long procedure needing much financial & legal support🐘
The Experience,Helping out at the bear and elephant sanctuary was a very good experience and it felt so good to be able to help out the animals who had been suffering a lot prior to their rescue. I highly recommend volunteering at this sanctuary.
Volunteering with Bears and Elephants,I absolutely loved working with both of these Beautiful Animals.Staff were very helpful and informative about what we done and why. I also came away with a better understanding of what the Animals have been through in there life 😪😪.l would absolutely recommend anyone thinking about doing it..JUST DO IT.🐻🐘
A must visit,"A true pilgrimage, way above any temple visit. Soul enriching, much more than any mountain or beach."
Great Experience,We had a great experience with Wildlife SOS. My favorite part was the tour and getting to meet all of the rescued Elephants.
See and Save Elephants!,"A wonderful way to experience elephants up close without contributing to the problem. The elephants, bears and all wildlife need our help! Visit SOS!"
Great experience!,"Great presentation at the beginning to build some context, passionate staff, and well taken care of animals! India needs more places like this."
Amazing experience,A very good initiative for elephants ..just hope they continue rescuing more and more elephants .. and please pay your visit and donate a generous amount
SupportWildlife SOS ,"When we arrived here, we didn’t knowWhat to expect..First there was briefing by the staff.then we walked to several elephants , and their history.A lot of these Elephants had a trauma, so Encounter them from a distance..They really seeme to do a good jobBut iT is still sad to see the Elephants ..For their OWN sake They have to be keptI would encourage a lot of people to visit &support this organisation for their good work .."
Noble cause!,"I only had time to visit the Elephant Conservation & Care Center. I attended the session from 3-5pm and more than half of the time was spent listening to the talk. Although the talk was educational, I was really looking forward to spending more time with the elephants so, to be honest, I was rather disappointed when we wound up spending only about 15-20 mins with the elephants and that too only from a distance. Although I don't know of any incidences with the centre's rescued elephants, it seems the centre no longer allows close interaction with the elephants such as feeding, bathing and walking as a preventive measure owing to the unpredictable nature of elephants. Wildlife SOS is definitely a noble cause but I think the centre needs to develop a more meaningful visit programme, including a more professional educational talk. I'm not looking at painting or riding the elephants, but even just having more time to observe the elephants would have made the visit more meaningful. I also feel donations should be determined by visitors instead of a minimum fixed rate."
Best experience of my life!,"This organisation is doing amazing work in the saving of animals from being used as props for human entertainment. these animals life as free as they can, ensuring they have a happy and stress free life whilst still having their care ensured by their mahouts and the staff at Wildlife SOS.Even in the extreme heat of summer they were able to find jobs for us to complete and ensure our health was still a priority. I will be back again, however, it will be winter!"
"Fascinating, but very grim","Learning about the elephants was fantastic, but due to their traumatic lives you can’t touch them or get too close when visiting. It’s a very humbling experience, but this is not the type of place that you paint the elephants and take fun photos."
Elephants and sloth bears!,"I came with a group called Bamboo. We cleaned cages and elephants. We made a hammock for the sloth bears.  I was there for four days. Hard work but very satisfying.  I suggest the facility buy a shovel to clean up after the elephants! Other than that, extremely inspiring and enjoyable .  Thank you!"
GREAT EXPERIENCE,My visit to the sloth bear park was a spur of the moment decision when I found myself with a free afternoon while on a month tour of India.  My tour of the grounds housing the rescued bears was one on one and my guide was also my teacher and I learned so much about the plight of these bears.  It opened my heart to the wonderful staff that dedicate themselves to running the park.  Bless them all.  This is something I will continue to support.
Visit in the winter,The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable. The weather in June was just too hot to be able to volunteer to my best abilities. The bears and elephants were treated very well.
Amazing work being done.,"This is a must visit place in agra. I think its abt time we move over from the monuments to living breathing beings who have been granted a second life. I came to know about this place from my brother and visited along with my sister. I jst dnt hv words for the trauma these animals had to undergo at hand of us humans. But the wrk these guys are doing at the shelter is just amazing. The elephants are handled with so much love and care, every elephant has its own handler, their own enclosure and a definite routine. This place has medical help also at site and provides accomodation to volunteers as well. Its a vry different experience just being there soaking it all in and realizing while we get on with our lives there are actually people who are dedicating their time to reinstate humanity. They charge a small fee but it goes a long way in helping with the day to day expenses. I didnt get a chance to voulnteer but would love to sometime in future. Till then hats off u guys and keep up the amazing work."
Our visit in June 2019,"We visited the SOS sanctuary twice during our stay in Agra and was guided by Mr Bheema Ameehb who was a passionate and knowledgeable advocate of the work done to provide quality of life for rescued Sloth Bears and other wildlife at the facility. The practice of keeping captive bears as roadside entertainment and a means of generating income was outlawed and the sanctuary provided a home for these animals as it was impossible to rehabilitate them back to a wild existence. Best practice animal welfare, enrichment and housing provided a welcome refuge and future for these formerly abused bears. Please support the work of Wildlife SOS India,"
Incredible work!,"What an amazing project to visit. One of the best animal sanctuaries i have visited so far. You get a detailed explanation of the work they do there, and you get to meet the elephants in person. Amazing experience!"
most meaningful experience traveling in India,"I highly recommend visiting and especially volunteering with the Wildlife SOS center, which is very accessible from Delhi, Agra and Mathura.  If you contact the volunteer coordinators (their contact info is listed on the website), they will arrange for your transportation from the nearest train or bus station.  Volunteering there costs some money, but they do justifiably need quite a bit of funding in order to maintain their highly respected and efficient operation, and volunteering includes accommodations and food.  This was the most powerful part of my month-long voyage traveling through India.  I learned so much about the history and current state of abuse of these magnificent, beautiful, worthy-of-life animals, and I learned even more about the most effective ways to change the system and the culture to respect these animals and care for them in the long term. There are several elephant rescue centers in the world, but only a small handful of such centers are well-respected due to their ethical practices. Some other ""rescue centers"" still allow volunteers to ride the animals or interact with them in ways that are unhealthy. This particular one is also effective because it not only rescues and cares for the animals, it also works at the governmental, political, and educational level to increase awareness across India to change the culture around this.  AND the organization provides employment opportunities and job training to the very individuals who were formerly earning their income by exploiting the animals. So, they intervene at all levels possible.  It is heartbreaking, beautiful, very important work. I highly recommend getting involved. I will carry this memory with me forever."
A true elephant sanctuary!,"It is an incredible organization that does great work rescuing elephants (among other animals)  You are not allowed to ride them - unlike some other ""rescue"" centres out there. - its never ok to ride an elephant, no matter what they tell you.   This is a true sanctuary where the health and well being of the elephants is the priority.  The guide was very informative, helpful and next time I definitely will be volunteering for a week!!  It really breaks your heart listening to the years of abuse these elephants have suffered, how they are taken as young calfs,  tortured to break them physically and spiritually.  SOS tirelessly continues to campaign and raise awareness to stop the practice of using elephants for riding/begging.  Well worth your visit!  Definitely one of the highlight while visiting India."
The Rescue Centers!,"The work done by Wildlife SOS for the Bears, Elephants as well as the other animal, birds and reptile species is commendable. One can say; Wildlife SOS plays a key role in the welfare of troubled animals in India. Being at the rescue centre which is a rehabilitation facility was truly mesmerizing."
Magical Elephant Sanctuary,"If you're looking for an ethical way to see some elephants up close and support an incredible organization, Wildlife SOS is the perfect spot. It's a bit off the beaten path, but oh so worth it. Loved the back story they provide about each of the elephants--where and why and how they were rescued. The elephants are glorious and you are not supporting a violent, brutalizing industry. Amazing gift shop."
Saved Bears were less than claimed,The Wildlife SOS said they have around 500 saved bears but I visited their twice and only see 4-5 bears roaming around. So if they have 500 bears then where they are..?Location is good which is next to NH8 but bear population is less as per claim.
Beautiful happy bears,"Wonderful facility and great work work helping the bears have a good life, thanks for all your work II was a wonderful experience"
Wildlife SOS - an experience of a lifetime!,"The time spent working with both the amazing elephants & endearing sloth bears was overwhelmingly brilliant. To give back in a very physical way, in order to make the lives of these animals rich beyond compare & allow them to live out the rest of their days in as natural & carefree a setting as possible, makes my heart sing & puts a huge smile on my face! The staff are truly inspirational & care for the animals in such a personal way - helping them with their daily chores was a real privilege .... ❤️ to each & every one of them!"
Most Impressed,"This is exactly what we were looking for.    My husband and I joined up with four independent lady travelers,   We were given an educational and interesting talk and short video by Vijay Varma the Education Officer and Volunteer Coordinator.   We then had a leisurely stroll round the elephant compound being introduced to each of the 22 elephants - their history and their outcome.     Vijay more than willing to answer our questions and discuss the way forward for Elephants in India.   We had a snack lunch which was more than sufficient as well as visiting the small but well stocked shop.    Toilet facilites also acceptablre - clean and tidy.My husband and I then went on to the nearby Moon Bear sanctuary and again taken round by an enthusiastic Education Officer and Volunteer Coordinator.   I am more than harpy to replicate our views here.This is a charity which indeed really must have more support for the worthwhile work they are undertaking by giving Tourists as well of the local population a taste of how Elephants and Bears were treated, and how they are now educating the masses on the welfare of these most wonderful animals.A wonderful day well spent.James and Jane Buchanan"
Amazing experience.,Highlight of my trip as staff were super friendly and was great to see how the animals were saved after their terrible start to life. The boards were very cute where it showed us there likes and dislikes. How they give the former poaches jobs in being responsible animal carers is the best thing. The shirts and jewlery in the shop is fairly priced and great quality. 100% recomend to everyone i know.
Great!,Great job of all the group that help these poor animals bad treated giving a new life out of sufferings!
A truely wonderful place to visit,"I have been to both the Bear Sanctuary and the elephant rehab  several times. Love seeing what is being done, keeping in touch with what is happening and talking with the volunteers and workers."
Sanctuary for the elephants!,A wonderful centre of excellent care and retirement for elephants who have suffered a lifetime of abuse. The elephants are cared for with such passion and love. The staff there are amazing people.
well organized place ;-),I enjoyed my visit to the elefant care center as well as to the bear care center. Thank you for being my host in your guest house. Hedi
My Bucket List,"My friend had invited me for a talk. Mr Kartic- the co founder of Wildlife SOS was visiting Mumbai and it was one of the most moving talks I’ve ever heard. He started talking about the Dancing Bears of India and took us through the entire journey from how baby bears are snatched away from their mothers in the jungle, the mother is killed in front of them, a hot iron rod is pierced through their nose and then a thick rope is passed through. Every time the rope is pulled up the bear gets so much pain that he jumps up AND people like us think he is dancing. For generations bears have entertained people on Indian steeets and we have been oblivious of the pain and suffering. Kartick and his team approached this tribal community 7-8 years ago, offered them an alternative means of livelihood and convinced them to discontinue this brutal tradition that their ancestors had taught them. They gave them a hand rickshaw in exchange of a bear and made sure their children get an education so this practice never continues. Since then Wildlife SOS has rescued 800 of these bears who are in their sanctuaries all over India. Ever since the talk Ive always wanted to visit the Rescue Centre and it became a part of my bucket list. My children had spring break in March 2019 and I had to convince them for this trip to Agra over maybe a holiday in Singapore or Dubai. I put them on a guilt trip to do this for me as I believe it’s very important for children to be compassionate and that won’t happen till you don’t expose them, show them and then let them experience for themselves. As we reached the sanctuary  My children were engrossed from the beginning as our guide Rishi started the story and took us around the Centre. He made the entire tour so interesting and humourous that we didn’t realise we had finished three hours. He knew every bear by name and spoke so passionately about their routine food etc. My children took back a lot with them specially when met the LAST dancing bear who was rescued from Nepal-Reshma. She was in quarantine and was enjoying her delicious watermelons and treats. It was a happy ending and a thought that ‘nothing is impossible’ if you onlyTRY. Our next visit was the Wilslife SOS Elepahnt Sanctuary which was close by.  I won’t tell you their stories. I will leave it for you to go and discover. There is so much to learn and so much joy to spread. As a parent I wanted my family to have a holiday that will be etched in their hearts forever."
Wildlife SOS,I was a volunteer at sos and enjoyed every moment It was heartbreaking knowing what the animals had been through but they are now well cared for and FREE 😊
Amazing experience!,I loved every moment of getting to see the elephants free and happy after everything they went through. This organization is amazing!
SOS wildlife sanctuary,Everything was great....did NOT know what  a TRUE sanctuary was like until I visited this place.....they have the only elephant hospital in India!!!!! great learning experience of how elephants in India are treated in ashram and temples...HORRIBLY!!!!! if you love animals you'll definitely be touched by the compassion shown at this place......very friendly staff...especially Shivam.
Fabulous work,Wildlife SOS care for neglected and abused elephants and sloth bears. near Agra. Amazing work is undertaken. Volunteers can help at the centre. It is wonderful to see the work that Wildlife SOS are doing.
Wonderful and important organization,"My family of four with two teenagers visited Wildlife SOS for a tour this past January.  Sadly, we didn't have more time to do some real volunteer work, but we really appreciated and valued our tour of the facilities to understand more what they're doing for elephants and bears.  They are doing amazing caring work.  It's so wonderful to see and hear about how this organization stopped dancing bears in India.  Hopefully they can stop all working elephants as well.  We learned so much about the horrible treatment of the elephants but were full of hope and joy watching the workers take care of the elephants.  Each enclosure has a history of each elephant, which helped us get to know each elephant's personality and background.  Very moving!  They are doing such wonderful and important work.  Please visit and give them money so they can keep doing what they're doing!"
I ❤️ elephants,A great afternoon spent learning about elephant conservation. The elephants are just gorgeous.Recommended
CONSERVATION SOCIETY,Wildlife SOS build in Agra is conserving and serving for those animals which are harmed by their owner previously or they have been got harm due to accident from the truck. So the work of Wildlife SoS is of saluting. Best wishes for the future. And i will try to join with Wildlife SOS
Wonderful experience,"Wildlife SOS are doing an amazing job in providing a sanctuary for previously abused and neglected sloth bears and elephants, they are also providing a community to assist in doing so"
Educational and Moving,"After a short introduction and video we walked among the elephants and keepers during their afternoon turnout time.This is not a hands on experience, but we had plenty of time to watch very close to the rescued elephants and talk with the guide.Excellent photography opportunities.Definitely recommend!"
Eye opening experience,A unique activity to do in Agra - Very educational and eye opening. Had a great time as our guide showed us around and answered ALL our questions. Will be back to volunteer next time!
Volunteering at Wildlife SOS,"Fantastic! What a wonderful was for animals to live. The staff was great, very helpful and informative!"
Elephant heaven,A fantastic sanctuary with a really ethical approach to animals and people; a highlight of our trip.
Elephant Sanctury,Fantastic place to visit or stay and volunteer. The care and knowledge with the elephants was outstanding and the care with visitors was exemplary.
 keep up the good work ,"Kudos for the gr8 work guys, a must visit place. Was truly an amazing experience. The staff is well educated, special mention of Mr Shiva was a gr8 guide."
Wildlife SOS,"Beautiful place. Very inspiring. It's comforting to see that people are helping the species on this planet. Not only are they changing the world into a better place, the Wildlife SOS also creates awareness and leads by example."
It was amazing,This trip was so goodIt touched my heartAnd wanna visit it soon as possibleYou people are doing a great jobElephants are love💚
"Amazing! Beautiful people, fantastic facility!","Please go and visit this facility. The wonderful staff put so much of their time and effort into caring for these animals. Hearing the terrible stories of the lives these animals once lived then being able to see the happy, natural life they are now living since being rescued from WSOS gave me feelings that are hard to describe, I am so proud of these people, so so happy for these animals, I am filled with admiration and happiness, and most of all, I have shared their  stories so passionately as they have all touched my heart, I believe education is the key and I feel like I am now one of those key holders and will continue to inspire others to be apart of this fantastic organisation, all it takes is a visit..."
Wonderful,"A memorable experience, very well informed staff, heart warming programme. Particularly impressed by the thought given to retraining the poorer folk who were going to loose as a result of the removal of their bears."
Best way to visit Elephants without chains and Pain,"It’s a place where elephants are helped after being used in other parks as tourists attraction.It’s a lovely place and it is soo nice to see them finally in peace.Spread the word, everybody needs to know what’s wrong about all the elephant riding attractions and let these lovely giants Rest In Peace respected by their owners"
Our experience at wildlife sos,What an amazing organisation! we came in not sure what to think about this organisation. We are so happy we gave this a go because it was so rewarding. All the funds go towards helping the animals (they really need it). It was incredible and informative and the workers have a real passion for the animals. I would definitely do it again!
Meeting elephants respectfully,"It has been my dream for a long time to meet elephants and, i must confess, to ride them until i learned how much they suffered for this. So when planning my trip to India i was looking for a place where i could admire them as the magnificent creatures they are and even better if by this i could support a place where they take care of them and put there safety and wellbeing first. Wildlife SOS really is an inspiring place and a great experience to have. Fully recommended."
Beautiful Creatures & Beautiful Mission,"My visit was educational and inspiring. It is so amazing to see how dedicated everyone at this organization is. Visiting the site, you can see how happy the elephants are. They don't sugar coat the truth of what has happened to these elephants, and what is still happening but they do offer solutions."
Hidden gem near Agra,"My friend and I visited this facility when we visited Agra and this is so worth the drive (about an hour from Agra). After seeing all the street performer elephants forced to work under excruciating conditions, it was so refreshing to go and see happy elephants grazing in the field and bathing themselves. The worker mentioned there is some threat that developers want to take over the land so it is SO IMPORTANT to support this organization. I believe to visit the elephants it's 1500 rupees (merely $20) so if you can donate anything more it is so appreciated. We got one of the best iced coffees I've had in my life from their cafe and sat on the back deck where you can watch the elephants playing from comfortable lawn chairs in the shade, highly recommend!"
Wonderful and Humbling Experience,"I would highly recommend this trip. We went to the elephant sanctuary first. We heard the story of  the elephants and I do not think anyone could comprehend the cruelty they have endured over the years.To seem them being so well looked after by the people who worked there was indeed very humbling.We stayed for lunch and then went to the sloth bear sanctuary.Again all the bears here have had very sad and tragic live until they were rescued. The impact of what happened to them is so very visible today. The people who started the sanctuary have done so much work that there are no longer any dancing bears in India.So if you are in near Agra please try and visit, I believe you will not regret it and the sanctuaries do rely on public donations to keep them going."
Wonderful visit!,"We visited both locations on the same day.  They are about 10 minutes apart on the same road.  The staff are knowledgeable about each animal and want very much for visitors to be happy and comfortable!  Upon our morning arrival, we ate breakfast at the elephant rescue sight.  The sloth bear rescue was particularly interesting as we knew little about them.  My daughter is a wildlife college graduate and loved her time at both places.  Be aware, some of these animals have been abused.  They have both physical and emotional damage and will never fully heal...sometimes hard to observe."
Elephant Excellence,Such a moving visit.  The elephants are amazing and their stories incredible !  To learn how they were tortured to be trained and what is being done to stop the torture.
Inspirational,"I spent substantial time at both the bear and elephant centres,  it’s amazing what WSOS continue to achieve in the face of the many and significant challenges."
The best day of my holiday!,"We visited the Elephant Care and Conservation Centre, as elephants are very dear to my heart.  The day began with a short introductory talk and video of elephants in the centre, and later we had an opportunity to meet the elephants and to help feed them and wash them.  Sadly, we couldn't see any of the males because they were in musth, so were kept a little away from us, but we got to meet the ladies, who were wonderful characters! Later on we were given lunch - delicious.  I loved every minute of our time there and was sad to leave those wonderful elephants.  The staff were great too, dedicated, clearly attached to the elephants and always happy to answer questions. This visit was the highlight of our visit to India and I highly recommend a visit."
Amazing day at Wildlife SOS,"We had an enriching and informative experience at Wildlife SOS. It's so important to learn about the abuse of elephants so that these barbaric practices can be stopped. The way the elephants are cared for is fantastic and the animals, rather than the visitors, are put first. Many elephants are scared of humans due to abuse and therefore you cannot touch them but learning about them and meeting them through the gate and on the walk is incredible. Our guide Vijay was very helpful and answered all of our questions. We would love too visit again."
Amazing experience in this fantastic sanctuary!!! A must see....,"My sister and I recently had the opportunity to visit the Wildlife SOS sanctuary for Bears and Elephants during our trip to India. Whilst we went with high hopes to see the amazing work the team do, our expectations were exceeded in every sense of the word. From the moment we arrived and throughout our entire day trip ( we arrived at 9am and left at 5.30pm) we were walked through the entire establishment and explained the incredible work the team do there. We had the great fortune to see these beautiful animals up close, who had endured much hardship prior to coming to the sanctuary, to now be at peace and thriving in these beautiful surrounds of their natural habitat. It was also so great to hear the additional work the team does with the local schools and tribal families that would have previously been involved in the bear and elephant trades, and how they are providing additional resources to educate their children and provide work for the women ( some of their beautiful crafts are also on sale in the local shop)A must visit in my book... We will definitely return some day. Thank you so much to Rishik and the team for our unforgettable day with them and these beautiful creatures.."
Fantastic Day,"Visited the bear and elephant rescue facilities in late March, and what a great visit to see the excellent work being done at both centres with very knowledgable staff, you get very close to the animals which is great, but also sad to see how they were treated before they were rescued, that is why this work is really important and your visit directly helps keep these beautiful animals safe and well cared for, so take some time, arrange to have lunch at the elephant centre, and go support this fantastic place."
A persoal tour and appreciation of the excellent work of this sanctuary,It was very hot when we visited but the staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Heart rending stories of the bear rescues and as we had young children with us we avoided the video.Keep to the 2000 rupees per person reccomended donation but spend liberally in the small shop !!they are doing some remarkable work under difficult conditions and deserve our support
You must visit this facility! See the rescued bears and elephants,"I stayed with Wildlife SOS for 4 nights and had a roller coaster time.  Sad because of how the animals ended up in their care but so, so happy to be able to work with the charity and make a difference.It is a real education working here and understanding the trauma the animals have experienced.  It is uplifting to see how the charity has worked with the Kalandar people to educate and retrain them to help them build a more sustainable life without the bears.  The elephants and bears cannot be released into the wild but this facility offers them a fantastic life as close to the wild as they can be.Well worth a visit even for just a day"
Amazing Elephants!,"A wonderful experience seeing rescued elephants.  Starts with a film which is distressing and then a short tour with a very knowledgeable staff member.  The care for the elephants is clear, their wellbeing is at the heart of this sanctuary.   There's a great gift shop full of elephant and wildlife inspired items and I was happy to support this amazing place."
Superb voluntary efforts and service,"This is a place where elephants are kept and looked after. They are rescued from the treachery and volunteers give them lots of time and care. This experience must not be missed. If you can donate or give your services for this Noble cause,it will be great contribution.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram"
Great Bear Care (and elephants),"I visited both the bear and elephant refuge that are part of Wildlife SOS as part of a volunteer element to my Bamboo tour. The education officers were amazing - so knowledgeable.  We learned about the efforts taken to eradicate the practice of dancing bears, and the work underway to ensure elephants are not abused.  The facilities are very clean, and the animals are really well looked after.  Highly recommended - see if you can arrange to volunteer too!"
ELEPHANTS!,"My husband and I spent the whole day on March 27, 2019 at the Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in Mathura which is an easy drive from Agra. The website mentions time slots for shorter visits but by contacting the organization directly by email in advance of our trip to India we were able to secure a full day at the Centre. There are advantages and disadvantages to the full day visit. The huge advantage is to see absolutely every aspect of the daily life of the elephants: cleaning, feeding, exercising, etc. The only disadvantage is that the elephants are most active in the morning and then again in the late afternoon so there are a couple of hours in the middle of the day when there is not much to do. We did not mind this, as we were provided with a tasty vegetarian lunch and enjoyed just sitting, watching and photographing the elephants from the veranda, but this down time might try the patience of children in particular. One thing to note is that each little group of elephants (2 or 3 to a group) has its group of caregivers (2 or 3 people) who do all the interaction with the elephants. So, do not expect to feed or wash the elephants yourself. It was explained to us that interacting with strangers causes the elephants stress and that is the last thing we would ever want to do so we were happy just watching. We did have some hands on activity chopping fruits and vegetables for the elephants to eat. This organization does wonderful work for elephants and other animals in India and deserves all the support it can get. There is no fee to enter but a donation is requested and we were happy to pay. We learned a lot and had a wonderful day. The gift shop is great as well.RIDE BICYCLES NOT ELEPHANTS!!!"
Elephants in heaven,"I was truly inspired by my recent visit to the elephant sanctuary in Mathura, India!  The work these people do to rescue abused eles is phenomenal and brave.  It takes a huge undertaking and a massive vehicle (the elephant ambulance),not to mention money,  to save just one life. Volunteers are much needed here and all donations welcome. Great to see that human contact with the elephants other than with their keepers, is not encouraged,to try and bring these creatures back to a normal state. Very impressed!"
Majestic- Tales of Love & Rescue,"I recently visited the elephant rescue with my sister. The email conversations prior to the visit were very professional and all the detailed information that we might need was shared with us. We reached early yet we were greeted well and made comfortable before our tour. Vijay gave us a tour and told us all about the rescue. We got to see the elephants while they were on their evening walks. It was such a great feeling to see them graze while we heard their personal stories. By the end of it, we felt like we knew each one of them personally. I could see each animal shares a special bond with their handlers. One of the amazing bit was that this organization not only rehabilitated the animals but also the community hence uprooting the problem. Its always a challenge to rescue and j and these guys are doing a great job. Each animal is special and they deserve all the love in the world. Im going to sign up for volunteering next time."
Wild life ,Many animals are found here. The place is very nice and clean place. Love the place very much. Very good place
Must visit,"This place is wonderful. Easy to arrange a 2 hour tour around. Our guide was so passionate about the bears and the work of the charity as well. Heartbreaking to see what these incredible animals just been through and how this continues to affect them, but through the hard work of the staff at the centre they can finally have the best care possible."
Life Changing Attitude toward Elephant Labor,"Much ink is here on the value and purpose of this fantastic SOS for elephants and other animals in India.The outpouring of care toward the animals is palpable. Our guide quit a day job at CitiBank to do this full time--you know it is a mission with purpose.The thought that goes into each rescue is truly amazing. Rescue is holistic. Wherever they find an elephant being abused, they ask questions about the place where the elephant is currently being put to work.  How much revenue will be lost? What benefit did the elephant bring? What other issues is the village having? To rescue an elephant, not only was money offered, but perhaps also a well dug for the village. They leave the community better than they found it.The care for the individual needs of each elephant is fascinating. While one may need to go on a diet, other may be malnourished and need to be fed.Stop on your way to the Taj Mahal; take a day trip from Delhi! Get involved. You can come stay and volunteer.This is change in action."
Highly recommend stopping by!,"This is a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours and break up the car journey from Delhi to Agra or vice versa. Book your slot in advance via the website, we were late as we got stuck in Delhi traffic... the charity does amazing work not only in rescuing traumatised and injured bears from their lives as so-called dancing bears but also supports the communities that maintained these traditions by encouraging them into different work or even working for the charity itself. They rescue elephants and snakes too! You pay an entrance fee and a suggested donation, or can also buy a specific gift such as sponsoring a bear or paying for food for a month or medical care... keep up the good work! Caroline and David, France"
Informative day out. Can highly recommend,We visited both the SOS bears and Elephant centre (10 minutes drive apart). The work that they do is incredible and we now donate on a monthly basis. Each tour was very informative. My daughter is considering going back to volunteer for a few weeks. I'm hoping that more tourists become aware of these fantastic sancturies. Keep up the exceptional work guys!
Heartbreaking but also heartwarming,"One of the symbols of India is the elephant and Ganesh is the Hindu elephant headed god, so it is perhaps surprising that not all of them are well treated by their owners. Indeed many of them are subjected to great cruelty in training for one of three tasks; logging, riding and begging. The cruelty doesn't necessarily end with the training and some is quite subtle e.g. a begging elephant may be used to collect alms in return for a blessing; the sanctuary has an elephant used in this way and pilgrims fed her veggie burgers. Needless to say it was not a good diet and she was grossly overweight, having difficulty in standing.  There are if I remember correctly some 1200 elephants working in India; you have to have a license to own one but only about half the number are licenced. It doesn't take much imagination to work out how an elephant is likely to be treated if the owner can't be bothered to be correctly certified. The centre is doing what it can to treat the creatures it can rescue but unlike the UK where the RSPCA would prosecute owners of cruelty, there is no organisation in India capable of doing any such thing. So owners of the rescued elephants have to be paid to release them to the centre and this is an expensive job for the charity.  They desperately need the funds to rescue more elephants, so if you want to see elephants up close and personal on your trip to India, pay a visit to the Centre and make a donation. We shall be visiting Jaipur on part of our trip and I had some reservations about an elephant ride up to the Amber Fort but having visited the Centre and seen the elephants there, I shall most certainly not be riding up to the fort. The awful treatment of these lovely creatures will only stop if there is no money to be earned from them because tourists refuse to ride them. The future of logging and begging elephants is in the hands of the endemic population but tourists can help the riding elephants. If you are in the Delhi/Agra area do visit the centres; they also have one for rescued 'dancing' bears."
Amazing and worthwhile visit!,"Our visit to the Elephant Conservation and Care Center was fantastic. Our guide, Shivam, shared the horrendous history of the maltreatment of these animals, and it was so moving and heartbreaking to hear about how these majestic animals are slowly being saved and taken care of through the incredible work of the individuals at Wildlife SOS. We only came for a short visit this time, but our entire group plans to return to volunteer in the near future."
Amazing place,"We really enjoyed finding out about Wildlife SOS's work through our visits to the Elephant Centre and Bear Rescue Facility. The staff who took us on the guided tours were friendly and very knowledgeable. It is clear that the animals are very well cared for and, whilst their past stories are sad, it's great to see that they are now living somewhere that meets their needs. If you would like to have a more up close experience with wildlife in India and want to avoid supporting activities that exploit animals then I would 100% recommend a visit to Wildlife SOS."
Magestic creatures being well cared for,"I found out about the Agra Bear Rescue Facility and Elephant Conservation and Care Centre by chance, but so glad I did. It was a great experience and was wonderful to see the terrific work this organization is doing in India. Not only do you see the animals being well cared for you receive an education in the process. So rather than being a tourist riding elephants up to Amber Fort, I was please we were tourist providing a tiny  bit of support for these majestic animals in an environment that is supportive and where they are not put to work.."
An educational and worthwhile visit,"We spent the afternoon at both the sloth bear and elephant sanctuary.  Our guides, Rishik and Vijay were both dedicated, informed and helpful guides.  I really wanted our kids be exposed to animal life in India but wanted to avoid supporting any exploitation of the animals.  What better way than to do so while supporting an organization who has had such a tremendous track record at ending this exploitation.  I highly recommend a visit to these sanctuaries."
Heart-wrenching and heart-warming,"My family and I (kids aged 6 and 3) spent an amazing half day with Wildlife SOS outside Agra.Easy and quick to organise, Rishik answered our queries clearly via email and we were booked in for Bears and Elephant guided tours at short notice.Rishik took us around the Bear rescue centre and Vijay gave us the tour of the elephants.Both had good English and provided some real insider knowledge about the animals in their care and the efforts to run the projects.We enjoyed both centres immensely, sincerely distressed by what these poor animals have gone through at the hands of humans, but at the same time amazed and grateful for the generous work these guys and the centres do to provide safety and comfort for the rescued animals.The sight of a majestic, huge beast such as an elephant, being mistreated is emotive and upsetting, and has long captured the hearts of the public, but we all agreed after our visit that we were equally, if not more so moved by our visit to the sloth bears.  Rishik gave us so much information, painted such a well-rounded picture for us about the history of bear dancing, the culture and traditions of Kalander people, the efforts to reform and support the community.  He was engaging, passionate, mature and honest.  We really enjoyed all aspects of the tour especially seeing the bears and their special porridge being made in huge pots on open flames burning on mustard seed patties which reduces pressure on forests.  So much thought to the overall impact of the organization - really impressive."
Lovely...,"If you are animals lover, than this place is better than others. We saw many rescued bears, elephants and other animals. Lovely  to see."
Eye Opening and Great Organization,We had a little way to drive out to the Elephant Sanctuary and as pulled into the location you could see multiple elephants roaming the property on their walks. We were greeted by the friendly staff and watched a short film on the hardships these poor animals had to endure. It was really eye opening to see the cruelty that some people are capable of. Wildlife SOS is doing what they can to help give the elephants as close to a normal life as they can. It is obvious they are cared for and the elephants seemed happy. We got to go for a walk with the elephants and as they were brought back to their stable we even had the opportunity to feed one of them. Can’t speak for the bear sanctuary as we only had time to visit the elephant but what hey have done for both animals is great and I believe it’s worth your time to visit and a donation to help them out. 10/10
Great place run by well organized & caring people,"Please visit the bear care center and support the great work of this place ;-) I had a guided tour to the place, everything was well explained. I was also able to stay in the guest house."
Wildlife SOS does important work,This place is much better than the Taj any day. It's tranquil and rewarding to see the bears in a much better place.
A beautiful and heartbreaking trip,"SOS wildlife are doing amazing work at rescuing, looking after and protecting the elephants in their care. It was wonderful to meet the elephants and learn more about their stories. My only criticism would be that it wasn’t clear what you would be doing in what time slot. The slot we had didn’t involve feeding or walking with the elephants. This wasn’t a problem however if I had known in advance I would have tried to book a different a slot. I would highly recommend visiting the Centre and donating money towards an incredibly worthy cause!"
Highlight of my trip,"Without a doubt, visiting the elephants at Wildlife SOS was the highlight of my recent trip to India. The centre is located in the middle of nowhere (about 1-1.5 hours from Agra) off the road down a dirt track. When you arrive it is safely fenced off to keep people out and the elephants in. It is 10000% worth the effort to get there.The centre is clean with good facilities. You can email to book a space for a tour and experience walking with, feeding and reading about the elephants all of which costs only about 1500 rupees (£16) per person. An unbelievable price for an incredible couple of hours. The team are wonderful and first tell you about Wildlife SOS and their mission before taking you out in small groups to see the elephants. It was so emotional and I am so glad that people like the Wildlife SOS team exist. The work they are doing is incredible, giving these incredible animals a safe and happy place to live after decades of torture and abuse. They didn't make me feel pressured to donate more than their suggested entry fee but they do have a great little shop we stocked up on some merch to take back to the UK!Walking with the elephants was magical and feeding Chanchal was a huge item ticked off my bucket list. Please please visit here if you ever find yourself in or near to Agra, a life-changing and memorable experience."
Great work done here,We visited the Elephant Rescue Centre - which is about 10km from the bear rescue centre. A not-for-profit organization rescuing and rehabilitating elephants - very impressive work and we were lucky to see elephants returning from their afternoon walk and help with feeding - a different but very worthwhile activity
Indian Bear,very poor arrangements could not see any sloth bears there.might as well be closed . no public amenities arranged there too
Humbled by generosity,"Thank you to sos wildlife - our visit over the past two days has been very rewarding,  very entertaining and very humbling.  A must do for all visitors."
Saving elephants,Well worth the visit.  They are doing a great job helping the majestic elephants.  Worth the visit to support such a good cause.  Keep it up!!!
Elephant Sanctuary -- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,"*What I wish I knew before going:*1. It's a two-hour educational opportunity about the plight of elephants in India, and a guided tour of the facilities. Sign up in advance!2. There is an option to extend your visit by volunteering, doing things like cutting vegetables for the 'phants. Sign up in advance!*What a lot of people don't understand:*1. The elephant rescue and bear rescue are two separate locations!2. You will not pet them, feed them, paint them, ride them, bathe them, or walk with them. You will stand a respectful distance away and watch them, and listen to their stories. So. We had a great visit here. Very informative. Glad we went. This is a legit, and very serious, not-for-profit elephant rescue operation. These elephants have been abused, now healing and creating family groups where they can live out the rest of their days. After visiting, you will no longer want to ride elephants, or see tricks. (Likewise, you might no longer want to be part of the human race. Can't help you there, bud.) Hari was our guide, and very good. The film is shocking and upsetting. Gift shop has lovely stuff, and proceeds help maintain the elephants. Small cafe; drink your Masala chai, listen to the elephants trumpet, and watch Peanut play with a log. Very pretty and peaceful location. Makes a good stop from Agra enroute to Delhi."
Volunteering at the elephant and bear center,"Our family just spent 6 days at the center assisting either at the elephant or the bear facility. It has been an amazing experience for us all.The team there was very welcoming; their passion and dedication is impressive. We learned a lot about the animals. It has been very touching to hear their rescue stories. It is an important cause. If you have the time and want to do some volunteer work, I can highly recommend it. Otherwise, go visit for a day."
Sloth bear rescue centre,"More than 100 sloth bears rescued from tribals and nomads are stationed here , treated by vetenery doctors as they were brutally kept by their ownersThe place has an attraction of bears playing out in the open swinging climbing trees or just lying down in the sunSome are very old and blind but they too have recuperated due to doctors of Wildlife SOSAdjoining area of keitham lake and bird sanctuary are an added adventureTime to visit :- October to february"
Excellent facility,"We got to see several bears, including a few that were at least partially blind, and a few that were recently rescued and still a little fragile. One of the methods bears have for reducing stress is to swing their heads from one side to the other.  When this is done standing up, it is assumed to be a sign of a flashback to having been groomed for dancing (none of those observed today were seen doing so while standing).  Our tour also included an observation from the top of a set of the bear pens, access to which was a bit of an adventure up and down a ladder of dubious handrail safety.  We also toured a very nice medical facility here.  Thankfully, a doctor is always here if needed.Original content removed by TA censors. You may message for original commentary on why the bears need care."
Great institution and touching experience,Those guys had done and are doing a wonderful work to save bears and elephants which were in very bad conditions. Now the animals are loved from people and they can have a good quality of life even than they don't be free. The keepers do a great job with them and finally those animals don't be afraid of humans being who have been  so cruel with them. I really raccomanded this place. Please visit their centres (bears and elephants rescues) or becaome a volunteer for few days or more or make a donation to their association.
Women V Cancer Group trip to Wildlife SOS prior to a charity cycle ride in India,"We wanted to experience India first hand prior to starting a charity bike ride to raise funds for women cancers.  A group of 25 of us hired a coach and headed out to Wildlife SOS for a personalised and unique session with both the sloth bears and elephants.  It was both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  Hearing and watching videos on how the project evolved and seeing the poorly treated elephants and bears brought us all to tears.  But to see them in their new environment, with love, care and rehabilitation was incredible.  We are able to get close to the elephants while they were roaming free and to see the bears in their own environment.  You only had to look at the condition of them to see how well they were treated and their movements of happiness.  Rishik and his team were extremely knowledgeable and it was a pleasure to visit and to support this incredible project.  Highly recommended if you are in Agra and we will definitely return when next in India.  Well done to Rishik and all the team for their dedication and hard work in achieving such a brilliant outcome."
Interesting & worthwhile,We spent a few quiet hours touring this facility.  Kudos to Wildlife SOS and the work they do to rehabilitate these bears.
Definitely the most touching experience in India,"It is just incredible what this guys are doing to save and take care of this animals. We went in both, elephants and bears centers. They clearly explain to you, step by step, the origin of the association, why they are saving the animals and how it happens but the most beautiful part of the tour is meeting personally the animals. With the explanation of the guide and the shown pictures you can clearly see the difference between their time of torture and slavery and their new life in the centers: now they are healthy, happy, playful and curious animals. Thank you for saving their life, we definitely need more of those passionate people in the world."
🐻 Park,Best place to be in. These people are doing very good work of saving the 🐻 of India . Nice place to visit.
Heaven for rescued wildlife,Its easily approchable via NH 19 (previously NH2). While coming from New delhi elephant rescue centre will come first. Make sure to pre book your visit online. Charges are 1500 rs per person. You can participate in all voluntary activies like preparing food and washing elephants. Then 10 km there is keetham lake bird sanctuary and bear rescue facilty. Make sure to take ticket for visiting bear recue facility at the main enterancr. With 50rs ticket you get a glimpse of bears and if you willing to do more then one can make donations and see the entire facility how the bears are fed and washed and you can also see  documentary on the last dance! The documentry was heart wrenching Couldnt believe the cruelity imposed by humans on these lovely creatures.
Amazing place,"Please, don't ride the elephants. Better go to visit them at Wildlife SOS center, where are elephants rescued from circuses and from owners who treated them badly. We had amazing time in Wildlife SOS learning more about their work and elephants, we fed the elephants and got to know their stories."
Best experience ever!,"Thank you guys!❤️I loved my stay at Wildlife Sos.I am recommending this experience for everyone who would like to volunteer with elephants and bears. Animal lovers, this is your call!!!!But be careful, your life will never be the same anymore☺️❤️🐘I’m missing this place and animals every day now. But the best thing is, you can always go back and help more!Please people support them and donate, if you can’t travel there yourself❤️Can’t say more than just AMAZING people are taking care of these rescued animals. Go go go!!🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🐘"
Godsend ngo,Wildlife sos center is near to agra at churmura Farah. It's a elephant rescue centre. This ngo has saved elephants from various parts of country to provide shelter here. There is also bear rescue centre but I don't know whether it's under sos control or not. I HV attended sos seminars. Do visit not just for your sake but for elephant sake and give some donation. Main person baiju Raj is born for such altruism
touring the sanctuary,"We went on a tour to this bears and elephants sanctuary for a day, the spaces for the animals are well conditioned, and the animals have their caretakers and volunteers taking care of them. The guides are very friendly and well prepared and ready to answer any question, the very educational tour and the best thing is to see the progress of these animals. It is really worth going there and if you have the possibility of volunteering there even better."
A peaceful place for bears and elephants,"I had a very nice tour in the elephants and bears facilities; I learnt so much of the life and behavior of these beautiful animals. The labor that this organization makes, rescuing these precious creatures is amazing and very meaningful for those who have endured a lot of suffering. I really hope come back some day to do volunteer job."
a pleasant and moving experience,"I had gone to the mathura facility with my family and it was a moving and immersive exprience at the facility. the passion and commitment shown by the staff (namely Vijay) as well as others in taking care of these elephants that have gone through a lot in life, was quite special. the tour was educative and there was a lot of informed interaction with the elephants. you also get to see a fair amount of squirrels and peacocks. the cafe was quite nice and the stuff that they dish out is good quality. elephants, like us do need someone to take care of them in their old age and otherwise and wildlife SOS is doing a stellar job in a sustainable mannerOverall, a fairly satisfying and educative experience which was very different in its nature. I would recommend visiting the facility."
An enlightening visit,"This facility is dedicated to saving and rehabilitating sloth bears who had been used as ""dancing bears""in street shows. It was interesting to see the lengths this organization goes to to achieve the objective. It was also sad to see that, despite the dedicated efforts of the staff, some bears were so traumatized that they still went through their ""dancing motions"". Spotted deer and monkeys also enjoy the facility."
The Only Way to see Elephants in India!,"I had been very sceptical about going to visit Elephant sanctuaries due to seeing how poorly they were being treated at Amber Fort, Jaipur. However, I can honestly say that what this foundation is doing is truly inspiring and noble. There are twenty elephants in this facility, all with very tough and sad backgrounds, but they’ve almost had a second chance thanks to the tremendous work by the charity. We walked around the facility and were able to see these majestic and beautiful creatures from a comfortable distance for the elephants Please support this charity over any organisation in Jaipur as they are actually supporting the elephants and their welfare."
Heart warming,"We visited the bear rescue today and it was very heart warming to see the sloth bears get a second chance at life. It was very sad to hear what the cruel humans did with these beautiful bears for entertainment. While visiting, we found out that you can volunteer at the rescue. Something I’ll be considering in the future."
"Awe-inspiring, humbling, heartening. A genuine sanctuary","I've just spent two weeks volunteering at Wildlife SOS's elephant and bear sanctuaries and can't recommend it enough. WSOS work tirelessly to rescue & rehabilitate elephants and bears used and abused for tourism and religion in India. The keepers seem to genuinely care for the animals and although they will never be able to be released back into the wild, this is the next best place for them after being in captivity for so many years. The animals spend their days eating, sleeping, bathing and playing and it is heart-warming to see them being allowed to just be themselves. WSOS also supports the previous owners of dancing bears and elephants and their families by hiring them at the sanctuary, educating them and offering healthcare. The women are supported to make items that are sold in the sanctuary's shops and the children encouraged to attend school. It is an incredible organisation not only for animals but also for the people of India, its economy and future.Please do not support the abuse of animals by taking elephant rides or giving money for elephant owners, regardless of whether it's at a temple or being used for religious reasons. Check out Refuse To Ride for more information and do your research before going to any sanctuary or zoo anywhere in the world."
Please visit this beautiful place,"When travelling to Agra , please don’t just visit the Taj Mahal but take a trip to Wildlife SOS . We visited both the elephant conservation centre and the bear rescue sanctuary.What an amazing experience to be able to see these beautiful creatures & know that they’re now safe from harm & being looked after by such wonderful people . Please give them your support x"
Support If You Can or Visit !!,"Had a beautiful afternoon with the elephants and team at wildlife s.o.s These elephants have been rescued from the tourism trade which use barbaric training methods to get the nicely behaved for rides and jobs etc.They so far have 20 and they are all well looked after here with open land and are fed,watered,treated and walked throughout the day.Unfortunately some of these guys have received permanent damage from abuse such as blindness or damaged legs so please remember that you may find the experience informative but very sad.You can even apply to volunteer and stay onsite.Thanks team, you are doing a wonderful job."
"Life changing ... an amazing charity doing, sad to say, essential work","My friend and I have just spent a week volunteering here, focusing mainly on the elephants. I would recommend anyone and everyone to spend time here, but be prepared to be emotionally and physically challenged at all levels.It never ceases to shock me that man continues to abuse/ harm animals for their own entertainment, yet they continue to trust us to care for them.The staff are fantastic, tireless, informed and committed to all the animals in their care. Facilities for volunteers are way above what we expected, clean comfortable accommodation and great food. We will be back, just sad that we had to leave ... so spread the word, go volunteer and help save our planet."
My happy place!,"I've been to the wildlife SOS for almost 9 times in 2018, I go there to volunteer every month. The work they are doing as an organisation is so great! All the people who work there, the keepers, educational officers, each one of them are so nice! They're family. Absolutely love spending time with the beard and the elephants.. it's a great great opportunity to give them a part of myself by volunteering with them.I totally recommend all those who are reading it to please go there, there's so much to learn from them and you'll just love it! Great work guys. ❤️❤️"
Amazing people doing amazing things!,"My husband and I have just returned from volunteering with a friend for 10 days at Wildlife SOS, India, and would recommend it to anyone for an experience of a lifetime! The guys here work tirelessly to keep the rescued Bears and Elephants (and any other needy animal!) safe and happy in their new lives. The volunteer house is brilliantly run and the education officers take great care to make you feel safe, informed and part of the WSOS family. (Huge shout out to Vijay, Shivam, Harry and many others for looking after us and making the hard work such fun!)The work done here is valuable beyond words, each and every person involved loves their animals and it is a lifestyle not a job for them - these are not fluffy pets and require the highest level of care and attention which they receive 24/7. Please support this amazing charity and consider them for a holiday like no other. Please also take a few minutes of your time to check out the 'refuse to ride' campaign and be informed before you engage in any tourism involving animals. It's never ok and it ALWAYS involves the fear and abuse of the animals. WSOS has achieved so much to eradicate the dancing bear practice in India and rescue circus and temple Elephants from a life of neglect and misery. Everyone we met continues to be committed to the future of Indian wildlife and importantly, the future of the young people who can effect more change from these old, outdated and barbaric traditions. From what we have seen, the future in great hands ❤"
Wildlife sos day visit,Visited Wildlife SOS and saw the fantastic and tireless work that the volunteers and staff undertake at the Sloth bear and Asiatic Elephants sanctuaries. Would definitely recommend anyone to pay a visit here to highlight the plight and persecution that these poor animals suffer   to supposedly entertain people and make a living out of this barbaric practise. Please never undertake elephant rides anywhere in the world and ensure that tourist authorities are told that this is unacceptable for tourist entertainment to hopefully one day ensure that these animals lead a peaceful existence.
Bucket List worthy - better than any ride!!!,"My husband and I visited for three days in October of this year as volunteers.  The Volunteer house is better than all of the hotels we stayed at while in India.  Food included and helpful, English speaking staff on site.The Elephant Conservation Center houses all their stars, including Raju (the Elephant rescued on Independence Day who cried when they removed his chains) and Gajraj.This is a truly once in a lifetime experience!!!!!  We participated in chopping food (15 kg each elephant plus fodder) in the mornings, filling their fodder baskets, bathing the elephants (daily and required by Indian law) observing the treatment of the various ailments, cleaning the pools and in the afternoon we participated in the walk where the elephants were free to be elephants outside of their large enclosuresIf you love Elephants, or even just like them... Seeing them at peace and happy where they have freedom to choose how they spend their days is a blessing.  We saw other Elephants on our trip in the city and countryside.  Always with a mahout who had an ankush or cane. Always with weight on their back or giving rides.  These Elephants were clearly sad or traumatized.  Isn't it better to have your tourist dollars help instead of hurt???  At Wildlife SOS, we got the experience of a lifetime and everything that we participated in was to help the elephants and the Elephants are free from abuse and the pain of being afraid.Even if you don't think that you would be able to tell the difference, trust us....you can.Thank you."
This was a dream come true,After years of following wildlife sos on Facebook my daughter and I had the privilege of visiting from Australia. The staff here do an amazing job and the elephants are so individual and unique in their personalities. Thank you for having us!
Beyond expectations,"I have been following Wildlife Sos for many years!It was a great pleasure being in Mathura in Elephant Conversation and Care Center!The way people care for elephants,looking after them,healing their bodies and souls is beyond expectations!You can see how much the elephants trust them despite decades of being abused!You can see their facilities,you can feed them and the best of all you can walk with them and see them free enjoying their walks as they should!I heard them trumpeting calling their friend to come closer,feeling happy and calm!It was amazing!!!You will also learn that behind an elephant who gives rides to people,who has to stand for people to paint him,who is a slave in a circus,there is an abused animal,beaten and tortured!Visit the center and you will have the time of your life!!!"
"Great experience, great fun!!","I spent 3 days volunteering with Wsos in both the Bear and Elephant Sanctuary and couldn’t recommend it higher! It was great getting to know what they’re all about and what an amazing job they’re doing for both the bears and elephants. I helped out with daily tasks like preparing and feeding, cleaning out enclosures, washing the elephants and even got to go for a walk with some of the elephants as well. On top of this incredible experience I also received three delicious meals a day by their in-house cooks which was by far some of the best food I’ve tasted in India. I also went back to a lovely, clean and welcoming volunteer house after each day. The staff are very friendly and made me feel part of the team. Not enough people know about this truly amazing organisation but they really should! If you are visiting Agra, forget the Taj Mahal, this is the place to go- you won’t be disappointed!!"
Wildlife SOS - Elephant Rescue,"An outstanding facility that aims to save the majestic elephant from pain and suffering and re-skill the individuals and groups that have relied on these animals to maintain an income. Our tour company mixed up our booking, however, the staff at the centre were very accommodating. Narendra Singh was our host and his passion for the cause was admirable. They have the capacity to host overseas volunteers and are keen for people to join their cause. This is a non-profit organisation so the entry fee and purchases support their worthwhile facility. During the visit you are up close and personal with these creatures - so glad we made the effort to get there."
Amazing,Our visit to the bear sanctuary today was great. Very eye opening. To see the work and help this organization provides for the sloth bears and many other animals is amazing! Our guide was very knowledgeable and passionate about his work. The bears were so happy which was so good to see!! We had a great time and would highly recommend this to anyone who visits Agra!
Really amazing,This place is one if it's kind.  I got to know after visiting them that they are the largest bear rescue center in the world. Also they have elephant rescue center.
Amazing sanctuary doing beautiful work!!,"I literally cannot recommend this place enough, the guys down at the elephant sanctuary are knowledgeable and attentive. Every minute you spend there leaves you broken hearted at the abuse suffered by these amazing Indian elephants. We spent the day with Shivam, he was clearly very passionate about his role at the sanctuary and has inspired us to promote the good work at animal SOS from England. The animal SOS company have a office in London so for anyone looking to make a difference from overseas this is something you should look into. The Agra elephant sanctuary truly is an amazing facility doing wonderful things with very little funds.me and my partner intend to help preserve this facility through monthly donations. Anyone who is moved by there stories please contact the charity and help relieve India's elephants, bears and snakes from suffering! Jonny and Gemma"
Going to Goa,"We’re going to Goa in January for 6 weeks for a holiday,and would love to go to wildlife rescue centre to see the elephants and also would like to see Taj Mahal the day afterFlying from Goa to Delhi and train to Agra,how far is it from train station and how much would it cost about.would it be best to organise it our self .would be grateful for any advice"
Absolute recommendation,"Wildlife SOS saves elephants (but also bears and other animals) from captivity and offers species-appropriate accommodation (for most of the animals kept in captivity it is not possible anymore to set then free); including healthy nutrition, huge enclosures as well as long walks on a grassland just right next door. You will first get an introduction of the organisation, then you'll walk with the elephants in the grassland and at the end you can also feed the elephants. It was a very lovely day for me!Staff is very nice, well trained and will answer all your questions. Please go there and support their projects!"
Amazing!,"We visited the elephant centre on Wednesday and spent the whole day with the staff and elephants; learning and being educated on the incredible work Wildlife SOS undertakes. We then spent Thursday morning at the bear rescue facility for a shorter but nonetheless amazing visit. All the staff have amazing knowledge of animals and are very willing to share their information with you besides answering any questions. We were really impressed by how sustainable this NGO is; they ensure that when the animals have been rescued that their previous owners are also educated, given vocational training or employment and offered the opportunity of a clean slate. They actually care about the community besides the animals and recognise that tackling animal mistreatment and cruelty in India requires an understanding of why people feel compelled to do so in the first place (particularily so with bears whose owners were often not rich; rather they were just trying to make a living). Both centers also have fantastic, clean facilities; we were very well taken care off with refreshments included also. If you are looking for a grassroots, honest and educating experience please get in touch with Wildlife SOS- what we experienced exceeded our expectations and we are confident that future visitors will be equally impressed and mesmerized not only by the animals but also by the fantastic work being done by Wildlife SOS. So much more that could be said but go and see it all for yourself!!"
Volunteering,"Love elephants?  This is the trip for you.  These animals have had a really hard time but now they live in what can only be described as an Elephant hotel.  The dedication shown by the staff -at the Elephant Care centre in Mathura, Agra is a privelege to witness.  Volunteering (I stayed for a week) is hard work but nothing like the efforts the staff go to to care for these majestic animals.  Food is great and the experience is a once in a lifetime one."
Good noble cause,Great Wildlife SoS having multiple animals captivated who have been on their own at very young age - loved the visit.
Elephants and bears,"Yesterday we visited the elephant conservation and care centre as well as the Agra bear sanctuary and it was amazing! To see those beautiful animals up close and knowing they are so well cared for after such cruelty is so heart warming. The guides are so knowledgable and happy to answer any questions we asked. It’s a must do and I would advise anyone to go along, donate and hear about the amazing work they continue to do."
Dedicated to rescuing India’s precious wildlife,My husband and I had the pleasure of visiting wildlifesos as volunteers for a few days and it was a fabulous and humbling experience to be in the presence of animals who had every reason to distrust humans and yet were peaceful to be around. We hope to go back in the future.
An emotional yet inspiring morning. Well worth visiting ,"Such a moving morning spent at the elephant and then the sloth bear sanctuaries. Inspiring work to bring comfort and succour to these rescued animals. I left completely moved by what I had seen and heard, and in awe of the brilliant efforts of Wildlife SOS."
Best thing we did in Agra!,"Geat place to visit. We have been at the Elephants wildlifesos. Very interesting, enriching and exciting experience. It just fills you with great feeling from the inside."
Elephant sanctuary Agra,"What an amazing experience, from the moment we got there till the end. These elephants are really well looked after. They have been through a lot and will never be set out into the wild but this place gives these beautiful creatures hope of a better life than they were in. When in Agra and have time this place is a must. Well done everyone who helps these elephants at SOS Wildlife 😍😍"
Unique experience & informative,"This is a unique place for wildlife experience.The beers are kept with politeness and extra care in their natural environment to grow up and stay healthy.Doctor Raja,a south indian personally,who take care of all thing,is very much helpful for visitors, specially chiodren and give important information about rehavitation of beers.A short fild which you can see,is good enough to see how the work has been done.It is very near to Agra and anyone can go their by taxi or auto from Agra.The popular name of this place is Keetham,and it is a big lake there in which you can see migratted birds for all world in winter."
Wonderful Visit with Elephants!,"We loved our time at the Wildlife SOS Center. We learned about the elephants, got to walk them, and feed them! Would highly recommend - great to see a safe place for elephants!"
More memorable than the Taj,"I toured both the sloth bear and elephant sanctuaries run by Wildlife SOS on the same day. The experiences – especially interacting with the elephants - were more memorable to me than visiting the Taj Mahal. Each of these sanctuaries is worth visiting for the opportunity to see these animals up close. Wildlife SOS does commendable work and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the care of and challenges facing both species in India. Walking with and feeding the elephants was a highlight of my entire month in India. Everyone should visit the elephant sanctuary before thinking about riding an elephant (you shouldn’t) as the life of a captive elephant is often unbearably cruel and inhumane. I’m thankful for the work of Wildlife SOS in rescuing, rehabilitating and caring for these magnificent creatures, and all they do for India's wildlife."
Amazing - Elephant Sanctuary site nr Mathura,"Today we visited the Elephant Sanctuary ran by Wildlife SOS. Located just off the NH2 near Mathura, was a well worth visit! We arrived for the morning visit (between 9am - 11am) during our trip to Delhi from Agra. There are 3  slots available (2 hours length starting 9am, 11am and 3pm) make sure you phone up beforehand to book and check availability. As we arrived the elephants were returning from their morning 3hr walk and it was nice to see  how open and peaceful the area they have for this is. We were combined with another 2 visitors for the tour and our guide was great. He was very informative and knowledgeable about all aspects of the projects they are working on and about the individual elephants.If you are concerned about visiting an elephant site that genuinely has the best intentions of the elephants at heart then this is definitely worth going and by doing so, giving your support. Their priority is to care and treat these abused elephants in the best possible way and this is reflected in the tour considerably. The actions this organisation are taking to improve, rescue and protect these gentle giants is phenomenal. Their efforts are truly making a difference. Well worth your support and a visit."
Rated in top five experiences of my life,"Spent three days volunteering at Wildlife SOS bear and elephant sanctuaries, much to my regret. I wish I could have stayed much longer and will definitely do so in the future. From initial greeting to final fair well I was made to feel part of the team, and the education I received was beyond anything I could have hoped for.  Could speak for days on the animals, absolutely loved them all, from the gentle Phoolkali to cheeky Peanut and brave Susie all the elephants made my heart sing!!  And of course can't forget Johnnie bear !!!!!  If you ever get the chance to visit ,even for a one day tour of the facilities,  I guarantee you will forever be touched by the dedication and commitment of all the staff, and will walk away with truly magnificent memories."
Mother Teresa of Animal Conservation,"These guys are really angels who protect and care for Bears and Elephants! Animals are taken care of nicely and all those saved from cruel circus and torture centres! Excellent work Karthik and Geeeta, You ROCK!"
Wild life SOS,Amazing group of people doing life saving work. It's an experience to learn n help these animals who have spent most of thier life's in captivity.
Rewarding Tour,This is a great way to spend a morning or afternoon while visiting Agra.  It was about 40 minutes away from Agra.  We hired a personal driver and had him wait while we were there.  It was about $30 for transport there.  The elephants were getting their daily baths while we were there and seemed to be quite content.  We were able to feed one of the elephants.  It was nice to see people so dedicated to helping these beautiful animals have a better life.  I'm very glad we spent our time and money here instead of a more hands on (painting/riding) place that uses inhumane methods to keep the animals docile.
Words Fail Me which isn't often!,"We visited both the bear and elephant sanctuary which was full of emotion for me.  We are in complete awe of what Kartick and Geeta, the co-founders have accomplished against all odds.  The sloth bears have been rescued from a life of misery, being made to dance on two legs which just isn't natural but they now looked happy and content with their lives.  Likewise with the rescued elephants. No more abuse and cruelty and chains They can now roam the fields free and they are very content with their life but this wasn't always the case.Before visiting the bears we were shown a film of a baby being ripped away from its mother, who was killed by the poacher) and then without any anesthetic, a hot metal rod was pushed through its soft muzzle, when the baby passed out with pain.  When it woke it found it now had a muzzle and rope through its nose.We saw an equally distressing video on how the elephants were treated, and in particular ""Raju the Crying Elephant"" This reduced both myself, my husband and an Australian Male Doctor to tears.  He was brutalised, dragged across the ground on his knees to make him co-operate Another elephant with him (it could have been Mohan) was distressed also.  All this so that he would work, beg or give rides to tourists.  Wildlife SOS are doing all they can to rescue more elephants from their lives of abuse and cruelty but without mine and your help by making donations this will be impossible.The food bill alone to feed 20 elephants and 400 bears (the latter love honey which even in India is an expensive commodity) must give them sleepless nights and that is before medical supplies etc.I have now seen first hand where your's and my money goes and it is 100% on the animals.  All I can say is ""Wildlife SOS keep up the good work"" and to all of you reading this review keep up your donations and if you haven't yet donated, please consider it.  Even the smallest amount would helpMy final advice ""NEVER EVER RIDE AN ELEPHANT - Under that highly coloured cloth and paint are the wounds inflicted by bullhooks so that he will co-operate. I have seen these wounds first hand - it is heartbreaking;"
Elephant park,"Great and amazing park, i went with my friends and dis a voluntad work there. I would suggest you to visit It.Vale la pena."
Was not as impressed as the rest of you...,"I wasn’t impressed.  We were herded into a mobile unit with no air at over 115f outside.  Hotter inside- to show a film about elephant abuse.  I didn’t care to see it and left the room.  HUGE pressure to go back inside.  Felt FORCED and had to continually refuse to enter.  The elephants do not have land to roam on- they are restricted to cages but lead out each day for a walk. Really wanted donations or purchase of tee shirts, etc to fund them.  I didn’t like the tactics. Those who watched said the film was graphic.  Beware with children.  Be prepared for dust storms."
Fabulous!,Amazing place and despite a brief interruption from a hefty dust storm they still made sure we got to feed the elephants! Great people and a wonderful cause!
Well worth making and taking time for a visit,"Four of us travelled from Delhi to visit the Bear and Elephant Sanctuaries in one day. A long, hot day, and we almost missed the (we thought) badly-positioned 'WSOS' Bear Sanctuary Sign along the roadside (the signage needs to be clearer in relation to the access off the main road, the Bird Sanctuary, etc) but all was very rewarding when we finally got there. The dedication, care and concern of the Wildlife SOS Teams for the rescued bears is wonderful to see, and offers real delight as you witness how the bears are clearly happy and responding to good food, care and human affection. Do keep a camera with you - we were given a chance to take photos in one place even if it says you can't take photos generally (it might frighten the bears). Wear walking shoes as well - some 271 types of snake inhabit the same forest you are walking in!Try to go in the less hot part of the day as the bears tend to stay in the shade or down out of sight in the real heat. The centre is very well arranged and set up, with friendly, thoughtful staff only too happy to answer questions and show you around - and great fun as the bears snuffle your scent through the wire!"
Super,"What an amazing experience! You can tell that they really care about the elephants. They all seemed really happy. Animal abuse is no joke, any place that allows you to ride or paint the elephants is not for the elephants. I hope to come back and volunteer here at some point. Everyone that works here is working hard for animal rights, so proud to have supported such an ethical organization."
Worth the excursion!,This is a must see if you care about and wish to learn how to protect the majestic elephants of India.
A real eye opener at wildlifeSOS,"Julia and I visited the elephants and we learnt so much about the terrible cruelty of the wonderful animals. Up close with the rescued elephants you could feel the love and care being taken to give them happy lives, a million miles away from the circuses,wedding accessories, and private toys of rich businessmen . We watched them being fed,washed medically cared for. Then we went to the sloth bear sanctuary which showed equally how wildlifeSOS are giving the lives back to these animals who have been used for human entertainment with such cruelty. Please visit both places and spread the word and support this charity that is not funded by the government."
awesome day!,"I love and admire elephants since I was a child and I feel sad about all the circuses and elephant rides. When I found out about wildlife SOS I knew that it is the ""must see"" in India.At first, they gave us information about the organisation. Then we visited the elephants and were told how each elephant get in the sanctuary, about their history. Later, we prepared custom made snacks for each elephant - bucket full of vegetables and fruits. Then we fed them with the vegetables and fruits :) We also washed them - that was kind of hard because of their firm skin and we finished the day with walk with two of them.I was happy, that I got into contact with elephants without causing them harm in any way. Please visit wildlife SOS instead of riding elephants. You will get unforgettable experience and the good feeling by helping. I would love to come back someday, but not just for one day."
An unforgettable experience!,"This Sanctuary was one of the highlights of our trip to India! Originally, we were considering going on an elephant ride before learning about how harmful that can be to the elephants. Fortunately, we found Wildlife SOS and our visit was an experience we’ll never, ever forget! They do fantastic work and had deep knowledge on each elephant's past as well as their preferences (for example they even knew what food each elephant likes, doesn't, etc).They go to great lengths to make sure these rescued elephants don’t have to deal with horrifying experiences again, and by visiting and making a donation you contribute to the great work they do in addition to learning a lot. You can do a 2 hour visit or volunteer for longer. If you’re checking out the Taj Mahal, it’s less than an hour from there and absolutely worth the visit!"
PLEASE DO THIS!!,"I visited the Elephant SOS in Agra because I was on a private tour who had scheduled an elephant ride and I kind of pitched a fit that the company was promoting riding elephants ;-) So I did some research and instead made them take me to the Wildlife SOS sanctuary.  So many elephants in captivity are so poorly treated and they are intelligent, empathetic creatures, I wanted to do my part to promote awareness while in India. I had a lovely time at the facility - myself and two Canadian girls. We were given an extensive tour of the facility and had lots of opportunities to interact with the elephants (without riding them). I was hoping we might get to bathe them, but this sounds like a morning activity (please keep in mind if that's of interest). Would recommend in a heart beat - please support this NGO!"
A beautiful experience,"This was a once in a lifetime experience. Wildlife SOS are a wonderful organisation who work to help and rehabilitate elephants who have sustained injuries. The team clearly care and love the elephants and it was a delight to see so much passion for these beautiful animals. Bima, our tour guide, was very knowledgeable and accommodating despite a mix-up with our arrival time. We got to meet the elephants, walk with them, feed them, see how their food is prepared. Well-worth the trip from Delhi.Only disappointment: the taxi they had arranged to pick us up/drop us back to Agra was extremely expensive. We were not aware of this when we booked it, but after being in Delhi for a few days realised this was an extortionate price. Our driver was rude and dropped us off at the wrong location on the way back. BOOK YOUR OWN TAXI!"
