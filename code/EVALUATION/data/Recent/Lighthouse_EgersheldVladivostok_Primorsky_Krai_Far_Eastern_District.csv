Windswept path to Lighthouse,I wanted to visit once again the Egersheld lighthouse.  It was a sunny cold January day.  It was possible to walk to the lighthouse.  But the wind was so cold and strong.  Locals were doing some races on ice on off-road vehicles.
Most intereseting,A short drive from the town center - and a short walk. Freezing cold in the midst of winter though! But definitely worth it!
Another popular tourist spot.,"After our wedding in Vladi, my wife took us there for a walk.Not really suitable for wheelchairs.Very popular with tourists."
Romantic walk at dusk,We walked out along the cape at dusk. It was a beautiful time of day to take a walk. The light was magical.  When the tide is out you can actually walk to the lighthouse and locals swim around it.
You Get What You See,"Car parking is terrible, go early if you driveAccess to the lighthouse is via a rocky road cum breakwater surrounded by crystal clear COLD sea water. The locals love to bathe in the sun lying on the pebble beach on the sea side, there is no sand per se.What you don't see in the picture is the giant steel transmission tower which greets you at the end of the rocky road just next to the lighthouse"
Wet Your Feet in the Western Pacific,"To get to Tokarevsky Cape, you will feel like you've been to the final frontier. Located at the end of a spit at the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, the lighthouse heralds the entrance ot Vladivostok harbor, Russia's Far Eastern port.Standing here, you are closer to Korea, China and Japan than Moscow. Even though I was here in summer, the wind was howling and it was cold and rainy. I was thankful for my Goretex boots to keep my feet dry.If you have time, I highly recommend making a pit stop at the Octopus Cafe located just a few hundred yards before the parking lot to the lighthouse."
Nice view,"A shooting scene of a Chinese film so visited this place when we still had time. Can take bus route 59, 60, 81 to 'Маяк' bus terminal. Then either walk about 20 minutes but we took a Yandex taxi for <100rub."
10 minute walk from the parking lot,"The road is safe but narrow and not paved, so it may not be the easiest for elderly. When I visited it was raining a bit and extremely windy, making it rather cold.The lighthouse is small and you cannot enter it. It isn't a ""must visit"", particularly if the weather is bad. I saw a fair amount of other tourists, so it can get a bit crowded."
Lighthouse ,"It is a relatively small lighthouse, but is supposed to mark the end of land and the beginning of the sea. It gets pretty crowded in good weather."
must go,"One of those really attractive places - the view is beautiful. One can reach old lighthouse during low water time and enjoy gazing at Russian bridge, Golden Horn strait, Russian Island and Amursky bay.  The only disappointing thing is that the passage has just recently been blocked for cars, so that one is forced to take a really bad road risking to have his/her legs broken."
The lighthouse to visit in winter,Having the cold and windy weather would allow to have your privacy to enjoy the majesty of the spot. Make your visit at the time of dusk or down to have the proper light for your pictures.
Good visit,Good to check out...really cold when we were there but definitely worth seeing when you’re in town..
Pretty Spot - Pleasant to Visit,Enjoyed the walk out to the lighthouse on the spit.  It wasn't underwater when we went as shown in the photo.  It was a lovely view of the bay and great people watching as well.
Such a romantic place,"This place is so beautiful and romantic. I wanna go back there. Go there soak yourself in the sunlight and have some good loving, relaxing and fun time. Don't forget to carry your best swimsuit. You may like to have some dashing photo shoot session too.This is one of the best place I have visited till date in my life. Highly recommended."
Nice place,"Is a nice place to visit, you can have a bath at the sea here, even though is all with stones but the water temperature in August is very mild and nice"
A must visit place for Trans Siberian railroad riders,"If you came to Vladivostok by train from Moscow, this is the traditional ending point of the trip, because this is ""as far as you can go"". If you go at summer, get ready to wet your feet, because the passing vessels will raise waves that will flush over the narrow and shallow path to the lighthouse. The lighthouse itself is nothing much to see, but of course the views from there are great."
Must visit place in VVO,"If you visit VVO, one of the places where you must to go. Of course summer better time to saw that spot. Near you can find street food and coffee spot. From VVO Rail way station but number 62, 63,"
"If you are short of time, skip this one",Our guide took us here and said it was the easternmost point on mainland Russia. But other than that fact there's not much there there. The lighthouse is miniature and can't be accessed and the views are usually fog shrouded. I'd pass on this one.
A good walk,Worth a visit if you manage to avoid the bus loads of annoying tourists who are noisy and disrespectful of the environment
beautiful place!,"Bus no. 59, 60, 62 will take u to that area and you need to walk at least 20 minutes to the lighthouse. Lucky we can get a taxi to town on the way out. There is no public toilet available in the lighthouse."
Worth a hike,I hiked out to this lighthouse but you can get a bus at flat rate fee of 23R one way with a short walk from the terminal. It does make you feel that you are well out of the city and gives you a chance to get some fresh air. The water is clean and I am told people do swim in the summer.
Stunning view,"Despite of the weather conditions, it is a spot that will not leave you indifferent. Remember to be ready with warm clothes (can be very windy!!!)"
Lighthouse Egersheld（Маяк Эгершельд ) Visit Report,"Lighthouse Egersheld（Маяк Эгершельд ) Visit Report(google: Mayak Tokarevskiy. / Маяк Токаревский)Date of visit: 17 Feb 208 14:00Sunny but very windy , -10'cI take bus no. 60 at bus stop ""Seraya loshad"" on Ulitsa Aleutskaya(street). The bus stop is about 7 mins from the railway station. The 60 bus route has a frequent schedule. I waited about 10mins at the bus stop.The bus ride from Vladivostok city centre to the light house (get off at the last stop) took about 20 mins.A few other bus routes share the same terminus.The light house is about 15 mins on foot from the bus stop. Along the way there is a gas station, to which a EcoMarket is attached. Inside the convenient store, there are toilets (free of charge) as well as 2 tables with seats. You may refresh yourself before going to the lighthouse, especially in winter.It was windy and very cold during my visit. Even the sea water freezed. It felt like my eye balls were freezing...Make sure you dress enough and have something to cover your head and ears, if in winter.Will I go again? The view is fantastic. Next time I'll probably do it in summer. :)"
Winter amazing!,A small lighthouse it may be though the view out to sea and the harbour of Vladivostok  stunning. To get there I used Explore Primorye travel and would highly recommend them
Sunset over the pacific ,Beautiful place to end the day at any time if the year. Great sunset and you can walk right up to the end of just chill near by and watch the sun go down with a drink.
Visit early in the morning to get a great photo,"My son and I visited the lighthouse on our last day in Vladivostok. We took the 6:30am bus from he city. at the Seraya loshad bus stop. The bus stop is on Aleutskaya Street, a five minute walk from Central square.The popular buses that ply this route are # 59,60,62 and 81. It was a 15 minute trip, and 10 bus stops from town. The fare was 20 rubles. The last stop is at Anna  Shchetinina Park, which is recommended for a short visit, as there are great views of the Bay and Russky Island Bridge from here. Note that after arriving at the Park, which is 4km south of the city, you will still have a 2km walk to the lighthouse.After exiting the bus walk in a southerly direction, and past the bus terminus on the right hand side. All buses turn around at this section, for the return journey into the city. Walk up a slight slope , and a gas station will come into view on your left, and a tall apartment complex on your right.The remainder of the walk is downhill and quite easy. A few more minutes and the lighthouse, and power grid will be seen below. There area few places along the route where you can clamber up the bank and take photos of the lighthouse in the distance. There are a few side roads on the right, but stay to the left as this is the general direction of the lighthouse.At the bottom of the hill is a paved food and beverage area, which has coin vending drink machines. There are a few benches, and fixed binoculars where coins can be inserted for a view of the harbour. Keep walking past the power grid, and on the narrow path to the lighthouse. The path was almost completely covered when we visited. We took quite a few photos here with the lighthouse in the background, and a few photos next to the lighthouse. We were the only visitors at this time. By the time that we decided to leave the strip was entirely covered and we got the best photo, which appeared to show my son walking on water.We then relaxed on the benches in the parking area, and watched sea gulls and the boats in the harbour. The walk back is a little more difficult, as you will now be going uphill. We got a bus at the park, and were back in town by 8:30am. If you are an early riser and do not mind a bit of a stroll in the morning, this will be an unforgettable experience. Remember to bring some bread for the fish and seagulls, as we regretted this error This was one of the most memorable experiences on our trip."
Beautiful stroll to see the bay of Vladivostok ,Lovely walk to the lighthouse to blow away the cobwebs. Good spot for photographs and a little tranquility
Landmark - Historic Site,"Though not much is done to preserve this lighthouse which is covered on high tide by a causeway, its historical and a good place to see, a great place to see the harbour and the occasional Russian naval ship."
Quiet Spot,"For a slight change of flavor within easy driving distance from the main city, a short stop here is an option.  Local food vendors, and a small restaurant are located here."
As If Walking on Water!,"In planning our trip, I added seeing this lighthouse to the must see list. This was an amazing experience for my daughter and me. We were able to walk on the path to the lighthouse. We were splashed a bit-but that added to the experience. I would highly recommend this to visitors with a sense of adventure."
nice walk and view,Everything is big in Russia but Vladivostok Light house! it's quite a walk from the bus stop but you can enjoy the view on the bay.  some restaurants are near the lighthouse where you can eat good fish dishes. Bring your swimsuit to enjoy a swim.
The last point of Russia,Anyway not so much nice places in this foggy and expensive town. But this is the one u need to be. There is nice view to Russkiy island and the most expensive russian bridge.
Magnificent place💙,"It's like a piece of pure nature in the city- clean blue waves, smell of the sea, freedom... and the majestic lighthouse. Must see in Vladivostok."
Good view. ,A light house is a famous place in Vladivostok. Tourist and local go there to take a nap and take a photo. The place is a little bit far from town. There is not thing to do but chilling around the beach and lighthouse. It's is a bit windy over there.
Small Lighthouse,"Its a small Lighthouse a bit far from anything else worth doing. And takes a good 30min to get there and then you just walk out, see the water, take a picture and head back."
Amazing walk here surrounded by frozen waters in March,We visited here as part of a day tour with Explore Primoyre and it was just a spectacular time of year - March so frozen water all around and a beautiful sunny day
Can get windy,Went there durring the day and it is a place many locals love to go to. Apparently during the summer it's pavked with people so it was nice to have the place (more or less) for our selfs. But it was quite windy and we got cold :)But worth a visit.
Freezing in Jan,"We went there in Jan and it was freezing, but it was pretty fun!  We stood on the ice plate and took photos."
Expect the unexpected ,"I arrived with two colleagues here in Vladivostok and it was the first time for all of us.Our guest took us on a short tour while bringing us to his office and it was really breathtaking when he drove us in his 4x4 to the small lighthouse in the frozen sea.He drove it as close as possible to the lighthouse and then we went for a short walk on the narrow path.It is a small patch of land and to the left you have very thin ice and to the right a much thicker layer. So thick that you can safely walk in it. It was Amazon to see the local fishermen in action: holes drilled on the ice and fishing relentlessly.We heard about summer bathing (water temperatures can go up to 23 degrees between July and September), water sports, fishing trips.It was like being in a fisherman novel. Amazing.The view of the harbour on the left side is amazing while to the right we could see two icebreaker ships at work.Very impressive.The view of the bridge is also something not to miss.We sadly had to go back to work, however this place is a must if you happen to pass by"
Beautiful place and well worth a visit,"The little lighthouse at the end of a gravel spit is adjacent to a surfing beach (very good wind around the headland) and a popular place for the locals. A bit hard to get to without a car, but the views are spectacular!"
Romantic place ,"Hi,  this small light house is one of the beautiful places in vladivostok. In Summer you can go swimming there.    You have a perfect view to the sea and to the city."
Walking on water,"It is quite a challenge to get to the lighthouse.  First, I went all the way to the end stop of a route bus that said ""Egerscheldt"" (sorry I prefer real German spelling of this name) on a windshield.  Then I had to walk to the land's end where the locals park.  and then... the most most interesting thing - I had to walk on water.  I was a high tide.  So that strip of land was barely under water.  Everyone was following the same path.  So did I.  It reminded me of a Biblical scene."
Sunday hang out place - for locals,"We drove here - this was an experience (tiny rocky road) and took a look at this light house. Perhaps more interesting a lot of locals where hanging out here with family's, picking and bathing. It looks like they enjoyed it even more than we did"
Perfect sight to take great pictures! A must do,"There are several busses going in the direction of the lighthouse (60,62,59,...). The bus ride should cost 20 rubbles per person. You should take the stop to Mayak.After that you need to walk for around a good 25 minutes to get to the lighthouse. Check on google maps how to get there from the stop (it's pretty easy). At the location you will find some small eating stands and a bar. There is also a nice beach, but a local didn't recommend me to swim the water on that side, due to the pollution. The view you will see is magnificent if good weather (but there will be also a lot of people), but I bet it should be quite mysterious as well with some clouds. We watched the sunset from the lighthouse, it was really special..."
The little light that does,"Reached via an unsaved road, with cars parked in every available spot of land, the light house is the end point of an area used by local families for sun bathing and swimming."
Fell all winds of Far East ,"I believe that if you haven't been to the lighthouse, you haven't experienced Vladivostok at all!If you have an opportunity come there during sunset and see the sun disappearing in waters of Sea of Japan. Your hear will stay there forever..."
Tokarevsky AKA Egersheld lighthouse ,"Nice scenic spot, a bit far from bus stop, so, it's better to go by car. Lighthouse itself can be reached only during low tides. They say it's windy almost all of the times, so, you'd better have at least a scarf to put on.There's a public beach nearby with a few fast-food kiosks."
interesting place,"The lighthouse itself is nothing special but this is a nice viewpoint for giving us a stunning panorama of the whole Vladivostok harbor. When tide is high, the road which is passed from land to the lighthouse will be submerged. If you haven't been back from the lighthouse just-in-time, you will have no way to be back to the land and have to wait for. It's interesting. There are a lot of locals who go there for swimming even though sea water is pretty cold on May."
"Fresh air, nice view",Attraction for both tourists and locals. People come with kids to walk and make good fotos. One of places to visit in VVO.
"Amazing scenery, cute little lighthouse. ","Cute little lighthouse, but the day we went we were offered a rare phenomenon of frozen waves on shore and together with this gorgeous sunset, it was the highlight of our trip !"
Much ado about very little,There is not a lot to do or see in Vladivostok so anything at all gets blown a bit out of proportion.
Good,After driving 20 minutes or something we arrived there.The weather was a bit raniy and the way to go to The Lighthouse under the sea..So we werent able to walk there...But its good place.Im sure its a good place when the weather is sunny and also good place to swim and forsurfing...
Tokarevsky Mayak - Lighthouse in Vladivostok,"Excellent location for sight seeing, very popular with wedding photography parties also.Tiny peninsula right out in the bay, with excellent views.Plenty of parking place available."
Nice small way...,I went Russia last year.. And i got lighthouse ategersheld cape. It's very nice and have nice view. It's good for photographers.. It's very nice.
"Romantic place, a viewcard of the city","This place has the spirit of the city, it's a mix of something a bit tough and lonesome, but at the same time caring, waiting for the ships to come home. A good place to visit in the evening, when stars, lights of the city and the waves and unique smell of the ocean (it's the place where Japanese sea flows into Pacific ocean) gives you a very special feeling of light and kind melancholy."
very romantic,"I am a great fan of the sea and all that is associated with it: the ships with sails, islands, and... of course,the lighthouses. This is a beautiful lighthouse which is very easy to get to."
An interesting spot in winter,"Visiting the lighthouse in the middle of winter was really interesting.  The frozen ocean surrounded the path and provided the opportunity to watch ice fishing take place.  Some melted and broken areas also had a family of 8 seals swimming and fishing around, keeping an eye on us as we watched them.The lighthouse itself is small and nothing spectacular, but the setting itself and the view back to the city and bridge makes the trip worth it.  A nice experience"
Impressive lighthouse,Went there on the final day to see this lighthouse. Apparently it's a great place to go in the summer. But it wasn't summer....
Wrong location 位置非常不準,"The navigation tools useless, always point to wrong location."
Love it!,"I love this place, especially in winter, when the sea is frozen to ice and the seals seat around on the blocks of ice and dive into the water..."
A must see place in Vladivostok,"If you ever visit this small city, then this a place you should definitely visit. It is about 10 min walk from the last bus stop."
