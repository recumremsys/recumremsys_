Ancient Temple,"This ancient temple of Shiva is located Mardol in Ponda district. This deity is a kuladevata of many SB and GSB community residing in Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra.If you are in this area on a Monday don't miss the Palaki Ustav and night Pooja which starts at 10 PM. goes on for an hour or so."
Hindu Devotional Temple,"It's a good place for hindu devotional followers. Nothing much on architecture of temple, it's normal."
"Lord Mangueshi, an incarnation of Lord Shiva","We were told that Lord Mangueshi is recognized as Lord Shiva only in the regions of Goa. Shri Mangueshi Temple is situated in the Ponda Taluka at a place called Priol. The distance of the Mangueshi temple from Panaji is 22 km.Mythology says that Lord Shiva had once visited the land distraught after losing heavily to his wife Parvati at a game of dice. As Goddess Parvati came looking for him, he tried to prank her by shape shifting into a tiger and frightening her. Seeing the predator in front of her, Parvati shrieked and prayed uttering the following words Trahi Mam Grisha, roughly translated this means “O Lord of the Mountains, save me”. Upon hearing her plea Shiva reverted to his usual form and returned to Kailash with her.Shiva came to be known as Lord Manguesh due Parvati’s words Mam Grisha that remains associated with the land and the tale. The original location where the temple was built is presently the location of village Cortalim, located at the south of the Zuari River. It was during the Portuguese invasion that the deity was shifted Priol, where it remains till this day."
Fantastic Temple ,During our visit to Goa happened to visit this nice temple which is built on 15th century. We had a very good Darshan. One of the few temples Built and lasted in Goa since the the Portuguese / Christian Era where they destroyed a lot of Hindu temples.
Beautiful Temple with a lots of shops nearby,One thing I noticed here is this this temple doesn't appear like a temple. The architecture of this temple is very unique and looks like a Portuguese church. The Blue and yellow colors make it more vibrant. The shopping area near this temple is much cheaper as compared to other places in Goa

Clean Temple,I visited this place once in 1988 and now in 2019. No rush for Darshan. Also note shorts are not allowed to enter into the temple. They give some kind of cloth/Dhoti to wrap around and then you can enter. Its free of cost.
Nice Holy place,Divine place with divine shiva blessings. Nice place to worship lord shiva in village of legendary lata mangeshkar ji.
Could've been better.,This was a second visit to our family deity. We were lucky to be there for the afternoon Aarti. The security guards inside the temple were very rude to devotees and with the priests shout if you stand in front of the deity for a bit longer. This does make the experience unpleasant.
Divine place,"It is one of the biggest temples in Goa. Must visit if you are in Goa to get the blessings of God Shiva. Very beautiful temple. There used to be an ancient one at another location but it was destroyed by the Portuguese invaders during Goa inquisition. Somebody managed to hide the idol at the current location. This was a farm labourer called Mulkeshwar. You will find his temple behind the main temple. He used to smoke bidi, so devotees offer him bidi and is considered a form of the God himself.Temple also has a nice canteen where you can enjoy local vegetarian food right from breakfast to dinner."
Nice feeling.,Located at a nice place. We have to move arround 700 meters to visit that place. For old people it is difficult to move. The gaurd is not so co-operative to elderly.
graet,"a very spiritual place and architeture place, must see when come to goa .also visit fort aguda and holy church alsoj"
Beautiful temple and divine darshan,"The temple is situated approximately 20 kms from Panaji and is easily accessible by road. The highway is good except for a patch of around four kilometers. Ample directions available to reach the place. Google map is accurate to the T. Parking can be an issue during weekends,…"

Very big temple,"This is one of the beautiful temples of goa which attracts most go an tourists.the place is vast and house to god shiva.do carry caps,umbrella, sunglasses, sunscreen, water as it takes a lot of time for Darsham due to the huge crowd here."
Nice place,The place is good and nice to have a visit.It is a nice place and good time pass.It is maintained well.
Shri Mangeshi Temple,"Shri Mangeshi Temple located at Mangeshi Village in Priol, Ponda taluk of Goa is one of the largest and most visited temple in Goa. It is a must visit if you are in Goa. Also the stalls near by the road leading to the Temple sells varieties of items that one can buy as a souvenier or gift to family and friends....and the price are also cheap...as compared to other parts of Goa. The stalls nearby beach are very costly and the prices here are half of those of beach stalls....but I learned it the hard way...."
Supreme.,"We had to go a bit far looking for this temple but once we reached there found it so serene and so beautiful. It is very old temple and connected to Goan History. Contrary to my belief the place is not owned by Lata Mangeshkar Family but about 12 families made this temple. They have a canteen also that serves very nice, home made food on very subsidized rates. We had meal there as well."
Must visit,If you are in Goa you must visit this temple. Beautiful temple. There is a dress code for girls. They have to wear decent cloths.
The abode of Lord Shiva,"Its a very beautiful temple on a hill top. The premises is quite clean and well maintained.  Short dresses inside the temple not allowed, hence one need to be dressed appropriately. The drive to the temple is also quite good. Must visit if in Goa."
Worth A visit,"Said to have power of getting your wishes fulfilled !! A medium size temple , Well kept and orderly systems"
Nice temple,"It is one of the most famous temples in South Goa where people come from different parts of the country. The Temple structure is very old , decent  and the environment is peaceful. Able to pray in peace…… Its quite a decent  walk from the car park ….."
BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE,"One of the well maintained clean Temple and serene atmosphere.A must visit while at Goa. Easy approach, parking area available, disciplined devotee crowd."
Clean Temple,This is one of the most visited place in Goa and is considered as one of the top tourism spots in Goa ... car parking is very far but the market area  helps cover the distance with fun ...
Goa 2018,"One of the most famous temples in South Goa.Many people come from different parts of the country to visit.The Temple structure is very nice and the environment is peaceful. There are rooms built for the patrons to stay inside the campus.Have been visiting this place since childhood and unfortunately, of late I observed the sanctity of the temple is being compromised due to commercialisation."
Clean temple premises ,Worth visiting. Its quite a long walk from the car park & can be uncomfortable in the hot sun. Temple is kept clean & does not seem very commercial.
Good one to start the day,This was one of the oldest Hindu temple in Goa dedicated to lord Shiva in the form of Mangesh. Lot of devotees visited this temple. Actually we visited this temple in February end when the sun started becoming hot. The road to temple is blocked for vehicle movement so we walked. Lot of people were giving puja. We had good time.
must visit place in goa,"I visit with my family regularly, beautiful temple, they served a pure veg authentic food on the chargeable basis"
Beautiful temple of local style,"It is located on a hill and a road leads to the small stairs to the temple. It is a very modest temple like the ones in bali as they know people come to goa to chill and may not be appropriately dressed, they offer free cloth like sarong to used to cover knees. Unlike in bali where they charge a lot to rent sarongs. We felt very peaceful and calm after visiting this temple. The market on the way is also good but be aware you need to bargain big. If you are having your own vehicle drive through cortlaim village and enjoy the jetty ride as well."
Must Visit if you are in Goa,"If i am in Goa, i do visit Mangeshi as this is our kuladevata. But apart from that actually a must visit place. If possible dont miss the Palkhi which is on every Monday. It is a grand celebration. The view of the temple on this Night is simply magical. There is even place to stay within the Temple but is restricted. Its always nice to stay and since the same is built arond the temple its gives a clam and plesant feeling. Would recommend to wear clothes which cover your legs completly i.e. full pants or else will have to get the dhoti or chunni to do that as the entry is restricted with western outfit.Again the entry in the main temple very well know as ""Gabhara"" (The innermost division of temple) is restricted, however from the place from where we can see the idol gives a good view. Photography is restricted as it is in most of the temples.Non-Veg is strictly prohibited and the canteen inside the temple premises have some delicious maharashtrian delicacy. For people who would like to have the feel of some goan non-veg food if you step out of the temple there are a few eateries popularly know as ""Khanaval"" who serves authentic goan food mainly fish and sol kadi are one of my favourites. Its a home made food."
Beautiful temple,"Travelling with a group of 43 senior Citizens, we visited this temple arround 12.30 PM. After climbing about 10-12 steps, we hit the main entrrance. At the entry point, there is Bharoan temple. It's very satisfying to have blessings of the Lord. Within the temple complex, we see a high white tower, called the Garuda stambh, which is yet another attraction at the Temple complex."
Exquisite Temple,The last temple we visited was that of exquisite Mangeshi temple located on a hillock surrounded by lush green hills at Priyol just 1 km from Mardol . Here Lord Shankar sports a beard . The temple has a seven storeyed Deepstambha . Timings : 0600 to 2200 .
Shiva Temple,"This is a Shiva temple located in Ponda village. Worth a visit for its location and religious aspects, priests however are eager to extract money from tourists."
"Peace,Uncrowded and Good Food","Mangeshi temple is located near Ponda taluka of Goa, It will take around 1 hour to reach from Panjim, the road is smooth and you can go by car/2wheeler,It is old Lord Shiva temple which was saved from Portugese during their colonisation,There are other small temples around it as well.This temple is also famous for Mangeshkar sisters.You must try its kitchen food (Thali) which is very simple but will be super delicious."
Shiva Temple in Lata Mangeshkar’s Village ,"While visiting Goa, made a point to visit Mangeshi Shiva Temple. It is Situated in the village that is also famous for being the native village of melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Like all parts of Goa, the road to templetown passes through an undulating terrain though lush green hills. Given it’s a small village, local body has made sure that cars are parked outside the village access road. This leaves the last about 500 meters to walk before one reaches the main entrance of temple. Climbing about 20 odd steps, one crosses the main gate and enters the vast grounds of temple. What surprises one is the temple architecture. Unlike a traditional temple with a pointed step tower above the sanctum sanctorum,  the temple appears like a dome of a basilica. From distance, the temple appears like a church complex. Possibly, a fusion of Hindu Temple Architecture with Portuguese history and Roman Catholic Church styles. The inner hall of temple is decorated with numerous glass chandeliers - again very different from traditional Hindu temples. Temple is however very clean and environs so soothing and serene. When visiting Goa, this should be a must visit site, just like Basilica of Bom Jesus or Se Cathedral."
Historic temple with diverse architectural styles,This historic temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is a symbol of diverse historic legacy of Goa.. The temple by itself was restored several times and presents an interesting melange of architectural styles. A must see for the Hindu tourists visiting Goa.
Mangeshi temple,Very beautiful Shiv temple. Well maintained temple complex. Parking area could be managed better and the approach road is narrow. I was told by security to park at parking area which is about 500m away from temple however later I found some cars going right upto the temple.
Shiv Temple,"This temple is situation around 2 kms distance from Mahalasa temple.  This temple is one of the very famous temple of Goa. Rooms and canteen facilities are available in the premises.  Campus is very huge and we have options for shopping also.This being the Shiva temple, has maintained its sanctity. Foreigners are not allowed inside the temple. This temple has a Mangurish Mutt in the campus."
Nice Temple!!!,"Peaceful, nice and beautiful temple the best part is these temple have their water bodies, water reserver place."
Nice temple but lacks facilities,"Temple is indeed nice inside but poor facilities as one has to stand outside under the sun for atleast 30 mins as no shelter to get inside the temple. A historical background with theme of Lord Shiva and revered by the Saraswat Brahmins, well maintained for certain."
Beautiful temple,"Beautiful temple of lord Shiva. This temple is the holy diety of Saraswat Brahmins Community. It is well maintained, and community members can stay here after pre confirmation of availability of rooms. There is a small flea market outside the temple."
Very Holy Temple,"It is a Holy Temple for Saraswat Community. It is a family deity for many families. Well maintained & clean. Old temple with good architecture. Lots of Food & Drink stalls, Lots of small shops sellingvarious things. Accomodation also available"
Beautiful Temple,"We visited the temple around 12.30 pm and the sun was too hot. As we entered the premises, we found the temple so beautiful. We removed and kept our shoes in the designated place and walked barefoot towards the temple. We couldn't walk on the floor as the entire place was too hot due to heat of the sun and there was no cover to get shade. We got blisters under the feet after waiting in the sun to enter into the santum sanctorum. We prayed and came out and literally ran towards the place where our shoes were kept. Pls avoid going with small children in the afternoon to the temple. Best time is morning and evening. Temple authorities could provide a shelter where devotees wait to enter into the sanctum sanctorum."
Mangeshi Temple - Diety of GSB,"Time to spend: 1-2 hrs depending on your interest.Water and Food: Plenty of stalls offering food outside the TempleStay / Accommodation: Check with Temple Management for stay in the premisesGuide Facility: Not requiredParking Facility: Available.Dress Code : YesEntry Fee: NilShri Mangesh temple is located at Mangeshi Village in Priol, Ponda taluk, Goa. It is at a distance of 1 km from Mardol close to Nagueshi, 21 km from Panaji the capital of Goa, and 26 km from Margao. This temple is one of the largest and most frequently visited temples in Goa. In 2011, the temple along with others in the area instituted a dress code on visitors of the temple. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in murmugao which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in mormugao taluka, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Zuari  to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.  The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The main temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga.  He is the kuldevta of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins. The 450-year-old Shri Mangesh temple dedicated to Shiva stands out with its simple and yet exquisitely elegant structure. The temple architecture consists of several domes, pilasters and balustrades. There is a prominent Nandi Bull and a beautiful seven-story deepstambha (lamp tower), which stands inside the temple complex. The temple also has a magnificent water tank, which is believed to be the oldest part of the temple.  The Sabha Griha is a spacious hall which accommodates over 500. Like most temples in Goa, Mangueshi Temple has a large number of pujas being performed daily. Every morning, Shodshopchar pujas, namely Abhisheka, Laghurudra and Maharudra, are performed. This is followed by Maha-Aarti at noon and Panchopchar pooja at night. Every Monday, the idol of Manguesh is taken out for a procession in the Palakhi accompanied by music before the evening Aarti."
Good place ,Awesome place. Peaceful and silent. You should go there for pray. Nice it's in South Goa best temple.
"Lord Shiva Temple ""Mangueshi""",It was Blissfull Day but it was bit long Journey because we started traveling from South Goa after Covering Old Goa we reached Mangeshi temple around 3:00Pm It was too hot and mudy air all around. While entering the temple premises there is a domestic market where you can buy all kind of traditional dress and other stuff of Goa which will keep reminding you about Goa's memories where ever you will be In any corner of this PlanetThe Temple premises was clean and well managed main temple hall was surrounded with other buildings which looks Awesome.This was my First visit to Mangueshi Temple and I have enjoyed the Devine Energy Suggesting others too visiting here You will enjoy it to the core.Thanks Anil Thakur

temple in a quiet place,"visit this temple if you are a devout , religious person, The temple itself does not offer anything outstanding in terms of architecture or spiritual atmosphere.

Serene! Very good place to visit,Shiva temple! Serene place. Very well maintained. Good place to visit during any time. Can spend good one hour. Very good surroundings. One can also visit Balaji temple nearby. Good shops around for any quick street shopping.
Beautiful temple of Lord Shiva,It was our first stop on our Goa tourist outing and  our driver took us to Mangeshi temple which is a very beautiful temple of Lord Shiva. A must go temple in South Goa.
Shiv Mandir in South Goa,It's a religious place dedicated to Mahadev. Very peaceful atmosphere and clean surroundings. It is located in South Goa near Fonda. Beautiful lake is also nearby. Ladies are allowed in the Mandir only if knees are covered. Sufficient parking space is available. Shops selling local items and restaurants are also there. Must visit while in Goa.
Beauty at its best,Holy place. Very peaceful. Feel like you have visited Goa if you have visited this temple. Quite place with peaceful enchanting.
Visit to Mangeshi Temple,"Temple is situated in south Goa , Near to Ponda , it has spice garden nearby and Shantadurga Temple on the other side . The temple belongs to Lord Shiva , It's a peaceful area , full of serenity and Devine presence.At the entrance there is giant pillar which can enlighten many lamps at a time. Inside the temple , there is Shiva lingam inside multiple entrances where only Temple priest has an access to Lord Shiva."
Rich,The temple is commercialised and many outlets are functioning outside. The puja and other rituals are performed in traditional way. Many tourists visit the temple as attraction whereas GSB community visit as their deity.
Serene...,This is a must visit if you are a temple lover.It is Shiva temple with such a serene atmosphere . it is quite clean and very well manitained.
Spiritual place!!,Its a big temple of lord Shiva. Its kinda different experience in goa where we usually visit churches only. Modest dress is required. You cant enter the temple with short clothes.
One of the cleanest temples in the country,This temple is very well maintained (along with Shanta Durga temple nearby). The temple also has facilities for conducting thread ceremonies. The persons manning the temple are also very helpful and not all arrogant as seen in other temples in India. Probably this may be due to the less number of visitors when we were there
Very spiritual,"This place is very spiritual. You can feel it with all your senses. After that, down there is a very good suk. Check there a coconut out."
Temple run,"Visisted this temple as recommended by a tourist advisor.This place is crowded with people from all over the world. The scriptures are normal. Women and men should b covred from head to toe, other wise they will not be allowed to enter the temple.Recommended?Only for temple lovers. 😍"
Lord Mahadeva,A gorgeous temple of Lord Shiva. A very old but now renovated is a well known Shiva temple amongst devotees and tourist. Mangeshi Mahadev has golden mukha with adorable human face. It’s a big temple with all the facilities to stay and a canteen to eat. Puja is being done on behalf of the devotees. Worth visiting.
Spectacular architecture.,The walk up a flight of stairs is worth it when you see these beautiful buildings.  The colours are spectacular.  Entry requires removing shoes.
Divine Experience,"We visited Goa from few days ago. Visit to Goa with out Mangeshi temple visit is not worth visiting GoaTemple is nice, clean & decorated. One get piece of mind once to enter the temple. Got the blessing from almighty Mahadev God. Also seen huge Rath, every year procession in Jan end or Feb start.Happy to know that food is available at canteen. Food was very good.Wonderful visit to Mangeshi temple"
A very good religious place,This temple is about 10 KM's from Basilica of BOM Jesus. It is a very old temple but very clean and pleasant precincts. Deity is lord Mangesh. Open from 5.30am to 10.00 pm. Visited by many people through out the day. A must visit for all tourists.

A holy visit ,"It’s said to have been the birth place of Smt. Lata Mangeshkar .Walk through a long street to the temple with stalls selling commodities like purses, bags, keychains, wallets ,etc. on both the sides."
divine moment,the temple is dedicated to lord shiva . located 21 kms of panjim .the surroundings are calm and serene . well maintained and clean place .may have to walk around 1 km to reach temple from car parking  through a narrow lane of shops .
Beautiful Temple ,So nice Temple building and it’s spotless colours and beautiful design and very clean surrounding is unique here . Dazzling diety of Lord Shiva is so different and attractive that I felt enormous peace and happiness looking and offering my prayers . A must place to visit in Goa if you like visiting temples .
Place of piety,Ahead of old goa in the village priol is the most beautiful and religiously important temple of goa dedicated to lord shiva. It has a huge gate for one to walk into the courtyard. The ground is covered in a shade of coconut leaves which lead to the entrance. Inside is a gold idol of lord mangesh and a gold mulgi headed snake. The atmosphere is pious and serene.
Beautiful,"Clean, Beautiful, Well - maintained. The Temple is historic and wonderful. A visit to Goa, without visiting Ponda and all the old temples here would be incomplete. The peace and spiritual atmosphere inside  makes one feel like sitting here for hours on end."
A peaceful pleasant experience ,"We have been to this temple, located on the lovely Panjim- Bengaluru road , earlier too. And the experience once again has been calming and lovely. If you have a car you have to park it at a distance from the temple and do the half km odd trek via lot of souvenir shops . You can purchase flowers from old ladies to offer to the gods.The temple itself is at elevation. The entrance to the temple, as in most cases in India,is free. However,you should dress appropriately. We saw ladies in shorts being asked to cover their their legs with sheets provided by the temple authorities. You need to take take off your footwear and there is a tap for washing your hands and feet.Photography inside is not allowed. The temple is painted in pleasant white and blue. Inside the temple it is very quiet and peaceful. If you want you can offer money in boxes provided ( although an attendant will encourage you to put it in an open plate). If you have the time sit inside and meditate for some time. The inner sanctum ( to which the entry seem to be restricted) is covered in intricate silver work. There is a very clean and reasonably priced canteen at the rear of the temple where you can sample the local non- nonsense fare.There is ample place on the premises to sit quietly.The temple has this unhurried ambience about it and  is unlike other Hindu temples where priests pester you. There is also a clean use and pay toilet adjacent to the temple. Overall a very rewarding experience."
Peace of mind,Temple of lord Shiva. This temple is very peaceful. One can actually experience there while chanting prayers. It is few kilometres from Goa but yes worth a visit.
One of the largest temples in Goa,"The temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. The complex also has shrines of Goddess Parvati and God Ganesha. The other deities in the temple are Nandikeshvar, Gajana, Bhagavati and the Gramapurusha Deva Sharma of the Kaudanya gotra."
Peaceful,"Mangeshi temple is a little away from the usual tourist destinations. But this is around 20min drive from the Old Goa where the main churches are located and hence worth a visit, if you have time.We were asked to park a little away from temple( around 5min walk), though vehicles can go till the temple and few cars were parked there too. The road leading to temple has shops on both sides.About the temple: Very nice, peaceful atmosphere and beautiful. Functioning Siva temple. Please dress modestly."
Must visit temple,The temple is located at a very peaceful place in Ponda. It's architecture is very nice. This temple has been built by Lata Mangeshwar and family.It is devoted to Lord Shiva.A must visit temple.
unusual temple,"Right as one gets down and starts walking towards the temple, its a different feeling.On one side there are commercial shops and vendors, on the other a narrow path way which is quiet... as we climb the steps and move, we can wash our feet and then move to the outer yard and then get into the temple. What vibrations as we enter..was crowded as it was the festival time. May be at othe times you do not need to walk as much, can drive closer to the temple."
Visually Beautiful,"What a visually stunning place this temple is. The walk up to the temple is lined with traders huts and lined with paddy fields. The smells, sights and noises on the walk up are a prelude to a very special place of worship and serenity."
Small & Peaceful,"A Shiva temple though centuries old did not have a feel of a very commercialised temple.It was more like a temple of extended 24 families that initially took care of the temple.It was peaceful and clean.Facilities like water tap to wash hands after removing footwear, drinking water should see some improvement.Vehicles aren't allowed in the lane/road leading to the temple which means it's a walk of around 10 minutes.This is understandable consider space being a constraint at the entry.However please remove board saying road closed due to road work and allow vehicles to drop aged and with special needs.Shopping for small souvenirs is possible in the small street market along the path.Better arrangements for archana would be boon for devotees.Should be there on your list to visit when in Goa."
old temple,It is devoted to Lord Shiv.One has to walk 5 minute from the main road to reach the temple.We went to the temple on an evening and spent some time relaxing. Temple is well maintained and seems to be renovated.  The surroundings is also very clean.Mangeshi Lord is one of the local deity's of Goan Maharashtrians.
Very Good Temple,Very nice structure and a very beautiful temple built from inside also. It is in ponda and far from goa so better fuel your vehicle before going.
Nice Architecture,"Nice temple in Goa having nice architecture, Little shopping place outside temple road.One can spent 30 min to 1 hr in temple"
Chaos !,"the temple is nice.guides are terrible.you will be asked to remove your shoes to enter the temple, but the ground is extremely dirty.monkeys could be seen around the temple.the small market leading to the temple is nice (few shops where you can bargain to get good prices for souvenirs)"

Visit if you want to go to temple & can walk half a KM.,"We went to the temple as it was on way, the temple is really beautiful and there is good place to sit, relax and do your prayers.. Must visit if you love to visit temple..What was inconvenient, was the fact that we have to park our vehicle Half a KM earlier, with my elder parents and a 6 month old baby, it was difficult to walk in hot sunny day.. What was more bad was some vehicles were allowed (Govt. Local etc).."
Clean and serene,A temple made more famous by the Mangeshkar family. Very nicely kept unlike in many parts of India.Serene and calm. Advice for young ladies who include this in their sightseeing itinerary. After the beach. Please cover up decently else you would be not be allowed inside. A big relief is the washrooms outside the temple which are ok I guess by Indian standard

Beautiful temple,"The temple is a beautiful sight to your eyes. It is said that lord shiva appeared here in swayambhu linga form. All gods started coming and worshipping the linga. Once goddess parvati came to have a darshan. Lord shiva played a prank on her by turning into a tiger. Seeing the tiger the goddess shouted"" मां गिरीश पाही रक्षैव मम"" (which is sanskrit for O lord shiva protect me). Since the goddess was fearstrucken she mispronounced"" मां गिरीश "" as""मांगीश"" . Since then lord shiva is known as mangish. The temple is very beautiful and ever crowded.  There are puja shops on the way to temple. Men should wear full pants and women should wear a saree to visit this temple as guards may stop them from entering if found in improper dress but most times they are polite and let you enter.

Ancient GSB Konkani Temple in Goa,"Shree Mangeshi (Mangueshi) Temple in Priol, Goa, is our Kuldevata and we undertake a family pilgrimage to this ancient temple every year.Being from the Vatsa Gotra, (one of the first families to build the relocated temple here in 1565), we have certain privileges like entering the sanctum sanctorum (inner most holy place, where the Deity of Lord Mangueshi is installed) and perform the Pooja rituals ourselves. There is strict dress code and also a need for a Satvik food code to be eligible to enter the sanctum sanctorum. The nearly 2-hour ritual is a most fulfilling experience and that makes many GSB's like us undertake pilgrimages every year. Rooms are available for the Kulavis at nominal prices; there are many homes around this temple complex that provide food to the pilgrims at a very nominal rates."
Beautiful temple set in a big temple complex,The main temple is part of a larger temple complex that consists of smaller temples and living quarters for staff as well as travellers who need accommodation at very nominal charges.The place is very well maintained.The temple's approach is surrounded by shops of locals selling stuff for pooja along side other trinkets.

Must see for religious sorts,The temple is situated near Ponda and just a few kms away from St Francis Church. I visited this from Calanguate on a bike and reached at around 1710.

Shiva Temple,"We visited in Feb 2017 on Mahashivratri, huge temple. We experience huge crowds and long Que to take Darshan of Shiva God Nicely Built and huge premises. The approach road had lots of shops."
Divine Shiva Temple,"It is really great place to visit with family and friends. Basically this is ancestral town of famous singer Lata Mangeshkar. Temple is just besides main road and approx. half hour drive from Panaji. Public transport is very less frequent, so better rent a bike in Panji. Temple is so beautiful that you can feel Divine blessing of Lord Shiva. My suggestion is you should visit Mahalasa temple just 1km from Mangeshi, which is lesser known basically. Mahalasa temple is one of the most calm and holy temple I have ever visited."

Holy Hindu Temple that survived the inquisition,"My taxi driver mentioned that this temple was located in the same village, the great singer, Lata Mangeskar, hailed from.   The temple architecture is unique with white dominating and a tower within the complex.   The idol survived the Portuguese Inquisition for 500 years, when many other Hindu religious landmarks were completely destroyed.  This aspect gives the temple more importance.  I had a wonderful visit and it a bit of a walk from the car park.  Along the walk there are many shops and restaurants and it presents a carnival atmosphere with families visiting.   A peaceful, serene comes upon one on visiting the temple and one needs to reflect on the spiritual energy this temple emanates to you."
Been There Done That,"I visited the temple on a taxi guided tour. It is important to experience, or at least see, some of the religious life of Goa. It was interesting but not particularly peaceful or inspiring. Visit if you haven't visited a Hindu temple before, but you can skip it if you have been to one before........assuming you are not Hindu. Then you will surely want to visit."
Very Serene & Peaceful,"Very Serene & Peaceful place,very old Lord Shiva Temple.Near from Ponda city.Clean & beautiful.Has scenic surroundings and a pond outside."

Sameeksha By Sachin - Beautiful Temple of Lord Shiva,"The temple is white in colour. The main deity of temple is Lord Shiva. There is a deep stambha (Lamp Tower) with in the temple complex.  One has to walk 5 minute from the main road to reach the temple. There is a small market there near the temple. One has to come back from the same road which is used while going. When I came out from the temple, I unconsciously walked down the adjacent road and then I suddenly realized that I am on the wrong road and then crossed the divider and reached the right one. It is one of best tourist attraction of Goa with mythological importance. I would highly recommend this place for the tourist to visit."
Nice temple,Nice religious place with peaceful environment. Wear decent clothes while going to it. Must visit for religious people.
Nice place to visit,This is old historical temple and wort place to visit if you are religious minded.Lata Mangeshkar belongs to this village
Looks as if painted yesterday though built in 1561,"It is mentioned on the plaque at the entrance of the temple that the original idol has been relocated to present site of Ponda in Goa from another location where there was heavy threat of ritual restrictions during Portuguese rule & atrocities introduced at the time of Inquisition.  From Karmali railway station which is the nearest railway stop to go to Panjim city this place is about 30 minutes by car.  On the main road there is distinct marking to indicate the temple site.  One has to get down at the car park & walk a narrow street dotted with souvenir shops, fruit & drink stalls as well as prayer material vendors before taking a flight of stairs to enter the temple complex which is quite spacious.  There is a water tank adjacent & view from the top is pleasant with surrounding coconut trees in the background.  A white painted lamp tower with golden arc borders is present besides the rose flower garden. In the main temple hall, photography is restricted & the actual idol is behind several doors so hardly anything can be seen.  After the visit when you are going further to other temples nearby or while returning you will notice that local produce including fruits & vegetables are sold on the roadside make shift stalls."
So lovely,"I think I really like temples :DEach temple I went was sth joyful for me.This was a great one too.We bought flowers.walking with no footwear, eat and drink the pastry and water and done what locals were doing :D Dress properly Worth a visit"
Beautiful Architecture ,"This temple is one of the oldest shiva temples in goa and based on the folklore of Mangesh is followed by another two temples of Mahalsa and Shantadurga.  The temple is approx 40 km from baga and the approx 20km from panjim. Though it's accessible by buses through panjim, I would suggest to do all the three temples by renting a car or self drive or riding on scooters.  Won't bank on the buses.  There is a good walk to the temple from the parking point too.  The temple has beautiful Architecture and is quite surreal too. Must visit while in goa."
An old temple in South Goa,While taking a tour of South Goa this is one of the place where you will have to visit. This belongs to Lord Shiva and is said to be where lata Mangeshkar belongs. The temple is well laid out. I wish they had made good arrangements for carpet to walk on the hot stone in summer.
"Ladies, please wear nice formal dress","Ladies with unusual dresses exposing the body too much is not allowed. You can buy a formal dhoti kind of a thing to cover, for rent.

Excellent vibes,"The mangeshi temple is a must-visit, for it stands as a testimony to the goan architecture. I was told that the great singer Lata Mangeshkar hails from this village.

Mangeshi Temple .....dedicated to Lord Shiva !,"We visited this temple in last week of April 2016 after a darshan in Shantadurga Devi Temple , also located in Ponda . We climbed the steps to reach the temple and first thing we saw was the Deepstambha....the light tower . This is seven story high and can accommodate a large number of oil lamps which are lit on special religious festivals. The main temple has the Shivalinga , a representation of Lord Shiva . We learnt that the temple has a long history starting from the year 1560 A.D.. The temple has been renovated on three occasions between mid eighteen to late nineteen centuries. There are number of structures near the temple to accommodate the visiting devotees .The environment around the temple is charming and is hilly. The campus is well maintained. Overall , it creates a very pious ambiance. Our return  travel of 22Kms. back to Panaji was full of sweet memories."
One of the best temples in Goa,"The temple is nicely surrounded by hills. The drive to the temple is also very nice, with beautiful roads covered in thick forest on both sides. Ofcourse, I visited in the rainy season, so not sure how the roads will be in summer. If you have senior citizens or people who cannot walk upto the temple, the guards will allow your car to pass and take it right till the temple steps. The area inside the temple is pleasing and really big. At the centre is the main Mangeshi Temple, which is dedicated Lord Shiva."

High energy,"Mangeshi temple exudes energy, despite the onslaught of noisy tourists . Its can get crowded especially if a tour bus has just reached there, to unload the ""pligrims"" who can be a nuisance to the real worshippers.

Beautiful temple !!,"Its a beautiful temple built by Lata Mangeshkar in her  native village. There are many shops selling sweets, offerings, cashews and food stuff outside the temple. Along with Shantadurga temple, it is on every tourists list while on a trip to Goa."
Beautiful temple,"It is a beautiful temple located in ""Lata Mangeshkar's Village"". They don't allow short dress, so they have kept raparounds on rent. They have a canteen which offers good and fresh food and very cheap also. so its better to have your food in the canteen rather than stalls outside the temple. There is a small market offering good local things like kokam, kaju and other kaju sweets."
very nice place to get relax. & find real peace,This temple is very beautiful. It is in the south goa. It is religious temple. U can get good food at very less price at that place .
awesum temple ... very well maintained,"Just a relaxing place to visit spread over a good area Felt at peace ... when we visited the deity Has a history which it can boast of , built in very unique style the deep stambhs in all goan temples are very uniqiue in nature"
Long walk past a lot of pushy salesmen to reach it,"It is wrong to visit an area without trying to see the sights.  It cost is 4800 rupees to hire a local taxi for a day trip covering the main sights of south Goa. This was our 3rd stop.After paying 20 rupees for the driver to park in the car park, we walked down a long road to the temple [no vehicles allowed]. This is probably because either there is nowhere to park at the temple end of the road or more likely to ensure that you run the gauntlet of the multitude of souvenir shops along the way. It really is amazing that the shop keepers have not realised that trying to shoo customers into their shops results in lost sales: No Englishman likes a hard sell and being accosted just for glancing in the direction of a shop for the briefest of micro-glimpses guarantees that we will walk on by and not dare look properly at the merchandise. The lack of a fixed price ticket and the ‘I give you best deal’ is similarly off-putting.Any way after a long walk past shops and more dehydrated women we finally reached the temple. Again impressive and lots of statues worth a look."
Interesting but not worth the detour,"while visiting old goa you may consider adding Mangeshi temple on to your list off sites to visit, i believe it was less then 30 minutes away by car.depending on your religion the visit to the temple will be short or longer :) for me it was quite short :) seen temples i consider more interesting in India"
Nice Shiv Ji Temple,"this is a very good and well designed temple we went where while coming back from dudhsagar fallsnot many tourist visit here.but worth watching, avoid on afternoon"
One thing to watch apart of Churches,"this is very beautiful temple, set up in outer city area. we drove and used the GPS and it was very easy for us, else you will have to ask the locals. they are helpful"
En-route visit to holy Shiva temple,"Divine feeling, calm and peaceful experience since we reached in the late afternoon. A beautiful chariot outside temple added to good view."
Magnificent !,One of the most beautiful temple in old Goa !Serenity and beauty are welcoming you in a stunning marble edifice .Most recommended !
Lord Shiva Temple,This is a beautiful temple dedicated to lord Shiva. Very nice ambiance which brings spiritual feelings within you. Regular religious rituals are conducted here.Annual fair is conducted in the month of February.Staying facilities are available.Nice temple to visit.
worth a visit,"If you love to be at temples you can be here. Goa temples have a different architecture, It has been influenced by its history. Its clean and neat."
Lord Shiva Temple,"This temple is  over four centuries old and is highly regarded by the local Hindus. Lord Manguesh is an incarnation of Lord Shiva - the omnipresent God - from north to south and from east to west in India. The temple campus is much sprawling with Agrashalas - a pilgrims resting place, canteens, etc. the temple trust does some remarkable charitable works like running schools etc. Tourist/pilgrims who travel by bus has to walk a little from main road/ bus stop to reach the temple  while those riding a car/taxi can go right upto the entrance of the main temple. A visitor may avail canteen facilities there inside the temple premises in the Agrashala. Out side the temple is line with shops     dealing in local fruits to beach clothes etc."
cam and quite,i visited this temple on morning time. at that time temple and surroundings and totally cam and quite. some poojas were going. no rush with visitors. we should keep the religious value in this temple.
Very attractive holy place in Goa.,Location of this temple is very nice. This is surrounded by green hills. Very clean and peaceful. There is restaurant with delicious food and many varieties of breakfast in very nominal rate.
Nice place pf worship,"Very well maintained temple in South Goa, Ponda region around 8 KMs north of Shanta Durga temple. There are shops lined on the way to the temple and you have to walk about 600 Ms from the car stand to reach this place."
Devine!,"This is by far one of the best temples in the India and the very best of Goa. It is of historic importance to not only the GSB community who patonize lord Mangesh as the presiding deity of thier Kul, but also to Goas culture and tourism. When in Goa, one should definitely seek the lords blessings. Om Namah Shivay!"
Unique Goan temple architecture,"It is definitely worth visiting a few of the temples in the Ponda area. Even if you aren't interested in taking darshan of the deity, the typical architectural style of these Goan temples is something special to see."
Very beautiful and serene,We booked south goa tour by tour operators. This temple is one of the finest attractions. The temple is quite serene and nicely maintained. But astonished to see empty alcohol bottled littered by the side of the path way at the entry from main road. Temple administration should have taken measures to avoid this.
"Kind of cool, but cannot rival comparable temples in Thailand","It was good to see this place, but I was lucky enough to see places like this in Thailand earlier this year, and this place just does not compare.  It was not as architecturally impressive, and the historical information provided was scant.  But it was cool to see."
Very Beautiful and peaceful Temple,The temple is a very beautiful and nice one. it is very clean and serene. the surrounding are also very nice and beautiful. A nice place to visit.
Shiva Temple,This is the main temple for many families. It is in active us and visited by many devotees and not just tourist. It is a holy place of worship.
Nice temple !,"Mangeshi temple in Ponda is a nicely designed and serene temple. The Architecture is good and the deity is adorned beautifully. The prayers are done in a very divine manner and one can definitely find peace here. It can be very hot when one goes in the afternoon during sunny days.Vehicles are not allowed till the entrance of the temple but its around 150 to 200 metres walk from parking and the path is lined with shops. Its a 30 mins drive from Panaji and if one is travellin from South to North Goa, the route can be planned via Ponda to visit this temple."
Peaceful and Serene,This is my favourite temple in India and nowhere else have i found more peace. The surroundings are very clean and green. Facilities are very good. We always visit this first on our yearly Goa trip.
Visiting after a decade,Excellent place to have a good Darshan. Busy and crowded. Infrastructure is requiring improvement. Too much construction is not helping the beauty of the location.  The walk to the temple from the small shops was full of crowd.
Temple for Lord Shiva,Extremely clean temple. There is a tower which is lit with 400 lamps every Monday. So try and visit the temple on a Monday. Small shops nearby sale various mementos.
Calm ...,Mangeshi temple is Lord Shiva's Temple. Around 15 KM far from panjim. Ladies and Girls in Short dresses are not allowed and many other warning are clearly written on the wall of the temple. So we recommend to read them before entering into the temple.
A great location & a serene Temple!,While on our way back to Bangalore we visited the temple in the morning. It was a good drive and the temple is strategically located at a high point. There was ample parking outside so we parked and walked to the temple. There are lovely shops around for you to pick pick flowers for pooja or also shop around for unique things for collection. The temple was pleasant and serene and there was a medium crowd. We got the darshan in few minutes as the queue was not long. The place has a lovely view around.Outside the temple there are shops serving fresh cut fruits which is awesome and has a good variety. Overall a good place to visit during your stay in Goa.Time at the Temple - 20-30 minutes ( Incase you choose to do a special pooja it will take addl time)
Very beautiful and calm temple,Its very clean and beautiful temple. Its very crowded place. However you can feel peace in temple. Temple is well maintained.
Beautiful. ,We were dropped in the car park its about a 10 minute walk through the market stores.The temple is really  beautiful and clean plenty of people going in to pray.
Family deity of Indian Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar !!!,"The Mangeshi temple is the family deity or Kul daivat of the great Indian Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and her family. The temple of Shri Mangesh is set amidst natural beauty and pleasant surroundings.Mangeshi, a little village along Goa’s Panaji-Ponda road is not only a point of pilgrimage for the followers of the Lord, it attracts hundreds of tourists from all over India and abroad. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in Salcette which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in Salcete district, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Aghanashini to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja district, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure.Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and yet another time in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha holy vessel was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The Peshwas donated the village of Mangeshi to the temple in 1739 on the suggestion of their Sardar, Shri Ramchandra Malhar Sukhtankar, who was a staunch follower of Shri Mangesh. Ironically, just a few years after it was built, this area too fell into Portuguese hands in 1763, but by now, the Portuguese had lost their initial religious zeal and had become quite tolerant of other religions, and so, this structure remained untouched.The main temple is dedicated to Lord Mangesh, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga. According to the legend, Lord Shiva had manifested into a tiger to scare his wife Parvati. Paravati, who was frightened at the sight of the tiger, went in search of Lord Shiva and cried out, ""Trahi Mam girisha!"" (Oh Lord of Mountains, save me!). Upon hearing the words, Lord Shiva turned himself back to his normal form. The words ""mam girisha"" became associated with Lord Shiva and over time the words got abbreviated to Manguirisha or Mangesh.He is the kuldevta or family deity of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins in Hindu community.Overall must visit destination in Goa for its sheer history !"
"Well maintained temple, very beautiful part of South Goa, must go ","The temple is well maintained and is beautiful. The access roads are a bit narrow and don't always allow vehicles in. The other pedestrian only path is better to walk. Local a/c taxi to Britona or Nerul is around INR 1000 during peak season on 24th December 2015. Attended a wedding, awesome food."
temple visit,Very nice temple and good place to visit. kept neat and clean which I like when visiting temple.  Nice sugarcane juice was available outside with good taste.  To reach this template you need walk approx 1 km from parking while Car are reaching till gate with discrimination and choice of guard without clear guidelines at gate. As per board (tried to erase)  taxis not allowed but taxis going and personal vehicles with mercy of guard allowed.
Unique architecture for a Hindu temple,"This temple is located quite far off, even further than Old Goa, but is definitely worth a visit. Good to do this temple when visiting Old Goa. As usual, the car park is far away, so visitors are to get off their vehicles at the car park and walk a certain distance. Bring your shades and hat, please! It was really hot when we were there. Plenty of sellers along the walking path, and while mentioning walking path, I should caution you about the vehicles. Why there are motorbikes and even cars zooming past in a ""walking path"" perplexes me, but this is India.The temple is has a unique architecture, with a tower looking like a pagoda. It's very clean in the temple compound. The entire visit will take you about an hour. Do take some time looking at the vendor's goods along the way. We found certain unique items and souvenirs which weren't available elsewhere in Goa. I won't mention it - see it for yourselves!"
The Lord resides here.....in all his power,"The temple is nestled in the midst of hills and thick group of Coconut trees......ahead of a serene water reservoir(tala in marathi and tale in konkani).......The salubrious surroundings of the temple beckons the pilgrims for worship and stay.The temple bus stop is  located on the Panaji Margao main road and one has to walk for about 10 minutes on the cemented pathway to reach the door-step of the temple and ascend the steps enabling one to  reach the temple precincts and one finds oneself in front of the temple structure......a few steps up and one has the darshan of the Lord........who is the form of Lord Shiva (jatadhari).........The sanctum where the Lord resides has the form of a deity horizontally embedded on the floor and the morning prayers are solemnised by bathing the statue in water honey and curd.Handis full of water are poured over the small diety,drawn from the nearby well next to the Sactum santorum.In the after noon the lord dons a dress and is decorated with fragrant flowers invoking obeisance and forgiveness before the Almighty......Behind the temple resides the Mulkeshwar (shepherd) who also acts like a Gram -rakshak.whose tall statue adorns the beautifully restored temple...In the left chamber reside Santeri and Veer bhadra and in the right hall are the Laxminarayan Surya narayan and Garuda (eagle)........Legend has it that thousands of years ago in a village the village were surprised to find a cow's udders spraying an idol by the way-side with milk.......villagers surmised this as the......visit of the lord himself and placed it on a pedestal and summoned brahmins who took care of the it Chanting shlokas and mantras the Lord was bestowed upon the honour he deserved......during the portuguese rule when temples were desecrated,the temple idols were brought here to this places which was a diffcult place to reach in those days when this place was almost a thick jungle...........God was thus assigned a safer "" haven"".The families who are assigned to the God are known as mahajans and can stay in the temple premises where rooms are built in the area surrounding it.They belong to the Gauda Saraswat Brahmin  community..........most of whom stay in Maharashtra and elsewhere.I too belong to this community and feel greatly rejuvenated in the company of the Lord and Mulkeshwar that I always make an attempt to visit the temple twice a year and sek the Lord""s blessings.As we come from our journey fom bombay we have to seek dhool -bhet(one meets the lord in the same clothes as are laden with the dust of the journey) and place flowers in the large plate meant for offerings to the god....Aarti (invocation to god )is performed at 12 noon and then at10 in night. and a banana at the Mulkeshwar temple...........One normally performs abhishekha (the ritual of mantras invoking gods blessings.......On each Monday night the Lord""s palanquin is decorated with fowers of different colours and hues and with the lord ""s small idol in itthe palanquin goes around the temple carried by the mahajans in steps .The procession is led by the Secretary of the Temple Trust who is known as the Khamavisdaar.flanked on each -side by the pall-bearers.....A singer walks ahead and sings a few musical invocations to god n completion of each leg.........witnessing this  fascinating spectacle ones mind is filled with gay abandon .The ceremony is unique and one feels elated after its completion.....A canteen on the premise provides  whole some and nutriitious food and a visit to places like Mhalsa is enchanting.A way ward goan life has picked up one finds oneself in the throes of a quiet life/."

Jai Bole Nath 🙏🏼,"Mangeshi temple is a very important temple, which is part of the Goan heritage & culture. The deity is Shivji Bhagvan. The place of the main deity reminds us immediately of Kashi.

Truly Surreal,"Every time I go to Goa, I make it a point to visit this temple and every time I visit here, I find it amazing how new it feels. Apart from occasional bells being run by the visiting devotees, this place ends up being a vortex of soul searching; at least for me."
Quite and Serene Place,"This temple is one of the most famous temples in Goa. It has a huge campus. Once you enter the temple, you could feel the inner peace inspite of the rush of people. You can find a place for yourself and meditate."
"Mangueshi Temple, Goa, an escape from beaches","If you love to deviate from beaches in Goa for a change, do reach at Mangueshi temple.

The architectural style of the building is in tune with the Christian style. The place is calm and neat."

Har Har Mahadev ….. great feeling to be here!,"This is a serene lord shiva temple in Goa. It is on the highway and is beautifully done. The temple and its premises are very spacious. The place though crowded, still offers peace to its visitors. The temple has an adjoining pond and there are rooms to stay as well. Further, it has a stambh (pillar), which when illuminated with diyas looks very beautiful. This temple is one of the must when you visit Goa."
Good Temple to Visit,"Well managed, faster darshan, clean temple and lots of parking and also within 15km from Panjim.If you have a day to visit, and looking for attraction/places of interest in North Goa, would suggest you do the following in 1 day1.

"Not so worth, Good for the religious people",This temple is around 45km from panjim.I found its average place as I belong to the place where any one can find lots of temple better than this.Its simple temple. Nothing is special here. shopping area is outside the temple.

Best temple with scenic beauty,Mangeshi temple is best place in Goa. All the tourist needs to visit this temple as it is the known temple for Lord Mangesh who is one of Lord Shiva's avtaar. The temple has best scenic views and is very much strict with regard to clothings. Women cannot enter temple if wearing short skirt or short clothes. You just enter the temple and feel completely blessed by Lord Mangesh. Do visit this auspicious place when in Goa.
Nothing much to see except temple,On the way to Dhudhsagar so if you are visiting Dhudhsagar then can include otherwise skip this place

good temple,Nice temple to visit.We enjoyed this place very much nice place to buy hat and other items.temple surrounding is very good
Temple or business place??,Temple was very good. Only thing which I don't like was if you pay high amount as donation then you can pray close to the god otherwise stay outside where all the general people stays. Its like they are sitting there to earn money.

Best temple in Goa,"It is one of the best temples in Goa - better than Shantadurga temple, in terms of architecture and magnificence. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is very peaceful and tranquil - we spent some time there, to rest and soak in the divine peace. Has got decent food and drinking water facilities near the temple with very well maintained temple walls, painted very recently. Has got a big tower, with gothic architecture in traditional Portuguese style, which is the hallmark of Goa. Very unique in its build - never seen a temple, that so closely resembbles a church! Its orthogonal in shape and possibly one of the only temple in India, which has a tall minar / watch tower within its premises."

A Relic of Goa's Pre Colonial Heritage,"I wished to visit this temple as it is a fine example of the typical Goan Hindu style of architecture. It is a beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Considered to be the most important temple in Goa, it is located on a hillock at Proil which is in the Ponda Taluka of Goa,about 21 km from the capital Panjim. It is one of the largest, wealthiest and most frequently visited temples in Goa.The temple was originally built in a village named Kushasthali which is now known as Cortalim, in Salcette. When Salcette was invaded by the Portuguese, the idol was removed to a safer place and later consecrated in the present location in 1560. It was a simple structure then. The present form of the temple is attributed to the rule of the Peshwas (Prime Ministers of the Maratha Empire) in the 18th century.Apart from the main deity, the beautiful white deepastambha (lamp tower), a prominent nandi bull statue and the temple tank, believed to be the oldest part of the temple are highlights of the temple complex.The complex also has shrines of Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesha and many other deities. The beautiful white temple is a treat for the eyes and the spiritually inclined. The premises are very clean and well maintained.The parking space is situated about 800 meters from the main temple. The road from here to the temple is flanked by a number of souvenir shops which I feel is not in tune with the atmosphere of the place. Trudging upto the temple especially in a hot day is not really a pleasant experience. This area could have been used for a parking space. Commercial considerations have been given precedence over comfort of visitors.Photography is not allowed at the interiors of the temple."
Awesome temple,Visited this temple in October 2014. We saw a huge queue so couldn't go inside the temple. But from the outside it was just awesome. Neatly maintained temple.
Good rooms in the Mutt,The rooms in the Mutt are really good. Only catch is that Lord Mangesh should be your family god. Rooms are a short walk away from the temple with good parking space.
Beautiful temple,"We visited mangeshi temple in morning. The temple is very beautiful and clean. The idol is very unique, feel very calm once you are inside the temple."
