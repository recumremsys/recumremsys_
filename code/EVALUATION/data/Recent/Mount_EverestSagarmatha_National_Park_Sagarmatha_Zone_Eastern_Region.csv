Everest Conquest,The trekking in Mt Everest is one of the best experience ever in our life. Really impressive and memorable with the challenges.
Tracking,Mount Everest base camp in Nepal one of the most popular place for tourist many people Can you going to travel with tracking guides.
Fantastic Setting in Remote Area,"I had two Everest experiences. The first was a scenic flight from Kathmandu which was breathtaking. We flew up and down the Himalayan Range. Everyone had a window seat and we took turns stepping into the pilot's cabin for pictures. The second was a 14 day small group (6 hikers + guides and helpers) Everest lodge to lodge treks through Himalayan villages (but not to Base Camp). We maxed out at about 13,000 feet. The views of Everest and the surrounding mountains were magnificent. Also, it was fascinating seeing the local village life as we walked through and stayed in places such as Lukla, Phakding, Namche Bazaar, Tengboche (closest to Mt. Everest), Khumjung and Thame. We shared the trails with yaks, zopkio (a cross between a yak and a cow) , donkeys, locals and porters carrying loads of all sizes and shapes as much as 200 pounds. These villages are many days walk from the nearest road. In many ways life was like the way it might have been centuries ago. In all, this was a fantastic experience in so many ways."
Most amazing experience ever,Most breathtaking views and a wonderful trek. Mount Everest is the place to be once in a lifetime. But get prepared for high altitude and you are ready for it.
Wonderful trek to Everest Base camp Trek with Mountain Sherpa Trekking & Expeditions,"We just came from our 11 days Everest base camp trek with Mountain Sherpa Trekking & Expedition. It was really a wonderful trekking experience from day we start our trek from Lukla to end. Our total trip durations was 15 nights 16 days.Nepal had been on my bucket list for years. I am so happy I was able to experience the Everest base camp Trek with Mountain Sherpa trekking & Expeditions. My wife and me did private Custom trek, which was perfect plan.I want to start off by saying our local Sherpa guide Rinji Sherpa was PHENOMENAL! Rinji English was good enough and he was really reliable guide that we always feel 100% safe with him.  He is very experienced about the Khumbu area including all aspects of Sherpa culture and history and told us many stories along the way.Our Poter Kami Sherpa was amazing, carried all our gears, very hard working and always smiling. Mountain Sherpa trekking & Expeditions really differentiates itself by confirming that all of their staff are treated well ranging from the porters and tour guides. MST provides their staff with standardized gear like hiking shoes and the essential clothing for the weather. This may seem common but unfortunately isn't the case with all company - as you will frequently see porters from other companies hiking in flip-flops and all kinds of uncomfortable shoes. The porters are often covered in sweat and work extremely hard so it is very reassuring to know that they are treated appropriately. We had some time to get to see some of the porters and study a little bit about what they were carrying and also have a brief insight into their lives - you really do appreciate them a lot more and realize why its crucial that they should be treated well.Also I appreciated that Mountain Sherpa trekking provided quality lodge accommodations options as per clients budget and requirements. Overall, this was an amazing experience and I would definitely use Mountain Sherpa trekking if I came back. The trek itself was challenging than I thought, yet really worthwhile. Once we reached top of Kala Patthar, we could spectacular 360 views that surrounded us. This trek is very popular trek so it was much busier and crowded than I expected. . I’m glad I had booked our  Lukla flight in advance because it was best to get flight ticket on 1st or 2nd flight schedule which is roughly 80% less chance of cancelations. Tandi, Pasang & Sumba and Rinji if you're reading this, thank you very much again and I hope you continue to keep it up and pass on this note to all the team that helped shape our experience. We truly have so many stories and memories to share from this one and it would not have been the same without you."
"Amazing views, no picture can do it justice","I'd heard that the rubbish was pretty bad, but actually I rarely saw rubbish and there were a lot of bins along the way as well as lots of recycling initiatives...There were of course some spots just off the path where people had chosen to go to the loo...I can't understand why people don't take their tissues with them- take a doggy/ nappy bag to put them in- it's disgusting that so much tissue is strewn across areas- which would take years to decompose- but at least these were off the path."
Amazing mountains range including mt. Everest,My dream bacame true. I was dreaming to be here for long time. I am very thankful to my friends who arrange this trek. I saw mt.everest in front of me from kalapathar it was frezzing cold but the view of this gaint mountains took out every obstacles.I also saw mt.lhotse mt makalu and many other peaks. This mountains looks like alps but in reality they are so big. The khumbu glaciers is too big and beautiful but the sad thing is it is melting quickly.I highly recomend to everybody to go mt.everest base camp once in a life so that you can enjoy the nature and amazing sherpa people hospitality ..
Sagarmatha National Park,Amazing Scenery of the mountains around and the trek is refreshing as you walking up the mountain to Base Camp.
Sagarmatha,"Its a pity the previous correspondents have shown disrespect to this iconic mountain and the many that have lost their lives whilst attempting to conquer it. They cannot have  stood before it so come on TripAdvisor do your thing.Which ever route you take, the hard work is really worth the effort when you look over the mountain tops and see Sagarmatha grace the skies.  We chose to view it from Gokyo Ri, far quieter than EBC.A truly wonderful spectacle and a once in a life time chance.  Don't die wondering!!"
Team Diddlie Bop! Random Hills are not Mountains in Nepal! Quote Sherpa Finjo.,"Mountain Monarch totally catered for our needs in all areas on this trek to Base camp, fantastic Sherpa / guide, the companies philosophy 'one porter one bag' is an endearing and developing way for the future care of the porters, sharing the economics of the company further by way of employment & community spirit. The gear supplied, sleeping bags/liners, jackets, rain protection, food & accommodation provided, itinerary, trek, air port pick up- drop offs, safe trekking policy ensured that we had a fantastic trip. full of surprises, fun and meeting great people. In the event of any issue there was always a back up strategy IE. no planes out of Lukla, lets grab a chopper!!!! Top origination-Pridip, excellent Guide- Finjo and great porters -Ambi and Depee."
Great views but a long walk from the car park,"Long arduous walk from the car park up to the summit- good idea to bring warm clothes and oxygen. Not suitable for children or pets. Amazing view from the summit, but long queues to get there and Items at the gift shop were ridiculously expensive. My wife didn’t like the dead bodies littering the pathway. Worth it though for selfie at the summit and a great talking point at dinner parties."
Wonderful experience hiking to Everest Base Camp with Adventures Within Reach,"A group of 5 of us hiked to Everest Base Camp organized by Adventures Within Reach (AWR).  We were originally going to hike in in 8 days and out in 4 days.  But not all of us were going to make it so we changed it to 10 days in and took the helicopter out.  Our tour company was able to change our itinerary on the fly and we were able to successfully complete the hike.  Flying the helicopter through the Himalayan mountains was itself an experience.  Overall, we couldn't have done it without the help of AWR."
Superb experience,I cant express the feeling of mine.i m very very happy for this trip.I will recommend everyone for this trip
Everest Marathon… 2019,"Very well-organized, from the time you book your slot with EM, to the time you get into Katmandu. Absolutely great service, a BIG thank you to the team. Kits and instructions a day before from your friendly and awesome guide Tendi meet your fellow runners then, It all starts from the domestic airport; destination “The Mountain”. A tiny plane, small flight to Lukla, considered one of the most dangerous airports in the World. Though quite intimidating, its reputation precedes it. But certainly an adventurous flight, with a little runway, a few hundred feet of drop and a hill in front you, while you take off or land! Land in Lukla, from here on, you just climb, climb, climb :)The 1st few days are mild and pleasant, through ad hoc paths and tiny villages and smiling faces, all pleasant and tough at the same time. There are tea-houses on the way for accommodation, or camps.. whatever you choose. It gets pretty chilly in the evenings, make sure you have a good sleeping bag. The toilets, well.. I’d say the concept of hygiene is very relative as you gain altitude. The most extreme being at the Base camp itself, you’ll need a gut, I tell ya! Many of the accommodations have Wi-Fi, spotty at that altitude and expensive. Try and disconnect if possible, It’s always nice to meet a connect with fellow hikers from across the world. Once you get out of the tree-line, it’s a different planet. The wind constantly whistling, I found that quite astonishing. Pretty chilly, but you have to give the mountains all the credit. As you tread through the arid, rocky corridors, your surrounded by snow-clad mountains. Absolutely stunning and spectacular views. The enormity makes you feel insignificant, humbled. An experience that no camera can do justice to. Getting to Base Camp was surreal, I’ve always wanted to come here. Try and get here early, gets pretty crowded later during the day. Hope you have a clear day, makes a ton of difference. Finally, the marathon! The highest in the world and one of the toughest. True to its reputation. There will be many times, where you will ask yourself, why you signed up for this atrocity. Though the organizers did a good job of acclimatizing you, the altitude can still get to you. Not only the altitude, the terrain, the wind, the chill, the inclines and the declines, every single muscle in your body.. absolutely everything, is working against you while you try to run and complete the race. Be cautious and try to avoid sprains, falls and bruises. Be safe! Perhaps one of the toughest and most grueling runs you’ll ever do. Was it worth it, absolutely yes! The sense of accomplishment you derive, after you cross the finish line will only make you ecstatic. What is even more overwhelming, is the support and encouragement you get from fellow hikers. It’s like they feel your pain, they truly understand what your going through. It comes out in the form of heartfelt cheering, thank you guys. Overall, fantastic expedition! Loads of fun, an adventure true to its name… the life lesson you get from this endeavor… the people from different walks of life you meet… the memories you have for life, priceless!"
Jiri to Everst lifechangeing Trek,"Everest base camp might be day consuming and lengthy but this trek offers you the panoramic views of the Himalayas including Mt Everest, Mt Lhotse, Mt. Nuptse, Mt.Amabablam, Mt Pumori, Mt Thamserku, and Explore the side of the mountain with the typical culture of Sharpe's Community. since a long time ago their trading lifestyle"
Adventure but Beautiful Mount Everest,"Mount Everest, recognised in Nepali as Sagarmatha and in Tibetan as Chomolungma, is Earth's very best mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The present day reputable elevation of 8,848 m. recognized through China and Nepal, was hooked up by means of a 1955 Indian survey and consequently tested by a Chinese survey in 1975. In 2005, China remeasured the rock height of the mountain, with a result of 8844.43 m. The global border between Nepal and China runs across its summit point. But current overcrowding has led to a spate of “blue sky” deaths on the mountain. Snaking queues of climbers above 8,000 metres in the oxygen-depleted loss of life sector have been forcing humans to spend dangerously long at altitude. There followed an argument between China and Nepal as to whether or not the reliable peak  be the rock peak the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). Mount Everest has long been a metaphor for intense fulfillment – something that is each tough and hazardous. And, over the years, the bodies of those pro Sherpas who perished in accidents or climbers who succumbed to the cold and altitude have testified to just how unsafe it is to strive to climb to the 8,848-metre summit. In 2010, an settlement was once reached via both aspects that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognizes China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m."
wonderful landscape,"World's Highest Heritage side ""Sagarmatha National Park"" including Namche Bazzar, which is acknowledged as Khumbu's Sherpa Capital. Here, The key of visiting Everest Base Camp situated on the Khumbu Glacier and  also climb Kala Pattar at 5555m which are surprising viewpoints for Mt. Everest (8848m),  Mt. Nuptse (7879m), Mt. Lhotse (8516m), Mt. Pumori (7161m), Mt Ama Dablain  and other snowstorm capped peaks."
Best Guide Kami Nurbu Sherpa,"I went to EBC with a friend in April 2019, and via conversation on these forums got in touch with a local guide from the region named Kami Nurbu. We flew KTM to Lukla where we met our guide and a porter and started the walk, 13 days return to EBC. It was a challenging but extremely rewarding trip, amazing scenery and thankfully we were generally lucky with the weather!I would thoroughly recommend getting in touch with Kami Nurbu Sherpa, he was a wonderful guide who I truly believe made the experience the best it could have been for us. Arranging the best options in terms of tea house accommodation and helping us to really make the most out of our acclimatisation days. He's a kind and enthusiastic guide who was very willing to make sure we were having a great time. We came back via an alternative route which he was obliging to arrange for us and flew back to KTM for a few days rest at the end.A great trip, the route can be busy at times but not to the detriment of enjoying the experience. Loved it, thanks very much Kami!"
World Expeditions Gokyo Circuit Trek,"The treks from Lukla are a must do. Can thoroughly recommend World Expeditions, very ably led by Bikash. The Gokyo trek is less touristy and you do one high pass. Will remember this trip very fondly with many treasured memories."
Top of the World,"Coming here was an unforgettable experience. Literally, I was standing at the base camp to the top of the world. Words can't even begin to describe the feeling, though probably ""accomplishment"" was high on the list. After this trek to EBC, only summiting will probably top this."
Feeling awesome.,"There are not enough words in English to describe the beauty of these mountains , mount Everest is highest mountain in the world and it is a great pleasure to visit here with friends ."
Out of body experience,After tournign93 countries this trip by helicopter to Everest was the highlight of our experiences. Can not believe we were there and Ollowed the footsteps of sir Hillary
Look up,So a lot of people who do the EBC hike don't come to Base camp.It has a reputation of being kinda over-rated and a lot opt to do Kala Patthar alone. If you are unsure whether it's worth it it absolutely is.It's around a 3 hour return and the route is pretty straight forward.I visited December 1st so there was no tents as out of season for climbing Everest. Despite all that I consider it worth it as the views are fantastic. i loved getting so close to the Khumbu glacier. Do it!
NATURE'S WONDER,"We were fortunate enough that weather permitted our flight to take off and what we saw was astonishing. Simrik was the airline and we took off from Kathmandu after a few days ago our attempt was failed due to bad weather. Even the day 25 Feb, earlier we only traveled to aeroplane and was taken back to airport since weather was not permitting the flight to take off. But we were assured that skies will be cleared within few minutes and that actually happened and we flew to the mountain. The Himalayan range was so grand and our captain gave the information of all peaks like gaurishankar etc in the said range. A very satisfying experience, one should not miss when she/ he visits Nepal"
Speechless,A heaven for the mountaineers! The trek to EBC from Lukla takes around  7-8 days including acclimatisation days and is one of it's own kind. I was taken aback by the beauty and thrill of the experience! Simply speechless!
Just Incredible!,"The was the single best thing I've ever done! If you want to challenge yourself, you want a rewarding experience and to meet some fantastic people 100% do it. The guides that Intrepid provided made the trip all the better. They made me feel incredibly comfortable and safe. They were not ""it'll be right"" people, which is obviously really important up there. They were super attentive to everyone's every need. The views are the most stunning I've ever experienced. You should go have a look too!"
Amazing Everest,"After a nine day trek ,finally arrived at Everest Base Camp. It's was such an amazing feeling to be at the bottom of the biggest mountain on earth.  You just can't take it in,it's such a rush,such a great experience. You actually see more of Everest on the trek,(weather permitting) but it's worth the hard work on the trek just to stand at this amazing place,I've never felt so in awe of a place ."
10 day trek EBC,"Unforgettable, it think this word describes everything necessary. We've had such a good time with Tom during our trek here. Now totally clear, why a guide is obligatory. The acclimatization was tough. On day 4 I remember we've had some problems but the team did a motivating job pushing us forward. The place is very remote, we just met two other groups, I expected more. We trained to come here for half a year, it paid of, at least physically, even if the altitude was a strong challenge. I'd come here again and again, as the mountains, the views and the group feeling are unique."
Amazing beauty of Himalaya,"One of my favorite destinations in the world and it can be the most popular destinations for any adventure lovers, highly recommended"
Incredible Everest Base Camp Trek,"As a tour leader I have hiked to Everest Base Camp for innumerable times by taking trekking groups, one of the most popular trekking routes in the Himalayas. Thousands of trekkers hike to the base camp every month. Pack up your gears and get ready for the hike. It's your turn!"
Everest Base Camp Trek,"My husband and I hired a private mountain guide and porter and did the EBC trek. The trek is absolutely fabulous. Every step of the way is beautiful scenery. We were extremely glad to not be in a large group as we like to walk at a faster pace. We often got ahead of all of the groups and could walk more freely, instead of just being part of a large traffic jam going up the mountain. We completed the trek from Kathmandu - back to Kathmandu in 11 days. We still took things slow enough that we did not feel altitude sickness. The tea houses that we stayed in on the way up are beyond expectations. We always had great food (try the Tibetan bread). We chose to stay vegetarian to lower our risk of getting sick but many people ate meat and we did not hear of any issues. Bring toilet paper as you won’t find any in the bathrooms on the mountain (you can buy it on the mountain). Bring baby wipes for a “shower” as it is too cold up top to shower/ the shower facilities are not always great. We showered in Namche Bazar quite comfortably.We highly recommend trekking poles. Make sure that you are arriving in decent shape. We saw many people early on in the trek struggling greatly - unlikely to do well once the air is thinner.Bundle up! It gets cold in the evenings and mornings. Your room will not have heating so we often slept in our clothes. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING WATER PURIFICATION PILLS. We saw many people buying bottled water. 1st: it is not cheap2nd: all of that plastic is terrible for our planetThe pills work great, you can’t taste them, they are easy to buy in Kathmandu, they are cheap. You can easily fill your reusable water bottles in the tea houses and then put a pill in the water. We never got sick once.We highly recommend Kala Patthar. We met a lot of people who skipped it. It was the most beautiful part of the trek. It is a challenge as the air is thin but it is absolutely worth it. By FAR the best part of the trek.Enjoy your trek!  Don’t forget to look up every once in a while to enjoy the views! It’s easy to get caught looking down at the trail to prevent yourself from tripping and miss the views! It is a wonderful experience. We really enjoyed ourselves. The Himalayas are absolutely majestic."
Saran Day amazing tour guide,"If you’re looking for an amazing tour guide, look no further than Saran Day. He is such a funny guy and there’s never a dull moment with him. His knowledge of the area is outstanding and his network of locals makes him the guy to know! Showman Saran is definitely the guide you want for basecamp and any other trek in the region. Price was also cheap. Call him on +977 980-3795116 or email saranlee24@gmail.com"
add 3 days on regular EBC trek to extend Chopapass and Gokyo lake trek,One of best trek in the world but must prepared well in advance. We should not be negligence when trekking EBC and Cholapass. Altitude can kill. Proper acclimatization is  very much essential.
Do Visit!,I would definitely say that its a must visit place before you die. Once in a lifetime you gotta visit EBC.
Incredible and amazing experience.,"it was an amazing experience to fly over the Everest, beautiful view. Hope, one day I will be back to do the trekking."
"Classic Everest Route, ""Virgin Trail"". It has been discovered newly, an alternative trail to REACH in Everest Region.","Everest Region is on of the best tourism destinations. Weather is very unreliable within this region. Due to bad weather, Lukla flight does not operate smoothly so don't give up your dream to visit there. We have an alternative trail by using surface transport. Here, the trail starts from Phaplu, (Kathmandu to Phaplu is only 9-10 hours Jeep drive). I strongly recommend you to this trail, because 1) Your trip cost become cheaper as the flight ticket is comparatively expansive, 2) you will have more opportunities to explore rural villages, engage with different people and their customs, 3) you don't have to put your life on risk, as the Lukla Airport is one of the most dangerous airports,This route may take three days longer but still your travel cost will be less compare to get flight to Lukla.If you want know more information, ping me here: bimochanrai09@gmail.com"
Everest base camp Trekking,"Mt, Everest base camp trekking is a bit challenging but very joyful trek, Every year many travellers visiting this place, on the way to Everest every places there are clean and comfortable lodges and friendly people. I highly recommend the travellers who like to visit this place, but you most feet for the fiscal."
Mount Everest,MT. Everest or Tibetan called Ri JOMOLHANGMA. Mount Everest is Highest Mountain in World. Wonderful to visit
EBC tips and impression,"EbcAn adventure for life time. The scenario I believe is unbeatable. Some tips : 1) if your flight are delayed 1 day, don't waste time and take a helicopter (200usd per person). Try to book a flight before 9am to have more chances to go to lukla.2) take with you an aluminum bottle, so you can put hot watter at night and take with you into your sleeping bag for the cold nights.3) Buy some water purifier, there is many on the market like Sawyer mini, steripen ultra or pill purifier. Watter can get very expensive on high altitude and if you always buy bottles you are letting a lot of trash on the mountain.4) Get money in Katmandu. In Namche Bazar they have ATM but you can withdraw less money & pay more fee than in Katmandu.I contract a direct sherpa guide which I can really recommend. He spoke good English and he was very friendly and professional (his fb: Ngwanga Thile )"
Worth The Pain,"There are not enough words in the English language to describe how it feels to undertake the trek from Phaplu to EBC, but I'll try: painful, excruciating, freezing, humbling, terrifying, awe inspiring, crushing, arduous, extreme, spiritual, horrendous, amazing, exhilarating, back breaking, once in a lifetime.Being on the 'roof of the world' at 5,364m is simply the best thing I have ever done in my entire. Talk about a bucket list tick. I can a very happy young lady having made a trek that many others fail on."
My best trekking trip,"We did the trek via Gokyo, Cho-la pass and then went to EBC, and every day was worth every breath ( or half breath near the EBC). We flew into Lukla and started trekking from there. We had luck which getting to Lukla but had to take a helicopter on way back despite waiting for two days to get a clear weather.The trek is extremely beautiful and will surely recommend this for every trekker. It tests you mentally more then physically. Be aware of the hygiene factors during the trek and be sure if you need porter/guide while planning your trip."
Helicopter ride to Mount Everest,"My husband and I decided to splurge for a once in a lifetime helicopter ride to Mount Everest.Here’s what you should know:1.  The trip cost US$2,000 each.  But on arriving at the airport, we saw helicopter rides to Mount Everest advertised for US$999 each.  So perhaps best not to pre-book but shop around instead when you get to Kathmandu.2.  The helicopter was built to seat 2 persons in the front and 3 in the back.  Instead, 7 of us were squashed in - 4 in the back and 3 in the front including the pilot.  There weren’t enough headphones to go around so I missed out on the pilot commentary.  Although the scenery was breathtaking, it was a very uncomfortable ride.  Suggest you get confirmation on how many others will be in the helicopter with you.Also weight and balance is important for flying.  You’ll be weighed and then the pilot will tell you where to sit - don’t expect to get a front row seat just because you got to the helicopter before anyone else.3.  Don’t expect to actually land on Mount Everest, or even see the vast bulk of it.  We were taken to Kalapattar which is the closest view you’ll get if you’re not actually climbing the mountain.  ME is behind two other mountains so you can only see the top of it.  And you can’t see ME from Base Camp either.If you really want to see more of ME, try driving there from the Tibetan side.  Yes, I did say DRIVING there.  Check it out.4.  Five to ten minutes is about all the time you’ll get at Kala Pattar.  Not sure if this is because of altitude sickness or whether the pilot needs to get back to Kathmandu to pick up the next lot clients.  Yes, I know I’m being cynical ...5.  Our helicopter pilot took photos of my husband and I with ME in the background.  We learned that helicopter pilots are not photographers.  Suggest you do not rely solely on the pilot to take good shots.I hope my comments help those contemplating a trip to ME."
Everest base camp,Life changing experience. Quite a difficult trek depending on your route. I went via Gokyo and over Cho La pass to base camp.
Yeti Airlines Mountain Flight,"First we planed to have a helicopter flight, but we find it very expensive. One couple among us dedcided to do that breakfast inclusive. When they landed to main camp, they could not stay more than 5 min.s, also they did not feel good at the hotel on the mountain. The reason was they were not used to those hights. People make it in days or weeks. We chose the plane (Yeti Airlines). It was really fun. We were lucky, the sky was clear and we had the chance to see the top of Mount Everest both from the windows and the cockpit ! We had our champagne and  certificates :))"
everest base camp helicopter tour,"The tour was great, so much variety each day. At first I was optimistic about going on an organised tour but I'd recommend it to anyone, our boss took care of everyone and everything. It was great not having to organise or plan anything yourself. The everest base camp helicopter tour was my highlights of the trip and highly recommended. If you are planning to visit Nepal, just contact Breakfree Adventures, a locally owned company who will arrange all your travel needs with a special care like a family."
First experience to EBC and Kala Patthar,"Me and my team of 11 people started our journey on 14 April. We reached the Everest Base Camp on 21 April 2018 and kala Patthar on 22 April 2018. Quite tough, especially the temperature for us, Asians. -15 celcius during climb to Kala Patthar. However, overall, very memorable experience and sure will repeat again, maybe to other routes."
Roof of the world.,"Mount Everest is the roof of the world as every one knows and other hand as you know it is killer mount among of them too.But it is one mountain you should see live one at list once of your life, not on television, not on media not,...try to be there at list Base Camp of Everest.if you have ego to go to  Base Camp of Everest, I would suggestion to every one else, Do not forget to go to Sunrise views from Kalapathar, it is not far from Base Camp. Enjoy the trip."
Was going to Die....,"I did the everest base camp trek last month, On the way back from the camp I lost consciousness suddenly and got severe seizures likely I was quickly evacuated by a Helicopter from Namche to Kathamndu, I was diagnosed with High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) the fatal form of Altitude sickness unfortunately the seizures broke 5 of my vertebrae and dislocated my right arm, I was hospitalized in ICU in Nepal for 10 days had to fly by stretcher back home in which I did an operation and I am now 3 month off work undergoing rehab...BE CAREFUL from altitude sickness this is not just headache and fatigue this can progress to something really fatal, most of trekking companies won't tell you how risky this trip can be, they will never reveal much information about altitude sickness in order not to scare you! my advise READ about altitude sickness, consult your doctor and do your own research, and if you already there & dont feel well STOP ascending rest where you are or even discuss your symptoms with your guide for possibility of descending or even evacuation before it is too late! My mistake was the trek company told us the guide will evacuate you if necessary but he only did when it was too late, Two days before this happened my guide noticed that I have AMS but he didn't take any action to evacuate me if I was evacuated immediately it would have never progressed to this, Read a lot about the risks of AMS and how you can reduce it and if you got it what you should do! Also you have to know that the trip is very challenging very poor hygiene facilities in terms of toilets, accommodation, you will sleep under negative zero conditions because guest houses dont have proper heating facilities, anyway good luck if you decided to go for it, hope this review saves lives!"
Everest Base Camp!,"We had an amazing 14 day trek from Lukla to EBC & return with Mountain Company. It was very challenging physically & mentally, but the journey was worth every step. Altitude sickness can be a real problem, so you need to ascend slowly, guided by a professional company. You can't actually see Everest from EBC, so you need to view from elsewhere, but the scenery all the way from Lukla is truly stunning."
"Elusive, brooding and majestic","You have two options to catch a view of Everest - hike up from Lukla (you don't have to go all the way to Base Camp) or pay a fortune to take a helicopter flight from Kathmandu or Lukla (which is really cheating!).  Everest is quite elusive during the hike up to base camp.  Your first view comes just before the steep uphill climb into Namche Bazar begins .  Past Namche Bazar, from the lookout by the Sagarmatha National Park Museum, then along the trail to Tengboche offers many great views of Everest and it's neighbors Lohtse and Nuptse, particularly during the morning.  You have more great views at Tengboche then Everest disappears.  You don't even see the peak from Base Camp!  Your best views come from atop Kala Pattar - do save some energy and hike up from Gorak Shep for sunrise - you won't be disappointed (just exhausted) as you get great views of the sinister looking black pyramid shaped peak."
Watch SBS “Trouble in Everest”,"I think this recently released doco called “Trouble on Everest” is a must see for anyone trekking in Nepal. A reminder that unless you don a backpack and carry ALL your own stuff then you are assisted by the Sherpa. They risk their lives so that foreigners can climb. Please respect them and the mountains. Ask yourself why you truly want to do it in the first place. If you can, book through a locally owned and operated outfit so as many proceeds go directly to the Sherpas."
"Everest Basecamp Trek, one for the Bucket List","Definitely a must do, theres few things that come close. 12 Days of trekking with magnificent scenery all along the way. You wont see Everest when you get to Basecamp but you know that going in. It's about getting there, 5356m.The Trek is no joke tough, altitude sickness is common and you abandon comfort once you leave Lukla but, again, you know that going. I immensely enjoyed it even tough i caught a chest infection and slight case of altitude sickness despite taking diamox on the way.be warned about diamox as well, the side effects can be harsh. Everyone you'll run into is super friendly and theres always people to hang out with in the lodges and tea houses along the way."
.,"life is journey,from journey you can lear lots think. really everest one great trekking in the  world.."
Nice view - shame about the place . . . .,"Yes - the mountain looks magnificent, but personally feel that it's best viewed from Kala Pattar, the Cho La, or Gokyo Ri. Firstly you can't actually see the summit from Everest Base Camp: from thre you get a good view of the Khumbu ice-fall, and of the anything-up-to-one-thousand occupants of EBC. You could also no doubt get coffee, donuts, etc and there are the facilities of the EBC Cyber Cafe ,. . . .  if that's what you want, then by ll means visit EBC.It means that I'll be free to enjoy Kala Patar in peace, away from teh crowds ! Particularly as I prefer to ascend it in the afternoon when the sun shines directly onto the Southwest Face of Everest, and the details are clear, rather than in the morning when, with the rising sun directly behind the mountain, it's not that easy to enjoy the sublime panorama, nor to take good photos."
Amazing!,"For me this was truly a ‘bucket list’ trip. Rising out of the smog of the Kathmandu Valley, the views that we had of the Himalayan mountain range on the day of our trio were superb. Passengers were seated only in window seats. Those on the left could see the mountains on the wasps out and those on the right on the way back. All passengers had the opportunity to visit the cockpit and take photos from there. Just before landing a glass of bubbly was served and whilst this was not Moët, it was a nice touch,"
Amazing scenery but disappointed,"We were told that everyone had a window seat and would be able to see the great scenery of the Himalayas. Yes, we did see the Himalayas, but not close.Those of us with A seats saw the Himalayas only from a distance.Those with C seats saw it up close. Trying to take a photo while the person across from you is taking up the whole window trying to get the perfect shot was disappointing. They didn’t know we had a poor view. My ‘assumption’ was both sides of the plane would be given an equal opportunity to see the same view, that sadly was not true.Do not sit on the left, A seat side if you’d actually like to see what you paid for."
King of the Himalayan,"Sagaramatha national park is in listed  the site of world heritage in 1979. This national park is kingdom of wild life, Himalayan, Sherpa culture, traditional buddhist religion, climate many more. This is the area which is known as kingdom of the Sherpa people, too who live there and guiding to people to make their dreams very successful. thanks"
Mountains are really huge in Everest,"Getting to Lukla and then planned overnight at Manjo, Namche Bazaar (2 nights), Tengboche, Dinghbochhe (2 nights) , Labuche, Gorakshep, Everest Base camp and Kalapattar - total 13 days is ideal trip Everest and Kalapattar trek. Do not haste, do not run when you are on the Everest trail."
Namche Hike,"I started my trek from Phaplu,Then trekked to Namche( Takes about 5 days to reach Namche). Before many trekkers going to EBC started their trek from Jiri."
Very rewarding,Great climb on the snow and the views are so rewarding! But this is was not easy especially if you have altitude problems and never done long walks before.
Real pleasure,i was there many time and alsowad special to be in Everest Base camp trek. Its one of the spectalur place in my life and can't wait to go back again. you have to bit careful with sleeping place in Goreshp in peak trekking season. Best season is Mid march to end of Jule and Sep- end of November  too.
The Mount Everest also known as Sagarmatha in Nepal.,"The Mount Everest also known as Sagarmatha in Nepal and Chomolongma in China of the height of 8848m (29,029ft) above sea level is the highest peak in the world. Located at the Khumbu Region of Solukhumbu District in Nepal Mount Everest massive includes neighbor peaks Lhotse 8,516 m (27,940 ft), Nuptse 7,855 m (25,771 ft) and Changtse 7,580 m (24,870 ft) and the height of its base camp is 5300m (18000ft). Firstly, conquered by the Sir Edmond Hillary and Late Tenzing Norge Sherpa, this giant peak has climbed by thousands of climbers till the date."
Solo Guided Trek,Solo Guided trek is best option to do it. U*ltimately you are giving job to someone in this poor country. I did my trip with TransHimalaya . They provided me guide from lukla thus saving my money on his flight. Everything was cool. Must visit place and a journey of lifetime. I have written a detailed blog on it don't know if its permitted here or not. Thanks to TransHimalaya
Once in a lifetime experience,"It is challenging but worth every breath, every step.  Love it!Go slow.  slower.  Usually it is the people who go too fast get sick.  Take your time.  Don't get rushed by the guide or sherpa.  They have been there many times.  But for you, this might be your only time.  So enjoy thoroughly.  Enjoy the journey.  Not the final destination.  Best memories of us were on the way, soaking in the breathtaking out-of-this-world view, and just communicate with God.  It really is a very spiritual place."
It was worth it 👍👍👍,I am proud to say that I had reached at the base of Everest . Enjoyed a lot with my siblings. Had so many unforgettable beautiful memories. Just do not plan just start your journey towards your destination if you are planing.  I think nobody will regret going to Everest to climb or for trekking till base camp it will be worth it trust me 👍👍👍.
Because it's Everest!,"The downside is that everyone wants to go, so it can be crowded. But, it's a beautiful area and the Nepali people are wonderful!"
EBC WOW,A visit to Everest Base Camp is likely on everyone's bucket list and now we have completed that one.It is absolutely awe inspiring.In the off season (no climbing) there is nothing there but the magnificent view.It is a WOW moment for sure.Altitude can be an issue so take care.
base camp,Is very Amazing place !! I still cant believed I been there such a  memorable event of my life .I so thankful to our Guide its so easy for us  all we have to do is walk he takes care of everything  he such a good guide. I WILL recommend  him to everybody. I would  like to go there again.
Flight over Everest,Early flight over the mountains to EverestEveryone gets to take as many photos as they wantView from the cockpit amazingChampagne once we have seen Everest is a bonus ... makes it extra special!About 200USD ... worth every cent!
Breathtaking View along Everest Base Camp Trek and Kala Patthar,"I went on an 12 days Everest Base Camp Trek in mid September 2017. I was surprised by how clean the trail was with hardly any litter. The guesthouses along the trek were better than expected mostly. The food was delicious. The people are friendly. Of course, we had stunning view of Mount Everest, and other mountains around it. The view was particularly amazing from Kala Patthar peak. If the weather permits, hiking up this 5,550 meter peak, which is near Everest Base Camp, is definitely worth it. Overall, the trek is not difficult. However, the altitude may hit you. We were fortunately not affected by altitude sickness, with the carefully planned hike and some diamox pill as advised by the guide, Iswor Prasad Lamichhane, whom we hired directly."
Pictures do not do justice,"Spent 12 days trekking on the Everest Base Camp climb with G Adventures.  It is quite a workout!  Unlike my Mt. Kilimanjaro hike, the EBC hike requires going up and down many, many steps.  The scenery is beautiful - pictures just doesn't do it justice.Tip - bring at least USD$400 for hiring services of a horse to carry you up the trail in the event your body shuts down.  Actually bring double that because if you need the service one day, you'll bound to need it for another day.  Large bills accepted.  It may mean the difference between getting to the summit or not!"
Himalaya Range - Nepalese sightseeing flight,"You take off from Kathmandu early in the morning at 6.30 am for an one hour flight. You pay 190 USD and what you pay for, it's what you get ! Considering that the better option - the helicopter flight - is much more expensive (aprox. 1200 USD per person) don't have big expectations !You'll fly near the Himalayan range for aprox. 25 min. Small and dirty airplane windows will make admiring and taking photos quite difficult !It's a small 16 passenger plane, 8 on one side and 8 on the other, operated by Buddha Air. When you book, insist to be on the right side of the plane and to get the places 6B, 7B, 8B or their A opposites. Otherwise, you'll have the engine and the wing in front of your window, obstructing half of the sight !!!The pilots and the flight attendant are very nice and give you by rotation, the opportunity to come for one min. in the cockpit, where you may finally admire a panoramic view through clear windows.If you are fit and have 14 days time to spend, take the trekking to the Everest Camp Base at 5500 m altitude. It's the best way to admire the range.If not, take the helicopter tour which makes several 5 min. stops, including one at Everest Camp Base.I tried to book the helicopter flight but, traveling alone, I should have paid myself the whole 4800 USD price. I just couldn't find associates to that trip, although I pissed off daily those from the agency ! And 4800 USD alone, it was to far to go ..."
My regret but alway missing,I cant summit cause mountain sickness. But i will try to comback one day. I remembered my Sherpa Team. They helped me almost time trek to camp 3. Thank you everest and friends there.
Flightseeing,"One of the most spectacular sights one can behold. The mighty Himalayan range on a clear day with its crowning jewel the Mount Everest. Buddha Air operates the larger aircraft ATR for a 1-hour trip from  Kathmandu, so the flight is very stable. Weather can change quickly so flights get cancelled, but certainly worth taking a chance if you are in Kathmandu. Once out of the Kathmandu valley the snow covered mountains are very picturesque, and everyone has a window seat for clear views. The image with review was taken from the cockpit."
Stunning ,"We'd done some trekking in Nepal but I'm in no way fit enough to hike base camp so I decided to cheat and get on a plane to see the peak and wow! It's stunning. We went with yeti airlines and, although it's not cheap it's well worth it.  The airline looks after you and will only set off if you're guaranteed a view of the peak.  To be honest I was still dubious because the weather was rotten on the ground but then we got through the clouds and saw the peaks like little islands about the fluffy white clouds. A great experience."
Highest Mountain's Enchanting Nature Experience,"In our nature I find the most breathtaking view of Mt. Everest which is covered with fair white snow.  People think it is very hard trek to the Mt. Everest Base camp. Actually we should climb slowly but regularly, it would become easier. Try once and enjoy the Entire beautiful nature and scenario."
Breathtaking,Took a helicopter to see the peak and was absolutely incredibly. I know it can be expensive but it is well worth it.
been till  base camp,the experience is amazing ... go early morning .. spent full day ... relax .. play enjoy in kumbhu glacier ... dont come for short visit
Very arduous,"The whole Himalaya experience is not a 'fun' trip. By neccessity it involves steep walks in very thin air. Very little luxury on route. Don't be fooled by the 'anyone who's fit can do it' line of some trekking agencies. I personally witnessed fit people falter.... BUT there are stupendous views and you get to say ""I MADE IT!!""... in peak season there are hundreds on the trek, like a line of ants all the way to Everest base camp..."
ebc+ 3 passes trek- 17 days of trekking,"Trek is good but purely going to ebc will not do- much of the beauty lies in 3 passes - renjola, chola and kongma la passes-renjola tough as u climb 4500 ft  in one days while going to gokyo-need to reach at top by 12:00 pm  otherwise it will snow and trek become tough-food is expensive-cold medicine must-i went will adventure nation - expensive - aggregator- agent rude and our guide didn't carry oxygen tank and medicine etcbut trek was good includes gokyo and kala patharu will get lakes, glacier and clouds-0need fitness level otherwise likely to have ams though diamox helps"
Life time Experience,"Started off my journey to Everest base camp and Mount Kalapathar from a small town called Jiri, North of Kathmandu. We flew from Sri Lanka to Chennai and took the train up north. Didn't work with any tour groups but we were accompanied by a veteran trekker who had gone to base camp more than 10 times. It was a difficult first few days getting used to the climate and the trek but eventually every things was working fine. You have to climb at your own pace acclimatizing your self. You have to drink plenty of water. We didn't have any Diamox but you should consider for altitude sickness. Its an achievable task with some amazing views along the valley."
Top of the World,"Words can't describe the achievement of reaching Everest Base Camp and seeing Mt Everest up closeIt is a hard slog - and we had 6 of our group ultimately choppered off to Kathmandu hospital with AMS - but achievable if you do the training, take it slow and acclimatise, considered taking Diamox, and drink plenty of water.If you get the chance, take it."
EBC,It was a refreshing break from a dull corporate life ! Only suggestion is to take it slow and acclamatise wherever your feeling there's a need to push.
"Difficult, but beautiful!","The trek to Everest Base Camp is difficult, but doable. We did a 15 day trek with Mountain Sherpa Trekking and had a fantastic time. I highly recommend this company due to excellent service and communication, a great guide who was very helpful and understanding, and wonderful porters. Here are a few tips for those considering the trek to Everest Base Camp: The standard route is 12 days, but I highly recommended customizing your itinerary and adding an additional day or two in order to allow for flexibility and for better acclimatization. There are unforeseen circumstances that could occur (such as developing a gastrointestinal infection or altitude sickness) and you may need to use that extra day to adjust your itinerary; it could make the difference in being able to continue the trek or not. A few suggestions are to trek from Phakding to Jorsalle instead of straight to Namche to break up the long, steep ascent to Namche or to trek from Dingboche to Thukla instead of straight to Lobuche as this provides better acclimatization as altitude sickness becomes common at around this elevation. In order to prevent altitude sickness, walk slowly, drink at least 3 liters of water per day, and I recommend taking Diamox as a supplement to natural acclimatization, not as a replacement. In my opinion and experience, Diamox definitely helps. I started the trek not taking Diamox and monitored my oxygen levels daily. By day 4 (acclimatization day in Namche), my oxygen levels had dropped to 78%. I started taking Diamox and rechecked my oxygen levels a few hours later and my blood oxygen levels had gone up to 90% and remained in the 90’s for the majority of the trek. I highly recommend bringing an oximeter with you on the trek so that you can personally monitor your own oxygen levels. I never experienced any form of headache or symptoms of altitude sickness during the trek, though I did get sick on the food/water; gastrointestinal infections are common on this trek. In comparison to a Kilimanjaro climb, this trek is luxury. Wifi is readily available throughout the trek - sometimes free, sometimes for a cost ($3-$6). There are battery charging stations at every lodge for a small cost, availability to purchase Coca Cola, snickers bars, beer, etc… Some fantastic coffee shops and bakeries along the way, such as the Himalayan Java coffee shop in Namche (best brownie ever, I highly recommend). Plenty of opportunity to purchase any last minute supplies or gear in Namche from clothing to memory cards for your camera to phone chargers.As for the time of year, I did this trek at the end of March through the beginning of April, just before the trails started to get busy and crowded. This was a great time of the year to go as the weather was great (warmer than we expected, only snowed one day) and we avoided the overly crowded trails and lodges, yet were still able to see tents set up at Everest Base Camp. We reached Everest Base Camp on March 31st. This is a beautiful trek. The Himalayas are stunning and outstanding. I would highly recommend this trek to anyone seeking an adventure and an incredible experience, just research and prepare as this is a difficult trek (I was not in shape nor do I exercise regularly but I still made it, but I do not recommend going in “as is” condition if you aren't in good fitness as it will just make it unnecessarily harder on yourself when there are already enough variables that will make this trek difficult). But for anyone considering this trek, just do it, you won’t ever regret it, it is worth it!"
Base Camp Trek is a trip of a lifetime,"I did an 18 day trek in Nepal with REI.  In addition to a few days for visiting Kathmandu, our group of 10 trekkers spent 14 days walking through some of the villages in Sagarmatha National Park between Lukla and Everest Base Camp.  The views at just about every moment were spectacular with many incredibly high mountains in every direction. The trail took us up and down mountain sides along glacier fed rivers so there was a lot of up and downhill hiking which helped us acclimatize to the very high altitude. With REI, some of the time we camped in the yards of guesthouses in the Himalayan villages and some of the time we had a bed in a room, so it is not exactly back country backpacking, although it is rustic with little to no heating.  Nonetheless, it was not particularly uncomfortable.  We only had to carry our day pack with 1-2 liters of water.  Tasty and healthy hot food was prepared for us 3 times a day and even included pizza a couple of times, and potatoes all the time.  The guides and other helpers were wonderful - helpful and friendly. We were fortunate to have an outstanding lead guide, Thubten Sherpa, a former Buddhist monk who grew up in the area and is a vast font of local lore as well as very enthusiastic and happy.  Anyone interested in this trek should love hiking and be fairly fit, but it isn't like summitting Everest or anything.  I'm 64 and didn't find it terribly strenuous because they go at a slow pace, only hiking 4-6 hours/day. My trip was in April which is the optimum time of year (actually the warmest, driest time of year)."
Amazing life experience,"Definitely one of my favourite experiences in Himalaya. We did the 3 day hike, which is not to be considered easy, but 100% worth it. My only criticism is that considering Everest is a national park, there was a lot of litter and was not very looked after well due to many campers - bit of a shame to see such a beautiful area not truly appreciated. Would love to do it again one day but this time bring proper walking shoes (we proved it was possible in trainers, if you want to fall over loads)"
"Amazing Trip,  Important  Tips To Everyone",I am climb to base camp of Mount Everest from Lukla. I spent 2days prior in Kathmandu. I did this trek with my girlfriend and 2 of my friends and they did a fantastic job. Our guides and porters were awesome! If you are looking for truly the adventure of lifetime then this is a must!Sent from my ASUS
Base camp,"Amazing expereince. Not too strenuous of an expedition, however need some fitness and conditioning for the trek. Depends how well your body adapts to altitude. Highly recommend!"
Most Beautiful,"We when do hike on Everest middle of April. It was breathtaking view to see Mt. Everest from several different locations while trekking for 15 days to go to Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar, Gokyo lake .we are really enjoyed this mount even exhausted."
The lucky few to stay at Everest Base Camp,"I highly recommend the EBC trek. Anyone in fairly good shape can tackle the trek as all the strength that's required is simply the ability to walk. Yes, there are steep hills (particularly Namche Hill) and it's a long way to go, but it is just a walk. The views are gorgeous...it's hard to take in the vastness of the landscape and the height of the mountains. With that said, I highly recommend doing your research if you are going to trek with a company. Only three or four companies have permission for trekkers to stay at EBC. Everyone else has to walk to the EBC prayer flag mound, and after taking some photos, turns around there. You haven't actually even walked in to Base Camp at this point. The company I used Alpine Adventures enabled us to spend two nights at EBC which was incredible. Also, note that base camp (with tents and people living there) are only there seasonally in the spring when expeditions set up camp for those trying to summit Everest."
"Top of the world ,","since May 23 , 1953 , the day when Edmund and Tenzing reached the submit , mount Everest is dream of Everest Mountaineer, it looks dam exciting and superb."
Nice Experience,We did hike on Everest it's was so really nice mount with snow.Our experience was so nice.Highly recommended for everyone to try this even only one in your life.
Everest Base Camp - A Once in a Lifetime Trek,"We trekked with our two sons, aged 10 and 12, from Lukla to Everest Base Camp. The vistas were spectacular. We travelled in March/April 2017 and the weather during the day was bright, sunny and warm. Temperatures in the evening dropped very quickly to well below zero so make sure you have good kit to keep you warm.The trek is certainly doable for a family although we saw only 2 other children in the 14 days we were trekking. We took it slowly, adding in plenty of extra acclimatisation time. We stayed in Phakding, Monjo, Namche (3 nights), Deboche, Thugla, Dingboche (2 nights), lobouche, Gorak shep along the way.The very best views of Everest are from the summit of Kala Pathar rather than Base Camp, although Base Camp itself is a sight to behold. I would highly recommend this adventure to any outdoorsy type family but do your research first as some of the days are long!"
Tour With Small Tenzin,"Just back from 10 day trip to Tibet. Completed the 8 day overland tour to base camp through Tibet Vista Tours. I had been looking to go to Base Camp on Everest for many years and this one hit the mark. The company did a great job of keeping us posted on needed Visa, and when in Tibet we were hosted by our Guide Small Tenzin. He went above and beyond! He did a great job as tour guide and answered all our questions. Additionally he always ensured our well being as we explored and experienced Tibet."
What can I say that hasn't  been say...,Beautiful views.  You stand in awe and offer up your most humblest of respect to this mountain that has taken many lives and offered so many hope of summit.  Many great locations to view
One of the most difficult treks done so far!,"Trekking through the villages from Lukla airport crossing several suspension bridges dangling over Dudh Kosi river especially the infamous Hillary bridge.. Sherpas are really made of steel - one should see the amount the goods they carry to the top with ease.. Dzos (hybrid between cow and yak) are abundant carrying heavy goods trekking along with us.. As we go higher, the air gets thinner & thinner; one can see some people suffering from high altitude sickness especially above 3500m and the helicopters fly like autos to assist the people who need evacuation.. Trekked/climbed Kalapathar (5644m) which was the highest point I have trekked so far! Every day was adventurous and exciting with breathtaking panoramic views of the mountains, valleys, the gigantic snow clad peaks, friendly natives and guides/porters, cool fellow trekkers from all over the world, good food with cosy beds at tea houses.. Overall it was an epic and crazy trek to the base camp of the world’s highest peak - The Everest"
"Yes, it is the best trip",Mount Everest in in to Sagarmatha National Park. It took several hours from Gorashep to Base camp and Back to Goreshep. But It looks very beautiful. Every one should go to Everest Base camp at list once of their life.
See The World's Tallest Natural Skyscraper,Sagarmatha national park treasures world's tallest mountain Everest 8850m. Adventurous trek in this mystic land of himalaya will no doubt gives higher thoughts and vision.
Reality check ,"OK.  People will trek to EBC for personal reasons. I have trekked all 4 valleys in the everest region and many other Trails in the world. I find EBC nothing special as you trekk mostly in a gravel pit. It's over commercialized and much to much drama talk how tough the trekk is. When in reality it's very easy compare to other Trails. There are to many people going for the bragging rights when they should start smaller Trails at bottom to get in shape. I give it a good rating as I get great lough seeing people with 1000th of dollars of new gear and strougle, when you can hike it in sweatpants and a jacket. Mine as well watch the ""wanne be trekkers"" as you can't see Mount Everest from basecamp anyway.  Good luck."
EBC - Trek of a lifetime,"Did a standard 12-day EBC trek with a local trek agent. A dream fulfilled! Everest can already be seen during the first few days of the trek. Views are absolutely stunning - they were my motivation and reward on each day of the trek. February is low season (end winter), so most of the time we had the place to ourselves. One gets to enjoy the majestic Himalayas in quiet solitude at one's own pace without having to worry about jams and crowds. Downside is that the weather is unpredictable. Since it was Feb, be prepared to trek and sleep in harsh conditions. It got super cold and windy the day we set off for EBC and it started snowing lightly with relentless winds and a lot of clouds on our way back from EBC. A Nalgene bottle might be a better idea than a water bladder because my water tube was frozen for the entire day where we headed for EBC so I didn't drink much that entire day of trekking. Worth every bit of the experience though!"
One off my Bucket List,"What can I say, we had the most perfect day to travel by Buddha Airlines to fly over Mount Everest.  An amazing day, breathtaking."
You must see it to believe it.,"You must be fairly fit to be able to trek to ME base camp. Altitude sickness can be problem if you do not acclimatise properly. Do not underestimate it as it can be very dangerous. One member of our group, who was much fitter than me, deteriorated so quickly that we had to call helicopter to take him to hospital where he stayed for a week. Fortunately he fully recovered. But on the positive note, trek is amazing. You can't beat the views and clean air. We went in December and yes it was very cold, but we met hardly anyone on the trek. Climbing Khala Phatthar is definitely worth the effort. Views of ME from there are breathtaking. Intrepid, who I booked the trip with were very professional. We had amazing sherpas, guides and they were all friendly and mainly professional. I felt always safe and everyone was looking after each other. We were great team and it was proper team effort to reach base camp. What surprised me the most was how dusty the trek was. I wasn't prepared for so much dust. I think vaseline would help to prevent your nostrils to get very dry. And take something you can cover your mouth and nose with while walking. I was lucky that one guy had two ""scarfs"" (I am not sure how it is called) so I could keep my face covered.Do not hesitate and give this trek a try. It is something you will remember for the rest of your life."
Amazing highest peak,Highest peak of the world is an amazing place to see. i trek to Everest base camp and Kala Patthar many times i like this destination very much. go to explore once in a life time highly recommended destination.
Top Travelling destination,"One of the most attractive destination in Nepal,where the worlds highest Mountain with other 3 snow capped  Mountains over 8000 m can be seen..."
overwhelming,"you have to do this once in your life. The views along the way are great. It is a bit difficult of a trek, but worth it."
"Amazing Trip,  Important  Tips to the trekkers.","To be  a Tour and Trekking  guide in Nepal as well as group organizer,  I have  trekked Everest region many times via every route (EBC/Chola pass Via Gokyo Lake/ Renjola Pass Via Thame, Kalapatthar through Kongma-La pass via Chhukhung  ect).  overall of  my clients are very happy  with this trek and amazing  view of Mountain. from second day of trek, we can see the view of  the world highest mountain Everest, Beautiful View of Amadablam is another major attraction of this trek.  Panoramic View of above 8000 meter mountain   from Gokyo Ri is highly  recommended.Here some tips for the  trekkers who willing  to do this trekking. The first thing to consider is whether you want a guide and porters. If you want to go cheap, then carry your own gear and get a map. Trekking maps are abundant in Kathmandu and cost from $3-5 (not so easy to find here in your country). Most treks take standard routes. Several websites that offer trekking services outline the trekking routes and you can easily follow their suggested routes. The routes are designed so that you don’t go up more than about 400 m elevation per day as you acclimate. Some of the days are short (3 hr hiking) but if you’re not acclimated it is wise not to go up too fast. If you get altitude sickness, your trip is over. Also, there’s no reason to hurry. Slow down and enjoy the scenery.The villages along the way all have teahouses that offer sleeping and eating accommodations. Villages that are part of the standard trekking route and stop are well equipped with several tea houses other villages may only have 1 or 2. During the peak season (Oct – Nov.), a room costs about 300-400 rupees per person per night and 200 rupees/night in the off-season (exchange rate are more or less ~95:1 ). Most rooms are doubles, some triples. The teahouses can fill up during peak season and for the same price you can sleep on the floor in the dining room. The benefits of a guide is that they have connections and can call ahead and get a room (if there is cell phone service). It is pretty quiet in September to December and March to May of the years.. Several groups hiking in around Christmas time Lots of places close up after December.You are expected to eat at the teahouse where you stay. Most teahouses offer the same menu so it doesn’t really matter. Breakfast can be eggs with bread (Tibetan bread, chipati or really dry white toast), oatmeal, yogurt with fruit. Breakfast will typically cost you about 400-500 rupees. Prices go up the further you are from valley to as everything is carried in by porters and yak. Lunch and dinner are the same menu. High in carbohydrates (rice, spaghetti, noodles, french fries) with a little meat and veggies. Some places had yak steaks – a nice alternative to the carbos. Dinners will cost about 700-1000 rupees.If you decide to hire a guide and porters, Better ! there are over 1000 trekking agencies in Kathmandu as well as several international agencies and some individuals, It is highly competitive and you can barter over the price or you can randomly walked into a couple agencies.Touch The Himalaya Treks and Expedition is one among them, which is located in the center of town more accessable location. The agency should give you two options: 1) you pay in advance for food, lodging, guide and porters, or 2 is called package trip) you pay in advance for the guide and porters and pay for your own food and lodging (is called only hiring trip) . The guides and porters have a set salary that includes their food and lodging. I’m not sure what the guide and porters actually get paid, they have several rules of trekking agencies but the agency will quote you a price that includes their profit – this is a negotiating point.You also need to pay the airfare for the guide and porters to get to some remote location (or wherever you are going) but Nepali prices are much cheaper than for foreigners. Porters typically are hired locally. The agency also will arrange for your travel to wherever.You need to bring enough rupees with you to cover all your basic expenses while trekking. The advantage of paying for the entire trip in advance is that the guide will responsible for paying for everything (except for extra drinks, snacks). . All you have to o do was hike and your guide take care of everything else – pick out the tea house where you would stay, got your rooms, paid the bill at the end of your stay, etc. The downside to this option is that for some reason you cut your trip short (bad weather, health issues), you will not be reimbursed.Other things to consider:Boiled and bottled water is expensive, especially in the higher elevation villages (~350 rs/liter). Bring a water filter.You need a government issued TIMS card to go trekking ($20) that has to be purchased in Kathmandu. Bring 2 passport size photos or you will need to get photos in Kathmandu. The trekking agency will get these for you.You also need a National Park and conservation area permit These can be purchased when you enter the park or conservation area, but it’s easier to get it in advance in Kathmandu. Again, if you hire a guide, the agency will get this for you.Happy Trekking."
The mountains take you there but the people will keep you coming back,"The adventure was trekking to Everest Base Camp but the experience was Nepal, the people and culture were amazing. From the rich, vibrant streets of the Kathmandu city to the remote vast expanse of the high Himalayas were such contrasts. I love so much about Nepal and this tour with Ruff Diamond Adventures was extraordinary. Trekking in the months of December to January was very cold but we had the trails alomost to ourselves as well as clear sky days and a bit of snow to top it off."
NOTHING BEATS SEEING THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN ON EARTH! BEST DAY EVER!!,I trekked to base camp of Mount Everest from Lukla. I spent 3 days prior in Kathmandu. I did this trek with G Adventures and they did a fantastic job. Our guides and porters were awesome! If you are looking for truly the adventure of lifetime then this is a MUST!
A Must for any Aventurer,"Completed the classic Lukla-Lukla/Base Camp, hike during the Christmas/New Year period, accompanied by nine other frozen souls. The hike isn't too taxing, if the individual is relatively fit, accustomed to the outdoors and has basic hiking experience; but with good guides and a strong will it is manageable for most.Base Camp,  in December, is a cold and barren place. Don't come expecting to see the tents' of climbers waiting for the off......what you will see is a boulder strewn glacier (which Base Camp is based upon), which is fed by the Kombu ice flow, and a pile of rocks with a banner saying 'Congratulations'. But the scenery is breathless, and the mountain range set in front of you leave that feeling of true scale of the Himalayas.Getting to Base Camp via foot in winter is hard work from the off and care needs to be given to both the relentless cold and the ever present altitude. But this is outweighed by the sights and experiences in making it to Base Camp thus making it truly about the journey and not the destination."
Travel to Nepal,"The Most memorable trip in my life, unforgettable, unbelievable.To see all Himalayas mountains and Everest himself worth it 100 %Stunning Impressive and Amazing"
Amazing EBC,"November 2016 - Just amazing. The views are breathtaking (as is the altitude!), the atmosphere is buzzing even though nearly everybody is exhausted and the culture has to be seen. Watching the sun rise and set over Everest is something I will never forget. The Sherpas are great, the food is delicious (most of the time) and although tough at times, the best trek I have done so far. Don't hesitate, just book it and make sure you have put in the training so you can really enjoy it!"
Trek of lifetime,"May 2016: End of summertime, best time for summit attempts also. We were a group of 10 with 3 ladies in it. Most of us were never serious trekkers but yes we had a common thing: Love for nature. We trained for 2-3 months in Hyderabad prior to this trip. Our trip was 11 days long From lukla to EBC then back to Lukla. We had booked a guide in kathmandu who arranged tickets and tea house reservations for us. You can hire a porter at Lukla or Namche bazar, remember the higher you go, all things including porters is going northwards. Book tickets up and down in advance from KTM to Lukla.(if u booked tour with operator they will set it up for u) free weight is 15kgs in flight.

Make your STRONG wish to visit Everest region.,"Top of the roof has taken stunning views of the mountain and antique culture and tradition from the period of eudmond and Tenjing, more of changed thing is development in economic level but not other thing like help and respect and smile from those past. regarding the scene and the terrain that i experience in my every visit as a guide i never found tired of the place and never tired to see that clear sky with snow capped Mountain cascade. One of the great place i feel relax. Make your time nice here. Namche, Luckla, Ghorakshep and monasteries like Tengboche with real history is great make yourself great."
EBC in December ,"My daughter, my son, and I did the 12 day EBC trekking in December.  It was just wonderful.   It does get cold at night but during the day, with sun, it's actually very pleasant.  December seems to be a good month as you enjoy the trails and teahouses without being crowded, and it's before the rainy season.  We started hiking  Dec 14 and finished by the 26th, which was right before the Christmas crowd showing up. We did Kalapathar the night before EBC for sunset, which is the best time to do it as you would have the most spectacular views of the Everest summit both before and during sunset. The company we used was Mega Advanture.  They were well organized and accommodating."
Everest base camp trek,"In September 2016 I travelled to Nepal as part if a group, some of us knew some people and some were meeting for the first time. We spent a couple of days in Kathmandu resting and acclimatizing. It is a real old and beautiful city. Yes of course there is poverty by western standards but I did not see the same begging culture I saw in other 'third world' countries. As a woman I did not feel intimidated and felt comfortable wandering side streets.  We visited Durbar square where the devastation of the 2015 is clearly visible. If you need anything for your trek strongly advise you buy in Kathmandu, shops after here are much more expensive. I got a sleeping bag for around 20 euro, trekking poles for about a fiver & altitude sickness tablets super cheap. Shops have everything you would need and well known brands, to me some stuff looked like seconds but totally fine for price you are paying. Next we flew on a small propeller plane to Lukla. This flight for me was one of my trip highlights, the majority of the flight is over the Himalayas.. It is stunning as you view the incredible expanse of this immense mountain range and can see tiny remote villages dotted along the range. I won't talk much about the plane, the landing or lukla airport as this is well documented already however just to say that for me it was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life and shall never forget...just relax and enjoy it! There are no roads from Lukla onwards so every single thing must be carried on a porters back, it is very humbling and gives a real appreciation for all those western consumables we think we need. On arrival at Lukla we had a short break for tea, met our Sherpa team and the trek started! Just a side note at this point regarding fitness! I am very moderate fitness level and my preparation for this trip was mainly in the gym so I knew I would find this tough. I am not a hillwalker so have limited experience. Honestly my plan was to take it one day at a time, don't think on tomorrow and as I learned much later in the trip take one step at a time and just keep moving forward. Remainder of the group were a mix, some very experienced hill walkers and some less so. Due to the number of Sherpa everyone was able to go at their own pace without feeling they were holding others back which is really really important, no matter fitness levels everyone had a tough day at some stage. We were a group of 16 with 5 Sherpa and our main guide who organized the whole trip. Always one Sherpa at the front and one at the back so no worries :)  If all else fails sheer will and determination works too! After a tough trek over many many many steps we reached Phakding for our first night in a beautiful lodge by the magnificent Dudh Kosi river which became the background music for my trek.  Memories flood back of dhal bhat and garlic at this point.. you must eat eat eat...keep it plain and honestly just stick with dhal bhat everyday! We also met our yak at this point who carried all our luggage point to point everyday. Next day we had many crossings over huge suspension bridges which are covered with prayer flags. The scenery is stunning, really breathtaking and so lush. After a beautiful trek we arrived in Namche Bazaar. This is a pretty town with large range of shops. I bought a hydration pack for my daypack here and some snacks. This really is last point if you need to buy anything but be warned it is expensive. We had a rest day here to acclimatize which is strongly recommended. We trekked onwards and stayed in Thyangboche which was another highlight. There is a beautiful monastery which we visited and mentally this spiritual region and its sheer beauty gave me strength, I already felt I had reached my Everest base camp. We travelled on to Dingbouche and said goodbye to my normally good appetite. During an acclimatization trek the following day I literally hit a wall around 4500 mtrs. From this point onwards I struggled through every meal, sometimes taking more than an hour to finish a meal but I knew I needed to keep eating or I could not continue. I must reiterate the sights and sounds during the trip are just amazing... The peaks, valleys, foliage, landscape, suspension bridges, rocks, sounds of the river, porters running in flip flops with immense loads, tinkling bells from yak...I have no more superlatives...unforgettable.Another highlight was our final trek to everest base camp. We left around 4am, we all trekked close together over streams and rock only lit by our headlamps... A truly magical experience. We stopped for a rest and breakfast around 9 am. Our plan was to reach base camp around noon before clouds came in.  Those final few hours were among those difficult i have ever experienced. My mode of walking at this point could only be compared to those images we have seen of Neil Armstrong walking in the moon. My pace was slower than a snail and I was utterly exhausted due to fitness and effects of altitude. I wore everything in my pack and just carried water. Finally and slowly I made it.   Undoubtedly a huge sense of achievement. Cup of tea, snickers bar, few photos and the trek home started!I travelled with Namaste Nomad (Mohan) and I could not recommend him enough. He looked after us, making sure we were eating correctly, watching us always for any signs of sickness, guiding, encouraging and advising all the team. We had a fixed price package which included flights, accommodation, food etc I would definitely do another trip with him.If you are thinking about doing this inspirational trek my advice is don't wait until next year or the next milestone in your life, do it now! Hope this review helps alleviate any concerns you might have :)"
Everest Base Camp Trek November 2016,"Flight from Kathmandu to Lukla took awhile while the guides and airline argued about weight.  We finally boarded the bus to the plane and waited half an hour for it to refuel, took some picture of sunrise over the airport.The flight was pretty uneventful but lots of excitement from what we read earlier.  Once we landed it was a 7 days walked from Lukla to Pakding, Namcher Bazaar, Tengboche, Dingboche, Loboche, GorakShep, up to the base camp and back to Gorakshep for the night.Kala Patthar was the high light.  After that, instead of Chola, we did a long trek to Periche, back up and after a couple of days, Gokyo.It was my first winter without heating, abide the Yak dung stove between 6 to 9 every evening at the dining halls of tea houses.  Himalayan high way of paths between 3 to 6 ft on average, catering for human, yak, hourse and donkey traffic both ways.  dusty mud trails and trails of rocks, most of the time loose rocks.  Rooms made of ply wood with no insulations.  Still it was a journey worth taking and a most unique view I would never forget.  Thanks to the guides and porters to help us make it.  A memorable 17 days on the trail.What to pack, only essential plus a hot water flask.  You're only allowed 10kg pack + 5 Kg day pack.Get water filters, it gets very expensive as you go higher.  You need lots of it.Wear layers, especially at the start winter, you go from freezing to hot and sweater and next minute freezing again.Wet wipes, Sun screen, buff or face mask.  very dusty place.  Good - rating sleeping bag, thermal wear.when you see pack animal coming your way, stay on the mountain side and get out of their way.watch you step all the way, stop when you want to enjoy the scenery or take picture.  Do not walk and do both.look out for wild animals in some of the trails, including long haired Tahr mountain goats.The scenery is absolutely stunning."
amazing,"This was the best trip I have ever done in my life. The people, the trip, the country, it was just amazing. The scenery is just breath taking."
"Everest Bast Camp, Cho La Pass, Gokyo Valley 17 day Trek",This trek is rated 5 star because of outstanding scenic value but equally 5 star because of the top notch local company we used. Six of us from Canada signed up with NEPAL VISION TREKS and from start to finish we were not disappointed. Excellent service from guiding to porters to daily decisions made and things definitely change along the way. Just one things to say 'DO IT'. Epic trip of a lifetime.
Book your Everest trekking trip with Nepal Vision Treks!,"Had an amazing 21 day Everest 3 passes trek with Nepal Vision Treks in October 2016. After months of research, I chose Nepal Vision Treks because of their fantastic professionalism (fast communication by email before the trip answering all questions, extra inclusions, professionalism and logistical wizards before and after the trip, and amazing cultural interpreters). They met or exceeded every expectation I had! Highly recommended for trekking in the Everest region. I would use them again in a heartbeat."
Trekking Everest Three Passes,"This a spectacular trek to do and we thankfully decided to go with a local company, Green Valley Nepal Treks, who were awesome to deal with from start to finish. We'd done Kilimanjaro last year and decided to up our game and tackle the three passes with Jommy(Jami) as our local guide from Green Valley. We made the decision to also have a porter - and why not? - carrying just a day pack takes the edge off an already strenuous 16 days and let's you enjoy the stunning environment you are in just that little bit more. It's also putting money back into the locals pockets as the team we had were from the region - a region still recovering from the 2015 earthquake.Our trek covered 16 days with two acclimitization days. Don't skip these days, because a lot of the helicopters you see racing up and down the valley in the first few days of walking aren't usually rich sightseers but medivacs taking ill trekkers out! Listen to your guide, take the necessary acclimitization days and don't get caught up in the need to rush. You will probably pay for it later and further up.The Three Passes trek, once you get off the Everest Base Camp trail, is a lot quieter and we met great people doing it solo or with guides/porters. You also get to experience the beautiful Gokyo Lakes region. The middle section from the Kongma La through to Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar and then on to the Cholo Pass is where your crave a rest day but there really is no where to do this, so battle on to Gokyo and enjoy some time off plus there's also the world's highest bakery.  Pack a solar charger if you can, it was the best thing I brought with me as I used my phone as a camera and it's expensive and not really that reliable getting the teahouses to charge your electronics up. I didnt really even need to hike with it as there was always enough sun at the end of the day's walk to cram in a bit of charging time. Also our guide advised us NOT to eat meat and as someone who usually gets sick, I thankfully had minimal issues in this department by following his advice. We heard some horror stories of people eating Yak steaks in Namche Bizarre  just two days into their trips and falling ill and having to be airlifted out. Splash out on the occasional bucket of warm water for a shower (400rp). It just makes you feel a little human again and you've earned it. This will be an amazing journey with spectacular scenery as your back drop and the Nepalese people are lovely.Green Valley Nepal Treks own several hotels in Kathmandu - so that's all sorted for arrival and departure plus the lovely Arjun arranged for us do a day's sightseeing around Kathmandu after our trek as well as transfers to and from the airport for international/Lukla flights."
Breathtaking!,"What an amazing experience! I’ve known Karma from Sherpa Mountain Adventures for awhile and finally decided to go on the Good Karma Trek and it was absolutely amazing. From the second we got out of the airport, we felt welcomed and right at home with the Sherpa Mountain Adventure staff. The sherpas, cooks, and everyone else associated with the company were absolutely amazing. I will never forget the wonderful connections I made with all of them. Also, SMA seems to attract a certain type of trekker - fun and open minded and easy to get along with. By the end we all felt like family which made the overall experience way more comfortable and fun. The sherpas set a great pace for each day of trekking and made sure everyone was feeling their best and had what they needed to continue. The views were beyond breathtaking, I never imagined I’d see so many incredible mountains in my lifetime. This is definitely a once in a lifetime experience and highly recommended! I made some lifetime memories and friendships!"
Most Beautiful Mountain surrounded by many other mountains,"It was breathtaking view to see Mt. Everest from several different locations while trekking for 15 days to go to Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar, Gokyo lake etc."
Base Camp Everest Trek,"I not only want to share information about this awesome 12 day hike, but highlight the professional service that my family and I received from Imperial Nepal Treks. From the very efficient Paras Khanal who organised our itinerary and answered all my questions by email and then added the personal touch by meeting us at our hotel in Kathmandu, before our adventure and then generously spoiling us with a farewell dinner on our return to the bustling, crazy city of Kathmandu, to Sujan our guide, who met us at the airport and took us for a welcome dinner accompanied by Nepalese cultural dancing. A really relaxed start to the physically demanding climb to base camp. Imperial Nepal Treks organised our accommodation at each of the villages in which we stayed and I would highly recommend paying upfront for them to organise all the meals. These were so wholesome with loads of food too. We were never hungry! Sujan is a wonderful guide, very friendly, caring and always prepared to go that extra mile. Our porters were two young Nepalese lads, Tilak and Jasnak, so strong and always smiling. I think that the beautiful mountain scenery somehow infuses a calm, beautiful spirit into the Nepalese people. Even the yak and donkey trains were a pleasure - strong, purposeful and not aggressive. It was a privilege to escape the rigors of big city life and explore the wonders of Sagarmatha National Park, the stupas and prayer flags, the emotional memorials to fallen climbers and to hike alongside the amazing Khumbu Glacier in order to reach base camp. I will return to do the Annapurna Circuit, sooner rather than later and will not hesitate to employ the services of Imperial Nepal Treks. Bistari jam jam!"
Base camp revisited after 30 years,"Uncompairable trekking thanks to the First Environmental Trekking company which allowed me to make my own itinerary in the Solo Khumbu. We went from Lukla to EBC and then to Gokyo, but not over the Cho La.  We rounded the valley by the other side and went by Pangboche, Phortse and Thare to Dragnag, crossed the Ngozumpa glacier and went so to Gokyo where we stayed for a couple of days. Climbed the Gokyo Ri and hiked around and found a spot which I ratter keep to myself. So we wondered around for 21 days...me, My eldest daughter and three friends. An uncompairable trekking experience at our own pace."
Nepal Vision Treks  is a very professional    team,"My wife and I did EBC trek in Oct 2016. Mr Chet Bhatta is a very professional manager and makes sure that every trekker feels comfortable, beginning with pickup from the airport, inbetween, and ending with dropoff at the airport.  The tea houses he booked for us were excellent and we felt at home.   Food was always excellent and tea houses were very clean.  Our Guide Khem and our porter Luk were very friendly.   The Apsara hotel in Kathmandu, where we stayed, has an excellent location in the Thamel bazaar. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who want to do trekking without worrying about the company.   btw It was my fourth  trip to Nepal for trekking/climbing with Chet."
Milk Lake Trek,"When your daughter asks you to go trekking with her in the Himalayas, the only answer is yes. Of course, I agreed without realizing what I was really getting into. However, with Sherpa Mountain Adventures (SMA) the worries were quickly taken away, and the only thing to think about was walking, observing the majestic Himalayan landscape, and enjoying yourself and the company of your fellow trekker(s).I reviewed several trekking companies and happen to come across a review for SMA which was interesting and comprehensive enough that it led me to contact Karma, the owner. I described my situation, my needs, and my concerns. I had 12 days maximum,  including travel time. I wanted to meet the people, visit the villages, see how they live, and experience the culture. I preferred not to be with throngs of hiking tourists and crowds. He presented two options: Poon Hill, which sounded amazing,  and a custom made trek, which fit my desires better. After discussing it with my daughter, we chose the latter option. We would go to Milk Lake at an elevation of 15,000 feet and back in one week. It would be more challenging and difficult in many ways, including more isolation, technically demanding terrain, higher altitude, and colder temperatures. This itinerary took us out of our comfort zone, but the pay off was worth it 10 times over. Our guide, Furba, was outstanding! He was knowledgeable, kind, patient, and always concerned about our safety, which in my opinion trumps all other qualities of a guide. We hiked the mountains, the forests, through villages, met the local people, visited a monastery, and spent time with Furpa's family in his village home. Karma arranged for us to have a kitchen crew to help avoid food born illness, a common ailment of trekking in the wilderness. We slept in tents five of the seven trekking nights, a tea house and Furba's  home the other two. The camping was all set up ahead of time by the team. There was a cooking crew which prepared three delicious meals and an abundance of hot tea every day. The sherpas (with 4 yaks!) carried all the equipment including our clothing that was not needed during the day. The behind the scenes action that goes on to make your experience comfortable is unbelievable. The members of our crew were professionals, individuals who grew up in the mountains, and many of them have assisted on Everest treks. They are the real deal.It was a trip of a lifetime, but not easy if you are wanting the comforts of home. I did my research, spoke with references, and did some soul searching long and hard to confirm this is what I wanted for me and my daughter. Karma said, ""I love people, and I like to take care of people."" After speaking with him, I was convinced those words were coming from his heart, and that we would be in good hands. Karma is like all the Nepalese people we met...peaceful, kind, and generous. I hope this review is helpful. Safe travels!!"
Nice views and fresh air,"Lovely to take in this part of the world. Me the wife are keen ramblers and after walking around for many hours you would never guess were we ended up?!.... Only the summit! Lol 😊 Once I gathered me breath (haha) it were a cracking view of Tibet and the surrounding.........world! Can't fault it for clean fresh thin air. However, call me captain killjoy, nae call us 'Mr and Mrs Picky' (as they often do at the village bridge club), there were things that could be better...I'm sure I'm not the only rambler who wouldn't mind light refreshments of some sort during his/ her walk. I was quite pooped once 'up top' of this hill.....I was hoping for a small cafe or bistro to warm me cockles, but no, not even one of them vending machines selling choccies and condiments!! I'm sorry but if it's tourists that are the life blood of these beauty spots then we simply gotta have better facilities. Another niggle was a simple lack of signage. The missus nearly walked clean off the Kangshung Face! Me and our Sherpa 'Tengtin' were in stitches at the time, silly old girl. However on a serious note, a small notice to say maybe 'Caution, keep to the left. Unsteady rock and drop of 3.5km' would be wise. Still I'm not letting these small niggles blemish what was a lovely afternoon 'walking in the great outdoors!'. Would recommend Everest to family and friends, just wear a good bobbly hat, it's abit blowy, lol."
Imperial Nepal Treks: a Wonderful Company with which to Hike EBC,"My family and I recently trekked to Everest Base Camp (EBC) with Imperial Nepal Trek (INT) and this company really did so much for us to make our experience enjoyable and unforgettable.They had a high level of professionalism and were well-organised since our touch down in Kathmandu. At the airport we were met by who was to be out guide to EBC and back (friendly and patient Sujan Khanal), and INT organised a taxi straight to our hotel (hotel also organised by INT). The following day we were met by the organiser (Paras Khanal) of the feel in person, who gave us a run down of itinerary and answered our many questions so patiently! On that note, Paras was very accomodating with creating an itinerary specifically tailored to our needs - this was a huge plus, as we didn't have the time to do the trek they initially recommended. paras was very willing to tailor a trek to suit some of our limitations. INT also made some of those admin and difficult parts of travelling in a new city MUCH easier - they organised all taxi transfers around the City, as we needed, the organised the down jackets, down sleeping bags and duffel bags that would be incredibly necessarily in the colder parts of the trek! They also facilitated some sight-seeing around Kathmandu and a provided 2 really enjoyable dinners - a welcome dinner on arrival to Kathmandu and farewell dinner after our trek. Trekking with our guide and 2 porters was a great experienxe in the mountains - we were looked after, entertained, informed and a bit spoilt at times (that extra cup of coffee or opportunity to have a quick and hot shower when you thought it wasn't possible!). This really made the (at times difficult) trek that much more enjoyable. We are very grateful to Sujan our guide and our 2 porters for all the effort they put in on this trek. They are incredibly tough and resilient to the Himalayan cold!It was a relief throughout the trek not to have to fuss with payment for every meal and every room etc - these expenses were all included in the total cost we paid INT - and it was well worth it! Very reasonable price and we more than got our money's worth. Definitely contact Paras and INT for quotes.The trekl itself is amazing but I figure you probably know that already and more likely, you're trying to decide which trekking company to choose. I would highly recommend Imperial Nepal Treks!"
My favourite holiday,"I have done treks all over the world including Patagonia, New Zealand, Peru, Vietnam, Thailand, Tasmania, Switzerland, France and elsewhere in Nepal and I believe this is the ultimate trek especially if you do the three passes.I have done the trek 6 times always in the late October to mid December period. I have never had anything other than perfect clear days on the early stages of the days for the passes and lookouts that include Kalar Pattar, Gokyo Ri, Chukkung Ri, Kongma La, Cho La and Renjo La. I have always done it without porters or guides except for my first trip. Everyone is different but I like the independence and freedom to decide my own itinerary and lodges and the challenge of carrying my own pack. This trek doesn't have the variety of landscape and ethnic groups that Annapurna trekking or Manaslu trekking provides  but if you like mountains and trekking above the tree line for significant periods then nothing beats this trek.I will give a summary of the daily stops I have done in the last couple of treks which avoid  the bulk of the tour groups and make the best of the views. I generally take Diamox from sea level and carry a cheap pulse oximeter to aid and monitor acclimatisation.If you are reasonably fit and are aware of your acclimatisation history then after taking the plane from Kathmandu to Lukla it takes 6-7 hours to get to Namche. I leave my return ticket at the Khumbu resort near the airport so they can arrange the return flight before I arrive back in Lukla. I would call them the night before I return to Lukla so they can arrange the return flight before I arrive in the afternoon. Most people stay in Phakding a few hours from Lukla and then walk to Namche the second day but if you are able to go immediately to 3500m and walk the last two hours up steeply around 600m then you will already be in the mountain view area.I then have an acclimatisation day in the Namche area. I like to climb up to Syanboche and walk to the Everest view Hotel which has a great view of Everest, Lhotse and Ama Dablam and the path ahead. A bare patch of grass to the right hand side of the hotel has clear views if you don't want to go inside the hotel where you will be pressured into buying tea or food. I then walk down to Khumjung and Khunde and walk through the old villages and have lunch. I then walk back to Namche via Syanboche village which aids acclimatisation as you are at around 4000m during the day. Walking higher than you sleep is a great way to acclimatise.  I stay at the Khumbu resort in Namche.  The next day most groups walk to Tengboche but apart from the beautiful Monastery i find the lodges too crowded so I walk up to Mong La at 3950m where there are great views of Ama Dablam and up the valley towards Gokyo and Cho oyu. I stayed at the modern Hilltop Sherpa Lodge which is run by a family unlike the lodges in Tengboche which are run by seasonal workers. I then walk down to Phortse Tenga and up to Phortse before taking the spectacular high path to Upper Pangboche where you can have lunch. There are great views of Ama Dablam from here. I generally go through to Pheriche at 4200m and stay at the Himalayan Hotel which has a great dining room with table cloths, hot towels and a nice central fireplace.In the morning I walk up the steep slope adjacent to Pheriche called Sonam Ri which offers great views of Island Peak, Makalu, Ama Dablam and from higher up Pumori and Everest. Ask the lodge owner how to best go up the steep slope but you should be able to go back for lunch.I stay for the Himalayan Rescue Association lecture at 3pm in the Medical centre and then walk the 45 minutes to Dingboche at 4400m to stay the night.The next day I walk up to Chukkung at 4750m and take a room at one of the lodges and have an early lunch and then go up as far as possible to Chukkung Ri. Even if you don't make the top the views of the glacial systems and mountains on the way up are spectacular and the acclimatisation is invaluable. For those who do the KongMa La pass the next day you should arrange to trek with another trekker or arrange a porter/guide for the trip to the pass if you don't feel comfortable doing it alone. Most lodges will have a friend or relative who will be keen to be a porter/guide for the half day or day for a small fee.It is a long day so attempt to leave at around 6.30am at the latest.  Have a big breakfast and take sandwiches and boiled eggs, biscuits  and chocolate as there are no villages until Lobuche at 4950m. After the pass the next hour is down on steep scree and the last hour before Lobuche is negotiating the glacier so it is a tough day.The next day is a short trek of 90 mins to 2 hours to Gorak Shep at 5100m. I would check in and drop your pack and then walk the 2 hours to Everest base camp at 5300m.Come back for a late lunch and mid afternoon if you are feeling energetic walk up to Kalar Pattar for late afternoon and sunset. It should take 90 mins to 2 hours to get up to the top at 5500m. Brilliant views. Make sure you have your torch for the 45 min walk back down to the hotel.In the morning you can go back up to Kalar Pattar for the early morning perfect views of Everest. I would have lunch at Lobuche and for those doing Chola pass the walk to Dzonghla to stay the night should take 2-3 hours. Cho la is not as long as Kongma La but you have to negotiate the ice glacier before the pass so once again try to team up with another trekker or arrange a porter/guide to the pass if you are wary of doing it alone. You should be able to make Dragnag by late lunch and then negotiate the glacier across to Gokyo in another couple of hours. I stay at the Gokyo resort for the fine variety and quality of food.The next morning I go up to Gokyo Ri which takes about 2 hours as now you will be very  fit. It rivals the views of Kalar Pattar. After the 45 min walk down have an early lunch and then walk 2 hours to the 5th lake for the great views of the glacier and Everest. If you walk up the scree slope on the left hand side for 20 minutes the view is spectacular.The next day you can do the Renjo La which I think gives the best mountain views of all the passes and is the easiest and lowest of the passes to negotiate. Also the path down from the pass includes a paved path for 30 minutes. You should be able to have lunch in Maralung and walk down to Thame in this other worldly valley. You won't see many tourists in this area until Thame. The next day you can walk to Lukla in 7-8  hours via Namche or if you want two days to return to Lukla it is only 2-3 hours to Namche. Make sure you call the Khumbu Resort in Lukla to arrange your return flight date the day before.This is a magnificent trek and if you complete this itinerary you will have seen all the best mountain views and missed most of the tour groups."
Everest Base Camp with Imperial Nepal Treks,"Our group of 6 (4 from Florida and 2 from New Jersey) travelled to Nepal to trek the Himalayas.  After a lot of research, we decided to go with Imperial Nepal Treks.  Paras Khanal (one of the owners) was very prompt in answering any questions we had about the trip.   This was comforting since 3 of the group had never travelled to that side of the world.  All questions were answered satisfactorily, payments were clearly stated, inclusions and exclusions were as stated... no surprises (just a few pleasant one)!Upon arrival to Kathmadu, we were met by Sujan, who was also our guide on the trek.  We were whisked away to the hotel without any issues.  The Apsara hotel was no Ritz, but it had all the creature comforts: clean sheets, hot water, bottled water, in-room amenities for coffee and tea.  Breakfast was included and was very good.  After a recovery day in Kathmadu, we were off to Lukla.  Unfortunately, our airline's plane was stuck in bad weather, and although the weather in Kathmandu and Lukla was fine, we could not get out.  Finally, after 5 long hours at the airport, Paras and Sujan arranged for helicopter to take us to Lukla.  Although we would have liked to have been on the trek early, the chopper ride was a great unexpected and pleasant surprise.From Lukla, Sujan and our 4 porters were the perfect complement to our journey.  They were there when you needed them, and not when you did not.  One of our group got sick on the way, and Sujan made sure that someone stayed with her all the time.  The rest of us continued on at our pace, and she did the best she could at her pace.  Ultimately, she caught up with us (on one of our acclimatization days.  Each night we had briefings about what to expect the next day and the briefings were pretty much right on.  During the hike, when we were curious as to what to expect from the next section of the trail, or how far the next destination was, again, they were spot on!  At the tea houses, the guys made sure we well fed and watered.  They would watch each one of group for obvious (or not-so-obvious) signs of trouble.  There was plenty of flexibility in the trek... we were somewhat faster than the average group, so we were able to change or destination for the night on the fly.  This was great because we did not really want to hike only 3-4 hours on the way back, and spend all day in the hotel lounge.  Instead, we chose to hike 7-8 hours and were able to shave off a day and get back to Kathmandu earlier than planned.  This was important because the Lukla weather is pretty unpredictable, and it gave us and additional day to get out.  Since we had plans to visit New Delhi, we really needed to get out of Lukla on time.  Again, Paras and Sujan came through for us, and all our plans came through as planned.I would rate this hike as one of the more difficult hikes I have done (I only have Macchu Picchu and Kilimanjaro to compare).  However, the scenery, the culture, the kindness of the people was simply incredible.  We went mid September because it was the tail end of the monsoon season.  We knew we might hit some foggy days (which we did), but we also knew that the trail would not be horribly crowded (which it was not).  The first few days were foggy, we had some rain, but those days hold a beauty of their own,  The last 3 days of the climb were clear, sunny and revealed the Himalayan peaks in all their glory.  The trek back was also absolutely beautiful.  The day we got to base camp was a whiteout... we could not even see the Khumbu glacier or ice fall from base camp.  However, the very next day, we climbed Kala Patthar (`18,500 ft).  Even though the morning started it off foggy, the sun burnt right through the fog, and we got some glorious views of Everest!I have been asked by friends if I would do this trek again.  I am grateful that I was able to do this trek... and so grateful that we got to see and experience the sights, sounds and the culture of the Himalayas.  I guess there are so many other incredible places in the world, I would love to see what else is out there.  However, I would not trade this experience and would strongly recommend the trek to anyone who is considering it!"
A Sight of EBC Trip to be Marvelled at...,"Through this trip,we have experienced the literal meaning of the greatest Chinese saying 一山还比一山高. One mountain is higher than another.There are never ending peaks to be conquered, not to mentioned the final destination of our EBC trip is only the foot of the breathtaking Mountain Everest. Take a breath of relief at the top of the mountain that we have just summit,there is another higher one waiting for us. As demoralising as it may sounds,the adventurous hikes challenged our persistence and makes us a stronger person each day. As we climbed, there are variation of landscape and mountain scenery to be seen and experienced. From monasteries visits,valley walks,  watching sherpas doing their routines, encounters the mountain goats and especially hoping in between the fresh yak dung ,12 days on the mountains has broaden my views and perspectives on mountain living. We were surprised how a 14 years old little girl with petite body are able to carry our baggages up to 50 kg. Looking at how tough their life can be,we wish we could have pack lesser.Having said so, the weather in the night time is too unbearable to pack lesser. We learned that the dzo which are physically less fluffy than the yak and more fluffy than the cow are hybrid between the yak and cow for the benefit of milk production. As there are needed as pack animals to carry goods to provide for the locals and visitors, there are seen to be on the trail as the trekkers. When walking through the herds of yaks,dzo and cows ,we were cautioned to on guard at all times. We lost count on how many times we stepped onto the the yak's dung. The most bizarre encounter was we were sitting comfortable next to the fire place where the yak dung were used as burning fuel.Looking at the stunning peak view of Amadablam, we quickly forget the disappointment when we had to wait at the airport for 3 days before the weather permitted us to fly.The desperate feeling in every team member's facial expression resorted us to book the helicopter. We were glad that we made it to Lukla on the 3rd day without having to fly with the helicopter. Later when we descend,we met a group of Taiwanese trekker whom shared with us that helicopter maybe more economical resolution as we could save on our working leaves and the expenses incur for the stays during the descents.Days are filled with trekking under the harsh sun and windblown up to the last day of the trip. Being able to complete this trek with enjoyment and able to acclimatise to the elevation is my personal sense of achievement. I strive to continue to conquer more mountains as long I am fit. Thsi trip is a motivation for me to accomplish more bucket list items.I would say this trek is suitable for people for people from all walks of life with average fitness as long as you keep your pace slow and steady. Time is not of the essence during the trek."
Great Trek (even with less than ideal weather),"This was my first trek and I really enjoyed it. Although challenging, it is doable for a moderate hiker and decent physical condition. There was an extended monsoon season, which meant it was raining or snowing nearly every day and views were often obstructed by low clouds. Nonetheless, we had a great time. For the most part, the trek isn't overly steep but don't underestimate the altitude. I went with a company that had a very conservative acclimatization schedule, which I think contributed to my success in reaching base camp. We spent three days in Namche on the way up. The paths are dirt and rocky so watch your step. If at all possible, get your shoes in plenty of time to try them out in all types of weather. For me, I do not live in an area that receives much snow so I had to hope for the best. After a heavy snow the day before, the rocks leading into base camp were very slick and I basically slid into base camp. It was NOT fun. Base camp itself was barren at the time I went (there weren't any expeditions there that I saw), but it was awesome just the same. I've never been so glad to see prayer flags in my life. The Khumbu Icefall is all you have ever imagined and more. You cannot see Everest from base camp, but trust me, you will not care! The views are stunning and the surrounding mountains tower above.A note about training: Be sure to work on your cardio, especially 3 months out. The hiking itself isn't so difficult but the altitude will keep your body working hard. You also want to be sure that you are able to walk for long periods of time since some days on the way back especially you will probably be hiking for 10+ miles for at least 3 days straight. The stronger a hiker you are, the better.  If you're training where there are few hills, work to carry 25 lbs in your pack on all your hikes. You won't carry that much when you're actually on the trek if you have porters but you'll be glad you did since it gets you accustomed to the physical requirements that altitude brings. Also, get used to drinking lots of water...minimum of 5 liters a day at altitude. Also, be sure to bring your favorite energy bars and treats. I completely lost my appetite after Namche Bazaar and was glad I had protein bars that provided lots of nutrition in a small portion."
I've been there 5 times and can't get enough of those mountains,Such a special place in the planet. A must go if you appreciate nature and its wonders. For sure one of the most beautiful trekking I have ever done: Lukla to Everest Base Camp in spring time. Allow 9 - 10 days for you do it properly and acclimatizing to altitude
BREATHTAKING trek over 11 days.....,"From start to finish this was unbelievable for us. We were delayed at the start due to weather conditions. Which we didn't mind as we didn't have time restrictions. Please note don't leave too little time either side of your trek as it can get delayed. Once we had the all clear to fly the flight in itself was amazing, seeing the Himalayas from the plane window (small Plane) was breathtaking. The landing in Lukla was out of this world, the airport is insane..... The trek was hard work but worth every step.... The views, scenery, small settlements pulled us through. Once we reach EBC its was fantastic. The base camp itself was occupied by hopeful climbers wanting to reach the summit. We would walk and talk with them on the trails everyday. Which was an experience itself. Some had trained and saved for a lifetime to do it. sharing the trails with Yaks, farmers, hikers, guides and locals was all part of it from start to the finish. The trek back to Lukla was just as hard as going to EBC. Make sure you hire a good guide/company as they will keep you healthy and make sure you eat the right food. Don't get ill up there..... we used Himalayan Wonders who were fantastic. I would recommend this trip to anyone. Attitude can play a big part of succeeding or not, just take your time and you'll be fine, no more than 600 metres ascending per day..... Enjoy the natural beauty of NEPAL"
Amazing views of Everest while trekking to Ama Dablam base camp,"This October my friend and I had an amazing experience trekking to Ama Dablam base camp with Himalayan Glacier (trekking). Himalayan Glacier organized a private luxury lodges tour for us from Lukla through Namche, Thame, Khumjung, Portse and Pangboche to Ama Dablam base camp and, of course, back. The amazing experience was enhanced by fantastic weather and the best guide we've trekked with - Gadul Tamang. Gadul was always very friendly, kind and attentive. The company, Himalayan Glacier was very responsive when booking the trip. They tailored the trip to our time schedule, preferences and style. For most of the trek we followed the typical Everest Base Camp trek, or Everest Luxury Lodges/View trek. Except, we did not go all the way to base camp but rather visited Ama Dablam Base camp from Pangboche and trekked back. We added Thame to the itinerary. We loved visiting Thame. It is not often on the typical Everest BC trek. We highly recommend this addition. One of the most charming Sherpa villages. Along the trek, from Namche, thru Portse and Pangboche and on the way to Ama Dablam BC we had amazing views of Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Char, Nuptse and Ama Dablam itself. We highly recommend this 11 day itinerary and the luxury lodges. The views are spectacular. The lodges we used were the Yeti Montain lodges and the Everest Summit Lodges. We also highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and Gadul Tamang. They provided outstanding service and a most memorable experience. We loved our trek and time In the Everest region. We'll definitely return again."
Everest Base Camp Trek without a guide,"Everest Base Camp Trek: Without A GuideA Day By Day Account of hiking the EBC without a guideTook me 9 days to reach EBC and only 3 days to get back. Not to bad for a first timer without a guide. What it’s really like to Trek to Everest Base Camp without a guide or porterIn March 2016, I trekked Everest Base Camp without a guide or a porter. With that said, I’m just a Tennessee country boy that normally takes risks in life and it’s important to note that my blog isn’t intended to take away the valuable resources that Sherpa’s and Porters offer. For one they are safer, share valuable knowledge, alleviate stress, and depend on the income. I personally chose to trek without them because I felt having someone carrying my supplies and leading me the way wouldn’t be as rewarding once I reached Everest Base Camp. My blog also isn’t to endorse or promote certain businesses. It’s strictly the places I visited and stayed on a day by day account and worked for me.It’s important to note that hiking to Everest Base Camp isn’t impossible but it helps to be in shape otherwise you won’t be able to enjoy your trip. I did see and hear of many people that couldn’t complete the trek. My background consists of being an endurance athlete and a novice hiker. I grew up near the Smoky Mountains where I’m used to hiking but the highest elevation there is only 6,600 feet. So I didn’t have any experience with higher altitude before doing Everest Base Camp. The trick is to take your time and not do too much too soon. It’s all about pacing yourself and staying hydrated. I’m 36 and 175lbs and would drink about 3-4 liters of water a day. It’s also important to take “rest days” so you have time to acclimatize. I chose to do the trek in March so I didn’t have to worry about huge groups on the trail or about not getting a room at the lodges, also called “tea houses”. I also did this month because it's my birthday and wanted to experience something awesome on my birthday! The weather was decent and it only rained once at mid day. It did snow on day 9 at Everest Base Camp but it made the scenery that much nicer.  While hiking to Everest Base Camp, I jotted down notes in my journal describing  each day of the trek. The intent is to show you how much hiking you do each day so that you can decide if it’s right for you. This is personal day-day account and will vary per person. At no time did I ever have an issue finding a room at a lodge “tea house” or did I have safety issues. I made no reservations and just walked through the villages until I found a tea house I liked. The good thing about the first two weeks of March is it not being over crowded. Another issue I worried about was getting lost but there were always villages or small town with a couple of hours of trekking so you if you felt lost you could always ask some one. There is also only one main path to follow and signs or little white marks to follow to let you know you are on the trail. Everyone is super nice and helpful. Only a couple of times I ran into someone that didn’t understand English but they understood the village I was trying to get to or I just showed them the map. You must have a map with you and I bought mine in Kathmandu in one of the tourist shops. They are everywhere. Just buy one that is waterproof.  Trust me, if they can understand my southern accent and mispronunciation of the names then they can understand you. There is also plenty of water and food in the villages to buy and at no time did I ever run out or low on water of food. Just make sure to covert your money because not all places would take the all mighty US Dollar. Day 1: Fly from Kathmunda to Lukla, then hike to Phakding (2530m), ~ 2.5 hours of hiking. Left Saturday March 5th 2016. Checked out of Hotel Friends Home in Kathmandu. Very nice Hotel with a good breakfast and friendly staff. They have a free taxi to pick you up at airport but you have to pay $6 US Dollars for ride back. I took the 6:45am flight via Tara Airlines from Kathmandu to Lukla Airport because flights get delayed constantly due to severe weather. Airport doesn’t open until 5:30am so no need to get there any earlier. Bags have to be under 10kg. Mine was 10.4 kg and they overlooked it. There are only 2 gates and they both led outside to the planes. Our plane was delayed about 45 minutes but once we boarded the small two engine (20 passenger) plane we took off in 10 minutes. The flight was surprising smooth until the last 15 minutes and then you basically make a nose dive into Lukla. Remember this is one of the most dangerous airports in the World. Travel tip:  Sit on the left side of the plane for spectacular view of the mountains. It’s amazing how close to the mountains we fly! The flight took about 40 minutes and the temperature in Lukla was around 30 degrees. Lukla is the tiniest airport I’ve been too and you literally get off the plane and your luggage is in a cart and you grab and go while you are still outside. I did notice porters lined up at the airport looking to be hired but I just followed the trail as there is only one way to go and that is thru the small village. There are a few places to eat breakfast and a lot of places to stay. After eating breakfast and buying water for around $5.00, I headed out of town towards Phakding. This was a 4 mile hike (2.5 hours of mostly down hill with some up hill of the last 45 minutes), nothing too strenuous. Trail can be very muddy and rocky at times. This will be the easiest day you have. I saw a lot of mules and Yaks on the trail so make sure you stay away from the cliff as they pass you. People have been known to be pushed off the cliffs. In Phakding, I stayed at Namastay Lodge. The cost is $2.00 per night per room and $5.00 if you want a shower. Very nice staff and food is good. I ordered tuna pizza for $5.00 and was actually good considering most of us would never eat that in Tennesssee. We are used to Rabbit and Squirrel on our pizza. haha jk. You can also buy 1 liter bottled for $1.50.Day 2: (Sunday March 6th) Hike from Phakding (2530m) to Namche (3440m), 4-5 hours of hiking. Temp. 30 degrees. Woke up this morning at 7am and ate eggs and veggies. Beautiful day to hike because the skies were clear and blue. Refilled water bottles for 5o cents each. Hike was easy starting out until we passed the last village at Everest River Restaurant and then there is an elevation gain. It’s very steep and I had to stop several times to rest. You then come to the famous high suspension bridges (in the movie Everest) and it’s exhilarating – especially if it’s windy. After the bridge you have a even steeper climb for the next 1.5 miles. I ended up having a pounding headache for the last 45 minutes of the climb and where I started experiencing altitude sickness. At the top of the trail you come to a police check point to show them your permit. From here it was only 20 minutes to Namche. It was a beautiful hike as you cross many bridges, see many mules and yaks, but was challenging. I stayed at the Tibet Lodge which was $1.00 per night. My head was hurting pretty bad so I laid down to rest for a couple of hours. I ended up getting chills and felt very weak. I forced myself to  drink some coffee (for the caffenine) to help my headache and eat some food. I spoke to a Doctor that was staying there and recommended me go back down to lower elevation if my symptoms got worse.Day 3: (Monday March 7th) My Birthday!! Rest Day (Acclimatization Day) in Namche.     I woke up at 6am and had my headache all night. I had a veggie omelet for $3.50, coffee and water. After breakfast I made myself do a short hike. One thing you quickly learn about rest days, is that they’re not rest days at all.  They’re a chance for your body to adjust to the altitude and follow the advice hike high, sleep low, meaning you hike to a higher elevation, then return to sleep at a lower one. I did a 2 hour hike up with ~300m of elevation to Hotel Everest View, a lodge where I had some tea and as the name indicates, a view of Everest.  Ironically it’s one of the few places along the trail that you can actually see Everest. Even though I didn’t feel well, seeing Everest for the first time perked me up and it being my birthday made it that much better!  I stayed on the deck at Hotel Everest View for about an hour taking the view all in. It was breathtaking and everything I had imagined. Beautiful blue skies and temperature was 40. Couldn’t ask for a better day!Day 4: (Tuesday March 8th) Namche (3440m) to Timboche (3770m) 4.5 hours of hiking Checked out of hotel and left at 7am. First 15 minutes is up hill and next 30 minutes is level. Next 90 minutes is rolling hills. I recommend resting/eating at the last restaurant in the village after the bridge because it’s a 1,000 meter climb and takes about 1 hour 45 min to do. The terrain is very sandy and not much rocks.  There is a beautiful monastery that if you’re lucky you’ll be able to enter. I was able to enter at 7am. No pictures are allowed inside and you have to take shoes off before entering. It’s beautiful inside with a huge statue of Budha. I checked in at the Himalaya Lodge for $1.00 a room. This is a small village with not many places to stay but there is a Bakery that has apple pie, brownies, and cinnamon rolls.Day 5: (Wednesday March 9th) Timboche (3770m) to Dingboche (4360m), 4.5-5 hours of hiking. Temperature was around 20 degrees. Left at 8:30am so the sun would help warm up the area. Hiked for one hour downhill and came to a bridge. After the bridge we had a 20 min steep hike where I saw goats and deer. Once up the hill you follow the river most of the way with rolling hills. You pass one village on the way and after that there is an open valley with rocks for the next 90min-2hours. Make sure and have plenty of water. I checked in at Hotel Bright Star located at the end of town. It was also $1.00 a room. There is a good Bakery at the beginning of town with excellent apple pie for around $5.00. Prices start to increase since we are at higher elevations now. Water gets more expensive. A lot of people were getting altitude sickness at the hotel. At dinner I ate spaghetti and yak cheese. The only bad thing about this hotel is it’s located on the main path so it’s very noisey with yaks and mules with bells on them so don’t plan on sleeping in past 6am.Day 6: (Thursday March 10th) Rest Day  “Acclimatization Day” in Dingboche. Woke up this morning with loud hammering at 6am and didn’t sleep well due to my head ache being back. Feels colder this morning and I’m guessing temps are in teens. I stayed in room #103 which has a beautiful view of Mount Everest. The view is absolutely gorgeous as it had snowed the night before and there was snow-covered views of the entire valley! I ate breakfast and went out for about an hour hike but my head was hurting so bad that I had to turn around.Day 7: (Friday March 11th) Dingboche (4360m) to Lobuche (4930m), ~ 4 hours of hiking. Today I woke up feeling much better. The first 15 minutes is up hill out of the village but then levels out for the next 90 minutes until you come to a bridge. I rested for 15 minutes because there is a steep rocky climb for the next 60 minutes. At the top of the ridge I came to the memorials of all those who died on Mt. Everest including Scott Fischer. If you have seen the movie Everest then you will know who he is. It was an uneasy feeling and very windy. From here it’s very flat and only 30 minutes to Lobuche. I stayed at Sherpa Lodge and there are about 4 other places also. Food and water prices keep increases. Water is now around $3.00. Day 8: (Saturday March 12th) Lobuche (4930) to Gorak Shep (5288) 3 hours of trekking.  The hike took 3 hours. The first 30 minutes is up hill and then levels out for next hour. The rest of the trek is rolling hills. Nothing but rocks and gravel. The view is spectacular as you see nothing but mountains, glaciers, and snow. I stopped at Gorak Shep to check in at a the lodge and to rest a little. It was at this time I felt really sick from the altitude but had to push on because Base Camp was just a couple of hours away. I used this as motivation and pushed on. The temperature dropped at this elevation so I had to bundle up. It was now in the lower teens. The trail can be hard to follow at this point but I just followed another group. If not for them I would have gotten lost as you climb over rocks and there is no clear path. As I got closer, the anticipation grew with each step. Finally, yellow specks appeared on the horizon, which was about 4 or 5 yellow tents sent up at Base Camp.  Upon arriving, the mood was celebratory! I finally made it to Everest Base Camp!  Unfortunately, due to the sickness, I felt weak, exhausted, and had a pounding headache but still took the moment in. After about 30 minutes, I couldn’t stay long because a storm was coming and a local guide told everyone he recommended everyone to leave but I wish I could have stayed longer. On the way back, I felt even worse and took all my energy to make it to the lodge. It took me about 90 minutes but felt like 3 hours.Day 9:  (Sunday March 13th) Gorak Shep (5288) to Dingbouche (4330m),  4.5 hours of trekking.  Woke up this morning with snow on the ground and temperature was very cold. This was the day I had to decide whether to hike up to Kala Pattar (5548), which offers the best views of Mount Everest. But given my weakened condition and difficulty in breathing I decided to save my energy for the trek back. Took me less than 2 hours to trek down to Lobuche and another hour to reach the Memorials where Scott Fischer is. I stopped at the bottom of the ridge to rest at the restaurant and eat. I trekked another 90 minutes to Dingboche which is mostly downhill and flat but very rocky and muddy. I checked in at Himalaya Lodge and was $1.00 a night.Day 10: (Monday March 14th) Dingbouche (433m) to Namache (3550m), 6.5-7 hours of trekking.  I was still feeling bad and slept terrible. Woke up every other hour. Tried ordering breakfast but never saw any staff members. I had to end up leaving money with a note attached at the front desk. I walked to another lodge and ordered breakfast with them. As I descending to the lower altitudes I noticed I was felling better and my pace was quickening. Took me under 2 hours to trek to Phonocha. Easy hike for the first 15 minutes and then have a steep hill. Flattens out for the next 90 minutes and you reach Deboche. Have a steep climb for about an hour before reaching Tynboche. Stopped at bakery to rest and eat a brownie! Trekked another 60 minutes down a steep hill and then up a steep hill for 30 minutes. This would terrain would repeat until I reached Namache.Day 11: Namache (3550m) to Lukla (3440m)Woke up this morning feeling great! My headache was finally gone and I felt like my energy was back! Today was the last day of trekking and time to head back to Lukla. I still had a 5 hour hike but nothing new. The weather is beautiful but I knew that it was supposed to rain later on so I left early to beat the rain. I followed the same trail I came on. The terrain was much easier going back to Phakding. I stopped at Namaste Lodge, where I had spent the first night. I had lunch and rest for about 60 minutes. From here back to lukla it’s a steep hike, so get ready! My motivation was knowing that the finish line was on the other side of the mountain. I can’t exactly remember how long it was as I forgot to log this in my journal. I’m thinking it took around 2 hours? I remember being about 15 minutes away and then it started pouring the rain. I had gone 11 days with no rain so I picked up my pace and made it to the tea house. I made it around 3pm. My flight was the next morning at 8am. I recommend getting the first flight due to possible weather delays. The small airport gets very crowded so try to get there early. Arriving back in Lukla after 11 days of hiking.I had done it!  I had  finished the Everest Base Camp trek!"
Everest base camp trek,"Walking from Lukla to Everest Base Camp and return.  Accommodation in lodges, breakfast included.  Traveled with Himalayan Social Journey (group of 10) out of Kathmandu, 18 day trip from Australia.  A good company and especially the lead guide, Gunga, who couldn't do enough for us.  A late monsoon meant weather wasn't always good but a great trip for anyone with reasonable walking fitness."
Everest with my own eyes,"Cannot explain how emotional it is to see Everest while in Tibet. I am a mountain lover, wish I was younger and I would want to explore the Himalayas higher than my current altitude of 5649m"
Yeti Airlines Everest Express is ALL THAT!,"Following the sage advice from others, we arrived early for our Mount Everest fly-by. We were booked on the 2nd flight of the day. While we waited for the weather report from the first flight, it started raining heavily at the airport. No worries, the mountain was clear! We took off on schedule and once we broke through the clouds, the scenery was beautiful! The group on the left side of the plane got to see the mountain first, then all passengers were allowed a quick trip to the cockpit for picture taking and then the right side passengers got the fly-by.The flight attendant was lovely and patiently pointed out the different mountains, made sure we all got pictures and served champagne as we flew back to the airport. We couldn't ask for a better tour."
Magical,"You never forget your first view of Everest. Mine was as I trudged alongside my guide on the trail as we left Namche. If you have a bucket list, this has to be on it in some form. The scenery is beautiful, the area is totally worth every ounce of effort it takes to get there. If you are flying in through Lukla Airport, you can hire a hire porter straight away to help you with your bags or backpack if you want to make the climb more manageable. Most people follow the EBC trail for many days as they slowly acclimatise, so take your time and enjoy the most stunning place on earth."
AMAZING TREK!!,"Had a lovely evening stroll up her last Sunday, was a bit chilly on top. I reccomend taking a few layers as it can get a little cool on top. Not many facilitys on top, It would benefit from a nice cafe where you could have a cup of tea and a scone and jam. All in all the it was a lovely experience. Additional, fantastic for sledging, so make sure you take your sledge with you."
Big mountain,"Its a mountain, the biggest in the world (although not the closest to space!) worth a look I suppose."
Amazing Views,This place on of the scenic mountain views. place in the world. when you are this place you thought i am different planet. you should visit once your life.
Nothing like the top of the world,There is absolutely nothing in this world better that looking the top of the world. Mount Everest hardly fails to astonish you.
Excellent Views,"I've always wanted to climb Everest since I was a child. With the expense I never thought I would even get as close as Base Camp, but I did. I hiked to base camp in April 2016. I did it in 7 days up and 2 days down. I don't recommend the 2 days down and actually if I were to suggest this to someone with some time limitations, I would say 8-9 days up and 3-4 days down. This was a self-guided trek. I went with two other people; a friend and her friend. Pre-requirements should be that you are generally fit and have hiking experience. Make sure that you have cold weather gear, a warm sleeping bag, and good hiking boots. Bring along some snacks and water. Bring money for cooked meals along the way and especially for breakfast and dinner. You'll first fly into Lukla, which by the way get ready for some delays. Most planes seemed to be delayed several hours in and a couple out. Sometimes they were canceled all together. The pilots have to fly by sight and can't use the instruments for safety reasons. So poor visibility due to pollution, fires, or weather may mean a delay in getting in or out.Once you reach Lukla the trek begins. But, before you leave Lukla stop at a hotel and reserve a room for your return. Also, give them your flight info and ask them to check you in to your flight. This has to be done by 4 or 5p the night before and if for some reason you aren't back yet they won't let you fly out. Then begin the trek. Make sure you acclimatize in Namche and then again likely at Dingboche. There are some great day hikes to take on those days. Once you're at Gorak Shep do climb up to Kalapatthar. It is less than a mile up, but I was rocking it and it took me 1.5 hours to climb it. I was also carrying camera gear, but still!We came down in two days as I've said. That was fast, but I really wouldn't recommend it. We pushed to get down and it made for long days of hiking. Totally doable, but not necessary. The pictures don't really capture the fantastic views. I would suggest that you check it out yourself and you don't need a guide."
"Stunning nature, fascinating culture","Many things are written and said about Mt Everest and the region. To me it remains the most spectacular mountain scenery in the world combined with a very fascinating Sherpa culture. I have been there several times in the last 20 years, it remains a fabulous area..."
Great Mountain!,"It is great Himalayas of the world. I have been to this region by trekking and it is wonderful trek experience. I took 10 days trek to Everest. My trek was organized from Nepal Vision Treks and it was perfect. My Guide, Lok and porter bisnu both were fantastic, they look after me very well. Lok is very professional and he always ensured me personalized services.I would recommend every active person to do this trek and obviously recommend Nepal Vision Treks for this experience.Miss. Surin"
Amazing Everest base camp trek,My girlfriend and I went to Everest base camp in Oct 2014. It was one of the best memories we had so far. We enjoyed the high snow-capped mountain views and Sherpa culture. It was truly an amazing experience.
Amazing 13 day adventure!,"We were a group of 10  people who did the Base Camp trek with Nepal Adventure Point Ltd.  Our two guides Padam Bhandari and Narayan Bhandari were amazing and made the whole challenge more manageable and achievable due to their expertise, patience and caring attitude. The tea-houses they chose at each rest point where great; clean and very good hospitality. Apart from a heater in the main dining area, the remainder of the buildings are not heated so whatever the temperature is outside, it will be the same in your bedroom and the communal bathroom!This was my first ever trek and although I had trained for over 9 months to prepare for this trip, nothing prepares you for the initial trek from Phakding to Namche Bazaar. There are just thousands of steps hued into the mountain side, some of which are at knee height.  If you are like me a (relative) novice walker, trekking poles and a really sturdy, comfortable pair of walking boots are a godsend and a must. I was the only one who took Diamox to alleviate the symptoms of altitude sickness.  To be fair I only suffered on the descent back from Base Camp to Pheriche when I thought my head was going to explode but I was able to sleep it off.  Others in my group had to be airlifted back to Kathmandu and various stages of the ascent/descent so in the end only 4 of us completed the full trek to EBC and back to Lukla, myself included :-)It is without doubt the most challenging thing I have ever attempted and I probably wouldn't attempt this kind of high altitude trek again but the camaraderie, companionship and kindness through by complete strangers along the route, kept me going and allowed me to finish.  One thing to tick off the bucket list!"
Fantástic,It was wesome be there in the Everest Base Camp. I did the 3 passes trail by myself. It wasnt so hard. But i had to be prepared for the cold and the altitude.
Not For The Fainthearted.,"This trek has been on my agenda for past five years but something or the other kept to stall it. Being an avid trekker this is a challenge I wanted to put myself through and the highest point was completing it successfully without a hint of AMS or other major physical discomfort. My months of training didn't go in vain.Being advanced grade trekking it does require physical and mental preparation. Some reading, following dos' and don'ts. Without that there are often consequences to pay with like falling sick. Meet 5 people on the trail who were forced to turn back mid way or had to be airlifted. Those who don't like crowded trail going on early March is a better idea. It is colder but makes walking easier even with the wind chill factor. Hiring a porter cum guide atleast is a good idea. Several people got lost never to be seen again when they ventured on their own. Plus it a good way to contribute to local economy. Staying connected is very possible even from Gorekshep whether through phone calls or internet. Device charging and drinking (hot) water is expensive, so good idea to keep aside a sum. This wasn't my first time in Nepal and wasn't last time either. Most probably next summer I'll be doing another similar grade trek if shark cage diving doesn't work out."
JUST GO,"There are not words to describe the region. I opted to do a trek from Lukla to Everest Base Camp and back and loved every minute of my trip. The mountains are peaceful, not too crowded and majestic. If you get the chance, make sure you get in a trek in the Everest region to experience the beauty of this area."
Unbelievable Everest Base camp with Imperial Nepal Treks and guide Hari!,"Everest Base Camp 9 days -very short!-with Imperial Nepal Treks was just an amazing adventure. Hari-my guide-did everything to make this trek successful and enjoyable .Actually I did finish even in 8 days.Due to lack of time I was aware of the risk going so fast   with no extra days for acclimatization.The scenary of Himalayas is just out of my mind,so surreal. Accomodation and food was carefully choosen by my guide considering my best needs.Thank you Hari and thank you Imperial Nepal treks for making my dream come true!!"
Everest Base Camp trek,"Really enjoyed the trek. Lukla airport was a real pain the get through because the flights are always delayed due to weather--I lost one day on the flight out to Lukla from Kathmandu, and one day again on the completion of the trek. However, once you get through this, the scenery on the way to the base camp was fantastic. What also fascinated me was the way people like up in the mountains. Nepalese are really hardy people. And despite what fellow trekkers thought of the dhal bhat, it is quite edible if it is served hot. Avoid the chicken though--it is as tough as beef. The only disappointment I had was at the Everest base camp itself. I was expecting to be able to see the Everest peak there but it was not visible--had to trek up Kala Parthar to be able to see Everest peak because there is no line-of-sight from the base camp.I must also add that my guide, Dipak, took really good care of me. I always looked forward to the platter of fruits he prepared after every dinner.So with such an great experience, I will want to go back to Nepal again for another trekking trip."
"We trekked with Sanjib Adhikari from Nepal Planet Day Tours from 15.4.2015 to 28.4.2015. On 4.25.2015, the massive earth","Sanjib picked us up from the airport when our flight arrived 12.4.2015. He took us to our hostel, and visited us again the next morning, taking us to various places to get final provisions prior to our trek. His office is very nice and he served us tea.He picked us up the morning of our flight to Lukla. Upon arrival in Lukla, we met our porter and we had breakfast. The cost of our trek was extraordinarily competitive and everything was included. The only thing I had to pay for was if I wanted something like a candy bar while trekking–and then only if it weren’t a scheduled meal or break. I honestly feel we had the best deal available for this trek in Nepal.Sanjib commands a certain amount of respect from the Nepalese and other guides. He is very tall and in excellent shape. He seems known by everyone on the trail, from the teahouse owners to the other guides to airport personnel. It seemed as if he arranged everything in advance, getting us excellent lodgings in teahouses. Each of our dinners came with pomegranate seeds and tangerines–but no one else in the dining area had these. To this day, I don’t know where Sanjib found this stuff.My travel partner and I are 57 and 53 years old respectively. Sanjib did not push us to make our miles in any amount of time. It was a leisurely pace, although still very difficult. He explained many of the sites and cultures. He knew everything it seemed. His English was good enough where we had absolutely no problems with communication.Sanjib has an excellent sense of humor, and even with the extreme difficulty, I found something to laugh about daily. On the day from Tengboche to Lobuche, I ended up very ill. I couldn’t even carry my pack. I would say this is one of the sickest I’ve ever been. When we reached Lobuche, I immediately laid down under two sleeping bags and two huge wool blankets. I could not get warm. I had no appetite.Shortly after, Sanjib appeared with a bowl of porridge and cup of tea. He very calmly but sternly explained that it was necessary I choke this down if I had to. He left. I choked it down, and within 1/2 an hour, my strength began returning and I started tow arm up. The next day I woke up about 80% of my usual strength, able to continue on to Gorekshep. It wasn’t until later I found out we were headed out in a helicopter the next morning if I woke up in the same condition.On our descent, while in Namche, the earthquake struck. This isn’t a review of the earthquake, so I’ll say no more about that event. Sanjib decided, along with my travel partner (I was overruled) to head out the next morning to Phak Ding. The trek to Phak Ding was treacherous, with earth clearly waiting to slide off the mountain. We reached a landslide area that destroyed the trail, so we had a vertical climb up and around this landslide.The ground we had to climb was very loose and I was fearful it would not hold our weight. Sanjib made steps with his feet, after taking my pack, and assisted me with getting to the top. I was fearful, knowing I left a kid back at home.A half hour after we got off the trail, a 6.9 aftershock occurred. Sanjib had insisted we be off the trail by noon because of “tales” of another earthquake. I told him that was superstition and he should not worry. He said ok, but we need to hurry up and get off the trail. The 6.9 aftershock occurred 12:30.Upon arrival in Lukla, so many people were waiting to get out of the airport and back to Kathmandu. Our flight was cancelled, so we were now at the end of the line of hundreds of trekkers trying to get out. We were looking at that time at a good one week delay. Somehow, and he has not told me how this happened, he got us on the first flight out on the day after we were scheduled to leave.People who trekked the same time as us were stranded for up to two weeks. We were delayed one day. You tell me what kind of pull Sanjib had, to get us out of Lukla only one day later.When we arrived in Kathmandu, our hostel was closed because of damage. Sanjib found us a very good high rise hotel at a very reasonable cost who took us in. He visited us everyday until we left.I owe this guide my sincere thanks for the best trek we’ve ever taken–and we are world trekkers–and for in all likelihood, saving our lives.I cannot wait to again visit Nepal and visit Sanjib Adhikari."
Your looking at the top of the world!,Epic trek!  Bucket list and a place where you have to hike your butt up to! Very high altitude so not for the faint hearted.  You need to be fit.  Worth every step to see this incredibly special place.  You are on a glacier & we were there in climbing season so it was alive with expeditions climbing the mountain.
WOW you are at the top of the world!!,"Wow - I think this is the most spectacular sight to see, best seen from the Tibetan side. Your first glimpse if from the middle of the road, and the road to base camp is bumpy!! The walk is easy enough, and well worth getting up pre-dawn. Stay at the highest monastery in the world, it may not be flash, but its worth the hospitality."
“Amazing experience!”,It was our second  trip to Nepal and we (Me & my wife) had a lifetime experience with Regulus Treks& Expedition.The Nepalese  people are amazing and make the trip extra memorable.our trek everest bace camp trek  amazing and our life time story  of the  everest bace camp trekking and thank you regulus team ...................................
Trek to Everest Base Camp,"Myself and my son trekked to EBC in April 2015. WE had signed up with Adventure Nepal Eco Treks owned by Mr.Devi Baral who were excellent throughout. We had a couple of nights in Devi's Hotel Holiday House which was also first class. We still had the majority of our trekking gear to buy and Devi got us sorted. On our 2nd day we met our guide Arjun who inturn helped us with our packing,phones and everything else we needed. Arjun was the complete professional who was a wealth of knowledge and who put my mind at ease as i was slightly nervous at what lay ahead. Kathmandu itself is a complete shock to the system as we had never been to an Asian city, so our adventure began the minute we were picked up from the airport. We were launched into a traffic system that can only be described as mayhem. You are met by a wall of noise, dust,colours buses that seem to have 100's crammed in and the horns never stop. It's an amazing place. We left early on our 3rd morning for the Airport and again Arjun handled everything expertly. The domestic departures is another experience in itself. There doesn't seem to be much of a system in evidence apart from who shouts the loudest. Seats are a premium on the small 16 seater planes as there can be alot of last minute cancellations as the weather can change so quickly in the mountains. Arjun secured us our seats and we headed for Lukla to begin our trek. The flight was amazing as you have to land on a small runway perched on the side of a cliff! At Lukla we met our Sherpa Chandra who had to trek 4 days to meet us.Another amazing person who always seemed to get ahead of us on the Trek although we always started before him. The Sherpas are amazing, some of the loads they were carrying  were twice the size of the carrier but everything was done with a smile. I was glad Arjun packed our main bag as it seemed alot smaller than other packs and we tried to carry as much as possible in our rucksacks to spread the load. Arjun always found us a goor tea house for the night and both his and Chandra's professionalism and knowledge was second to none.Arjun's advice was always politely delivered but we knew to follow it. I can honestly say that i would not have completed the trip if it had not been for the help of these two men. I can not say it was easy to do as some of the days were very tough especially the 2nd days trek to Namche due to no sleep the night before and the effects of altitude. However Arjun's gentle coaxing and endless patience got me through. We also ran into very bad snow storms on the 1st day of our descent and were not able to summit Kala Pathar to see the sunrise over Everest so hopefully we will return soon to do this. This was indeed the most amazing experience made possible by Devi Baral, Arjun and Chandra. When we return we will be using Adventure Nepal Eco Treks. If you have a reasonable degree of fitness then i urge anyone who is interested to do this trip with this company.You wont be disappointed.Thanks Again Devi, Arjun, Chandra and all the friendly staff of the hotel."
Nepal Trip Review with BikeHike Adventures,"Visited Nepal Mach/April 2016...booked through BikeHike Adventures.  The trip was spectacular!!  Trish and Meghan made booking and planning the trip easy.  Everything was looked after from the moment we landed in Kathmandu, to our 2 week hike to Everest Base Camp and back, right up until we departed Kathmandu.  We were a small group of 4, just my husband and I, our guide and porter.  This allowed us to travel at our own pace and to explore what we wished along the way.  We were able to interact with the locals and enjoyed amazing cultural experiences during our trek.A challenging and rewarding trip of a lifetime!  Looking forward to our next BikeHike Adventure!"
Nepal needs you - EBC trek,"We visited Nepal in October 2014 and trekked in the Annapurna region. Following the earthquake we wanted to come back and 'do something'. We looked at volunteering and found that either we did not have any useful skills or what was offered was in fact a holiday with a couple of days 'volunteering'. My other half decided that a trek to Everest Base Camp would be a good idea so we decided to visit purely as tourists and help by spending our money in the country. The Nepalese we spoke to were very grateful for our visit emphasising how our money will pay the wages of the local population.According to our guide tourist numbers are down by some 70% in the Everest region and 60% in the Annapurna region following the dual impact of the devastating earthquake in April 2015 and the politically motivated fuel blockade by India in late 2015, just as Nepal was beginning to recover. Kathmandu was noticeably quieter than our previous visit and there were times on the trek when we did not see another foreigner for miles. The trek itself was amazing from the unnerving flight into one of the most dangerous airports in the world perched on the edge of a mountain to the breath-taking views around every corner. Literally breath-taking the higher you climb! We are 50-somethings of average fitness and had not really done any extra preparation for the trip. We had trekked to Machu Picchu via Dead Woman's Pass (4215m) in November with few problems - how much harder could it be? Everest Base camp is 5364m and Kala Patthar 5545m - the extra 1000m or so makes a huge difference.It is very important to follow the advice of your guide and to have at least 2 rest days during your trek. If you rush up the trail you are far more likely to succumb to altitude sickness. It can and does affect anyone regardless of fitness level. It can start as low as 3000m but we found that we did not really feel any effects until about 4000m. From there you start to slow down, walking up steep paths leaves you gasping for breath, your appetite diminishes and you may not sleep as well. The key to the steep sections is to find your rhythm. Work out how many steps you can take for each breath and stick to it, regardless of how slowly you are progressing. On our climb to the top of Kala Patthar I found that I could keep going without my legs failing by: foot forward, breathe in, foot forward, breathe out. It was slow but I made it shortly after the sun rose above the surrounding mountains. You need to get up there by the time the sun rises as it appears over the shoulder of Everest and you lose any photo opportunities quite quickly. You can trek up there for sunset but it is unlikely to be clear in the Spring - more likely in the Autumn.You can camp on the trail but there are plenty of tea houses in the various settlements along the way. They do vary in quality and facilities but most provide a clean room with either 'ensuite' or shared toilets. Be aware that some do not have running water. At least two villages lost their water supply as a consequence of the earthquake but you will be provided with water to 'flush' the toilet and to wash with. Do not drink local water unless you have treated it with chlorine or iodine tablets. Bottled water is available everywhere and whilst there has been much negative press about the impact of empty bottles etc. you will also find recycling bins along the paths.DO NOT LET ANY OF THE ABOVE PUT YOU OFF!! Nepal is a wonderful country with a huge diversity of culture, scenery and wildlife and lovely people. They need you to visit. You do not have to climb mountains. There are many beautiful old buildings still standing, wildlife to see and adventures to be had. There are also still many people living in tents or makeshift shelters amongst the rubble of their homes, villages without water and children without schools."
Challenge Yourself & You Will Be Rewarded!,"If you are reading this, then you have probably taken up or are thinking of taking yourself on an Amazing Journey, Sightseeing is simply Stunning! Challenge is incredible! You have to get out of your comfort zone and to find a NEW World! Get ready to put up with the basics. A mental as well as physical challenge but take it easy and a day at a time. Allow enough days. Get fit, have a good attitude otherwise the ALTITUDE will get you. Small Groups or Large a personal choice!  Travel with a good travel company who have experience in EMERGENCIES. Don't overthink it. JUST DO IT! But first talk to your doctor to make sure the body is all primed up!."
Amazing Adventure!,"This trek should definitely be on every trekkers bucket list! The minimum time to complete the trek is 13 days but if you have time nothing is stopping you from taking longer just be aware of the very serious risks of altitude sickness if trying to do it in less days. Over my 13 days I saw many people being airlifted, walking or riding horseback to lower ground due to AMS. Please ensure you have insurance! While you only need 14 days to complete the trail you have to include extra days for bad weather etc. My luggage on my international flight was delayed by a day and due to bad weather I flew back from Lukla a day late, so I lost two days luckily I stayed in Nepal for 30 days and was doing the trail independently through a local agency.There are several ways of arranging the trail but I would recommend avoiding the big international or local group tours and rather find a local agency that has great recommendations/reviews and have them arrange your flights, TIMS and staff for an independent trek. Regarding staff I would recommend several options depending on the situation:>If everyone in your group is fit enough to carry all their own gear then I would recommend a Guide(0KG) that can assist with accommodation, knowledge on the region, translating...>If you travelling solo or two people and need help carrying some gear while on a budget then I would recommend a porter-guide(10-15KG) along with a good book on the region to read in the evenings as porter-guides tend to lack on knowledge of the region.>If you more than two people that needs help carrying gear then I would recommend a Guide(0KG) and a Porter (30KG)You only allowed to take a total of 15KG on the plane to Lukla but I would recommend taking only the absolute necessary.I've personally never been to the gym in my life and my training for this trek was basically completing a much easier 21Km hike (low altitude) on both Saturdays and Sundays for three months. I also tried to walk, use the stairs everywhere I went and stuck to healthy home cooked meals avoiding fast and processed foods. On the trail I saw people in their 60's, overweight smokers... The trail itself is not difficult!You have more than enough time to get to the next place you will sleep for the night and there's not much to do once you get there. The accommodation is extremely basic, room with two beds and four walls. Entertainment is hanging around the dining hall, conversations with other trekkers/guides, reading books, playing games... The real fun and entertainment is the actual trail so I recommend sleeping early to get up at the break of dawn for an early start so you can take your sweet time, resting often, taking lots of pictures and enjoying the view.Avoid meat at all costs as its carried up on the backs of people while kept cool using ice. Also try to avoid purchasing bottled water on the trail as the trash has to be carried down and its sad to see how much trash is thrown on the trail. Instead take enough purification tablets and at least two one liter bottles, one nalgene bottle and one metal for filling up with boiling water and throwing in your sleeping bag in the evenings. You can fill up at all guest houses and remember to drink at least four liters a day!The EBC Trek is Amazing! It's filled with Challenging Paths, Breathtaking Views, Amazing Culture, Wonderful People... Its an adventure of a lifetime!!!"
Great experience!,"Our trip to EBC was just great, but that will be another story :) As here I would like to express my gratitude to our guide and to talk a bit about an importance of choosing a proper person for such a serious trip. I am strongly convinced that our success and pleasure was mostly due to our guide Jirel Bhakta Bahadur. Because of his involvement we always benefited a lot. Bhakta has demonstrated not only his commitment to mountain climbing but also great ability to work effectively and tirelessly as a team member. Bhakta definitely has the high potential that he showed consistently in a variety of settings and circumstances. At the same time it was always easy to work with him, as he has great communicative and social skills, being intelligent and good in understanding people. I rate his future potential as very high. He definitely deserves to became Sherpa officially one day.  I believe that Bhakta is a right type of person who is ready, willing and capable of doing his job perfectly. It would be great if I had a chance for obtaining new trekking experience under his supervision."
Everest base camp trek.,Hi all. Firstly I would strongly suggest you prepare yourselves at least 12 months before your trekking.. The trek we did was a 14 day trek from lukla. Please check the itinerary and the distances you will be covering in a day. My personal experience was not a very pleasant one. We trekked from lobouche to gorekshep which took us a good 5-51/2 hours. Than we had 1 hour lunch break and trekked to Everest base camp. Which took us 3 hours. On the way back it started snowing quite heavy and thus I developed hypothermia and fatigue.  I had to be air lifted ASAP. But no helicopters fly in the evenings. My advise to all is please check the distances you will be covering in a day. Fatigue and mountain sickness are very common.  Also be aware the tea house facilities are very basic. And the hygiene standards are pretty mediocre. 😞🙄
Amazing life changing experience,Unbelievable!! Amazing!! This experience i will never forget. This was the hardest thing i ever done in my life. But what an great feeling reaching Everest base camp! So cool!The scenery is amazing. So much beauty. And the locals are amazing to. I loved this place
Great Trek,Fly into Lukla and make your way to Everest Base Camp. Be ready to hike hard every day and to stay in some cold and sometimes musty rooms. You will be rewarded with amazing views of the Himalayas and end up a few pounds lighter.
Everest Base Camp Trek,It was such a good experience. It's hard and you push your self every day during the 13 days. I only did the EBC without any pas and was enough. As soon as you go higher the prices are getting higher as well. Grab a good gloves and jacket because the temperature in March almost on the Base Camp was negative 15. Wind very strong didn't allow us to do Kalapathar. Try to walk around in Kathmandu to get a good deal with everything included in the trekking.
Best trek ever,"It was truly one of the best experiences i have ever had, i visited in oktober 2014 but i newer got to put up the review before i thought about it now. Go to the trek as early as possible since the route can be quite crowded in high season. when me and my friend went be had the trail nearly to ourself and it was a magical experience. It was a great experience to visit and i would love to comeback sometime. A tip our guide was very good, feel free to contact him on facebook his name is Mmtamang Tamang"
Crowded  better to go via  Tibet Lhasa North Col route and if trekking get up much closer staying ABC.,"When treking up consider a detour to the Italian Weather station for a European beer and the best, I mean absolutely the BEST Italian oven Pizza you will ever have! Avoid flying into Lukla take an extra week and hike in helps to acclimatize or take a big risk flying look at the stats and think of your children at home."
"Kala Patthar is great, Renjo La even better","While hiking the 3 passes, we got the chance to see the Sagarmatha several times in clear sunny weather. Good view from Kala Patthar, but the view from Goyko Ri/Renjo La is better. There you can see the Mt. Everest rising up above all!"
Everest Base Camp Trek,"I spent 3 weeks in Nepal in October - the best experience of my life! I was worried because of recent earthquakes and damage, but it did not impact our trip at all.We were trekking as a fundraiser for the charity I run and I had a group of 7. We used a trekking company but I will not recommend them. While everything ran perfectly smoothly and our every need was taken care of, it was due to the staff in Nepal. When we learned how much the trekking company was paying them, we were appalled. The guides have since left the company and work an independent guides. And I HIGHLY recommend them!! (More info later..)The trek was incredible, our guides made sure we went slowly and everyone was fine, physically. Our group ranged in age from 19 to 68 yrs. Those who didn't take Diamox did feel sick at Base Camp, but they made it.The tea houses were perfectly adequate, great food, lovely staff. The scenery was just unlike anything I have ever experienced...other-worldly! And Nepal is so inexpensive, be sure to tip well, because the people are amazing and they are recovering from the earthquake.If you are interested in using an independent guide, PLEASE contact me for more info about the guides we used! This option is MUCH cheaper than using a company and the money goes right to the people and into the economy. Our guides were very knowledgeable, kind, courteous, funny, and always had our best interests at heart. They hired great porters also. We met other travelers who were not impressed by their guides and we felt so fortunate! I would love to recommend our guides to you - please contact me for more info and other testimonials. They were amazing people and I would like to help bring them some business, and also help other travelers avoid the pitfalls of paying too much for this incredible experience.Also, they guide treks ALL OVER Nepal, not just EBC.Our itinerary:KTM-LuklaThe morning that we were supposed to fly to Lukla had less than perfect weather.  Our flight was set for 8am, but by 11am no flights had taken off yet.  One member of our group set off to discuss helicopter options with several people and negotiated a decent price.  The “company” running the helicopters had an office in the airport, but the process of paying by credit card took a while.  Finally, we were driven out beyond the tarmac and half the group took off in a helicopter.  Four of us had to wait until the chopper came back, but it wasn’t long.  That helicopter ride was the most terrifying and yet exhilarating thing I have ever done!  I felt like I could reach out and touch the side of the mountains!  And, during the whole trip, the pilot calmly read a newspaper. We set off for a fairly easy and beautiful walk to Phakding, about 4 hours.Phakding to Namche BazaarThe first 3 hours or so of trekking today were fairly easy – beautiful scenery and the first of 7 suspension bridges before Namche.  I was nervous about the bridges, but they were very stable and even fun, if you’re not afraid of heights!  I had a hearty lunch of noodles, but regretted eating so much later.  The last 90 minutes of the trek before Namche was steeply uphill, hard but not undoable.  I felt sick though, I think because I ate too much before all of that physical exertion!Upon arriving in Namche, we were greeted by a group of adorable children, offering flowers and “Namaste”.  We had an early dinner at our lodge and awoke the next day – our “rest day”.Apparently a rest day includes a 5 hr trek!  In order to encourage acclimation, our guides took us up a gorgeous path to the Everest Hotel and back down.  We spent the rest of the day wandering the many shops, bakeries, bars and restaurants of Namche.Namche to Debouche Another gorgeous days walk with a stop at the monastery in Tengbouche. We were originally supposed to sleep in Tengbouche, but our guide said the water situation was not good in that village.  The monastery was a lovely cultural experience and the grounds were gorgeous. Debouche to PfericheToday’s trek started downhill and after lunch there was a lovely field-like walk with stunning views of Ama Dablam.  We reached Pferiche late afternoon and stayed in my favorite tea house.  Regrettably, the name escapes me, but the steel sculpture memorializing those who have dies on Everest is outside their front door and a small clinic,  Nepalese Rescue Association (NRA), staffed with medical students from the US is right next door.  They specifically cater to trekkers with altitude sickness.  Several members of our grou0 were starting to experience headaches etc…but we didn’t need their services..yet.The lodge is run by a lovely husband and wife team and they had the BEST hot shower of the entire trip!!Pferiche to LobucheThe start of today’s trek was across a wonderful and gorgeous flat field surrounded by mountains – breathtaking! We then reached the edge of the Khumbu Glacier. It is a short, but steep climb up to reach a memorial for the many people who have lost their lives on Everest – a very moving and emotional place.  After leaving the memorial it was about 90 minutes to Lobuche, where we spent the night.Lobuche to Gorek ShepThis was the day we would go to Base Camp!  We were all very excited, but a few members of our group were suffering from Altitude Sickness – they weren’t able to eat or sleep and had pretty bad headaches.  I felt fine, and I know it was because I had been taking Diamox, which I highly recommend.  Despite feeling ill, everyone was determined to move on.We reached Gorek Shep in about 3 hours and had lunch, then started off for Base Camp.  This section was the rockiest we had seen and included a bit of scrambling, but nothing hard.  Once we reached Base Camp, our lovely guides had a ceremony for us, distributed tea and took all the photos we wanted.  There were a few other group there also, everyone celebrating their accomplishment.We didn’t stay long, as a few members of our group felt pretty bad.  As we headed down, we over took a group we had seen at Base Camp.  One woman was virtually being carried by her guide and another man, very sick.  It was strange, as I remembered her being very animated at Base Camp, happy and jumping around.  The altitude sickness must have come on quite quickly for her.  Later in Gorek Shep, we learned that she had to be evacuated by helicopter.We ate a quick dinner and everyone went to bed early.  We discussed the next day’s trip to Kala Pataar, which is supposed to give the best view of the peak of Everest.  We decided that those who felt ill would descend immediately in the morning to Pferiche, while our assistant guide would take the others up Kala Pataar and meet us later.Back to LuklaBy morning everyone was feeling fine and we continued our way down to Lukla, which only took 2 days.What an amazing trip!  Our guides took incredible care of us – especially those suffering from altitude sickness.  We ended our trek by treated them and our porters to a yak steak dinner the night before flying back to KTM.Just an amazing, life-changing experience!!!"
Everest Base Camp Trek with Glorious Himalaya Trekking team,"Everest base camp trek is the pace to visit once in your lifetime and one of the world's famous trekking trail of Nepal and it is highly recommended for the adventure seekers from the globe.

The view from Kalapather was outstanding - no words to explain, you just feel when you will be there.  Well, we booked our 15 days Everest base camp organized trek with Glorious Himalaya Trekking Pvt. Ltd. in the month of April 2015. And we are soo satisfied with their services which meet our expectations, their competitive prices and the staffs of company was experienced friendly, hardworking and smiling faces as well. Moreover, we would like to suggest the travelers to get an organized trek with an agency and you will feel secure and get more and more information about the region from the local peoples. And more importantly local will get chance to earn some money."
Everest Base Camp - worth every step!,"Highly, highly recommend this trek for anyone who feels fit enough to tackle it. The views are breathtaking (literally) and absolutely like nothing else you will see anywhere. I did this in a tour with other people, but saw plenty who hired porters and did it themselves, and even one or two without porters or guide. I would recommend at least having a guide, in case of emergency - we saw more than one person airlifted down due to severe altitude sickness."
Everest Basecamp trekking,"I booked my Everest basecamp trekking whit Himalayan mentors, it was amazing and the company organised everything really perfectly after my preferences. I did the trekking whit one guide, Dawa he is a really good guide who is born in the Everest region and really know what he is doing.  Himalayan mentors really did my trip to Nepal unforgettable!"
Top of the world,"I did the Everest Base Camp in 2015 November.It was a 12 day trek which was difficult, terrific and breathtaking at the same time. This has the potential to change nay persons life and change their perspective."
back packing trip to the roof of the world......,"Quite simply the ultimate place to visit. I created a lifetime of memories on this trip last autumn, the scenery speaks for itself, it was humbling and inspiring to view the highest peak and the most famous mountain on the planet. It is hard slog, but get on an organised trek and you will get great local advice with their own brand of humour! And meet some great people from different parts of the world. Yes the air is thinner, but so fresh, just make sure you are in reasonable shape!"
Beautiful Sagarmatha National Park,"We did an 11 day trek from Lukla and it was a once in a lifetime experience...that I hope to recreate at some point. Spectacular views at every turn, especially of Ama Dablam, Llotse and Everest. Do it!"
Easiest view from a plane,Viewing Everest from a plane on the way to Bhutan was a wonderful experience. I never did see it in Nepal but the clear air above the clouds makes for a great siting.
Be prepared,"Done this EBC like 10 days total.. I am not a person go to gym nor exercise.. but just want to see everest.. I find the most difficult was around 4800m-5200m part. it's hard to describe the thin air about.. but just walk few steps and take a break, that's for me.. but I really enjoy the trek, SOOOOOO beautiful.. all the way to the base camp are beautiful, there are different villages alone the trek.. the tea houses also offer you nice meals and drinks.. you can take so many photos all the way to the end.. of course the everest for sure.. just make sure you know your body well. on my trip, i know some people died for the high altitude. regardless those from local or fit young man.. I knew they died even around 4200m.. so, listen to your body and if you got to run down to the lower level, just go. don't die up there. be prepare for your trip. need good hiking shoes and strong in mind for sure"
Trekking to highest point of the earth.,"Everest is very interesting and heaven trekking. When you reach at the top of the world highest point you feel so different. On this trekking You could be able to see different Sherpa culture and traditions. People most of them are Buddhist.You could feel so different in this trek, even in this trek you can see different wild animals and birds. If you are lucky you can see our National bird.You can also see some different monastery from Buddhism in this trek.You can see a life style in Himalaya region of Nepal."
Awesome Winter EBC Trip,"My two sons (16 and 18) and I trekked with Trek Around Nepal.  Our guide was Bhakta Jirel (200+ EBC treks and many others around Nepal) and our porter was the wunderkind Samir.  Their advice was always perfect and every detail went off without a hitch.  It was cold at night but walking in the sun was a shorts and shirt affair.   It cost $900 each including flights, permits, accommodation and food.  Bhakta chose great tea houses and always checked the kitchen to ensure good health.  He is a really funny, friendly guy who was Mr Popularity on the trail - he knew heaps of people and there was always lots of laughter.  A special thing to note was how flexible and responsive to our needs they were.  We did the full EBC trek in 10 days and got back to Kathmandu for Christmas - my lads were thrilled.  Trek Around Nepal were faultless and provided reliable, professional service at every point.  I would recommend this family-run agency to anyone."
Everest Base Camp Trek,"I have been to Nepal 6 times and each time I go I trek with Prem Pandit who owns and runs a trekking company based in Kathmandu. Mountain Hawk Treks. Prem is without doubt the best trekking guide in Nepal. I would not do trek unless he was my guide. He has taken me to Everest Base Camp twice, as well and the Annapurna Circuit. Other trekkers on our recent Everest Trek were comparing Prem with their guides and were all saying that I clearly had the best guide. Prem exceptionally well organized, knowledgeable and conservative in decision making to ensure the safety of this whole team including the porters. Prem has guided Everest Base Camp more than 100 times. If you want the best, safest and most enjoyable time then call Prem."
Everest Base Camp in Winter!,"My partner and I recently trekked with Advanced Adventures to Everest Base Camp and I highly recommend using this company if you are considering trekking to EBC or anywhere in the Himalayas. We were so well looked after, both our guide and porter were very attentive, knowledgable, friendly and went at our pace the whole time. We enjoyed out trip immensely and would not have made it to base camp without them. Being winter is was very cold and we both got a little bit sick along the way but with the help of our guide we still made it! We felt safe the whole way and were free to just enjoy the magnificent views rather than worry about accommodation or our health! Other trekkers commented on how well our guide and porter were looking after us, definitely one of the best adventures of our life!!"
Tips for a great EBC tour - Winter Season,"It has been said over and over how great this trip is. I absolutely agree so I won't labour that point any further. What I will provide is some tips that I inherited prior, during and at the conclusion of my tour.1. Fail to Plan, Plan to FailWith up to 3 rescue helicopters a day pulling Trekkers out over my 11 days, I can assure you that the vast majority of these people failed to plan and therefore failed to reach EBC. It amazes me how many people I spoke to and when they told me how they were approaching the trek, I knew they were destined to failure. Some made it to EBC but had no stamina to reach Kalla Pattar or simply exhibited many symptoms along the way from migraines to vomiting and diarrhea, blisters, eye infections etc. I am an office worker who had never trekked before, but I read so much before I left, watched YouTube videos, read blogs etc so I was absolutely prepared & I can say it paid off as I never once had a headache, vomiting, diarrhea, I did start to get a blister or two and a sore knee etc but I was prepared.2. Pack List EssentialsI won't go through every item, but these were things I read about and took and so glad I did.- can't stress the need for a high quality down jacket, gloves, boots, wind jacket. When I say high quality I mean like RAB or Arcteryx, and boots like Zamberlan or Scarpa, gloves like Outdoor Research. It's cold, always cold. Whilst hiking you will warm up but when you stop or are at a guest house etc, it's just freezing. Also if doing Kalla Pattar, we like most left at 4am and with -20 degrees, if you don't have the right gear you will suffer and that is a guarantee because Trekkers who came unprepared told me how their hands were freezing etc. Even the guides laugh at how Trekkers come with gloves not designed for this climate. So I had three pairs, woolen liners for day hiking or around the guesthouses, trekking gloves with fleece and waterproof gortex for not so cold conditions and double gloved, top of the range snow gloves rated for minus degrees for the really cold treks and I will say even then my fingers were still a little cold.Boots I purchased Zamberlan leather, water proof, gortex, tough and heavy boots ankle supports the lot. They were expensive but like tired on a car, they prevented me from many a twisted ankle, major blisters, cold feet or basic slipping on loose rocks. The terrain is unforgiving, make no mistake, it's not flat, so invest wisely,Down Jacket RAB 800 down and Arcteryx wind stopper and down lightweight trekking jacket. These were my absolute essentials. The RAB I used every night at guesthouses and also from Loubche to EBC and Kalla Pattar. The Arcteryx wind stopper I barely needed as it was sunny every day except the last few, weather changed suddenly to almost snowing and freezing high winds. The Arcteryx day down lightweight was the the best of all, so warm, so lightweight which I wore over a heavy Patagonia fleece, thermals, etc.Other must haves- rope for a clothes line in your room. After trekking you will sweat so you need to get out of sweaty clothes fast and let them dry or you will freeze.- solar charger I purchased Power Monkey, hung it off my back pack whilst hiking and basically had better charge than the solar charge higher up that you pay 350 rupee for one hour or 500 rupee for full charge, but it can take almost a day to charge an iPhone higher up on solar in guesthouses. The cold as everyone says drains your battery exceptionally fast so I slept with all my batteries and electronics every night, and kept them on me throughout the day in my down jackets.- hand and feet warmers buy from pharmacy, amazing how good these are when you get to Gorek Shep and beyond.- sleeping bag I hired and was rated minus 30 and it was, but still needed at least two blankets plus two Nalgenes full of hot water to stay warm- buffs incredibly important unless you like breathing freezing cold air and dust- thermals two pairs wool a must for staying warm- clothing that is all made from wool because after not washing for 10 days it still did not smell and drys very fast when washed. - two trekking poles. There are a lot of people trying to prove they are tough by not using poles or taking diamox etc but let me tell you, I met a guy once on the Namche acclimatization hike who had no poles because he was trying to be tough and I said well it's either use more energy and get AMS or knee injuries etc and a helicopter ride out of here or get some poles. Next day after that hike he had poles times two.- diamox is another one where people think it's a badge of go out if you didn't take diamox. Frankly know one cares, so I took it almost from Lukla and then drank 5 liters of water a day but I didn't suffer once. People who didn't take it were either flown out or suffered in their opinion immensely.- insurance is a MUST because there is a lot that can go wrong, AMS, twisted ankles, eye infections, food poisoning etc etc- cash take at least 70,000 rupee, 35,000 for incidentals like charging, hot water, food etc and then 35,000 in case there is an emergency because insurance can take time, cash is king and will get you out of any situation.- first aid kit with nurofen, anti histamine for the coughs you will develop, deep heat for muscles, paracetamol. Most important eye drops and electrical tape for blister prevention, band aids do not work or stay on.3. HealthI was lucky that my guide had 12 years experience, had trekked that route over 100 times and had also climbed to South Col on Everest. He told me from Lukla, no meat, eggs, cheese, milk, etc, only vegetable and noodles etc.I also took purification tabs but never used one because everyone I met was buying bottled water or boiled water which is what I did.I stopped smoking after Lukla and never drank alcohol.People who are eggs and cheese or alcohol paid dearly with vomiting etc. of course not all the time, it was a gamble. Trust me, you don't want to be sick up there when you see the guesthouses or toilet areas.Wipes I took for my daily wash. I never had hot water but basically it was too cold to strip down even for a few minutes.Water is your best friend, I drank 5 liters a day but also ate double the calories I normally eat at home and still lost weight. I drank one litre in the morning, two whilst hiking, one at dinner and then one throughout the nightI know this bit seems crude but when you drink this much you may need the toilet as much as 3 to 4 times a night, so as a man I had two spare Nalgene bottles for a toilet meaning I never had to get out of my sleeping bag or suffer the pain of waiting. I will let you work this bit out, practice before you go on the trek, it makes such a difference. Note I had 2 liters a night.That's about it really, take a head torch, handy at night especially for those toilet trips. If you have any questions please email me Thanks"
Don't bother with Base Camp - Kala Pattar from Gorak Shep is the best view.,"If you want to trek independently in this region, it is possible to hire a guide at Lukla, but you're best off organising it before you leave Kathmandu, as it's leaving it to chance otherwise. We were lucky enough to book Soroj from Kathmandu, and he was a wonderful guide who took great care of us, checking out the kitchens of the lodges we stayed at to make sure they were clean, helping us to assess and administer altitude sickness medication, finding the path through difficult terrain, booking a porter, and taking my arm to hold me up when slipping along glacier surfaces. I can't recommend him highly enough (Thokar Soroj Tamang on Facebook) As for the scenery - Gokyo Ree was a highlight - one of three on our trip including Cho La pass and Kala Pattar - difficult but not impossible even for me, a fifty something librarian who did not train for the trip. Altitude made things harder, but being in that scenery was just incredible and amazing and unforgettable. I did realise that I needed a porter once arrived at Namche Bazaar, but Soroj was able to organise even that at a good price for us. As for Everest in particular, it is the black mountain - so steep that the snow slips off it. Best view is from Kala Pattar at sunset - the base camp is a disappointment, especially at the end of the season as it is completely uninhabited, and for trekkers not climbing the mountain it is really just a supply drop off point as the mountaineers don't want to be bothered with sightseers."
Heian Treks Everest Base Camp trek,"Thank you so much Heian Treks for arranging our Everest Base Camp trek. Our guide Gopal was fantastic and his professionalism, guidance, support and friendship made our trip a success. His encouragement and knowledge of the area ensured we not only trekked but also learned about the area. He ensured we were well looked after at every Teahouse when our trekking day was over. Gopal not only looked after us but also our two porters. He made sure they had sleeping bags etc and that they ate and had somewhere warm to sleep.We enjoyed our friendly banter and the new card game he taught us, even if he did cheat at times!We would have no hesitation recommending Heian Treks to anyone wanting to enjoy not only the magnificent scenery but also get to know the beautiful Nepalese people and their culture. Discussions have already begun about the next Nepal trip!Craig, Justin & Chris Heskett and Adam WatersonNovember 2015"
Everest Base Camp Trek Advanced Adventures,"My husband, daughter and myself have just a 17 day package with Advanced Adventures to reach Everest Base Camp successfully, when so many other people did not! Our trek allowed for 14 days trekking  plus 3 days in Kathmandu! The best thing you can do to acclimatise is to go slowly! Most people only give themselves 12 days, which isn't enough time to enjoy the view and also stop in at Khumjung, which has the Hilary Hospital, schools and Sherpas! Our accommodation was owned by Pema Chhosang Sherpa, who has reached the summit of Everest 3 times, and other surrounding mountains many times! It was so good to sit around the fireplace with him and his family and talk about the fantastic work that the Sherpa do to make it possible for people to climb these mighty hills!! Our guide Lok was informative, caring and so easy to get along with, and our wonderful porters, Bisnu and Roman, were always cheerful and watching out for us! Without this great team, we may not have the great memories of this once in a lifetime adventure! The easy pace is definitely the key to a successful trek, we saw so many people who were in a hurry and then suffered with altitude sickness! This was our third trek with Lok and Advanced Adventures and we would highly recommend them! Lok got us over Thorong-La at 5416 metres in the snow on the Annapurna Circuit in October, the Chispanpi Trek in November and now the Everest Base Camp trek! We feel very safe in Nepal, the people are amazing especially considering the natural disasters and Indian blockade which is still in progress! Come to Nepal! The experience will stay with you forever!"
Amazing experience with Advanced Adventures to Mount Everest Base Camp,"When me and my friend booked our trek to Everest base camp with Advanced Adventures we were a little unsure of how it is was going to turn out considering neither of us had any trekking experience. However, the amazing team at Advanced Adventures (especially our guide Santosh) made us feel really comfortable and whilst it was not easy, we both felt like we had the best possible guidance and hospitality for a very reasonable price! The trek is simply amazing and no photos or videos are able to accurately describe the enormity and magnificence of the Himalayas. Advanced Adventures is a Nepal based company, it is very reasonably priced and has all the luxuries that other more expensive companies have to offer. Considering the hard year Nepal has had with the Earthquake and recent Fuel crisis we were truly amazed at how smoothly everything went (we even got a free upgraded to a helicopter ride on our way to lukla!). Thank you Santosh and Advanced Adventures for an incredible experience!!"
Amazing but challenging trek- beautiful scenery- and some helpful advice!,"We just finished a 14 day group trek with Ace the Himalaya and had a fantastic time.  Everyone in our group made it to Everest Base Camp and many of us did the next morning hike to Kala Patthar 18,315ft.  Although you can go alone, I definitely know that our trip was easier and more enjoyable in the hands of Ace the Himalaya.  They make sure their passengers are on the first flights from Kathmandu to Lukla.  This is no small thing.  On the day we left, our flight (the first of the day) was the only one to go that day.  Many flights are cancelled due to weather each day.  Also, due to the fuel shortage, the allowed weight is reduced to 15kg per person before being charged an additional fee.   On the way back from Lukla after the trek, the airport waiting room was jammed with passengers, but again, Ace had us booked on the first flight and once again, we made it without problems.  Sometimes people are stuck there for 3-4 days! Ace arranged for the porters to meet us in Lukla.  One porter carries gear for two trekkers.  There is supposed to be a 20kg limit per porter which should include their personal gear- so make sure you weigh your bag before you go.  When you see the terrain and how hard they work, you will definitely want your bag to be as light as possible.We had a lead guide named Kishore and two assistant guides; Prem and Dev.  All of the tea houses were arranged for us on the way and the guides were great at making sure all of our needs were met.   We ate a lot of Dahl Bhat which was tasty, but also enjoyed the potato dishes and fried noodles.  Take their advice and eat the vegetarian option.  There are eggs for protein.  We brought trail mix from home to mix into our porridge in the morning for extra protein and flavor.The tea houses were basic, but the food was good and there were extra thick blankets on all the beds.  That was greatly appreciated because the rooms were not heated and it got very cold at night.  We made sure to order hot boiled water in our liter Nalgene bottles before bed ($1-3 dollars depending on altitude of tea house- price got higher as we went higher).  The hot water bottle felt amazing in the sleeping bag.  I brought an extra garbage bag from home to put my hot water bottle in case it ever leaked, but it didn't.  This water is great to drink in the morning as well because it won't be so cold as regular water.You can order filtered tap water in most places for a small charge to put straight in your water bottle.  Regular bottled water is available, but they discourage its use due to environmental issues.  We brought a steri-pen to treat the water and never had any problems.  Other people used tablets or filtration devices.  We tried to drink 4 liters per day.Although it was very cold at night, during the day while we hiked, it was in the 50's and 60's and very sunny.  We wore long hiking trousers and a long sleeve shirt and a sun hat and felt fine most days. Lots of sunscreen on exposed areas!   It was cold in the first part of the morning requiring mittens/gloves and a down jacket.   On the day we reached Everest Base Camp, it was probably in the 30's Fahrenheit so that day we dressed much warmer.   The early morning climb to Kala Patthar was the coldest since we left at 4:30am to see the sunrise.  We wore ski-pants and our down jackets and fleeces underneath, hats and gloves/mittens and felt fine.Regarding altitude.  My husband and I did Kilimanjaro in February 2015 and now this trek and we have not had any sickness so I'm feeling pretty confident about our strategy.  I did extensive research before Kilimanjaro and this is what we did.  1. Diamox prescription.  We took 125mg 2x per day.  On waking and then around 6pm.  We tried the Diamox at home for a day or two well before the trip to make sure we were not allergic and to see how it felt.  The only side effects we felt was a tingling in the ends of the fingers and on the scalp for about 45 minutes after taking (I actually thought it felt kind of cool!)  It does make you have to urinate more, but if you try to consume your 4 liters before 7pm, it will cut your night time bathroom visits.  We started the Diamox in Namche Bazaar 11,286ft and continued taking it until we returned to Namche Bazaar.2.  We took 120mg Ginko Biloba two times daily for 5 days before beginning ascent.  We read that you should build up to 240mg so 3 weeks before the trek we took one pill daily and let that lead into the 5 days of increased dosage.  We never had any side effects.  I read that Ginko and Diamox interact with each other so stop the Ginko before beginning Diamox. 3.  600mg of ibuprofen at each new altitude but not on the acclimatization days.  4.  Mountain Might natural supplements.  We took these both for Kilimanjaro and Everest as directed for 10 days during the trek.  I ordered them online.5. Yoga breathing.  After each day's trek, we did some deep breathing exercises.  We would sit or lie flat and breathe in for 4 counts and out forcefully for 4 counts.  This really helps to oxygenate the blood!  Do at least 10 cycles of this breathing each day and whenever you feel a headache coming on.  While hiking we made sure to forcefully breathe out to help dispel carbon dioxide.  6.  Vinpocetine: 10mg 4x daily during the trek.  You can read about this online when searched with altitude remedy into your browser.7.  Walk slowly!!!!  Even more slowly than you think!  There is more than enough daylight to get to each new place so take it slow!  The scenery is so beautiful and you only help yourself when you go slowly.  Going too quickly can really dampen your immunity.  Trust me.  Slow is the only way to go!8.  Give up alcohol and caffeine during the trek or until you are heading back down from Namche.  Tea is fine.All of the things we did may sound like overkill, but I cannot stress how great we felt on both of these treks.  Sure you can grind it out and make it to the top, but don't you want to ENJOY it?  A lot of people around us got various degrees of altitude sickness ranging from headaches to nausea, weakness, and several people got colds and flu-like symptoms.  We felt fine and healthy the entire time!There is definitely a thing called KHOMBU COUGH and many people in our group and those we met on the trail suffered from this.  It's a cough that comes on as you gain altitude from the thin air, dust, and lack of oxygen.  Bring cough drops and cough syrup.  It does go away as you descend, but it made many people pretty miserable for those few days.  I read that wearing a Buff over your mouth in the high air can help to prevent it as well.   I would suggest bringing cold/allergy medicine as well.  There are a lot of animals on the trail and a lot of dust in certain places and it can have its effect.Training:  We lived near the mountains so that's where we trained, but if you don't, I would recommend going for long walks or hikes on whatever terrain you have available to you.  If you go slowly on the actual trek, the steepness won't be that huge of a factor, but you definitely have to be ready to walk 6-8 hours each day.  So, try to build up to 2 one hour long hikes/walks during the week and one long hike/walk on the weekend building to the length of 6-7 hours in one shot.   Since the porters carry most of your gear, you just need to carry your daypack which with water will probably weigh 10-12lbs.  Carry that when you train. Tipping:  The porters do get paid, but they have to pay their own expenses which nets them about $2 a day.  They work so hard---you will see so be generous.  The minimum tip just for the porters should be $50 per trekker for a 14 day trip (12 days trekking with them).  You can decide what to give for your guides, but they say that 10% of your overall trip price is a good guideline for the total tips for everyone.Since we did our trek in early November, I brought our left-over Halloween candy to hand out to kids we met.  They definitely wanted that instead of pens or pencils.  I would have brought coloring books and crayons etc, but with the weight restrictions on the flights to Lukla, I didn't have room in my bag.  Bubbles are always a big hit with kids.  You can bring a bottle or two and blow some for passing kids.  They really go crazy!!!!!I wished that I had a little thermometer for the outside of my day pack.  We were all so curious to know what the actual temperature was day and night and in our rooms.  If you can find one, it could be useful to bring.  Also, I bought a Luci Outdoor inflatable solar lantern from REI for $15 and it was immensely helpful.  It gains solar power during the day attached to your pack and it powers so brightly at night for 8-10 hours or more.  Casts great light and was really great to use on our ascent of Kala Patthar.  I had it hanging at my waist and it illuminated the ground for walking but I was able to look up and see the stars so clearly (as opposed to everyone else wearing headlamps).  The solar lamp wasn't effected by the cold.  Oh yes, keep your phones and cameras and other devices with batteries in your sleeping bags with you at night to preserve the battery power.  Cold sucks them down big time.You need to bring a lot of cash with you because there aren't many chances for ATM's except in Kathmandu and Namche.  My husband and I spent about $17 US per day each on meals including buying filtered and boiled water.  We did not drink alcohol or soda on the trip.  We loved the hot lemon ginger honey tea!  Hope all these tips help!  Have a great trek!  Don't cancel or postpone your trip!  Nepal needs our tourism and they are set up to make sure it's safe and successful."
Everest Base Camp while Winter was on its way,"It was cold but with the warm clothes and strong courage, it was a best trip for a life! I will be looking forward to do it more!"
Mount Everest Base Camp,"Everest Base Camp is definitely the place for the one who has attitude for altitude. Amazing views, breathtaking spaces. Every mountain lovers place. The place where the passage 15 steps causes shortness of breath, a night out with a sleeping bag and a trip to the toilet is a silent trip. In short, it has to be experienced!"
Cafe de basecamp,Nice place to visit andvery beautifull veiws for mountains and riveres. Nice place to visit in nepal.
Amazing! Unsurpassable!,"When you're literally on top of the world, what else could you ever want? This is the place to see and to be! A definite ""must"" on everyone's bucket list!"
WITHOUT WORDS,"I had the opportunity to go to the base camp from the Nepalese and the Tibetan side. The Nepalese side is surrounded by huge sumits, so the Everest is barely to see from the base camp. It feels like being on another planed. The weather condition changed in minutes but right before I was able to do my photographs. The base camp was empty when I was visiting."
EBC Trek,Trekked for 14 days in the Himalayas reaching the Everest Base Camp (EBC). We booked through Everest Hiking Treks and Expedition and met our guide in Kathmandu. The trek itself was an amazing experience but be warned that you will probably suffer to some degree due to the altitude. That said our was limited to the occasional mild headache and general breathlessness over 5000m. Its definitely an experience one should add to their bucket list
Ebc trek tips,"A few tips from our EBC trek, (ps wonderful places, truly wonderful trek, one of the best travel in our life) we arrived on October 4 on base camp:we are a 50 years old couple, not very fit and at our first trek, however, we managed to avoid AMS and gastrointestinal problems by taking it easy in the ascent, eg 3 nights in Namche instead of 2 and 2 nights in DingbocheDrinking lots of water in various forms (eg local hot soups, hot lemons, avoided teas and coffee in afternoon/nights not to spoil the sleeping chances), we always drunk bottled water or very hot teas/etcEating  traditional Nepali/Sherpa food especially in those lodges where we felt the customer turnover was not too high (and thus the frozen pizza or similar imported food possibly expired or unadvisable)We did not need Diamox albeit we had it with us ready to be taken in case of serious AMS symptomsused the cardiofrequenzimeter especially in the 3 steep ascents (namche, tengboche, lobuche) and we found it very precious to ""discover"" our ""right steady"" but not exaggerated walking pace, that by the way then proved in line with the guides/book average assumed timing had with us the oxymeter (you can buy on Amazon, eBay) and it was mainly useful to check if  the levels of oxygen of each of us kept broadly aligned throughout in the ascent (we measured 79 in gorak shep and 86 in pheriche)In the lodges most meals are made-to-ordee so you have to order  in advance, however this practice increases the quality and the safety of the lodgesbrought maybe too many clothes, in fact especially above 4000 mts you dont change much yourself :( had a huge box of medicines, it was not a bad idea, in most places if you dont have medicines you can only hope some other traveller would have....Several nights were cold or very humid (also in the lower valley) so we asked often for extrablankets and regretted not to have with us a couple of hot water bags to be filled by the lodgeSone rooms were a bit ""smelly"", we used incense in those occasionsMany lodges have wifi (not free)It was good to have lipstick, sunprotection and real antiUVA sunglassesWe were lucky with the guide and porter, two great persons that made our trek easier, pleasant and very ""human""You find bottled water everywhere with price per bottle climbing from $0.80 in Lukla to $3 in Lobuche/GorakShepIf you like dogs this is a great place, there are many beautiful, semidomesticated, incredibly clean dogs that wander around trekkers looking for food and the occasional hug.we brought pens for the children as per some guide suggestions...well the beautiful Sherpa children like their peers elsewhere want chocolate not pens :) Between Lobuche and GorakShep you may want to make a one hour deviation to visit the Italian-Nepali research center shaped like the Louvre pyramid and mirroring the above magnificent Pumori. Depending on how busy they are you may have a look inside the pyramid.Did it all go right? No, she strived to sleep in the first week, he suffered from a acute back pain in the ""highest"" days, but we both thrived and survived :)"
Best experience ever,Trekking in Nepal is something some people dream of and when you're there it is simply amazing! I'm dreaming of the next time I return. The Nepalese people are amazing and make the trip extra memorable.
Stunning Himalayas,"The Himalayas have to be one of the wonders of the world. Their sheer magnificence is amazing, up as afar as the eye can see. Yes, the views of Mt Everest are not as clear as the photos you see but what you do see are far more incredible peaks such as Ama Dhablem, Lhotse and Nuptse. Also the incredible journey through small villages, staying at lovely guesthouses and unbelievable valleys and forests. You will test your resolve and inner strength but emerge a stronger, more humble person for the experience"
Top of the World and great amazing lifetime adventure experience...,Even the deadly earthquake hits with avalanche takes more than dozen peoples are missing still the place is standstill and its beauty.The area is still safe for trekking and no major damage.It is lifetime adventure experience not only views of top of the world Everest where can enjoy and see beautiful mountain scenery and local tradition and customs too with mountain people Sherpa....
EBC trek,"Well worth the energy and time. Note that views of Everest itself are not that great however the journey is something you will remember forever. Spectacular place, lovely people, amazing journey. This trip isn't for everyone. You have to be willing to grind along for days and days but it is an amazing part of the world to visit. I feel that this is more of a mental challenge than physical and that anyone with the desire to get there will do it regardless of physical ability. I had a porter and a guide, however, if you are young and fearless, it can be competed without any support. Just buy a map."
Right decision for the life time adventure!,"We had a plan to visit Nepal for a long time and booked a trek to Everest base camp in August 2015 but the after earthquake in Nepal make us think to visit or not. We have sent many emails to our agency Breakfree Adventures back and forth and they really inspire to us to visit!We landed in Kathmandu and surprised that there was nothing damage compared with what we have seen in TV. Our trip started from Kathmandu with sightseeing tours and the historical sites was little damage but still worthy to visit.The trek to Everest base camp was a lifetime decision we make to go with Breakfree Adventures. They are really big company with warm hospitality we have ever got in our 20 years of travelling experience. The guides they arranged to us, the manager in the company, and especially their updates on every aspect are really bonus which we have chosen this company.So, if you are planning to go Nepal and looking for a wonderful trekking experience, just go with Breakfree Adventures! Nothing to look further, perfect company for your budget as well."
Most amazing experience ever,"Flew into lukla airport and then spent 11days trekking to Basecamp and back to airport.It's a very rewarding experience hiking to Basecamp, can be tiring with air getting thinner the higher you get.Best to get a porter/guide as some parts can be confusing, but I did see many people trekking without guides.You should have a rest day at every 1000 metres to acclimatise so make sure you do as safety should always come first.Accommodation and food along the way very good with many choices.Very memorable trip to do and very rewarding."
My EBC Trek Apr-15,"I have done a variety of treks & tougher than this one... however this one in terms of duration, varying landscapes, scenic beauty, cultures, is unparalled! A must do for all nature lovers & trekkers!"
Awesome to be see the Highest Peak in the World,It was an awesome experience to view the Mount Everest from the Mountain Flight. Once in a lifetime opportunity.
Life time experience!,"Dozen time guiding experience, I would say it is the best you could reach with little experience so high. Amazing Khumbu Glacier, close view of Nuptse, Everest on the way to BC. Make your journey to BC for the life time experience."
"worlds best and cheap,","the trip to nepal -mail attraction is mount everest feel in difeerent ways.worlds best mountainflight is happened in kathmandu.food is also very cheap.but roads are very foogy,noisy,and crowdy."
Hiking to Everest Base Camp,"Everest Base camp is at the height of 17500 feet.You can view beautiful Khumbu Glacier from there.Peaks Lhotse,Nuptse and Changste can be seen from Everest Base camp if the weather is clear.Must Visit."
Amazing,It is difficult to tell people how amazing these mountains are. The sheer size and beauty of them can only be experienced in person. It is all that more rewarding after a long trek to get there.
Terrific,Awesome the best experience of my life yet with the yeti airlines hats off Nepal with an awesome hospitality which they are providing to foreigners .....!Awesome....Dream become true......!
"EBC South, Nepal","A himalayan lover , specially trekker should not miss this relatively easy hike to EBC. A standard itinerary takes 14/15 days with two acclimatization rest day at Namche & Dingboche. The tea-house trek style is completely different from what is available standard treks in India. So you can opt for solo trek also. depending on your strength you may take help of porter or not. Taking guide is not mandatory till date but Nepal Govt may make it very soon , due to recent incidents and mishaps ( Annapurna - Oct 2014,eBC -khumbu accident (april 2014) and ofcourse the great earthquake of April 2015). Don't miss the Gokyo lakes if you can afford with time and provided you are fit. Feel free to PM for any help/tips."
Top Of The World Beauty,"I definitely recommend the trek to the top of the World to everyone who like spending time in the mountains. Athough a bit challenging in some parts due to the thin air, the views you get are certainly worth the effort. Beautiful nature, culture, people... I was lucky to have a guide Dinesh Rai, the friendliest guide I've ever met, who knows each step and stone of EBC trek.  I definitely reccomend him, as having such a quality guide surely enriches one's travel experience. Good luck and enjoy!"
Everest Base Camp with Advanced Adventures,"We recently used Advanced Adventures for the EBC trek and highly recommend the company and especially our guide Lok. We were in the village of Dingbuche when the earthquake happened (thankfully we are fine) and are indebted to our guide for all his assistance in helping us back down the mountain.  After the earthquake and despite the devastation of the countryside and teahouses we were able to secure shelter, food and lodging until we could fly out of Lukla.  Meanwhile many other trekkers were left to sleep outside in the cold and in a blizzard. For this we are truly grateful.  Furthermore, our guide was a genuinely nice guy. We encountered several other guides from other companies who were trying to rip off their clients, asking for money and other inappropriate things. In contrast our guide was professional throughout.  Even after the earthquake and before our guide could reach his family to see if they were ok he made sure that we were fine. Really outstanding service. We could not recommend them enough."
Just go and see!,"Nothing beats being higher then a jumbo jet besides the fact everything you see is simply breath taking. The path to base camp is also simple awe inspiring, beyond here what else but the moon and beyond!"
"Beautiful day, awesome views",We took a helicopter from Namche bazaar to base view hotel and then flew over base camp and environs only days before the earthquake. We may have had the last great views of base camp and the ice flow before disaster struck. It was breathtaking and incredible.
An amazing experience...!,"Had always been fascinated to trek the Himalayas so on a whim last November whilst book  asking some final bookings for a tour around Asia added this trek on. I was not disappointed!I booked with G adventures, and we were a group of 14. Luckily, the group were lovely and I have made some great friends from this trip! The trek itself was a huge challenge mentally and physically, particularly as you climb to higher altitudes. I am pretty fit and train on average five days a week in London, but this trek is incredibly difficult at times! We were faced with some terrible weather conditions (the day we arrived at Namche bazaar it snowed by around 11cm which made our acclimatisation climb the following day incredibly treacherous!) and we also had a hail storm on our last day back into Lukla leaving us to shelter in a local families home. During the hail storm the trail had turned to ankle deep rivers of mud (I wish I had managed to catch photos...it was truly a sight to behold!)I guess the moral of this story is GO PREPARED! Good, solid waterproof shoes, a few sets of thermals, waterproof outerwear are the way to go...I'd have been uncomfortable for twelve days without! The views, the culture in the mountains and the warmth and hospitality of the people is second to none. Just make sure you take extra money to why is recommended as prices really do increase dramatically the higher you go (understandable when you see the labour that goes into transporting goods into the mountains) The trip was incredibly well run with our guides Gelu and Pemba and a team of 5 Sherpas/ porters carrying our bags. I would highly recommend this trip; it was worth every minute of hardship!"
Everest Base Camp Trek,"We Reached the Everest base camp (17700 feet) in the Sagarmata national park area after 8 days, trekking approx. 32 miles (50 kms), 9 hours a day, taking 12000 plus steps a day. The EBC trek is an extremely challenging but an awesome and beautiful one. In this trek, we were rewarded with both spectacular scenery as well as a huge sense of personal achievement. You will traverse scenery that will literally take your breath away. Like a picture postcard that changes daily, you’ll find yourself lost in a mountainous terrain that changes from lush farmland and dense forest to clear blue rivers, glacial pools and stark white mountains. And when you finish the day’s trek all emotional and exhausted, you will always feel a huge sense of pride at being one step closer to the end goal.  Enjoy the trek at your pace and savour the experience. It’s not a race to get to the next tea house but a journey to enjoyed and experienced. Acclimitisation is important on the trek and can be done easily by following a comfortable pace and keeping yourself hydrated.A word of advice: Please do prepare adequately for the trek as it is a strenuous one. We started our preparation for the trek around 6 months before, doing both cardio and muscle strengthening exercises.Nepal Vision was our chosen travel partner for the EBC trek and they fulfilled all our expectations. A well-executed trip with every detail taken care of. A very good and patient manager, Chet, who answered all our queries before the trek, giving us the comfort and confidence required. A fantastic, helpful and knowledgeable guide in Keshar and a wonderfully helpful and always smiling Sherpa in Tek Rai made our experience even more memorable. We have been able to reach EBC only because of the subtle motivation and  constant encouragement provided by Keshar. The day we were supposed to fly out from Lukhla, all flights were cancelled. After waiting for hours at the airport, our guide Keshar, managed a helicopter ride from Lukhla to Phakding at no extra cost to us. This was another feather in the cap for Keshar and Nepal vision.  The apples that they served us after every dinner was really relished here and sometimes the only meal that we had.Thank you Chet, Keshar and Tek Rai for taking care of us and making our trip memorable.Read more about it on https://aztravellog.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/steps-to-heaven/"
What a view...!,"Great trip to Base Camp. Fascinating culture, great challenge and of course the views were breathtaking. I used Private Expeditions, who were absolutely faultless. Everything from collecting from the airport, hiring any gear, but most importantly the guides and staff out there were just incredible. If you are thinking of going to Base Camp (and you should!!) use Private Expeditions as they were awesome!"
"Annapurna Foothills - professional, reliable and personable approach","We participated in 4 day Lobuche East guided climb with Annapurna Foothills. From the initial contact, throughout the time leading to our trip, Ngima was very helpful, timely and patient with responses to all our enquiries. The trip itself was very well organized, we were looked after exceptionally well by our guides Nawang and Pasang. Food was abundant and delicious, climbing instructions were clear and gear fairly new. We had 100% confidence in our guide's abilities and felt safe at all times throughout the climb.We had a great time climbing the peak and would recommend this adventure with Annapurna Foothills to everyone!"
Hallelujah!,What a thrill! Making it to Everest Base Camp was a hallelujah moment. Cannot even imagine what making it to/from the top would be like. The sky was crystal blue and the excitement of the expedition preparation overwhelming. Go For It!
