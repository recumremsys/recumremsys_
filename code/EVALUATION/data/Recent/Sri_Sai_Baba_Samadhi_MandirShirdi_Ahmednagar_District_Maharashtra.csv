Sai Baba Samadhi Sthal,"Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir complex is spread over huge area. Overall well managed temple. Due to heavy rush of devotee from all over India, it takes long hour to stand in queue for darshan. Need to improve some facility for those who are standing in queue. ViP pass facility is available here for those who wish to bypass long queue.       You feel divine and blessed at this place.   Lots of hotel and guest houses are  available for stay in shirdi .…"
Religious Trip ,No one words can express the feeling that one can have after Baba'a darshan at the mandir. I feel lucky that my visit went smoothly. Not much crowd. Could say my prayers comfortably. The whole premise is beautiful. 
Om sai !! Divine & blissful,"Most of us knows about Sai baba of shirdi. Sai bab samadhi temple is situated in shirdi almost 75 km from Nashik. It is co0nnected by road to Mumbai and train also stop here. It has airport but check connectivity.

Good road will bring you to town.  Don't fall pry to agents. Everything is very smooth. There are different gates to enter. Check your entry point. Sai nath samadhi temple is very beautiful and very well maintained and located in the heart of town. You can buy VIP ticket also costing Rs400/- per person . Else you need to wait in queue which will keep you for almost 3-4 hours waiting. In case you take VIP pass it will bypass normal entry adn within 30 minutes or so you have baba darshan. Be careful when you buy offering for Baba, don't forget to bargain or they may cheat you. Lot of devotees visit this temple throughout the year. On every Thursday large number of devotees visit temple so better you avoid or you have to wait long in queues. Temple is very well maintained and discipline is followed by all. You feel divine and blessed at this place. visiting this place since 2003 and seen lot many construction , hotels, shops, restaurants coming up. You come out of the temple in the mid of market where you can buy prasad, souvenir etc. Paid Parking facility is available just opposite to the entry gate, its underground , you may ask shopkeepers they will guide you. Hotels suiting all pockets are available in plenty. Don't forget to buy Laddoo prasad for your family and friends. Its available just outside exit gate. You may have to wait in queue but worth waiting. Market is narrow and crowded be careful of your bags and pockets. Better if you reach early morning. Photography is not allowed inside the temple. Bags and purses also need to kept outside.  Very peaceful and blissful place. Must visit in case you are around this place.…"
Awesome and blissful ,"It was just awesome visiting temple. Attended all artis. We were really blessed to be able to attend Artis  with His Divine Blessings, Artis were well organized and performed. Dwarkamai and maruti mandir was also grate... Om Sai Ram!"

Very serene place,"One of the best places to visit. Very serene environment. Don't fall for touts, mandir trust has good facilities for darshan,  senior citizens can get free darshan pass once during day. Also anyone can go to PRO counter and get pass for Rs. 200."
Holy place in the earth,"I am not qualified to describe Sai Baba Mandir, I am a lay person before him. but still I take this as his blessing to share my thoughts on this temple. This is the holiest place in earth. Such a divinity and happiness you can't find in any other place. The administration works…"
Sai Darshan,Sri Sai Baba Samadhi mandir situatie on main highway .Mandir is very espacios.A large number of people from all corner of india daily visit the temple for sai baba's darshan.Sai sansthan has made very good arrangements for darshan.
A must see in Shirdi,"The mandir complex is a huge structure and the number of visitors everyday is unthinkable. It may be said that the crowd is well managed, but the wait time is too long. The authority should pay some attention to provide some resting place to the tired visitors. For a first time…"
Get vip pass to enter if you can ,VIP pass is better than the online pass as it’s almost in the Samadhi mandir else now the online pass is easily available and the queue is huge and with kids it becomes very difficult however if baba has called you he will bless you always.
Family Trip to Shirdi from Hyderabad,"I went for a 3 day trip from Hyderabad to Shirdi and other near by places.Started Monday night,returned to Hyderabad on Saturday Morning. While going AC sleeper from Orange travels (Cost per ticket around 1500), boarded bus in front of Asian Mall near BHEL @ 09:50 PM. Bus came on time, slept well and was dropped in Shridi around 8:00 am.Auto wala took 60 rupees from location i was dropped to Golden View hotel. Bus is awesome, no complains. They gave water bottle and a snack.Golden View Hotel - I used Agoda online app to book room (Deluxe Triple Bed), it costed me 2350 per day. I recently returned from USA, to me this hotel is clean and good, i would not say wow, awesome crazy buzz words but i liked staying with my family (we are 4, 2 kids less than 11 years and me, my wife). The main advantage, this hotel is right in front of Template, we saved lot of time and felt safe my wife going alone for shopping and returning to room. Hotel rating 4/5.Food - There is a hotel right in front of Golden view hotel (sorry forgot name), note it is not below golden view, it is good, will rate 4/5 and best hotel was woodlands, you have to walk like quater KM from this hotel, it is 4.5/5. Dominos pizza was nice, 4.25/5, it is right infront of golden view."
Getting popular in recent years,"Popular pilgrim destination. Shirdi was less popular a few years back. But off late it has become more popular and is attracting more visitors annually. The temple trust has started providing online service to book accommodation, darshan and aarti ticekts."
Holy place,A very holy place located in Maharashtra. Unfortunately it has become very commerciallised. The Sansthan is doing a good job of coping up with the ever increasing crowd.
Om sai ram,I love sai Baba I every month go shirdi is palace of sai Baba samdhai mandir every thing is available food hotel bus train om sai ram jai sai baba
Awful Blessings n Greattt Temple,I have visited quite a few temples across India but the kind of arrangements here forces us to think how civilized are we. Excellent cleanliness across temple and lovely prasad too.
Kakad Aarti,Went for Kakad Aarti Darshan.  Very good Darshan I had.  So peaceful and quiet.  Nicely maintained the place.
One of the most systematically manage temple,Went for darshan in Jan 2020. I have booked VIP pass but due to flight rescheduled reach one day later. Find a booking counter for VIP pass at airport and get passes from there. You cant enter with mobile and shoes bit there are counters to store it or else you can deposit with shop keepers which is risky. VIP pass will help you to skip a long que all will meet at the main hall. A great place
Blessed to visit Baba's Samadhi Mandir.,No words can describe the visit to Samadhi Mandir. I wish I could come here again and again to seek Baba's Blessings. Om Sai Ram
Sacred n Divine! ,"This is my Mecca! You are lucky, if you get a chance to visit Shirdi! You would need to do your passes upfront in advance, which may be done online. Try spending time, going at different places with temple complex, after darshan to soak in the vibes."
Annual Pilgrimage,Blissful prayers at Mandir. Kakad arti was crowded . Crowd is increasing yearly . Temples complex is very clean. Don’t be cheated by any touts. Obtain VIP pass from PRO office
complete bliss,"The resting place of Sai Baba. Thousands of visitors and despite the rush and chaos, one feels bliss and happiness and realize their wishes according to their faith. Wish there was a more systematic way to line the devotees and control darshan time so everyone benefits."
om sai ram,"sai baba resides here and gives his presence here.u can visit whole premises and there are many food places here,many hotels near by.u can book online ur visit and hotel."
sai baba mandir shirdi,"The sai baba samadhi mandir is very well managed by the management to ensure there is no cause of discomfort for the thousands of devotees who visit the mandir for darsan every day. the premises is clean, darsan timings properly maintained and volunteers are very helpful.

SAI SAMADHI MANDIR,Tremendous power and satisfaction you can feel when you are in the front Shree SAI BABA.  Good time to visit during Dec to Feb every year.
Very famous temple,This is very famous temple of Shree Sai Baba.  Many devotees came daily. Nice arrangement for Darshan. Good for visit.
God,I darshan shri sai baba of mandir is morning is kata artri and also evening is time morning 4.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. jai sai baba

Divine and Sublime.,"Samadhi Mandir has the magnetic Divine presence of bhagwan Sai baba.As the presence of Baba envelopes the location one feels comforted.The Sansthan is doing excellent efforts to manage the crowd.We could get the special darshan in about half an hour's time.jai Sai Ram.After stepping out from the main hall,one can visit the Chavadi,Dwarakamai,Hanuman temple and the museum."
Temple with great  healing powers,As devotee visiting since 1958 . Earlier with parents & used to stay inside temple as lodges were not available till 1970 .We used to sit near samadhi & do Pooja ourselves .Due to the power of the temple thousands visit daily &Today we cant stand more than few seconds near the corridor .I visit regularly to thank SAIBABA for his support & grace on our family.
Sri Sai Baba Samadhi Visit - Underwhelming,"We left Mumbai at 5am for Shirdi as we were making day trip for a darshan. Journey started with the driver who seemed to be in a hurry. Honking, over-taking and risk taking, texting, talking on mobiles is considered acceptable. Due to the road conditons, the bypass which the driver took, made it a longer trip.  With god's grace we arrived safely at the mandir. Its seems their are people who are out to make money from anyone who looks like that they are from aboard. VIP Pass, buy this offering and or flowers, pushed from one to another corner.  Having been there once now. I will advise anyone who wants to for a darshan, is to take no offering.  The gatekeepers, shouldnt allow devotees to push and shove, walk in a orderly manner and get the few minutes of darshan time without the noise and clutter. They should control the number of people that go in and allow time for the others to come out in a mannerly fashion.  Overall if it wasnt for the pushing and shoving and for a driver who drives crazily, the experience can be amazing. Maybe it was my way of getting the awakening with Baba at Shirdi, With better crowd control and planning by the authorities and the 'guides' stop trying to make money by being aggressive, and the security guards stop saying 'move, move, move', the devotees could all have a great personal enlightenment."
"Trip from Delhi to Shirdi on December  31, 2019.","Hi friends,I would just want to share my experience of shirdi trip from DELHI. Thanks for your reviews it helped a lot.I have started my trip on 31st December 2019,from Dwarka, Delhi at 6.00 am. I reached Jaipur at 9.30,than reached bondi by Ajmer Highway at 2:00pm.than we reached neemuch by chhitorgarh highway near about 6.30pm.Than Ratlam by 10:00pm and than Mumbai highway and reached shirdi by 4:30am in morning. We celebrated new year at Mumbai highway.Excellent roads but too much toll. Road was not good from Mumbai expressway to shirdi. But one can opt for road trip to shirdi, beautiful sceneries and safe way.Regards AMIT ARORA"
Inner Peace,Been at the temple in November 2019.  Feeling of inner peace after the visit.  The only drawback is long queues and people has no manners in a temple as such.  They push and behaviour of people is a nightmare.  I attended the night dharsan and morning aarti.  Will definitely visit again.
Divine....,Beautiful temple. Little crowded but temple committee arranged so many tea / coffee counter. Like tirupathi we have to stand in a long queue to visit. Minimum 2 hours to maximum 5 hours required to see the main god. Please carry snacks and other required thing for children.
Nice visit,Nice visit to Shirdi Sai temple. Everything is well organized inside the temple so that no issues caused to devotees
A wonderful experience,The Rs 200 spent to get a quick Darshan was worth it. The feeling of being right there and getting darshan is very difficult to explain in words. Do make your way to the Langar as well. Pay the Rs 50 for the special experience. Sai Baba visit at Shridi is worth the hassle to get there.
Divine place,This is the heavenly abode on earth.  Lord Saibaba the Universe and the Ultimate himself has lived in this place for long. Must visit.
Positive vibes,"It’s been 7-8 years , before my visit to baba happened and was actually tired after a road trip of 10 hours but some how felt the energy back once I entered the premises of Mandir. There are always positive vibes in holy places and this is no different . Quite heavy rush on Saturday night but were lucky to get a good dharshan ."
Peaceful,Its a pleasure for me and thanks to shirdi people who made this beatiful place. I had darshan within thirty minutes only.
Peace,"This Temple is very very beautiful, The temple is always filled with people still you will feel the inner peace.Sai Mandir is one of the most famous place in India. Must visit guys"
Divine!!,Mesmerising positivity reflected in the temple.Had been here in the month of September.We had booked the special darshan ticket online .The Temple surroundings are well maintained.We need to handover our mobile phones in the counters outside the temple.The temple atmosphere is blissful with people singing aartis of Saibaba and chantings.All in all a divine experience!
Blissful and Relaxed,Went with family and friends. We had booked special Darshan tickets and for Abhishekam Pooja. The crowd was not too high even though it was Wednesday-Thursday. We had a relaxed and blissful Darshan. Very well managed queue system. 
Divine ,This temple has excellent vibes. The idol is life like and mersmerising.  Good securtiy and well organised 
Beautiful and divine,The temple and surrounding areas are very well maintained and organised. The online registration for Darshan is very convenient. Serene ambience with lot of neem banyan and other trees. Drinking water facilities available. The Lendi garden in the temple premises is lovely. A…
Bliss,"A proof of belief can cure anything can be felt here with Baba blessing all and seems to be here always. Very well managed queue , please book aarthi darshan as you can experience about 30 mins of pure bliss. Om Sairam. Will make you come again."
The eternal truth,"What can I write about the sai mandir at shridi when you reach there you forget everything,  you are only in thought of baba and nothing else , very few and lucky people reach there"
Road Trip from Ahmedabad to Shirdi,"Planned a road trip to Shirdi from Ahmedabad with the wife. The journey can be broken down in 2 parts: 1. Till Gujarat border2. MaharashtraTill Gujarat border (Dharampur to be precise) the roads are smooth. Reached Valsad in 4 hours flat travelling at speeds of 110 kmph (also less traffic in morning was a factor).The moment you reach Maharashtra, the roads are horrible till Nashik. Nashik to Shirdi is still a better highway. But the natural beauty is a sight to behold in Maharashtra & that was worth the road trip. They can market these places near Nashik & make it a great tourist hub if they wish to.Tip for road travel: Fill your tank in Gujarat to the brim before entering Maharashtra & by the time you visit & return, you'd still have fuel. This will help you save as the difference in pricing is almost 9 Rs/liter.We took night halt at St. Laurn Shirdi, went to the temple in morning at 7:30 & sought blessings from Sai Baba. The VIP pass is only to help reach faster till the entrance of the temple. Too much commercialization has made the temple lose its charm that's what i felt.To summarize:A road trip is worth if you truly love nature. The Ghats & the terrain in Maharashtra are delight to watch.Visit Trimbak & Shirdi for a truly devotional experience. Trimbak gives you peace & serenity & Shirdi Sai Baba temple shows how loved Sai Baba is."
Just positive vibes,One can truely feel positivity and calmness in the temple. Beautiful temple where u can sit and relax in their lawn area. Though u just get few seconds of glimpses of Sai Baba at main temple .
Worship ,On line booking for darshan gives extra pleasure. Less Q.Even without booking I have gone to get darshan of SAI BABA.it is awesome excellent experience for me & my family
Sri Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir,I visit the Sai Baba temple in the month of march.The temple is well decorated with gold. There is que  to go inside the temple. It takes approx 1-2 hours for visiting .The temple is also so beautiful.
Blessed by Baba!!,"Sri Sai Baba mandir is the 2nd popular pilgrimage destination after Tirupati Balaji. Once you enter the main gabhara,all the pain you had standing in the long ques is out of mind.Divine Intervention. Avoid going on Sundays, Public holidays & Thursday if you want to avoid rush."
Peaceful,Peaceful place huge sis baba blessing place visit every time at the place of sai baba place. We were very happy
Blessed ,"Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir is the scared place where you have long queues if you are visiting on Thursday. If you are coming by flight take a cab from Shirdi airport, minimum charges for 4+1 passenger for sedan is Rs 600. They will drop you anywhere in Shirdi.  Go to Sai baba site…"
Visit Sai Mandir,Breathtaking experience. Each person has to be there to experience it. It's a beautiful holy place. Om SaiRam.
Shirdi ke Sai Baba,"The sai baba temple has some divine energy, and one can feel it you visit. Even though lot of crowd, once you come near daity we feel profound experience. Great temple, my 5 stars for this."
A spiritual connection,"The Sai Mandir in Shirdi is visited by a lot of devotees. It is better to take an online ticket for darshan,aarti and rooms by visiting the website.  One has to carry the online printout with id proof mentioned at the time of booking.  One has to enter the temple through the…"
bliss,lucky enough to touch the feet of samadhi!! Also lucky enough to get the offerings back after blessing of baba!
Peace of Mind ,Do visit on Kojagiri Pournima night Sej Aarti in main mandir .... Mesmerising experience!!! The pooja lasted for 2 hours from 11pm to 1am. Book on line tickets .. Go by air as Shridi Airport is operational and spend more time with baba.  Note- Fresh Ladu prasad is made available…
Nothing in front of divinity.,"Though baba is omni present but there is a special aura to this place, you actually feel Sai baba with you. Try This mesmarising experiance once and you will want comming here again and again."
Peace,We did Darshan of baba at the morning and it was very peaceful place which I observed.next visit will be in Jan.
peaceful,Avoid queus and you can get VIP darshan passes from PRO offices. Lots of small temples in the compound. The hanuman mandir is very special and must not miss
Clean and Peaceful,"Been with parents to the place. Filled with surprises, the place was clean and lot of shops ( standard tourist place bargaining skills needed). People are nice and you will get a good food. Dont take chances for your regional food preference, Try the local food, its good and best to take in travel. Temple is quite small, including dwarka, not over expect but its corridors\ boundaries had expanded. Must bring back - take aways --> Ash from immortal flames in dwarka that is neither hot nor smokes, a bite of the neem leaves that is not bitter like you get at other places. WE had been in middle of rainy season so not much of hovering around.One cautionary note, dont opt for the Kakad arathi if you have elders or kids. Its not worth the money or blessing. 3 hrs of waiting in long queue and 45 mins in standing for dharsan. You need to try your luck not to get a pillar view or someone is in middle."
Awesome Place...!,"Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir its awesome place had very good dharshan.Experience that we faced in shiridiWe booked cab from Airport -> Shiridi ( Approx 16 Kms ) , and they charge 600 INR for one way. Cab driver was so helpful and politely treated us ( his name is Balasaheb Sonawane - 09604041241) and we booked same cab for return also.where we booked ticket both dharshan (9Pm Dharshan) and aarthi (6.30Pm arthi booked).We stayed in G Square just opposite to Sai Baba temple(Pro office gate). Its nice place to stay but i felt its over priced but its opposite to temple. 3 pair of new footwear missing we dint keep footwear in clock room due to time constraint we left footwear near to PRO gate where it was stolen - recommended to not wear footwear to temple either leave footwear in clock room. that guys taking only new footwearsHere come about Aarthi - we had bad experience We booked 7.00 Pm aarthi and in ticket reporting time mentioned as 6.30Pm near to PRO office. We reached there by 6.35 but they said you missed aarthi. bcoz of this we lost 3 pair of new footwears.We got to see few security ppls where they helped us to had aarthi by 10.30Pm by changing the time  . Mean time we had dharshan ticket for 9.00 Pm we use same time ticket and had dharshan by 7.00Pm itself.Again we come to ticket counter and change the aarthi time to 10.30 Pm here we got few information why we missed 7.00Pm aarthi.Reason :1.Reporting time mentioned in ticket as 6.30Pm for 7.00 Pm Aarthi but actually we should report by 5.00 pm or 5.30 Pm. 2.For 10.30 Pm aarthi we get in Q at 8.30 Pm itself . So if you book for aarthi be there 2 hrs before.3.Aarthi its was crowded where ppls standing front Q only can see baba in while they doing aarthiThis was experience which we faced so i want others to know the rules so that you can get baba blessing little early and without facing any problems. OM SAI Ram"
Neatly maintained Temple.,"Please do online booking for hassle free and for quick darshan. You can book for darshan, aarti and Puja by online with time and date. I booked the slot 4.00 p.m. and entered by 3.30 p.m. and came out around 4.15 p.m. The temple is maintained neatly with many volunteers. When you come out you will get neatly packed prasad."
Jai Sairam--Shirdi Baba,"Must visit Temple.Good vibes will flow during the visit,  Very religious and soul purifying place. Devotees from far distance places come here and seek Blessings. There are separate lines for free Dharshan and online booking.Nowadays biometric process is prevalent. So take your Aadhaar card as age & address proof for the biometric entry pass and enter according to the time slot, after that it might take 2 hours maximum, during lean rush.The queue lines were very well planned where we find seats every few steps forward. Milk and biscuits also available.No mobiles or electronic devices allowed in the premises. A number of good hotels nearby. Well connected by roads. There is good option to stay in Temple Trust Sai Ashram as the Price is just 500 rs for AC room per day. Best Place to Silent your Mind --The moment you look towards the deity you feel like your wishes would be accomplished. Try to visit once in your lifetime."
Sai Baba Darshan,We reached temple early in the morning and attended the Kakad Aarti.There was a long queue for Darshan and we had to wait almost 2 hours for our tur.But finally after Darshan we forgot everything and it was all about the divine and pure atmosphere inside the temple
A PEACEFUL PLACE,"very calm and nice place of Baba, very well arrangement and crowd management in spite of huge rush. A very peaceful place"
Excellent,Visit was very nice neat and clean place me and my friend did Sai Baba darshan and take Prasad from there.
Peace at baba s feet,"The peace u feel seeing the gigantic but at the same time sweet n pleasant baba is out of the world. The crowd, the chaotic surroundings really doesnt bother u as you really get overwhelmed by his very presence 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 om sai ram."
Aum SAI Ram,"Have visited temple in first week of September. By SAI baba's blessings I was able to get Darshan of baba. Have gone there by train and alighted at Belapur(shrirampur) BAP railway station. It took 1 hr from there but cabs are a bit difficult to get. Autos are there but make sure to do a lot of bargaining and better take auto outside the station. Please get a hotel nearby temple as it will be a lot easier for everything like visiting temple, getting cabs to diff places and also a lot of restaurants."
Amazing visit to the masters abode ,We visited the temple a week ago and carry pleasant memories to date. Its a fulfilling experience to say the least.  Do visit and get your hearts desires fulfilled in the lords grace.
Devine,You pour your heart out too baba and he will definently answer your prayer that's the feeling you get once you lean in front of the samadhi.
Always worth visiting,I am a big devotee of Sai Baba and do not leave any opportunity to visit this beautiful place. The management is very good. They have well managed the big crowd visiting temple.
Saibaba temple,"Must see in lifetime.everything is so systematic and smooth unlike other religious shrines.can't be described in words, has to be felt."
Shirdi trip,"A walking distance to Samadhi Mandir.Even I forgot to tell them to give me wake up call for Kakad Arati next morning,the staff called to room and asked whether I need wake up call for next morning.Really appreciated your kind thoughts.Great job"
Delightful experience @ Sri Sai Baba Samadhi MAndir,"I visited Sai Baba Mandir in August and it was totally delightful experience. It was the month of August last year and when I reached it started raining and it continued for almost two days. So, it is my personal advice that whenever u plan to visit in August, just make arrangements to deal with continous rains in this area. Although, the rains makes the weather quite pleasant. I visited thrice @ the Samadhi to take the blessings in a day. Visiting the mandir, took me to scroll the pages of history which I have seen on TV or read in books. Really Delightful.Don't miss the Darshan of Shree Shani Shingnapur whenever u visit Shirdi. Much more ...............will discuss later."

Really exlent no words to say....,Sai baba samadhi mandir really expect. Am going darshanam thusday evging baba pallaki seva thay do every thusdsy.
Must include in Shirdi trip ,One should visit it after completion of Sai Baba darshan. It is easier to reach by taking exit from Gate 3 of Sai Baba temple.Devotees certainly pay a visit here to complete there Shirdi darshan.
“incredible”,Visited first time amzing experience. approach to the temple was narrow and dusty with hawkers all around. The darshan was good as there was not much of crowd due to rains. We took a special darshan ticket but there were no volunteers anywhere to escort you. This paid line ultimately goes and joins dharam darshan But the temple was very well kept now. They have built a wall all around the property and it is guarded throughout.
Emperor of the Universe or Akhilanda Brmhanda Nayaka,"I visit every year and it is never satisfying to see the Lord. There is a prebooking of Aarti and darshans online which can be purchased for making the darshan comfortable. If you are NRI/central govt or state govt employee, tickets can be obtained by showing the passport or ID cards incase the online darshan tickets are not available."
incredible,incredible experience and awesome darshan of baba. My first visit to shirdi was a memorable experience
RESTING PLACE FOR A HOLY SAINT,After a gap of 20 years i have visited this place. That time the approach to the temple was narrow and dusty with hawkers all around. The darshan was good as there was not much of crowd due to rains. We took a special darshan ticket but there were no volunteers anywhere to escort you. This paid line ultimately goes and joins dharam darshan But the temple was very well kept now. They have built a wall all around the property and it is guarded throughout.
The Best!,Excellent arrangements. However the Pujaris need to be more courteous towards devotees. Winter visit is best in terms of weather.
Not upto my expectations,"I was planning this trip since long. I applied online for VIP Darshan. And when actually we entered the temple premises,  we were made to walk considerable distance ( we are senior citizens) and had to wait for almost an hour and we could stand in front of main statue for just 5 seconds. I don't know how much time people stand in queue for normal Darshan but I was disappointed after paying 200 rupee for VIP Darshan. Om Sai Ram"
My Holy trip to this temple,"If You believe in Sai Baba and visited this Temple you knew it what it feels inside the Samadhi Mandir. If you visit during the weekend, Thursday or any festival, you will see very long queues for hours. Good thing is that inside in queue you can watch live telecast in TV. Inside the Mandir Sai Baba, the body is resting and you will feel his presence. Don't bring anything inside you go for Shej Aarti."
Divine Place,"This shrine is very popular among Sri Satya Sai followers in India and abroad. Advance booking absolutely required. Mobile and bags not allowed inside Non commercial, peaceful temple once we get inside. Photos of exteriors and car park area only."
Sai Samadhi Mandir,I'm visiting here continuously since eight years every Gurupoornima day and my new year starts from hear on Jan 1St every year only after taking blessings from SAI. Each time when I visit here a new experience. Samadhi mandir Baba's body rested and white marble idol with temple…
Gives u the peace of mind,Went for a darshan on Wednesday late evening and was so happy that we could finish within 1 1/2 hrs. We took the paid darshan so it was even more easier. Loads of crowd but worth everything. 
Om Sai Ram,"Its a Holy place, just went there to take blessing of Sai Baba. Jai Sai Ram. We have purchased VIP entry tickets (Rs200/- per head) so don't have to wait long in queues for darshan. We will again soon."

Darsan ,We are two me and my friend our Darsan was good no long que within 20 min. Our Darsan has completed.
"Experience Baba's Omnipresence, plus how he answers devotee's sincere prayer defying Space-time continnum","Many people would ask - why bother to queue up / complete with annoying crowd / stand in line for hours just for a few seconds of Darshan? One of my own friend even complained that, there isn't enough time to talk to Baba, because everyone only has a few seconds there.  The…"
Inconvenience,Cleanliness is an issue and no assistance or signage to the respective areas. There are touts and guides flooding the space just to fool visitors and make money. Trust me one needs no guide just ask the people around and follow instructions. Another problem is due indefinite…
Shirdi Sai Temple,"Om Sai Ram....just thinking that what Can I possibly write about this Divine place? BABA's teachings of shraddha & saburi....it is a divine place...very peaceful....just wish that we all be blessed by His Grace...I think if we get a chance to visit here,we are really lucky..."

it is a pilgrimage every sai devotee should embark upon,there are many good hotels available at a very reasonable rates close to samadi mandir. deovtees should visit shani shinglapur also else the pilgrimage is not complete.
Religious trip,"Nice divine experience ,must for every Shirdi visitor ,highly recommended ,God bless all ,allah maalik"
Fabulous trip ,This hotel is one of the best hotel in Shirdi. Staff here is amazingly friendly and courteous. Specially the owner Mr Dilip and the manager Mr Ranjan Pattanayak. I enjoyed every bit of my stay here. Hotel has nice in house restaurant. And they have a 24hrs vehicle which is for free pick up and drop between hotel and temple.
Samadhi mandir,"Unlike other pilgramages, very organised, systematically managed crowd of devotees.. may be this is best time as you don't find too many devotees in shirdi during this period..this makes your visit more purposeful..you get to spend more time in the temple near BABA JI'SHRINE.."
They say baba has to call,"It was our sudden decision to visit the abode of Baba. Got booking for stay and darshan through online ashram website. We travelled from Bangalore by evening flight to Mumbai. The plan was to catch the night sleeper bus at 10.45 pm from Sahara signal. Since that was not possible, we booked taxi through MakeMyTrip (MMT). I slept for few hours, and my husband kept talking to the driver to keep him awake. It took us around 6 hrs to reach the Ashram guest house. It was amazing to find the coordination there between staff and devotees. People who could not efford a room, also were welcome under a permanent shed with washrooms nearby in the campus. There were regular buses plying from guest houses to the main temple, and railway station. Eventhough we were there on a thursday, the crowd was not so much, or we couldnot sense it as they were managed through various gates. It took us an hour overall for the darshan. Our MMT driver, also paid a visit to baba. He mentioned he was sort of dreaming about baba, and that he was getting calls from Shirdi couple of days before he got the booking. And was very happy about the coincidence. We were happy that despite a delay in our flight, we were lucky enough to go ahead with the plan of visiting Baba at Shirdi."
When you lack happiness in life visit to re-live!,"Awesomely cleaned place however some devotees(if you want to call them devotees) Cannot stay without having paan or masala and without spitting! One can book all the Darshan,Pooja and Aarti through online! Beautifully managed crowd by their security!If you wish to do Pooja or…"
Must visit for Sai devotees,Holy place for Sai devotees. Must visit Baba Aartis and darshan. We can book online in advance n have peaceful darshan.
Good temple ,You need to book pre darshan line of gate no. 3 if you want took darshan fast. Temple does not allow mobile and cra inside. Inside temple management is good but not outside.
Shri Shirdi Sai Baba Darshan,"One of the best experiences in terms of Darshan.   Wise to register online for darshan slot through Sansthans app or website.  Nominal Rs 200 slot booking charges for regular visit. Please check updated fees.   I had booked 4pm, 2May, Thursday Darshan & already completed by…"

Peaceful place,People are good and so is the arrangement at the temple. This is the major attraction point at Shirdi.
Maha Gurudev temple with very good vibrations.. ,"Do you want to feel yourself immersed in mental Relief and joy..  Then this is the place for you.. Gurusansthans like this place are not visited by all.. The persons who Come here are allowed to enter only after the permission of the Gurumaharaj...So, just pray to Saibaba to call you to visit the Mandir he lives even today.. Surely, your prayers will be answered and you will surely visit this place to get the blessings of Saibaba.. Nothing more to say.. Come by his invitation and feel Blessed..."
Poweful and peaceful ,"One must visit here once in life! Waiting for Darshan took me 5 hours, but it was absolutely worth to do it! One local told me from Thursday until Sunday afternoon is much more crowded (means from Sunday evening will be less crowd). There are many spots are so powerful and have space to meditate, ex.Guru Sthan, Majid (Dwaraka Mai), four devotees' samadhis who served Baba before (when enter Gate No.4, direct way and see this four samadhis)."
DARSHAN,We had made the booking in advance on line. No difficulty in reaching. Enter during the time slot allotted. Had nice Darshan of Baba and came out in less then 30 minutes.Felt blessed.
Visit to Shirdi Sai Baba Temple,"We had visited Shirdi Sai Baba temple on 18th April post booking Rs 200 ticket online. We directly went to Gate 4 (called as Shani gate). Before entering deposit Mobile phone and slippers in the outside counters. Post entering from gate 4, we proceeded through gate 3 and stood in the line. We need not depend on any agents standing outside the gates to visit the temple."
OM SAI RAM,Always SAI RAM... Just Keep looking at BABA because he will be looking at you.You will get lot of peace once you enter into the Sai Baba Mandir.
For pligrimage purpose.,I strongly believe that all must visit this place for prayers. One can always seek blessings of Shirdi Sai Baba
BABA's BLESSINGS,Om Sai RamWe have been visiting Shirdi regularly from many years..this time it was very convenient to travel as we have a direct flight from Delhi as the Airport has started in Shirdi (although small as of now)  but  very comfortable....the main temple is just 20 minutes drive by cab from the airport of Shirdi.....the place is well maintained by Sansthan as usual ... once we reach near temple although very crowded but still we feel very peaceful .... feel like coming again and again ASAP...
Must visit once ,"It is one of the best temple to visit. This Sai temple is world famous and it is one of the richest temples, where people donate to their best capacity.If you visit on special days like thursday or purnima or some special festivals, than please make up ur mind and body for long ques. If I mean long than it is too long. Approx waiting time is 3-4hours in que, even getting VIP pass @200rs per person also makes u wait for atleast 1-2 hours. I only have one advise for temple authorities that either they should not accept any offerings like garland or sweets, or if they accept than they should not throw on floor just to move the que faster. It might surt someone's sentiments. One of the unique things I saw while standing in que is that people can buy water, juice or food while waiting in the que and there are fans overhead which helps people from heat. One of the most important things that the security is very laid back and non attentive, i was feeling fool by keeping my iphone in locker as I saw many people carrying it with them. Also If you are in a que and the time runs around 12pm than Ola...!! you have to wait for additional 40-45 minute till the prayer (aarti) gets over. So plan it accordingly. God Bless...!!"
sai baba temple,very famous temple and very crowded. take a vip pass for 200 each and may be you can get dashan early. otherwise very famous temple
A must see for every Believers,"Being a Sai baba devotee, I travel to this place at least once a year  and this is happening for last 10 years."
Main highlight of Shirdi though very crowded,"Sai Baba Mandir is the main attraction of Shirdi and everyone comes here from around the country to get blessings. Following points should be noted while going to the mandir:1. There are 3 types of entries in the complex for Darshan :a) Free - Avoid this if you dont want to stand in line for 3-4 hrs !b) VIP pass - This costs 200 bucks per head. During a rush hour, it takes 20-30 min in the line to get VIP pass and another 20-30 min waiting in the line for Darshan. For VIP pass, you need an ID proof like driving licensec) Senior citizen pass - it takes around 10 min in the line to get senior citizen pass. The counter is situated near gate no. 3. You are eligible for this pass if you are above 60yrs of age. If you are above 70yrs, then a free pass for attendant is allowed. Carry your age proof2. VIP pass for Darshan can also be booked online which would save your 20 min in line3. Booking for Aarti is done months in advance. So, if you are interested in Aarti, then book it 2-3 months before your travel4.Entry for VIP pass people is at gate no. 1. If you have a senior citizen pass, you can enter Gate no. 3 which is comparatively closer.5. During rush hour, you would get only few seconds to see sai baba statue before being pushed out through the exit. So, try to plan your visit during early morning or evening"
Family trip for sai darshan,Very well managed & maintained saibaba samadhi mandir. Beautiful temple & serene place. Temple and it's surroundings are very clean & well maintained. Jai sai ram
Gurur Pranam,Great worship.  Preparation for Rama Navami Festival is going on.  Magal Sabathi house is Very near to Temple.  It has got a Gallery also.
Well organised and seamless,"Shirdi Sai Baba trust has managed to make the access as organised as possible. They have put up sign boards every where for easy Darshan, senior citizens, handicapped, vip passes and across various gates. So if u have patience to read and understand a bit then you don't need any agents/touts helping you with getting in. Very clean and smooth most times of the day and night.TIP : Please avoid shopkeepers approaching you for taking care of your shoes/phone etc as on that pretext they will take around 10 bucks per shoe/phone plus coerce you to buy Pooja samagri from them and almost embarass you to buy till you agree for something. Completely avoidable as the Mandir has arranged every possible facility including phone, shoes and easy access for paid and unpaid Darshan .Jai Shri Sai Ram!"
Baba,Peaceful place good facility all over good place to visit to take baba lessing.must to visit to take baba blessing.
Great,Great Place. we feel comfertable there. and not a long queue. everyone was enjoying the every moemnt.
Shirdi Sai,A holy place with lots of vibration.Peaceful admosphere with lots of people of different states of India.'Sai Maharaj ki Jay' is the only slogan from each and every one there.
Pilgrimage ,Very soul satisfying. Expect ctowds. Taxing for senior citizens specially those not in good physical health.
द्वारकामाई,Excellent arrangementSystem oriented workBehaviour of guards superbOverall management goodArrange watercolor
Not what I was expecting,"I expected tranquility, calm and peace at such a holy place but all I felt was harassed. On our first day, we just wanted to look around and take in the divine presence of Sai Baba but literally every step we took people were trying to sway us to buy tickets or prayer goods. It…"
Temple of different type ,Nicely maintained Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir. Different type of feelings came when we visited this place 
DIVINE BLISS,"I visited Shirdi after a gap of over 30 years and was amazed at the total transformation of the place. What was once a sleepy, quiet hamlet is now a bustling town, teeming with pilgrims and with Hotels and restaurants of all shapes, sizes and price ranges. The main attraction…"
Something Magical Place,We visited the Temple after wiring  for long time. With Foreign passport we were in short que. Worth a visit but to pray we felt rushed all the way. Donations were received but really felt uncomfortable as they started as if It was thrown in a heap. Prayers coupons were given…
Well maintained place,Took a bus from Nashik to shirdi. Buses to shirdi starts from Mahamarg bus stand(Bombay nakka) in Nashik and ticket costs Rs 130 per person.Journey takes about 1.45 -2 hours. The buses stop at the the place from where we can go for darshan of Sai baba(Shirdi bus stand is about 1…
VERY ORGANISED,Quite clean...very organised..do not fall for the hawkers.go atleart 1 hr before the report time for aarti if you have booked online
Holy premises is well maintained.,"This of course is a very holy place for Indians and foreigners . Predominantly Hindu it also attracts believers of all faith. Considering the number of visitors, the premises are very well maintained by the  private trust ,"
Spirituality at its best,"The management of sai baba trust is just superb....no harrasment,no cheating,nothing....One rule for all...one will really feel the positive vibes and divinity of sai...great spiritual expirience"
Divinity resides,"Visited the Shirdi Sai Baba Samadhi temple after a very long time.Devotees have the option of taking in paid tickets with shorter queues or the free tickets which have more people and hence takes longer for one to proceed inside. The complex is hugeAnd one can also get books,cards and calendars with Shri Sai Baba photos. While it is crowded, the divinity of the place is unmistakable."
Saibaba Mandir,We visited with young children and had booked the online pass which helped us skip the queue and get in directly. The arrangement is really good and you get a good Darshan. The temple and the atmosphere is really spiritual.
Marvelous,"It is pleasure to share that the system of the place was very nice and organize. Would like to tell you one thing that don't follow the personal present out side the temple whom asking you to guide you for the entry pass and all that. They will cheat you in the name of poojas and other will charge more than you expect. All the things like mobile , bags and shoos counter are available inside the temple premisses. Other than this the whole experience of the temple visit was excellent. Must visit such Divine place."
Divine ,The Samadhi draws millions of devotees from all over the world.  Darshan is both free and paid.  In the former the wait time is long.  In the latter it's more organised.  We attended the Shej aarti at 10.30 pm.  A divine experience.  No cameras or mobile phones are allowed inside the Temple premises.  Security dies a good job of ensuring there is no stampede on days when the Temple is packed.
Blessed to be here,"Peaceful, serene and touched by presence of god aura around is full of peace cant write more as words wont be able to justify the blessings"
Corrupt staffs,This is the temple of Sai baba.Its highly charged place.But I was disappointed with the behaviour of the staffs (security)deployed in the temple They are very rude and corrupt.They give access to shorter routes if someone pay them even 50 rupees.I was shocked at their behaviour.Someone paid rs 50 near the Samadhi and they let him be near the Samadhi for a longer time while the lady security kept on pushing me and others.Besides the touts of the shops selling flowers prasadam are a big menace.The Sai trust does not take any action against them.They literally force the visitors to buy the flowers and prasadam.Wish the government did something to deal with the corruption here.Its disappointing to see so much of mal practices in a temple of repute.
Love,"Came to Sai temple in 2000, looking for hope love and laughter. 19 years later,  wonderful experiences but sadness, hope to overcome, it.  Wonderful time in dwarakamai."
sai Baba Samadhi Mandir Is most organised Pilgrimage temple I have visited.,"very well maintained, organised most professionally, No hanky panky and security and guards are very helpful. everthing is accounted even free entries ae with Coupons and Soon Biometrics linked with aadhar will be used. food at the Free Or with Nominal Donation if free line is big is again well maintained and cleanliness is very good, Food quality is One of the best, sitting arrangements Also very good."
Awesome experience,"4 hrs drive from Pune. Had booked my darshan pre hand to avoid the line. Although it was a Saturday, it was not very crowded. Was able to get the darshan in 15 mins"
3 NIGHTS with BABA,"Choose a time where it is not a peak season where you don't have long queues . If you are a foreigner, purchase the special pass . Remember no phones or cameras allowed in . Try to go for the kakad arathi , its heavenly ."
Must visit place ,We went during kakada arati. It was comfortable as we had VIP passes. Aarati timing was 4.30am. We had a Nice and pleasant darshana.
Be careful,Very good place to go but very crowded. There are so many people there to cheat you. It will be better if you avoid them. When there is so much people pushing you sometimes it is hard to feel vibrations...
Connect to Divinity,"Had been in mind to visit sai baba samadhi mandir for long and it actually turned true recently. It can be planned as a day trip from Mumbai like we did. You feel that peace and connect to divinity there. There are multiple places for darshan which can be covered in this overall place. The infra there is good to handle devotees. However some improvements possilbe still. The hall finally where whole crowd converges, this is where it become a commotion"
Our visit to SRi Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir,"I felt deeply blessed by the darshan of Sai Baba. The security arrangement and  controlling the devotees was really good.Self and wife had very good darshan inspite of crowd.The Priests, security and police people were all too good to understand the devotees mind."
Divine and sacred,"I know a lot of travelers visit daily to visit this place, but the atmosphere here of Sai Baba is worth noticing. Amidst of much crowd, you won't feel disturbed as you enter Samadhi inside the premises. You can offer prasad or flowers to the idol, but beware of frauds while keeping your belongings."
Peaceful,The energy and vibes of this temple is highly positive. You will feel very pleasant and calm. The temple is very organised. We had visited the 12 noon aarti session. Spent a good half an hour inside the temple during aarti. The templ offerings are yummy :)
"Divine, once a lifetime experience","We went to Shirdi from Chennai, this being our 4th trip thoroughly enjoyed the same with my family..The samadhi mandir was too good which offered utmost peace and felt thoroughly blessed.Advice would be to book online darshan in advance, thankfully one of our friends had informed the same, darshan got over in roughly 40 mins.."
Visit on Working Days to get Darshan Comfortably,"Having Sai Darshan is always like a power booster - it calms mind . I will recommend to visit Shirdi in such a way that you visit samadhi Mandir in non-rush hours and on weekdays - so that you can get the Darshan comfortably - there are VIP passes available as well please check at gate no. 3 - it saves time, however on any case count for atleast one hour"
The home of our beloved Sai Baba,"Devotees from all over the world come here to seek Baba's divine blessings.We've come here several times over the past 17 years and we have noticed several positive changes to the facilities provided by the Sansthan.On our recent trip, we were fortunate to have VIP darshan, which was a huge blessing!"
Best organized temple,"The temple is very well organized. The washroom facilities are best I have seen at any temple in India. For Senior Citizens, there is a special pass on showing Aadhar card at Gate 3. I availed of the pass for my father. It quickened the process and we had a great darshan of Baba."
Divine !,Shirdi ke sai baba.Must book ticket online both for VIP Darshan and Aarti. For Darshan - one week in advance For Aarti - 3-4 weeks in advance
Long queue for a few seconds visit,We stood in queue for 3 hours and we were cleared off by security personnel near the Shrine within a few seconds of reaching near and that's very hurting.
Soul soak !,Sai Baba's Divine Darshan are your direct gateway to experience divine bliss on earth.Online booking in advance makes the visit hassle free. Om Sai Ram
Om Sai Ram,It was my 2nd visit to Shirdi and things have changed a lot. The devotion and blessings seems attached to heart once you set foot in the Mandir. You have to take passes to enter the Mandir. Long queues anytime which reflects the faith people have in Baba. There are VIP passes also where the queue is not that long. You need to have at least 2-4 hours in hand to complete the darshan. On Sai Ram!!!!
Nice and well Managed,Some of the key things to note:1. Try to book darshan online and you will be able to get the darshan in 15-20 minutes. 2. Senior citizens should carry aadhar and they get VIP passes for free from gate no 2.3. Overall the temple is well managed.
Top place to visit in Shirdi,Very Nice place..a great temple..Very well managed. There are many entrance gate. One need to get bio metric pass for getting in...Normal queue time is around 2.5 hours
Darshan ,Sai baba darshan great feeling atma sudhi  manokamna purti.you have to prepare yourself because of big que.
Nice place,Very nice temple but is becoming very crowded we went on Saturday was extremely crowded the authorities should do something to control the hawakers and rickshaw drivers
Biometric card makes life easy.,"Temple authorities have created special counter for senior citizens and Handicap persons and its very convenient. Biometric card is issued but one has to carry Govt issued ID like aadhar card, Pan card etc and Handicap proof to get this facility.Biometric Registration is required or each and every person of the family / group and individual Free Darshan Access Card with barcode will be issued on an individual basis for checking at the entrance. But main problem is that one has to walk about 1 km or so to get into mandir from Gate No.3. For handicap person or senior citizen this creates problem as one has to step down many stairs also. One can get into mandir at request on vip gate. mandir trust bus drops one on main gate and from there after depositing mobile, luggage and shoes one has to walk almost 2 km to reach gate no. 3 which is big hectic. Mandir trust should do something in this regard. As seeing aarti, darshan at two different timings become difficult for handicap person or senior citizen."
Excellent place and nicely maintained,"Good place to visit. It's a temple and a popular one, so plan your visit accordingly. Visit early morning and book darshan online to avoid queue. If you are having a darshan booking then you have to be there at your allotted time and things will be smooth. Do carry printout of the booking confirmation, as paper print of the booking confirmation is needed."
Baba is great,We came here to take Darshan for new year of Shri Sai Baba.Really baba is great. Very positive energy after completed darshan
Trip to Sirdi,"Excellant ,well behaved staff, Amenities , location, Resturant all fantastic. Exceellant welcome & Departure with gift & Puja samagri. Like to stay again in this hotel if BABA calls us again. Very good Hospitalty indeed."
Good darshan ,Visited this temple so many times and each time I notice that the arrangements get better and better. Online booking for darshan was available and it took less than 30 minutes to finish the darshan. There is seating inside the q complex so devotees are having a comfortable darshan.
Happy new year ,"Jabardast ....management, marvelous arrangment of welcomeing new year and there is entry of saibaba is really great. ...Happy new year to st. Lauren hotel  management and all staff members. .."
First visit after Marriage,"Always feel blessed to visit Baba. It was our first visit after marrige togeather as a couple. Each time we visit there are changes , some pleasent and much organized and some looks more comercial. I wish the prasad counters were not too far and could be located just inside the temple or atlest near the exit gates. It was hard to look for the counters and again alot of walk which was confussing as wellAs time consuming. We dont mind spending time inside the mandir where after long wait were are pushed aside not able to wven take proper darshan. Rather than walking outside looking for free entry pass or vip pass and then walking another whole way to look for ladoo prasad counter. We love sai and would keep visiting however as much as we thank you for making security firm to protect any unforseen issues , we would highly appreciate if you can arrange eveyrhthing closer and we dont have to go north south east and west and finaly when we get toMeet baba we are pushed aside. Om Sai Ram🙏🏻"
Spiritual place for a peace of mind,Visit this place for spiritual peace. Its a place with its own aura. This place gives you warmth and increases calm in mind and soul
Temple darshan logistics,The best possible arrangements are in place for every one young and old. Om sai. The senio citizen counters have been very helpful for quick and hassle free darshan of sai vaba
Pilgrimage ,This is our first visit to Shirdi. This temple is managed very well by the trust and the volunteers team. Very much clean and peaceful place. Heavy rush is managed well. No priest is behind you for bakshish like any other tourist pilgrimage temple in India. The little museum is well maintained and informative.
"Nice Darshan, but overcrowded on Sunday's","Visited Shirdi temple with mom and dad on 29th-30th Dec 2018, we arrived at Gate no 5, since my mom has knee problem and she cannot walk much, we took the wheelchair from Gate no 5 PRO center. We need to handover a ID card mostly Adhaar to keep as a security deposit for wheelchair. Also my dad is a senior citizen, since we were 4 of us, mom dad me and my wife, we took 2 VIP passes of 200 each and for my Mom and me as a supporting wheelchair got a free pass near by gate no 3. This process of pass issuance took us around 20 mins of time. After that we went through Gate no 3 and for Darshan it took us 10 mins, Overall we were done in 30 mins. Sharing this information in case you are a senior citizen then one person can come along you and you can get your pass issued at Gate no 2 for senior citizen, but do carry your adhaar cards. Nice arrangements for Senior citizens and disabled persons, but beware the security personals around the gates have not much information so you have to better ask 3-4 persons before carrying out the process of Pass issuance. Hope this review helps."
🙏🙏👍,The online booking system is the best thing to have happened for the visitors. Quick and totally hassle free. Kudos to the management!
So well disciplined,"Shirdi now boast a nice well designed complex with proper boards, people to guide and help and lines. This beats the crowding we saw before."
Must Visit,Must place to visit for all Mumbaikars. Always crowded. They have all proper arrangements for entrance.
A nice and holy temple,A nice and holy temple. I visit mondir in 1st week. Its really  nice and holly temple with very nice prasadalaya and amenites. Strongly recommonding to visit temple atleast one time .
Darshan,"Place were baba use to reside & meet all people, give you immense peace of mind the moment you enter. With his Blessing any thing is possible. So please come & get blessed"
Top of the world spiritual place,"I found my self lucky to have a glimpse if the place were the lord sai actually stayed. I am feeling blessed by visiting this mandir.  One suggestion- you can book for vip darahan online from sai mandir website. But at the time of visit the mandir, please keep the hard copy…"
Samadhi mandir,Very nicely kept and very easy to approach for senior citizens.Jai Sai Ram.Actually we would prefer to go for general darshans rather than take tickets for Aarti.The waiting period is too much &there is no specific queue for senior citizens.If out of the many aarti for Sai if…
Rajni,Gate pass only causes extra hurdle in visiting Mandir. Entry is current. It is useful only when there is heavy rush
Family,Very devine and religious atmosphere . Samadhi mandir was full of sai naam slogans by sai bakhts. Out of the world feeling
Sai Ram,It was a wonderful experience during my recent sai mandhir to shirdi. Morning I went inside baba samadhi mandir and had a wonderful darshan. baba will bless everyopne
abode of peace,"this place is very sacred and you feels very very positive vibrations as soon as you reach thesamadhi mandir .  be calm and just pray baba , you will find tremendous peace and tranquility."
Peace,"Inner peace and solace is found here. Sai samadhi mandir, dwarakamai are the places for finding our inner peace"
Divine dining,After evening aarti I went to Sai Kitchen for dinner cum prasad. It was an excellent dining. Good food in the shape of pradad.
Must visit Unique attention to this place for Sai Baba,"learn about devotion of one person who devoted his life for common people, trust humanity and God's own child. When one start reading then somewhere you can add value for unity.By the way, you will be upset with mass, don't understand why everybody is busy even inside the temple, pushing, pick pocket and pull you back to go in is common"
Mystic experience ,Every year I visit Sai Baba's Mandir.Each year I feel so much rejuvenate and blessed .Without Baba's blessing it won't be possible.
Heaven,Heaven on Earth..the aura of the place is something that cannot be described in words..one can only experience it by being here...!
Sai Baba Temple,"We went on Diwali week.  It was super crowded. However you have one line for VIP darshan which make darshan easy in some 30 minutes,  however they will charge you 200 per person."
Very prosperous place,Very nice atmosphere.  Sai Baba samadhi  is attraction to visit this place.. Very famous sants in Maharashtra as well as in India. Sai Baba have unbelievable supernatural power. They live in poverty and spreat there goodness message to his prayer. I m so lucky to visit that place where Sai Baba was lived in past.
Om Sai Ram,must visit place if u r in Shirdi. Very well managed place even if its very crowded.  If you are on transit than there is a facility of pass for vip darshan at nominal donation... Mukh Darshan facility can be done in few minutes. Om sai ram
Shirdi Wale Sai Baba Ki Jai,This is the Samadhi Temple of Sai Baba. It is a beautiful temple with great management and all facilities available for devotees. There is a big crowd on Thursdays and holidays. Registration for Darshan is compulsory with help of any government approved ID Card like Aadhar or…
Amazing management,"Temple has all time rush and we were surprised by the management that how they manage everyday food,system and all other facilities to the all prayer.  We had some food there as prsad was very good the temple is the primary thing to visit shirdi. "
Must visit place,"Nice temple. difficult to visit using free pass due to heavy rush, paid pass is highly recommended. Rush is much lesser if visited in evening. "
Enthralling divine  Arathi experience ,I have been to Shirdi Baba temple 15 years back. But this time it was totally different. The temple committee have done lot of construction and they place looks so nice. It is very organized and follow strict procedures. The night Arthi we attended was very thrilling for me. For…
enjoy the crowd,"meant for followers of sai baba, as you enter the temple road, there are multiple paid parkings on the opposite side of the temple, so once you enter shirdi, near the temple you have to cross the temple , then take a u turn and go to the opposite side of the temple where there are multiple parking in the byelanes who charge around50 rs and they are also full most of the time. Now when you park, drop your mobiles, chappals, watches in the car as you cannot carry them in the temple. They have a facility to drop these things near the temple, but there is a huge line there. The routine queue takes anywhere from  one to three hours, so they have donation passes which takes you thru a shorter line, but a line for sure(not a direct entry) still have to walk a small line(around 100 metres ). The queue for the donation pass is near the  gate one and you need to carry an identity proof , one persons id proof required even if you are a group of four people. Nothing much to do once you are done with the temple visit."
Its a different world,"The magic powers of Baba and his kindness to his devotees are well known and documented. Every time I visit this holy temple of Baba, I feel energized and blessed. The sea of devotees chanting his name is a delight to all. There is something in the air of Shirdi and there is more than something in the miracles of Sai Baba. This is a must visit temple for all. Do not forget to visit Dwarakamai temple and have food in the Shri Sai Prasadalaya after darshan. It is free and very tasty.And finally, visit Shirdi as a Bhakt- not as a Tourist- this is my appeal."
Divine Darshan,It was our privilege to get darshan of Sai Baba in the auspicious month of Kartik.  A bit rush but maximum time you have to be in line for not more than 1 hours as the system is very users friendly.
Great place,"Very spiritual, need to book in advance and clean. Did not eat food there. went for Night Aarthi, with booking one month in advance...."
Best Place,Best ever place in my life is Shirdi and this mandir is too good and all pilgrims should visit the mandir.
Shirdi Saibaba,Nice Holly place well managed Totally Computerised entry free pass also for All Devotees Nice que arrangement With Cool water jug. During que also Well organized temple  Very clean.. Nice Staff
Sai Mehar,Visited Sai baba mandir in October 2018. Direct flight from Delhi to Shirdi made the journey more comfortable for my parents. Senior Citizen Darshan passes are available easily but you have to show identity and age proof. Same day paid Darshan passes also available at arrival…
Divine visit to Shirdi Temple,"We planned overnight trip to Shirdi and drove from Pune. Roads were good except for Ahmednagar bye pass, which should be avoided.  Temple, as usual was crowded with devotees. We sat outside temple in the late evening and saw the Aarti. It always is a divine feeling, when one is…"
A religious visit to shirdi,I can not review a holy place but I must say the place was very well organised. We visited the place on weekend so it was very crowded. There was a long but well organised queue. You can plan your visit on weekday to avoid a long queue. There is separate line for senior citizens…
Best Pilgrim Place in India,Shirdi is the best of all the spiritual places in India.. Even during the week of Navaratri and the week of Sai Baba's 100th anniversary the crowd management was Amazziinggg.. The place is also very clean and well maintained..Kudos to the management committee.
A short visit,Reached on saturday and back on sunday morning. The vip darshan passes cost 200/- INR per adult. Children go free. Passes are available near gate 1 and vip pass entry also from near the pass counter. Aarti pass is close to INR 600/- and recommended to book online
Bliss,My Life; My Feet; My Way; Bliss Only got a few moments to spend with him but they were awesome. God bless us all.
Well maintained,"I had been visiting the temple from the last 15 years. Good place, maintained neat and clean. There is special darshan for kids (below one year) along with parents and senior citizens above 60. For aged above 70, one person is allowed to go along. "
Darshan Sai Baba ,"Very neat and clean temple , always crowded but you will not feel any dull movement, avoid locals who come across for quick fix Darshan , go with either free pass from gate no 1 or paid pass from other gates depending on people you have with you , very pleasant temple , clean…"
Shirdi Sai Baba,You will feel definitely peace after looking at Sai baba in temple. After waiting in queue for few hours Darshan is awesome.
Big Temple,"I went to Sri Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir. The temple is beautifully made up of white marble, railed by eye-catching ornaments amidst two huge pillars. It is great place to go."
In the company of the Almighty......,Now we have to deposit the mobile and belongings before we seek entry. Convenient lockers are  near Gate No 1 which on the main road itself. We get tokens and are hands-free for darshan. No big crowds at all. Have darshan to heart's content. Feel very beautiful. Go to Lendi Baug…
This Holly place is awesome with wonderful experience,My Mom use to be saibaba devotee when i was child and i started believing in his principles and ideology when i am pursing my engineering and then totally believing and got good experiences after following his principles. First i will get blessings from him before starting any…
Divine Bliss,"I was fortunate to visit the Mandir 4 times in 2 days. Yes, I did buy an online ticket to secure my entry. The security is tight but everyone is friendly. Very systematic as far as queues are concerned. Entering the Mandir gives you total divine bliss. Ladies and gents are…"
Sai Darshan,"Jai Sainath!!, It is always a pleasant feeling when we go to any Tirth Asthal. This time we all family members went to Shirdi and have a very fast darshan of Sai baba and tae blessings. We stayed at Sai Bhakat Niwas which 1 KM far from the main Temple. There was no Rush at all,…"
Beautiful place,The best part is to take an online VIP pass and the darshan hardly takes less than half hour. A must go place atleast once a year.
Darshan - Sai Shirdi,Well managed by management and feeling blessed. This is my first visit. But Please note: beware from locals greedy agent who worked only on commissions(from rs 200 to 500max.) base from room to Prasad. Better go inside Sai market directly for Prasad and rooms. Free Vip passes Available for seniors citizens and disabled persons with 1 attendant and 3-4 year child. Om Sai Ram.
Baba is the God to pray to,"One of the most popular shrines in India. Sai Baba presence is felt by the believer. A sleepy town with limited facility is now a booming,well managed town. Every time i visit it I find that the clenliness factor is better. well connected to Bombay, Hyderabad and Delhi by flights and good roads to Nasik, Pune make it very easy to reach. Sai Baba does not need any body to speak for Him. He is the Almighty. Even non believers will change their mind when they are in His presence."
Great place.. Om Sainath..,Excellent place. You can spend peaceful time over there. You can see the things which was used by Sai Baba
VIP Culture,This was my 6 visit to temple. Earlier there was not token required for free darshan. Now they have started issuing pass for free darshan also. We planned to be part of 4 am Arati and we reached there at 3:15 am but they did not open gate for free darshan till VIP pass Holder got inside. This is not good atleast in temple money rule should not work. Any way I don't believe money power in temple. Jai Sai Baba.....
Divine place,"On our visit, we felt blessed by Shri Sai baba. Good darshan. Go for special pass, because the line moves fast. Mukh darshan is also way to see Sai again bypassing the crowd. Looking forward to visit the place again."
Om Sai Shree Shiradi Darshan,What a excellent arrangement. It’s really worth to see all arrangements in Shirdi temple. Other shrines of India must follow same for convenience of pilgrims. Om Sai.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Blessed by SAI,On our visit we saw the items used by SAI. They call it Samadhi but we felt He is only sleeping there and continues to bless us.
Bliss,The Samsthan takes good care of the devotees. Recently they have added the spot Special Darshan tickets priced at Rs 200/-. This is good as tehy are doing away with touts who were selling direct entry @ Rs 500/-. Also online facility is not always possible due to short notice…
Baba samadhi,This is the place where Sai Baba is believed to be buried. The place is located inside the main temple complex only.
Well worth the visit,"This was an amazing experience, and definitely worth a visit. There are a couple of reasons I did not give it 5 stars. Firstly they were very disorganised, it was very confusing exactly how to go about entering etc. Because of this there were plenty of touts trying to rip you off. Secondly, no fault of the temples.....I love Indians, and feel that they are very friendly, loving, caring, helpful and would give you the shirt off their backs, but they really must learn to Not to push and jostle, and be patient and wait their turn. This somehow seems to elude them I I find very irritating and it takes some of the joy of visiting some exceptional sights in India."
Must visit ,We visited Shirdi many times by god's grace. This time darshan was quick as we have booked for Shej aarati online. Even people were quick at donation counter and it was open till 10pm. It was blissful experience to see Shej aarati  First time in last 10years I witnessed one  temple security asking for bribe to send us first in the queue though we have denied and followed the queue.
Divine presence and blessings of Sai Baba during the aarti and at Dwarkamai Masjid,"Sai Baba is Lord Bramha Lord Vishnu and Lord Mahesh is one form.He was an incarnation of God and was Satguru.Satguru is lord Bramha ,lord Vishnu and lord Shiva in one form.He was incarnated as Daya Roop of God.His blessings are with everyone.The one who does good deeds have more blessings and the one with bad deeds have less blessings.In Dwarkamai Masjid Sai Baba Blesses devotees in the form of divine mother.Udi which comes from dhuni shows the final state of ash of all beings.Dhuni gives divine blessings.Sai Baba was all God in one form.Jai Sai Nath Jai Sai Ram Jai Sai Maa"
Ok Sai Ram,Got a golden opportunity in my life. Worshipped with my wife who is a devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba.🙏🙏🙏 Om Sai Ram 🙏🙏🙏
Divine place,"Very happy to be a part of kaakda Aarti. This place has a lot of positive energy which one can feel inside the temple. Temple is maintained very well. Prasad bhojan was simple but tasty. But cleanliness of utensils needs to be improved. Like most pilgrimage places in India, here too, shop keepers and street vendors try to loot you. Beware of them. Online darshan booking is easy. Do use this facility. Remember to Cary the booking confirmation slip and your ID proof. Go an hour before the time given in the slip through the gate mentioned. Shani gate is gate no. 1 don't get confused."
Om Sai Ram.,Dvine & Peaceful place. Every one should visit at least once in their life time. Worth going there. Temple is managed very well. neat and clean with all services Queue management can be better.  VIP services should be less encouraged.
ABSOLUTE DIVINE BLESSINGS, There is nothing like standing in front of the statue of the Divine Saint Sai Baba...seeking his intervention and blessings...The Artis are a must besides a Darshan.
A divine experience,If you can ensure being inside the Mandir when the Aarti is on ... it is truly a soul cleansing experience !!! 
Blessed Darshan,I had very good blessed Darshan of Baba. One can book online tickets for Aarathi and Darshan. Special Darshan facilities available for Senior citizens.  
what to say !!!,"this a place  of hope,  strength , trust, faith , for many people around the world . Except the crowd everything is great . The people in charge are trying to manage everything smoothly . the power of the place simply overpowers u "
Peaceful Trip,"Place is properly organised and all facilities have been made accordingly. Even in ques, they provide proper water, tea and place to sit for relax."
Queue formation for an entry to samadhi mandir,"There is no queue for senior citizens above 70 years of age, who generally, will not Combe stairs and get down the stairs along with those who are able bodied but purchased special darsan tickets. This caused us insurmountable difficulty to enter samadhi mandir and have the…"
Shirdi a Devine shrine! ,"A place where Sai baba lived most of his life. A Devine place every one has to visit. You can visit Samad hi mandir, Dwarakamayee, Chavadi, Hanuman mandir, Khandoba mandir. "
Very peace,"Excellent temple, excellent place, Peaceful place. Every one should visit at least once in their life time. Worth going there."
Divine place,"Must visit atleast once .Shirdi draws people from all walks of life, who believe that their requests will be granted by the saint."
Every year Darshan jai sai ram,"We travel every year , this year it took only 30 minutes to see the grand darshan , Jai sai Ram . the rood from mumbai to right turn to Shridi need more attention at few areas with proper sign boards. "
Amazing experience! But beware about Private Parking spaces,"Shirdi is truely spritual place. You feel content after Sai Baba's darshan.   As per my experience best plan to for Pune/Mumbai people (who usually come here on weekends), to avoid rush and long que would be reach to shirdi by Friday afternoon/evening. Take Sai baba's darshan by…"
An amazing experience,We booked the online darshan and it hardly took us 10 mins to get the darshan of baba Ji. Super fast moving queue. Luckily we got very less crowd.  Weather was awesome.  
Great Pilgrimage,You find peace of mind at Sri Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir. Excellent arrangement by the management. Senior citizens and sick persons find priority there.
visit to Sai Baba Mandir during kakad Arti,"this was our second kakad arti darshan. Actually we arrived late to the city and so the time to take rest was very less, have we were almost the last one to get into the VIP que. so had to stay back and sit inside the main hall, but worth waiting there and watching sai baba…"
Perfect,A good visit but this time appeared to be a  bit commercial. This can be in line with the high footfall. Overall a place to visit and get blessed. Although i dont but here would recommend to use VIP pass.
Do online booking to avoid crowd,"Visited this temple recently. We made online booking (which is free) and could have darshan in 30-40 minutes.  The ashramm provides accommodation, but it was not upto our liking. I would advise visitors to seek other types of accommodation."
A Holy place,This place does not need any review. If you are a devotee of Sai then you cannot miss it. Please plan your visit between Monday to Wednesday to have peaceful darshan of Baba
Great Place,Great temple but rush of visitors. Temple management committee weighs devotees by amount paid by them. Free darshan devotees wait in the queue for 2-3 hours and get pushed by security after a second of darshan. VIP ticket costs Rs 200 or Aarti costs Rs 400. I dont think Sai…
nice place,Nice place .you can finish free darshan in 2 hrs.systematic wife line..temple management should also concentrate on shop keepers surrounding the temple.who are looting devotes.
well organised,must visit - well organised and beautiful place to visit - must go once in a while - you feel energized
Great Darshan,Had a great Darshan of Baba. It is a good place and must visit place. I booked darshan ticket from online and it is well managed.
What a disconnect !,"The Sai Baba Mandir Samadhi is an amazing place with divine vibes. HOWEVER, there is a big disconnect between the way the affairs of the place are managed and everything Shri Sai Baba stood for. Sai Baba was known for his insistence on the equality of all before GOD. SABKA MALIK EK. Implying God is one for everybody. Everybody is equal in the eyes of God. However, this very thing is flouted openly at the Mandir. Devotees are categorised by the amount of Dakshina/ entry fee they pay. There is a normal darshan which may take a devotee hours for a possible fleeting darshan (view of Saibaba) if he does not buy a ticket. A Rs 200/= ticket gets one a special access. A Rs 400/= ticket gets the donor a special place for being present during the noon arati (mid-day prayer). Better still, a bigger donation amount gets a donor almost unlimited access to a special place in front of every other devotee from a vantage point.Sai Baba was against idol worship and difficult rituals. The priests have forgotten his very words and begun to worship him.The devotees are hounded and pushed around the temple by loud security guards shouting out their instructions.What should be a peaceful place is drowned by the cacophony of the howling out by guards and priests who wish the devotees to keep moving reducing the samadhi mandir to a fish market."
Devotinal place,Good place it is one of the famous temple in India forever and lot of place we have to see in this near
Divine place,Shirdi is associated with all the history of how god has come in common man and served society...Its nicely managed placed with all the necessary basic requirements..The feeling inside the temple is divine..There is queue system where it may take hours to get the darshan... but its worth...Stay away from all the other commercial things and keep your self in touch with god
Peace of mind,"Your visit to Baba will last for hardly few minutes, but its worth it. The atmosphere is divine. The complex is full of energy. Good to see people from across geography, class and religion surrender themselves at babas feet and satisfaction could bee seen on their face. Its…"
Spiritual Place,The place is in shirdi in the sai baba temple. There is too crowd. You have to walk several distance to be at this place
Baba has blessed.,This is the place where you go in addition to Dwarakamai. Have been going for the last 25 years. Temple provides for free darshan which would have taken 3 to 4 hours. But we went by buying Rs 200 tickets. This takes about 1 hour. Later we went by the Senior Citizen Token which…
Kakad Arti,"We booked online for kakad aarti. We went early in the morning around 2:45a.m thinking that we might get better position to view the kakard aarti, unfortunately at 4a.m when we reached inside there was already huge crowed inside those who weren't in the queue.Having spent so…"
Devonatal visit,Visit was good no so much of crowd nice to take blessing everywhere I see there is crowd at samadhi temple they done Good for devotte had to take biomettric pass at pass counter
No Comparision,"Huge rush, yet once you see Sai Baba there is no better feeling. Although its too commercialized still its one of the most divine experiences you can have."
Heavenly Feel ,"When you are in the Sri Sai Baba Samadhi, the feeling is unbelievable and you feel blessed. Thursday and Sunday are the very busy days. There is a separate line for senior citizens and on paying Rs 200 you can have a special pass where you jump the queue. It is located at Gate…"
Astonishing Amalgamating,"Digest that this Jeeva Samathi of Baba ji empties your pocket smoothly.Guru Poornima Is Great here.Food is served economically ,Must to be visited"
Blessed,We came to get blessings of baba ji. Huge huge rush even on monday morning. Buy a vip pass for Rs200 each. Worth spending that money. Security is quite good. Thy try to keep things organized.
Jai Sairam,Sairam. Blessed are the ones who get an opportunity to visit this holy place and be blessed by Baba. Sabka Malik Ek
om sairam,Truly divine place with full of energy and devotion. Om sairam.  No wonder devotees travel from across the world 
Samadhi mandir,"Shree sai baba samadhi mandir is the temple with sai samadhi! Camera,mobile all that electronic stuff are not allowed inside temple"
Sai Baba,"Famous temple which attracts pilgrims in thousands every day, you require to be in a Q, one can opt for v i p ticket on payment I believe RS 200 ,or if you are above 60 years of age , on showing Aadhar card , you get a pass to follow separate line for the senior citizens ,  One…"
"Huge temple, but really a profitable business","So this is a huge and famous Sai baba Mandir and hordes of people visit this place for darshan! To manage the crowd, the Mandir trust has kept various types of lines/ passes, where one is the regular and free and obviously the longest. For the others, the mandir trust charges…"
Darshan at Sai Temple,I am  very happyy to tell that the administration of Sai temple is vey nice.We did Darshan very happily.Realy i t is very pious place.dwarkamai and Chavadi and temple is holly and historical places.
The most popular temple in Shirdi,You can either go for free darshan or VIP entry which will cost you Rs200/- per person which will save your time to a great extent.This main attraction in Shirdi offers several food joints (pure veg) outside at affordable prices including dominos and some other chains as well. One can try local dishes in restaurants and soviniers outside the temple at reasonable prices. Temple has very positive vibes with fragrances of flowers all over.
Tips for people visiting with kids,"We went to temple on the siddhi day and there was a huge crowd at the temple. For those who want to have quick darshan, there are vip tickets sold at the p.r.o office for 100 or rs 150. Please check with the temple volunteers. On siddhi day no vip tickets. There are people who promise for the same for double the cost outside the temple which is not legal. There is no separate queue for 1 yr old baby with parents. There are feeding rooms in every floor. If you want to avoid rush and you are having a baby then go on weekdays. Not on long weekends or weekends. Go very early. As early as 5.00 or 6.00 am so that your darshan is over by 11.30 am. The queue stagnates between 11.30 to 1.00 pm due to aarti. Going to temple in the evening is also a good choice.Jai Sairam."
The only purpose of visit to Shirdi - Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir,"Avoid Thursdays as there is a mad rush on Thursdays for darshan. VIP passes are available at the PRO office and if you have a good reference / able to give a donation above 25000 Rs. you will be escorted into via the Nandi Gate which beats all queues and the waiting time becomes very less. However it is worth the effort only if you wish to attend the Aarti. Other pass holders will be escorted in through the Shani Gate which is better than the routine long queues, but still leaves a lot to be desired."
OM SAI RAM,the sai baba temple in shirdi is shri sai baba sansthan trust sai baba accepted the state of samadhi
Darshan ,Great visit as the temple is so neat and clean and very well managed and organised had a great darshan of sai baba
Blessings of Shirdi Sai Baba Maharaja,It did take more than 24 Years for Shirdi Sai Baba to bless me with his Divine Blessings and Aarthi. I had the Best Darshan and Aarthi and I felt the Divine Power of Shirdi Sai Baba. Fantastic and Divine Experience!
Can avail online booking for darshan and Aarti ,"You can book darshan and Aarti tickets online for quick darshan.  You can enter through gate number 4 where free chappal stand is there and can enter in to the special darshan queue   There is separate queue for senior citizens and couple with infants   Thanks, "
Jai sai ram must visit,Attended kakad arti in 4.30 morning. Great experience. Although we can't reach inside samadhi Mandir but during Q all can watch arti on LED TV screen. It's even a better experience bcz even inside Mandir so much crowd is there at arti time that one cannot see properly arti…
Added few very helpful services.,"They have started with special free pass for family having children up to 1 year. With this pass child, mom, dad and siblings can get entry through a very small queue. You may have problem getting pass, if you have 3 adults trying to get it with just 1 child.   Additionally they…"
Om Sai,Shirdi is a place where you get mental peace. It's must visit place for mumbaikars. It took 2.5 hours in bus from Nasik to Shirdi and the fare is nominal of 175/person. There are few things to be kept in mind while visiting this place. 1. Always buy your VIP passes in advance so…
Sai!,Visited Sai Darshan today from Mumbai. It took around 4 hours from Mumbai to Temple. Roads are good and greenery all around. Darshan took almost 45 minutes despite paid pass. Not a very good arrangement to control the crowd. People were pushing each other to get enter first. Sai…
Shirdi ke Sai Baba,"The temple is not what is used to be several years ago. Too much of commercialization of this temple complex has ruined the charm of it. However, visit with a clear mind and you will find peace here. Yes there are long queues and yes there is rush all around and yet you can sit…"
Real development lines move fast.,Om Sai Ram. It is a really good place. New VIP line gets you to do darshan in 15 mins. Do not get swayed by local people who will say the gate is towards that side and bla bla .... Ask the officials- police or guards or ones at counter
Must Visit Place,"This is the must visit place of Shirdi.  A Marble Statue of Shri Sai Baba is so live, that you feel like Sai Baba is really sitting in front of you."
Seemed like visiting a 'Mela',Too commercial..its all about money money and money...there shouldn't be any discrimination system..
Most comfortable place on earth...,Best place when you having trouble ask to Sai baba he will give you  definitely .I always visit every after 2 years very clean and staffs are well trained and serves good meal...jai Sai ram..
Temple visit ,Relaxing and meditation for people  Long day with many timing for prayers  Early morning good as not so hot
Divine Experience ,Felt refreshed and blessed after Sai baba's darshan. Its amazing to feel the divine energy in & around the temple
Divine,The less is say the more it is! It has changed my perspective regarding what I had about God or any infinite power per say. Sahi kaha jaata hai ki baba ka jab bulawa aaega tabhi you'll be able to visit
Divine but Beware of touts,Much awaited visit to Dai baba was concluded in month of May 2018. It was a 5 hr drive from Mumbai where we stayed. The moment we reached couple of folks approached us to buy parsad and offerings for baba. They suggested to enter from gate 4 which was near to their shops and per…
Money wins always..,Due to VIP crowd we have to stand in a que more than 6 hour.  I think if i paid 200 for myself for an vip line i will get darshan within a hour. Money is everything at last
Devotional Place,Sai Baba mandir is very famous devotional place in India and the baba is very powerful and all our wishes come true by praying to Sai Baba
A place of religious History,"I visited Sai Baba’s Samadhi with my family. Then place was well built, the samadhi darbaar was well built. The only thing which it lack was the management. We went through general entry and we had to stand at one place constantly for about 1.5-2 hrs. Dont know why the mangement closed the door, although the VIP are was free and open. Some people were crossing the bars to skip the lines and the management was reluctant to the situation. The place also attracts pilgrims from India and foreign area. But the stories and description on the walls was given in local Language (Marathi). This is very irritating to see marathi everywhere when people from all over world are visiting. At least a common language should be written beside so that everyone can read the history."
Shirdi Sai Baba-Pass system,We have taken up pass directly from Gate#1 and it took hardly one hour to complete us darshan of Sai Baba in temple.  I visited on Saturday. Once you will see Sai baba in temple all your tiredness go away. This is must visit place several time in life.
One must visit Sai Samadhi Mandir,I have been visiting Shirdi  every year to have Darshan of Baba since 18 years. Always feel like visiting shirdi  for  general darshan & kakad aarti. Now a days one can book VIP entry ticket by paying a certain amount on arrival too- which is a very good arrangement by the trust.
