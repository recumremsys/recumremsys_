Nice Visit and views.,30-40 minute by driving from town.Very nice views of the whole mountain range.Small park otherwise nothing exceptional.But worth it if you are there.
Batasia Loop,It is maintained very nicely. Cleanliness 100 percent. View of mountains is also nice if the sky is clear. Toy train ride should be more frequent. You get the feeling of British period when you come here....I loved sitting for a while in the bench at the station shade.It is one of the famous Tourist attractions and 5 kms from Darjeeling and is below Ghoom. Here the DHR chugs along the entire garden. The garden and surroundings are very well maintained. There are large telescopes installed which could be hired at a cost. You can actually view the city from the top. There is no better place to get a 360 degree view of Darjeeling's landscape including the hill town and the snow covered peaks of the Eastern Himalayas with the majestic Kanchenjunga on one side.An ideal place for clicking photographs in different local traditional attires. The entrance ticket is 20/- per head. A visit is a must while you are in the beautiful hills of Darjeeling.
 the gradient of the slope,Batasia Loop was commissioned in 1919 because it was an engineering requirement for the toy train to be able to handle a steep gradient. Just after Ghoom (which is the highest railway station) there is a sharp fall as the toy train moves towards Darjeeling. There was no way the toy train could negotiate such a drastic fall of about 140ft unless there was a way to somehow reduce the gradient of the slope.
Interesting ,It is maintained very nicely. Cleanliness 100 percent. View of mountains is also nice if the sky is clear. Toy train ride should be more frequent. You get the feeling of British period when you come here....I loved sitting for a while in the bench at the station shade.
Stunning little garden with a view,"We went to the Batasia loop in the joy ride toy train. The train stops here for 10 minutes for us to enjoy the beautiful view from this little garden and appreciate the awesome train route loop. Loved the place, so clean"
View point ,Very foggy day so didn't see much . Will be beautiful when all the seedlings are  flowering . Relaxing area. Historic interest
Decent Attraction,War memorial and Garden surrounded by the heritage rail track. One of the local site attraction in Darjeeling.
War Memorial - Visit a Must,Batasia Loop is a memorial to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army. Batasia means airy space.  It is one of the famous Tourist attractions and 5 kms from Darjeeling and is below Ghoom. Here the DHR chugs along the entire garden. The garden and surroundings are very well maintained. There are large telescopes installed which could be hired at a cost. You can actually view the city from the top.

Batasia Loop garden with beautiful view,EnglishBatasia Loop is a beautiful garden located in Darjeeling.  We saw doing the ride on the Joy ride toy train. The Joy ride toy train stops here for 10 minutes.  One part from the garden is fantastic panoramic and the other part of the garden you can see the city.  Here it is written in large letters I love Darjeeling.There are stairs to sit and there is also binoculars to see the city.One can sit even half an hour here to see beautiful views.Don't forget to take pictures here.  An extraordinary experience.Italiano Batasia Loop è un bello giardino si trova in Darjeeling. Abbiamo visto faccendo il giro sul trenino di gioia  ( Joy ride toy train ) . Il trenino di gioia ( Joy ride toy train ) si ferma qui per 10 minuti . Una parte dal giardino è panoramica fantastica e altra parte del giardino si vede  la città.  Qui si trova scritto in grande Io amo Darjeeling. Ci sono i banchi per sedere e c'è anche i binocolo per vedere la città. Uno puo sedere anche mezz'ora qui per vedere belle panorame.Non dimenticare di fare foto qui.  Un esperienza straordinaria.
Morning visit ,"I walked to the Batavia loop from Darjeeling mainly to see the Gurkhas Memorial. It was a pleasant walk with great views. The Memorial was good and 2 trains arrived whilst I was there, there market stalls and the opportunity to dress in traditional dress."
beautiful backdrop,"really nice setting and manicured gardens, it also has the I love Darjeeling sign and the commemoration for the fallen. Really nice to see the train whistle past in loops with the backdrop of Kanchenjunga."
Great view,"Great view of Kangchenjunga, beautiful spot, must visit as part of darjeeling tour. It's part of heritage railway."
War Memorial,Originally built to commemorate the brave Indian national army soldiers. The place is also gives majestic view of Mt. Kanchenjunga. The iconic Darjeeling Himalayan Railways(Joy Ride) passes through Batasia Loop.
A memorable experience of steam engine times,"The short ride between Darjeeling and Ghum on one of the small steam-locomotive drawn trains is a great, nostalgic experience of the days of travel by steam engines."
Lovely experience,Well maintained and nice place to see marvel of railways plus memorial. Overall nice experience to visit.
Mostly for the view,"They make a big deal about that stop on the touristy points, it's fun to see the little train looping once, and the merchants around, but mostly a nice view of the mountains..."
Good memorial,The toy train takes you around this memorial. This is a good spot for taking pics as it has nice forest cover in the background and beautiful flowers inside the park. You can find some maggi and momos stall around the place.
A nice experience in Darjeeling and photographer's place if weather permits you.,"As a pro-photographer, taking shot of heritage train in this loop was a must for me from years. From here you can take photos of Darjeeling, flowers in garden, and Mt. Kanchenjunga all together in one frame only if good weather permits you. The Joy-Ride trip from Darjeeling to Ghoom back and forth in two hours passes twice through this site. If you take the Joy-Train Ride, it stops for 15 minutes in the Batasia Loop, a war memorial park with the statue of a Gorkha soldier in Indian Army.Entrance to the territory of 20 rupees per person for walk-in visitors. You can hire local clothes and take pictures. Steam locomotives producing black smoke is the rare scene you find anywhere in the world nowadays. Although fees was charged to go inside but local sellers and vendors have filled the entire area and made it disgusting. It would be nice if only park is maintained and no sellers are allowed."
A lovely place to remember,"We in our Darjeeling trip , we visited this place. Good small garden. Well maintained lawns , bit crowded place. View of kanjanjanga is great."
Beautiful train loop with a memorial ,Batasia loop is a prominent feature of Darjeeling . Here the railway track takes a bend and there is a Martyrs memorial here . Views are wonderful
This should not even class as an attraction,"As per the title, this should not rank as an attraction. There is very little to see and it is not representative of what is seen on the marketing."
Train stop,Supposedly a garden and would have been magnificent a whileback according to the photos at the Museum at Ghum station.Statues in the centre are for troops killed in recent operations against Pakistan
Nice early morning garden to visit,It has the Gorkha martyrs names as also the railway station so worth a good walk.and to have the fresh milky tea outside.
Best point after tiger hill,I visited this point in 8 april 2019...but weather is unpredictable..so we face to rain on that time..all tourist have to visit this point after visit to tiger hill in early morning..you have to wake up in early mornig to visit tiger hill  and batasia loop...after tiger hill i thinks best point in darjeeling is batasia loop..you can also see this point in afternoon too...
nice gardens,"I enjoyed my trip on the toy train here and this stop has a lovely view and pretty gardens, worth a visit."
Batasia loop,It has a small memorial built in memory of brave Gorkha soldiers who made supreme sacrifice in various wars . view of mount Kanchenjunga is  also mesmerizing.
Good Experience,"Great views of Kanchenjunga, Toy Train stops here. Nice garden to sit. Can spend an hour moving around."
Good for a tour ,"A Very clean stretch, this is a quick stop during the toy train ride. At a higher altitude, this place is known for its lush greenery and scenic beauty alongside its significance as a memorial ground."
Visit to batasia Loop,"If you are taking a toy train ride from Darjeeling, you will pass by this magnificent loop. Otherwise, take a cab from Darjeeling town and visit the Batasia Loop. It's located on Hill Cart Road (i.e. National Highway 55) and takes 20 minutes by taxi from Darjeeling town.  There is no better place to get a 360 degree view of Darjeeling's landscape including the hill town and the snow covered peaks of the Eastern Himalayas with the majestic Kanchenjunga on one side. And all this from the middle of a lovely flowering garden around which the toy train track is laid."
Scenic,"Just a small loop for toy train to turn back to darjeeling.Although fees was charged to go inside but local sweater sellers and vendors have filled the entire area and made it disgusting..it would be nice if only park is maintained and no sellers are allowed, even the"" I ❤ Darjeeling"" board was occupied. They should preserve their beautiful spots."
Joy Ride,One of the most amazing joy ride in lovely greenery atmosphere at world's highest railway track to Ghoom via Batasia Loop was most memorable for life time.
mESMERIZING tRIP,"a TRIP ON THIS TRAIN WHICH IS RUNNING ALONGSIDE THE ROAD WITH SPEEDY CARS THAN THE TRAIN A VISUAL DELIGHT OF nATURE IN A NATURAL WAY OF SPPEED.Itis true that sometimes you are just elusive and can only enjoy the vastness of greenery  ,the trees and clouds then this ride is one which should be taken,though expensive nut definitely shall not be forgotten for a long long time.The loop is a 360 degrees rond and is quiet a visual."
View point,"A beautiful garden, war memorial and view of the majestic mountain kanchenjungha... Do not miss the view..."
Beautiful,Though was not able to see the whole place properly due to fog and rain but could make out the beauty of this place.Maximum 1 hr spending time recommended.If lucky you may get a train ride every 30 minutes .
good photo ops,its a memorial with toy train track . you can get good view here as well as good pictures. should visit in darjeeling
loop,its is in the memory of soldiers who martyr in the battle and when toy-train comes at there looking nice.
Spiral track - Darjeeling Himalayan Railway,"Toy train ascends at this place, to lower the gradient of the ascent this loop was created. Here track spirals around itself over a tunnel. Place is well beautified with gardening and a war memorial of Gorkha soldiers in Indian Army is also built."
Offers Great views and UNESCO World Heritage Toy Train,"The toy train offers unparalleled views during a joyride. Batasia Loop has beautifully manicured garden, and a great view of Mt. Kanchenjunga. The toy train using coal as fuel is regarded a must heritage ride."
Toy Train,"Book a toy train online a month before form irctc website. Choose station codes DJ(Darjeeling) to DJRZ(darjeeling) coz its a loop train. Darjeeling to Darjeeling back form Batasia loop. Train passes form different small villages, roads and take U turn from Batasia loop which is a must sight seeing place"
A small place to see the mountains.,Nothing much to say about this area. It's a small area to see the mountains around. Downhill from Darjelling. Good hotels in Darjelling gives you a better view.
BEAUTIFUL VIEW,i visited this place by riding joy ride toy train.. climate was wonderful.. i was roaming in beautiful clouds.. nice park.. and memorial... beautiful spot
Batasia Loop & Eco Garden,Excellent place for clicking for some nice pictures. The traditional dresses are available on rent to take pictures.Outside park lot of local vendors selling local dishes which are fresh & delicious.
Darjeeling Himalayan railway,The train was not operating when we visited. This a great place to view the Darjeeling Himalayan railway and take some great photos. Currently some construction work and repairs going on.
A must visit place,Visited this place two times; once as part of 3 point tour in the morning. It was crowded and people selling items. There were multiple options of pakodas and tea in the morning for light snacks. Second time was when we were having the ride in the toy train. Trains stops for almost 10 mins here. At this time it was very less crowded and you can appreciate the beauty of the gardens and the majestic Panoramic views of the valley. Views are fantastic as you can view Darjeeling town with Kanchenjunga in the backdrop.
Little wonder.,We visited in june n it was covered during toy train ride. It was misty morning n that made the place more attractive.
Ok,"When we were traveling from Gangtok to Darjeeling,we passed through this Loop.It is just ok.It was crowded."
a place to remember and visit,"This is a spiral railway created at around 1919 to lower the gradient of ascent of the ascent of toy train cal;led darjeling himalayn railway ( a private railway ) that runs from siliuguri ( nearest airport is baghdogra) to Darjeling after crossing highest platform station called GHOOM- India's highest station. The station building includes a first-floor museum. BATASIA LOOP is 5 km from Darjeeling, below Ghum. There is also a memorial to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who sacrificed their lives after the Indian Independence in 1947... Between Siliguri and Darjeeling, Tonga services ran on a cart road todays Hill Cart Road. The railway track runs almost parallel to this.  The loop has a panoramic view of Darjeeling, with Kangchenjunga and other snow-capped mountains in the background. Simply awesome"
A loop and a war memorial with beautiful mountain views ,"Everytime I visited the place, I was able to see Kanchanjanghaa. The war memorial looks excellent in front of the great sleeping Buddha"
Beautiful loop,The place is made and maintained very nicely and beautifully....they also have a war memorial plus steam engine running in loop... Just for checking the history this is a place to visit
Over rated park,"Its nothing but an over rated park. I wouldnt call it a garden , as its very poorly maintained. The park has a sign board ' I  ❤️ darjeeling ' . And there is no support behond the signboard. So if someone falls , he/she will go at at least a 100 feet down. When the steam train comes, the whole park gets filled with fumes from the engine. Just not worth visiting at all."
"Nice, scenic",By toy train we reached. Visited the park. Nicely decorated. Toy train experience was awesome through this park
Good for quick visit,A war memorial with small circular garden tracks surrounding it. As common in Darjeeling you can see a lot of small shops around garden. We spent 20 mins max. The views from here are stunning if you get a clear weather although similar views can be seen from other places.
Awesome Place,I want to come here again and again... magnificent view... Every time I visited I amazed by the beauty of nature...
A war memorial.,"A war memorial turned to a picnic spot with bunch of toy trains polluting this beautiful serene place, located just at outskirts of Darjeeling,must not be missed by you."
A Nice Romantic Destination,"Well, remember the evergreen song Mere Sapno Ki Rani Kab Ayegi Tu? Yes, it was shot at Batasia Loop. There’s a charge of Rs. 20/- per head. If you are taking Joy Ride, the train halts at Batasia Loop anyway and this charge is included within the ticket price. It’s actually a beautiful garden with narrow gauge train line for DHR (Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) in form of a loop with a War Memorial constructed in the memories of Gorkha soldiers. Well, what’s so special then? Imagine this (if you can), a Steam Engined DHR hauling through the loop overlooking the range of almighty Kanchenjunga! You are bound to go back into your childhood memories – Mere Sapno Ki Rani Kab Ayegi Tu to be specific!"
Historical,Very historical place and beautiful. Very beautiful landscaping. Wonderful experience when the toy train passes.
Rarest engineering marvel,"Seeing is believing, unique engineering marvel of British era where narrow gauge train moves 360 degree at such a high gradient."
Best View of the Mountain Range,The joy ride between Darj and Ghoom passe through Batasia loop or a figure 8 loop.The toy train chuggs to a halt on top of this loop and there is an observatory and Gurkha Soldiers memorial with a lovely garden.The view is simply amazing.
batasia loop,an engineering marvel by which the Himalayan Railway descends steeply or climbs up in short distance. Has entry ticket and a sort of garden.
Fantastic,Only place in darjeeling which is neat and well maintained. Photo location. Though artificial nice to watch it on a foggy day. The train journey through Batasia loop is also amazing. Overall a nice experience. Strongly recommend this place to all who visit Darjeeling.
Nice place. Quick round and leave,Its a memorial for our soldiers. Good to visit pay our respects to our brave soldiers. Take a few photos and proceed to next point.Jai Hind!.
Train journey,Toy train journey from darleeling to ghoom and back it was a thrilling ride across sceneries and main roads. Great one.Raja
A good point to Visit,Its s basically War memorial built in middle of city along with Garden. This place is visited at time of returning after visit of Sun rise at Kanchanjunga hills. Point doesnot need huge time and offers some points for snacks and shopping also.
Fabulous views,We visited the awesome Batasia loop in May 2019. The world heritage status of the legendary spot is well deserved. One cannot find words to describe the beautiful landscapes here. The historical train and the track is incredibly exciting. Mind is easily drifted into the calmness and peace. A must must see spot in Darjeeling.
Nice spot in Darjeeling,This is point where Darjeeling train takes a loop. The view from this point is very nice. There is a war memorial statue. Overall a good place to take photos and spend sometime watching the Himalayan mountains.
"10/10, would recommend.",Entry ticket costs 20 INR per person if one goes by road. Iconic loop helps the train gain altitude in a tiny space. The loop also consists of a war memorial. A paid toilet is accessible. Kindly do not litter.
Nice spot ,Good spot to spend the time and take photos especially when the toy train makes a halt nice view good
Batasia Loop was exceptional,Must see place while in Djg and I saw this enroute in the Djg-Ghum-Djg heritage DHR toy train...one gets to see some great views with crisp mountain air...I was lucky to have got clear views
Excellent memorial,Visited Batasia with family and its a great tribute to the martyrs of our country. A must visit place when in Darjeeling.
Very good,Amazing scenic view in this small place.one can hang out and enjoy food from local shops.very beautiful picnic spot.
Great place with beautiful surroundings,A place where the toy train gsins height drastically. Its a sight to see ehen the train keeps circling to gain height.
A fine memorial,"This memorial was made in memory of the Gurkha soldiers. The famous Darjeeling toy train also makes a stop here. This popular tourist attraction commands beautiful views of the surrounding areas. The long narrow pillar in the centre and the statue of a soldier standing guard next to it, is quite moving."
war memorial,Nice place to retrospect and pay homage to our war heroes.well maintained. the toy train stops here. good garden.
Must visit place,"This is a heritage place and most popular steam engine train that runs between Darjeeling and Ghoom passes this place and halts for 2-3 minutes. We did not get booking for the train but enjoyed the view of train from this place. Be there between 11:30-12:00, get breathtaking view of tea garden and mountains. The train that starts at 11:00 from Darjeeeling comes here at this time, you can also take pictures with the majestic steam engine while it stops for a minute.ine can also have kanchanjunga view from here."
Quick stop off the train,"We stopped at Batasia Loop for 10 minutes while riding the Toy Train. Nice monument, beautiful gardens, but really not enough time to sit and relax and take pictures, as the train will leave with or without you on board."
World Heritage sight,It is the location which is declared as world heritage for world famous Dargeeling Himalayan Railways. At this place the toy train takes 360 degree turn and it is an engineering marvel built by British in the year 1880. It also view point and on a clear day one can view Mount Kanchenjunga from here
Batasia loop,I have visited this place in last week of April.You have a beautiful scenery from this place.Actually it's a garden with beautiful flowers you can take pictures here in local costume.There is one memorial of Gorkha regiment of army.Must visit place in Darjeeling.
Loop the Loop,"Even though the whole general area of Darjeeling has received numerous facelifts, the old time charm never ceases to amaze the traveler in us. 'Ghoom' literally translates to 'dizzy' in their lingo. That's because it's the highest point one can be transported to. The rest has to be hiked or ridden to. Bagdogra airport is the local one, but I'm not sure what the name is now. The toy train uses a ratchet system to take people up there and some actually dismount from it and walk alongside on slower stretches. Pretty cool esp with the alpine like views of the range and the landscapes. Lots of fog in Ghoom, so thick at times you have zero visibility even while walking. Evening and night walks can be hazardous if you don't use heavy duty flashlights (torches) in some areas.Gardens and floral displays are intoxicatingly gorgeous everywhere even the outdoor mall and entrance and along the meandering paths in the park (zoo). People are friendly and welcoming. Hailing from obscure mountain cultures like Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet its intriguing how similar they appear. Most consider themselves Indian around here. Shopping for local curios and fare is an experience not to be missed. Bargaining is a national tradition and you can come away with ridiculous deals if you develop a knack for it, as the locals do. Don't make the mistake of bidding them farewell because they always welcome you back with a general, see you again or until we meet again greeting in different languages and dialects. There are so many dialects it can be overwhelming for the visitor to the great nation that proudly calls itself home to all. India is a virtual diaspora of complexity. It's been said that once you visit there for a long enough time, you never come back the same person, lol! Always a better version of yourself usually destined to return and be a part of it. Cheers!"
Very nice place,A very well maintained place where you can see dargeeling through binoculars and dress up in tea garden attire and even. Pick up tea in some bushes planted there. Can do marketing and buy gift  items from nearby shops.
Nice place for enjoying and shopping,"This batasia loop is a tourist spot from where you can see Kanchanjangha clearly. Professional photographers are there to capture your pics on chargeable basis. Local shopping is also available there. If you take toy train joy ride,it gives 10 mins halt at batasia loop."
Not worth the time !!,"It is supposedly an engineering marvel which interests kids, but suited for adults or teenagers as it was boring. The war memorial is in the centre of the batasia loop and there is nothing much to see otherwise, while in train.But not to miss the samosa and pakodas served just outside batasia loop(they are very tasty)."
Entranced throughout the journey,"Great short trip along narrow guage railway. Travelled past many dwellings, crossed several roads and waved to countless bystanders taking photos of the little train. Stopped at the loop for a while to take pictures. Enjoyable experience."
Overrated,"The entry ticket is rs 20. It is on everyone 's local tour. The place is not maintained at all.  Only you get a view of the valley, which you can get from other view points as well.  Maybe on a good clear day you will get a good view of the snow capped maintain range. The toy train trip stops here for 10 minutes. People are naturally excited when the toy train does a loop here ( why it is so named). There is a war memorial here in the middle of the park."
Nice sight seeing place,"Definitely worth your visit in darjeeling. Very nice garden with train stoppage and matyrs statue. You can either take a you train to reach here or hire a taxi. It's near darjeeling and take about 20min to reach here. Beautiful scenes all around this place and very dramatic to see the train enter here, wait for few minutes and return back. Overall a nice experience for everyone when in darjeeling."
Joy Ride with DHR,I with my two of friends visited the Batasia Loop and DHR museum at Ghoom station. The items of display are very interesting.
heaven,"One of the most attractive tourist place in Darjeeling, Batasia loop just 5 kms away from Darjeeling town. The beautiful toy train takes a 360 degree loop here. Batasia loop popularly known as war memorial of gorkha soldiers, who sacrificed there life in various war after india's independence. Scenic beauty is at its best in this place. its a good place to spend a quality time but not foe very long time otherwise you will be bored."
O.k to visit,We went there at 7 am in the morning. It was very nice place. We wear local dress and took lot of snaps also we saw very nice views through binoculars also there was lot of greenery. So overall a very pleasant place to visit in Darjeeling as there are very few places to visit here.
A must visit to witness the steam engine run toy rail,You can get the best view of toy train from this location. A good location for best panoramic views of Darjeeling and surrounding hills. A best location for photography enthusiasts.
Very Well maintained,if you have planned taking a toy/joy train ride then there is no need to visit this place separately. very clean and well maintained. does not look like you are in Darjeeling compared to the litter and dirt outside we see. Trains stops there for approx. 10 min and you get good time to click photos in front of train and along the park.
Sooty but a great view at the loop,We took the steam toy train from Darjeeling station through the loop to Ghum. Fabulous views along the way but we kept the window open to take photos and got covered in soot. Might be best to take the diesel option! The stop at the loop has a 180 degree view back to Darjeeling.
A memorial park,"Batasia loop is a loop line for the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, joy ride. It has  a memorial tower  of Gorkha Martyrs. The place is very windy. Visit in the morning to have the best feeling and on a sunny day."
ASIM CHAKRABARTI ,"You can enjoy a beautiful view of the city,  local telescopes service will addon you a extra mile. But too much hawkers are creating a lot distractions to enjoy the place. You can enjoy the local snacks specially in the morning hours."
Batasia Loop,Batasia Loop is one of ths beautifully decorated place in Darjeeling. Here toy train line also moves according to the loop. A solider statue is also Kept in the middle of the loop. People visiting Darjeeling must visit this place.
Well maintained place.....,Well maintained war monument. Really nice view of kanchenjunga from here. Also the DHR circle two time in this place.
good experience,we went to see the batasia loop from Darjeeling by the famous himalayan railway it was an experience to remember
Okay,"We took a Joyride tour from Darjeeling to Ghoom ,that takes a 10 min halt at Batasia loop,a little park with view and war memorial Nice place ,there are binoculars installed to show you various points in Darjeeling"
Old world charm,"We went in the toy train around the batasia loop. There's some old world charm in this. Loved it. We had booked the tickets online before reaching Darjeeling. Almost a month ahead. You can.opt for the diesel trains or steam engine trains. Steam engine trains are costlier but they are the original ones. We finished the train rides, came walking to our hotel. There were lots of little shops on the streets where you can.buy woollens at a very cheap price. For personal use or for gifts."
Avoidable !,"The DHR joy ride took us to Batasia loop. A small garden with a view is all . Crowded & noisy .Unless one has any knowledge of brave Gurkhas & their contribution to the armed forces one doesn't understand the significance.Seen people shouting , running around ."
Nice view,"During our toy train joy ride, the train stops at the loop, although the duration is less, definitely would have liked to spend more time here. It has got a beautiful view of Mt. Kanchenjunga."
A place filled with tourists and of great historic importance,Batasia loop is a part of Darjeeling's sight seeing tour and it is not far from main Darjeeling city. Once can enjoy the atmosphere here and the nicely decorated garden inside. The beauty of Darjeeling city could be seen from here. The momos sold in nearby stalls are delicious.
Beautiful experience.,This loop is worth a visit only if u take the ride in the train. Just a suggestion -Avoid wearing white or light colour clothes the steam engines smoke might ruin them.
toy train experience,"a one time experience you would enjoy with your family and friends, slightly expensive , but the heritage would die if we do not use and sponsor this."
North East India Tour,Very well maintained park in memory of martynrs of Indian army which died in war with China in 1965 it's a worthy place
Tribute to Brave hearts - War Memorial,"This place is built for our soldiers who martyred during wars or any relief work for country.. Behind the war memorial you can see the mountains.. You can feel the emotions in the statues who is paying tribute, May our all soldiers live long and get all the happiness.  Salute to all the soldiers."
Not even close to being a good Park or Garden,"Technically, this is a loop for the trains to reduce their ascent. However, this has become some sort of a memorial park. When we were there, there was hardly any grass or a leaf on the plants. I would skip this any day."
Attractive stop on the train journey to Ghoom,Do get off and enjoy the 10 minutes at Batasia loop in the gradens around the war memorial which are well kept
Unbelievable place,We had been hearing of this place since quite a long time and thus we didn't miss the opportunity this time and truly speaking we all were mesmerized. Perhaps any one will be liking this place.
One time but a must visit place,Another local sightseeing destination of Darjeeling. Loop has a flavor of patriotism with a flag hoisted and a symbol in center.Overall place is lively and nice spots for photography. The toy train going around the place give a lot good view. Should go!!!
A must visit place in Darjeeling,Batasia loop is a must visit destination when one is visiting Darjeeling. It's a place from where one can have full panaromic view of Darjeeling town. A fantastic place to spend a sunny day.Darjeeling toy train also halts here for 15 minutes and our visit coinsided with this.From Darjeeling taxi stand one can hire taxi or can go in share as well.
Toy train stoppage,It's a nice garden with a war memorial inside it where the toy train gives you a stoppage for around 10-15 minutes. Nice place to click photos and get a bird's eye view of the town from the loop. The local cab will also take you there if you go for morning trip to tiger hill and covers ghum monastery for the 3 point sight seeing package cab trip. But we had already booked toy train tickets so we enjoyed it via train only
Beauty of Darjeeling,"The Himalayan Toy train taking the turns in the Batasia Loop, is a sight to behold. You can also click pictures in traditional clothes at Rs 50/-. Rent a telescope to watch the Kanchanjunga more clearly. A beautiful place in Darjeeling, not to be missed"
Beautiful!,One of the better spots to see in Darjeeling. Beautiful and well maintained. Beautiful view of the Kanchenjunga. Don’t bother using the binoculars. Tried it and didn’t think it was worth it. Looks beautiful to the naked eye from this spot. You can also dress up in the local attire for a reasonable price and take photographs.
Visit this by train,Batasia Loop is part of a railway track used by the Darjeeling toy train. The train stops at Batasia Loop for 10 minutes before returning to Darjeeling. It has a monument to those Gurkhas killed in action. During Winter the garden in the surrounding park area suffer from the cold. From Spring onward there would be more green vegetation to see.
Loop,Here is located a loop where the train goes around but it is also a war memorial and some gardens. Most come here as part of the sunrise tours to Tiger Hill. If you come by yourself try to avoid at that time and it will be much more serene.
A nice place to visit while in Darjeeling,Nice location to watch the Kanchenjunga mountain range and see the Himalayan train from close vicinity
A view of concrete Darjeeling.,"You will see only the concrete or habitat structures of Darjeeling. It's densed with buildings. However if you opt to avail the services of a binoculars view with a guide, it's mind boggling. Nature in its true sense."
A beautiful point,This is a beautiful place in Darjeeling and offers a spectacular view and the Best thing is the train stops here for sometime.
Historical..,Evergreen song from film Aradhana .. Mere Sapnon ki rani..shot here and many more..Enjoy the view and roam at leisure for a brief stop of the toy train.
Not so great,Had different expectations before visiting this place. Not sure why they take entrance fees for this place. There is no information provided about the significance of the place. One can just play around on the rail tracks. It also has a war memorial but again not much information about it is provided
Best in train,"The usual itinerary of Darjeeling sight seeing takes you to batasia loop at morning 7 , however the place is best if u take the dhr toy train to explore, the view is majestic with train backdrop. The batasia loop is a war memorial garden."
Batasia Loop,Beautiful concept of the heritage train doing a ramp walk for her admirers. Basic safety measures are required in the park.
Amazing Batasia loop,"On the way to Darjeeling from Siliguri by the famous Toy Train journey passes through the Batasia Loop and the War Memorial. This place is 5 kms. ahead of Darjeeling city and located in between Ghoom ( The highest point in the world where Locomotive Engines operate) and Darjeeling cities.Batasia Loop attracts people for spectacular view of Mt. Kanchenjunga & other snow capped Himalayan Peaks and watches the remarkable engineering marvel of Darjeeling Himalayan Railways where almost imperceptibly the railway line negotiates a circle and descends 1000 ft. in altitude. At the centre of Batasia Loop a War Memorial stands. This memorial was constructed by the  District Sainik Board. Darjeeling in commemoration of the brave Gorkha Soldiers, who sacrificed their life to protect the sovereignty of the Nation since independence. This memorial was sanctified on 22nd March, 1995.

Batasia loop,Nice view . Binacular view of Kanchenjunga was very nice .you can see the ToyTrain haulted for a while .nice esperience . We visit late morning after 9 am so we found the ToyTrain. Early morning it's not possible as no trains comes then
Toy train,Have a ride on Toy train running alon road and showing a few places of interest.Railway museum on other end of halt.
Sit there and see the view,"Good place to see , toy train passed through this place in a loop manner . You can spend an evening there watching great view of mountains and also can enjoy the toy train ride."
A must visit site,It is a must visit site if the weather is clear then the beuty of Mt kanchajonga will take away all tiredness of the road trip. You can also enjoy it in the morning after watching the tiger hill sunrise.
Batasia Loop,Very nice place.. there is loop style railway track... There u can enjoy view of nature.. or u can also buy some clothes.. if u are visiting in winter u can get snow falls too..
"Visit at the Batasia Loop, Darjeeling","The Batasia loop is a spiral railway line created to lower the gradient of ascent of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in the darjeeling District of west Bengal, India. In this point the railway track makes a 360 degree turn. Here the track spirals around to ascend the hill top. It was commissioned in 1919. from this point the world's 3rd highest pick Kanchenjunga of Himalaya range is visible clearly on a clear day. It is situated almost 5 km away from Darjeeling town."
Good visit,almost everything in these 2 states lean on the mountain Range Kanchanjunga to make an otherwise average trip excellent ... everywhere you go this is thrust on you like there is nothing else to showcase ...Even in this famous loop where you have now a garden and a gorka memorial ...the main highlight is the view from powerful binoculars on rent of the famous Kanchanjunga.. Salute to the majestic range …!!!
Engineering marvel-Batasia loop,Batasia loop is famous not only for for engineering marvel of British engineers but it also offers 360 degree view of Darjeeling landscape with hill town and snow covered peaks of East Himalayan range with majestic Kanchanjunga. The toy train has to manage a sudden slope of 140 ft after Ghoom station so this beautiful loop is created where the toy train crosses its own tacks which one would never realise having gone through such a steep slop. Apart from this there are planned fliwers on both sides and its an enjoyable journey
Batasia Loop at December,It was awesome experience. Weather was clear due to snowfall on previous day's. Kanchenjunga range is clearly visible from this point if weather is clear.
Beautiful Garden,"Very beautiful garden. Amazing view of sikkim, china & darjeeling mountains. Full of greenery. Very well sitting arrangements. Binoculars available @40 per head which gives you magnificient, though for a small span of time,view."
A PART OF TOY TRAIN RIDE,It is just for fun people take the toy train in Darjiling. Both steam engine and diesel driven train are available for the same route. The train stops for about 10 mins at Batasia loop. Nice view can be enjoyed from there if the sky is clear.
Must visit place between Ghoom and Darjeeling stations,"The Batasia Loop is a particular place near Batasia Cantonment area in which a spiral has been created to lower the gradient of ascent of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. At this point, the track spirals around over itself through a tunnel and over a hilltop and you will realize the same. The experience is great and must have one when in Ghoom or Darjeeling."
An overwhelming experience,"The memorial against the backdrop of the mountain ranges, is a view one does not come across often. Very well kept, the place does justice to its name. It is peaceful to just sit and watch the train pass by, admire the beauty of the landscape and also spare a moment of gratitude for the soldiers who bravely gave up their lives for the country."
Batasia Loop,"An engineering marvel with nature abounding. A tribute to the Gorkha Regiment soldiers, who died fighting for the country, evoke a sense of nationality."
On the way for Darjeeling,"You may stay here to avoid Darjeeling crowd and rushBeautiful place, avail toy train, or just sit in a bench and enjoy natural beauty"
Good only of u visit as part of toy train ride,"Don't go as an outsider tourist. I understand it's all business and being a tourist spot Darjeeling has all of these, everywhere. You spend 20 bucks for ticket and then you see the same mountains and same flowers that you can see anywhere in Darjeeling. There's a monument to celebrate Gorkha fighters. You can take photos of yourself in local costumes by paying 70 rs. The best way to visit here is by toy train where the entrance fee is covered with the ticket price"
"it was very good location on the hill to view the valley,if visibility ok may be Kanchanjuga range visible.","As i mentioned avoid public holidays and choose time between march april to visit.I went to visit Tenzing Norgey house but it was locked,window panes broken as no one lived there anymore."
War memorial - UNESCO Heritage site,"Batasia Loop has been recognized as UNESCO Heritage. It has been built as War memorial for the Gorkha soldiers.This is also an Engineering marvel as it enables the train to descend the gradient from Darjeeling to Ghoom. The train goes around the memorial in a loop & stops for a few mins.The memorial & the garden have been well maintained.Book the tickets once you land in Darjeeling itself and check the timings.Otherwise, you might miss the show.The entire toy train journey is an experience to cherish esp. Ghoom being the highest station in India."
Good place to visit,"Now, it's a loop coz the toy train comes around from Darjeeling and GHUM and stays for a while here. Beautifully maintained garden with the Gorkha War memorial in center. It's quite picturesque and worthy of some time spent here as u look out into the Darjeeling town with big binoculars. Free entry if u from FAUJ!"
What an Engineering.... Good View,You train risers up the gradient and you want even realise if you are in the train. Awesome.....If sky is clear....view of Himalaya is awesome....Visiting early in the morning is good
Homage to brave Gorkhas,"The place is nice and one of the must see places from Darjeeling The place is traffic free and very well maintainedPlace has very good views like Valley and Mountains , The memorial it self, The train station at such a high altitude around the memorial One must pay homage to Brave , Loyal Gorkhas for their contribution for the country"
Places of interest in Darjeeling,A beautiful garden setting and historical displays. Good to relax and watch the steam toy train meander through.
nice place,this is a nice place to view Kanchenjunga but the day have to be very clear. we were not in luck for that.
The technological wonder-A spiral loop,"As name suggests, it's a spiral loop sorrounding a hill by which the toy train increase it's track height around 20: feet by one loop!Commissioned way back in 1919, one of the must visit place on way to Ghum railway station.On its top,within the circular train track,there are beautiful garden and also have the monument of Gorkha souldiers who took part in pre and post Indian freedom movement.One can also reach here by road by taking entry ticket of Rs 20 only."
Dreadful,"This is a stop on the incredibly disappointing 'toy' train.  There is nothing of interest here and the view is often obscured by mist, pollution or both. Of course, the pollution is partially created by the train itself which belches smoke as it carts tourists around at ripoff prices. Avoid unless you're really desperate to find something to do in Darjeeling (which you might be!)"
Waste of time,I got taken to this as part of a tour after seeing the sun rise on Tiger Hill. It was not worth the time or the 20 rupee entry fee. There’s nothing to see apart from some track and some bushes. It’s also full of vendors selling cheap goods.
Crowded and over commercialised,"What it's supposed to be: A combination of a gorkha memorial, garden, and a binocular view point of the city and hills.What it's become - a too-convenient touch point for all tourists returning from Tiger Hill Sunrise. Too many vendors hawking their wares , too many ""binocular guides"" offering to show all the sights on a foggy morning.. an unplanned garden..and thronging with tourists trying to take selfies in a crowded place.. not a memorable experience for me."
War memorial is a highlight,"Your steam train will stop here if you are on the way to or from Darjeeling. You won’t miss your train because they blow the whistle to get everyone back on board.There are lovely views of the surrounding countryside and Darjeeling town, but a highlight is the beautiful war memorial. It is simple in design but very poignant. You can dress up in local clothes, like a tea picker, then take photos. There is time to do this while you stop.The loop itself will interest train lovers."
Nice landscaped train station ,This place is very far from centre of Darjeeling...close to ghoom monastery ..one can club ghoom and this visit together..lot of street vendors selling warm woollen on both ends of the train track that runs in round loop..
Good Place to see the Toy Train,You would get to see the best possible view in Darjeeling. Toy train does a fool loop of this park while on its ride.
Loopy,It was a great loop...suddenly  the sight of the majestic Kanchenjunga  range sprang up as us turned on the loop on the toy train from Ghoom to Darjeeling . Now it has become all touristy. Manicured gardens and all. Guess people can't leave well enough alone.
Very beautiful scenic beauty of nature,It's a very beautiful place to visit as the scenic beauty of nature is mind blowing!Everyone should visit the place will travelling to Darjeeling!Entry fees is Rs 20 only per person!
Beautiful ,This is one of the activities that you can do in the early morning starting with tiger hill. From here you get a 360 degree view of the city which is beautiful. There is ine martyrdom in the centrw of the loop where names of the martyrs of the war is written. Amazing place.
Nice ,Good place to visit. Its clean and enjoy toy train. You can enjoy dresses of hills and click some memorable pics.
Nice view of Kanchanjangha,Batasia Loop is a nice place to visit in Darjeeling. You can have a nice view of Kanchanjangha if weather is favourable.
Very foggy when we visited . ,Decent location to visit . Nothing major to do. We came here as a stop on the toy train ride.   If weather is good then view can be good .
A lush green toy train pathway,"Perhaps one of the most picturesque train routes in all of Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop is a lush green toy train pathway that is meant to minimise the elevation of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The unique design of this magnificent attraction allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory. Situated in Ghum which is about 5 kilometres from Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop was commissioned for construction in the year 1919. A memorial dedicated to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who laid down their lives during the war of Indian independence is situated close by as well. Batasia Loop rises from the midst of emerald carpets of mountain vegetation and overlooks the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha on one side as well. Endearing flowers line the way, which makes a trip through this attraction a must after you have witnessed the fascinating sunrise of Tiger Hill. The view of the train tearing past the white of the clouds and deeper into the green beauty of the terrain is a refreshing and enchanting expedition which should not be missed."
Nice place,Batasia Loop is a very nice place to visit in Darjeeling.View from the Himalayan Railway is very good.
ok place,OK place Most people come to this while coming back from tiger hill. there is nothing to see also too crowded in morning
Loop!!,The toy train comes for a loop here. Its a nice war memorial and you can get a binocular's view of small portion of Darjeeling.
An amazing engineering marvel in the history of Indian Railways,Here toy train takes a 360 degree turn which is quite an amazing experience since it is situated in mountain.
Average place,"Most people come to this while coming back from tiger hill. So, it was little over crowded. Local people sale pakora, mirchi bhaji etc outside the entrance. There is an entry fee of Rs 20 for adults. There is a war memorial inside. Nothing much to do inside."
Nice Place,Batasia Loop is around 5km from Darjeeling and can be covered under the sightseeing tourIf you are taking the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway tour/ride then it can be covered under it as the train goes to Ghum via this place with a hault of 10 minutes
Beautiful Scene...,a place which can be skip.. the war memorial and the beautiful garden with toy train tracks...amazing it is.. ticket is mandate.
Must visit place ,Must visit place in Darjeeling. The war memorial and walk around it is good. Do plan to visit in morning when there is clear sky and good weather. The toy train also makes a stop here.
Brilliant,"I went to Batasia Loop. Located around 5 km from Darjeeling, Batasia loop is a spiral railway track where the toy train takes a complete 360 degree turn. The toy train descends by 1,000 ft. as it completes the loop through a large circular area. It is great place to go."
A different Batasia Loop amidst mist,"We had been to this place many a times but not by the Toy Train. The charges for Steam drawn toy train or Diesel drawn toy trains ( Joy Rides) are very high . These trains have 1st class only and rates are as far as I remember Rs 1300/- for Steam drives and and a little less about  Rs 900/- for Diesel driven engines. Since this only 8-10 Km journey ( about 20 KM both ways) drills hole in pockets, I prefer to go to Batasia Loop by taxi . This well maintained place is excellent in a sunny day but in a cloudy day this is beautiful too. There are plenty of eateries in Batasia Loop area and one can pass good time here woth friends or family.Entry fee is Rs 20/- per head."
A war memorial,Best place to hang over with your partner or family with kids.Views are amazing take sufficient time to make photos.
Stunning views of mountains from Batasia Loop...,Batasia loop has a train track and a garden offering great views of the Kanchenjunga. The day we went there was bright sunshine and we got brilliant views of the mountain to take photos for a lifetime !! There will be option to try the local dresses for taking pics as well. It also is a army memorial and is a salute to the martyrdom of Indian Armed Forces. Do visit during your travels to Darjeeling !!
family trip,every one should come and visit this place ..the famous song from Aaradhna staring Rajesh khanna and sharmila Tagore..mere spano ki raani kab aayegi....was pictured from this place ..the Toy train
Excellent place just out of history,"There is a wonderful round train track and stoppage around the Gorkha Regiment statue, the memory is very historic."
Great work of Engineering,The famous Batasia loop is designed to overcome the up slope by providing loop on the railway track. Because of this the track crosses each other at a point. I enjoyed this ride first time in 1973 and enjoyed again with family
Dreamy Ride,"Imagine - a little railway stationCute toy train that runs on steamYou co-passengers not in a hurry to go anywhereTrain chugging slowly around the winding hillsYou can get down walk and still catch itPeople running shops or students walking to school or colleges waving at youWild weeds that cover the mossy rocks bloom with exquisite beautyWherever you turn, all you see is happy smiling peopleThat my friend is what you will expect from this rideThe train starts from one station goes around parts of the town, halts at a park and then returnsThis is a loop - Batasia loopPlus you get to dress up in colourful local attire."
Must Visit in Darjleeing,A very good view of mountains and the greenery. You can go by road as well as toy train. Toy train take halt of 10 mins  at this place.
Scenic views of Darjeeling from Batasia Loop!,"Batasia Loop is a lovely garden landscaping area at a height in central Darjeeling that offers breathtaking views of the mountains and Darjeeling city!Also, most importantly. The toy train stops here and offers great opportunities for taking pictures with the toy train with the mountains in the backdrop!!"
Mesmerizing,Enjoyed a lot amidst of drizzling.Good scenic view. Better to visit in toy train.surrounding views are picturesque.
Nothing great,Highly disappointed. So many people have their Stalls to sell any stuff. Not worth spending much time.
Must Visit if in Darjeeling,"Toy train is majestic and knowing the fact that it was started in 1882 makes it even more interesting. Hats off to the engineers and team who worked on it at that time. Unfortunately as Independent India we have done nothing to enhance its glory. Infact Darjeeling which which was known as queen of Himalayas is chocking with trash ,dirty roads,everywhere Diesel old  Taxis Plying in city just to add Pollution . No modernization  of roads. with such mesmerizing natural beauty the place has capability to attract tourists from around the world  . All it requires is basic facilities like good roads ,clean city and a bit of mordernization."
The magestic toy train,"Don't have much things to fo excep photo shooting within the greenery..  but when you will feel the vibe of entrance of the toy train with the whistle,and finally be able to see the steam in the fog along with the toy train..definitely it's worth."
Must visit atleast once,"Good place to visit,entry is very nominal rs 20 and a good place for super view.war memorial in memory of our great soldiers,great thing to watch is toy train going through the park."
Must Visit,"Scenic beauty, well decorated Garden, Looking at train taking a loop around the garden is very pleasant."
Beautiful place,It's nice to visit the Barbotey Rock Garden in Darjeeling. Awesome view and relaxing place. I would love to visit again.
Average,Batasia loop or Batasia war memorial is a memorial built for the Gurkhas. As we enter the park we can see the toy train track round the park. A midway stopover for the toy train. The weather was misty during our visit. You have an option to dress in local attire and take photographs.If you have lot of time then visit otherwise you can skip it.
go on steam engine,"had fun there, went in steam engine. nice place to take pictures among flowers and mountains. also try binoculars to view the hills"
Beautiful views from top,"We visited Batasia Loop twice - once while taking the ""toy train"" joyride on Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) and second time while driving around Darjeeling town. The first time was nice - the DHR train stopped at the loop for ~10 minutes and everybody got down to visit the well-kept and beautiful garden in the centre of the loop as well as the inspiring war memorial. But our second time was amazing - we saw the loop in its entirety from the top of adjacent hill and saw the heritage trains going around the whole loop - beautiful and spectacular."
Nice,It is a loop in the route of Darjeeling toy train. Well maintained garden. Nice experience during the train journey
Good,Please include you can do photography and their telescope there for you can see Kanchenjunga mountain better if you go with your train train stop there for 10 minutes
The famous loop,"Visited it as a part of joyride in the toytrain with a 10min stop at this place. There is a Gurkha war memorial at the centre with well maintsined garden. The trains chugging in and out of course is the chief attraction. However, according yo people who have visited before, the developmental activities have taken out part of the thrill."
A glorified Park!,"A glorified Park! only highlight is the himalayan railway route is inside this park, and we got to see the train pass by. That is a first having railway line inside a park. Otherwise, nothing spectacular about this park."
Enjoy the Views,"Batasia means ""airy space""(open area).This is landscaped  garden through which the toy train passes in a loop like pattern. Batasia loop  was created to counter the sharp descent for the toy train(140 feet).At the center of the attraction is the war memorial.It has a cenotaph and statue of soldier paying homage.This place is famous for beautiful views of Darjeeling landscape and snowy mountain peaks.Relax stroll through the well maintained garden with  colourful flowers, enjoying lovely  valley views."
Deja vu,"Hving seen millions of snaps already, it is a bit of a deja vu. Best done by the DHR. Stay within the complex as outside etc is not very well maintained. During monsoons, the view consisted only of clouds so the basic of the loop doesn't come across.The DHR tho is worth every penny."
Real Nepali Experince,GO there by morning around 10 am and you can take some wonderful pictures by wearing the Nepali costumes. Also around 10.30 the steam and the deisel toy trains will reach there one after the other and gives you a great sight of the engines moving.
Memorial place,"The place is full of memory. It has great view of Darjeeling, can be seen through train too. Love to visit it again"
A beautiful place for pics,"It is a memorial. We have visited on route when toy train stopped here. From this place, we can see beauty all around and take beautiful pics. Also there are many beautiful flowers."
See the Majestic Kanchenjunga for the first time :),Batasia loop comes after Ghum when you are travelling from Bagdogra to Darjeeling.It is located on a high mound where the heritage train loops around a garden and takes a halt for sometime.Tourists who are not on train can just get there by road.The catch is the view of snow clad Kanchenjunga ranges from here.It is a magnificent view and there are telescopes and local guides to help you watch each range in detail.This place is worth a visit !
Loop at Batasia,Batasia loop- sounds exotic and mysterious. Yes it is. The Gurkha soldier in solemn repose paying homage to his fallen comrades. The encircling garden evergreen withe soldiers statue in the centre is poignant and will remain in your heart far after you have left. Simply put it throws you into a loop. Dont miss the Batasia loop. Respect.
A 360 degree Railway loop  Turn,Batasia loop is near to Darjeeling. You can experience this spot when you travel from Darjeeling to Ghoom by Toy train. If you do not have railway booking then by road you can see this spot in local sightscreen package. It is wonder of engineering in 19th century. Railway train can take 360 turn and gain 140 feet height from Dajeeling to Ghoom and vice a versa. You can also do shopping there is you travel by road. You can also see Mt.Kanchanjanga from this location if weather is clear.
Best view at Batasia Loop,Amazing view of hills from this beautiful place which has 360 degree view . It's is an amazing place to see the joy train ride.we enjoyed this place during morning walk and saw the memorial of maryter. Must see place
Birthday celebration at darjeeling,"The attraction is worth a visit while you are in darjeeling. The open mountain view with a toy train is picture perfect. Also the typical toy train loops are UNESCO world heritage site. The place is covered with flowers and greens.. A must visit site with friends, family and your beloved one."
A Loop worth the count!!,The Batasia Loop is a magnificent one and has been made to lower the steepness of the climb of the Himalayan railway.It comes just after the Ghoom and is a picturesque location where the Toy train stops and you can take pictures with the train and the Kanchenjunga in the background!!
Serene view,We took toy train and batasia loop was one of the spots which toy train covered. It is very pleasing to human eyes. A treat to watch. Our family enjoyed a lot
Worth watching in darjeeling,Nice tourist spot in darjeeling to enjoy after a early morning trek to watch sunrise. U wl see a nice back drop of mt. Kanchenjunga behind batasia loop
Toy train stopping point,Batasia loop is a loop on himalayan darjeeling railway line which is a very good scnic point for photography with toy train stoipping for 10 minutes here. It has a soldier statue and India flag
Must visit in Darjeeling,A scenic spot to click your pics with the Toy Trains in Darjeeling. Well maintained and can also have a joy ride in the trains. But need to buy your tickets from Darjeeling station was what I was told.
The loop you can do without,Now this is one loop that you can avoid. The steam engine chugging all around the loop although presents a glorious picture of magnificent past yet it causes trapping of all the PM10 and PM 25 particles with in the small hillock. The beautiful scenic view sometimes leaves one or more coal particles in your eyes. The govt.and Greenpeace people can chip in by showcasing the steam engine and taking the tourist in a ride on diesel engine only around the ghoom. People will heave a sigh of actual relief.
Leisure,Beautiful Place. Lovely Surroundings. We took joy ride of Darjeeling Himalayan Railways. Worth being there.
Scenic place..,This is the place to get a 360 degree view of Darjeeling's landscape including the hill town and the snow covered peaks of the Eastern Himalayas with the majestic Kanchenjunga on one side. And all this from the middle of a lovely flowering garden around which the toy train track is laid. At the center of the Batasia Loop is the War Memorial. This was memory of the Gorkha soldiers of the Darjeeling Hills who sacrificed their lives in various wars after India's independence. At an elevated platform there is a  statue of a soldier paying homage...You can both enjoy the views standing on the garden and also the ride along the loop if you take the train.. This is the best maintained place in Darjeeling...
Hyped!,Its ok. Nothing reall special about it. The toy Train ride is over-hyped. It travels via the city- so no scenic route. Ghoom is quite crowded and dirty...
Northeast tour,A nice place to visit and take pictures as its location is at a height. U can enjoy the toy 🚆 which stops here.its also a kind of war memorial with neatly maintained garden. U can get a good view from herr
A small park cum trade centre 🤩😝,"Batasia loop or Batasia war memorial is a memorial built for the Gurkhas. As we enter the park we can see the toy train track round the park. It has the best view for the Himalayan range I.e., viewing the third highest mountain the KANCHENJUNGA!! We visited it as a part of our Three point tour."
A nice place on the roadside in Darjeeling,"The loop is actually a toy train loop on the hills by the road side in Darjeeling. There are gardens and flowers on the , city onthe hills can viewed from here. People can ride toy train for short while."
Its a garden and memorial,I personally think that this place can be given a easy skip. The place is a small garden with a memorial built for soldiers who have been martyered. There is no specific uniqueness about the place
A pleasing garden out of nowhere,"A midway stopover for the toy train. A nicely manicured garden of the top of a small hillock, before the toy train must travel in loops to climb for Ghoom. Nice spot for photography."
Scenic ride in an heritage toy train,"We did this train ride from Darjeeling to Ghoom. A very interesting ride where the train track and road crisscross many times and also through the narrow crowded roads of the city. The intermediate stop of 10 minutes at the Batasia Loop, give one an opportunity to take keep sake pictures with the antique steam locomotive."
Nice loop,"We enjoyed the journey by toy train, we went with family so enjoyed a lot. Amazing view, best place for taking pics.  It's a must visit place."
Scenic railway loop,The place has abundance of greenery and multiple viewpoints which makes you feel good among the mountains.. The winding trains through the lopp gives you a nice experience
Relating with childhood memories ,I had gone to Darjeeling with my parents around 40 yrs back and had loved the toy train ride thoroughly .But I couldn’t relate to my childhood memories as the train routes through crowded roads of the city .In my recent visit to Darjeeling alongwith my children I took them for a toy train ride . We took the older steam Engine train but the spirit of enjoying the ride was dampened by the amount of smoke it was discharging and causing a lot of  air pollution.I think only the Diesel engine should be allowed to run the train and the steam engine should be discontinued immediately
Worst.,Worst place i have ever seen. No views.  Just traffic and pollution. Too much shop and very costly. I suggest all not to go at the place
A toy train a must for the kds,"My grandson had a ball going on this ""chuff chuff"" train. He did not want to get off and had to be persuaded to do so. The train chuffs past peoples front doors, across the main road and has a ""I think I can I thought I could"" rhythm to it. A must for anyone young at heat not just my grandson!!!"
Beautiful loop,The loop is situated in the midst of the market and gives beautiful view of mountain sorroundings. one can see the toy train too taking round of the loop.
Ticket cost is very high,If you are going for the city tour no need to have toy ride. Toy ride tickets are very expensive about 800 /person. Scenic view is all most same as you watch in your city tour. The distance covered is also less.
Enjoy the valley views.. simple place,"Nice place to get down when the toy train halts. Memorial park is good one to visit. Do read the roll of honour slab in the park. As such there is nothing to do here, other than walk around till the toy train starts it journey back."
Nice place to see the scenic view of Darjeeling,The places offers a nice view of the hills and also offers options to get your pictures clicked in the traditional attire. Overall nice place to travel with kids.
Darjeeling and Sikkkim tour,Situated on the way from Ghoom railway station to Darjeeling..The toy train turns around the park . Quite fascinating to be a part of the journey.It hardly takes 10 minutes  to reach it from Ghoom railway station. Garden is nicely maintained.There is a war memorial created in the memory of Gorkha soldiers who have lost their lives while fighting for the motherland.The entry fee is very nominal.
Beautiful place to visit,We got off our toy train for 10minute halt. Since it was foggy couldn't get to enjoy much the view . But have a few clicks to share.
Very adventurous,"You could enjoy the side view of the rail track. If cloud does not cover the side ways, you can enjoy the deep valley beside the track."
Enjoyed walking on the loop,"Though we didn't spend much time but we liked this place. This place has a different attraction, I mean BATASIA LOOP plus TOY TRAIN. The weather was misty during our visit. Overall this place is nice."
BEAUTIFUL BATASIA,Here  you can still see the narrow gauge steam engine pulled toy train and the landscape is worth watching for hours. The statue of our Indian Soldier is an added splendour to the park.
Great Place to visit,"Batasia Loop is the gradient where the train from Darjeeling almost drops 100 ft in one single loop. It is an engineering marvel of the railways.There is a very nice Kargil war memorial there along with a nice garden. if you take the toy train joy ride, the train stops at Batasia Loop for 10 minutes."
Engineering Marvel,"A Batasia loop is an engineering marvel which has a difference of almost 100 ft by just a loop.. a must visit especially for all Engineers. A Gorkha Memorial is constructed right at the centre and is a very good tourist spot. Though it doesn’t have any entrance fees, but optional donation of ₹20 is there at the entrance. One could enjoy when the toy train actually enters this arena.. you can have many local streets shop inside Batasia Loop. A treat to watch.."
Can be visited only if time is there,"There is nothing great here. Ether one can cover this war memorial when opting for the Joy Ride or go separately. The entry ticket is priced at INR 30/ person. There are telescopes and people can have a look at some of the prominent buildings of Darjeeling by paying INR 30 for one person. The lace acks food stalls. However, there are momo stalls outside on the roadside."
A beautiful War Memorial dedicated to the Gorkha Soldiers with a magnificent view of the Kanchendzonga,"The Batasia loop is truly one of the most beautiful visiting spots in Darjeeling. Not only is it a one of a kind war memorial in India but also provides a magnificent viewpoint of the superb Kanchenjunga mountain range. It is definitely a must see for every tourist. However, there was a lot of construction going on around the memorial when we visited this site which made the place very dusty.We also witnessed the famous toy/steam train that went right by us. It was quite a fascinating sight for us. And we also faced our first experience of a lot of coal dirt being emitted on us which was quite a sight to behold :) :).We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Gurkha War Memorial/ Batasia Loop and we strongly recommend every tourist to visit this wonderful sightseeing point!!!"
Lovely,You get 15 minutes stop here in the toy train. Worth visiting. Names all heroes of Army.Good memorial
Panoramic view of Kanchendzonga,Must visit this place once. It gives panoramic view of the mountain peaks in in India and Nepal. Lovely place.
Beautiful,You can see the Mt Kanchenjunga range from the place. The toy train halts at the place and takes a loop. A very beautiful and picturesque location. Do try momos there.
Scenic spot,This os a very scenic spot located on the steam train ride from Darjeeling to Ghum. The place also shows us the ingenuity of the engineers who built the railway line.
"Beautiful garden, war memorial","The garden is well maintained, with various colorful flowers. The Darjeeling Toy Train passes right through the garden, and we managed to catch a glimpse of it. Local attire (what the tea pluckers wear) is available on rent, can be worn on top of our clothes."
Batasia Loop,Batasia Loop is near Ghum Railway Station which one can go by a taxi or take the short ride in the steam engine train from Darjeeling Station. It is basically a view point with a war memorial and a nice garden. One can also see Mt Kanchenjunga from here.
"Toy train,  Memorial and Culture :)",it was a very chilling morning while we visited thr... it ws cold and very scenic as we saw kanchenjanga from thr cleary... Beautiful garden with toy train tracks....  street food was awsm
Soldiers monument and Darjeeling Train!,The soldier's monument is really good. The standing Gorkha with all the names of the martyrs of all wars against the backdrop of the fantastic view and the indian flag. Batasia loop is also a station for the Darjeeling Himalayan Train which halts there.
Just good view,"It's like a part to take pictures and enjoy the view. Nothing more than that. Some local allow you to look through telescopes for Rs. 30... for 1 minute, pointing out some so called interesting places (no clue how much is true). There is a war memorial which touches you since it gives you an understanding of how many people sacrificed their lives for the country. There is an entry ticket and watch out for the train passing through."
View of mountain,"this place is known for its view of mountain, photo in old tradition dress of locals, toy train ride. thats all you can do here. toy train ride is little over priced."
Toy Train Ride (Steam Engine),"We took a ride on Toy train to Dhoom , Steam Engine driven and came out wondoring as why this service (with steam Engine) is still being Run! It is distratous making huge noise, emitting coal dust , blackening all your clothes!  and not to mention polluting smoke coming out of train. The train route passes right thru narrow lanes of city showing shope and hoses on both sides of track. And if it is Foggy (took 4.00 pm ride- in April 2018) No views! Only what you get is 10 minutes at Garden! Most of tourist take this ride with assumption that this is the train used for Song Shoot in one of the yesteryear popular Hindi film ""Aradhana""! How mistaken they are. NHR should immediately stop this (steam)  and as well as Diesel engine service. You just need to look around the world the experience of travelling in the ""Scenic"" trains and what views and beauties they really offer! I am planning to forward some Special photographs"" to ministry of Railways !Friends! This is nothing but a government organised ""Tourist Trap"" Fall in it at Your Own Risk! You have forewarned! (which nobody did to us, What a waste of Money & Time). rain ride to Dhum & Back :"
Nice little garden,"If you book the joyride, no need to visit this separately since joyride stops here for 10 mins. Offers nice views of mountains."
Heritage Railway,"This place is near Ghum Station on New Jalpaiguri (NJP)-Darjeeling rail route. Built by British in 1881 to facilitate trade of tea (primarily), it is an engineering marvel by its own merit. You will wonder how such a small engine negotiates the terrain of the hill. Engineers of the day employed some techniques like reverses and loops. Best is, when you see it crisscrossing the motor way that runs parallel to it.Batasia Loop is the most famous among 4/5 loops that are there is this route. Due to forbidding cost of operation and maintenance, there is only one train from NJP to Darjeeling and vice-versa. For tourists however, there are 7/8 trains which run on a circular trip from Darjeeling to Ghum and back.Cost of ticket is very high. But you do feel very excited, nostalgic and kind or romantic to see it chug along. The train stops at Batasia loop for people to take a look at Darjeeling Town through telescopes or simply to enjoy the garden. There's a war memorial in memory of martyred Gorkha Regiment soldiers.You take a taxi to go there from Darjeeling. There's a token fee for admission here."
Batasia loop ,Nothing is there .But u can surely time pass 30 min by clicking photos with family n friends...It's on the way to Darjeeling so one can stop n enjoy
Engineering marvel,A feat of engineering precision and a jewel in Darjeeling heritage. The loop now houses beautiful Garden landscape and a war Memorial. There is also a view point where Binocular are available @ rupees 30 per head. Must see places in Darjeeling.
Can be skipped,"For lazy people who can't wake to see sunrise from tiger hills, this place serves as an alternate to view Kanchenjunga provided the sky is clear."
Ghastly run down piece of history,Many gentleman of a certain age obviously loved this trip. For us we found the compartments filthy. As soon as the train set off we found it difficult to breathe. When we got to the hill destination everything was covered in soot and the air was difficult to breathe. We couldn’t wait to get off as this is a health hazard.
Good for few clicks and thats where the story ends,The loop is supposed to be an Engineering marvel in the bygone era as the track elevates by over 10 feet in one loop. There is an entry ticket to this attraction. You can see a small war memorial there and the loop. can get yourself clicked for a couple of photos with the train or the DHR poster. But nothing beyond that.
it is ok ride,"Fun for kids, one can visit the loop by having a toy train joy ride rather than visiting the loop separately."
A fantastic park at the mountain top where the toy train takes a pause,The views from the park is spectacular. The shops sell local goodies. Overall must-see while in Darjeeling.
Extraordinary Views and Great to watch in Binoculars,You can watch views from top and there are Binoculars at Rs.30/- per person where they will zoom each place and explain you everything. Don't go by Toy Train and visit separately so that you can enjoy the views by spending ample time.
A must visit..If you are in Darjeeling..preferring a joy ride get things more charming,On 6th March 2018 we three friends visit Batasia loop. We select a steam joy ride from Darjeeling for that.You just take joy ride from Darjeeling and on the way to Ghoom this old steam train stops at Batasia loop. We got enough time to spend there and you can capture unforgettable snaps and videos of this beautiful place.Old era steam train in the background will give marvelous charm to your pictures.
Peaceful place,"Everytime I go to Darjeeling, I always go and see this place.The name Batasia loop comes from  steam engine making a curvey loop which almost looks like figure 8.The place is quiet until a steam engine comes in puffing white clouds and whistling, it is the best time to take picture which just looks brilliant..  Good environment overall and the main thing is the place also has a magnificent statue of a Gurkha soldier and engraved names of fallen soldiers on the wall."
Stoppage on Toy/Joy Ride journey,We never planned to visit this separately however on our Joy Ride journey this was one of the stoppage. Nothing special and it was under renovation so we could not visit the main statue as well.
Overhyped over rated place,Nothing much special about this place. You have good view of Darjeeling town. A small market offering photos in traditional dresses.
Steam Engine,If you are lucky you can watch Toy train run by your side. very near to city center. Engineering fit of 19th century.
Great view,It offers the great view and its one of the stop on your toy train joyride. You have an option to dress in local attire
Not worth place to visit,"I didn't find this place worth to visit in darjeeling. However, this is my personal view and choice varies from person to person. There is nothing to view there. Only thing is that you will see a loop of narrow gauge railway track of Himaliyan Railway which is often seen everywhere in darjeeling. But if you are going to darjeeling then you can visit but in case of scarcity of time, you can definitely skip this place."
Beautiful place ,Pleasant visit to this iconic spot.. it was warm with a lovely breeze blowing.. spent about 20 minutes looking around. Well maintained and clean
Can be visited,This place can be visited if it is on the way. Nothing special. Just a loop of train track. View is ok
Nice place to visit in Darjeeling,"Batasia loop is basically a spiral track for the toy train. It is circular in shape with a war memorial at the middle of the circle. You can reach Batasia  Loop in two different ways. First is, you can book the toy train joyride from Darjeeling. It's am two hour long ride starting and ending at Darjeeling only. On its way it stops at Batasia Loop and Ghum station and then comes back at Darjeeling. Or you can take a cab to Batasia Loop in which case you have to purchase entry tickets worth INR 15. There's flower garden inside and you can pise for photographs sitting or standing on the railway tracks."
Toy train and Batasia Loop - nostalgia,Take a joy ride and visit the Batasia Loop. Though this time (I have visited many times in my childhood - typical Bengali summer vacation trip) I found it to be dirty.
Loop your memories,"the place whihc you wld have seen in all movies/ scenary post cards, etc whenever they refer darjeeling, you can go and give a visit to this place and click some pictures . Also you can hire traditional gorkha dress and click family pictures as mementos.little shops are there at entrance where u can have some yumm snacks to munch .the toy train stops here in the loop be ready with your camera and keep clicking."
A stroll along batasia loop,Batasia loop is an elevated structure near Ghoom railway station on Darjeeling Himalayan train route. Here toy train completes a full loop around its track before exiting through a tunnel below. Its developed as a recreational area and also has Gorkha war memorial in it. We visited in early morning.There were vendors offering view of darjeeling as well as Sikkim through binoculars. You can also try out traditional costume photography.  Due to cloudy weather we could not get a view of Kanchanjunga mountains otherwise clearly visible from here. So we took a stroll along the loop and enjoyed hot pakoras sold at stalls near exit.
Very average,"It is just a garden which is packed with people, which means that one can't get a nice clear pic as well. Very average, and can be given a pass as well ! There is an entry fee associated with this place."
toy train,"we took a return trip int he toy train from darjeeling -ghum- darjeeling, the batasia loop is a very good place to stop and take photos on the way to ghum , it was a lot of fun for our daughter"
Visit during the toy train ride,"Batasia loop was visited during the toy train ride to ghoom station. This is strategically important as the train literally takes a U turn from here on the incline. Do read about it before going, you will enjoy it more"
Good place for small tour,"We visited this place as part of the travel package we get. After we visit Tiger garden, we came down to this place. It's a small place with some natural beauty situated around the statue which was built for the memories of brave dead soldiers. You will have the opportunity to wear local dresses and capture some snaps in exchange of some money. You also can enjoy views with binocular for some money. You have buy tickets for entering in to this place; 15 rupees for each adult. If you are hungry you can taste local street foods before entering the place; the street food stall is located just in front of the entering zone."
Toy Train 360 degree loop,here the toy train takes a round turn. Train stops here for sometime for visitors to see the Batasia Gardens that is a well maintained War Memorial.Quite neat and clean.A unique rail technology in the hills
Tribute to Gorkha Regiment,"The place offers tribute to Gorkha Regiment. Gorkhas have been famous for their valour, strength, agility and fighting skills.The place is well maintained and near Ghoom station. But one can skip the place if he/she is on tight schedule. There is nothing much to explore."
Historic but better to skip,"Located approximately 4 km from taxi stand, this place has historic importance . However there nothing more to explore this place . Better skip this place and take rest from travelling."
Nice view point,"This is a nice view point and war memorial a short, pleasant walk from Ghum Station. The Darjeeling Heritage Railway train makes a loop within a short curve downwards and goes onwards to Darjeeling. The surrounding hills offer wonderful views on a clear day and there is a nice garden to sit and get some pictures to carry pleasant memories."
Nothing just a round garden,"Visited after taking Re.15 ticket, realized later no need to take ticket, the same would be covered in toy train rideJust a round park, well maintained. witness kanchanjunga from here. and whole darjeelingenjoy hot pakodas outside to quench your cold."
Toy Train Ride is Superb.....,Batasia Loop is always in mist. Toy train in which people can travel is really a major attraction as it rides through a mist which is very lovely to watch and to travel. Lovely green gardens make the mind very relaxed and peaceful. Must pay a visit as a family.
Halted here in the heritage train,"The heritage train has a 10-min halt here and we explored this place. Saw the staff stoking the engine. The view from here is excellent. However, due to cold, the grass had died."
Batasia loop ,A beautiful place. You can see the kunchunjunga mountain range from here and that too sitting on the toy train .Too good
Batasia Loop,It is a historic place and the Rail Loop is famous for it's shape and view. It is the Highest heritage railway station in the world. Nice place to visit and it really enjoyable to sit the the train with friends. Batasia loop is nice location and tourist sightseeing
Nice view,"This is 2 km away from city, a nice and cool point to view. The heritage train takes a round from here after visiting ghoom station. That's why it is called batasia loop. Monks were awesome here.. Must try."
Toy Train,"If you are in Darjeeling, don't you miss toy train ride.  It's a must and as it is A UNESCO World Heritage status we as Indian should be proud of the fact as well!  The time limit of staying was very less (I felt) but worth a visit.  My children loved it!"
Batasia Loop,"Beautuful place with wonderful views and beautiful flowers, The memoires of the soliders was good.  The gardens there are beautiful"
Can be skipped absolutely unless you have nothing else to do!,"I went to see this place just because it was at walking distance from my homestay in darjeeling.It is not going to take more than 10 minutes to see batasia loop. People visit this place mostly to just read about the history of this place (engraved on a stone at entrance) and get fancy pictures clicked near loop (rail track)An okaying passtime, toy train can be very well seen while walking down the lane to batasia loop. Wont recommend it as a “must see” though! There are better things to do in darjeeling :)"
Must visit,The famous toy train which is also UNESCO Heritage site takes a loop at this place. On a clear day Kanchenjungha looks amazing from here
Ingenious Marvel ,"On DHR, at Ghoom, once highest railway station in world, this loop product of intelligence of engineers.  When 90 degree turn was impossible for train, they created a loop-- track built above the track! Must see to understand and appreciate. Here is also located Gorkha Martyrs Memorial, commemorative of every Gorkha who fell defending Nation."
360 degree view of Darjeeling's landscape,"Must visit place in Darjeeling. It will give a 360 view of Darjeeling, especially the Mountain Peak view. We walked around the area. There are small markets inside the loop. You will get a chance to take a photo in the traditional dress from there. In the centre you can see the war memorial, of the Gorkha soldiers who sacrificed their lives in various wars. You can take a joy ride in the toy train also. There are markets outside of the loop. Shops for bags, hats and Jackets all available there, you can have breakfast also."
Batasia loop: a good view point and Gorkha war memorial,"We visited this place in winter on 25.12.2017. it is mainly a war memorial and the very good view point of Mt. Kanchenjunga. Here you can wear Gorkha Lepcha  uniform and take snap shots( Rs.50/-per head). The name Batasia loop is originated from century back .Actually British Ruler cannot bear the Hot of India. They usually used this place(Darjeeling) to spend some good moments. Hence they established the great Narrow Gauge ( i.e distance bet. two rails is 01 metre). That’s why you can see here western culture, western school colleges etc. the word loop mean turn, here narrow gauge steam engines are used the turn or reversed its direction century before. After that it is formed as a gorkha war memorial , a pillar and a statue of soldier made of black stone constructed here.If you use joy ride from Ghum then at batasia is free, otherwise to see this park you should charge Rs.15/- per head. Joy ride trains( Rs.800/- for diesel engine and Rs.1200/- for steam engine) actually stops here for 20 minutes and then turned back for Ghum again.At sunny weather its view really amazing. You can see whole Kanchejunga Range from here."
Should be on must visit places list of Darjeeling,"The Batasia Loop, just like all other places in Darjeeling, rewinds the clock for you and takes you back a few decades. The war memorial and the toy train loop, along with the stunning Kanchenjunga views, are why you should definitely visit this place"
Good,Its  the place where the train turns. Nothing great in that. But its developed into a garden now. Hot but pleasant.
Gorkha War Memorial and Darjeeling Heritage Train Halt,"1) Batasia Loop is a railway siding on Darjeeling Heritage Railway track from Darjeeling to Ghum. Earlier here the trains could be turned back or reversed, hence loop.2) The heritage train takes a 10 min stop here and we can see the well maintained garden and the Gorkha War Memorial created here.3) It has entry ticket if you visit separately but the same is included if you travel by the heritage train.4) We travelled in April and the weather was cool & foggy, so we enjoyed the stop and view of Darjeeling.5) Tip - This can be seen along with the heritage train ride but not necessary separately."
Batasia,"A nice place with beautiful views. A memorial built for gallant soldiers. Entry fee is 15/-. The toy train goes through this loop.No parking, vehicles need to be parked on road alongside.Views with telescope available inside."
Loop War Memorial Toy Train and Mountain,"We visited this place in winter and very much liked the place. The loop was created to overcome sudden uphill journey of the toy train. Latter Gorkha War Memorial was created here. This is a beautiful place. On a sunny day one can take photograph with War Memorial infront of Kanchanjungha range. If you get a toy train passing by, it is great. Here people can take photograph with traditional dress."
nice place for photographs with traditional dresses,It has a loop from where the toy train does a U-turn.  It has a war memorial too. Nice place to take photographs.
A stoppage in the joyride,Nothing special barring a great viewpoint of darjeeling town. Located in between darjeeling and ghum. The steam engine joyride will stop here for 10 minutes. A round area with gardens and an army monument in the centre of it. Could skip if time is not available.
An average place ,"It a Gorkha worrier's memorial place and has got small garden with a loop of track for you train, the toy train halts here and you can have beautiful view of Mt. Kunchanjanga from here ..."
A good viewpoint,This place is a good viewpoint for the Kanchenjunga mountain. It is also the gurkha war memorial. May visit this place
A park...,We were lucky that the mountain stayed visible all day so the stop at this little park as part of the toy train 'joy rude' was pretty cool.I guess other than that the views are pretty nice and the ghurka memorial is a nice thing.
toy train,You will enjoy the toy train when it passes the loop and the narrow gauge and vintage train you will enjoy.
