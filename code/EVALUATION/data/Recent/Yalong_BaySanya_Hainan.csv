Nice and clean,"Yalong is supposed to be one of the best beaches on hainan and it truly meets expectation. Clean beach, walk into the ocean for miles without having to swim.The currents however can be quite strong from time to time.Offering jet ski service, banana boat etc."
Picture perfect,"Clear water and clean beaches, no hoards of tourists, perfection. Loved it here. The hotels along the beach all have great bars and drinks, makes me really feel like I’ve stepped out of China and into a tropical paradise!"
Vacation ,A good relaxing beach vacation. Great food. Clean beach. Nice place to relax. A great mix of diverse food.
Great spot,"If you are going to do a tour of China, definitely put Sanya on your short list. We’ve stayed at a couple of different areas in Sanya. Yalong Bay has great views and clean water. There’s some food options but if you want more selection plan to visit the “summer” mall area."
Nice waves in the water,"Its a nice place to go and see. Bus no. 25 takes you there but no more buses to go to any other place after 7pm. The taxi costs 70 rmb to or from the sanya bay. A lot of chinese tourists doing all kind of water activities. There are no palms on the beach side sand, like anywhere on  Sanyas  beaches, too hot to be a full afternoon at the beach side unless you find an umbrella which some places let you use for free."
Beautiful ,"This area is so so beautiful , this is one of the best areas to stay in Sanya so many great hotels and the beech is lovely ."
Not much to do!,"If you're not staying at a resort there, don't worry too much about going; maybe go one day. Sanya's where you want to be, near the Dadonghai Beach. All there is to Yalong Bay are resorts and food court."
Nice Beach ,We where staying at the Marriott which had direct access to the beach. The Beach is nice and clean and well looked after.
"Nice sand and water, too many water sports and vendors","Happy to find a beach in Sanya that allows year-round swimming. A little disappointed by the overcrowding of water sports and commercialization. Nearly impossible to snorkel with all the boats and vendors. Nice sand and water, especially at the MGM Grand Sanya."
The art of the sea,"Beautiful artwork cast onto the beach by the sea. Some where out for a relaxing beach walk, while others where pulling in their nets with a nice catch of assorted sea-life."
Beach visit on Symmetrical Day . . . 20200202,"Few people were at the beach on Symmetrical Day, 20200202, being year 2020, second month (February, 02), and second day (02). Normally during Spring Festival, the beach would b crowded. This year, due to the coronavirus crisis, 98% of the usual visitors obeyed the travel ban, and stayed away."
Interesting ,We go on the beach for drive and water sports. It’s interesting. Recommend. Good place for long walk. White beach and clean sea. A lot of tourists but you have a lot of place for dinner).
Beautiful beach,"Our friends had recommended us Yalong bay beach, so we had to see it. It was a beautiful beach. Compared to Sanya beach there were also some bars, water sports  and more people in the beach. However, it was just a beach with a view."
Best beach in sanya,"IMO- the Yalong bay  beach area is the best.  It might not be the newest ( Haitang is the newest & has the duty free mall)  But for activity & food options Yalong is the best, even better than the city Dadonghai area ( mostly the older beach area).Yalong has a mix of chinese & western hotels, some on the beach & several on the main road area + two great golf courses.The St Regis has a marina & about a mile of totally private beach's"
Lovely beach,"Beautiful beach. We had long walks along the beach, frequently strolling into the water. One of the better and more famous beaches in China."
Nice beach in Hainan ,"This is no tropical paradise but still a nice beach, a lot quieter than some other beaches in the vicinity, with a beautiful mountain backdrop.It’s a long beach the middle part is busy not overly so but plenty of beach vendors selling water sport activities and bizarrely photographers offering their services seems to be very popular with the Chinese.Most of the upmarket hotels are located here so beach is clean and pristine, getting more rustic towards the top end, towards Gangtou where it becomes more rocky.Sea looked inviting but looked very rough when I was staying and red flags were continually flying and the beach drops down very sharply.Very relaxing beach to spend the day on."
Beautiful Beach on the South China Sea,"Clear blue water, very clean. Walking on the sandy beach is must in the evening as the sun comes down."
It's really liek this the sea in China?,"Wow, the sea was clear and blue, never expected to find such a great sea in China, obviously the problem was another, the beach full of attraction, unfortunately this is the reason"
The best beach on Hainan!,"A very quiet, clean and beautiful bay. Vast beach side provide a very convinient way to the sea, special zone for swimming are indicated with floats. No roks, no corals, only gentle sand!In comparison with other Sanya bays, here you will not find so much litter, thouth the area closer to the central Yalong wan square and Totem could have ben more cleaner.Also there are no entertaining facilities by the beach, so you can have a real rest from noise. If you look for more comfort, go to the right closer to luxurious hotels - all the sunbeds are free there!"
Very nice over all,"I gave this part of Sanya four stars.  I would love to give it five, but as with so many other places in China there is a lot of trash everywhere.  The trash laying on the beach and in the public areas detract from the nice areas.  Perhaps there are not enough garbage cans around or they are more than 5 meters away from those throwing the trash on the ground, but I do not like to see litter everywhere.  The water was rough the days we where there, but that is not the fault of people.  There is no control over the ocean waves.  We were not allowed to wade out into the water past our knees.But the sunset and the sunrise are nearly breath taking.  These are some beautiful moments in life you do not want to miss."
"Benign, clean beach","We swam in Yalong Bay a few times, but as someone who enjoys a few waves, it becomes pretty dull. The water is warm and clean, and the hotels all offer acquatic activities from floating on blow up ring to jet-Skiing to banana boating. La Floret offers some minor nightlife (I did like the brewery there), but next I’ll stay in Sanya or Haitang Bay."
Excellent beach,"Yalong bay is a public beach, therefore everyone can go regardless of whether they are staying in one of the hotels. We were staying in hotel but we went to the beaches of all the hotels along the strip before or after having dinner in their restaurants. I was constantly surprised and impressed by this beach. It was beautiful of course, white sand clear water etc. but it was also EMPTY during the heat of the day. We went at 2-4pm several days and sometimes only saw one or two other families or couples! After 4 it picked up but was still very calm! Sometimes the waves were big, like waves you could ride if you had a buggy board or wanted to body surf and other days the waves were really mild. It seems regardless of the whether, the red flags are up warning you to only swim in the designated, roped off and “safe” swimming areas. This wasn’t really a problem as mentioned previously, there were hardly any people so there was always plenty of space to swim and relax. As much as I disliked the Hilton’s “beach buffet”, their actual beach was my favorite. They have a long line of chairs with umbrellas. The lounge chairs had no cushions but also had nothing blocking the view and sea breeze. The Marriott also had a nice beach but there were too many chairs all crowded together. Their staff was more attentive, cleaning the chairs cushions and disposing of garbage etc. the Ritz beach was very picturesque but no chairs on the actual beach, no shade, and some strange concrete things that looked dangerous."
Nice Beach,Nice food and relaxed environment. If you are coming with family and friends you will certainly find everything that you need
Watch for the paparazzi ,"Travelling in China as someone with African features and sporting my natural hair ca sometimes be a challenge! In China black people are often seen as something of a novelty! Going to the beaches makes this more obvious as people forgot what they were doing to take photos of me - even though I was fully clothed. I can just imagine if I had worn a bikini! Apart from that, the beach was nice if the water currents are a bit strong. It’s well patrolled by lifeguards and there’s lots of activities you can sign up for. It’s easy to get there by Didi taxi or even the buses and regular cabs. Food is a bit bland and overpriced (for China so still pretty affordable)."
Not what I expects,"Beach is full of small peace of stone,really thin beach, full of people, overprice food low quality. I saw the aquarium, where you chose seefood in restaurant, and there was two dead fish... Brr. Every inscription or menu are in chinnes (ok) and russian!! Language- no english and noone does not speak englis, so use offline google translation.If you take good food you must go to small corner of street in city. I will try post some references in other review"
Nothing,Nothing here. This place is about nothing. Reminds of popular sitcom Seinfeld. Steere clear of this way
a land of relaxation,"To me, travel is sort of a relaxing activity rather than a ‘going everywhere’ activity. So, the I’m going to talk about probably the best place to relax in China.The best place I know is probably Sanya. It has beautiful beaches, amazing hotels, and great fruits since it has tropical climates. I go to Sanya for nearly every year, and it won’t cost much for a 1-week trip, 7500RMB is already enough. Usually, I’ll go to YaLong Bay and stay at a hotel named TianYu Hotel for 5-7 days. Meanwhile, there’s a small pedestrian mall near the hotel, and it’s a really good place to wander around. In the hotel, there are restaurants, but I don’t really recommend eating there since it’s really expensive. But if you enjoy so I won’t stop you.The beach is the best part to tell, since if there’s sea there should be a reasonably sized beach. It contains really pure, smooth sand, and is sure to enjoy. Down in the sea, there will be lots of fun too since the waves are really fun to play with."
Breakfast to lunch,I am very thankful to the big kitchen..They served me very well with the varities of food and i like beef noodles very much...it is severed with many spicy and tangy flavour pickles and also delicisious pastry and bread which there was many varities and also i am pleased with service more because the service was very good which i like the most.. and her name is Alina magar....i m very thankful to the chef who made very delicisious food and  comfortness that i ever had ...once again thankyou soo much for making my day.
A piece of heaven,I loved it. Loved everything about my experience in Sanya last week. It was a great escape from the cold of Hangzhou
China Vacation,"Beautiful place, rightfully referred to as China’s Hawaii. We were the only foreigners at the Hilton Sanya Yalong Bay hotel. Everybody made us feel welcomed. Our visit to Sanya was most memorable."
Day excursion,"Halong Bay differs from Sanya Bay, the water is rougher and the waves a little higher. Situated on the southern shore of the island, it has a number of international branded hotels and resorts access to amazing local food and if you want to shop, they have as well."
Christmas Day on the Beach,"This is great place to visit the beach. Lovely scenery with mountains, tropical rainforest and palm trees.The beach is accessible through the hotels or a public access although I think you need to pay to enter.The beach is clean and has a soft fine sand above the tide line. The sand below the tide line is soft and you can build sandcastles. The slope is steep and old people may need to take care in places but we spent the whole day on the beach.There are strong currents so you have to use the swimming areas.Sailing and boats are available.Jet ski's too although they do make noise and they like to show off!!The sea seems clean and good for swimming in.We will come again to this area again.It is suitable for families, friends or couples."
Beautiful Scenery ,"Our first stop in Sanya. Most of the high end beach resorts line the coast of this bay. We went to Yalong Bay central square which has a slew of seafood restaurants that serve live catches. There is also a fresh seafood market where you can purchase the livestock and bring over to any of the restaurants and have cooked to the style you want at a fee. There is a totem pole artifact thats picturesque for nice photo shots especially with rhe back drop of the sea and blue sky. It will look especially nice during sunset. The beach itself is accessible from here. The beach has deck chairs for use and also water sport activites like jet skis, para sailing and bannana boats. We did not try any as we did not have spare change of clothes for the kids and we found it reletively pricey for what you could get near our neighbouring country of Malaysia. The view of the beach is stunning and serene. On our next trip here, we'll make it a point to stay at one of the hotels here as pricw wise, its actually a bargain to what you can get at anynother beach resorts."
Nice Beach,Clean Beach with a bunch of Five star hotels. Good for tanning. As good a beach that you will find in China.
Who doesn’t like free beach 🏖 tanning re,"This beach was one of the best. With great ocean. Too many eateries. All the branded luxury hotels, with all the foreigners all around you, yes you heard me very few locals. Food is expensive obviously 🙄, but it’s a good place to chill when you are staying nearby"
Very crowded even on a weekday ,"I visited yalong Bay on a Tuesday and it was packed with tourists! there are many water activities available eg banana boat, parasailing though I did not try any of them as they were quite expensive. there are better deals on Philippines/ Malaysia. there are sun benches provided for free that you can lie in and watch the world go by though every 5 minutes someone will try to sell you the water activities/ fruits. sunset in the evening was beautiful.at night we had dinner at the seafood restaurant where you got to buy your own seafood at the market and bring it to the restaurant for them to cook. pls note that both sides charge a fee. food is alright, fresh and not too expensive. our dinner cost about 250rmb in total."
Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach, and clean. Fun water sports for a fair price. Went parasailing for RMB360 per person."
Just a nice beach,"It is just a nice beach with white sand. In south East Asia you can find much better place, but if you are for some reason in Sanya, this is the better place where to swim.I suggest to spend one or two nights in one of the many beautiful resorts on this beach to enjoy at most.If you are coming here for a low budget vacation, change your plans.This is not a tropical paradise and this is not a cheap place. If you go on the free beach, you can find it also dirty. Came here only to relax in one resort and to use its private beach that for sure will be clean."
Nice beach outside Sanya,Absulutely worth a trip fromSanya. Nice beach with loads of different five star hotels. Good for Chinese and Westerners.
About as good as you'll get in Sanya,This is probably the best of the beaches available in the Sanya area. Considerably cleaner and more attractive than Dadonghai or the main Sanya Bay. Wasn't too crowded when I visited. Downside is that it's a considerable trek from the city centre.
A very spacious park consisting of both beach and rides,"Yalong Bay does not only consist of a beach by itself, but it encompasses an entire Tourism Zone that is still to be expanded, which includes or shall include seaside parks, hotels, theme parks, conference centers, and a golf course, to name just a few. During my visit though, my family and I managed to walk through some of the existing rides which were already in operations at the park (e.g. a carousel, Pirate ship, etc.), as well as along the beautiful white sands of its famous Yalong Bay beach itself. The beach is extremely popular with tourists and holiday-ers, most of whom were there to escape the cold weather in their respective countries and bask in the warm waters of Sanya. Bathrooms are even provided for the convenience of swimmers there.Overall, this would be a good place to visit for visitors to Sanya, and based on the available attractions there at the moment, you should expect to spend at least half a day there."
Simple park,"If you are waiting for your flight, you can stop here to just roaming around. Stores here are still for completion.Some are for renovation and some are already open for business. They have  statue of teddy bear, hotels and food chain nearby."
Hot place for going ,"I go there on end of Jun, weather is very Hot , I go for two time ,due afternoon too hot but I also can see Many tourist go for Swin and playing, and I go again on evening time, they really beauty for the beach and I really enjoy for weather evening and nice beach"
One of best beaches in Sanya,"If you want relaxing holidays far from city with nice beach - Yalong bay is right choice. A lot of hotels - Marriott, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, MGM and etc are here. Make sure hotel has access to the beach and it is not too old. Many hotels built here 10 years ago and recently renovated. Have many restaurants as well. Around 1 hour from airport."
Less people in the sea,"Not so many people in the sea, so easy to swim. Sometimes the jet boat is coming closer. Guard is taking care so much even if it's not so big wave so keeping safe so much."
"Nice beach, kids love it and play","Beach is nice. Sand is soft. Good for kids but no one allow to swim in late of Jun. If you want to snorkeling, please try Dadonghai"
Nice place,"We have been in Sanya 3 times, this is the first time we decided to rent a car and drive buy . The beaches are very nice ! Not t very crowded at this time of the year ! With a very few western faces like us , the local shops only have people speaking Chinese and accepting local credit cards , what is not so easy for foreigners like us! But it was a very nice ride along the bay !"
Nothing to see,"Overcrowded beaches, very expensive shopping and average restaurants. To kill an afternoon why not but really not a Sanya Highlight."
visit,good place for travell and food experince more facility and visit once to enjoy the true nature of southern part.
Best beach in Sanya,"One of best and Nice Beach in China. Yalong Bay is beautiful and there is so much to do here. Banana boats, diving, swimming, beachcombing, just laying in the sun, shopping, everything I like to have at or near the beach. The weather was amazing, and the water so refreshing!"
A wooden safety box cost 50 in local money,"Maybe I was tricked, I do not know. I am thinking: why would a local pay 50 for this ""service""? Anyway. Lovely beach. Very clean. The mansions around look very posh to me. A bit hard to find the public entrance to the beach. It is by the town centre. A very small path between the shops. There are signs in Chinese, Russian and sometimes English. I recommend doing what I do: DIY. Rent a bike or a car or use a local bus. Don't pay some shark money to go there ""the tourist way"" 😀"
It is a very nice bay.,"The view is pretty, the sand is fine, and the water is clear and blue. I think it is not far from Hawaii."
Nice beach area,"The water is clean and not that many tourist where we stay, the view was beautiful, hard to imagine with so many people visited every year, they keep the place nice and clean."
"Nice water and sand but  overpriced, full and noisy","It's only OK if you live in China and want to spend couple of days on the beach (and you can't go to Thailand or Philippines) Otherwise, avoid Sanya. For me, it is very difficult to deal with noisy and dirty Chinese. Everything is expensive in Yalong bay. Do not try to do any 1/2 day trip such as Tropical Paradise Forest Park because it is only for Chinese; no-one will give you a map in English and you'll have to deal with a guide speaking Chinese on a microphone all the time. Save money and time, do not go to Wuzhizhu Coral island either. Just stay at the hotel and try to relax (if you can)"
Nice beaches ,We have been going to Yalong bay nearly every time we go to Sanya over the last 17 years.  That in itself should say a lot. ;-). It’s a pleasant place with nice clean sandy beaches.  No big waves usually just fairly calm clean water
Relaxing...,"Yalong Bay reminds me of Bota Fogo in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A two way wide avenue and walking promenade separate the beach from the many residential buildings and hotels. Very pretty."
"Overrated, crowded ","Lots of older hotels all cookie-cutter-like crowded together, bad traffic too. We went to visit a fried at the mongrove tree, looked like it was from the 60s... nice kids playground indoor and out door"
Crystal clear waters at clean coral sand beach buy the luxurious Hotels,"Clean coral sand beach buy the luxurious Hotels. Crystal clear waters at clean coral sand beach buy the luxurious Hotels are more than enough. You can use some bar services, so then you can use facilities no proplem."
Yalong Bay-A very beautiful location,It was worth the visit. It was one of the attractions on our tour. The South China Sea is very nice and we were able to wade in the surf.
Soon to be a very popular town,Taking bay is what I imagine Honolulu was 30 years ago. With quite a lot of world class 5 star resorts in town and some excellent bars clubs and restaurants I’m quite confident that anyone who visits will enjoy it as much as I did
The reason to come to Sanya,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton at Yalong bay. The beach in front of the Ritz is not a private beach, but it is relatively quiet as the Chinese do not do much sunbathing. It is a very long and clean beach and the water is clear, but (in January ) too cold to swim. The beach faces South and is bordered inland by a mountain range, which makes the area quite scenic. Very nice to take a long walk on the beach, going West towards the lighthouse the beach is very quiet but gets a rocky. Towards the East is a long strip of beach with resorts with private parts of the beach. There is a little center nearby with quite a few shops and decent restaurants (10 mom by taxi) where there is a variety of food options. If you come to Sanya as a tourist, this beach must be the reason."
Very long sandy beach,"Yalong Bay has a very long beautiful sandy beach, with many very large resort style hotels along it.  This is perfect if you want to stay at an upmarket resort and not do much sightseeing, as there is not much of an actual town here and the resorts are quite spread out.  We only visited for the day and were unlucky as the wind was howling and the red flags were up advising no swimming."
nice beach,"this is whole area are huge,there are a lot of hotel and Villas around. also a lot of restaurants here. the beach are OK with a bit coarse sand (its painful when the sand blew by wind hitting you)..there are lots of water sport provider here."
Great beach,A bit far out of town but a great beach. Spent an afternoon on the beach at the Ritz Carlton topped off with a couple of beers at their Sands beachside cafe...
Normal beach.,"Not a very tropical feeling beach, just normal. No white sand, no restaurants at all.  Only few spaces for take a bath.  Bath is forbidden after 18.00.  Usually overcrowded."
Nice but overhyped.,"The place itself is pretty nice, even if below the stndards of most Mediterranean beaches. Hype apart, if yuo aren't Chinese you porbably wouldn't enjoy the place much. Nobody at the beach speaks any other language than Mandarine or local dialects (while in the city itself it is easy to find people speaking Russian, for instance), so the most interesting activities will be a challenge to understand, if they let you in. Swimming is barely possible, first because there's a very small stripe of sea you can use for that, while the rest is just for motorboats, and this ludicrously small space is overcrowded with people who probably are more afraid of the water than of the boats themselves. If you even try some apnea a ward will come to call you off. Frankly, Hainan was great, but not because of Yalong Bay."
Perfect Bay to Stay,Excellent hotels and restaurants are crowded in this area. Beaches are perfect. The water quality is better than other areas in Sanya.
Nice bay area,With a little bit of fantasy and some foresight into the next decade... this could become Waikiki II in the next years... just a little bit greener and more peaceful
swimming,too far....I stayed near the sea.I visited by taxi to say that this is beautiful.But what is ... different?
Beautiful Beaches,"Excellent beaches! It is difficult to get good food if you don't know Mandarin, though and a bit under developed."
Best beaches in Sanya!,"This is the place if you want to enjoy the beach! Great sand, the sea is warm and beautiful, the hotels look great. We had lunch in the MGM hotel. The restaurant is amazing, everything is delicious."
Easter holidays in Yalong bay,"Hey guys,We went to Yalong Bay as well since its not so far away from Sanya bay. Yalong Bay has more restaurants but is equally beautiful and scenic. I am sure every tourist will love this place. If I get a chance I will love to go visit Sanya Bay again and enjoy my holidays. So guys have fun and enjoy your trip to Sanya Bay or Yalong Bay.Regards,Vicki"
The Paradise of China,"Beach is about 40 minutes from the Phoenix Airport by car. It is a long one with clean white sand, no rocks. The water is so clean.  There are determined areas for swimming protected from water sports equipment. There are umbrellas and sunbeds for free. Unfortunately, there is no bar or kiosk near but there are some sellers passing every 10-15 minutes,  selling drinks and fruits. There are options for a variety of water sports and options to take  you to near islands by fast boats."
Beautiful ,"This bay on Sanya is removed from the hustle of Sanya Bay, peaceful and beautiful. It is about an hour from the main airport."
Nicer beach than Haiang Bay,This beach had whiter sand and cleaner water than where we were staying. Would choose this location if we returned
Holiday,Yalong bay is the more expensive part of the island. The hotels are generally over priced. On the beach you will pay massive over price for activities. Beach is nice warm water and clean. 75 rmb into city in taxi. Get bus lot cheaper.
Best place to stay at Sanya!,"Best place to stay at Sanya! Beautiful and clean beach, good hotels and some places to eat around. Good for kids as well, not very noisy and dusty."
"Nice beach, bad lifeguards ","Beautiful wide beach with warm clear waters. The natural landscape around the bay is nice, but nothing spectacular like some of the beaches in Hawaii or Thailand. If that's what you're expecting, you'll be disappointed. But if you're just looking for a nice beach, as I was, you'll love Yalong Bay. The beach is long enough that everyone can spread out, so you never feel like you're packed too close to other people. Watch out for the lifeguards -- they seem lazy and have terrible attitudes. When we were there, a piece of driftwood bamboo floated ashore and cut my friend's leg. The lifeguards were entirely apathetic and useless, offering nothing but a ""you took the risk of getting in the water"". They didn't even get out of their seats to take the bamboo pole out of the water. The pole was too large for me to carry out of the water on my own. Who knows who else it did or will injure the next time it crashes ashore. Pathetic lifeguards, so make sure you stay safe."
Beautiful,"Quite simply a beautiful beach. The sand is soft on your feet and when the weather is beautiful it's is a great place to relax. One thing I would highlight - you are not allowed to move the sun beds out from underneath the shade into the sunlight, so if you wish to sunbathe (in the sun) you have to lie on the sand with a towel."
Beautiful place. ,Should come to having fun. But never go to the public toilet. I can't breath.Beautiful scenery but it's far to town need rmb 70 or 25 minutesAirport to mgm about rmb130 for a bigger private car.
Nice beach to stay and play,"Stayed right by Yalong bay. Was a great beach for swimming and was quite flat and good for games like soccer or frisbee and theres even a volleyball net. They also have a variety of water sports available. There are a few shops, bars etc that are dotted along the bay and you can get fresh coconuts which is great. There are lots of families and generally lots of people. It can be quite busy at times and so there can be lots of tourists. If your into quiet romantic beaches it may not be the spot for you."
It is not the Bay but the bikes,"To many it might seem amazing that there exists a place to bicycle that is safe and fun. Now if you are here in the winter and the day is not too hot, then there is a great way to get about and see the bay and all the boardwalks. Rent a bike for the day."
Nice big beach,"Nice water for swimming and nice sand, if you are not in one of the big hotels there is nowhere to sit unless you have your own parasol and mats etc, we did get sunbeds under a tree but I think they belonged to a hotel. Bring packed lunch as there are no beach bars to go to for lunch or a drink like we are used to in Thailand, Vietnam etc. Nearby restaurants in shopping centre including Starbucks. It was OK for a few days after touring China. Didn't see any other Europeans."
"Beautifull beach, good to go early",It's good go early and find some free chair and umbrella. Very nice to swim and to watch Chinese families having beach days. The hotels around here looks good.
Nice beach,Went beach strolling... nice and clean beach ;) has a great view and i believe will have a great view for sunrise/sunset too :)
Just another beach,"Nothing impressive for us.Probably we have been living on tropical island all these while, so this bay wasn't that impressive to us."
"Nice beach, clean wather","Nice beach. It wasn't crowded in February. Easy accessible from the downtown by public buses. One way trip takes about 45min. The access is free - from the parking lot where buses terminate. There are bars and souvenir shops around the entrance. Better avoid the public facilities as toilets and changing rooms at entrance which are horrible! You can also get to the beach from the Yalong Bay Holiday Central Plaza (Totem Pole Square). It offers well maintained toilets and changing rooms, but not much more. Not worth the price which is way too high (120/150 CNY)."
So crowded on the beach.,Took Bus25 to Ya Long Wan.  The bus ride was about 1 1/2 hrs from Sanya Bay beach.   I was really disappointed.  If you are staying in the resorts it would be best to choose those with private beach eg. holiday inn.    The beach is so crowded and noisy.  No peace and quiet.   DaDongHai and Sanya Beach was less crowded.
We have been there 2 times. Always want to to back,"We stayed in Sheraton at the 1st time, then Park Hyatt the 2nd time. All of us really really enjoyed this beautiful bay, warm weather in Jan/Feb and of course FOOD!"
Worth the visit,It wasn't busy when I went there at October so it was so relaxing and very worth it. The people were really nice and helpful. Fun to interact with if you know Chinese.
So much fun!,"Yalong Bay is beautiful and there is so much to do here.  Banana boats, diving, swimming, beachcombing, just laying in the sun, shopping, everything I like to have at or near the beach.  The weather was amazing, and the water so refreshing!  There is alot to see in Sanya, so plan accordingly.  I will visit again."
Absolute dream..,"This is the cleanest bay i went in Sanya, compared with other bays. The water is also too clean but in the public area its too crowded. The shopping arcade Baihuagu is very near if you want anything to eat or buy..."
"If you don't speak Mandarin, don't go there!","I was at the St Regis for a few days, playing golf with Chinese business friends. I was put up in one of the Villas, which are very nice in terms of architecture. Their big disadvantage is that the living and sleeping areas are only accessible via ge the garden, meaning that whenever you want to go from one room to the other, doors are locked and you need your key card to get in any of the rooms.I had a few surprising experiences, given this is marketed as a top class resort under the St Regis brand:1. I ordered breakfast to the room, neither the room service telephone operator nor the butler could take an order in English. A French service staff working in one of the restaurant  finally took my order. Food only arrived 90 minutes later, when I was already on the way to golf, all food items were wrapped in cling foil and arrived cold.2. I tried to make a reservation for a car to go sightseeing, all was confirmed for the next day, the car was not there upon the scheduled time of departure, again nine of the many staff spoke enough English or was willing to react to my basic Mandarin (which I acquired from a renowned university in Shanghai and has so Düfte helped me a lot in my 30 years of conducting business in China. Not at the Sanya St Regis, though).3. I had breakfast at the Driftwood Restaurant, was approached by a waiter for warm food items order from a small breakfast menu. I chose fried eggs sunny side up and mushrooms. The order did not arrived, upon asking the waiter (who is very friendly but again shell shocked to react to a foreigner speaking a mix of English and Mandarin) were my order was, I was brought an omelette and a pie.4. Housekeeping staff entered the villa without ringing or knocking at the door, finding me under the shower, and insisting to make up the room in that very moment.I could go on on, but I guess this little list gives the picture.A nice location, good hardware, some willing and friendly staff but over all less than mediocre. Given that my room cost the same than a comparable villa in Phuket or Bali, I recommend to avoid this place unless you speak perfect Mandarin and are willing to accept all kinds of local habits."
Good but expensive ,"Filled with resorts, the area is good to see another beach in Sanya. Not too far from downtown (24 km), accessible through buses. Prices are a bit pumped up but there are places such as mc donald's and kfc who offer still decent prices."
Crowded over weekend,We went in late afternoon on a Sunday. The place is packed with people. Many people were swimming and playing in the sand.Nearby there is a jetty and food is easily available.
clear water,"Yalong Bay is in Sanya, I went to Yalong Bay during the Easter holidays, is the tourist off-season.  water in Yalong Bay  is very clear, very special, the first time I saw such clear water. But I do not like the here, because it is too hot, and very wet, I feel bad mood. And the price of goos in Yalong Bay is very expensive, and Macao is almost, even more expensive than Macao. Just because many tourists, the prices are raised here, so how could passengers be happy? There are many foreign population here, many shops belong to non-native people, they just want to earn money, they did not think about how to attract tourists through local culture. Therefore, I think Sanya is nothing special except the sea-view.In conclusion, I think it is better to go to Thailand than to Sanya. People in Sanya is just want to earn money, does not really care about tourists feelings, and people here are no passion."
Nice place to visit,This is a little more quiet area than Sanya Bay. But I'm my mind to remote. I need action and things to see and do other than sitting in my hotel room. If you like quiet go here. But there are even more quieter than this.  The beach was nice. Free chairs and umbrellas to use but get there early. The bus from downtown Sanya took us there for 11 rmb each.
Average beach,"It is strange that they use float to outline the swimming area. It is like a swimming pool in the beach. The place is crowed. On the other hand, there is no shortage of water sports. You can buy various packages. If can spend nominal amount  ( 10 Yuen ? ) to walk to the harbor. This will give you a peaceful view of the beach without the crowd."
Best beach in Sanya,"Yalong bay has the nicest beaches in Sanya. I only had chance to enjoy beach at Ritz Carlton hotel in Yalong Bay, but if i judge the rest of the bay by this beach i can say it is the best in Sanya."
A must-visit in Sanya,It has large and beautiful beaches. Go there on a sunny weekday ie without many people around. Nice sand and seawaves. Highly relaxing and enjoyable.
Yalong Bay,I was there back in 2005 while living in mainland China. It was a real tropical island dream. I would love to go back there.
"Spotlessly clean, warm sea and white sands...beautiful",This is the beach you must come to if you are visiting Sanya. Not as crowded as the other beaches but by far the best
HIdden gems,"Do yourself a favour and head down to the business area of Sanya either day or night to blend with the locals. There are three distinct areas, one with Starbucks and shops, one with good old Maccas and the third next to the 'waterski' lake that offers a wide range of restaurants.     The food offered is wide and varied, and extremely well priced.   Five dishes of various recipes will cost you about $30-35 AUD and will undoubtedly allow you to come away feeling very satisfied.The trick is to go to the Supermarkets and stock up on drinks and nibbles for your hotel room rather than pay the hotel mini bar prices.   Cans are about $1 and potato chips with interesting  flavours are also similar in price.Well worth a visit...."
Great sunshine,"The Along Bay has the best beach in Sanya, Great Location near the beach,a small shopping center and great restaurants are very closed from the beach.Would recommend for all!"
Wish we would have stayed nearby,"We stayed for a week in Sanya and spent several days at both Dadonghai Bay beach and Yalong Bay beach. It is quite easy to get between the two beaches (take bus number 15 or 24 for about 45 min). We much preferred Yalong Bay. It is more beautiful, more peaceful, less crowded, and just generally much nicer. The beach is free (don't need to be staying at one of the resorts) and there are also free shaded lounge chairs (you have to pay for the chairs on Dadonghai).If you want a busy beach with lots of bars and restaurants, go to Dadonghai. If you want a peaceful and relaxing beach, go to Yalong Bay. Our biggest regret in Sanya was not staying in Yalong Bay."
Scenic beauty,"A drive to Yalong Bay is highly recommended if you visiting Sanya. Drive up the hill for a lovely view of the sea. There is a long stretch where all of the main resorts and 5 star hotels are located and there is also a shopping plaza located on this stretch. Went to the beach but it was quite crowded and the width of the sand was quite literally 10 feet, no more. There are water sports and activities available which are quite good and reasonably priced, though."
Great Bay,"This is a famous bay in Sanya, so there are many people here, but it is beautiful no matter in day or night time. You can relax yourself completely and enjoy the fun that the bay brings to you."
Worst place ever....,"I went there with a group of tourists, we arrived with the bus and we could only play in a small DIRTY ""beach"" so crowded that we decided to leave before the other people. If you don't stay in one of the expensive resorts on the beach than i advice you to don't go there"
Yalong Bay - a very nice beach,"Just to see another bay on Hainan we went down to this beach. It's a very beloved beach, because there were many people on this beach. I loved it."
Beautiful place,"Yalong bay is said to be among the 25 most beautiful beaches in Asia. Indeed it's a beautiful place with white sand beach, calm and transparent waters and breath taking mountain views!"
"lots of luxury hotels along the bay, beach is good, water is clean","lots of luxury hotels along the bay, beach is good, water is clean. there is a yalong bay shopping center here, lots of restaurant, very convenient to live here"
The fun beach,Dadonghai is the relax beach. Yalong Bay is the fun beach. Not as long as others and always crowded.  But it's fun. Known for its water activities.  Water sports and boat trips can be done. Scuba diving etc. I went on a boat excursion and underwater boat trip.  Easily accessible by bus. Many nice hotels to look at. Food options are minimal.  Toilets are minimal.  And sun loungers are minimal.Water is very clear and beautiful.  I went here many times
Great beach area but far from town,very upmarket area with many well known branded hotels. Great beach area but full of tourists and travel groups thus very commercialized . But definitely a good swim. Not many places to visit nearby and the SANYA city is a little far from here
"Nice area, yet overpriced and crowded","Well yalong is a nice area with beautiful beaches and views. But everything is full of people, dust and hotels. A bit too comercial for my taste. And everything you find in Sanya is more expensive here."
One of China’s small little secrets,"Love Yalong bay because you can be anywhere in the world. Beach is clean, warm water and lots of relaxing. No overcrowding like you might find on other beaches in China"
"Clean beach , clear water, good view","Yalong bay, a beach with the highest number of 5 stars hotel in the world. So good for swimming as the current is not strong. Water is very clear , but cold even in the afternoon. It will be good to get your inflatables and float lazily in the water without a care in the world.Don't worry, You can enjoy the beach for free even if you do not stay in any of the 5 stars hotel.You just don't get to use the hotel facilities and beach towels that's all. Bring your own !"
White sand and excellent secenery,"My family had a wonderful time on Yalong Bay. We stayed in Huayu Resorts thus it is very convenient for us to take the hotel shuttle to the beach. The beach is very beautiful - sand is white and the sea is crystal blue. We happened to travel during the down tourist period and there were not many people on the beach. There are other water activities on the sea - parachuting, skiing but you need to negotiate the price. We spent a long time making sand bath and making headway with the strong current waves that were sweeping onto the banks."
Really beautiful,"Went here while staying in Sanya, a great beach with lots of international branded hotels.  There are various water activities and the visibility is much better than Sanaya Bay."
Nice and clean beach,Visit there many time and good to sunshine with friend there. It is the sea and beach which suiteable for swim and fun. The wave will not be too strong... good place you should go to try.
Beautiful Bay,"Beautiful sandy beach, plentiful amenities,Great body boarding waves! Stunning from sunrise to sunset."
Best beach in China,"Yalong Bay has the best beach in Sanya, much nicer than any of the other areas. The beach is lined with 5 star hotels and there is a small shopping center with mainly restaurants not far from the beach. besides beach and hotels there is not really much to do in Yalong Bay but anybody going to Sanya should go there."
Uninteresting,"The area was totally under construction, the access to the beach is very difficult, they're too many resort and hotel. Never again."
Not a Spectacular Beach,"Yalong Bay beach area.
Went Wednesday April 6th and it was 30C but mostly overcast. We took bus 15 from Sanya River and it was about 35 minutes. You can get to the main public beach two different ways. There is a walkway near the bus stop that is lined with all kinds of vendors mostly selling jewelry. It goes to an underwater glass bottom boat ride area but just walk to the right of it and you are on the beach. There is a building where you can change and shower. There you can get a locker to keep your clothes for ¥30 or about $6. The beach is narrow and you can rent wooden lounge chairs that are in the shade. The sand is soft but where the waves wash ashore the sand is firm. The water was warm enough but this beach doesn't have a wow factor. A mediocre beach without restaurants. Seems to me that Chinese people don't buy a lot of snacks so there are very few places such as coffee, ice cream and donut shops. They do have Sea doo rentals at cheap prices about $20Can. The beach was crowded but just lacking in any excitement, I don't know what was missing?"
Top Beach in China,"Clean and flat beach, not crowded, great hotels. But food is very expensive in this area, more than 50% more than Shanghai"
lovely beach,"Stayed inside our holiday resort throughout and it was wonderful. Pleasant weather and enjoyed the sun, sand and the sea. A very affordable holiday for families as transportation, food and purchases are fairly cheap. Can give the famous local delicacies a miss, personally thought those were over rated. As such taste is subjective, try if you have not experienced better chicken rice, mutton etc."
Miles and miles of sand and sea,"One of the more pretigious beach area in Sanya. Open to public but the crowd is much better than being in Dadoing Bay area. Line of of hotels are mostly from international hotel chains. Lots of water activities for young and old alike. The Tourist Board should have more people policing the beach and fine locals who litter the beach with cigarette butts, plastic bottles, cans and plastic bags."
Nice beach,"Summary: 5km long nice beach, mostly soft, white, clean sand with good water quality combined with plenty of international and local 4-5 Star resorts. The easiest and most convenient way to have a beach holiday in China. Upsides: long, clean, not to busy at most parts. Perfect for long walks in early morning or later afternoon. Water quality mostly OK, few sea plants etc. Swimming possible. Life guards on watch. Downsides: lively 3 generation Dongbei Families next to you for full time real life ""how 6 adults raise one child"" dramas. During day at some sections smell of gasoline from boats and jetskiis. No independent beach restaurants or bars, hotel offerings expensive and ""medium"" tasty. Best areas of beach (clean and calm) are between Sheraton and Ritz Carlton, including Marriott and Hilton. Mangrove Tree and MGM focus on Mainland group tourism and entertainment."
Quiet beautiful beach,"Fine sand and wide beach, at least a mile long. Nice facilities, plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas. Gets a little windy after 4 pm."
Honey Moon,We enjoyed our trip here and had a wonderful time. We  visited many places while on the our trip away from the cold North.
Perfect beach ever),"It is the most beautiful and cleaner beach in Sanya. During the January, February there is crowded tourists from Mainland China"
Great place,Excellent scenery and great beaches . Street venders offer local foods and fresh coconuts . Beach activities can be found for about $20 - $30 . Sea side restaurants are great .
Oasis and turquoise beach....,"The best guaranteed location for all beach lovers, White sand and Crystal-clear ocean. One of many great located beach resorts in Hainan, China. The sea water is so clear that visibility can be reached nearly deep as 8 meters. This makes the place to be an excellent choice for scuba diving or snorkeling. Great atmosphere as each international hotel resort providing their own private beach area with beach chairs and umbrellas for resort guests only, however if you buy consumption of food or beverage you may after all use the facilities as well... It's perfect escaping place if you want Sun, light air breeze, crystal-clear water and oasis for all type guest, with family, couple or solo.Location: 35 kilometers from Sanya Phoenix International Airport, and not more than 25 kilometer from Sanya downtown City. Yalong Bay beach is about 7 kilometers long to walk from one side to the other side of the beach. If you want to stick around Yalong Bay and not heading to Sanya downtown, also have a cozy small little area village town with many restaurants, bars, cafeteria, live bands, shopping stores, supermarket and bank/ ATM as well but remember that Yalong Bay is quite expensive as most international hotels are located at this fantastic place. It's by far a luxury place but worth to visitTransportations: Airport from and to Yalong Bay cost roughly CNY100-130. Yalong Bay to Sanya downtown about CNY60-70, but check with hotel resort concierge if not book one day in advance to have them a round trip shuttle bus service for you as it won't cost as a checked in hotel guest. But remember that the taxi drivers can't speak English so if there are specific places you want to visit by yourself to have concierge team give their advice cards with numerous of places and locations which you can point to the driver to take you also have the hotel information and number on it when the time comes to return back. Local bus goes also which cost CNY6-8 from Yalong bay to city and return.International Resort Hotels: [St.Regis, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, MGM Grand, Hilton, Marriott, Pullman, Park Hyatt, Holiday Inn]Local 5 Star Resort Hotels: [Mangrove Tree, Huayu, Grand Metropark, Golden Palm, Tianhong, Cactus, horizon, Aegean Conifer]Golf Courses in and around Hainan : [Sun Valley Golf & Yalong Bay Golf]Parks:Yalong Bay Butterfly Valley & Yalong Bay Paradise Forest Park"
China beauty,Great area just to chill lots a stuff to se and do. Try the golf course or the new mall great food and shopping. A day at the beach is a must.
Beautiful beach,It was disappointing to be at this beautiful beach on an overcast day!  One of the prettiest areas by far!  Sand is white and clean!  Be sure to book one of the hotels on the beach to have access to a limited beach as far as public access goes!
"Place with close minded folk, dirty, not really beautiful with almost no cultural places.","I have been in Yalong and hainan several years: it is the most expensive place of China, people are very closed minded, they give western people double price in everything and dont speak any language, nature, can find better in all South Asia at lower prices with better people. Sanya has no beauty, dirty sea full of old ships, nothing in Hainan show culture, even the oriental one, even no one classic music hall or western sport. Better dont go to hainan if you want clean water and warm smart people."
Best beach is SE Asia probs,"Yalong Bay, something every Hainan tourist must sample. Roaring waves, beautiful sandy beach, immaculate. Everything you look for in a beach. Lacking in restaurants though."
Very sunny spot even in December,"Lots of water sports available such as jet-ski and para-sailing. Bring along your hat/cap and sunblock if you are visiting the beach. It was very sunny when we visited in december.If you are not a guest of the nearby hotel, the twin cushioned chairs with shade will cost 200 yuan to rent. There wasn't any free shady spot to sit down and relax.A row of eateries, including KFC, are available about 300m from the public beach entrance."
Beutiful Scenery and Beach,"Yalong Bay has some pretty exclusive Hotels amongst its beautiful Bay, Ideal for Honeymoons, or any other activity, you really need to go there to appreciate its beautiful Beaches.."
Very beautiful bay,It has the most beautiful ocean and beach in Sanya. Water is clean and clear. Temperature is perfect for swimming. But the entertainments are way overpriced! Too bad...  No shells to pick. There are a lot of couples taking their professional wedding photo there during the day.
White Sand Beach,"Very beautiful beach. It is a white sand beach. There was a Direct access to the beach from My hotel. Being non peak season, The beach was less crowded. Worth to be there to see the Sun rise from the top of the mountain."
A great escape from mainland China.,Definitely spend your time here and forget about visiting the city unless you want to check-out the first market.  Miles of uninterrupted natural beach with clean water.
I don't fancy this place as beach is small,"Maybe we did not go to the best side of the beach, find that the beach is small and not too appealing."
Move Over Maui ... these beaches are fantastic!,"What a delightful place.  I had the opportunity over a week to take many walks on the beach ... Make sure to head toward the marina -- the tide pools are amazing (make sure you have your flip flops or water shoes on).  There is even a small blow hole close to the marina that you can stand over (if you can find it) and the water will blow up at you (without enough force at all to be dangerous).While you are over there, go up to the mind boggling St Regis hotel ... enjoy some food or a coffee in the majestic lobby, then head out back to ogle the yachts and the old fishing boats in the river and marina ... what a perfect example of the old and new Chinas side by side ...Another thing not to miss is watching the sunrise in the morning.  I saw more people on the beach to watch the sunrise than at any other time.  If you are lucky, you will see/hear some of the locals walking up the beach and chanting to the morning at the top of their lungs ... very cool."
"Nice beach, but not much too do","In Essence you need to be a hotel guest to enjoy it. Amenities are expensive, set ski for example is 300 RRMB for 10 minutes. This is too much"
Nice beach,"This is the best spot I found in Sanya, we spent 2 days sun bathing there and just do nothing, good for relaxation..."
"Great Beach, Shame about the Erosion.","This is a very pleasant beach surrounded by Five Star Hotels. Plenty of Aqua Activities..Jet Skis, Hobie Catamarans etc and great white sand with very warm climes. Sunbathe on the beach then take lunch in one of the adjoining hotels."
Beautiful bay,"The blue water, white sand, activities, lifeguards and a view to rival Hawaii! all you could want. I had a morning run and swim everyday."
A nice day trip,"We took the bus from our hotel to get to the beach area.  It was an hour bus ride from the Guest International hotel.  At the bay, we rented a bike from one of the hotel for a two hour ride around the area.  The place is littered with 5 stars hotel only.  I swam in the beach and the water is warm and clean.  We went on a Monday so it wasn't that crowded.  I would recommend this place."
Took some getting used to!,"The first day we arrived on Yalong Bay public beach, I was horrified.  The beach itself is very limited in length, it is fenced in and patrolled, so there is no such thing as a nice morning stroll along the shore.  It was crowded, noisy, and littered with beach toys like jet ski's, and banana boats etc. There are plenty of beach chairs, most of them owned by big hotels, and the 'public' are therefore not allowed to use them.  We did however, get waved over by a lifeguard, who scratched $20 in the sand with a stick, and after handing over the money, we were allowed to sit in our pick of chairs.There are several restaurants on the beach that sell drinks, fresh fruit, and ice cream, and vendors walking around with quick snacks like noodles, and corn.The water is fairly clean, but again, crowded with people and water toys.  The sand is golden, and clean for the amount of visitors.In the afternoons, most of the sun shy locals retreat to their hotels, so it becomes much less crowded, and noisy.  Our favorite time to go out was between noon and 4pm.This is not a relaxing, secluded beach, but it is entertaining to sit and people watch!"
Beautiful Beach!,We stayed at a hotel which had a private beach. Stunning views & surprisingly quiet over the national holiday period. The sand was soft & the water was warm and calm. Loved spending our days at Yalong bay beach!
Sanya south lovely tropical island,Beautiful beaches  great restraunts all  around be sure to visit! Don't visit late September it be very busy as Chinese take annual holiday then !
Beautiful place ,Definitely worth visiting or spend a day just chilling on the beach. A few nice restaurants around too and get fresh seafood!
Great beach,Great beach with lots of international branded hotels along the stretch of beach. There is also a small neighbourhood mall at the end with touristy restaurants and a small supermarket which costs a bomb.
Away from the city,"Yalong Bay is it's own small town area from the crowds of Sanya. There is a small mall here; and, some good restaurants. Beautiful beaches; and, again, no minimal crowds!"
Nice Beach but too crowded,"The beach itself is quite nice, but it is too crowded and we were not even in main season. The price for 2 beach chair and 1 big umbrella was 100 RMB for one day, which is ok. All in all it was not nearly as good as expected due to reviews and pictures on the internet."
not worth the visit,"if you are just visiting, this place is a waste of time. The beach and sea is divided into sections belonging to the hotels, with a small space for the public. If you want a beach chair/umbrella you can pay one of the hotels, and use their small space. The amount of space you get to swim in is really quite ridiculous and crowded."
Yalong > Sanya,"When in Hainan Yalong is always hands down a better experience than Sanya Bay. The resorts here a nicer and you'll find the public beaches the beaches are whiter and less crowded than those at Sanya. There's a distinct lack of places to eat though and in that respect Sanya has a little more to offer. What little it does offer is overpriced and extraordinarily bad. I'm speaking specifically about the restaurants surrounding the Hilton. If you don't mind eating at the resort/hotel then Yalong is a great place to be. Plenty of quiet to be found, comparatively speaking of course, this is still China after all."
KMs of Sand,"Go to the beach early morning, 8-9AM, no one around, you will be the only one in the entire bay. Best beach is at Villa 5 hotel."
"Dirty, crowded and not relaxing at all - never again","Generally we are China fans and after reading several positive reviews we decided to spend 7 days at the so called best Chinese beach ""Yalong Bay"".However, we were really disappointed by the Yalong Bay and the area. The beaches are small and dirty.We spent time at the Ritz Carlton and HolidayInn Resort beach - really bad. Swimming is not possible. Annoying salesmen. Walking along the beach is possible for around 300 meters only, then there are fences. Warships and submarines are parked in front of the hotels. Unfortunately, the Chinese guys are able to fake several of the positive reviews that are published on trip advisor and other webpages.We will never come to Sanya again. Next time we will go again to Vietnam, Thailand, or the Philippines."
very nice bay with nice sand beaches and hotel gardens,"Yalong Bay has some big hotels (Mariott, Ritz/Carlton, Sheraton, Hilton) who all have a beautiful maintained garden and private sand beaches. From the beach you can easily walk from one hotel to the other."
Want to go again and again,"Yalong bay is one the place where you can to go again and again and sad to when it's to leave. Many hotels are there, you can book a better price upon arrival. Just book one night first to secure your first night and then you can change after and negotiate around. I like the night BBQ on the beach but be careful of the freshness of the fish and there is a bit of cheating when the bill comes..... The sea is very quite and clean. Restaurant hotels are expensive and the food per kilo..... attention when they scale in front of you. I had a better meal in a small street next to and the clams were delicious and at a regular prices. They knows how to make more money on tourist in the big places...."
lovely beach but!,"like most chinese beaches this is spoilt by rip offs and restrictions. you wont get near it unless you stay at one of the 5 star hotels and even then its crowded. When I was there they herded all the chinese into a small roped of area for swimming....all with life jackets!  I ignored that and found a quiet spot to do a bit of snorkling but they sent ""life guards""..twice..to get me out. bizarre!"
"Beautiful beach,","Compared to, Sanya and Dadonghai bay , this beach is much beautiful  but is also a bit expensive compared to the other two. There are  various water activities. Renting a hut (umbrella and two beach chairs) cost about  CNY  100 for a whole day. Renting tubes and other stuff is bit expensive.There are limited food stalls and the price is also high so better bring your own food and drinks. The beach was crowded although it was off season."
Nice but pricey,"Great area, with a beautiful beach. But everything is more expensive in Yalong Bay, and you don't have a lot of options."
Clean beach,As soon I went there I regretted that I didn't booked my hotel in this area. Water looks cleaner than Sanya bay near the airport.
Nice Beach,"Yalong Bay is a 7.5 kilometres  beach located southeast of Sanya City, Hainan Province, China. It is also known as the Yalong Bay National Resort. The Sea is cleaner and nicer too.  And that's why Many internationally operated hotels have opened in Yalong Bay, including the Sheraton Sanya Resort, Marriott Hotel, Ritz-Carlton Sanya Resort and MGM Grand Resorts. Several domestically-operated hotels including Resort Horizon, Mangrove Tree Resort, and Cactus Resort are also operating in the area."
Nice Beach but...................,"Much of the area is under construction and cut off from the public. The public beach was quite crowed even thought it was a week day. The beach chair rental is nothing short of robbery.. they wanted to charge us 150 rmb ($24) per chair at 1:00pm in the afternoon. My Chinese traveling partner talked them down to 200rmb ($30) 2 chairs, still an outrageous price for 1/2 day. They wanted an additional 20rmb $3.25) to use the changing room. The water and sand quality were very good, much better then Sanya Bay but the beach was a bit shallow. I wouldn't go back, there are other beaches that are better."
Yalong Bay is under construction and public beach access difficult,"We visited Yalong bay as it is touted as one of the beaches to visit in China.  However, there is so much noisy building construction, roads are a mess, and access to the beach is blocked either by hotels or blue construction wall barriers that the overall impression is not that great.  In the area of beach we entered, there was a single broad walkway where beach goers entered which had the requisite shopping stalls and people hawking services.Once on the beach even off season it is crowded and vendors are trying to sell ski mobies, parasailing, cabanas, and picture taking.  You can't really walk the beach easily as there areas roped off every 100 feet or so that you have to go around.The one positive of going here is that there are an extensive selection of restaurants right across from the beach, as well as shopping for beach needs.  There are also some western restaurants such as KFC, Burger King, and Starbucks if you some picky eaters.I found the beaches in the Haitang area much better and less overbuilt."
"Beautiful, restfull area","The Yalong Bay area is very nice area and well maintained, Within the resorts but just as well outside the resorts. I believe there are not many if any beach resorts in Europe who have a similar level There is limited traffic and very limited noise."
Nice beach for China,"Not completely 'open' restricted entry, hotel beach was clean.  Away from hotel areas, it got a trashy, mostly washed up trash. A shame.  Would not take much to clean it up."
Too many people,"Nice view, but too crowded. It very much depends on which hotel you stay with. Private hotel beach is better."
Pricy but worth it.,"The best beach in sanya. It come come up a little bit pricy cause only 5* hotels are in this part of Sanya, but I reaally liked the beach there. Minus is not so many places to eat on taking bay and everything it is more expensive than other beaches,but u can take a bus and go to town side for markets and cheaper restaraunts of u want."
Warm and relax sea,I think it's the best beach in Hainan. There isn't port or fishermen's boats close to the hotels. Quiet! Sometimes there are a big waves.
Great place for couple vacation,"it is a nice, clean beach. If you stay in one of those 5* hotels, normally they have their own private beach too."
Weekend,"Choose MGM, Sheraton, Marriot or Hilton for European or western people standards. Lovely place for family, sunshine and sea, for more you have to move downtown."
"quite, nice and clean","Bay for quite vacation, for family stay. Clean sea and sand beach. Near hotels there is street with restaurants with different prices."
Best beach in Sanya,"best place for scuba diving in Sanya .....a lot of water sports ....jet ski ,parasailing,banana boat so many are there ..... Clear water ,turquoise blue sea ....swimming in yalong bay is awesome......the waves r quite big ...there is no life guard....but no need to worry .....so many people r there ..... The water sports guyz will save you if anything happen ..... There are boundaries .....when you go there u will see so many people asking you for diving or jet ski .....don't talk to them if ur chinese is not good .....go to the water sports club ....get all the information .....the sunlight is too strong here ....always carry sunglasses,sunscreen.....you can hire the hut for 200 RMB .....not too much ...visit this website for more info about water sportshttp://www.sanyaweb.com/activities_water_sports_diving_sanya.htmlFood is too expensive & doesn't worth d money ....bring ur own food...lockers are available in the water sports club .....so keep ur stuffs there & enjoy the sunbath,swimming & water sports  ."
Good place to relax.,"Many times rested on this beach with my wife and daughter. Of course, a few years ago, it was better and more recently this beach has become very popular. There are many new hotels and the sea has become a bit dirty. But nevertheless it a good place to relax."
Yalong bay visit,"Good hardware, staff trying their best but have no idea abt customer service. Dont expect they will treat you like a reward member from creating customer experience. Bad value for food served if you enjoy wine and food"
"Nice beach, too many jet ski","The beach is really nice and at the time when we were there not many people. However, you have to be aware that there are a lot of jet skis making quite a lot of noise and smell and in the distance there is a military base.We enjoyed walking from the hotel to the small shopping area where you can find a Starbucks to get a good coffee and the standard Starbucks dishes."
N0 beach front,Over developement means that there is no beach front remaining. All of the hotels have taken the beaches so if you want to go to the beach you have to pay the hotel prices to enter. We drove the entire length of Yalong bay and couldn't see the beach once because of the beach front hotels.
Nice area to relax,"At present not quite finished, but soon to become  t h e  touristic holiday resort of Southern China because of the beaches, vegetation and sightseeing options."
I was disappointed: just overcrowded!,"We visited Jalong Bay only for a day trip and I was really disappointed. Noisy, crowded. The privat beaches areas of the hotels  were limited with fence..otherwise no privacy. Ok, the sand is fine and light...but that was all what impressed me. I am sorry, I was expecting more...."
BLUE BLUE,NICE beaches and FRESH air . GREAT SEA FOOD RESTAURANNTS are scattered around this area and the serve the freshest sea food U have ever tasted . A TOTAL REALXING STAY .
Small crowd on New Year Day 2015,"It was a pleasant surprise to find the beach uncrowded the two days we were there, especially given it was a long New Year Day weekend.  This worked well for us as we did not have to jostle to move around."
Nice,Beach is bluer than Sanya Bay. But the Scuba diving staff was not very helpful to cool your nerves. They just take you in without any instructions. And it is extremely crowded
Nice holidays,You can relax totally here by strolling along the beaches and breathing the fresh air. Tasting the local dishes is a must on your stay.A variety of seafood and delicious tropical fruits.Sea is very clean.
Night seafood market and restaurant,Amazing taste of seafood!!Must come before 6 pm and stay at the floating restaurant to enjoy so many variety of their tasty culinary!
"A quite, clean and beautiful beach.",Sand is fine.  Sea water is clear.  There are not so many people as in Sanya people.  An excellent place for relaxation.
Paradise!,"This is one of the best place for vacation. Execelt sea, nice coral sand, .... Fresh (straight from the tree) yellow mango in April is fantastic. I will never forget this paradise ......................"
Amazing place,One of the best places in the world. Warm sea and wonderful Coral Beach. Fresh mango and coconut directly from the tree. Paradise ...
Such A Beautiful Beach,"I have been there last few month back, it is so beautiful and i am quite content, but just the beach a little not clean then last time, maybe it is too famous and lots of people been there."
Beautiful view!,"Love the beautiful view, but, the wind can be so strong just like when we were there. So we didn't really play at the beach, just admire the view."
One Best Place to Relax yourself,"There are so many world-class hotels there,like MGM,Sheraton,Hilton,Ritz-Carlton and so on,different hotel has different facility and give you different enjoyment,long beach,spa,private swimming pool,clean air,azure sky,blue ocean,best food and the most important is the weather here is always so cool,normal temperature is about 25 degree even in winter, this is one of the best place iin the world to relax yourself"
The best beach in Sanya,"White sand, the sea is very clean and blue in the morning. The place is full of good resorts with many private beach."
Hainan´s Pearl,"We spent our vacation already twice in Yalong Bay and we loved it! It is the most beautiful bay in Hainan, with amazing, white-sand beach, great hotels and clean sea."
Very clean water,Very clean water.  But you will enjoy it only if you are staying in one of the resort that has their clean private beaches.
Everything here felt unnatural,"Beach looked pretty from a distance.  As soon I step on the sand, there are broken glasses, rocks that look like construction waste that was dumped here to fill up the beach...  Also, in water, everything just don't look right...  Water are dirty....  It just felt this place was built to look like a beach to impress... I am not sure if anything is real around here..."
beautiful beach,very well protected and maintained . Advise: Dont go on chinese public holidays. Mostly big luxury hotels in the area.
Less crowded than other beaches,It is more serene and less crowded thant Dadong bay and Sanya Bay; It is very  windy and offers a good view of South China Sea.
Yalong Bay,Sea view with clear water feature with seafood Restaurant and good food. Safe guard around for the safety. It miles away from city access that most dislikes.
WOW!,Great beach and views and the staff is friendly and helpful. They make your stay very enjoyable. You will love everything about the resort
a very good beach experience,"During the stay, we went to the beach every day. the best time to go there is in the morning or after 5 pm. if there is wave, it is much better. We like the wave and the sand."
Long white sandy public beach,"Pros:-Long beach. -Clean beach. -Various water sports available such as water skiing, banana boat, jet ski. Cons:-Difficult to find an exit route - I exited through a randomly selected resort & spa."
Nice place but mostly emotional Universal Theatre,"At Universal Theatre are always greatest shows with effects. Ive visited before so many place but firstly I saw such wonderful show with moving walls, pools and light effects. Bright costumes, nice music. I loved all just you can make photo there: NO CAMERA NO VIDEO NO PHONES :("
It's Okay...,"I don't hate this place, but I don't really love it, either. It's true that the water here is cleaner and clearer than any other place in Sanya - absolutely. It is a really beautiful bay, and I'm glad I saw it!But that comes at a price. The beach here is smaller and has just as many people as Dadonghai, so it feels more crowded. They've cut up the beach into little sections that you can swim in, sections for the jetskis, boats, and sections that are only allowed to be used by people staying in certain hotels. When I say cut up, I mean it - there are distinct and clear boundaries (that are enforced) for where you can and can't go. The places that are carved out for public use are super crowded, and although my girlfriend had a good time, I didn't really enjoy it. I couldn't swim more than 5 feet or so before I hit someone. I went on a Tuesday afternoon, so God knows what it's like on the weekend.....there's not really anywhere else to go around the beach. You're either on the beach, or you're up above the beach on the road or in the crowded restaurant/locker area. It would be nice if they added a place for people to walk around up above the water in the shade. There are lockers for storage, food and drinks to buy, umbrellas to rent, and they have a lot of activities you can take part in, but they are all two or three times the price of the other beaches I've been to in Sanya, and it's super expensive if you live in China and work on a Chinese salary like me. I  have been going to Dadonghai regularly since my trip there - it's a better value for your money, and there's more freedom to swim."
It's OK,Mostly restaurants with a few good retail outlets. Give it a few years or so and it will be up there with good shopping according to local plans.
Great Seafood Platter,Had an awesome seafood platter at the st regis for lunch and then a blast jet skiing for over an hour.
This is the best beach almost in china,"Yalong Bay beach is very famous in china. It's almost the best beach in china. But, i had been many beach around world, California, South island of New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia...  lots of place more beautiful than Yalong Bay. If you want stay here for 2~3 days short vacation, it will be good."
Beautiful bay,"We visited in June and we were very surprised how empty the beach was. It was very refreshing experience. Sand was white and water very clean. The hotel offered some water sports like jet ski, banana boat etc. The prices were bit high but that is to be expected. We enjoyed our stay there. However, the restaurants at La Floret shopping mall nearby didnt offer very big variety of food ( most of them had same menu!) and their food wasnt good. Moreover, it was overpriced.   We ended up eating at Pizza Hut which offered reasonable prices for a bit tastier ""western"" food. Overall experience was good if you are not expecting Bali/Thailand style holiday and if you accept that the locals will try to get as much money from you as they can... They still need to learn more about hospitality services but this is problem everywhere in China."
A relaxing beach holiday in China?! I didn´t think they existed!,"When I think of China I think of a massive population, ancient culture and great food, amongst other things. However I would have never considered China as a place to go for a relaxing beach holiday. I am currently living in China with my pregnant wife so overseas travel is out of the question. Therefore after my wife mentioned this island, just 1 hour flight from the busy city of Guangzhou, I was very intrigued. The airport is tiny and basic, but I found it really efficient and to be honest easier to navigate and pass through then many of the more famous airports. We decided to take the 27 bus from the airport to Yalong Bay - this is easy even if you don´t speak Chinese. I always recommend a few things in China:1) Tissues for the restaurants, toilets2) bottle of liquid soap - never any about3) phrasebook along with the basic excuse me, thanks, please and sorry4) print out of your hotel address in ChineseThe bus cost 11 RMB compared to 100 RMB for the taxi (after bartering). This is a pleasant ride showing you sanya bay, the city of sanya and passing by the national park and Yalong train station before getting to the bay. If you want an ample selection of restaurants, activities and nightlife then Yalong Bay is not ideal. The restauarants are limited and very overpriced. Here the hotels are more expensive and the restauarants cash in on this. A lot of restaurants offer a service to pick you up from your hotel. Be aware that if you take this you are obliged to eat at the restaurant even if you dont like the look of the menu or it is overpriced. As I said i felt that after a few days the selection of food was limited. I think this area is still developing and needs to establish more of a selection for tourists and review the pricing. Average meal was minimum 200 RMB which in China should give you a exquisite feast, however I wasnt blown away by any of the meals to be honest.However part of the reason you go to Yalong bay is the location, clean air and tranquility - things you crave after a while of living in China!The beach is seperated into private beaches owned by the hotels and it can get very busy, however the water is reasonably clear. This being said we spent more time at the swimming pool of our hotel (Cactus Resort). This had a great pool which to be honest was what made our holiday. It was open until 11 and we could have a nice relaxing night swim which was fantastic.We spent 5 days there which with the current amenities was about perfect. This is no Fiji, Thailand or Bali, but it is a great place for a break. If however you think it will be a cheap alternative to the other popular tourist destinations think again! I think Sanya bay might be cheaper, but Yalong Bay is reasonably overpriced for what it offers.To put things in context - the average wage in Sanya is 1500 RMB roughly, so with a meal costing 200 RMB minimum you wonder how and where the locals go, and why they try to rip of the tourist so blatently"
beautiful beach,"Excellent beach, soft sand though sometimes gets very hot so bring flip flops to get to the sea ! Sometimes a few jellyfish at certain times of the year. Sea temperature has to be experienced to be believed. Average temp around 27 degrees. Very nice."
Great visit,"Waves were ok-big, it was fun to swim there and ""wave-hop"" the water is pretty clear, the sand white and fine. Lots of water activities. I went jet-skiing, and it was amazing. I would recommend the water activities"
Beautiful beach but.......,"Beautiful beach but is not well maintained by the authority.  Waved are big and beautiful.Too crowded if you fo to the open beach, unless u spend abit more to stay at an hotel with private beach."
Beautiful beach,"Everything about this place is beautiful, not crowded at all. Only thing, do not buy anything from the stalls on the beach, about 5 minutes walk and there is a square with plenty if restaurants and a supermarket! Try some beach activities, definitely worth it!Oh one more thing, at 7pm everyone has to get out of the water,and you can only swim in designated areas, but I was not bothered."
Top Beach,"The finest beach are in Sanya and probably all of China. You won't find cleaner water anywhere, and certainly not in DaDongHai or Sanya Wan."
Nice and beautiful scenery,I like the beautiful beach where you have stalls serving drinks and food. The sea is blue and beautiful.
Narrow and crowded!,"Don't go there, unless you want to study chinese people going to the beach. You have to walk for ages to find your privat spot, which seems impossible with children. The beach is narrow, but the water quality is good enough. Take a taxi to Dadonghai bay, better and more peacefull (and more russians).Scandinavians with small children"
clean beach,I think it is well-protected white beach in Hainan island..
Kickass waves,"Great for surfers. We had fun being tossed around by 1-2 meter high waves, though it was a cool and cloudy day. Awesome experience. BUT, non-swimmers take care cos these waves can pack a punch."
Over crowded but great place to soak in the flavour,"Loads of activities available along the Yalong Bay area – jet Skiing, Paragliding, water cycles, and designated swimming areas and off course an entire range of local road side delicacies on offer.It was extremely busy when we were visiting the area, since it was Chinese New Year time. Worth a visit, but personally I preferred other quieter beaches around Sanya."
Best Beach,Great time - best beach in Hainan. We stayed in the Cactus Resort and had a great time. But do not expect more than beach. This place is just for relaxation but a great place to be for it.Go in low season to spare you from tons of tourists :)
Still best beach in Sanya,"This is best beach in Sanya. It is much cleaner than the beaches closer to Sanya city centre (e.g. Sanya bay). It is good for swimming and it does also fit younger children. Currents are usually not strong. Waves are usually rather small. Most hotels do cordon off the swimming area, so swimming in sea is pretty safe. Sand quality is pretty good. Beach is also over 7 kilometers long. Fits for jogging as we'll. Hotels offer their own water sports activities. This review focuses in beach itself. Yalong Bay Area has plenty of good hotels and it does also offer some decent restaurants (still the best destination in Sanya for your overall stay)."
excellent site,"Very nice beach. Area is lovely. Surrounding hills pittoresque. Lots of resorts to choose, but food is of ordinary quality and very expensive."
Number 1 Over Rated Resort!!!,Let me say straight away I had a most enjoyable holiday on Hainan Island however to say that Yalong Bay is China's number I beach destination does not say a lot a lot for the rest of the country's coastline.I felt totally let down by my visit.The place is nothing but a strip of (fine) sand boarded by a string of characterless modern hotels.The infrastructure is diabolical.The Shell Museum was an empty hulk looking ready for demolition and the building of yet another 20 storey hotel complex.The Butterfly Valley was boarded up and looked as though the last butterfly had packed it's bags years ago.The staff at the main booking area for the sea excursions were (untypically) unfriendly and spoke no English (not that I expect it always but this was the main tourist site in the bay)!When I eventually managed to inform them that I was interested in an advertised boat trip to view the coral beds they just shook their heads and said no!!The catering district was totally devoid of any atmosphere (very untypical for China).The holiday souvenir photographer on the beach seemed to be pestering young mainland females ... perhaps he wasn't Chinese as again this is very untypical.The shore line was not well kept.There were very few public WC'S .... what may you ask was good ... only the excellent and frequent bus service out of the place!Hainan Island tourist authorities if you are reading this you need to get your act together.Where has all the money gone from the building of all these big multinational hotels??Sorry but I can only award one star and that is for the bus service out.I really rate Trip Advisor but for once you have got your ratings completely wrong there are far better destinations on the Island!!
Best Beach In China,"Simply where you can find the best beach, best hotels and best restaurants in Sanya.   Here is the landmark which you cannot miss.  Also close to the Tropical Forest Park where you can have the best panoramic view of Yalong Bay on the mountain top."
Over rated beach,"After all the hype about Yalong Bay, I was disappointed in what I saw. Having said that, this is probably the best beach in China, with water that's clean enough to swim in. I've been here several times and if one chooses the right time, it's possible to avoid hoards of people. Usually Chinese avoid strong sun like the plague, so if one goes there mid week between 10:00 and 16:00 it's odds on that there would hardly be any of the annoying locals, spitting and smoking on the beach.Food sold in the area is severely over priced, so I'd advise anyone going there to take food along. For those who are looking for solitude, turn right as you enter the beach and keep walking for about 45 min to 1 hr, depending on your walking speed. The further you walk, the quieter it gets and you may even be able to tan in the buff."
Nice Beach,Nice and clean with fishes swimming with. Better stay in a resort with their own private area in the beach. Beautiful blue sea.
Nice clean beaches,The beach was nice and clean although fairly busy even in off season. The shopping centre was nice and had a variety of places to eat and look around.The public bus took about 45 minutes to come so if you are in a hurry you might consider a taxi instead.
TUristic and yet nice,"Nice bay, though is hard to get in for free. Amazing for summer because it is low season so if you can make it to the bay youll be able to enjoy it all for yourselves. Feel free to use the beds from the hotels, they wont say anythyng ;)"
best area of Sanya,"Have Starbucks, pizzahut and ok resturants.. its the oldest hotell area and have less building activety and better shops and resturants"
"Pretty good, but bored","The best hotels of Sanya located here as Sheraton, Hilton and lots of others, because it is really quiet bay with the cleanest beach. There are some restaurants like Pizza Hut, Macdonalds, Chinese Restaurants etc.But our hotel (Golden Bay) in this harbor, were more like sanatorium... It's better for people 35+"
Clean sandy beach!,"It's clean sandy beach!There are only 5-star hotels on this beach, a lot of places to eat. In the morning it's always clean, after the midday it could have few garbage but not every day!No waves! Convinient for the families with children!"
Beautiful :),I read some bad reviews and didn't end up staying in the area and opted for dadonghai instead. So we took a day trip there. We took the number 15 bus to the beach and walked through the water activities centre or what ever it is (there were loads of lockers etc) n we turned right and walked quite far on down the beach till we had a large spot to ourselves. The views were awesome but there were jetskis everywhere and they were so close near the swimmers. Idiots! Be careful with your belongings! My partner and I were both in the sea I was closer to our stuff and a man walked towards our belongings and kept staring at us but my partner and I noticed what was going on and we both stood up and he walked away. Then walked to other people's belongings and still saw we were watching! When we got to the hostel later the reception guy told us two people had their phone stolen from yalong bay. Just be careful!
one of the rare beaches in china,"not exactly hawaii as advertised and can not compete with its neighbours - thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia or the Philippines, but when in china it is a a great near by choice (not that there are many other options."
True white sandy beach,Best beach in China.  no other choice in sanya.  all branded hotels here offer a variety of good food.  dont miss the sunrise. Rare serenity in China.
Yalong bay beach,"We were told this would be the most beautiful beach of whole China. We thought it was too crowded, lots of rubbish lying around on the beach and in the water and flooded by Russians. We liked the Pizzahut though :)"
"Entrance fee, not worth to visit","With entrance fee, it is Not worth to visit if you have seen other beautiful beaches around the world already."
Nice beach,"Very quiet in the morning and calm and clean sea , very close to hotel pools and all facilities.there was nothing to claim about."
Beautiful beach/ excellent ocean view from hotel,"The  resorts near the beach are excellent, the town is still quite dirty except the tourist area. If you speak Chinese, the price to eat seafood at a restaurant is better in town then those near the resorts."
"Ready to scuba dive in Yalong Bay, Sanya, China?","I reserved a dive with the scuba shop located at the Aegean Conifer Resort Yalong Bay in Sanya, the Chinese name is 亚龙湾爱琴海潜水度假村.  I found them on PADI's website, they are the only dive shop in Yalong Bay listed on PADI's site (although they are not the only shop to paste PADI all over the shop in Yalong Bay).  The driver who came to pick me up openly complained that I took too long to come down, but I was 10 minutes late so perhaps he was right.  When you arrive it looks like a legitimate dive shop, but I started thinking it was strange when they took me straight to the bored teenage girl sitting behind a glass wall to pay my 780 CNY (for two dives) straight away, cash only.  They were not willing (or capable?) to provide details on where they would take me diving.  Then it was time for outfitting.  The octopuses were old and tired.  i was told none of the depth gauges worked on any of them, but the air gauges worked fine because ""those are necessary"".  In any case it was justified since the equipment is ""free of charge"" so I should not expect to have everything work fine.  The rubber was cracking on the hoses, but that was normal too.  When I began flexing the rubber on my octopus this other teenage girl tried stopping me saying I would break it if I kept doing that.  All the while I was inspecting the equipment, the second teenage girl and some old guy straight off the farm in Hunan with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth are telling me to relax, the equipment is fine, it's all normal, as if I'm a scared little girl.  The air temperature was over 30 degrees and the water temperature was 27 degrees, but the only wetsuits they have available are ankle length, long sleeves, thick, fit for diving in the Arctic.  I began complaining to them about the poor state of the equipment, but I was reassured with the offer of a discount in case any of my equipment failed (I would pay only 700 CNY in this case).  To prove everything was OK, they put my octopus in a bucket of water to show that the regulators worked.  The primary regulator worked fine, but the secondary one did not work at all.  It made this gurgling vibrating sound when I tried to breathe through it, and the button on the back had no reaction.  The farmer with the cigarette took it apart and showed me that everything was fine, put it back together again, and it still didn't work.  This is when I left.  To their credit, they returned my money with no questions asked.The dive master (loose use of the term) called me an hour later and said that everything was OK, they had new equipment, and if I came back the following day they would let me use the new equipment.  I told him maybe next time.The day before, at another ""dive shop"" on Yalong Bay at the Ritz Carlton, my wife rented wind surf equipment.  They first offered her one with a hole in the sail.  After refusing it, she got one that looked fine.  In 10 minutes, the screw holding the mast to the board broke off, and off came the sail, clipping her foot. Yalong Bay is the ""elite"" beach in Sanya.  I can't imagine the situation at the other sites."
Lovely Beach,"The sea here is very clean and clear. Lots of water sports available.  Beware, if you are not staying in one of the hotels, you will have to pay for sun loungers.  They were @ 100CNY each. Watch out for jet skis coming close to the swim areas"
pretty beach,One of the most gorgeous beaches I have ever seen. We were at the east side of the beach and could not find any empty beach chairs to hire because most of them are owned by the hotels on the beach. Showers are OK n not very clean. we had lunch on the beach which was again average.
An ideal holiday place near China,"A bit expensive but so close to China for a weekend escape...The beaches are great, the sea is  clean and the many luxury hotels offer a large variety of activities and sports for holidaymakers and fine restaurants ranging from Thai ( at the Yalong Bay national resort was one of our favourites) to Italian ..."
Best beach in Sanya,"That is the best beach I have seen in China so far. The sand looks white and the sea looks clear. Comparing to other beaches in China or even in Sanya, this one is what a beach should look like and it has all best hotels around it. Many acitivities to do as well. Very good for short holidays (You may feel boring after 4,5 days), families with kids or honeymoon trip alike. Drinks and food are very expensive. Most hotels around provide free bottled water though."
you won't regret your trip!,"beautiful white beaches, clear water... if you go to a resort that has also a private beach, then also not crowded. Perfect place for a gate away!"
Very Nice Beach,"This is an excellent beach, kept very clean and at least while we were there, not very crowded.  Water is very clean and for the most part even in bad weather protected enough to have only slight to moderate surf conditions.  Some food & beverage along the beach, lots of places to jet-ski or take a boat ride if you want.  Not too many vendors to bother you, so overall a very good experience."
"Quite good, a bit crowded","It's a perfect place for swimming in the sea, but since a lots of hotels are built along the Yalong beach, one next to another, it makes this bay a bit crowded."
Beautiful beach and sea,"Nice beach, very clean, and environment is great.But not convenient for finding a restaurant, better take your meal with you."
Overrated,Total tourism Chinese style.  Nothing special. Pricey.  Not so bad if you keep to the right hand end of the beach.
Beautiful Beach nice hotels however very dirty,"When you come a place like this and you are paying top prices at top brand hotels you expect that you a paying for good standards and clean places including the beach and maybe that the beach is full of bottles of water,empty cans, empty cigarette packages, and food packages is not the hotels fault but you would imagine that they would have people cleaning the beach and have signs and thrash cans everywhere to set the example for the people that is littering however they do not do it and is a shame but some parts of this beautiful beach are very, very dirty due to contamination and the currents I guess everything goes to the same place but the hotels just do not care and for me that is unacceptable and even at the hotel beach where the lounge chairs are is dirtyBeautifull ocean clear blue water and nice yellow sand"
a pleasant beach,"Good sea views, but the quality of facilities depends on your hotel.  Lots of motorized sports for those that like them.  Swimming areas are not even 2m deep."
lots of hotels with a pretty beach,There are 30 hotels in a row.  We entered through the Ritz and had a lovely walk on the beach.  There is little space between each of the hotels.  The beach was very blue and clean.
Best beach,"This area has the best hotels on the best White Sand Beach, you have access on the beach to other hotels just for the beautiful views. I had a perfect stay in Hilton Resort & Spa."
nice beach with clear water but too crowded,"Its has a beautiful beach, but somehow it is crowded. Overall hotels in Yalong Bay is expensive but somehow it's worth the value to stay in one of the hotel. Sometimes, you can see a navy ship in front of the hotel. It's so cool as I manage to see one."
top hotel/resort  Tien hong,We stayed in a room with ocean views     Room was excellent Hotel had its own private beach just accross road   Hotel staff ensured it was only used by guests and we got a beach lounge each day    All staff were excellent      Breakfast was great  Staff brought breakfast to our room on a few days so we could have it on the balcony overlooking the ocean  Hotel is not large with about 75 rooms but it is lovely     I would happily stay in any of the rooms
More money?,So after shelling out cash for one visit after another we thought we'd check out the beach a Yalong Bay. Once we arrived we learned you have to pay 60rmb just to visit the beach. Definitely not worth it unless of course you're at a hotel that doesn't have a beach of it's own
Picturesque,"I visited Yalong Bay in the summer of 2008 and was amazed by how quiet and clean it was. We had the beach to ourselves on a hot day and soaked it in. No surf, but lovely white sand."
Nice beach,I ahve to say the beach is very nice as the sand feels really comfortable and relaxing. The water is not so good as its quite murky and unswimable due to the large waves.
Great beach,"This beach is huge, long and sandy but not powdery. There are beach activities which you need to pay. You can take long strolls and enjoy the gentle breeze, very relaxing!"
This is not a free beach and far away from town,"We took the bus from Dadonghia to check out Yanlong. The bus driver told us if we did no buy a water activity it was not worth going.  The area is full of huge destination style resorts and far from anything to do. If you want to go on the beach you need to pay 50 rmb to get thru a gate at the public park. There did not appear to be any free beach access, I guess you could sneak thru a resort. The road from Dadonghia is under construction so makes t he drive longer. Unless you plan to stay at a resort in Yalong it is not worth the time and money to go see, Dadonghia is very nice and plenty to do. We wasted a day on this excursion. I gave it 3 stars becuase it probably is a very nice beach, but secluded and limit access makes it a bad day trip."
good sand and sea,but crowded with people so basically everyone is confined to a small swimming area giving roomto the speed boat etc
Sightseeing,"Go 南山看观音, love the coconut candy, the best one is the old tradition hard coconut candy ,buy inside the airport waiting hall near boarding game which is 30%cheaper than town. Shop in town must be careful"
Beautiful beaches and water,I never imagined there would be a beautiful resort setting here in China!!  It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Shanghai.
A good beach,"With direct access from hotels it is clean and well maintained. The water is clean. There are restaurants and bars accessible in the facing hotels to offer visitors a choice of dining experiences. Service is frequently slow, so patience is required."
A great place to relax,"It's crowded with families and Russian tourists, but it's still the best beach in China. You can read and relax under an umbrella from one of the resorts or swim and jet ski all day. Seafood BBQ and a coconut drink help make this a nice way to escape."
Nice white sandy beach of China,"I didn't spend too much time here, because I was in Sanya for only 1 day. But coming from Indonesia where there're lots of beautiful tropical beaches (both developed and wild ones), I can say Yalong is beautiful but it is not worth a special trip to Hainan if you come all the way from a distant place. There are many other better ones in SE Asia."
Not equal to it's name,There are so many hotels along Yalong Bay therefore the beach is usually crowded even in low season. The view quality is largely lowered by the buildings and tourists and it's much worse than it looked like 10 years ago.
grand beach,"large sandy beach ith lfe guards, clean and warm waters.best part the pullman beach area.nice place for long walks"
"Much better than Sanya Bay, overall average",Pro: it's much nicer than Sanya Bay.Con: it's very unimpressive compared to other amazing beaches and islands around SE Asia such in Thailand and Malaysia. Why bother with it when are so many other options around the world?
Quite a busy beach,"There is about ten hotels located along the Bay with the usual jet ski rental and scuba diving. Ritz Carlton, Marriot, Sheraton, Hilton and MGM to name a few."
"The best beach in China, but not the best beach in the world","Yalong bay is quiet, relaxing and clean! Sanya city and other bays are very dirty and SMELLY! But honestly there is not much to do or to see. Hainan is not worth to visit... It is expensive and for the same price you can go to Thailand, Indonesia or Malaysia which are much more exciting! So if you are not stuck in China (visa or family issues), better go somewhere else..."
the best bay in sanya,home sweet home it will be probably our best bay in sanya.but quite far away from city
Average,Nice beach but nothing spectacular. White sands and clean water. The water is not crystal clear and blue unless you have great weather and blue sky which didn't happen a lot when I was there
said to be the best beach in China,"This is a amazing place for most north Chinese to spend their holidays, without going abroad.   It 's a bit far away from Sanya city and the hotel is a bit expensive, but if you want to have a good rest and enjoy the sunshine, it's fine. The bay lies in the southeast corner of Hainan island, so you can not see the sunrise and sunset.I had an off-season travel in there and spent most time on the quiet beach."
Not much to like,"Beautiful beaches, but absolutely nothing to do. Caters to Chinese and Russian tourists. Westerners beware. Credit seldom taken in restaurants."
Picturesque But Washroom Deficient,"Scenic. Picturesque - one has to imagine when the surf's really up and pounding the beach. When I visited, the surf was tame as the waves rolled ashore.Food stalls (including one selling Indian food) are available.The changing room for men and the changing room for women are stuffy, dirty and smelly. The toilets are much better. Clean but with steps leading to each cubicle. Not for the handicapped or wheelchair bound. One has to buy a $2Yuan coupon, bring it to the attendant at the uni-sex toilet entrance to gain admission.There are palm trees close enough to set up hammocks.Although breezy, the heat is always there."
not for swimming,"If you are looking for a swimming holliday,go to Thailand"
Luxury Hotel,"Like View & Fruits, dislike weather which is very hot and wet."
relaxing place,"Great beach but you have to pay for it! and you can't swim where you want, the life guard is there to watch you"
Very nice beach,"One of the nicest beaches that we have been too.  The beach was clean and not crowded.  The sand was soft with a few shells, but no rocks.  The water was warm with a few gentle waves.The beach area is ringed by 5-star hotels so there is very little else to do or buy.  Given the nature of the hotels, food and drinks are expensive."
Beach-lovers´ heaven,"in yalongbay you don´t see any hotels from the beach, it´s large, and probably not really crowded in the main season either. Fantastic beach, very white sand, palm trees, sea was very clean, very soothing after dadonghai! But behind the beach the whole place is totally sterile- just resorts, nothing in the way of little shops or bars or restaurants"
Far from downtown. Pretty Beach,"Pretty beach, but nothing much. Better if you want to stay away from the crowds from downtown. Taxi to/from there may be 60+ RMB during the day. At 3 in the morning they made me pay 180 RMB from the airport"
Beautiful beach,"Loved the white sand and clear blue waters.  Although out of the way, it was worth it given the ocean water.  There are a few tiny islands that you can go to by boat.Disliked the throngs of people that go there every weekend which makes it hard to find a good spot to spend the day.  We stayed at a beach front chain hotel so that wasn't a problem for us but for those that take the bus there and want to spend the day, it can be a problem."
Beach,Yalong Bay is the best for beach in HainanRitz Carlton is the best beach....
Pleasant getaway from the 'buzz' of Dadonghai,Went to the Horizon Resort and Spa as they had a BOGOF deal on the thelasotonic pool.
Thai Restaurant,"Yalong Bay Mangrove Tree Resort, try the Thai restaurant. Arrive their fro lunch (early) of for dinner (early)"
Good beach but too commercialized,"Better sand and less crowded than Sanya bay. Similar to Phuket in Thailand, however prices of games are higher compared to Phuket."
Overcrowded Beach,"One of the best beach to go around at Sanya, a long coastline but not too wide.Best thing to do is to hire a boat to go a one secluded sandy area at the end of the beach. the location is inaccessible by land, therefore it makes a good private beach. I paid around 500 yuan for 5 person, and decided to stay and sun bath there  for 5 hours."
What a view as one enters the bay,"I was not expecting what I saw upon entering Yalong Bay.  This is a bustling port, bustling city with fantastic architecture and more being built in all directions - city on the fast track.  The boat traffice could have entertained me for hours on end.  The variety of fishing boats - old, new, tiny, large; of container ships, cruise ships, and expensive pleasure boats was mind boggling.  I had been prepared for a small, sleepy city.  Not so!  And the bridge from the harbor island to the mainland, is beautifully designed!  As with architecture, this Chinese island is doing everything with pizaaazzz!"
Lots of sea sports and activities,"It looks like Waikiki Beach in Hawaii except that it is in a tropical island, beautiful though it is.  There are lots of sporting activities one can indulge in if sea sports if one's kind of thing.Too commercialized and crowded for one to enjoy the beach."
A beach worth the trip,"the water was relatively clean for a Chinese beach,but remember the buses finish at 6:30 after that it's a taxi for around 60rmb"
Nice sandy Beach,"I never have doubt about Yalong Bay beach. It is beautiful, and the sand is very nice. I'm not a big sea food fan, so I honestly don't enjoy Hainan food at all. Thailand is my first choice for traveling to the sea."
"Beautiful, busy, Chinese beach...","Beautiful sandy beach; great for digging and building; lined with tropical jungle.Jetskis and motor boats racing parallel to the shore only 50 m out who stop and shout at you if you swim out 25 m; aggressive hotel security insisting that you don't stop in ""their"" section, many areas are very crowded on warm sunny days."
Beautiful,"Check it out for a day, different style beach from Sanya Bay"
"White Sand Beach, Private","I like because it is a private beach, no vendor, unlike Sanya Bay which is famous with all vendor"
Expensive and Crowded,The beach was smaller than Dadonghai or Sanya's and more exclusive. Good for a bus trip out of town and a touch of high end Chinese tourism.
best beach in Sanya,"famous place in Sanya, we've been stay serveral hotels, hilton, marriott, too noise, for family we prefer stay at Mandarin."
Yalong Bay,Great place to just hang out on the beach and swim. Kayaking was ridiculously expensive (and I have done my share of kayak rentals) so just skipped it.
The worst beach I ever seen.,"Smokers, wannabes 'scuba diver' try dive, wannabes tourist with bikinis and thong. I never like kuta beach in Bali, because it was crowded. And this is worst than kuta beach in Bali.Small kid peeing around the area, disgusting toilets, 100 of wet try dive walking around and bang you, thousands of smokers around, and blond russian teenager with petite bikinis and thongs wandering around showing off. I find it, so not exclusive to what people says. And I feel blessed I don't book my hotel at yalong bay area."
