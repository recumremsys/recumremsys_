Something for everyone in Yokohama,"Now I’m not a big shopper, but wether your into malls or not it’s still a good place to visit if your in the area. The waterfront walk alongside the shopping malls is very pleasant especially on a warm day, plenty of places to sit and people watch, and boy will there be plenty of people to watch, it’s very popular for locals and tourists alike. Call in at the ‘Hard Rock’ if you fancy a beer and burger, visit the old 1930s sailing ship in the dock, have a spin on the ferris wheel of get an even better view from the Landmark Tower (tallest in Japan) if it’s a clear day you can easily see Mt Fuji. Then catch the Seabas (sea-bus) to points around the bay."
Splended day trip from Tokyo,The entire place is very clean and pleasant. The air is crisp and fresh. There was an Okinawan marathon on-going when I went in Nov 2019 but it did not give me any inconvenience. The view is beautiful and I felt so relax to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Highly recommended
Beautiful and Clean Shopping/ Business District,"Beautiful harbor area and very clean. Lots of nice shopping areas, malls, and many types restaurants for everyones' tastes. There are plenty of nice walking paths and all very clean with beautiful landscapes."
Seaside shopping,"This is a nice urban area, quite near the station. Plenty of buildings, an amusement park and a giant ferris wheel. Quite nice to walk around here. Breezy and cool."
Nice place with great view of the harbor,"Minato Mirai is a nice place to walk around. There is a good view of the harbor, especially at night with the lights accenting the view. There are a number of shopping places to explore and an amusement park to enjoy rides."
Favourite City,"My parent stayed here and every time i visit them, I'm amazed by the view here in Minato Mirai, this is a wonderful seaside urban area. It also has a great amusement park with a gigantic ferris wheel, I also proposed to my girl friend here in 2019 and succeed. Definitely my favourite spot in the world."
Shopping galore,"A 30 minute easy walk from our accommodation but you can catch public transport. Lots of shops! Lots of wonderful sights on the way. Perfect for shopping, museums and fun."
A nice day,"Easy day trip from Tokyo. Very good place to relax a bit After the crowd of Tokyo. Nice walk along the Sea. A cute afternoon like a local people could do, without tourists."
Queen Square Shinjuku,Good place to see a panorama view. We have eaten  and enjoy with my family. We hope to come back next time when we are going to Tokyo.
Yokohamas latest part,"Enjoy walking along the waterfront before you get to the next museum, shoping mall or amusement park. Specially in the evening this area is really impressive with all its lights and colors."
Nice,The view and the settings were fantastic. The waterfront was so futuristic. I enjoyed so much even thogh I could not spend much time in here. It is an absolute must to see in Yokohama.
Nice walk ,"We took a nice walk along the Ookagawa river, from Yamashita Park to Minato Mirai 21 . Tall sky scrapers set the background and there is a big amusement park with a huge ferris wheel. The red brick warehouse is a nice picture spot. As we walked further along the bank of the river, there were sakura trees in full bloom."
Mesmerizing night view,"It basically just another shopping mall, with a typical shop inside it. What make it differ is the night view of the building around it, the theme park, and the seasonal event that held annually."
Large underground shopping area,There are three connecting shopping malls plus the subway station at the very bottom. As well as entry to the  Royal Park hotel which I stayed on my last trip when attending the WorldCon in 2007
Minatomirai,"Minatomirai is a famous tourist spot.These are many tall building and the view from there is very beautiful.Minatomirai has an amusement park and its roller coaster and ferries wheel are very famous.The roller coaster and the ferries wheel provide a panoramic view of Minatomirai.There is a cup noodle museum next to the amusement park,where you can make own cup noodles.You can also enjoy world noodle dishes at the cup noodle museum, which are very  delicious.There is a red brick warehouse near the  cup noodle museum,where events are held depending on the season.In winter,Strawberry festa is opened and you can eat delicious sweets using strawberry.The red brick warehouse usually allows you   to shop inside and you can buy souvenia.A short walk from Minatomirai will take you to Chinatown,where you can have lunch."
Vibrant area to spend time,"We stayed in the Minato Mirai area for 3 days and never left it.  There was so much to do in this new area we were flat out walking, shopping, dining and sightseeing. Everything is new and spacious with great harborside walks and parks. It houses the best hotels and shopping malls and the best views of Yokohama can be had from the Landmark Tower Skygarden here."
Minatomirai by night is lovely,"After an evening dinner Minatomirai is a lovely place to stroll by. Everything is lighted so beautifully and yet you do not feel the congestion like in Tokyo. There is a certain feel of serenity and peace here. You can stroll around the bay, the bridge across to World Porter and all around the many shopping malls. Great place to be in the evening."
Go wander...,"A kaleidoscope of a great suburb, if u will, of Yokohama. Please venture both day and night to experience the splendor, diversity and history of this area."
Great walk along the water,"We always go back to Minato Mirai to spend at least a good half-day. We enjoy the walk in Yamashita park, rose garden, Osanbashi pier, and the Landmark Tower.You can take Yokohama Sea Bass that runs from Yokohama to Yamashita park to enjoy the view.Yokohama Cosmoworld (amusement park) is my daughter's absolut favorite, there is Cup Noodle Museum and different cafe with outisde terrace.If you are looking for shopping opportunities you can visit World Porters and Queen Mall (good restaurants there too).From Yamashita park it's also walking distance to the China town."
located along the water front,"Located along the waterfront, the buildings of the Minato Mirai Chuo district (""central district"") form the distinctive skyline of Yokohama. near the river and sea and metro station too.shopping centre is in front of the bridge."
Minato Mirai 21,"This is a wonderful seaside urban area that was redeveloped in the 1980's.  It was a former shipyard but now the space has been converted to an amazing area that has magnificent hotels, convention centre, 600 plus shops and restaurants.  It also has a great amusement park with a gigantic ferris wheel.  Great place with manicure walkways, expansive park area and in general a wonderful place for family outings."
Modern neighborhood ,"This is definitely a new and modern neighborhood with lots of office and residential buildings, as well as malls and shopping areas. We enjoyed a stroll on a weekday when most of the streets were empty. Definitely worth a visit."
Nice modern area,"I liked this neighbourhood. Nice malls - Queens Square and Landmark plaza, nice skyscrapers and it is located by the waterfront which is also nice"
"Many things here were once the first in the world... Tower, wheel, escalator.","Yokohama unlike Tokyo has a pronounced city center - Minato Mirai 21. ""Minato Mirai"" means ""harbor of the future"". So if you are already here, consider the future has already come. The futuristic area was created on the site of the former shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the railway station. The mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata put forward this idea back in 1965. The path is not close to the idea to implementation. Construction began only in 1983 and is still in progress. The main landmark of the area and Yokohama's whole is called... Landmark Tower. I'm catching on. Tautology. Once the first tall building in Japan was built in 1993. The Landmark Tower has been ranked number 2 since 2012. Tokyo towers don't count. These are structures, not buildings.The Landmark Tower has an observatory on its 69th floor called the Sky Garden. The climb to the once fastest Elevator in the world will take 45 seconds. That's what the guidebooks say. It took us 38 seconds. Upstairs there is a bar, a gift shop and the best views of Yokohama. Shopping center Landmark Plaza waits for you downstairs.Queen's Towers, the neighbours of Landmark Tower, have many floors also. Several showrooms of car companies are scattered around the area. Chief of them is Nissan. As you know, its headquarters are here in Yokohama. Other entertainment is nearby. This is Cosmo world Park with a giant Ferris wheel, which used to be the largest in the world. There is no entrance fee to the Park, some attractions cost 300-800 yen each. The most romantic attraction of Minato Mirai is right there. This is training ship Nippon Maru (translated as ""Japanese ship"") set out in dry dock in 1984 and converted into a Museum. Yokohama port Museum is nearby. Admission: 400 yen for either museum, 600 yen for both. If the Museum itch has not passed, you can visit an unusual Museum, which you will not find, for example, in Europe. Cup Noodles Museum is located here on the island 100 meters from the Ferris Wheel. Here you can prepare your own ramen, make your own design packaging for noodles, etc. Each time paying an extra fee in addition to the entrance ticket of 500 yen."
Definitely worth the visit,"A number of options are available here, from the Subway to a harbor tour, Red Brick area, Landmark Tower, Ferris Wheel, Amusement Park and umpteen eateries."
Nice place to walk around,We stayed in this area and enjoyed walking around and looking at the sights. Lots of shops and an amusement park.
nice modern mall in yokohama,has a good assortment of boutiques and shopswalk to this area a mustlots of tourists and locals here
Impressive area heading to the harbour,"While staying in Yokohama early one morning from our hotel I walked to the station near the river and then did the very enjoyable walk along the water to the main harbour area.Walked past a big sailing ship in a dry dock that I think may be used for training , it was impressive, the amusement park that looks like a lot of fun is there also.There are a few museums in the area, nice to walk along the waterfront that is very neat and tidy , it has been well done. The huge wheel is there to see with the time on it at the top , very handy. When you get to the harbour the views are great and there is a nice floating restaurant there called Pier 21.From there look back to the city and view some very impressive buildings.This is a modern area but also with old history, take note of two big water pumps that were brought from London England in the 1890s to pump water when the docks were being built , read the history there.This is an area where you can spend a lot of time discovering, don’t miss it."
Modern,"It is a part of modern Japan. It is good to see, but I prefer the historical parts, like Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kagoshima,... But it was interesting experience."
everything we do,"This area has every category shop ‘d tenants ,food,fashion,qute items,hotel n restaurant,sight seeing spot. only watching n talking with your partner is good."
This is the park area around the waterfront,"from the picture you can see that this is the center of the amusement area of Yokohama's waterfront.  The amusement park is there,  the schooner ship is there.  The viewing tower is there,  The Red Brick Warehouse is there.  It is a pleasant walk around the area.  There are 3 or 4 museums there as well.  We were there a few days before a cruise and found this area to be clean, large, not  crowded and had a bunch of things to do.  It is worth browsing around for a day."
Tourist attraction,An area where most tourists will go to in Yokohama.  Modern architecture surrounded by malls.  Pleasant walk around.
Lovely Area with many things for all ages,"Amusement park, shopping, museums, parks, and restaurants. All within walking distance. Lovely Christmas market with authentic German food during the Christmas holiday. My idea of city planning."
Sightseeing ,"Very nice area to spend time with family. Lots of super modern buildings.  Lots of shops and restaurants, very clean waterways."
Happening place,"Yoy should try to stay at this area if happen visit here, landmark tower, noodle muzuem, amusement park, shopping malls, you could probably find everything here and play out fir a day .Most amenities are within a walking distance so suggest you no need to buy any one day train pass if you just plan to hang around here (i fo did and found just a waste!!)."
Nice place with nice view,A convenient place to shop and unwind from a tiring day in yokohama. wide variety of shopping malls and great views along the dock.
NIce place in the center of Yokohama,"it's good to be there. Plenty of shops, restaurants, amusements. A good central place to explore the Yokohama city center."
Stylish waterfront development,"Large open spaces and plenty of water frontage, Minato Mirai is a welcome oasis in the hustle of large Japanese city. Brilliant for early morning walks of afternoon shooping."
Nice View,Such a nice view here. Fresh sea breeze with lot to do here. Great place for a walk and photo session
Lovely shopping destination in scenic surroundings ,Yokohama is the second biggest city in Japan and Minato Mirai lends credence to the city. The Minato Mirai train station is 2 stops from Yokohama station. The Landmark Plaza and Queen’s Square are the high end shopping malls located in the area. The Landmark Tower located in the Plaza was once the tallest structures in Japan and has an observatory.Nearby is a entertainment area with rides including a giant wheel. Further ahead are other standalone shopping mall called World Porters and Red Brick Warehouses.The harbour area is also very picturesque and I would recommend that you stay till evening and enjoy the lit buildings. The giant wheel which keeps changing its colours is quite a sight. The area also has large number of eating joints. There is also a ramen museum here.You will not get bored in this area.
Must must must go,"Im not kidding, so modern so well designed a lot of thing to do for the whole family. Both day are night are great. I was complety shocked on how pretty the place is"
"Minato Mirai, one of Yokohama's premiere locations","Minato Mirai is by many accounts one of the best places to visit in Yokohama. The area is conveniently located two train stops away from Yokohama station. Minato Mirai has several shopping centers within close proximity of each other, lots of cafes and shops, as well as a carnival style amusement park full of fun and exciting rides, plus a ferris wheel. The Yokohama Hard Rock Cafe is located in Minato Mirai. Minato Mirai also offers a beautiful view of the port and Yokohama Bay. There's places full of activities for families with children as well as romantic spots for couples. The historical Red Brick Warehouse of Yokohama is also in the area. The Red Brick Warehouse often has a lot of interesting events worth checking out. If you go to Yokohama without visiting Minato Mirai, then you are missing out."
Must go if you visit Yokohama,"Really nice place, with a lot of attraction and good view. Really fit for photographer, walking, or sightseeing. You can search for nearby attraction for more detail review."
Yokohama's prettiest face,"PS:Maybe I won't be very objective writing about this place.I've lived in Yokohama for six months, and Minato Mirai was my refuge after crazily busy weeks..When you go there, you won't need any guide or pamphlet, just look around and you'll find a whole world of options..Skyscrapers? CheckedHuge shopping malls? GotchaSpectacular views of bay sceneries? You name itAmusement park , restaurants, convenience stores, meuseums, hotels .. Everything beautiful is carefully picked and placed in this littke piece of heaven.. So if you're ever close to minato mirai, just jump into that train and you won't regret it!"
quite nice,"Quite a nice area to walk around in. Large nice gardens and walkways, huge lit up Ferris wheel and great all round atmosphere."
Very good/comfortable place for especially baby car and young parents.,"I really recommend [Mark is] which has 900 cars parking very good food court (very nice/enough vegetables soft taste(for children) not expensive (under1000yen) clean wide you can find seats easily.It open at 10 o'clock ,I recommend the food court at 10 o'clock.You can find wide big clean comfortable toilets with your baby/child."
Yokohama's pride,"The Minato Mirai 21 is Yokohama's busiest center surrounded by one of Japan's tallest building structures i.e. the Yokohama Landmark Tower and several beautiful attractions such as the Yamashita Park, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the beautiful and Unique Yamashita park, the Yokohama Museum of Art, the Cosmo World amusement park with the famous Ferrous wheel, Minato Mirai concert hall which is home to the local Philharmonic Orchestra and the very long and beautiful pedestrian walkway i.e. the Kishamichi Promenade.For me and my wife, the Kishamichi Promenade was the highlight as we could walk for almost an hour on this famous boardwalk overlooking the superb Yokohama cityscape including the magnificent landmark tower, the historical red brick area as well as the beautiful view of the waterside. We could also watch several boats and ships pass by at regular intervals."
Nice walk!,"Have a walk and go to Minato Mirai 21 to enjoy the amusements of Yokohama....malls, waterfront, and a nice view"
Must visit area hosting many major attractions ! Something for everyone !,"This popular bayfront district encompasses something for everyone.  In a bustling city of 60 million people this newer central area is an eclectic mix of business, shopping, entertainment, and waterfront parks and plazas which focuses on green spaces, and human interaction. This area attracts both locals and visitors. Enjoy a pleasant boardwalk stroll from Yamashita Park to Rinko Park and experience a necklace of gardens & parks with magnificent views, creative art, and people enjoying life without any vehicular traffic.   Home to many major attractions it highlights are Cosmo World amusement park, stand up paddle boarding on the river channels, Queen's Square, Landmark Tower, Marine & Walk,  Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier, Cupnoodle Museum, several historic ships, Art, Maritime, & Silk Museums, a wide variety of eateries and cafes, and much more !   A must visit area, which was the highlight of Tokyo for us."
Magnificent Minato Mirai,"The picturesque central business district of Yokohama. The Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, tourism, attracting visitors both locals and foreign tourists alike. There are several hotels, cafe, rrestaurants , shopping centres in the region.During the evening, the illuminations of the area are a treat to watch along the bay front areas of Yokohama. The china town is at a walking distance of 20 minutes from Minato Mirai. From Tokyo Station to reach Minato Mirai,  take a JR Yokosuka line or JR Tokaido line train and get off at Yokohama station. Walking distance of 20 minutes Or take the Minato Mirai subway line and get off at Minatomirai station MM03.The area has the tallest building of Yokohama, the landmark tower"
Great night view,"I actually live in Yokohama I am not tourist.But when I have visitors, I always bring them here if possible in the evening. Because it’s great spots to take pictures. If it is daytime, take sea bus and show the view from the boat it’s also nice."
March Visit to Yokohama,"Not only is Yokohama a beautiful city, the Minato Mirai 21 area is absolutely wonderful, and I never tire walking around the grassy areas and sea shore. There are so many beautiful walks and places of interest along with shops and eating places. My favourite area in all of Yokohama without a doubt! If you take one of the slower trains from the centre of Tokyo, there is even a station - Minato Mirai, only about 40 minutes, or using the faster trains to Sakuragicho station and walk back towards Minato Mirai - only about ten minutes walk."
Very easy to walk around and seemed safe,"I like to get my exercise by walking around a city. This area was great - mostly flat and easy to navigate with places like Yamashita Park on the bay and the attractions near COSMO world amusement park (CupNoodles Museum, Red Brick Warehouse souvenir shops)."
We loved Minato Mirai 21.,"We had an awesome time In Minato Mirai 21. There is lots to do in the area. The red brick shopping area was really cool. We loved the Landmark building also and had lunch at Hard Rock Café.  There are many things to keep the whole family happy here. There was an outdoor concert on the day we went.  There are little buses that take you around the area too, to save walking too much.  I highly recommend that you visit the area."
Fall in Love Everytime,"Such a beautiful place with many surprising sites for weddings, anniversaries, and trips with your kids."
Lots of shopping,Many malls around the area.  Easy to spend hours just wandering around.  Close to the ferris wheel and the bay
Nice Place,"Nice place near Yokohama, excellent views, scenic - blend of modern architecture and legacy. Definitely a place to be on tourist list."
Great for families,This area is mainly taken up by carnival rides etc aimed at children. Adjacent to this is the Red Brick Warehouse that provides a market stall atmosphere for shoppers
"Lovely place for a stroll, with nice panorama to enjoy","Walkways are nice and clean, and allows one to appreciate the water views and the cityscape of Yokohama. It's also free!Aka-renga has cafes and restaurants; there are seasonal events on the open space across it too.Recommendable!"
Popular bayfront area,"Minato Mirai area is a good 1 day visit, with many shopping malls and attractions such as Cup Noodle Museum, Cosmo World, Red Brick Warehouse, World Porters, Landmark Tower etc. Suggest to drop by in the evening, with the entire area beautifully lit up, especially the ferris wheels."
Seaside view with a Ferris wheel ,"It is a nice seaside walk with a Ferris wheel in the background. If you like sea view or sound of the sea breeze, you are in the right place. It is a vast area where you can have a good stroll to enjoy the calm and sometime hostility of the sea wave. Not really a must visit when you are in Yokohama."
Great to walk around ,Splendid views and busy with local people at the weekend So enjoyed walking aroundYou can pick up a boat for trip or just sit and people watch
beautiful area especially for the night lights,"The Minato Mirai area is beautiful, especially at night, and theres a few things worth doing in the area. It was pretty quiet when we went in April, especially compared to Tokyo where we had stayed before."
A popular place,"We got great views of this area from our Hotel room. Nice area for a stroll, shopping, dining, Ferris wheel and outdoor garden near the water front"
Good area to walk around,"The nearest station to it is SakuragichoOnce you arrive at station go outside,  and cross the street and walk over towards Porter mall,  the mall is nice,  There's an old ship,  and a nice parkThere is also the noodles museum to see.Once finished go back to Sakuragicho station to take your bus or train to the next destination,  hence at this station you have more options and more frequently. C U Around"
Beautiful,"It's a very beautiful place to visit in Yokohama for shopping, dining, or even just taking a nice leisurely stroll along the streets with interesting architecture and a beautiful seaside park. Not a bad way to spend a lazy afternoon with your family."
Amazing place!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Minato Mirai. Located along the waterfront, Minato Mirai is a very popular place that has a lot to offer! The high-rises, the Landmark Tower and Cosmo World Ferris Wheel are some of its major attractions!"
Minaro Mirai has so much to offer,From modern shopping to unusual dining in old wearhouses Minato Mirai is a full day attraction. I went to the Tower Mall and visited the old dry dock at the base. You can feel the history of Japan in its pre WWII days. Found the Yokohama Hard Rock Cafe In the mall and enjoyed  walking through the store. I enjoyed looking at the old ship docked right by the mall. I couldn’t see the entire area because there was so much to see and do.
Incredible area,"Visited the area on business. However, the area here is amazing, from Landmark Tower,  Nippon Maru ship and museum, the vast shopping arcades, Cosmo World amusements. So many different things to see and do. Approx a 15 min walk from Yokohama station."
Best harbour view spot in Kanto region,"highly recommend, just go and enjoy. start your tour at Sakuragicho St. exit, stroll around until Akarenga, take a water bus if you want to get back. Eat out in one of the various international restaurants."
worth to visit at least for your instagram feed,if took train from yokohama station. stop at sakuragicho station of negishi line. its just across street. its a cool place to explore. you can go to landamark building or choose to visit a museum. you will find how western influence in japanese building architecture
Impressive area,"The Minato Mirai area is pretty impressive with a lot of interesting attractions including the Red Brick Warehouse, Landmark Towers, the Yokohama Museum of Art, Cup Noodle Museum as well as a couple of theme parks. You can definitely spent one or full two days here experiencing all the sights."
A Place where the Buildings are Stunning,"Minato houses huge and very modern structures like shopping malls, office buildings and stunning views. There even is a kitschy copy of the Statue of Liberty."
"Less crowded than Tokyo, still very impressive","Basically if you into urban exploratation, you can spend days here, there are so many shopping centers, shops, restaurants, bars, entertainment between the offices that one finds new things after a week. Do not miss the Landmark Tower (or you can glimpse the Fuji in good weather for free from the Sky Tower elevator lobby on all twenty-somethingth floors) and check out the restaurants!"
Bliss!!,"You can never get bored here...just hop on to the Ferris wheel if you want the best view of the bay and the city or take a walk by the bay with your friends or alone...colourful and lively atmosphere...best of the malls,noodles museum, cruise...the list of attractions is endless...very well connected with metro...a must visit place if you are in Yokohama"
"So much to do, so much to see!","Minato Mirai is a large modern complex with hotels, offices, restaurants, conference centre and lots of high quality shops in a compact setting. If you are lucky, you may see a local concert or theatre production in the entertainment area of the main shopping arcade. The shops are good - many brand names as well as local marques - and there are dozens of restaurants around the building, Indian, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Western, even a lively Hard Rock Cafe. The Landmark Tower at one end has a great view of the city from the top deck, very well-organised and arranged, with souvenir shop of course, and yet another restaurant. At the other end is the massive Pacifico conference centre, and open auditorium structure. Close by is the magnificent Yokohama Maritime Museum and the old NIppon Maru sailing ship, which you can tour. Further afield is the Aka Rengakan (Red Brick Warehouse), more shops and Motion Blue jazz club, the Yokohama version of the famous Blue Note."
A bful destination for a romantic walk,"Had a chance to visit Minato Mirai on my own after a business meet in Yokohama , it’s a beautiful experience roaming under the landmark tower , by chance I went to the coastal line & cruise was about sail from there .. its was really a wonderful sight along with the ocean , and roaming with looking at the landmark tower & surroundings ."
Its more than Excellent,"As the Title says , Its more than Excellent . Very very attractive. Evening is the best time to visit. It looks colorful. you can enjoy rides there like Roller Coaster, Giant Wheel and experience a beautiful view as well . Its Awesome and Awesome and Awesome."
Worth for a Short Day Trip,"Nice view of the skyline at dusk even until night. Within walking distance from Minatomirai train station to several famous landmarks here such as Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris Wheel, Cosmo World Amusement Park, the Landmark Tower, Queen's Square, and Red Brick Warehouses. It's less than an hour trip by train from Tokyo station to Minatomirai Station. Definitely worth to visit for a short day trip."

Always one of our favorite car drive destinations,"One of the good things is to have a large parking lots attached to the building complex since we tend to drive rather than train and walk for our shopping. Of course, they are conveniently located for those who come by train. If I have a guest, love to take them to the sky garden on the Landmark Tower for a great view. In the building, they have a huge shopping mall where we can get most of our stuff from books, clothes, jewelry, toys and a variety of foods. Attached to the Landmark Tower, you can walk to Queen’s Square and the Mark is. Those combined shopping district is large enough to satisfy our needs."
Beautiful Waterfront,"Yokohama makes for a ideal day trip from Tokyo. It's only 30 minute by train from Shinjuku and will give you a welcomed change of pace compared to the frantic hustle and bustle of Metropolitan Tokyo. The Minato Mirai waterfront is just one stop away from Yokohama Station -- get off at Sakuragicho Station. Visit this beautiful waterfront around sunset time and get a magical feel! Towards the end of the Minato Mirai waterfront and nearer to Tokyo Bay is a mid-size mall with lots of eateries. Everything, including the train journey from Shinjuku and the train from Yokohama Station to Sakuragicho Station, is covered in the JR Rail Pass."
Sterile foreign tourist oriented enclave,"When Minatomirai was envisioned at the height of the Japanese bubble era, built on landfill, it was intended to be a futuristic redevelopment of Yokohama. The reality is slightly different. It has clean, westernized, modern shopping facilities, condo towers filled with the wealthy from a neighboring country (you know which one I am talking about) and massive, westernized hotels catering to foreign tourists. The whole place appears optimized at this point to keep the foreigners as far away from the locals as possible. Completely uninteresting, especially if you come from an industrialized nation."
LANDMARK,"A touristic area with shopping malls, restaurants, the landmark tower, the Minato Mirai hall which is a covered square where where several musical and cultural activities are held out, such as concerts and art exhibitions. But mainly it is a concert hall built for the finest shows.  Located at the Queen´s Square of Yokohama, a tourists perfect area to enjoy."
Great views,Fantastic way to see Yokohama. Wonderful experience. Shopping and restaurants wonderful. Fasted elevator in Asia.
Good to visit at least once,"Shopping malls’ everywhere. This area has to be combined with cosmo world, landmark tower, and red brick house if you don’t like malls."
Kind of land mark in Yokohama,"A famous tourist spot in Yokohama.  The landmark tower is symbolic with Nipponmaru (ship).  Theme park like spot may be attractive for shopping but nothing else much.  Avoid going to restaurants in this area as the price is bit more expensive, comparing to downtown Yokohama."
"Wonderful place to play, shop and enjoy","Had a great afternoon here. A very different vibe to Tokyo and other areas of Japan. Lots of great shops, restaurants  and very relaxing seaside area. Definitely worth a visit."
Lots to see and do here!,"Built on the old Mitsubishi shipyard (a couple of the yard's drydocks are preserved) and a railyard, this is now the central business district of Yokohama with a huge office building (the Landmark Tower), convention center (Pacifico Yokohama), museums, shopping centers, amusement park, hotels, restaurants, etc. It is a well laid (planned actually) complex that balances all of these disparate parts beautifully (from functional and aesthetic viewpoints). We have been here many times over the past 20 years and always have enjoyed the energy of the place, not the mention the views, etc. The Intercontinental is certainly the hotel of choice with its spectacular views of the harbor beyond, but the Pan Pacific is also very nice and is more closely connected to the shopping areas and the big office tower - we've stayed at both several times. If you can't find a restaurant (or two or three) to your liking, then you must be doing something wrong. When not eating and sleeping, there is always something to do - although we often enjoy simply walking around and looking at the activity in the harbor or watching the people enjoying themselves."
Quiet City,"But mesmerizing day and night! This place is where you can walk, eat, shop and sightseeing in peace. Lovely to see artists around just relaxing. They also have amusement park and malls. Don't forget to check out their popular 100-300 yen stores! Good finds."
"Lovely area, nice to walk around","A not too crowded area in Yokohama. Our hotel is in this area so not hard to visit. I’ve never seen so many food places, and shopping floors in my life in one location. Building after building with so many floors of restaurants and shops. Nice strolling near the water as well. Great spot."
Get your walking shoes on! ,Nice area for a stroll and photos. If you’re in Yokohama you’re unlikely to miss it as you will probably use it going from Landmark Tower / Nissin Cup Noodle Museum to Chinatown - not that this is around a 2km walk!
Great part of town,"Really lovely part of Yokohama, well worth a walk around. Shops and views and a great atmosphere to take in."
Enjoyable seaside stroll,"Beautiful view, especially at night, where it offers a breathtaking nightscape. Not too crowded either on regular days. Many great malls around the station. A good place to stroll around leisurely or sit and talk with your companions."
Worth a visit to Minato Mirai,"Areas of shopping centers, attractions to visit such as Cosmo World, Red Brick Warehouses, Pier, Cup noodles museum and a nearby Yamishita Park."

Pretty area,Area is filled with malls and dotted with parks. Lovely place to stroll at night and take in the pretty skyline.
the western face of Yokohama,"You may or may not like staying in Minato Mirai. There are lots of entertainment for families with young kids, shopping opportunities and food that is very westernized.On the whole, it is beautiful, the buildings are 21st century style and the area is safe and clean."
Post cruise,"This is the view of The Minato Mirai area from the New Otani Inn.  It’s a beautiful area to walk around.  Loads of things to do besides ride the Ferris wheel, cup noodle museum, maritime museum, and the World porter is a fun place to shop!  The Nipponmaru training ship is now docked there to see also.  This ship used to come to Hawaii all the time before."
In conjunction with Chinatown Visit in Yokohama ,Out for a nice walk around town. Numerous shops located in the area. It certainly provides a variety of upscale options.
Supermarket ,"This supermarket is walking distance from intercontinental Yokohama Grand into Queen square down level 1, to the subway line & followed the sign says MarkIs brought sushi, local produce & lunches great place. Upper floor are the shopping for clothing been Australian it’s very hard to fine things that fit or suite our style but it is worth shopping around if you are staying local:"
the best place that you can see in Yokohama,"Actually it is the new and luxury part of the Yokohama that include beautiful shopping malls and multiples towers with superb engineering technology. Among them, the land mark tower, Royal park hotel and Queens tower are more interesting. You can finds any kind of international restaurants and nearly all brand names on fashion."
Waste of time ,"This site was so appointmenting.  This is supposed to be one of the main sites to see when you're in Yokohama, I thought a one star  was giving it too much. Don't bother going"
Clean and modern area with loads to do and see.,"The Minato Mirai 21 area is a place you could spend hours strolling round. The buildings are impressive, especially the Landmark tower which I think is stunning and is as impressive if not more so than the skyscrapers of Tokyo. There is also the Nippon Maru ship docked there. Views from the top are amazing, though we never got to see Mt. Fuji due to clouds. There is also the Landmark plaza and Queens plaza shopping malls which are both shoppers paradises. The Cosmoworld ammusment park has a load of rides including the massive ferris wheel and and is free to enter, you just pay per ride. There are a fantastic variety of places to eat, especially in the World Porters."
Scenic view,"Perfect place for a leisurely stroll. It was a relaxing day, we got off Sakuragicho station to walk to Cup Noodles Museum."
Modern yet pleasant,"A super modern yet quite pleasant area in the bustling Yokohama. This area houses the amusement park (with the wonderful ferris wheel, as well as some exciting rides for the thrill seekers) and the landmark tower. It's a very pleasant walk from the omonbashi pier to here."
The pleasure never ends,"From the endless rides and attractions to the hyper-sophisticated toilets to the amazing range of eateries, shops down to the waterworks facing the amazing art museum (not to be missed even with young children), Minato Mirai is a treat for all ages. The best urban complex ever seen."
Modern city in Japan,"Minatomirai 21 located is one more stop from Yokohama station ..i took the express train from Shinjuku station around 1 hrs. to Yokohama. Minatomirai 21 have fun park, Cupnoodles museum and shopping mall ....so I recommend this city if someone love to sightseeing in the modern city.."
Nice place to visit,Took the train to Yokohama and then the city metro to Minato Mirai.  Lots of good shopping and take time to ride the Ferris Wheel.
Beautiful skyline,"You cannot miss this sight in early morning or in the evening. You can take a stroll across the bridge over the river or take the sliding pathway, either way Yokohama rises in front."
Very quiet yet amusing,"Minato Mirai is a great place for travelling couples. The neighborhood is very quiet yet somehow entertaining, if you just keep walking along the harbor."
Beautiful place ,Great place to take a walk at any time of the day. Very busy place. You can take a good walk along the Minato Mirai and feel refreshed.
Impressive!,"Impressive and lively place in Yokohama. Unfortunately, on canot go to the upper floors without paying."
Pokemon Break Out,Pokemon Break Out 9-15 Aug 2017! Many pokemon fans watching pokemon dancing and catching pokemon at Pokemon Go park beside Cup Noodle Museum.
Amazing Minato Mirai Area,"I visited my husband who is working in the Minato Mirai area. The area is very clean and modern and has lots to do in the day time. There is not much in the way of night life but this is not a concern for me. The malls have a fantastic selection of shops and the World Porters mall is definitely worth a visit. There is a huge selection of eateries of all types of food. If you want to venture further you can walk to China Town, the Baseball Stadium, or the lovely area of Motomachi. There are great tube links straight from in the mall to Tokyo , Yokohama, or the Motomachi area. Going to the top of Landmark Tower is a must! I do not like heights but the lift whisks you up the 69 floors in about 20 seconds and the view is amazing. There are toilets, a shop, a bar, and a cafe up the top. If you get a clear day you can see Mt Fuji. You can also make your own Cup Noodle at the Cup Noodle museum! The only issue I had was the language barrier but the locals make the effort to communicate."
Lunch ,Great place to go and get out of the heat. Has great restaurants and lots of coffee shops nice shops to have a look around.
Beautiful and Transformed,"Yokohama has done such a nice job with this area - Landmark Tower and Queens Square are so fun to walk around.  Go at night with the lights.  They have Bay Cycle, too where you can get bikes for free and ride around.  Very, very enjoyable walking around and catching dinner with a plethora of choices."
Very entertaining ,"Out hotel at minatomirai area. Comfort place and very entertaining. Near cosmo world, red brick, landmark tower. Trying to walking around at night, ohhhh my fav for healing place"
Once A Shipyard,"This area is the waterside area that houses the Landmark Tower, once Japan''s tallest until 2014. It has been developed as very pleasant area that contains a number of historical ships (Nippon Maru) and some pleasant places to stroll. It is just a short walk from Sakuragicho station."
Master-Planning at its Best,"Minato Mirai is a totally new neighborhood in downtown Yokohama.It has been master-planned, hence the great swathes of empty space, but these are being developed as need arises. But the footpaths are wide, the buildings are attractive and are a good balance of residential and commercial.Well done Daiwa!"
A city without the hustle-bustle,"Minato Mirai which literally translates to ""future harbor"" is a city without the hustle-bustle.  Yokohama was our day trip from Tokyo, and I didn't regret the long train ride and the long walk up from the station. Spectacular architecture, breathtaking skyline and scenic harbor views...oh, I love every bit of this place!  Must-visit.  Will definitely return."
"Lots to see, do, buy","Shops, amusement park, boutiques near the marina, restaurants all make for a good weekend outing.  Recommend."
Beautifully laid out theme park zone,This is a great place for all to enjoy. Rides available for the young and the young at heart. The cosmo clock ferris wheel is a definite must ride as you get a fantastic view of the Yokohama sea side. All attractions have a specific price but there are vending machines available that will give you a small discount if you buy in bulk. Stay around after the sun goes down as the place lights up for some fantastic picture taking.
Beautiful,"If travelling to Tokyo, Minato mirai is a must! even though it is in a different city it is only 30 min away from tokyo and it is 100x more beautiful. From here u can get to landmark tower or the ferris wheel where night or day it has one of the best views in Japan."
japan city but in french environment,I liked yokohama more than Tokyo and Osaka. It is so clean and organized and it has the French look and environment and it is just 20 mins train from Tokyo.
Modern business and tourist center,"It was a modern centre with high rise buildings.  Shops and restaurants were concentrated there.  Office buildings and large Departmental Stores could alsobe found.  The Fun Park with nicely illuminated Ferris Wheel were also highlights for the children, particularly at nights and during holiday periods."
Modern delight,Modern city layout with covered shopping and walkways.  Plenty of restaurants with tasteful decorations but surprisingly affordable.  Friendly service and English well understood.  Hotels all serviced by airport buses.  Adequate shopping and museums all walkable distance.  What more can one ask for?
Another city.,"I found it interesting to visit, but would not want to live there with so many high rise apartments and mall after mall, a shoppaholics delight with even whole stores devoted to Pokemon! The fun park would delight children and the Ferris wheel was worth a look to view the city surrounds."
"A modern, high class tourist centre",The Minato Mirai 21 building is a modern building with expensive shops and lots of dining locations. It has been developed for business customers.  The building architecture is attractive and worth to take pictures.  Many reputable shops have branches there.  Our tour took half a day with a relaxing stop in one of the coffee shops.
Best area to stay at in Yokohama!,I've been to the Tokyo/Yokohama area multiple times and by far Minato Mirai is the best area I stayed at.  Restaurants are abundant and I recommend staying at a hotel in the queen's square area where you have a direct access to the mall and the minatomirai train station.
Lit place,"Good place for shopping, very modern and stylish building. There's a halal indian restaurant inside."
Very pleasant harbor like area a mix of residential business and entertainment,The area has a mix of residential business and entertainment feel to it. Everything is kept clean and well maintained. Green areas are well distributed as well as restaurants shopping and attractions. In April you can enjoy the cherry blossoms that is a must see.You can find a good sushi at the 5th floor of the Landmark tower. (Not expensive)
Modern,"Minatomirai area is a new modern district of Yokohama, high end living, good shopping, and good dining. A clean bright area with sea front and recreation parks"
A beautiful area.,"This is a beautiful area to take a slow stroll in the evening.While the views during day time are rather limited, the scenery at night are absolutely stunning."
Modern City,"With all huge skyscrapers along, you can enjoy shopping in any mall. Unique design of the buildings will impress you."
Interesting shopping/eating area,"A great walking area for shopping and eating.  The old nicely restored red bricked buildings was part of the old customs house.  It is now full of fancy shops and nice restaurants.  In the courtyard between the two sets of buildings, they had a girls’ ramen festival.  Lots of ramen stands serving what seemed to be special ramens along with other side dishes and drinks.  They had a girls only seating area.  They have an Aeon Mall which has a Hawaii specialty section.  Across the Mall building they have an amusement area with a giant ferris wheel and other rollercoaster types of rides.  Unfortunately, we couldn’t see/do more since we had to rush over to catch the dinner bay cruise."
Fascinating Architecture,"Having grown up in the 1940's in Yokohama, I was fascinated by how beautiful this totally new part of the city has become."
A nice walk along the bay area,"This is a nicely designed  promenade in Yokohama with scenic views and leisure atmosphere.  If you stay in one of the hotels in the Minato Mirai, this place will be a must visit during your stay."
great mix of food and shopping and entertainment,everything you need in one place and easy to move around. good connectivity to most of Yokohama. great restraunts
Beautiful Bay Area of Yokohama...,"I recommend to visit MInato Mirai 21 area for taking a walk.You can walk from Yamashita park to MM21.Don't forget to stop at Yokohama Osanbashi Pier.The Osanbashi Yokohama International Passenger Terminal isa major port where foreign cruise ships dock during international cruises.Surrounded by the sea, it features Yokohama’s best viewsof the Minato Mirai skyline, and the pier is one of the most creativearchitectural achievements you are ever likely to visit. Made of strips of wood, this long, winding pier also has large sections ofgrass, making it an ideal place to have a picnic.Sunset through night time is the best to visit!(o^^o)"
Amazing!!,Minato Mirai is extremely beautiful. No words can describe the beauty of Yokohama in general and this place in particular.  Everything is plainly perfect.
Beautiful Yokohama,"Yokohama has different ambiance than Tokyo, its more relax and the skyscraper at Minato Mirai 21 look impressive during night. Its very beautiful and a must to visit, if you coming to Tokyo as its not too far via train."
Yokohama landscape,"Distinctive landscape of Yokohama. Majestic Mount Fuji is part of the landscape on a clear winter day. Beautiful by night, specially from Yokohama bay bridge. Must visit if you are in Japan, so many things to do. Take a leisurely walk or get a bargain while shopping at Landmark, Queens or Marine walk. Bring your family or love one to Red Bricks for lunch and enjoy the breathtaking views."
Playground of Yokohama ,"Enjoyed the carnival atmosphere in Yokohama, a city that takes fun seriously. Surrounded by the Tokyo Bay, it includes the Pacifico convention centre, a few hotels Like intercontinental, Tokyo Bay hotel , marine parks , a few malls plus the Cosmo World amusement park. You can spend a day or two slowly exploring the carefree place and yet aware that the city is only a 3-4 minutes ride away by subway..."
Best to visit at night,"Daytime offers very little in terms of visual impact.  The location is transformed when night falls, and it becomes like a light wonderland."
A welcoming future!,"It's really a such an amazing place! Open, welcoming, with a nice view and several activities to do- from shopping to taking a long walk to having drinks and food. It's the place that makes Yokohama competing in equal grounds with Tokyo. Definitely worth a visit! Ideal for everybody- romantic for couples, funny for children, friendly for elderly!"
Different ,Great atmosphere. Different kinds of things going on. Few types of malls and many places to eat. Nice place to walk around and great to visit the landmark tower that has top 360° views of the city.
Quite a beautiful place to visit,"Very well designed and so easily accessible. Quite an attractive harbour surrounded by well set out buildings with plenty of sites and attractions to see. Lots of shopping opportunities, not to mention plenty of places to eat. Would be very pretty to see the area from out on the water, to get a different perspective. Very impressed!"
"The ""Harbor of the future""","Welcome to the first harbor that was ""friendly opened"" from Commodore Perry!It's a large area full of things to see and to do!Must see also from the sea bass!"
"strong winds, nice view",the view was nice but the strong and cold winds prevented us from staying out for too long. the walk to the harbourview and the redbrick warehouses was long but interesting.
"Welcoming, attractive and open place","Being here alone for business purposes I found this district very accessible with nice sceneries (the wheel, the gorgeous nippon maru, skyscrapers and such) and much to do (shopping, eating and drinking). Absolutely worth a visit when you are here! You will not fill a day here and the best time for a visit would be around 4-5 pm and onwards (as many nice lighting in the evening)"
Yokohama みなとみらい21,"Beautiful place to take a walk and relax from the busy city. I strongly recommend to go to ""Osanbashi Pier"" to have a great view of Yokohama."
fanastic sightseeing harbor,"I was there on the night, it's very photogenic. free to entrance but hard to find some machine drink or street food, you must go to supermarkets or cafes."
Simply Amazing!!,"Simply WOW!  From the Osanbashi pier, the skyscrapers and the view of the Yokohama's CBD is a sight to admire. It is a must-do when in Yokohama :-)"
Highly recommended! Beautiful area - Minato Mirai 21,"Visited Minato Mirai (Yokohama) last year for a day trip and I fell in love with this place, so decided to stay here as a base for 5 nights. The overall stay was simply amazing. Christmas lights and decorations everywhere made the experience and ambiance wonderful!  Minato Mirai is basically a seaside urban area which was previously a shipyard many years ago. It's a beautiful place to visit.Recommended places to visit while you are here. The below are the places that I had visited.1. Landmark Tower - beautiful view of Minato Mirai and it's surroundings2. Cosmo World Ferris Wheel - you wont miss it and it looks beautiful at night.3. Yamashita Park - A beautiful place for a nice stroll to enjoy the sea breeze/view, next to Yokohama Chinatown and Motomachi Shopping Street.  (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)4. Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse - unique shops and restaurants. Again, looks beautiful at night.5. Yokohama Port Osanbashi  - Take a 20 mins walk from Minato Mirai Station here for a nice stroll and amazing view of Minato Mirai 21. Highly recommended!6. Loads of shopping malls - Queen's Square, The Landmark Plaza, The World Porters Mall, etc7. Cup Noodles Museum (for kids)8. Yokohama Chinatown - for Chinese food. (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)From Tokyo, just take a local train (35-45mins) to Yokohama station. From there, take the Minato Mirai Line to Minato Mirai station (5mins).  Have fun!If you think this review is useful, do click on the helpful button. Thank you"
what a wonderful nice place,"this is one of the most beautiful place I have ever seen..When I went there,there ware lot of Christmas light ups and it is very beautiful...dreaming to go there in again someday..lovely place"
Relaxing place in the midst of business district!,"It was a relaxing place walking along the waterfront! Coming from Tokyo, you will find yourself some breather in this place in Yokohama. You could find a place of solace, reading a book or just sit down with a beer enjoying the sea breeze with your loved ones! While I was there, I could see many young families, especially, bring along their children in strollers and dogs there. This place looks like an area for family outings. I went there in the daytime, perhaps you could find couples more in the night time. I believe the night scenery would be even more fantastic and provides a romantic place for couples there. If you have relaxed enough, pop into one of the shopping centres along the waterfront and start your adventure hunt again. Minato Mirai 21 is a place which provides people who likes to shop and at the same time chill along the waterfront. Truly enjoyed this place. Could have easily spent the whole day there!"
View,Just strolling around in this area . Walking distance to the main attraction in yokohama . 2 stations away from yokohama station.
Many Things to See and Do,"It’s a great area for walking around with many things to see and do.  The tallest building in Yokohama, Landmark Tower, is located here and has an observation deck on the 69th floor.  There’s an amusement park, Cosmo World, the Cupnoodles Museum, and several other museums here.  Yamashita Park and Chinatown are close by also.  We took the train from Ueno Station in Tokyo and arrived in Yokohama after about 30 minutes for a day trip.  One day wasn’t quite enough to see everything.  It was quite cold and windy walking about in November.  The area at night is quite colourful with all the lights."
Perfect,"Minato Mirai area is Yokohama for many tourists. A lot of things to do in this area, from shopping, walking, dining, Ferris wheel and amusement park (very limited) etc..You can enjoy a whole day in here. Highly recommended by night when the towers are all light up! Perfect setup for a great shot"
Gundam,"Understand the secondary yuan should be clear, yokohama is a lot of famous animation scenes, as anime powder must go to pilgrimage. Yokohama have a Gundam museum, there have a Gundam many people will take pictures. There are many models on display in the museum, selling type is complete, a carelessly will buy too much. If you want to see the night scenery of the yokohama to eat must first make an appointment in advance, otherwise there is no place to sit, my friends and I finally did not see the night scene while eating. But if you don't mind to see at night, there are many food shops are very cheap and delicious, choice is also very rich. After dinner we go to sit the ferris wheel, intentional, such as a fully transparent carriages, feel special stimulation, and also put the dinner on the ferris wheel didn't see the night scenery of all repair back."
Beautiful area on Yokohama Bay,"This area is very beautiful with open space, shopping malls, Cosmo world and lot's more. very nice place to walk around even if you don't plan to shop. The skyline is very beautiful. You can spend hours just walking around and enjoying the scenery. just 30mins from central tokyo."
Small park in the city,We only spend time in Yokohama 1 night we visit Minato Mirai 21 to try on underwater roller coasterit's only a small one actuallyand it's not really underwater only a (very) short passage under a splashing waterbut it's quite fun to spend the night in Minato Mirai
Good for shopping& sightseeing: All in one,"You can find all kind of diifferent attractions and entertainment for a spare day. Good restaurants and shopping malls arround the area. If you visit Yokohama, you don't have a better chance in the city."
Fun on the Bay - Feel like a Kid,"This area on Yokohama Bay was a surprise and a delight!   We were staying in a hotel on the bay with a balcony on the amazing ferris wheel which has lights that duplicate fireworks.   I've been to many international cities and have not seen that.   The fun rides, such as a rollercoaster appearing to dash into water, makes for great fun.   Additionally, nearby are restaurants and shops with authentic Japanese goods (also others, so watch for it).   We really enjoyed the beauty of the lights of the Minato Mirai 21 over the bay and the fun."
Great views of the skyline,"Theme park, skyline, & a great variety of places to shop.Nice day for a walk & look around.  And get some intersting pictures.Unfortunately the park was closed (ferris wheel / roller coaster), probably until the late spring, when temperatures are warmer."
"Modern city/area with plenty to see, eat and buy!","This is a very modern business area of Yokohama.  There are a ton of shopping and food options in the Minatomirai station building.  Above ground, you get a beautiful port view of Yokohama water front, very pleasant and enjoy by walking.  There is a cup-noodle museum in the area for those that are interested."
This area is the talk of the town!!!!,"Started off as a curiosity in the city, became an adventure, and ended as a memory to never be forgotten!!! Ferris wheel, roller coasters, G-force spinning rides, city life, arcades, and more!!!! Restaurants and shopping nearby!!!"
A lot of shoping,"This area is ultra modern with shops, shops, hotels, restaurants & shops. Plus a small amusement park and tower with observation deck. Very beautiful at night with all the lights."
Only if you're in yokohama,"Therr are good quality shopping malls with top fashioned and excellent fashion items.The sea is nice and the landscape also noce but come on, this is not the place becauae of it you came all the way to tokyo. So if you're in Yokohama due tp business or any other reason go for it, otherwise can be skipped"
"Minatomarai, Yokohama",My wife and I travel to Japan once or twice a year.  We take the bus from Narita to one of the hotels in Minatomirai and rest for one or two nights before moving into business or other events in Japan.  The hotels here are top grade and the multilevel plaza has excellent shops and restaurants.  The subway stop here is only one stop from Yokohama Train Station.
Harbour of the Future,"Minato Mirai 21 is a must-go if in Yokohama as it houses the many attractions that tourists are interested in such as Cupnoodles Museum, the Red Brick Warehouses, Cosmo World, and many shopping districts and malls. Visit the respective attraction pages for more information regarding them. Otherwise, very hard to miss if in Yokohama."
Busy business district,"It is a busy place, good shopping area, good number of excellent restaurants, even sea front and theme park area readily accessible, nearby public transport, worth spending there"
View of yokohama ,Great view of Yokohama with high speed elevator. I liked the view of the city from top . also nice spot for pictures.
A must visit in Yokohama!,"Yokohama is a great example of two sides of a city, conveniently demarcated by the train that passes through.  On one side, you have a sprawling concrete jungle filled, and on the other, a pleasant bay side area.  Minato-mirai is located on the bay side and does not typically represent one building or one park but is identified by a conglomerate of these.  You can have your fill of shopping delights, while with just a walk away is an amusement park for that extra fun.  But what really strikes you is how each attraction in the area compliments the other!  If you need to take a load off, just head to the pier (Osanbashi or Yamashita) and just sit back and relax.  The area is clean, well kept and definitely a must stay for anyone travelling to Japan!"
Fun outside,"Nice to be outside here, sometime there are street entertainers, You can go to Cosmos World and ride some rides in the city.  Good restaurants and pubs."
Great area to visit in Yokohama ,"If you are around Yokohama, can't miss this must of the city. Enjoy the large mall next to the pier and the view of the wheel!!!"
Classic boat tours and shopping,"Boat tours take you around this part of the Yokohama harbour which is less attractive than Hong Kong for instance. I found the Yokohama Museum of Art great for its sculptures. For ship lovers the Nippon Maru tall ship built in 1930 and decommissioned in 1984 is worth a tour. The Nippon Maru Memorial Park is actually not a park as one would expect lawns and trees, it's more concrete than nature, joggers use it.Shoppers can go to the Landmark Tower or the opposite Queen's Square or even to the more affordable World Porters on Shinko island, a 15-minute walk.Minato Mirai 21 is accessible from Yokohama station on the subway Blue Line, get off at Sakuragicho station."
MM 21,"This area is accessible via the MinatoMirai subway from JR Yokohama station. Queens Square Mall has just about everything you would want in a super mall. The local area features an amusement park, Landmark Tower and easy access to to the BayStars Ballpark and the Red Brick Warehouse Area."
Minato Mirai 21,"After the land-based, farm-centric visits to the castles and koens, I am reminded that Japanese are also maritime and sea-faring folks. The promenade is beautifully landscaped and scattered with statues and momentos of its maritime heritage. It is also excellent for day activities for kids as it has attractions and ferris wheel similar like in Osaka. If weather does not cooperate, you could spend several hours (and thousand dollars) shopping and eating and cinema at Collet Mare Shopping Malls. If you still have energy and credit limit in your card, head to the Aeon mall about 1 km from the station. For the Captain Haddock's fans, you must visit inside the Nipppon Maru. Allocate at least a full day for this - enjoy lunch outside."
Relax and enjoy,"Just arrived in YOk and after relax on my hotel I went out for a evening walk, and no rain this evening so all very nice. It is very beautiful here and clean and I enjoy the view. A day trip here tomorrow would be nice"
Beautiful at Night and during the Day!,"Take the water ferry to go to and from Yokohama Station and Yamashita Park to get a good view o Minato Mirai. There are malls, eateries, and a theme park in this area as well, making Minato Mirai a wonderful afternoon activity!"
Nice but require further own planning,We arrived and found that this area was quite big to check out in one afternoon. Really you need to plan ahead for this trip.Otherwise you end up not so relax to rush yourself for different tourist spots.
Relaxing Area,We enjoy going to this area to relax and walk.  Pick up a cold drink at a convenience store and go to sit on a bench. If it is not cloudy the sunsets are great. If you are chronic shopper there are so many places to spend your money.  The whole are is wonderful.
Nice walk. Impossible to do it on a rainy day,"Beautiful walk, i enjoyed a lot.My suggestion to eat is at Sarios. We had some decent meals there and not over priced, as many other places we saw in the way.Another great treat to enjoy is Paletas, a nice pops shop. Easy to find at the gate of the train station."
Flawless area in Yokohama ,"Minatomirai is without a doubt one of the nicest places in Yokohama. The business district is quiet, clean and modern. There's really nothing to complain about. Besides, it offers many possibilities for shopping and dining. Some notable buildings in Minatomirai are: the Landmark Tower, Queenstower A/B/C, MarkIs, World Porters, the Red Brick Warehouse, the Cup Noodles Museum and of course the iconic Cosmo Clock 21 which used to be the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. At night, every quarter of an hour an animated light show lights up the Ferris wheel for 5 minutes. The 10 remaining minutes are lit up green with a white pointer, imitating a huge green clock. There's also a beautiful harbor which is visited by many couples at night. I recommend going there at night to see the beauty of Minatomirai. Furthermore, a smaller but authentic entertainment district, Noge, is right around the corner near the JR Sakuragicho station. There are countless small bars (izakayas) and restaurants. It's the perfect place for grabbing a few drinks after work with your colleagues. Also worth visiting is the Chinatown near Motomachi station which is around 5 minutes by subway from Minatomirai station. It's been a pleasure working here; even after 3 months of work I couldn't stop taking pictures of Minatomirai on my way home."
Paradise for shopaholics,"Various shops with multi choices of high quality goods, it's really a paradise for shopaholics. They have a lot of restaurants and a big supermarket in the basement, really convenient."
If you stay Japan why not to visit typical modern city.,"Very clean, safe, have good shops restaurants.It' very modern, including traditional Japanese restaurants.You can find A class hotels."
Excellent for shopping,"If you are staying in a hotel in area, good shopping and great food below main floor.  Lots of inexpensive places for a good meal.  Take the esculators down."
Entertainment area,This is the family entertainment area near Minato Mirai station and port/red brick warehouse... Nice rides...
Place where you can immagine how Japan will look like in the future,"It doesnt feel like you are in a typical Japan city/district when you are here. It feels like you are in the futuristic Japan, very international and modern. Its name, Minato Mirai, literally means Future Port, does explain everything how this place was planned and expected to be.During summer, if you are lucky enough, there will be Fireworks display on one of its night. The fireworks usually last for 20-30 minutes continuesly or maybe more."
Stunning citylights,"Great view to embrace, day or night. Best place to see is on the roof of the port of Yokohama. When you visit in summer you may watch the fireworks in here and it is beautiful."
Priceless romantic night walk,"Splendid night view at no cost. Unlike many other big cities in the world, Yokohama minato mirai 21 is not over crowded in the evening and quite safe to walk.There are plenty of benches and spots where we can calmly sit and enjoy the view.There are some convenience store where we could fetch some munchies and made our own small picnic."
"Collection of Art, Engineering and Beauty all together.","An amazing mind taking place full of dream. Huge buildings, the port, the ships, ...  have created a lovely area deserves walking, watching and admire. I can not describe my sense using words, just go and feel."
Kids loved it,We stayed at Intercontinental which is right next door to the amusement park with the big Ferris wheel and the roller coaster and log flume. After days of temples and shrines kids were thrilled for some rides. There is a lot of American shopping in this area. It's fun for a half day in this area.
Lovely place to stroll,The area is beautiful and if you are lucky to visit during sakura (cherry blossoms season) you will be amazed by the beauty. You can stroll by the waterfront and gaze at the big wheel and the landmark tower. There are lots of shopping malls around (collette mare & markis) and lots of places to enjoy food.
Many shop to explore!,Nice shopping arcade. it's large and modern. full panoramic port view. this is the landmark to visit. no question.
Modern city,"Beautiful city. modern, clean and a lot shopping, big malls.Great place to spend a day walking, riding, shopping and eating."
Beautiful area with lovely views,"A lovely place to walk around in, whether you are visiting the conference center, going shopping or just walking around the place. Lots of food, clothes etc shops around and amazing views at night!"
"Minato Mirai 21 is a district area in Yokohama, with many attractions to visitt","I visited this place in end of July, 2016 and it was raining time there. But yet, this is enjoyable area, with your umbrella open"
Modern Japan,"Minato Mirai (modern port) is fairly representative of modern Japan.  The closest train stations are on the aptly named Minato Mirai line although you can also walk to closer parts from Yokohama or Sakaragicho stations.  Note it is long walk in the station from central Yokohama Station to the Minato Mirai line however, so if you have JR pass already, it is probably just as well to stick with the JR stations.In this area you can get to such landmarks as the Yokohama Landmark Tower (the tallest building in Japan when it opened) and the large Ferris Wheel in front of the Cosmo Amusement Park.  You can also see the Yokohama Bay Bridge from this area.  There is lots of shopping including the Red Brick Warehouses.  We came here to visit the Cup Noodles Museum.The whole area is prettier in the evening when the lights turn on."
Beautiful area,We loved all the walkways and well kept flower gardens and parks around the harbour area.  We walked around the area for 2 days and loved the relaxed atmosphere.  the whole area feels open and spacious.  There are ample shops nearby if natural scenery is not your thing!
AWESOME,You can see it from the bridge and the night view is awesome! I took many photos at the bridge! And don't forget the ferris wheel!
Lovely walk,This area is the heart of Yokohama with everything you want from 5 star hotels to local and international food. We also went on the boat which had karaoke and a chef for dinners we had a group of 10 great food and drink poor singers.
It's okay I suppose,"Unless there is something interesting going on at the red brick warehouse, I wouldn't go out of my way. Nothing special"
Lovely to behold and good shopping,"It's a big shopping area - if that's what you want, then you'll be happy. The view from our hotel (The New Otani Inn) overlooks Minato Mirai and made for some stunning pictures both by day and by night.The tall ship Nippon Maru is anchored here but every single day we were available to take the tour, the box office was closed. Even on sunny days. So it was a disappointment not to be able to tour this majestic tall ship, especially when one has to walk right by it every time one is out!The moving walkways between the New Otani Inn and the Landmark Hotel (where a good deal of the shopping and restaurants are located) are a real step-saver. Shops I liked in the area include the Hard Rock Cafe, Starbucks, the grocery store and convenience store. If I were a little more adventurous in the dining category, I would have had a good time exploring the many Asian restaurants on the basement floor. We did enjoy Kissho on the 5th floor of the Landmark for shabu shabu, although it was a bit pricey for the value.Overall, if you're a shopper, this is the place for you. If you're not, then it's just another pretty Asian mall area."
Amazing area!,"Amazing area! An area where you can eat anything from around the world, with museums, amusement park, shopping an cruise!"
Big shopping center,Lots of brand name shops including Tokyo Hands. Lots of small restaurants that serve local food. Attached to hotel and subway  that makes it convenient.
Symbol of Yokohama,I visited there because of participation of International congress.The area is worth visiting not only for meeting but for shopping and eating. Scenery itself  is fabulous.
Beautiful waterfront,"While Kyoto and Nara represent the ancient Japan, Minato Mirai shows you the most modernized Japan. It is absolutely worth to visit Minato Mirai 21, when you travel to Japan. This area is not only good for taking walk, but also good for shopping and entertainment."
A place to see in Yokohama,Since Yokohama is quitte close to Tokyo you should visit this. There are a lot of activities you can enjoy around this area. There are great restaurants and malls in the area. There are some museums you might like and the Yokohama tower that you can visit.
Very beautiful Landmark,"Went here with a friend at night. This place is superb. So beautiful, bright, but so quiet and serene. This is one of the best landmark I ever visited in Japan. By around 8 pm only a few people can be seen around here."
Simply beautiful and entertaining. Highly recommended!,"I had such a great and amazing day trip at Yokohama (especially around the Minato Mirai 21 area) that I am planning another trip to Japan, specifically to Yokohama in Dec to spend a few days! If you are in Tokyo, I would highly recommend you visit Yokohama - either a day trip or spend a couple of days here. It is just 35-45mins by train from Tokyo (Shimbashi to Yokohama). The view (both day time and night time) of the Yokohama port is simply stunning! Spent a couple of hours just walking along side the port and taking in the beautiful view. Interesting places to visit around this area are - Landmark Tower Sky Garden (great view of Yokohama from the top), Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier (stunning view!), shopping malls, Hard Rock Cafe Yokohama, Cup Noodles museum and many more! One can easily spend a day here, which is what we did.We took a train from Shimbashi on the JR Tokaido Line to Yokohama station, which cost us 470yen - so easy and convenient. If you think this review is useful, please click on the ""helpful"" button. Thank you!"
Magnificient view of Minato Mirai,A scenic view along the bay area of Yokohama. A beautiful view of the city line with great architectures. Day time views are great on a bright sunny day enjoying the sea breeze.
Plan you day here,"There is such an enormous amount of things to do and see, it is best to plan what you want to do here and stick to it. I'll be here for 3 months and already realize that it will be impossible to visit every restaurant here, even if I only frequent each on once."
Great for shopping and eating,This area consists of many buildings and there are many shops for a variety of goods. There are also many choices of restaurants located in different buildings. If you are traveling with kids then the theme park will be great for them.
A day in yokohama,Nice view and very windy in june. Great scenery. Worth going for a stroll in the park .for those who love photography.
Great View of Yokohama,"For ¥700 you can catch the view of the whole Yokohama bay! The staffs would get a picture of you at the base of the ferris wheel as a momento (you have to pay for the photo, can't remember how much). Recommended for couples and families and don't forget to bring your camera along."
Can't miss it,"The heart of Yokohama. Business offices, shops, restaurants, cafes... everything is there. Step up the tall buildings to have the best view of the huge harbour. You can also see Tokyo itself from the top floors of these skyscrapers."
You have to visit if you are in Yokohama,Yokohama has many locations to visit and enjoy. Minato Mirai 21 is the best place to enjoy new and old of Yokohama.Minato Mirai 21 has many buildings and nice river and olden days Red bricks and so on.
Great area to walk around to see the sights and take photos,"Recommend the area for sightseeing, photography and relaxing. We also spotted several water birds, and admired some of the remaining cherry blossoms."
Fun little area,"From the main station we got the a train to Minato Mirai, which is the seaside urban area of the city. There were a large amount of skyscrapers and everything looked very modern."
Beautiful views and relaxing time,"We went to Yokohama and fell in love with this city. We went up to the top of Landmark tower building (no free entrance) to contemplate the amazing views, you may have a seat and relax taking your time. You will find some stalls while visiting the tower and have a drink or have a caricature picture.After we went to the bridge and have an spectacular views from the other side including this time the buildings in it, we had our dinner sitting down on the benches as it was a sunny day.Have some time to go and visit it!"
Wonderful view on the ocean,"Very worth to visit, expecially at night. The view on the Ocean is marvellous and romantic. The place has many shops and malls."
Nice city center location,"Very modern, and, as everywhere in Japan, clean, convenient and safe.  Lots of places to find great food.  Lots of nice Karaoke clubs."
Good shopping and eating,"No shortage of places to eat, something for every palate. Tons of shops, clothes from designer to more down-to-earth. Speciality shops include kitchen wares, jewellery, gifts, and lots of outdoor stores. I spent about 3 hours there and I'm sure I didn't cover a tiny fraction of everything around."
Spectacular view from Landmark Tower.,Looks like fairy land just on dark with all lights twinkling. Saw the elusive Mt Fuji in the other direction
Lovely fairground and area to spend time,We visited on the last day of our Japan visit and it is an ideal place to visit if you are overnighting at Haneda airport.  We went on the massive ferris wheel and it was reasonable at Y1200 for a family of three.  I would recommend going at dusk as the building illuminations and views from the ferris wheel are superb.
Refreshing,I went there both during day and night. It was full of Pikachus statues not far from the ship and there were some performances where an army of Pikachus dance along to the music. There's also a theme park nearby but I didn't ride any of the rides. During night time I just love the colourful Ferris wheel rotating slowly. It gives the livelier look for Minato Mirai.
Full potential yet to be realised,"Shopping and dining are fine although they may require a bit of walking. Dining is a bit pricey. More greenery such as parks would be good for families. Port side not fully utilised as a sightseeing spot and selection of restaurants, leisure activities are limited. Good as a business district but needs more creative interventions for tourists. No night life. Poor access by trains except for Minatomirai station area."
Great place..! Lots to see...!,"Wonderful experience here.It has a great atmosphere, quite scenic.It was so beautiful. I recommend u to go there at night ."
Japanese is amazing to build here.,"wonderful experience here, you can't stop your foot to walk around here, I been here few times, but still a lot attracting me.If you plan your trip in Tokyo, you can't miss here!"
"Shopping, transportation and mulling","This is an adventure to appeal to the off hours of business life. It has classic stores, name brands, restaurants from food courts to 4 star and a great transportation center - makes it a more interesting stay in a very industrial city."
Shop till you drop,Shop till you drop and everything you can think of . The views the walk around the area are stunning
"Can spend a whole day walking, shopping, eating and admiring the view!","This area is a great place to just walk around and admire the beautiful view.  Of course, shopping and eating is another way to spend the time as there are so many places to check out.  The view from the Landmark Tower is wonderful if you're not afraid of the height too.  The lights at night are also pretty so you can spend the whole day here if you have time."
A shopping paradise,"We didn't really spend much time here other than looking for lunch as it's more for shoppers. Worth dropping by if you have time to spare but with so many shopping areas in town, one can give this a miss if you are in a rush or short of time."
great time,we stayed at intercontinental hotel and location is very good and fascinating especially at night. there was a lot of restaurants shops and entertainment amenities. we spent some hours every evening at this place.
Plenty of shopping,Small parks around the place. As a place to spend a day of tourism a little dull. Cosmo land and landmark hotel sky garden all in the same area.
Yokohama cosmopolitan area,When going to Yokohama this is one of those places that most of the locals will recommend you to go and they are right. We enjoyed a lot the Minato Mirai area. Here you can find malls and promenade places and also a cup noodle museum.
lots to see with your family,"There is an amusement park, 5 shopping malls, and great park beside sea. You must enjoy with your whole family, even grandparents! Tip: Enjoy food but avoid the lunch time and the dinner time!"
Spectacular scenery and jogging route,"I love jogging around the Minato Mirai 21 area from Yamashita park. The front Ocea view is spectacular, th magnificant skyline of the Landmark Tower, Panpacific Hotel and Intercontinential is always so pleasing to my eyes. There are also many shopping Malls and restaurant tourists can enjoy."
Port of Great City,"One of main tourist attractions in Yokohama. Here you can see amusement park, a big ship that now been used as a museum. it's near Sakuragicho station, and also still in walking distance with another tourist attraction, such as: red brick house, Yokohama Landmark Tower, and Yamashita park"
Definitely worth seeing,A lovely modern area with a big shopping centre. If you come to Yokohama you can't miss out on this. You can definitely spend a good few hours browsing about.
Very cool!,"Ideal for walks, this area features an interesting array of attractions, and gorgeous harbour-side views. It looks especially beautiful at night, like a vision from the future. It also has a much more relaxed atmosphere than nearby Tokyo."
YOKOHAMA,"If you boring Tokyo during stay in Japan, Yokohama is good place for one day excursion. The city is traditional harbor town from Edo period. Or if you are planning to get Kamakura from Tokyo, you'll pass Yokohama."
I love this place!,"Actually i should say that i prefer Yokohama to Tokyo, and this place is one of the reasons. It is a place full of history, one of the first harbor that met the European and American culture during the last centuries. I love this place especially during the sunset..."
"Tokyo has Odaiba, Yokohama has Minato Mirai 21","Minato Mirai 21 in Yokohama is the place to be.  Shopping, beautiful areas to take photos, hang out with your family at the nearby park, it's no doubt one of the most beautiful locations to visit in the area.With that being said, to get to various locations, you'll need to walk and get used to walking long distances as there is no public transportation that will take you there or to Osanbashi.  So, have good shoes/socks before going to this location.  And if you haven't walked long distances in awhile, get in the habit of doing so, if you plan to visit this location.But definitely check out the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris Wheel, the Landmark tower, Osanbashi, Yokohama Bay Bridge and more!"
Hello Japan 2121. ,"This is the what the Japan promised by future-looking movies and anime looks like. Massive mall complexes above and below ground, huge pedestrian boulevard at multiple levels, shiny sky scrapers, overly calm female voices announcing stuff via intercoms every few minutes. Probably a paradise for fashionistas/spree shoppers. I just went for the MegaCity vibes"
Awesome place in yokohama,Best place to visit in Yokohama. Great views in the evening when lighting glows up.Good amusement park and hotels. Nippon-maru ship is  must for viewing.go any time in year
The Best of Yokohama!,"Minato Mirai is probably the best part of Yokohama. A bold statement, yes, but the mix between fun places to go historical places ti see, and delicious places to eat make Minato Mirai next to none on the fun-scale. This is a pretty perfect spot to spend a day walking around or even a weekend with friends. I highly recommend the Red Brick Warehouse for a fun afternoon, Landmark Tower for shopping and a great view, and The Dockyard for a few tasty places to eat after your busy day."
Views to treasure,"When visiting Yokohama, it is a must to visit Minato Mirai. Not only for shopping lovers but food lovers too. It has it all, fine dining, local cheap, restaurants, fast foods, bars, shops and more shops , plenty to choose from. It attracts both seniors and juniors as it has something to offer for every one from low budget to big spenders. Its immaculately clean !! No litter here.!!"
Great place to enjoy an evening (for free),"Stroll along Minato Mirai while straining your neck to see how tall the Landmark Tower is and admiring the beautiful Nippon Maru training ship at the front. The humongous Ferris wheel in the amusement park houses one of the biggest digital clocks in the world. A small amphitheater close to the Hardrock Cafe, Yokohama, often has a brilliant performance of jugglery or sorts in the evenings. Lots of places to eat, but may be a tad steep, given that this is an expensive part of the city. Recommend walking towards the Sakuragicho station for cheap eats"
"Beautiful modern buildings, ferris wheel, and traditional ship","The train station to get off is Sakuragicho, then it's just a matter of walking out of the station, and the stunning view is there to see. Cross the road to get an even better view. There's a ferris wheel in the background, and there's also a traditional ship (Nippon Maru) nearby. There's a bridge if you want to get closer to the ferris wheel."
Great part of town!,"This area is expensive, but anything you might want to find is here.  History, tourism, scenic views, picture spots, fine dining, cheap eats.  Oh, and shopping and more shopping.  You name it is here.  Easy to access via the Sea Bass or the train."
the hub-hub of Yokohama,"When in Yokohama, it is a must to visit Minato Mirai. Not only for shopping lovers but food lovers too. It has it all, fine dinning, casual restaurants, fast foods, bars, shops and shops and shops, plenty to choose from. It attracts both seniors and juniors as it has something to offer for every one from low budget to top dollar payers"
Shopping spree,"We enjoyed the shopping and dining at Minato Mirai. Beautiful shops and good restaurants all over the place. Super modern and lots of fun! The high rise hotel lights are a spectacular view at night. The panoramic view from atop Landmark Tower is wonderful too, lots of things to do for all ages!!"
Great Shopping experience,"Lot of shopping options for all age groups... !!... also, since the sea is very near, u can do a small boat ride.... there is a cosmo park - for adventure rides.... overall a full day of fun... !!"
A small area with many attractions and entertainment.,"This is a dense entertainment area all within a couple minutes of walking from attraction to attraction.  You will find Cosmo World, an amusement park, and a bunch of shopping districts such as Queen's Square and Porters.  There is also the Cup Noodle museum right by Porters within a 3 minute walk.  Bring your camera and snap a picture at night!  The skyline is amazing.  Be warned it is very easy to spend most of your day in this single area, and that's not good especially if your vacation in Japan is only a couple days!"
Place to See,Although this may not appeal to all taste I found Minato Mirai 21 one of the most interesting places to visit in Yokohama. Pictures at sunrise can be impressive.
Modern City within a City,"We stayed at the Yokohama Bay Hotel which was part of the whole development consisting of offices, malls, exhibition centres and amusement parks etc...very interesting indeed...could not have guessed that the entire area is almost 30 years old as the buildings still look new...very clean area...lots of malls and eateries to satisfy one's taste..."
Six Day Trip to Japan,"This is a delightful part of the city to stay, or visit. There are so many great places to see at this part of the city, from the big Shopping Mall at the train station with well known shops and brands, the small adventure park, but best of all - the superb walks along the water front with the bay view. Just remember to bring warm clothes with you at this time of year as it does get cold!"
Hours needed to explore this rich area,"Perfect place to spend the time in Yokohama. It's packed with walkways, sculptures, ships, hotels, shops, restaurants, museums and parks and even a big-wheel. Very clean, easy to get around and lots of facilities. Seems it was first developed over 30 years ago for the World Expo - but it still appears 'so new'."
BAY BIKE,"風の少ない晴れた日は、本当にただ歩くだけぶらぶらするだけ、おススメです。疲れたらTSUTAYAのスタバでお茶が良いですよ！登録が必要ですが、ベイバイクが便利。It's a nice place to just walk or to jog, if the wind is not too strong.  It's even better if you rent a Bay Bike, it takes you to other interesting Yokohama area faster and cheaper, such as China Town or Yamashita Park.  But registration is needed beforehand, that's a little time consuming.  It's 150 yen per 30 minutes, you can drop them off at any Bay Bike spots.  All the bicycles are with motors, it is really convenient.The view from the sky scrapers makes you feel like you're in Singapore, not in Japan.  Starbucks with the book store, Tsutaya, is a recommendable place to have a break.  Have a cup of coffee and read something you like, as long as you treat the books right they are all free to read at your seat!"
Home for Three years,"This is a very beautiful modern area for yokohama.  My husband and I lived in Minato Mirai for three years, our apartment over looked Yokohama Harbor, It's a must to visit if in Yokohama, there is so much to see and do, excellent shopping, landmark tower, red brick warehouse, boat tours, ocean walk, beautiful parks, museums and great restaurants."
Port of the Future,The name itself implies this is a port of the future. A rather futuristic look is available in here especially when Cosmo 21 Ferris wheel is lit up. * You can walk here from Yamashita Park or take Minatomirai Line to Bashamachi Station.
Best place in the city,"My favorite place. Good for everyone! Shopping, food, stuff for the kids, the list goes on.Best place to be for pictures in the evening and it's so clean and people are so friendly. I wish I could live here for the rest of my life!!!"
Yokohama's newest center,"Minato Mirai offers great shopping, an excellent art museum and concert hall, and fun events. There's always something new happening."
Great Place to take the Kids,I have come here many times with my children and each time there are new places to go and explore.  It is good in all seasons as well.
Another trip to my fav city,I took the express train and walked. The area is great for eating; malls; boat rides; Krispy Creme; French Bakeries; High end shopping as well; parks; rides for children. There are Museums in the area also. Please Visit the area.
Gleaming gem by the bay,"Perfect place to stay and spend the time in Yokohama. It's packed with so many things - hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, shops, museums, parks and even amusement park. You'll be spoilt for choice.Great accessibility, good facilities. Everything is clean and well-maintained."
Romantic in the evening..,"This is where I grew up...  and I always return to Yokohama.  Minato Mirai area was developed over 3 decades ago for the World Expo.  The Ferris Wheel is illuminated in the evening and the light reflects on the surface of the water around it.  It's very beautiful.  Recommended to anyone, especially for couples.  Visit in December for the clear sky for you may be in for a treat with the beautiful view of Mt. Fuji!"
Loved the place,Fine place with a nice vibe. This is a very interesting place to have a morning or evening stroll with the family while enjoying the magnificent scenery.
"Great for kids, families and couples!","Easy access, lots of facilities and a brilliant night view make this a really nice spot to spend a few hours."
Minato Mirai makes Yokohama unique,"Water, modernity, space, intensive live, wonderful skyline, Minato Mirai is indeed the harbour of the future. Master piece of urban planning, the business centre of Yokohama benefits from the many canals and curled sea boarder, giving it a feeling of space not easily found elsewhere in Japan. The view is great from many different places, particularly at night. It is was however worth going up the Yokohama tower  (I was fortunate to have received an invitation, lucky me)."
nice play for shopping and restaurants,A good area for shopping and eating... loads of choices are available.cosmo world is too good for adults as well as children.
Nice old warehouse turn to shopping mall now,"Beautiful old warehouse build more than 200 years ago started to reuse about 15years ago and became famous shopping site. But, aaaaaaalways too busy to eat at cafe or restaurant. My recommendation is, just watch shopping and try not eat or relax at restaurant here as long as you love to be in long queue waiting more than an hour!"
Nice area for wonder around!,A good area for shopping and eating! A lot of choices and we also enjoyed walking around the surrounding area.
"Great for families, couples, everyone!","Lovely night views, great entertainment- shopping, Cosmo World theme park with scary vertical coaster and the giant ferris wheel, beautiful restaurants/ foodcourts, cup noodle museum, all within 6 min of the station. Easy to navigate and walk around with kids, attractions like Aquarium, Mitsubishi industrial museum, Nippon Maru.Area opens till late, surrounded by lovely hotels, water and parks, can take seabass water taxi to Read Brick warehouse and Yamashita Park."
Lovely bay area in Yokohama city,Sometime i go to landmark tower in this area for work and always love this area. Beautiful building and beautiful bay area. You just have to keep walking and you will feel relaxed. Local buses and cycle rental also available. but i love walking in this area.
Smashing Night view and take your breath away,Nice view and walkable attractions. Very good locations for couples and families. The entire area just brings your mind out of your daily problems and so. Its very much worth to go there.
nice entertainment area in Yokohama,"Nice entertainment area, including a few malls, attractions for kids, the Big Wheel, and a couple of museums worth a visit (unfortunately the Art Museum was closed for exhibition changing, I wonder why the permanent collection could not be accessible_"
Beaitiful ,"When I went there with my friend , it was so beautiful . I recommend u to go there at night . And I had very good time there I wanna go there again"
Put on your to list!,"Combine this with the Nissin Ramen museum and amusement park which is right across the street. Simple to get to from the train station. Just look at the picture, it is exactly like that. Called MM21, mega cool food court with an area which resemble Hawaii. Too much to list to buy BUT you can buy  Kit-Kat in many odd flavor a that only Japan offers. Potato, cheese, green tea, coke, and other crazy flavors. Lots of people there. Cute girls and cool guys. Be careful if your on a budget because you'll spend a lot in this place. Oh and 10 minutes walk is the famous Red Brick building on the bay. Actually you will spend all day within this area. Go for it. Bring a map and a small blanket so you can catch a cat nap in the bay park."
Loved the lights!,"Minato Mirai looks lovely in the evenings, when festive lights are added to all the light coming from the shops and buildings. You'd need to spend more than a couple of hours here, what with shops, more shops, and the ferris wheel."
Heaven on a Earth!,"There so many things to see and enjoy here! We were fortunate enough to have spent 4 nights here in one of 5 stars hotel in this area. (See my separate review). Most of Yokohama bay's shops, restaurants, attractions, are nearby!"
You must visit this place!,"This place is beautiful. There is so much to see and do, including just walking around by the water. When we were here there was a brass band playing, people singing, others attending ocktober fest. You can also walk up on to the bridge where you will see amazing sights. It is a lovely area!"
Quite incredible,"Futuristic Japan blended with older architecture, Yokohama and this area in particular, should not be so neglected by tour books and it really is a superb place to look around."
Yokohama’s ‘centre of gravity’.,"Minato Mirai (Harbor of the Future) offers many shopping and dining options. Access by train is easy since Minato Mirai Station is right in Queen's Square (basement level). We took a day trip from Shibuya with a valued Yokohama-MM Pass.Much of the Minato Mirai 21 area where the Landmark Tower stands are reclaimed land. We skipped the Sky Garden of the Landmark Tower (highest observation deck in Japan, miss the thrilling 360° panoramic view..) but zoomed into ground level instead. There are many Cafes and souvenir shops and we are happy with just window-shopping. The many shopping and entertainment facilities gathered here include the Yokohama Museum of Art, the Mitsubishi Minatomirai Industrial Museum where you can learn about the universe and energy, and Warner Cinemas Minato Mirai multiplex movie theaters. The Cosmo World amusement park has the world's largest Ferris wheel but also functions as a clock. There is also the famous Cup Noodles Museum, shopping at World Porter (our favourite!!), Landmark Plaza, Queen's Square.  A little beyond, by foot, will be the Red Brick Warehouse and where one can stroll along the waterfront and the promenade at Yamashit Park.We loved this place which can be best seen and experience by just walking about.!  Cannot help making reference to Kobe HabourLand. It is also fun and awesome place to spend one’s evening here; evening is the best time to see MM21 and its wonderful lights (esp the beautifully lighted up giant ferries wheel). It sure feels very romantic strolling along the promenade, simply spectacular!There are many simply too many things to do in Minato Minai and one cannot but just lament that we did not have enough time to take it all in. !!  Come appreciate for yourself."
Nice place to a day trip,Really beautiful place for a day trip! Easily accessible by train and have a lots of activities for children as well. You can enjoy citi view from skygarden from 69 th floor.
Central!,"Nice place to be, many hotels and shops and restaurants, busy on the weekends, close to the harbor and train station."
Essence of Yokohama,"This area is in my opinion the essence of Yokohama. The main attractions of the city are in the reasonable walking distance. There's a small amusement park around the bay to keep you or your kids entertained and of course lots of shopping everywhere. If you're feeling like waking a bit more, Akarenga Red Brick Halls are about 15 - 20 minutes away on foot, with Ramen Museum on the way there. Further from Akarenga there's Oosabashi Pier and after another 2km you arrived at China Town :). Great place to start your walk around Yokohama, or to hang out as it provides entertainment for an entire evening."
"Truly an lovely place for a stroll, with scenic spots almost everywhere","As per my title, you can go picture crazy here, as there are just so many spots to take awesome pictures. It is again a totally different scene when the sun sets and the cooler wind sets in. Dont miss this place; easily accessible too."
Lovely view,"Minato Mirai is a pretty place, and nice to get away from a lot of the hustle and bustle of other places surrounding it. I didn't do much, just walked around here but it was still nice and calming."
a good place for living,I had worked and lived here for 2 years.I was in the highest building of Queen square. It's a good place for working and living.It's comfortable to walk along the sea and the park.The Yamashita park is not far from here.There are fireworks event in summer evening every year.
Lots of Elbow Room,"Did a walking loop around the area from Landmark Plaza, to World Porters, and back.  Combined with a bright blue sky (and high heat), the scenery was beautiful and made for some really great photographs.  After spending many days in Tokyo, this area definitely gave you a better feel of wide open spaces in an urban environment, with the venues also having a sense of being visually connected.  A contrast to Odaiba, which does the wide open spaces thing well, but connected only by the Yurikamome.  I wasn't able to stick around for sunset (weather was changing quickly), but will have to take a night time stroll on a future visit.Also, the now-annual Pikachu Dance Invasion was in full swing when I was there, and you could not escape seeing the little yellow Pokémon everywhere throughout the district."
Good locations and lots to do,"There is a bit of everything here, shopping mall, food, and entertainment.  The subway drops you off here and then you can to different areas and spend the day here."
Relaxed pier atmosphere,"We walked through probably a small section of Minato Mirai on the way to Cosmo World from Yokohama station and we passed by numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, museums, hotels, a big ship (Nippon Maru) before reaching the theme park. It has a great atmosphere, quite scenic and very well connected by train systems or walkways."
Great for shopping and dining!,"Tons of shopping, restaurants and if you're lucky, a Pikachu Outbreak! Wear your walking shoes, there are several shopping malls all clumped together and more restaurants and cafes than you can count!"
Great Place to stay and visit,"I have stayed in this area 4 times during the last few months and thoroughly enjoy every visit. I have stayed at the Landmark hotel and the Intercontinental both of good quality, ideally located and with great views of the local area. They are several good shopping malls and numerous restaurants to cater for all tastes. Always extremely well maintained and immaculately clean. The area is well served by the underground train system and is within easy reach of Tokyo and beach resorts such as Kamakura. Definitely worth a visit."
Landmark afternoon,"Nice area to shop, browse and just people watch. Very easy to reach via public transportion. Landmark Center and every luxury brand you can think of is there, and a small amusement park."
