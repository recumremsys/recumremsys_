Nice,Building is beautiful on the outside. Went inside (150 roebel entry price) but that was a mistake. Not much to see there. Would not recommend going inside.
Fantastic carved exterior ,"I loved the fabulous carving on the exterior of the cathedral.  Lots of funny lions, which are also on the inside.Beautiful frescos."
Unique cathedral. Worth the visit,"It is different from other Russian churches, mainly because of the external artwork on the walls. Historical and biblical characters as well as invented and real figures cover the walls. You can spend a long time watching them and trying to understand why are they there. It is a must when visiting Vladimir"
Saint Demetrius,Has description in English and great place to step by on your way to other sightseeing. Amazing stone work dating to 11xx
Very beutiful and tiny ortodox cathedral in Vladimir,"Cathedral os Saint Deemetrius is one of the main religious ortodox buildings in Vladimir, a city located in the Golden Ring, an historical place surrounded Moscow. The cathedral is very beautiful and tiny, it is easily recognizable. In fact, it is located near Holy Assumption Cathedral. Also, the inner part is very well decorated and nice, so it is a very nice visit in the city, (See also Holy Assumption Cathedral, Golden Gate and Monument to Prince Vladimir)"
Look at the sculptures on the outside,"It doesn't get at much press as the larger cathedral 100 yards away, but it is more historic. Although the interior is rather bare and museum like, its exterior is spectacular. How did those carvings survive the years of harsh weather?"
Superb site in Vladimir,"I visited the Cathedral of Saint Demetrius in Vladimir, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with a tour guide to explain the details and sketch the historic background. The site, which is magnificent with an atmosphere of deep spirituality, is well worth a visit."
See the Exterior,"Don't bother paying to see the inside, there's not much there. The carved exterior is what you want to see. Each small scene one tells a story in pictorial form."
Beautiful church,Vladimir boasts of multiple beautiful churches and this is one of them...you can spend short time admiring its architecture
Unique die to its stone carvings,"A small cathedral that can only be admired from outside. The stone carvings on the walls make this building quite unique, with for example, many small lions to spot. Closed to the public."
Small but beautiful,The Cathedral locates near to Holy Assumption Cathedral but much smaller in size.  This single-dome Cathedral is simple in outlook but still considered worthwhile to spend some time to have a look inside.
Complement to visiting the Dormition cathedral,"This Cathedral is only a few minutes from the more popular and larger Cathedral of the Assumption or Dormition. It is of a much smaller surface although very tall, it is austere in decoration inside, no huge iconostasis like that in the Dormition, but still the exterior white limestone is richly decorated.Personally I would recommend to visit both Cathedrals, even with a small entrance fee, well worth seeing these immense buildings which must have impressed even more than  900 years ago, as they impress visitors still today."
Small but interesting,"This small Cathedral is simple and modestly decorated internally. The history of it is explained on a board in front of the building, in English as well.This is a monument to the ancient Russian architecture. The stones are carved as showing biblical scenes. The external walls are carved up to the roof including the main tower. King David and King Solomon are the stars.The small inner part is modest and nice by its simplicity. From its upper yard nearby there is a nice view of the area. The Cathedral is not active and free."
Small but interesting,"A few original frescoes of the 12th century have survived.  Although smaller, it's a must see.  It is withing walking distance of the Cathedral of Assumption."
Gorgeous,"Splendid white stone carving, myths become alive on the walls of the cathedral. And you can't miss a small viewpoint a few steps away. Strongly recommend."
A UNESCO World Heritage site built in 1190s,"So cool to check this historic place. The cathedral is one-domed and four-pillared. Originally it was surrounded by galleries with towers that connected it to the prince's palace. They were demolished during the restoration in the 19th century. The church is famous for its white-stone carvings - its walls are decorated with ca. 600 reliefs, depicting saints, mythical and real animals. Most of the reliefs are preserved in their original form, some have been replaced during the restoration of the 19th century. Out of the internal decoration a few fragments of frescoes of the 12th century have survived, particularly fragments of the Last Judgement composition.Currently, the cathedral is a part of the Vladimir-Suzdal open-air museum."
Near to Holy Assumption but smaller,"Certain to be included in most tours of Vladimir, this cathedral is smaller and less ostentatious than many others."
Wonderful ,I'm astonished about the architecture in all cities I've visited in Russia and Vladimir is not an exception: this church is pretty near a complex of churches and maintain attractions just a walk distance each other. Amazing
"A wonderful edifice, a feast for the eyes",This early edifice which is dedicated to Saint Demetrius is one of the most elegant structures in the Golden Rings. You should circumvent it from all sides to admire its proportions and the decorations on the walls. A truly magnificent piece of architecture.
Fantastic!,"If without the plate stated that it’s “St. Demetrius Cathedral 1193-1197”, we would have not known this fantastic church was. It’s on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. We saw statue of Prince of Vladimir at the far side “park”. And a railroad said could go all the way to Siberia at another far side."
Small but Impressive,Not really worth the ticket to go inside as it's very small. And almost all the descriptions were in Russian.
Russian Romanesque or a must-see medieval experience of the old capital,"Why to see: UNESCO World Heritage monument of the 12th century, probably the most typical and indicative white-stone building of the premongolian period in Russia.  What to see: the facades)) a truly unique composition of King David, Alexander the Great, Prince Vsevolod, Hercules, saints, lions, griffins etc... all in all up to 1500 mastepieces of white-stone carving (though estimates may vary) giving a vivid picture of russian medieval (political? spiritual? cultural?) outlook.     the interior: not as decorative as the facades but still pretty interesting. there is a tiny museum exibition inside with several showcases (archeological artifacts) and information boards that briefly tell the history of the cathedral and its carvings (1 or 2 are in english and quite helpful). Add a piece of 12th century fresqo paintings (considered the work of greek artists) under the choir gallery and an impressive burial of the first Vladimir governer Roman Vorontsov in the south-west corner of the church (left of entrance).     Don't forget to: - give your explanation on the ""crescent"" part of the cross on top of the church- investigate the origins of red brick that surrounds the cathedral on 3 sides- ask yourself about a pelican in the burial monument inside  - close both heavy doors at the entrance as there is a sign in russian that asks to do so))) Mind that the cathedral is used as a museum (no religious services) and the entrance is chargeable. Though it's just 80 rubles for adults. Kids under 16 or even 18 enter for free and students have a discount. Working hours are 11-18 in summer (may-october) and 10-17 in winter (november-april), on monday it closes an hour earlier. Days off are all tuesdays and last wednesdays of every month. Taking photos is allowed and is free of charge. Personal tip: get close to the northern wall (it is almost always in the shade) and just look up at the carvings trying to imagine what used to happen here centuries ago..."
The best in Vladimir,"Beautiful place, beautiful proportions, tricky stonecarving. Definitely worth seeing, but the best view on the cathedral is from the 2nd or 3rd floor of the nearby museum's windows."
Gorgeous,"Gorgeous... everything here on this trip was gorgeous. Take pictures and if you want to buy souvenirs, buy it here vs Moscow... it's much cheaper!"
Part of our history.,This small cathedral - the best in the city from the point of view of a combination informative and spiritual. Wants to learn something new and to reflect. Remarkable architecture and strict interior. Part of our history.
800 years of arcitecture and design,Really great looking place. Old and charming. It's really sad that we can't do like this now after 800 years of progress.
World heritage,It's the unesco world heritage. You can park car very near to the cathedral. Really it has most decorated walls. I couldn't enter inside. This cathedral located near to the  park so you can take a walk and have rest on the benches near fountain.
Small austere looking church,"This small cathedral sits almost next to its big brother the Assumption cathedral and therefore it sort of gets looked down upon. Although it looks very austere and simple, the exterior walls of the church are covered with elaborate carvings. It was built in the 12th century.The fretworks depicts various Russian princes and their activities.As one would expect, the lower fretworks are quite detailed and precise compared to those on the upper level.The interior of the cathedral is rather simple as this Cathedral was built as a private chapel rather than for the public to admire the  interior."
beautiful exterior,Definitely have a walk around and view the exterior of this building. It is different from others we have seen throughout Russia. It is whitewashed inside so do not bother going in. Nearby is a lookout so you can pop by there too.
Great Council of Russia!,"Find Vladimir Sobolev easily, is in the central part of the city in a beautiful park, which is located on a hill, and there is a good view of the river. This is a unique, very old and rare for Russian cathedral! Demetrius Cathedral in Vladimir - court temple, built by Vsevolod the Big Nest in the prince's court, and was consecrated in honor of the martyr Demetrius. It was built in 1191-1197 years. Outside gorgeous moldings, inside the church no icons and paintings, it is very unusual for the Orthodox Church. Church services are not held inside - it's a museum, photography is prohibited. If you want to see the bright side of the Russian soul - this is for you!"
Along with the main attraction,There are not so much to see in Vladimir so it is most likely you are not to miss the Cathedral. Inside the cathedral is beautiful and frequently visited by the local.
