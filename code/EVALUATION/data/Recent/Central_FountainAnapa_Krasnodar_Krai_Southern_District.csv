Year round,It's even beautiful places in the winter. Very colorful and a nice place to spend a evening. No matter the season.
Not Spectacular but for Anapa nice attraction,"If you have seen similar elsewhere (e.g Emirates or Barcelona) - these are small, not spectacular and not worth visiting. However for Anapa it is a nice attraction and worthwhile to visit during your time here."
Festive summertime activity.,The musical fountains in an Anapa are really something interesting to see in the evenings. Any evening in the summer has the streets crowded with families and tourists. Stopping by the musical fountains is really a treat.
Great attraction for kids,Unexpected experience in the center of the city - especially after dark. Similar to music-fountains in Barcelona.
Very nice,If u already had been in dubai is not that great but my children just were wow!! Very impress and happy I enjoyed it because I enjoyed their reaction but if u already have seen something like that and u are not with children there is nothing special about it
Nothing special,"Maybe for Russia is a great place, but as for me - boring, small. If you've been in Emirates or Barcelona and visired musical fountains there - dobt waste your time here."
Best thing in Anapa,"After 16 day's in Anapa, we though the musical fountains, were by far the best thing there, (apart from the Dolphinarium)."
