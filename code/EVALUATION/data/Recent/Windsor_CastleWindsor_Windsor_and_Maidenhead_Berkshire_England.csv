Lively relaxed visit,Lovely relaxed walk around the castle. Staff couldn’t have been more helpful. The wedding dress was stunning
Well worth a visit,Fabulous day out.The staff were friendly and helpful.All vivid safety measures in place.Would definately visit again.
Enchanting place!,"While planning our trip to the UK, I informed my husband that I wanted to see Stonehenge and if we can squeeze it in our tight itinerary.  He said that it would be good and that he also wants to tour a castle i.e. Windsor aside from Buckingham Palace.  We were staying 5 minutes away from Buckingham and I thought that would be enough.  And so I did my research for a Stonehenge/Windsor tour.  Most of the group tours offered would take anywhere from 9 to 12 hours.  This is not an ideal vacation day for us.  So I opted for a private tour company.  Lo and behold, we found one and was able to customize our day trip outside London.  The beauty of it is that you are at the mercy of your own qualms.  We went to Stonehenge first and then stopped by Windsor on our way back to the city.  Another plus of the private tour was pre-purchased tickets for Windsor (skip the line).  This was crucial since there were busloads of tourists lined up at the ticketing area and the palace closes/stops accepting tourists at 4 p.m.  We got there around 3 and would have spent more than half an hour lining up for tickets if not for our pre-purchased tickets with the tour company.  The grounds were spectacular.  Now I understand why my husband wanted to see a castle other than Buckingham.  This one looks more of a fairy tale compared to the stately Buckingham.  The rooms/apartments are just unbelievable.  Not to mention the great hall where they put up the big Christmas tree every year.  It was so surreal to get a glimpse of how the Royals live.  Also, Windsor is one of the oldest castles that is still being used/lived in by Royals.  IT is the Queen's favorite weekend ""home"" after all.  It is also believed that Princess Diana is buried in one of the gardens here, since she is a Spencer (of Royal descent).  Just a tip though.....when you start the tour of the castle, don't get lost/spend too much time at the China room coz it can get overwhelming and there is so much more to see.......We also saved the best for last, that of being St. George's Chapel (where Prince Harry and Meghan exchanged their wedding vows).  That just put the icing on the cake for this tour.  Another plus is that my husband's name is George (so he claims it is his chapel).  After our tour, we opted to have tea (of course!) at one of the quaint cafes in the castle grounds.  If you are part of a large tour group, you prob won't  have time to do this since your time is very limited.  We also checked out the souvenir shop for the castle (mostly overpriced) but I did manage to get a few items.  It was such a lovely experience.  The palace being only an hour away from the city, this is a very manageable excursion.  Definitely must see!"
No crowds during Covid-19 ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Windsor Castle having thought about going there for many years we finally managed to arrange a trip during the Covid-19 pandemic once restrictions were lifted. We visited during the August bank holiday and it was eerily quiet which was lovely without big crowds jostling for position everywhere although not everything was open. There’s limited tickets at the moment so you must book in advance. The self guided tour was interesting covering the history of the castle and took us a couple of hours at a slow pace but we could easily have drawn it out longer. St George’s Chapel is amazing, the pictures and TV footage don’t come close to experiencing the real thing. The state apartments are fascinating with the painted ceilings and humongous art collection and antiques, it was a privilege to be able to walk around and explore (sadly taking pictures is prohibited). The castle is absolutely huge I had no idea how big it is and also hard to believe that fire destroyed the Grand Reception room back in 1992. Totally awestruck and Highly recommended."
Beautiful Castle,It was a great day walking through the castle.  There were lots of wonderful art work to view.  The audio was excellent.
Royal Castle,Book this one online but do make sure you print out the tickets before going. Pointless turning up ahead of time as they will only allow entry from the time on the ticket.Fabulous place that you see now and again on the telly. Don’t miss out on the audio tour. This can be run at your own pace and is done in lots of bitesize chunks. There is no time limit for visiting the castle.State apartments are as good as any palace. Lots of treasures to see but unfortunately photography is not allowed inside and there are lots of staff around to make sure this rule is obeyed.The East Terrace lawn is OK but nothing special.St George’s Chapel houses the tombs of numerous monarchs and is where the knights of the garter have their seats.If travelling by car don’t be tempted by parking in the closest car parks like Castle pay and display or Riverside. What a rip off. We opted for a further 5 minute walk and parked on King Edward VII car park which was half the price of the others.Windsor is a good day out and is a must when in this part of the country.
Really interesting history,This is a fantastic place to visit for anyone remotely interested in British royal history. A really good audio guide accompanies the tour and there are some great pieces from the royal collection on display.
Another wonderful Royal Palace off the bucket list.,Covid 19 made the visit even better as there were few people in the Castle. Windsor itself was quiet for the same reason. We were able to see all the things we wanted to see. The audio guide was really good and we spent over 2hrs looking at all the wonderful Royal Collection.Great value for money.
Loved the visit,We hadnt planned the visit be decidex to visit whilst passing. Staff at the front enterance were so lovely and chatty staff on reception not so. It is quite costly to entrr especially if you have children it a larger family. Recommend reducing child prices to encourage more children to visit this little bit of history. The audio devices are a little difficult to work out would advice so.eone to explain especially for children. Once we worked ut out our 7yr old grandson enjoyed the family version. The castle is unbelievable such a pleasure to go round. We thouroughly enjoyed ut.Shops were a little too costly to purchase anything.
The best castle in the uk? ,"That's the question, it's old (starting in 1070), been lived in by many monarchs, some of which are buried there and the current Queen calls it home. There are £B of artifacts on show and the audio offers interest and history in bite sized bits of information. The cake in the café is great too."
Safe and secure during these times.,"We booked online the day before as we hadn’t planned on visiting. You must have the facility to print off your booking ticket in advance.We arrived 15mins before our allotted time. A queue had already formed, but it moved quickly. Staff were on hand to help guide you, we counted at least 20 staff and this was before we had even entered the castle.As soon as you enter the castle, visit the unit that hands out free audio guides and guided tours are not happening at the moment so an audio device is a must.We encountered staff everywhere, they were all available to answer any questions. I have written many reviews, I’m a very fair reviewer, but believe me when I say, this place was VERY COVID secure at all times, staff and guides are in abundance. If your in Windsor, this place is a must. Enjoy."
Disappointing experience,"Dissapointing experience. No information provided about the castle's history - audio guides appeared to be available but these weren't offered to us and there was no written info shown on any exhibits.COVID-19 measures in the cafe were poor - people walking in and out of the same door, no table service provided (despite this being a current government requirement) and the person serving cakes wore no gloves and touched the food.Overall dissapointed with ticket and food costs."
Best holiday ever!,"I came here once with a group for mates, best decision of the night. Will be back again for more sightseeing and fun."
Excellent,"If you love history and royalty you’ll love this castle, especially the state rooms! Overall it’s a great day out."
A very interesting and engaging day for the whole family.,Both my 9 and 6 year old kids were enthralled by our day out at the castle. Social distancing meant that not all areas were open but we falt like we saw plenty.
Historically interesting,"Took my elderly mother to a visit to the castle. The staff were outstanding, helpful, understanding and very polite, nothing was too much trouble for them. Mother was in a wheelchair and we had to take different lifts to the various floors and exhibits. Everything was absolutely superb, would recommend to anyone and any age."
Very enjoyable with a lot of walking,"All of us, including two teenagers, enjoyed this visit. My teenage daughter was disappointed about not being able to see the doll house but understood the necessary restrictions in the current age. We loved the smell of roses in the garden even though it was a bit chilly! Everything was well organized to accommodate an easy flow of traffic and social distancing. We were impressed. The state apartments were beautiful and done with such lovely color schemes! We’ve visited many castles and palaces - this is one of the most tastefully decorated. Be prepared for a lot of walking. The castle is enormous!!"
A Windsor winner for us !!!!!!!!!!,Our second visit to this fantastic iconic castle situated in a lovely town....well organized throughout and guides are very friendly and helpful. We wont rule out coming here again someday as now have a complementary free year pass....
Regal splendour,What a treat to see the castle in all its regal splendour. Luxury at the highest. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend a visit. Lots of steps to climb if you struggle with walking. Covid 19 safe
Great experience,Well worth the moneyAudio headphones were brilliant Staff on hand to answer ant questions you may have
It’s OK could be better,"I love this castle one of my favourites and have been to many a exhibition. What I think is a bit much is the admission price to go round especially when there’s an exhibition on and you’re not allowed to take pictures at all. For £23.50 I would expect to be able to take some snaps, not so much of the paintings as I understand it can be detrimental to the artwork over time. However, if it’s an exhibition of say a wedding dress I’m not sure what the issue is, it’s already been photographed so many times. I think it’s a bit much that you can’t take a picture of the long walk from inside the castle. Need to make it more value for money."
A classic place to visit,"What can I say Windsor Castle is a must see place. So full of history and still lived in and used by the royal family. We had a really pleasant 3 hours slowly moving moving through the castle , walking around the garden and visiting the church we all saw at Prince Harry’s Wedding. Go now while covid is with us.  No queue even on Saturday really safe."
Great for l  as ce,I Loved visiting the royal grounds! Lovely setting but lacking in fresh cakesAnd a tea room. Will definitely visit again tho
Spectacle ,"A grand castle to visit if you're in Windsor, the walk up towards the castle is impressive and the surrounding area is beautiful. The sidestreets are filled with bustling shops and the whole area is neat and tidy. Will visit again"
Worth a visit,"We enjoyed our visit to Windsor castle. The audio guide was very good, we particularly liked the children's version, our four-year-old liked the little games in it, learning about the things we saw. We also enjoyed the mote garden, which was a nice place to relax after walking around the castle, worth paying a bit extra to see if open."
All perfect other than extortionate parking prices,Breakfast and afternoon tea were great. Would've liked a bath in our room but lovely rooms nevertheless. Would definitely stay here again
Expensive Visit,"Positives - Castle grounds were spotlessly clean and immaculately presented. Audio guide was good and we managed to follow it and I’m not very good with these things so if I can follow it anyone can. Staff friendly and very knowledgeable and plenty of them around. Negatives - so many artefacts to see but no labels or descriptions of what your looking at. And the audio guide doesn’t have it all. Queuing for the loos didn’t seem to be many. Limited access, you only see abit of the castle, not even half I’d say so quite expensive for what you get. It was Sunday so chapel wasn’t open. Tip- Don’t park in the NCP we got charged £20 for parking for the day. Worth a visit but an expensive day out."
Beautiful castle and grounds and good audio guide,"We hadn't realised the audio guide was already included with our ticket, so almost gave this a miss, but glad we realised as it was really useful and informative.There were a couple of stops we seemed to miss on the guide, not sure whether this was due to Covid restrictions or not, as most of the guide seemed to have been updated to reflect this.Beautiful castle, chapel and grounds - would definitely recommend visiting."
thoroughly enjoyable,"What an incredible place and it certainly lived up to our expectations.We will definitely be back.We can't complain about anything really, the staff were brilliant, professional and very  knowledgeable."
A worth while visit,"Lovely day spent at Windsor Castle. Excellent precautions in place and helpful  friendly Staff.The castle was fairly quiet due to no foreign visitors, so if you get the chance to go at this time then its well worth the visit."
Disappointing experience,"We bought our tickets beforehand and got straight in.  It was very quiet generally and there was a one way system in place due to Covid.  We thought signage was generally poor and when we got almost to the end we found that we'd missed quite a lot of things that we couldn't access without rejoining the queue to get in the castle building.  There wasn't that much written information about some of the history/artefacts. The audio system didn't always match the room that we were in and at least one room was completely missed off the audio.  As it was Sunday, the chapel was closed.  An expensive visit for the experience."
An enjoyable experience,Despite covid restrictions it was still a good day i like the art and history my wife was touched when we saw the resting place of the Queen Mother and her father. Would recommend.
East wing,"We live in Windsor so we went there in order to see the East Garden, which was designed by Prince Philip, with help from the Queen.  It's very nice.  As we live in Windsor we went there simply to see the garden which is ONLY open this month.  It's worth visit ."
Disappointing,"We cannot fault how beautiful the chapel and castle is, especially as we came on a glorious sunny day, but we walked away feeling really disappointed. The audio system wasn't clear at all so we found ourselves walking about aimlessly trying to figure out what we were listening to and although some of the staff were helpful I felt the £47 we spent on the tickets would have been better spent. Fortunately we bought a Windsor guide at £4.95 at the start. I learnt more from that then the tour itself. This could all be due to post COVID times. Hopefully we will return in the future and the audio system and guidance has improved."
Great experience but I would buy tickets direct or on the day.,"It is a great 2-3 hour tour of the castle with some amazing rooms and spectacular views from the Castle. I would recommenced a visit but would book direct through the castle or buy on the day. We went on a Sunday and the Chapel was closed so wanted to revisit the following day. If we had bought a ticket on the day or direct they would have given a stamp, meaning we could return anytime in the year; however as we had bought via a third party (trip advisor) we were not eligible for this stamp. There was no change in the price we would have paid but missed a benefit we could would have received. Not sure it TA are aware of this and if there is anything that can be done but think it’s worth noting for anyone who is looking to book a ticket to visit."
Beautiful Windsor Castle,A lovely day at Windsor castle visiting the state rooms and the breathtaking St George’s chapel. Stunning and a piece of history. Worth the trip.
Great place to see,"I had wanted to visit Windsor Castle for many years and I was not disappointed, what a great place to see!the staff are very organised and  there were plenty to keep an eye on the queues and people social distancing properly. even though it was busy, it felt safe. all the staff were very friendly.make sure to visit on any day but Sunday as the chapel is closed. (we had checked before and went on a Thursday) as the chapel is definitely one of the highlights (its where Henry VIII is buried after all) for all history fans, its a must.the only downer is that you can't take pictures inside.definitely recommended. Windsor itself is also very pretty to spend the rest of the day after the visit. I would advise to go early as then there is less queue inside to see the royal apartments, go at 10, 10.30"
Truly fascinating!,"What a delight! Windsor Castle is well worth a visit. The grounds are extensive and, as you can imagine, immaculately maintained. Entry includes use of small media devices which provide a full commentary during the tour, which you can take at your leisure. Tickets are fairly reasonable (£23.50 for a standard adult, £21.20 for over 60s and I think there's a family rate (sorry didn't note the cost of that). We bought a very well-produced/illustrated guide for £4.99 which was well worth it. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take pictures inside the castle but there is so much to see, so much history to consume. St Georges Chapel (where Harry & Meghan married) is so beautiful, truly enchanting (even if you're not religious)! Definitely well worth a few hours to wander aroung and there's a lovely cafe where you can purchase reasonably-priced, tasty food. We took the renowned 'Long Walk' which leads from the castle to a (small|) hillside statue of George III (on horseback) and were delighted to see deer roaming freely. A great day out."
well worth the visit,"Well worth a visit if your in Windsor,fascinating history and full of fabulous history. Sometimes a small wait to move around,staff ver helpful."
"Castle good, Cafe bad","The long wait ( 35 minutes ) for our timed admission was only to be expected just glad not to be visiting when they have the normal crowds. The Castle staff staff were without exception very helpful at all times and so nice to see such smart uniforms, it all takes far longer to go round than you might realise and yes there is another long queue once inside the grounds. Some tourists clearly thought that they would be seeing the Royal living quarters instead of just the state rooms, I very much liked the display of gifts presented to the Royals on various foreign tours. Some good displays of armour and weapons. Covid regulations were strictly followed except in the Cafe which I gather is a concession. Here apart from one young lady thoroughly cleaning all tables and chairs as soon as vacated no-one else was ensuring that social distancing was kept especially in the very long and very slow queue to choose and pay for food. The selection was dire and all short dated mainly for that day, the sandwiches were dried out and the bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese was dreadful, very stale and the cream cheese was a mere film certainly not the 15% content it was supposed to be. No taking of name and contact number - why not all other tourist places are ?Castle 9/10, Cafe 4/10"
Wonderful experience,Wonderful experience really worth the visit and great value for money! Even more enjoyable now that there are not that many tourists!
A must for all travellers  to London and area,Inside Windsor castle magnificent . A must is the audio guide It’s very informative and interesting. You are not allowed to take photos inside but no problem in the grounds. The staff were helpful and informative
Windsor Castle ,"Decided to do a weekend trip to Windsor. Very luckily, the Windsor Castle opened up to visitors that week and we were extremely fortunate to visit the castle with very limited crowds. Our tour guide, Amanda (strongly recommended) gave us all the interesting details regarding this fascinating castle..the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world today. Spread across numerous acres this massive castle and the St George's Chapel are an absolute must do if you are visiting Windsor. The Queen happened to be there during our visit..you know she's there by the flag. The richness of everything within and outside the castle is breathtaking. Make sure you plan a good 2 to 3 hours to take a good look. Everyone was super friendly and they glad to have visitors coming back after a prolonged period of lockdown."
Windsor Castle a nice family day out ,"We decided to go to the Windsor castle, on arrival we waited to get our tickets, once inside we had to sanitise our hands and every thing was social distancing. We went through a security check. Once in to the castle you can purchase for free ear phones that tell you every thing about the history of the castle as you walk around. My eldest who’s 14 and my 9Year old loved it."
Pre booked ,Pre booked for 10:30. Huge amount of people waiting in line that had also pre booked. Took around 25 mins to get in.Beautiful day and castles and grounds are lovely.We will return when Covid is over to see the get the full experience.We had our tickets stamped and now have an annual pass. Very good and worth a visit.
"Stunning castle,",Hadn’t visited castle for about 50+ years so  took advantage on a recent trip to Windsor. St Gearges chapel is beautiful as are the state apartments visited. Unbelievable the restoration work to the areas that suffered such terrible damage in the fire of 1992. The furniture and collections shown are wonderful and the stewards are only too pleased to help. Amazing!
Great morning out,"Lovely visit to the castle.  Very hot on being Covid secure.  Lots of wonderful artefacts and architecture to admire.  Enjoyed a delicious cake from the cafe too.  Vast majority of the staff were fantastic - one was an idiot and unkind to a small child who forgot not to be touching things, the member of staff could have been much kinder about in dealing with this."
Amazing!!,Wow!! absolutely gorgeous!!Was amazed by the castle. So beautiful and well kept...the staff were all so lovely! Very welcoming. Answered all your questions with a smile. If they saw you looking and something and could tell you were curious about what it was. they would come up and tell you about it. Seriously recommend going. You won’t be disappointed.
Worth the money,"It was really well organised, particularly given Covid. The tour was easy to follow and with the audio book included it was interesting. I felt the audiobooks was really good as lots of short snippets of about a minute. There are so many interesting parts. There are some areas where you would like to know more than the audio guide offers but the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Also you can look on the royal collection website. Would recommend for a good way to spend a morning or afternoon."
Fab Trip for a family,"You had to queue a little on entry and in particular rooms, but given the current pandemic, this was fine and never took to long.We had our 8 year old daughter with us, and although we were worried she might not enjoy it, she loved it. We had the audio to listen to on the way around, and she was very happy listening and taking part in the games on the screen. She learnt a lot on the way around, and was full of useful little facts on our journey home. Lovely to visit and walk around, for all ages."
Iconic visit,"A must see and an awesome castle and grounds. The whole family loved the experience and great picture opportunities, shame you can’t take a picture of the jewels etc, however, this is standard.Staff were really friendly and helpful too. A really great experience."
Fantastic Trip,"What a fantastic place to visit, staff very friendly and knowledgable. By far the best of the Queens palaces"
Lovely castle,"Excellent day out with friendly helpful staff, really clean everywhere and the tea and cake in the cafe was superb."
Great access,Amazing access. Booked two admissions tickets to visit Windsor Castle. These were then able to be converted into an annual pass. So made the ticket great value. Due to Covid protocols guided tours are currently unavailable however you can get personal audio device tour that is cleaned after each use. Was very surprised at the access in which the general admissions ticket gave. Being able to walk around the grounds of Windsor castle to see the architecture of the building. The intricate brickwork of all the buildings. Touring the state apartments to see the decor and furniture it’s truly an incredible sight to see. If you’re ever looking for a day out a trip to Windsor castle would be highly recommend.
Priced to have only middle class visitors ,"I visited in Aug 20 and although the castle is worth seeing the prices charged are extortionate and will prevent many people from attending, and the rip off doesn’t end there - 2 tea and a coffee with 2 pieces of cake £22.  It’s not wonder there owner is the richest woman in the world.  Having travelled extensively across Europe and the states it’s a shame that in the UK prices are so expensive they prevent a sizeable proportion of the population from attending."
Beautiful castle but surprisingly busy for Covid times,"Of course the castle is beautiful but I was taken aback by how busy it was.  Not having visited before I thought this would be a good time to go because of the timed entrance tickets and 'limited' visitor numbers, I expected it to be much quieter because of Covid measures.  The staff were certainly encouraging social distancing and there was plenty of signage to remind people, and sanitising points, but in a number of places it did not feel 'Covid safe'.  Particularly in some of the rooms in the state apartments and in the circulation corridors it was very crowded at times and social distancing was not happening.  I think visitor numbers need to be significantly reduced to keep visitors safe.We were fortunate to see the East Terrace garden which was lovely."
Really friendly staff,"With a lively 2 1/2 year old it is always quite daunting when visiting places like this. But the staff were so friendly, helpful and considerate and actually made the visit all the better. Our daughter thought every room was a ‘party’ room and continued to sing and dance her way around the castle, probably like any princess should. Great big thank you to the staff you have working"
Castle tour ,Loved the tour of the castle just sorry we missed the dolls house but we now have a pass for a year so will definitely be returning to see that and the park.  St George's chapel surrounded by history and proud to have such amazing heritage.
Opulence at its best,"The Queen lives here, so does Phil her hubby.It’s big and lavish and although we pay for its upkeep via our taxes we also pay to go in.Keep your tickets as you get asked for them several times once inside.As Covid-19 SD is in place you have hand gel in most places. The rooms are lavish and it’s another world away from most of us. No photography is allowed. Buy a tour guide.Use the audio headset to walk around with.Lots of titbits.The recent restoration work is good. Didn’t find these guys on Checkatrade.com!St George’s chapel was interesting with loads of people we don’t know buried there."
Definitely recommend ,"Great visit, well laid out, helpful staff, audio provided.  Nice cafe but pricey at 2.50 for a can of pop."
Majestic ...,"While security is tight, entry was well managed and done in a Covid secure way. Up close the castle is a beautiful structure and we felt special to be walking in its grounds. The east terrace gives spectacular views over the surrounding town and countryside. The state apartments house beautiful historic artefacts with good information boards. It was nice to see the magnificent state rooms all restored following the fire. You catch a glimpse through the window of the Royals' private apartments on the other side of the inner court yard. The wood carvings in St George’s chapel are truly exquisite and the centuries of history scream out at you as you wonder past tombs of past Kings and Queens.A must visit attraction ... which you can visit as many times as you like in 12 months for the one entry fee."
History up close,"Here history becomes visible and tangible. A visit to the castle is a great experience for the whole family. There is something to discover for everyone. The crowd is well distributed throughout the grounds. I recommend the guided tour with headphones and if you have time, you should definitely stroll through the village and walk the long walk back to the castle. From there you also have the best perspective for photos.Too bad that you were not allowed to take photos"
Amazing place,"Absolutely fabulous place, we spent a few hours to visit the castle. Ticket is valid for one year, so we will back again. Stunning place. Highly recommended."
Fascinating!,"Loved our visit to the Castle, definitely get the audio guide and take your time.  Our 10 year old daughter loved it as much as us, steeped in history and very well run."
Disappointing - not enough to see!,"Disappointing! Not a great deal to see. No grounds to wander around unless you pay extra to visit the moat garden.Not a great deal to see inside the castle. Once you have seen one display or swords, pikes and muskets you will see many more similar displays. We saw the sign for the Billiards room and thought ""at last, something different to see"", but no, it's yet another shop with overpriced corgi dog toys!Compared to Buck Palace, Hampton Court Palace etc. this comes way down the list."
Very interesting and informative,"Definitely take the multi-media player option at the start - it's included in the ticket price and provides lots of information as you go around the castle. Large queue to enter even with a timed ticket booked in advance. Don't forget to get your ticket stamped if you want to return within a year, I'm hoping to go back once the Dolls House is open again."
The castles Xtra magical ingredient was its caring attentive staff.,The castles magnifiscents to one side for me as a boot scooter using disabled visitor the castles xtra magical ingredient was its caring attentive staff. I say this without exception. Their kindness and help enabled me to feel fully included along with the other visitors.Although having visited many places I have never experienced that feeling of total inclusion as I did on my visit to H.M favourite home.I am so grateful for their kindness that easily outshone all of the Castles contentsThank you one and all
Queens Private Garden open for the first time in 40 years. Worth a visit.,"Covid has changed everything about visits to Historical Buildings. Booked in advance. Had to wear mask inside State Rooms, and I cant wear masks for too long so couldn't spend much time admiring all the antiquities. Best was the Queens Private Garden is open for the 1st time in 40 years, what a treat to see her Backyard. Dolls House is closed due to Covid. St Georges Chapel is also closed on Sundays due to Services.. I parked very close to the Castle but could only park for 3 hours, so again I had to rush through in case I got a parking penalty. A staff told me to park further down the river where there is all day parking. My ticket was £21.20 for over 60s but can visit again so hoping to go back once within the year, on a weekday when its quiet so I can take in all the grandeur and visit St Georges Chapel.  Love all the Quaint shops outside the Castle."
A must visit.,"We have just been to Windsor to visit the castle for my wife's birthday and I have to say it was brilliant. The rooms are magnificent and the gardens lovely, but when you see the rooms that have been restored after the fire in 1992, which we could not believe was so long ago, you realise just how good that restoration is. All the staff were nice, friendly and informative and more sanitiser stations than we've ever seen anywhere. You are required to wear a mask inside any rooms but outside it is your own personal choice. Numbers are limited so at no time did we feel we could not keep our social distance and enjoy the experience. A must visit for anyone I would say."
Class!!!,"What can you say that hasn't already been said? Absolutely top drawer few hours, the history, character and beauty of the place is incredible. Highly recommend!"
A nice visit,We enjoyed our visit but as access to some areas was not permitted perhaps this should have been reflected in a reduced price.
Enjoyable visit to Windsor Castle,"Despite the COVID-19 restrictions we had an enjoyable visit and tour of Windsor Castle. There was a limited.number of people allowed into the site and this made it pleasantly quiet but the downside was that not all rooms or gardens were open to the public. However, we were able to convert our tickets to allow free re-admission within 12 months which was a nice touch. The views from the castle were great and we were able to tour the state rooms and St George’s Chapel."
Very impressive ,"Great visit to this historic castle, informative audio guide and friendly staff, worth the entrance money for the couple of hours we spent in side. St George’s chapel especially impressive!"
A great place,We visited Windsor Castle and had booked our tickets for 11am. There was a queue to get in but we were through the checking in and security by 11:02 - excellent and speedy service. It was relatively quiet due to the limited number of guests they were allowing in (which was great for us but obviously not so great for the Castle) A very well organised system which meant we felt safe all the time. The only times we had to queue was at the state apartments and then again for the cafe but this was well managed (and expected) We spent a total of 4 hours there and made use of the free audio guide (although I had to change mine twice at the start as there were faulty connections) - we were reassured that the headphones had been sanitised before and after use (but you could also use your own if you wanted to) they appeared very clean so we used theirs.I think it is good value for money (£23.50 each for adults) No idea how busy it would be at full capacity (I think they are running at approximately a third of their normal visitors Thankyou for a lovely day (the weather helped)
Amazing day out,"Windsor Castle is a total credit to the UK, it is an amazing landmark that has been exceptionally preserved and cherished and is fantastic to see.  The staff are all very helpful and knowledgeable, the gardens beautiful and the actual castle and all of its contents are wonderful to see.  We visited early August when, due to the Virus, visitor numbers were still restricted but this was to our favour as the venue was not busy or over crowded and we were able to walk around the gardens and buildings comfortably.  Will definitely go again when we are back in Windsor."
Outstanding value for a family visit,Took the family to visit the castle for the first time and spent over 4 hours there which flew by very quickly. Would recommend the virtual tour as the detail it provides is fascinating. A true piece of history and well worth a visit especially as you can get your ticket validated which allows you to return again within the next 12 months
Just a walk round the outside.  ,"We had just come from our trip to Legoland ( see review ) and decided to take a walk round Windsor and the castle,  we only spent an hour , wandering around,  but I have to say it was a beautiful part of London Area,  and could imagine its full of life on the night time.  And the castle looks Amazing.  I think MADGE WAS IN TO.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧"
good day out,Had to book slotted time so low number of people was very comfortable.staff very helpful wanted to see the East Terrace Garden which was lovey but the heavy rain had been hard on  the  roses  all in all a good day out
"Stunning day in absolute beatiful grounds, buildings and rooms.","What a beatiful buildings and rooms. On  a warm day to wander around the cool rooms of the castle and areas in St Georges Chapel it was astounding the beauty the colours and historical facts, pagentry and heraldic flags and banners. This blotted out the sounds of ever present jet engine noise over head. To stroll around the ground seen untold time on TV, was an experence I will not forget. Although because of restrcitions areas were closed off, face masks to be worn indoors. It did not spoil the visit."
One wasnt home disappointed ,Though  the palace  was interesting I am a closet royalist  but expect  better attendance from one's  queen but seriously  a good place
Beautiful,What a beautiful place to come and spend a few hours. So much history and imagination runs wild while walking around. The gardens are unreal and the great hall and chapel are breathtaking.
EAST  TERRACE GARDEN OK BUT EXPECTED MORE,"Having seen the fact that as part of admissions on Sat & Sun at the moment, one can also access tbe East Terrace Garden which has not been open to the public for 40yrs. We thought it would be full of colour and vibrancy. Whilst pleasant it is primarily 4 beds of roses and a central fountain. You do get a view of the East end of the Royal Apartments and get a slight look at ghe pool and gym the Royala use located in tbe old Orangery. Was expecting more."
Great place to visit ,"Pre booked tickets, aim to arrive 15 mins before the time you book, doesn’t take long to get in what with all the social distancing etc.Staff are friendly and helpful,and there’s plenty of them if you have questions etc.We stayed for around 2 hours ish, but there isn’t any time limit.Some really interesting things to see, overall a very happy visit and definitely worth going if your in or around the area."
Brilliant afternoon out,We (family of 3) really enjoyed the Windsor Castle experience. Everything was socially distanced really well lots of sanitiser stations and no encroachment from other visitors. Lots of staff on hand to give advice on both the building and rooms and keep an eye on the social distancing. Rose gardens are absolutely beautiful and the the artefacts from around the world & commonwealth our 8yr old  found fascinating. With limited numbers it works really well.What a beautiful place to visit. Highly recommend.
Great Excurson from Heathrow,"If you can schedule one or two nights layover at Heathrow, head for Windsor.  Wonderful ambiance of town and environment, fascinating castle history, and much more relaxed setting than London. Second only to Buckingham Palace for the royals."
Local treat,"I had not been here since the fire so great to see the restoration. Timed ticket entry under Covid rules means not so busy so you can get to see everything. Visited on one of the hottest days of the year and still good. Though £2.50 for a small can of water a rip off. Some new bits to see including the Ceremonial entrance and Queens garden. Easy to park at close by Alma Road car park, never seen it so empty during the week. Upgraded tickets for free for another visit in the year as gift aided them. Multimedia player a must and included in price of ticket."
Walking in Her Majesty's Footsteps!,"The booking procedure for tickets and entry times was a smooth process, we found no difficulties in getting the day and time of our choice. The organisation of the entry queue was fine; the attendant only allowed guests to join the queue for their allotted entry time. Early arrivals were asked to wait or come back at their exact pre-booked time. The entry formalities were thorough with bags being scanned by airport-style scanners and there were scanning arches for the guests to walk through. Once inside the castle grounds, the buildings were magnificent. There is an option for an audio guide tour but we decided to wander around under our own steam which was just as easy but we obviously didn't have the running commentary. St George's Chapel was open to the public on our visit but lots of the interior was roped off and access not available. Unfortunately, the visit inside was not enjoyable due to having to wear a face covering which restricted my vision- wearing glasses and masks do not go well together, I was continually steaming up|! This is no fault of the Castle or their staff but it does detract from the enjoyment. This was also the case in the State Apartments, which although very lovely and interesting to see, much of it was seen through steamed up glasses. The grounds and castle gardens were impressive, especially The Duke of Edinburgh's Rose Garden on the East Terrace, well worth a stroll even in 95 degree temperatures!! The gift shops were well stocked but overly priced. The average tourist on holiday would not really want to pay £250 for a teapot. The was a good selection of Royal souvenirs, books, bookmarks, postcards, all the usual items. The cafe provided a good selection of snacks and beverages although once again at slightly inflated prices - £2.50 for a can of coke is a bit steep. They would sell more if they reduced their prices possibly."
Scenic day out,"We visited Windsor Castle on the 6th August, as almost required viewing for our Windsor trip! And it was definitely worth it.Although not as much as we hoped was open -  the gardens and Dolls House are unfortunately yet to open - we had great fun experiencing the grounds and staterooms. The latter is particularly beautiful, although unfortunately no photos were allowed.The views from atop the castle are equally as stunning - you can see all around Windsor - and it was so empty and distanced we almost felt as though we had the place to ourselves.We will definitely be utilising the free option to upgrade and visit for as long as we want all year, when the gardens and other rooms eventually open."
Great Visit! ,"We had such a great time learning about the castle, grounds and the royals. Highly recommend a visit"
Great ,"Great visit to the castle, first time there. Well organised. The tour is mainly outside which was great and you can go at your own pace. The audio tour is useful to guide you around the castle. Disappointing you can't take pictures inside but I get it."
The best tourist attraction in the world.,"Seeing the completed restoration of the rooms where the fired started, amazing craftmanship. Staff were courteous and very professional."
Windsor Castle,"Despite being concerned over post lockdown restrictions, today’s visit to Windsor Castle was very good. Well organised and lots to see, the headsets were very informative and staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. Reduced number of tourists actually made for a better experience."
First week after lockdown re-opening,I'd booked admission tickets to Windsor Castle which only re-opened to the public this week (after Covid lockdown). Entrance was well organised into time slots to limit numbers to ensure social distancing. It was very pleasant strolling around the grounds which seemed peaceful without the usual hoards of foreign tourists. Windsor Castle is the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world. Visiting the Castle gave a glimpse into the rich heritage of the British Monarchy: it brought history to life for me.
interesting but best part is closed to public,"unfortunately very small part of castle is open to public,  in 1 hr max visit is ended since no much to see, internal garden closed to public, Doll house closed, Queen wing closed, and many other part of castle like are closed to public, you can see only few rooms above state apartments no much. Best part is the chapel but doesn’t belong to the Queen."
Must See Windsor Castle,Really great visit to one of the worlds greatest Castles. Shame about the weather but it didn’t stop us enjoying the wonderful sights and historical artefacts on show.Would highly recommend a visit
We didn’t see the Queen but we did see the changing of the guard,"We toured Windsor Castle as part of a group day tour hitting three tourist sites (Stonehenge, Bath, and Windsor) in one day. Windsor was the last stop and, although we didn’t get to stay as long as we would have liked, we certainly enjoyed our visit. Visiting all three sites made for a long day and a lot of time riding on the tour bus. Windsor Castle, a working royal palace for over 900 years, is the largest occupied fortress castle in the world. The Queen uses the castle both as a private home, where she sometimes spends the weekend and as an official royal residence where she performs certain royal duties. Parts of the castle are open for the public to tour. Lots of history and significance. (PaM)"
Windsor Castle ,Visited Windsor Castle for a business trip. What a lovely day for a visit. Every member of staff are so welcoming. Ticket brought in advance and got my ticket for a one year pass. Well worth it. Lucky to see the King's Royal Hussars changing of the guard. I would recommend for a first time visitor to Windsor Castle have a recorded guide tour. It will give you alot of history in each section. Then you should walk to long walk. I would recommend getting there early as its limited numbers at present. Worth a second visit.Thank you to all the staff. Photo of King's Royal Hussars passing St. George's Chapel. Photographer and Travel journalist:- Mark Leishman
My Birthday in quarentine,"Despite the pandemic, it was worth the external visit, beautiful!  Pubs with wonderful views of the castle, I will definitely return to visit inside the castle.  Passionate place"
Don’t buy tickets from Trip Advisor,"Due to COVID-19, the castle was closed, but tripadvisor still sold tickets that turned out not to be useable. We have not received a refund yet."
"Get there early before huge queues, buy ticket in advance","Booked in advance, arrived early so walked straight in- huge queues on the way out. The castle is actually much smaller than it seems on tv, tried to watch changing of the guard but people were so rude, climbing and standing on park benches with dirty boots, and shoving in front of you so couldn't really see a thing!When you get in there are multiple ways to go to the different bits, which are a bit confusing and not very well signposted. Grounds are kept beautifully and there was a band playing when we visited which was nice.Staff are very helpful though, which is good as we had to ask for directions and made sure we hadn't missed anything. Lots of overpriced gift shops as per usual with Royal residences. St George's Chapel is lovely, but pretty crowded so you have to keep moving. Don't go on a Sunday as this is closed to the public. Pretty crowded inside the castle but plenty to see and lots of info on the audio tour. Took less time for the visit than expected, didn't go in the extra garden as this had a queue and it was more money I think."
Great historical site,I've been here more than once and i'm never disappointed by how interesting it is to learn the history and to be surrounded by such an awesome and beautiful castle. We spent hours soaking everything in and thoroughly enjoyed the outside gardens too.
Expensive and not fun,"While there are loads of things to see there is nothing to actually do, it was over crowded and lost its charm in the process, dolls house had an hour queue so gave that a miss."
Amazing - Must do!,All I can say is WOW. Such amazing grounds before you enter and see soooo much history and beauty of all the fine things. The grandeur of the rooms are breathtaking. You absolutely must visit!
Amazing history,Disappointing that photography not permitted inside castle but is allowed in grounds. but a wonderful experince to see. Lovely little souviner shops avilable in around castle with some really gorgeous exclusive giftware as well as small more affordable items.
Interesting collections,"There were several interesting rooms and collections. I would not return, but there’s lots to see and do."
no photos inside,we were fortunate to go when tourism was down(right before everything shut down due to covid-19).  we practically had the castle to ourselves.  definitely worth the visit....pretty amazing.
A wonder experience,"It was a wonderful experience, a lot of walk so if you're going with young children be warned. It's a lot of walking to see the state apartments and St George's Castle."
Beautiful place,"The Castle is just beautiful. You can see and learn so many things about the Royal family and this is just great. I've enjoyed a beautiful day walking through the whole accessible parts of the Castle, of course and I would definitely repeat the experience."
Easy day trip from London,"It is costly, but you do get a lot for the money. There is an included guided tour, changing of the guard (not as grand as Buckingham, but good), doll house, state apartments, and the grand St. George's Chapel."
WOW,"Loved it!!!It is exactly what I imagined a castle would look like as a little girl. Fortress, lovely architecture, beautiful lush green grass quadrangle. The interior is grand is grand and exactly what you expect in a castle. We saw a great deal of rooms, a lot more than other castles in Europe and you can move at your own pace. St George's is exquisite. Even though it is huge the two sections being separate it feels intimate. If you have time I would suggest using the audio guides. The castle just feels enchanting and welcoming, I can see why the queen feels most at home here."
Well it is a Castle,"Make sure you have lots of time to browse around, great to walk around and see all there is to see, then afterwards walk around the town."
"Nice Castle, but pick your visit time","We had tickets in advance, but in March and with the COVID-19 scare beginning in the UK it was very quiet and there were no lines at all. The castle and grounds themselves are quite nice, but we arrived at about 3 PM and found that many of the locations you can visit on the grounds were either closing or were closing at 4 PM so we had to rush to see as much as we could. Too bad you cannot take photos in the apartments or Queen Ann's Dollhouse area as they were spectacular. The majority of the staff and security were very polite and helpful, but our experience was soured by one woman who after we were told to put our cameras away before entering the apartments continued to hound my daughter who was holding my GoPro for me while I carefully was putting away my SLR in the protective bag. With little crowds, she could have shown a little patience."
Great experience,"Decided to visit the castle a couple of weekends ago when we visited Windsor for the day and noticed no queues for the castle. Fascinating history, brilliant staff, beautiful decor and furnishings - and you could easily spend many hours here. The chapel is also amazing, and you can have a quick look or spend many hours there too! I’ll be going back!"
Christmas Gift,"Went as we had been given tickets for Christmas. Loved every minute, added to as hardly anyone there re the Virus. The castle is great but pick your time as different rooms are open depending on the Owners usage lol. Audio guide is good once you get use to it."
A must see while here,Our group only had time to do a out side walking Tour but I am going back for the full tour in the near future what a beautiful are in the city
Fabulous,"This is well worth a visit with plenty to see  the history is brilliant, not at all religious but found St Georges chapel quite moving. Also it was great to know that Her Majesty was in residence whilst we were there. Nice stop for cake and coffee in the cellar"
Well worth Visiting,"Can not fault  the Staff and well worth visiting, would 100% go again was not to busy when we visited but would say in summer would be busy"
Nice option for a day trip from London,"This is one of the residences of the royal family.  From central London, it’s only about an hour away by train (our route was from Paddington to Slough to Windsor & Eton Central), and the from the station in Windsor it’s only a minute or two to the castle grounds.  The ticket allows entrance to the grounds, and from there you can visit the castle and St. George’s Chapel.  There are several “routes” through the castle, but probably the most impressive is the “ceremonial” route, where the queen receives visitors and performs states functions.  The other routes highlight rooms built by Charles II and George IV.  The chapel is a beautiful church filled with royal tombs, artwork, and other items relating to the monarchy.  Photography was not allowed in any of the interior spaces, but we did receive an audio guide that was very well done.  You can also walk around and explore the grounds.  The castle is elevated over the town, so there are nice views of the surrounding area.  You can also peek at the green spaces of the upper and middle wards.  On the western side of the grounds is the Horseshoe Cloister, which is lined with pretty houses where the staff live.  There were no issues with taking exterior photographs.Our trip here took up most of the day.  It was all rather busy, but that’s to be expected from a major site, and fortunately the crowds were not suffocating.  After visiting the castle, we explored the surrounding neighborhood.  (N.B. The Windsor and Royal Borough Museum has toilets outside the building.)  We then walked north and crossed the river to visit Eton College, less than a 20 minute walk from the castle grounds.Highly recommended."
Amazing,I have never been before but I was very impressed. Made me think about our heritage. It was wonderful to see. A stark contrast to the people sleeping on the streets outside though. One extreme to the other.
Fabulous,"Spent a wonderful day Castle, the state rooms are magnificent and have to be seen to believed. The Chapel although smaller than I expected was beautiful. Thoroughly recommend a visit. If the weather is good then the Great Park is also a must."
Amazing Castle,Took our mum for an early mother's day treat to Windsor Castle & we all loved the castle - so much history. Beautiful state apartments & Queen Mary's doll house amazing. The feel of the castles royals past & present made it so special
Royal History,"Had a great visit, so much history and it’s a stunning place to walk around for 3-4 hours.We arrived at 10.30am (on a Saturday) and got straight in, the guides are very friendly and helpful and know there stuff.Overall highly recommended."
"It's Windsor Castle, baby!","Just fabulous, all the history, but still a living palace with more history made every year. Visit off peak as it can be mad-busy."
Well worth seeing,"I didn't realize that I needed to go to Windsor, (it was scheduled by my son), I'm so glad he did. A wonderful day we even got a close up view of the Queen, (thanks to our driver/tour guide Bill Berry from London Black cab tours).Book in advance and thanks to Bill we were able to pass a line of hundreds of people, he knew when and where to take us to get a front row view of the Queen. It was a fantastic day."
March visit,"Chose a day with changing of the guard, was very chilly but worth it. The castle itself is well laid out for all visitors with a  bit for everyone. We went early spring during term time so it was relatively quiet can imagine it being really busy during holidays.Well worth the visit."
Day trip,Windsor was lovely. Lots of history and the castle was amazing. Easy to go round and listen to the tour through headphones. Very enjoyable day out.
Always a favourite,"Windsor Castle and the grounds make for a wonderful day out.  Windsor itself is a lovely little town, with the castle at its centre.    The admission can be for the grounds or the grounds and castle.  For those who have never been to the castle before it is a must to see the royal apartments and tour inside the castle.  Make it a whole day trip to really see everything without being rushed."
Great lunch,Ate in the lower restaurant - French Village- lovely food. Chowder full of fish and seafood. Prawn open sandwich also delicious.
Windsor Castle,Loved Windsor and the castle. The audio aids brought the experience to life. Entrance fee very reasonable.
Loved the travel gift room!,"First time I've ever been to Windsor Castle, and I've lived in England for over 30 years. Didn't disappoint though. Had a great day exploring the rooms and learning more about what went on there through the audio guide. Shame some of the staff were so short with us (verging on rude) but others made up for it by being lovely. Also, will definitely be better when you can get lunch and coffee. We only left because we were hungry. My favourite room was the one with all the travel gifts in. Great day!"
Fantastic,"What an experience & stunning place to visit. Even got a quick glimpse at the Queen leaving to go to Buckingham Palace.Staff were very knowledgeable, helpful & friendly at all times.Audio equipment was ideal to use going round"
Lovely family day out,"We loved Windsor Castle, the audio going was very useful and kept the children entertained and involved in its history. The only downside was we went on a Sunday and the Chapel was closed so was unable to go in, which we would have liked to have done."
** Very expensive **,"**EXPENSIVE ENTRY**Not worth the price i think, not much to see, a few rooms with some furniture and pictures when half the castle was NOT accessible and entry was limited within complex as you just walk past most rooms out of bounds..Cannot take pictures of your visit there, so just a few were taken outside..Windsor is nice, worth visiting the area and wondering around nearby..The main Windsor castle website was not working when i tried to book tickets, just wasnt taking my payment from any cards..so I had to book using another site but these sites DO NOT alllow access to castle again for 12mths..only their main website allows this, but i had to book urgently so...bummed 🙄WARWICK CASTLE IS MUCH BETTER !!..more to see and do..free to take pictures/video and very life like 👌🏼"
Must see,"Have not been since I was a small child, recently on a “trip home” in England and my German girlfriend had always dreamed of visiting the castle. The whole castle is well laid out with lots to see and included a free audio guide which stupidly we declined and I regret that as I saw other people using them and it looked liked you could select the info you wanted to hear not just a boring rambling tape like some other places. Would highly recommend this, jus a shame all the local car parks charge silly prices for parking which makes it an expensive day out! But no photos allowed to be taken inside which is a shame but not the end of the world!"
Well organised at every stage,Worth a trip went at a quote time so much history to view - the China porcelain was the best - how people could live like this - definitely got the brain going
Amazing,"A wonderful example of English Heritage, left me spell bound and speechless at the magnificent collections of paintings, china and furniture."
Weather dreadful but a truly fantastic day,"Our Daughter and her Husband took us to Windsor Castle and the weather did not spoil  it. We were able to parkIn River Street carpark which is so convenient for the Castle. There is a short uphill walk as one would expect to reach the Castle. Once inside and after being security checked. We were free to wander st our will and directions  were excellent. We opted to use the personal Audio Unit which was very helpful. On  occasions outside viewing was necessary but once in the  State Appartments there was so much to see all inside. The rooms are truly magnificent and of course one of the highlights was the Queens Dolls House designed by Edward Luttyens, truly wonderful. The guides and in fact the whole staff were so helpful thus making the visit even more enjoyable.  Thank you to all concerned. To complete our visit we were taken to the Castle Hotel just a few steps away for a delicious afternoon tea.   The end of  a perfect day."
One of the best castle and a must visit on a trip to bath/bristol,"Windsor castle is one of the beautiful castle and a must visit on your trip. It is on the way to bath and there are lot of day trip options available. Doll house, the long view of the garden from the entry point of the state apartment, interiors of each and every room in state apartment is so beautiful. If you get your ticket stamped, you can visit them for free for the next 12 months."
Absolutely FABULOUS look at English history!,"My family and I spent a day in Windsor, and we started with a tour around the castle. It was awesome that the castle practically touches the train station, so you are introduced to it before you even step foot in the city. It is so huge and impressive, and the fact that you can see such a good amount of the inside of the castle was a highlight. It is like a museum with works of art everywhere you look. They also provide headsets with your admission which gives you so much more additional information as you go through the castle grounds. We went on a Sunday, which meant that you were not able to go into St. George's Cathedral unless you wanted to attend a service, but it was impressive from the outside nonetheless. However, the crowds were also quite minimal, which meant that it was easy to see everything, we could take our time and not be in others' way, and it was so worth it to meander through and (try to) take it all in. Without a doubt, one of my favorite experiences on our trip (and I had many)!"
great day,we were there over 3 hours and did not get to see everything.Our 10 year old granddaughter loved it as well especially the interactive audio device
History and royalty,"Pre booked through ticket agency. Cost is around £21-23 per adult. There is a parade from the Guards who garrison the castle. The guards march from Victoria Barracks on Sheet Street, up the High Street and into Windsor Castle.  The best places to watch just before 11:00AM is Windsor High Street or on the Corn Exchange under Windsor Guildhall. Get there early to get best view. They do this I believe three times a week. It’s seasonal. We were there Friday and Saturday in February and they did not march on the Friday. When entering castle look out for the free tour guides. Ours was funny and informative and took us on external tour. We then entered and relied on the audio. Headphone guides. The castle is full of gold, drapes and glitz, with historic furniture and large airy court rooms, ante chambers,  and dining rooms. Beautiful portraits abound from classic painters such as Rubens and Van Dyck. There is the day it’s dolls house to see, along with displays of arms, armour, crockery, and lots of gifted artefacts in the royal collection. The chapel is a great visit too with many kings buried therein including a reinterred Charles I and of course the understated tomb of Henry XIII. The queens parents George VI and the Queen mother also lie in a private chapel. Great day out and of course if the  Royal Standard of the United Kingdom flag flies, the Queen is home!!"
Great visit.,"Really enjoyed a few hours wandering around.It was the weekend of the Royal wedding, (Michaels daughter) so we couldn’t access all areas of the castle but the parts we could see were very interesting and great for some good pics.My wife is royal mad so I booked a weekend trip to Windsor for her and we both agreed, this was one of the highlights!There was some fantastic architecture as well as amazing history.Tip. You can go to the church service in the chapel on Sunday morning, free of charge. It was amazing with full choir! Don’t miss it!"
Wow other than the closed parts... ,"We went to the castle to see the amazing British royal history. It truly is outstanding!So what was missing?? Well the price tag to get in is some 23£, however they fail to tell you that coming on the Sunday means you do not get access to the cathedral that the same price would give you access to any other day of the week.Do go, this is truly walking through a piece of living history!Just don't go on Sunday..."
Day out,Went on Tuesday because of the changing of the guard which happens on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday as long it's not raining
Tickets,Make sure you buy tickets from Windsor castle dedicated website so you can make a free return visits. I didn't do this and found out on arrival my tickets were valid for one visit only. Also windsor castle website would have allowed me to enter free as a carer for my special needs grandchild. The other website did not
Lovely quiet visit thanks to Coronavirus!,"We visited in February half-term expecting to fight the crowds. However, in this instance, Coronavirus has been a great help as it was very quiet. We only queued a couple of minutes to get through security checks and then no queues or large crowds to go round the dolls house, state apartments or St George's chapel. Without queues, we managed to do our visit in about 2 hours. It is what you expect of such a place but the history is interesting, particularly the chapel.Its not exactly cheap but if you buy tickets direct from the castle (or their website), and get tickets stamped before leaving, they are valid for a year."
Beautiful! ,Stunning castle and chapel. Beautiful afternoon spent. The audio was very informative and made the trip. Will be back with the rest of the family!
A wonderful experience,"Had a lovely time despite terrible weather. Visited on a Sunday when the chapel is closed but a nice bonus is that you can return any number of times for 12 months after your first visit, so returned the next day.  As it had stopped raining we had another look around the grounds and visited the chapel. Would definitely recommend a visit."
A living palace,"Windsor Castle is a very popular tourist destination where the British Royal families have spent time here for vacation & entertaining guests. There is rich collection of Royal gifts, extravagant utensils & furnitures throughout hundreds of years. It may not be as appealing & extravagant as the Versailles in France & palaces in St Petersburg, but it’s not a museum but a real palace still being occupied & used by the royal family. Visitors should note that there is no food & drinks for sale inside the Castle & a full tour can easily take few hours. It may be helpful to bring some simple snacks & drinks inside."
Worth the drive,We actually rented a car so we could head here from London. I am so glad we did. This was a really great castle to visit with so much history. The state apartments were amazing and the chapel was equally inspiring.
Very FUN and Educational,Loved seeing the castle!  Our Beefeater Tour Guide was GREAT and hilarious!  She made a tour of viewing old artifacts and history so entertaining and FUN!
Visiting this place is a must !,"One of the must-to visit areas in UK !Full of history smell, well organized, you can spend half day touring in the palace and places around."
You have to go!,"If you are in Windsor, you must visit the castle. It is just one of those places you must conquer while you are in the area. Does need some work but still it is a nice place to see."
Opulence!!,"Visited Windsor, a working castle. Very impressive staterooms, there’s countless artworks everywhere. Rubens, English masters, furniture, China. Everything in pristine and immaculate condition. Beautiful, vast and very impressive. Worth every penny!"
A Classic Must See,"This is an obvious must see for anyone wanting to experience the history of England. We came here with the London Pass which I highly recommend if you want to see all of the main attractions, save a lot of money, and don't mind running around like a crazed tourist. The London Pass included a free train ticket from Paddington Station to Windsor  & Eton Station with a train change at Slough. We went around noon and I think we must have missed all of the main tour buses because it was pretty calm at this time. We spent about 2 hours here, then spent a little time exploring the town of Windsor which I highly recommend. Very cozy place."
Another Castle & okay,Windsor Castle a royal residence at Windsor Berkshire. Had long association with the English and British royal family and has extremely old  architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Its expensive for an entry. Nothing great inside . Repair works are regularly undertaken so you miss many Rooms .
Impressive Royal State Apartments,"Been to Windsor Castle on several prior occasions - but have never actually seen the State Apartments - so we went especially when they were open to the public. Fantastic job done of re-creating those rooms which were sadly badly destroyed in the Fire. Wonderful pictures and objects on display and going on a cold day in mid February, there were no queues so we had ample time to look at everything of interest to us.Only negative point - it is pretty expensive - compared to (say) a National Trust Property."
Definitely worth a visit,"What an amazing place, the Castle and the grounds are immaculate and all the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable..St George's Chapel is absolutely beautiful, you can seeing the resting place of Henry v111 and several other monarchs. My only moan is yoh can only take photos of the outside of the castle!!!"
Magnif,"Having lived in the area for many years before relocating overseas we are amazed that we hadn’t visited before. The historic town of Windsor is great on its own but the Castle really is the highlight. We had a very knowledgeable guide called Holly for the first part of the tour and despite having a good knowledge of the history she was able to add many snippets of information previously unknown by us. The State rooms are breathtaking and we could have doubled or time there, thankfully our entry ticket which was very reasonable allows us to return as many times as we wish in the next 12 months. Great value for money. The gift shops are expensive and not too impressed by some of the range but will probably fi lol most peoples needs. I would recommend you visit and this time of year is great because it was not too busy"
Ok,"£23.50 to get in is a bit expensive  . I found the whole experience a little bit boring , the castle itself is lovely but after you’ve seen a couple of painting and things like that it gets a little bit boring , all that money , all the priceless painting , all the priceless gold plates and things like that and you have homeless people sleeping on the street outside the castle . That don’t seen right to me .sell a painting and that would put all the homeless people in Windsor in accommodation for the rest of there lives , so when your looking around at all this stuff , have a think is this right !!"
lovely place,So went to Windsor castle with my mum and young baby. it was during the weekend and must say it’s such a lovely place to visit. Mum enjoyed herself very much and fascinated about the history.
Beautiful castle - inside and out,"Windsor Castle is stunning to look out from the outside, but it is really worth the admission ticket to go in.  You can take an audio tour, which will guide you round the magnificent state apartments.  Your ticket is valid for a year, so you can make a return visit if you want.  It's worth timing your visit so that you can see the changing of the guard (you can see this from outside),"
Do it with time!,Super nice to visit but IfYou have time don’t doubt and go for at least half day. I had only like 30 min and it was not enough.
I can't believe I am in a real castle,"It is a huge place. My kids love walking going inside. There is a euphoric feeling that I am in a real castle. Not just a Disney castle, but a real one. It is just too bad Queen Elizabeth was in Scotland when we came there. We went inside the St. George Chapel, located inside the Windsor Castle. Prince Harry and Meghan got married to that chapel. Inside you're not allowed to take pictures, but you can see a different tomb of the early King and Queen. Actually, I only heard them during history class before. I am so amazed that I am standing beside their toms. Outside the chapel, you can buy souvenirs,  like rosary. I bought two. There is also a Changing of Guards inside."
Use the headphones!,"I really enjoyed this visit more than I thought I would! First of all because we went in February which is normally a quieter time and more rooms are open for viewing in the winter. And  secondly because of the fear of the Coronavirus the place was empty, so we could really see everything. These were quite a few people, mostly Asian who were whipping through the place without headphones but that to me would be a shame, the audio guide is very well done and it enriches the visit immensely (and it’s free, included in your purchase price) and when you return your headphone you can have your entrance ticket stamped once you fill in your name and sign it, in case you want to come back within the year. Nice perk. I would recommend the visit"
Great day out,We visited in September and was told we can come back as many times within tfe year We went to see the Christmas decorations as was recommended to see this.Definitely worth a visit and have the headphones so you can hear about each roomMy 12 year old had a heart and was really interested in our visit.Will definitely come back!
Great day out,We all really loved this place. My husband and I took our 14 and 11 year old here and they really took an interest in what was around. There was so much to see and different areas to tour around which was great. The only one downside I’d have to mention is that it wasn’t always clear where to go next (there wasn’t a set route for visitors if you wanted to follow one to see everything) There’s a high chance people have come out of Windsor castle having only seen half of what was available to see.
Historic Feast,This was my second visit in 4 years as I really needed to take more time around St George's Chapel to appreciate the architecture and the Order of the Garter heraldry within. Once satisfied there was plenty to see passing through the State Apartments. Maybe the £ 23 odd price of admission is a bit steep but you can ( if you remember) get the ticket stamped as you leave so that you have a year's worth of free admission.
Amazing ,Amazing history and an amazing place. Give yourself a couple of hours for the castle and a couple for the town. Take the guided tour. Easy day trip by train from London. Get tickets in advance.
Horrendous queues,"The queue was horrendous to get in, we almost gave up as we had been before.  After an hour and a half we were at the front.  Large queues to get an audio tour device so didn’t get one. The Christmas trees were not as good as last year.  No sign of changing the guard although we were there at the correct time.However, the castle is stunning and well kept.  Grounds attractive too."
Amazing place,"Going to Windsor Castle is not cheap but definitely worth every penny! Castle is simply stunning, so much history here and you have a free device and headphones with tour guide this was super helpful and gave us SO much informations. And the best part is, the ticket is valid for year, so you can come back for free during that time. Awesome and nice place for a walk as well, I will go back to learn some more details. One tip - St Gorges Chapel is closed on Sundays! So if you're interested in that, go Mon-Sat. Cheers"
A Time In History,"We found a park ... which ... how awesome ... was right behind the Castle.People were everywhere ... as you would expect.  The castle is huge, but as with all the other castles, there is a path you follow with the arrows.  This took around 3 hours and was incredible.  There is a doll’s house that was made for Queen Victoria ... commissioned by Albert.  There is electricity and water connected to the dolls house.  Sadly, we were not able to take any pix anywhere inside any building.  The artefacts which has been kept in exceptionally good condition from 1,000 years ago is amazing.The grounds and gardens are perfect and well looked after.  Would love to be a royal to live in a place like this"
Beautiful place,Lovely visit here. As a disabled person the staff were so helpful and we even got a behind the scenes peep.
It’s good to be queen!,"Great tour and worth every penny you spend. The palace opens the gates to the cathedral, personal spaces of past queens and kings and many of the personal rooms of the current queen. Everyone is very helpful and the docents are really well informed. Eat at Chippy’s at the entry to the palace!"
Beautiful,"What a lovely place to visit, I have only ever visited the outside this is the first time going in the ground and it was so worth it. We have the most loveliest day"
Beautiful - very informative,Well worth the price in my opinion (23 GBP); the state rooms and doll house are all superb and the audio guide provides so many interesting facts throughout the entire visit.
Superb visit. Very professional,Excellent tour of the fascinating Windsor Castle. An audio guide is a must and the detailed information is fascinating and the tour lasts for over 2 hours.Worth every penny. Even busy on a cold January Saturday afternoon
An experience not to be missed,"The Castle is truly magnificent and dominates every aspect of Windsor. A ticket to look around means that you have access for a year to the Castle and the Chapel, but please note that the Chapel is only open to the public on a Sunday if they are attending a service. Any other day you are free to walk around at any time. The narrative is excellent, a brief overview followed by a detailed talk if it is a section that particularly is of interest to you. The narrative guides you around the castle and the Chapel ensuring that all parts are well covered. The Doll’s House is  not to be missed, the gramophone player with the accompanying records works. The Chapel is breathtaking, from the statue of Princess Charlotte, the crypt of King George V and the alms box that is still in use."
Must Do,"Right up there with the Buckingham Palace's state rooms, this is a must-visit. Certainly it takes more coordination to get here (Tube from central London, train from Paddington with a switch in Slough), but it's worth it. A nice audio guide to lead you through the state rooms and St George's Chapel. I came on a Tuesday when the guard was changing and stood at the Guildhall for video and photos and it was excellent. I didn't go into the castle until about 1:00 pm, as cautioned on the website, and I had no lines to wait in getting through. No photos or video is allowed anywhere inside; I was rudely reminded of this when I went to take a photo out the window of ""the long walk"" and a volunteer said, ""No photography allowed! Didn't you hear me tell the last woman that?!"" No, I didn't hear that because I have an audio guide in my ears. She kind of ruined the next two rooms for me by treating me like a child, but overall a really great experience."
Windsor Castle,"Amazing place to visit, so much to see. The audio guide was really easy to use and easy to follow. There was so much to see, including tje changing of the guard."
Windsor castle tour,Amazing experience while touring the castle and looking into royal heritage and castle Whole tour experience was worth it
Winter advantages,"Nearly all parts of the castle were open to us in January, making the tour a good day. The chapel alone makes the visit worth the trip from London."
Amazing with Wheelchair,"Visited with my freinds, however few days before I was injured in a motorbike accident. Long story short I was put in a wheelchair. Staff were amazing with me made me a priority and wasn’t a single area that was difficult to get to"
Fantastic Castle,I used to go here as a youngster when youCould walk around the grounds for free. Hadn’t been since the fire but had friends visiting and they wanted to go and so glad we did.At £23.50 it is great value for money and if you get your ticket stamped you can go back as often as you want for a year. I would recommend booking online as that avoids the queues although it did take a while to get through security but that is being improved.Make sure you pick up the free audio guide which is excellent. So good to have different experts who work at the castle talking about the different rooms and al of the artifacts.The state apartments are fantastic and those rooms that were damaged by fire have been really well renovated.Also take time to see the Dolls House which is amazing.The only negative was that we went on a Sunday and St.Georges chapel was closed. Should have thought about that but we will go back.Also looking forward to when the cafe opens in 2020.This has to be one of the best castles in the world and well worth a visit
A great place to visit - best out of season when it’s quieter ,"Good value for money and includes a free guided tour or the use of headsets and a mobile device that gives commentary as you move around. The building is fantastic and steeped in history as a building but also the valuable collection of paintings, furniture and historic weapons. The areas that were damaged but the fire in 1992 have been fully restored to an excellent standard. A 3 hour+ experience walking around the fine grounds and buildings that are still in use today. The staff are very knowledgable and willing to engage to share their knowledge. Visiting St George’s church is a must and if you are lucky, as we were, you can hear the organ being played. Your access can be endorsed for no extra cost to return free of charge as many times as you like for up-to 12 months. Would definitely recommend. One of the only few 5 stars I have ever given on Trip Advisor."
Really impressed as a lot better tour than I was expecting,My partner and I booked a lweekend end in Windsor so naturally visited the castle. Only a 10 -15 minute wait in queue for tickets. Airport like scanner to check our bags and walk through scanner for us. Had chance of getting headphone tour free of chance which was easy to follow throughout our visit and gave lots of history and information. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit!
Amazing castle,We visited Windsor Castle on a Friday and decided to pre-book our tickets meaning that we could jump some of the queue.A headphone guided tour was provided which was really informative and I really liked the fact that the audio clips were only 1-2minutes long meaning that they were concise.The castle is absolutely beautiful and it is definitely worth a visit.
Great experience,My partner and I visited here yesterday although we live in Windsor had not walked around the Castle for years so glad we did definitely worth a visit.
Windsor Castle ,Took a bus on a day tour to Windsor Castle. Very nice visit to see the State Apartments where you send many luxuriously decorated rooms to receive royal or government dignitaries by the Queen.
Windsor Castle,Great day out with the family. Even the cold windy weather did not upset us because we were taken back by the beautiful grounds of Windsor Castle. The audio tour was clear and gave interesting facts about the different parts of Windsor Castle. We would definitely go back again.
Great day out,Easy to get to Windsor by road. Well sign posted and good parking nearby.You need a good 2-3 hours to do the full tour. Which takes you through the state rooms as well as St. Georges Chapel. Its a self directed excellent audio tour.
Interesting,"We visited in the new year and there no long queues to getting in.My husband is disabled and uses a mobility scooter, the staff were brilliant, very professional and helpful. In parts the staff had to take us through back rooms very interesting eg.finding out the sinks are made of rubber as the crockery is washed by hand.Was really nice seeing the staterooms especially as these are the rooms you see on t.v.Great using the audio tour has loads of interesting information.St. George’s chapel very interesting.I feel that Windsor Castle is good value for money"
Evening exclusive,Very interesting but not so exclusive as each group 30 people. Well organised and Guide ok    History of the castle and monarchy amazing.  Castle beautiful in the evening lights with good picture opportunities.  Watch the cobbles as wife twisted her knee on exit.  Would visit again as each visit an experience
Excellent insight into past and present ,"This was a great day out, learning about the monarchs past and present and their day to day experiences at home.Walking over the tomb of Henry the Eighth was certainly my personal favourite moment of the day. Though if you do come here with children of a very young age, do understand it is hard for you to read and take it everything as the young ones like to always see what’s next and the excitement of the castle for them does slightly rush your experience, if you are coming to learn I would say come with adult company only or older children (teens). Great day none the less. Would return in the future !"
Shame it was closed,We visited without checking opening times and it's closed for 2 weeks. However it was still a majestic experience seeing the castle in real life and helpful staff to direct you to the long walk.
Royal Encounter,"Exellent Organization , feel safe every moment, Beautiful Place to visit with whole family. No matter you must traver about 40 minutes fron London, the scenes are very pretty."
Expensive and horrendous long queues,"We got there early and waited in what seemed like a chaotic mess of eternally long zig zag queues. When we eventually got to purchase a ticket we realised how expensive it was at £23.50 for an adult.We were told the Chapel was closed after ticket purchase.After ticket purchase, we were less than thrilled to be faced yet again with a massive queue for the security check. Sorry but logic tells me that the security check should be done first, prior to ticket purchase, before you actually get in the building, with hundreds if people stuck in the cattle grids.After an hour or so it was absolute sheer relief to get outside in to the cold winter air.The castle grounds are lovely. Apart from that there isn't much to see apart from the State Rooms and Queen Mary dolls house, which you can't really stop and look at because you are shoved around by everyone else. Disappointing and I would not go back."
Stunning  visit at Christmas full of history art and grandeur,"It's the first time we have been in the castle at Christmas,  it was magical so much to see. We took friends from the US and they loved it. Also took them to Hampton Court  place  and it was just as impressive. We are so lucky to have such history at our finger tips here in the UK. 5star both not to be missed."
Interesting for all the family,"With ages ranging from 9 to 57, the whole family found this a fascinating place to visit.The audio definitely guides help with understanding various aspects of the castle, inside and out."
The reason to visit Windsor ,"Do the Castle tour. Your ticket affords a second trip within 12 months, provide you validate it with the staff."
Worth it,We visited with my kids. Nice walk. Exquisite scenery. We didn’t go in though because we were amazed by its beauty. Definitely a must if u are in the area.
Wonderful tour of British history,"We thoroughly enjoyed the three hours we spent wandering around the castle and grounds and luckily the weather was on our side.  We pre-booked our tickets online which definitely reduced the number of queues we had to stand in, so worth doing.  Our only disappointment was that they were not offering the usual separate queues for the State apartments and another for the Dolls house and the State apartments which meant one huge queue and endless crowds. It might not have been the busiest Sunday but we felt it could have been better organised."
Windsor castle,"Although outside of castle is impressive, access to most of the castle is very limited. Can see why it attracts a lot of overseas visitors from a royal point of view but not the most interesting of historic buildings."
Mrs Gonzalez,Awesome place to visit! We enjoyed very much It takes more than two hous and there are great landscapes and I specially recommend the apartment suites. Awesome!
Underwhelmed by Christmas Decorations,"As we live local, we have been to Windsor Castle several times. Whilst the castle visit was as good as ever, having seen lots of ads for the Castle Christmas Decorations, we were underwhelmed by the supposed decorations. However our tickets last for a year so will be back again."
"Really impressive, a must for foreign visitors.","A quick visit to validate a gift of an annual pass.My wife told me to see the Christmas trees before they were taken down and also the Queen's dolls house as it is not always open,.The place is enormouse like a small town, I  was very impressed with the lovely moat garden seen over the wall on the way in.l.. The dolls house needs more light but the detail is stunning.(Get on your hands and knees)The decorations on the grand staircase were impressive followed by a room and table set for Queen Victoria's breakfast.Other state apartments had beautifully decked trees, as did St George's chapel. simple but effective.Juast dashing round took over an hour.I will be back very soon and see it all properly."
History at your finger tips,"If you ever go to the UK, PLEASE visit Windsor Castle. Do the walks with the wardens and learn the history of the very old keep, and castle. See Her Majesty's front lawn, look through the windows and doors to one of the greatest views in London, watch the guards patrol and march. Go to the Church and see where Kings and Queens gather for Prayer. Enjoy the castle, visit the town and enjoy a pint at one of the pubs. If you don't drink, eat at one of the pubs, enjoy a cup of tea and watch people come and go.The place is amazing."
A must Visit,"Beautiful Castle, lots of history. You need at least 2 hours to finish the tour. We’re lucky to witness the changing of guards which it doesn’t happen often."
Great Place to Visit,The whole place is quite fantastic lots to see and such a lot of history . Naturally security is high but got through checks quickly. Quite a few souvenirs shops too. Disappointed that the chapel was closed but with new yearly ticket they offer it’s a good excuse to visit again when it’s warmer. Highlight was Queen Victoria dolls house and Van Dyke paintings. Go u won’t be disappointed!
Great history here,It is amazing to see the living history of this castle.  It is getting close to being 1000 years old and yet it still holds our fascination to this day.The grounds are simply breath taking and can easily inspire you to create an English garden in your own backyard when you get home.
multimedia guide essential and entertaining,"We visited the beautiful Windsor castle. If you love English history this is the place for you!! It is compact and bursting with history. DEFINITELY take advantage of the free multi-media guide. It was fantastic and you get so much more out of your visit. They also have a special version for children which was much loved by my 11 year old.We went on a very quiet rainy day, absolutely no queues, very relaxed."
Great experience!!!,"Hi there, I'm not a great one for writing much. But visiting Windsor Castle is a great experience, informative and unique - I love it, the kids love it and our guests and visitors LOVE IT too!!! Visit and enjoy!!!"
Only go if you've got a whole day to find parking and wait in long queues.,We had already prebooked our tickets but still waited a long time and then more queues inside for the doll house. Extremely expensive all items in the gift shops plus for a can of water we had to pay £2.50!!! The amount of people entering should be reduced in order to help with the queues and maybe reconsider pricing?
Spectacular history,"It was a special experience totally worths it. I was always excited to come here someday and see this building. It is not really a long journey from London takes only 40 minutes by train. On arrival I had to realise it's gonna be a long ride without ticket.The queue was unexpectedly long at the end of December. I beleive staff members were surprised too. Even the ticket holders had to wait to be picked from the line which is an incredibly clever move. After 2 hours waiting I managed to buy my ticket. I really enjoyed the whole journey here. My favourites were the St. George Chapel and The State Apartments are real iconic, astonishing and breathtaking. You'll be guarenteed to have some ""wow"" moments here. It's highly recommended for couples, groups or families even solos to do it as a half day activity."
Windsor Castle is a must see on your visit to London,So glad we made the trip to Windsor.  Easy cab ride of 40 mins and 45 pounds.  The town is so quaint.  The castle and church are full of history but even more so a working church and castle.  We were able to visit the state apartments.  The art work and artifacts from around the world are amazing.  The grounds are massive.  The church where Harry and Megan wed come to life when you stepInside.  We had a wonderful lunch in town and shipped.  Then a 15Min walk to Eton College.  Make sure you get tickets we got right inside.  Others waited 2hours.  Very cool.  A must see
Well worth the trip,The palace may get overlooked because it isn’t in the centre of London but is well worth the trip. The free tour provided context and the audio tours the detail.  Understandably you cant take photos but that was the only issue.
Didn’t expect to enjoy this much.,"I think anyone can appreciate Windsor castle. Beautiful place, the grounds, and staff were immaculately presented. Make sure you get there early to queue, even if pre paid as that takes time. Long wait and security style search. Once in, it’s easy to follow, but I strongly recommend going to the chapel for 09:30-10:00 for the change of guard!!Down sides are, no parking there, but car parks are close by, however these are £15+ for 5 hour. Pay the £18 for day and visit windsor the town as well. Wish we had visited the week before Christmas as the feel was very Christmassy."
Windsor castle,"Absolutely great experience. Even if one is not passionate about history it's still worth a visit. There's a little bit for everyone: architecture, medieval weapons and armours, interior design, china.I would definitely recommend a visit"
Must see attraction!  Free audio tour included. ,"Amazing experience. Tip #1 - buy tickets the day before. You can walk right up and enter through the fast queue.  We did not buy tickets.  Arrived at 11:30am, waited outside for 35 minutes, and then inside for 15 minutes.  Adult tix were £22 each. Tip #2 - you don’t need an extra guide or guidebook.  Free self-guided audio tour for each person.  It was excellent. You could stop at each room and listen to the full audio, or just listen to portions (like the Intro). Tip #3- Arrive via Windsor and Eton Station.  We arrived via connections of Paddington and Slough, got off the  train, walked through the shopping mall, and Windsor Castle was right there - just a quick walk up the hill. That is also where the line for the entrance started.  Just a beautiful day."
Birthday Treat,"We went here for my 62nd birthday treat, not sure what to expect as I use a mobility scooter. I must say it was the most enjoyable visit ever. Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff, as being unable to use stairs they catered for my disability perfectly, always there to help and guide us around. The staff are so knowledgeable about the castle, especially Phillip. I would certainly go there again"
Royal Ascot,When for Races stayed travel lodge near all shops bars restaurants Castle no taxis needed.walk away from everything.. Do need taxi to races and travel lodge is near Tran Station lovely relaxing place beautiful castle was amazing
Nostalgic,Full of Historical Interest and Artefacts especially Queen Mary’s Dolls House a brilliant piece of WorkAlso the Xmas tree is Quite Stunning
Stunning as usual!,"I visited Windsor Castle for the third time and I am already planning to visit again. It is the oldest working castle in the UK and its opulence is beyond belief. The staff are friendly, the rooms are amazingly kept and the fairytale atmosphere is tangible throughout.Please visit!!"
Visited when Megan and Harry's baby was born!,By coincidence we were there when the Royal baby was born so it was very exciting to see the celebration . We were even interviewed by a TV station as to our reaction of the Royal birth. The castle is a MUST to see...you go through it and see many of the rooms and the grounds are amazing! We enjoyed this excursion and highly recommend it!
Follow these tips for worthwhile trip,"Tips: 1. Prebook tickets if you can to avoid upwards of an extra 90 minutes in line upon arrival2. Touring of the State Rooms and St. George’s were great - Queen Ann’s dollhouse was not good or interesting 3. Include a leisure walk to Eton College and enjoy Eton village4. Dinner at wagamama was excellent, Lastly:Top tip: Stay for the day into the evening and be one of the 100 (or fewer) spectators to enter St. George’s at 5 pm for evensong. It was ethereal, magical and unforgettable to be serenaded by an all boys choir in this dimly lit and iconic setting."
Overcrowded ,"Queues, queues, queues....Far too many people makes what should take an hour last half a day. The castle, St George’s chapel etc are all well worth seeing but there are queues for everything, not only entry. They should sell fewer, timed tickets rather than the free-for-all it is currently.....oh, and you need to be royalty to afford anything inside - £2.50 for a small can of water?....we were not amused!"
Interesting and informative ,"It’s a super couple hours walking around understanding not just the history of the castle but the time line from 1066 to present day Informative and interesting, long Q so buy your tickets online before which should reduce your entrance time to 30 mins"
Fantastic Helpful Staff,"When we first approached the queue to gain entrance looked huge, however due to my husbands disability we were able to gain earlier access, passing quickly through security and being advised the best route to go where they would then radio ahead to advise the next member of staff we were heading their wayWe gained access through a side door and were guided into the dolls house room , this exhibit was fantastic, the detail is so realisticThe staff then ushered us along to the next rooms avoiding the stairs and then we were taken throuugh to a lift and assisted up to the next level where we were met again and almost given a private tour with our own guide , once finished here we were shown on round and then back down in the lift, the staff were so friendly and helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our experienceWe would highly recommend this as a place to visit, the queue of people waiting to enter speaks for itself"
Pre purchase Windsor castle tickets,DON'T USE TRIP ADVISOR TO PRE PURCHASE TICKETS. YOU CAN'T GET REFUND IF HAVE TO CANCEL EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS YOU CAN ON THEIR WEBSITE ON MAIN PAGE!  Purchased Windsor castle tickets prior to weekend away. Couldn't go as husband took I'll 3 days before. Cancelled hotel but despite trip advisor clearly stating you could cancel with 100% refund they wouldn't even though I was well within time limit for cancelling.  Lost full amount of money for pre purchased tickets. Will never use trip advisor for pre bookings again.
Christmas visit,"Visited castle week before christmas with elder mother with walking difficulties. Bought tickets before which seem to cut down quite a bit of time although the queue through security was quite long.The castle is beautiful, had never been before although visited Windsor many times. Grounds beautifully kept and the state apartments were stunning!Special mention to the guides and staff, my mum struggles with walking especially with stairs and they were on hand to help at every opportunity to point out the lifts and help her get around easily. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble and made the day a pleasure.Only down sides not being able to take photos but that actually kept things moving better and the gift shop was quite expensive other than that brilliant day out!"
What an experience,"What a wonderful visit, first time to Windsor Castle, not the last, amazing experience, really friendly and knowledgable staff, can’t wait to return"
School Trip,I was a parent helper at a school trip. We took sixty 6 & 7 years olds. The trip tied in with their topic for the term. The castle was very well organised & the tour guide made the trip age appropriate. Such a lovely castle to visit & even the adults learned some new interesting facts.
Day out,Took the grandchildren and they really enjoyed the visit  so much history to see if you live in windsor you can get in for free with your advantage card also you can see changing of the guard  at the castle which is fantastic
Visited on Christmas eve,Buying tickets in advance is a must as the queues are very long and could take at least 90 minutes to get in. We had tickets and still waited over 30 minutes to get through security. Arrived just in time to see the changing of the guard. Luckily there were no queues to go into the chapel which is very interesting. Visitors should find out the history of the castle and not just about recent events. A fantastic castle and absolutely huge.
Very interesting ,"Great palace , very organized.   Good for kids.  They will love it.  Town all around also very nice. Really worth the visit"
Incredible place full of history,"Had a great time here. The staff were so informative and nice throughout. Top tips:Book earlyAsk the guards when the changing of the guard is taking place (think it's 12pm or so), it's cool to watchTake your time going around each section - the audio guides are brilliant"
Great Few Hours,Had a great time today at Windsor Castle. Got there at 9am to wait in the queue for 10am opening. Got in quickly. The staff were so wonderful and kind. The Palace was just magical. Loved every moment there. Can't wait to go back.
Worth a visit.,Travelling between London and Cardiff we stopped to visit Windsor Castle. We bought our tickets in advance and enjoyed our visit. As can be expected access was limited to certain areas of the castle and there were a lot of visitors on the day but after visiting the castle and then strolling through the small town of Windsor it's easy to see why the Queen enjoys her time here.
Good but ridiculous queuing system,"Windsor castle is well worth a visit for royal fans,  the price is good considering you can return all year. I have visited on weekdays before and walked straight in. This time I visited on a Saturday and the queue was hideous. When we arrived it was the changing of the guard and there was no way of telling who was watching this and who was actually queuing. When the guard had changed we joined the back of a very big queue. This queue then didn't move for half an hour while the old guard came back out. When the queue still didn't move i found a member of staff (as no one was explaining anything) who said the queue would be at least two hours. There was a queue to get in, a queue to buy tickets and then a queue through security. After all the queuing, the castle was well worth a visit, with more to see than Buckingham palace. I would recommend going  in December as the decorations are beautiful but I will go on a weekday next time!"
Beautiful working castle ,"Visited with the family and arrived just in time for the changing of the guard which is a must. Visited at George’s chapel all beautiful and really nicely kept. We left the inside for a further visit ,"
One amazing castle,"The largest castle in the world and a must see. Just outside London, I recommend a day trip to visit this treasure. It is an amazing architectural feat, filled with history and priceless objects. Be sure to visit St. George's chapel. Stroll into town for lunch or tea and walk along the river."
Beautiful Castle,"Well worth a visit. Getting here from London you catch the tube to Paddington station. Go to the ticket office at Paddington Train Station (don't buy tickets from the ticket machine) as they will give you a better deal. You then catch the train to Slough, get off that train and then onto another train to Windsor. (One stop) It is very easy. Make sure when you are getting the train at Paddington to Slough that you quickly get to your train when you see it on the board otherwise you will miss it. People start running to get on the train to get a seat and not miss it. The train ride is also quite expensive.There is no photographs in Windsor Castle but you can take photos in the grounds. There is toilet facilities but no cafes. However within walking distance of the castle is cafes in the main town and there is plenty of shops and places to eat. We didn't shop but it would be nice to visit the Castle in the morning and then wander the streets in the afternoon. You need about 2 hours at the castle. Well worth a visit."
Windsor Castle.,Must see!  Great self guided tour.  The town of Windsor was fabulous! Highly recommend. Lots of shops and dining.
A Must Visit,A really interesting castle with so much to take in.Do pick up the audio guide as you start your tour. It has so much information.Took us 2.5 hrs not including St George’s chapel which is closed on Sunday due to services. Very much enjoyed the evening service in the chapel.Visited the chapel the next morning
Worth visiting from London,"Highly recommended. You have to spent a day in Windsor, its a beautiful small town. Only 45 mins from central London and the castle is so beautiful. Audio guide explains everything in detail and there are also live guide tours."
Not the best ,"Busy with rude tourists, mainly of asian decent, really over priced to basically tour a small fraction of someone's house, I understand its got history but a simple google search would give more info and a better understanding of its history, the dolls house queue was way to long and time consuming, so didn't get to see it this time but have seen It before many years ago and is worth queuing up for, should have a resident pass where you can skip the tourist queues."
Worth the visit,Went during the summer and pleasantly surprised how much there is to see. We went particularly to see where our kings and queens are buried. Took a guided tour which was included in ticket price which was well worth doing. The only downside is windsor itself very disappointing and shabby can't believe the queen lives there though I suppose she never ventures out into the high stret
Wonderful,"Okay, as a History buff I admit I'd never visited the Queens house. What a great time! As a Birthday present I was taken, with the children. We all had a thoroughly good time.Visiting in December-time, and pre-booked - essential to beat the long queues. The guides are fabulous, and the State-rooms are great. Toilet facilities are a little scarce if taking young ones, and don't expect wall walks. It's a real living castle. The gift shops are a bit commercial and expensive - aimed at tourists. As an experience though it can't be faulted. Any history chaser will love it!"
Wonderful Windsor,"Very pretty Castle, comparable elements to Versailles. I t has splendid views, and the guards and staff are friendly and helpful. The apartments are full with art and history, they make you feel like you can imagine living there as a king / queen.It would be even better if more of the castle would be available for guests, but there was more than enough to explore for a whole day. And if you have it stamped, you can come back for free for a year.."
Fantastic ,Loved exploring the castle. Highlight for me was the dolls house - fascinating!!! I would highly recommend booking ahead as we were able to walk straight past some very long queues!!!
A must do,"Wow just got home after trip down to London, windsor castle is a real must do, so much to see, so beautifully decorated with Christmas trees and decorations. cant wait to go back but maybe in summer next time"
Amazing - State Room Tour is AWESOME!,"SO the Queen was there the day we went--the royal standard (flag) was flying indicating her presence. That was cool it and of itself. Getting to tour the State Rooms where she STILL conducts business at times is amazing--that access is really something. Also the St. George's Chapel is stunning. Beautiful. One small room I came upon in the church was for HRH QE II's Mother and Father to rest, and her sister Margaret. Very moving. One wonders if she too will rest there one day, and her husband as well?"
Thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon exploring the castle and grounds,"We were staying in Windsor overnight so a visit to the castle was an absolute must.  Yes, it’s a little pricey to get in but the fact you can use your ticket again within a 12 month period is a plus as it would be nice to come back and visit again in the summer.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit as the Christmas decorations were up around and in the castle and the Queen certainly does have stunning Christmas trees the scale of them is unreal.We wandered the grounds and visited the chapel which is fascinating with so many important kings and queens from our history buried there and the chapel itself is stunning but smaller then we were expecting having seen it on tv for the royal wedding.We then headed into the house and first visited Queen Mary’s dolls house speaking to one of the staff he explained it was just for show and had never been played with which I can understand but such a shame, it is every little girls dream house.We then went through the state apartments, that’s were we found the magnificent trees and a dining table set out for dinner groaning under the weight of the table settings.  We found the staff in the state rooms a little unapproachable and one women in particular who was rather snooty and gave the impression she really didn’t want to answer any questions at all, which is a great shame as the staff are usually a wealth of knowledge and very interesting to talk to.We spent a couple of hours exploring the castle and it is well worth a visit."
Very good day out,There is so much to see here and it is all done extremely well. The staff are friendly and the volunteers outstanding. There is something for everyone and you can easily spend a good part of the day here. I've been a few times and will go again when Queen Mary's dolls house has been restored.
Not worth the visit,"I found Windsor castle to be very disappointing. Since it is used as the Queens residence a good portion of it was closed off. The state apartments we were able to see were rather boring in my opinion and what would have been the highlight, to see the tomb of King Henry VIII in St. George’s Chapel was closed"
Full of history. ,A must see whilst you’re in the area. Lovely to walk up the very same isle that Prince Harry and Meghan walked! Very knowledgeable staff.
Wonder experience,"We had a wonderful tour of the castle, more amazing than I expected. Much prettier than Buckingham castle."
Amazing,"The castle visit was amazing, so much history inside! It is a representation of the British empire greatness from all the years! Must arrive early to visit all areas with no hurry!"
Tour of Windsor Castle,"Well worth the entrance fee. Excellent interactive audio guide with headphones once you get the hang of it. Allow at least 2 hours and pick a less busy time. It was not busy on 5th December, no queues. Have seen queues down the street which would make for a very different experience."
Fantastic Place to visit outside London,"This was not my first time at Windsor castle because it was such a great place to visit.Tip #1: try to avoid visit on Sunday because you won’t be able to access to St George’s Chapel as it won’t be opened to the public visit.If you arrive later in the day, the queue would be shorter. I came in at 2 pm and there were only a few people in line.Tip#2: Save your admission ticket and as you exit, present to it to the people on the right side, they will ask you to sign at the back in front of them and gave you a stamp. You can then use that for another year.Plan to spend at least 2 hours there. Tip#3: no photography of any kind is allowed inside the castle.My favorite part was the Queen’s doll house. Don’t skip and Check it out. This place closed at 4:30 pm in the winter so plan accordingly. You can get a direct train from Waterloo station to Windsor Eaton and Riverside Station. Note as of December 2019, there are strikes going on with Southwestern Railway until Jan 2020. However, I didn’t have any issue with the train at all.I highly recommend this place if you want to take a break from busy London."
Visiting with Russian friends,"Windsor Castle has a fabulous history and is well preserved.  The interior is very interesting and has resonance today with visitors, as it is an operating castle.  Please note on Sundays the chapel is closed for services.  The shop has some interesting gifts and souvenirs.  I would DEFINITELY recommend the audio tour guide, which was very informative and offered in a number of different languages (including Russian).  In certain interior rooms there are employees who will answer your questions about historical matters or the background to an item on display.  The dolls house is amazing!  There is no catering within the castle.  Windsor town is a lovely shopping area.  There is a lovely walk down by the River Thames, with all the swans.  There is a train that goes straight back to London Waterloo. The train into Windsor is the 'Windsor and Eton' station."
A must see.,Some renovations happening but still didn't distract from how the Royal Family live.  Totally different world.  Just jaw dropping.  We were lucky to visit Buckingham Palace and it is even more out of our world.  We parked in town in paid parking 10 minutes walk.
Windsor Castle is beautiful,Recently went to see The Windsor Castle. My husband and I thought it was so beautiful and interesting. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They was so much to see in there. Allow yourself plenty of time to see it all. The town of Windsor had some quaint little shops and we wish we would have allowed more time to see some of them. Next visit we definitely will be able to see it all.
A good day out ,"Having won afternoon tea we booked the castle visit as a way of making my wife’s birthday. Have to say we had a great time it’s well worth the visit, be sure to use the free audio tour as it explains all the history as you walk about. Ever helpful staff also made it a delight as they were on hand to answer questions. Only down side is being disabled with limited walking ability having to park at the bottom of the hill was a disaster for me, those who have disabled passengers are best off dropping them off and then parking up. Over all a delight of a day"
Lots of history,We went there yesterday it was not very crowded. We booked tickets online so did not have to queue up.The state apartments dolls house and St. George's chapel were all open to the public. They had a special exhibition about queen Victoria and Albert at Christmas which was very interesting.
Royalty Castle,"I love castles. So Windsor Castle was great. Staff were friendly and warm. You can get a tour guide or a recording tour guide, or solo. I loved looking around. I really loved St George's Chapel. My only wish was to see more but I can understand security with the Queen and family."
Gorgeous - and people actually live here!,"It's worth the price of admission - and comes with a 1year long re-entry voucher in case you want to go again.  Absolutely immaculate and stunning.  Very interesting audio tour, and many of the docents were helpful and friendly."
Britain at its best,"Great to see inside one of the few lived-in ‘classic’ castles with turrets, state rooms and guards with busbies. Security is slightly challenging but a worthwhile necessity. Lots of shopping opportunities. Great to see inside living history."
Enjoyed the Town of Windsor,"We parked near the Thames and should have realized we would need more time but it had been raining and we weren't sure how long we would want to stay.  Parking was 7 GBP for just 2 hours.  Since we did not have time to take the tour of the castle, we will have to come back another time.  We enjoyed taking pictures of the exterior and walking around this charming town with lots of little shops and restaurants.  We had a lovely affordable lunch of pasta and pizza at Zizzi  across the road from a section of the castle.  Overall a great 2 hours!"
Gorgeous!,Loved it. Lots to see. Was a beautiful castle and grounds. Highly recommend a visit. There is an audio guide available for your trip. We also got to partially see the changing of the guard as they walked up the street as we arrived.
Christmas at windsor,"Been to Windsor castle which i think is really lovely, so decided to see the Christmas decorations, well one dinning room which was we presume would have been for Victoria and Albert, other than that 3 Christmas trees, I have seen National Trust places done far better, nothing in place to take people who find it difficult to walk from the checking in area up to the castle and it's a long walk, but there is a lift inside so you can avoid the entrance steps"
Changing of Guard with Band Take Green Bus,"Yes, it is great to see but inside castle you can't take pictures.  No photography !  Plan ahead to view guard with band as schedule changes.  You can get pretty close to guard and take photo's.  Getting here can be difficult.............finally discovered Green Bus 702? from Victoria Collonade - really cheap and takes a couple of hours - local commuter bus with various bus stops."
Just Wow,"Having seen the castle on the tv and after the royal wedding Windsor was a must visit for me! Was not disappointed, climbed to the top of the round tower and could not believe the views! A trip to the Queens farm shop is a must for any foodie."
Impressive!,Was here as part of my booked day trip! Castle was amazing! No photography allowed in the rooms. The dining room look so interesting! Accessible by train i think. Worth coming here. The mushroom melts sandwich at EAT shop was so good. One of the places u must go if you r in London!
A must for anyone remotely interested in history and royalty,"As a true royalist this was a must see that I would highly recommend. Yes, it does seem a bit tricky to get here from London but in reality it takes no more than 1-1,5 hours by underground and train/Uber/bus. The castle is impressive with the State Rooms and the sheer size of the whole building but it is very interesting to be able to take part of this working castle and see rooms for various ceremonies that take place throughout the year. An audio guide assists throughout the tour."
Windsor Castle,"Wonderful visit here today. What a fabulous place! We looked round some of grounds first, visited The Dolls House( a huge ‘dolls house’  built to show-case different skills available in England,  everything is on a smaller scale and works! ). St. George’s Chapel was wonderful but there was a lot going on here today, the Organ was being serviced and all the pews were upside down, so it was a bit of a mess but still worth a look. We saw where Henry Vlll was interred.The State Apartments are really worth a visit, take your time and walk around them. Make sure you get the Audio-Guide, it explains everything for you. Each room was amazing and must take a lot of up-keep.So many precious items/curtain hangings/ flock wall-paper/furniture to look at. Amazing and wonderful. We also saw the Changing of The Guard. If you get the chance you should definitely visit when this takes place(Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 11 a.m.  It is a fantastic spectacle.We had a fab time"
Fantastic way to spend an afternoon,"My disabled wife and I have just spent a lovely visit at Windsor Castle, I can understand why Her Majesty loves it so much. Lovely polite, knowledgeable staff ( their knowledge was  boundless)  and gave us a really lovely tour of the castle including the Accessibility lifts.Absolutely enjoyable way to spend 4 hours on a Friday"
Monday @ the Castle,"Being mega obsessed with the royals this trip to Windsor Castle did not disappoint. The Castle is kept in immaculate condition and everything you can see is outstanding. An added touch (which I didn’t realise) was that you have a interactive tour for the price of your ticket so an explanation of every room/place you go in is in your ears as you poodle along. We were very lucky to see Guards marching along too, we had a great time and will return in years to come!"
Real Castle!!,Very impressive... I didn't know what to expect... but it was completely beautiful... you really need to take your time here... and the small cozy town is very nice as well.
Excellent Audio Tour,Though the process of entering the castle for the tour is time consuming and cumbersome the actual ground and tour were not crowded. The self guided audio was very good and it was really cool to see the apartments and chapel where history is still taking place to this day.
Fascinating!! ,"A great day out for adults and kids alike you can spend a few hours absorbing hundreds of years of history in just a few hours... maybe the Queen will even be home! See Henry 8th’s grave, Queen Mary’s dolls house and the Staterooms... to name a few.I would recommend the tour - our guide Colin was very funny, engaging and knowledgable. Gives you a great overview - and starts your visit on the best foot.Just be aware there are no cafes inside the grounds - there is no where at all for a drink or anything to eat. So remember to ask for your wristband and you can come and go as you want."
Grand Castle!,"Really loved my visit to the Windsor Castle. We took a bus to Windsor from London and even the bus ride was scenic (despite the rain!). The Queen Mary's Dollhouse was closed from viewing when we visited, which is a pity, but overall it was still a great visit. Important tip: Try to reach there before opening time, as it does get pretty crowded quickly. Also, if you check their schedule beforehand, you might be able to catch the changing of guards (weather dependent). It was raining quite a bit when we went, so despite it being on the schedule, the changing of guards ended up being cancelled."
Awesome,"This was a really nice trip— beautiful castle and we werelucky to see the changing of the guards—ceremony a bit long Though.  Tip: buy your ticket before you get there, to skip the long line outside. Nice to see a real castle looking castle."
The home of the Windsors!,"This was the third time that we had visited Windsor Castle. Once again, we were able to use our London Passes to gain admission to the castle and its grounds.When we arrived at the entrance point for the castle, the line to purchase general admission tickets was very long. Fortunately the line for pre-purchased tickets and London Pass holders was much shorter. Even so, it still took us about 20 minutes to pass through the ticket office area and the security checkpoint. The security checkpoint is similar to the type that you find at airports. Unfortunately, on the day of our visit some folk did not appear to be familiar with the procedures involved and their lack of preparedness for the security check tended to slow down the advance of the queue. Once inside the castle grounds, we collected our audio-visual guides and progressed on to do another self-guided tour of the castle. The large number of visitors present on this day tended to slow down the progress of our tour in certain parts of the castle.We went straight to the courtyard area next to St. George’s Chapel to view the brief Changing of the Guard ceremony. Afterwards, we joined the hordes touring the interior of the chapel. At the time of our visit, parts of the state apartments were under renovation and there was a queue to enter the rooms which were still open to the public visitors. There was a wait of about 10 minutes before we were able to enter the state apartments.If you would like to purchase a memento of your visit to Windsor Castle three well-stocked gift shops can be found within the castle buildings. The gifts and souvenirs are of a good quality with prices to match. All three of the shops were doing a good trade when we visited them whilst at the castle.We thoroughly enjoyed our third visit to Windsor Castle and highly recommend it as a “must-see” attraction for any tourists who happen to be visiting this part of England."
Stunning 😍,"Once you have paid your entry fee to the Castle, you can go back as many times as you want, within 12 months of initial purchase ! Audio Tour is a must...the views are breathtaking and the inside is unbelievable filled with history and wonderful treasures. Utterly stupendous Dolls House..highly recommend."
Awesome morning with my daughter,"Arriving early due to the warning about queues we were pleasantly surprised to see that Tour groups are in one line and individuals in another (wearing my Springbok rugby jersey the day after we beat England in the RWC2019 also helped), we were told to come back 15 minutes before opening as the line was not long at all.Once inside (and the first to go in ... again the Springbok rugby jersey was of some assistance!) it was an amazing experience to view the splendour of how the other half live.  Being a Sunday the chapel was closed but the State Rooms were really worth the visit and the bonus is that our tickets are now valid for a full 12 months ... free re-entry if you book online."
Impressive royal castle,"Didn’t have time to explore the interior, nor the inclination to pay £23 for the privilege. But the exterior of this huge castle dominates the centre of Windsor and its skyline. A must see for tourists with an interest in British history and the Monarchy."
Spectacular,Unbelievable views and spectacular gardens. There was a band playing outside. Magnificent. A must if you are in the area.
Beautiful Castle site in a Beautiful Town ,"Interest to know one of the oldest, biggest Castle still in use by the Royal families.I did a day tour, given a entrance tag, and the security is tied, just like that in the airport.Upon arriving at the bus park, the guide showed us around the small town while walking towards the castle.In the castle, we jsu followed the audio which bring us around the different parts of the castle. There are friendly staff guiding and directing if we are at a lost. Inside the castle suites, no photography is allowed. Therefore, only outside, we can take pictures of the interior of the castle.I enjoyed the audio guided tour and are free to explore on my own instead of following the guide.I spent almost 2 hours in the castle and another 1 hour exploring the town, River Thames and the nearby park.I like to stroll along River Thames. A very pleasant walk with the geese and birds, smooth flowing river."
Royal retreat,Stunning architecture. Magnificent state rooms and incredibly detailed doll's house.Very stringent airport-like security but well organised entry. fast tracked when you purchase your tickets in advance.Impressed with the merchandise in the shops.  My wife purchased a few Christmas presents there.Would have liked to walk around the grounds but didn't all seem to be open-obviously weather/season dependent.
Beautiful,"Just a little bit outside London, the Windsor Castle is a really castle to visit during a day out trip. There is a lot to see outside and inside and the trip is really worth."
Stunning Castle,One of the most amazing castle's I have visited. There so much to see you can quite easily spend the whole day there.
Stunning location. Full of British history. St George's Chapel was a revelation,"First visit to the Castle. Found the signage a little unclear at first as we were advised to go straight to St George's Chapel as it would be closing first. Audio guide very interesting, I usually ignore these and prefer to wander round myself but the information was clear and succinct and I did not want to miss a thing! State apartments were as sumptuous as expected. I really enjoyed the visit. If you get your ticket stamped on the way out, you can return for free for a year!"
Windsor Castle,"I was so excited to finally have seen a castle. Overall, it was a great experience, I do wish we were able to see more. Different rooms, etc."
Outstanding,It's an amazing castle. Buying the ticket in advance is important. It eliminates standing in line at the castle. Allows more time to explore.
A winter visit to the Queen's Castle,"I visited on my own in November 2019. Decided to go then as I thought (rightly) that it would be a quiet(er) time to visit this royal palace. Had an excellent guided tour from a member of staff with the Royal Collection Trust, and he could not have been more interesting! Explained all about the castle's history, including the Norman arrival and conquest. Next came the State Apartments, with treasures from all over the world, and finally the un-missable St George's Chapel, burial place to 10 monarchs! Yes, it is a bit pricey (£20 ish) per adult, but remember it IS a Royal Palace! Don't miss."
Castle tour is for the fit and able,"Windsor is an impressive castle which dominates the town and skyline. Visitors need to buy an entry ticket to make the most of their appreciation of the castles history and role. It is a working castle and about 200 people live and work there. The chapel is open to the public and is a working church and is separate from the Castle. Be prepared to walk several kilometres, up and down hills and stairs, without elevators, during the walking tour. The portable commentary devuce provided to visitors was very confusing. It did not follow the sequence of the tour. I gave up trying to find the right commentary for each room in the Castle and listened to about 50% of it. So much time was wasted trying to find the right commentary which ultimately shortened my visit and made the tour very frustrating."
Good value and worth a visit,Get there early and try go in the non tourist times. If you want to see the chapel where the bodies are buried have to go during on a weekday. Rooms and decor very interesting. Every room and painting a history lesson. Can see all the gifts the royals have received on their trips. Audio guides available are available. I’ll go again just to see the town.
Incredible castle but ....,"We visited the Castle this morning, paid the ticket £22.50 and to our surprise they didn’t tell us that there is no Change of Guards or that the Chapel is closed on Sundays!!!! So we paid full price for just to see the State Rooms, they should tell the people this before charging the full price, we were not happy at all! Do not go on Sunday! They should give you the option of lower price if the visit to the Chapel is not available (every Sunday)!"
A must visit!,"Picturesque and truly awesome. You can get ear phones and a gadget to help you explain everything when walking around. I found the amount of china on display awesome could imagine using it to impress family and friends but would not want to wash it up after. So delicate hahaha. The dolls house is a must visit as all so very tiny WOW astounding. The chapel was awesome where Harry and Megan married it must of been so dreamy for them, it’s a real shame they get such a lot of stick from the English population it can not be easy living within this huge family. I would not want to do it for all the queens China! Amazing train station at Windsor, tiny and very quaint.Only down side someone begging on a corner opposite the Castle. Off putting for tourism."
