Interesting Finds,A must see. Very interesting to see inventions of years ago. Reasonable entry fee. Takes about an hour to view.
World Heritage Site,"The Jantar Mantar located near City Palace Jaipur is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh I, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. You need a guide to tell you about all those astonishing large instruments.…"
The real jaipur,"Place where u can see real jaipur and what jaipurs art from a long time in history , timing information is available.on the site please check before visiting "
A surprisingly interesting and educational  experience!!,"Science as a subject in school was never really my thing, but I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this site.  It was like an ancient science experiment come to life.  Built between 1727-34 AD it has a noteworthy collection of traditional astronomical instruments.  I recommend a guide as most of the items would be impossible to determine what they are/were or used for.  If science isn't your thing the angles and geometry if the instruments also make them very photogenic, the while place was a great unexpected surprise for me.  I wish we had had more time there.…"
Great,Best observatory in the world & very well maintained. Here I came to know that in old times how people knows the time
Fantastic experience of early science.,"This site is a must when you are in Jaipur but do take a tour otherwise it is near impossible to understand the complexities and science of the site. It is the largest observatory in India. We were expecting to see telescopes but the area is dedicated to shadows and movements of the sun and stars with shadows cast as the sun moves around at various times of the day indeed months and year. It is amazing how the early Indian scientists, going back 300 years, were able to document and predict times and locations based on the solar system. Horoscopes are catered for and all the astrological signs are there. To look at the park it appears more of an amusement or architectural centre until one has the explanations  about the geometry and lines of shadows and light. Quite amazing. A modest entry fee applies and we took a pre-booked tour which lasted around an hour. It is also worth buying the guidebook which explains more about the science and history of the observatory."
Interesting but 'not my cup of tea',"A set of 19 massive astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II.  It is a very educational site, as each piece is unique and has its own purpose such as measuring time & predicting eclipses. There are not much shady area, be sure to wear a hat, put on sunblock, and bring a bottle of water."
Educational,"The most widely known astronomical sites in the world are the observatories of Maharaja sawai jai singh (1688-1743) of india . T he observatories with their monumental instruments, built in the early 18th century,have fascinated the scientists and layman alike more than 300 years. What  makes them fascinating that they were built in a day and age when astronomy had ceased to be medieval, and great strides had been made in devolopment in Europe.Newton already had published  in 1685 his PRINCIPIA which provided a solid basis for the theoritical aspect of celestial mechanics,In 1656,HUYGENS invented pendulum clock for accurate time keeping. John Flamsteed published  his  calibrated catalog of stars with unprecendented accuracy of + 10 of arc.micrometer and crosswire fitted telescopes were a common sight in observatories.      Jai singh, unware of devolopments in Europe. erected naked eye instuments of masonary and stone,in the tradition of medieval astronomers such as Ulugh Beg. Jai singh's instruments still exist at Jaipur, Delhi,Varanasi, and Ujjain."
Jantramantra,"It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal.The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye.The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy"
An Astrological Marvelous Place,Jantar Mantar is like an outdoor museum or observatory with a collection of a number of astrological instruments that was built in about 1734.  One of the instruments happens to be the largest stone sundial in the world.  The Jaipur Jantar Mantar has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  It is interesting to walk around this area and see the different types of instruments for telling time and/or the movement of the earth - interesting!
Astronomy & Astrology,These amazing creations were built for Sawai Jai Singh back in the mid 1700's and still work & function today. This site is the largest out of 5 that he had built ! He loved his star gazing I think ? A lot that I read & saw went over my head as maths was never my strong point…
An impressive collection of Astrological Instruments.,We included this as part of our guided tour of Jaipur.  At the last minute our guide rearranged our itinerary as the day we were due to go was very overcast.  You get most benefit from the sun dials when it is sunny!  It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and houses two large…
Unexpected interest,Jantar Mantar is an astronomical observatory used to measure the distances and positions of celestial objects. This monument was completed in 1734. It consists of 19 large instruments each serving a very specific purpose. The most significant among these is the Samrat Yantra…
Unlike anything I have seen before,My husband and I were glad we added this stop onto our list. It is a collection of huge astronomical instruments that make up this observatory. The size of the sundial alone was very impressive. Watch out for random people who will walk up to you and offer a tour - and then want…
An impressive collection of astrological instruments.,"A UNESCO World Heritage site, the site includes a large sundial, accurate to two seconds, and other 18th century astrological instruments.  This collection is impressive both for its demonstration of scientific knowledge at the time and also its construction."
glorious afternoon,"i did not know what to expect of this but really enjoyed the visit on the most beautiful afternoon, sky blue and such an interesting place to explore all laid out in a delightful way. There was a video in english explaining the background in the information centre and explanations on the exhibits themselves. All quite fascinating."
Excellent place,Jantar Mantar is an astronomical observatory used to measure the distances and positions of celestial objects.It has many  architectural astronomical instruments.It is UNESCO World Heritage site. We can see many unknown Mathematical and Scientific Collection.
For the budding astrologist,"An amazing collection of sundials under differing formats, and some linked to the zodiac. There are ""guides"" available for tour, however are very expensive. 250 rupee entry fee, and another 250 for the short tour. Take your time of birth also, and you'll get a ""reading"" of your attributes....LOL."
A great place to visit.,Jantar Mantar is a sort of a lab of the ancient astronomy scientists where various experiments were carried out. I was astounded to see the various things these great minds built to forecast astronomical events. I highly recommend to have a guide while visiting this monument. A must see for anyone visiting Jaipur.
Amazing place,This is an astonishing scientific piece of construction. It shows how measurement of time and seasons developed and has the biggest sun dial in the world that measures time to 2 second accuracy - not bad for a pile of stone work
Astronomy,"This place is heaven for lovers of astronomy and sundials.  The observatory has been in place for many years and contains some amzing pieces.  A sundial accurate to within two minutes, for example!  Great to do a tour with a guide as they will be able to explain in detail what…"
A True Marvel,Anyone interested in Astronomy  just has to spend time here and see and understand this amazing observatory. It's a one of a kind anywhere. It's all the more amazing considering it was build nearly 300 years ago. A Must see of Jaipur. Youngsters would do well to experience this…
Best city,Very good view and good for photographery and food also very good like the city as well people are very nice with tourists
For all you horoscope lovers,"This observatory is truly phenomenal. Answers of  questions about astronomy and astrology. Just the fact that this was invented 300 years ago with no up to date technology and skill , is what makes this even more fascinating. For  horoscope and astrology lovers.. make sure you…"
Group visit,We visited this on a group tour at the end of a long day.We had a guide explaining everything in addition to our own guide.Some people found it interesting however I didn't to be honest but that is purely a personal taste.I did appreciate how the various displays worked and the…
Proud of our Heritage,"We visited the place as one of the places of Tourism. It was an experience which can not be described in word's. It's an Engineering and Astronomical marvel from the ancient times. Anybody who is interested in our Civilization, must visit and spend a good amount of time. Make sure you have a good Guide."
Go with a guide who knows,This is a great place to go if you’re into science or astronomy but you really need a good guide who can explain what all the devices are.
Mind blowing,Truly mind blowing to think these instruments of astrological measurement were designed some 300 years ago and are still accurate. Fascinating place.
An interesting masonry observatory,These stone intruments from over 300 years ago were built on the inspiration of the young Maharaja Jai Singh who was passionate about astronomy. While it was fascinating to find out that a huge stone sundial could measure the accuracy of time to within 3 seconds in in all honesty became a bit bored with all the contraptions and went to find a place to sit in the sun while awaiting the rest of the group.
Even if you're not interested in astronomy this place is mind blowing!,"Sun dials have always interested me but seeing this collection of every size(some 5 feet tall up to as tall as a three story building), shape and style of object used to measure the earths movements is truly astounding. We did have a guide to explain each structure and how and what it measured with the earths movement so I""m not sure it would have been as informative on your own."
Marvel the ingenuity of old,"If you are interested in history, astrology, or anything that has to do with timekeeping, this is the place to visit. Then you will need a guide to take you through this amazing place. I could not help but marvel how the scientist of old could figure out all the contraption in…"
Just an amazing place,The Jantar Mantar was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who from a very young age was fascinated by the movement of the celestial objects.  He built five of these of which the one in Jaipur was the biggest.  The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur consists of 19 large instruments…
Feat of science,"Personally I found this to be quite interesting because I had a tour guide with me, who was able to explain what the different parts were and how they would have been used when first created. I do question how interesting I’d have found some of this without a guide. In any case,…"
Interesting ,Interesting for a quick look around with amazingly accurate sundials. Unless you have a particular interest in the history of time telling though it will not take too long to see. 
Great,Jantar mantar is jaipur one of the historic place for space lovers i totally loved the science items there
Jantar Mantar,the arts inside these buildings are breathtaking. real masterpieces. i would stare and admire them for hours. 
Amazing monument,"This place is amazing.  It is simply jaw dropping.  How could kings of olden days construct such civil structures in stone, marble and bricks with such accuracy.  Absolutely precise astronomical calculations with such huge structures! Their knowledge of astronomy is truly…"
Amazing,It was a very interesting and amazing to see how people in old time use these things to find time & solar syar
Astronomy and Astrology lovers dream site! ,"Very interesting. Especially if you’re a follower of astronomy or astrology. 19 fascinating astronomical instruments with the largest sundial in the world, it’s a UNESCO world heritage site. Quite fascinating. "
Boring+++++,This visit was part of our G Adventure golden triangle one week guided tour. You can only visit if you like astrology or astronomy. You need the sun to understand the demo but our day was extremely cloudy and dull. Our guide was like a physics or maths teacher giving us lesson…
Biggest Sundial in India,This is an observatory with the biggest sundial in India. Our guide explained in detail how each part of the observatory functioned and how the dials and timings worked.The astronomers in those days were so clever to work out how to read time and seasons as well as the zodiac.Worth a visit if you like science
Interesting to intriguing visit.,"Once more, please take a guide (at least an audio guide)! I paid about 25-30 €/USD for 4-5 hours and several monuments, not more, and it give not only valuable info but also spares time at ticket offices, ...This observatory looks attractive but you need the sun (what we missed), some time, and preferable some basic info about astrology (what I miss...) rather then of astronomy."
Ancient scientific place,"We visited this place with kids, as they had learnt about Jantar mantar in school books. we wanted to experience first hand, how in olden days they used to calculate time using sunlight. Good informative and learning center for all public."
A good place to visit in Jaipur,If you're from other city..then this should be in your bucket list when you are planning to go Jaipur.You should also visit City Place which near to this place.
Informative,If you are a science student its a must to visit place in Jaipur. Quite informative and really amazing science. Take a guide to understand.
Great place to visit and see ancient systems,"Fasciniting visit to the place, a guide is a must as he/she will walk you through wih various system. It is built with seconds precision, where based on Sun and Moon movement, one can check the time and predict the horroscope."
Wonderful outdoor astronomy and sculpture park,A must see for anyone who loves science and art.  Built in 1726 this is a beautiful display of both abstract  sculpture and accurate astronomy measuring devices.  A remarkable synthesis of art and science
Quirky,If I hadn’t been told that it was an observatory I would have guessed that it was a sculpture park. The site houses a series (19) of architectural astronomical instruments built by Maratha Raipur King Sawai Jai Singh II. These were completed in 1734. When their functions are explained they make sense but don’t ask me to repeat the explanation.Most visitors seemed to be somewhat bemused.As it’s located in the centre of Jaipur then it’s worth a visit whilst you are there.
Incredible,A most incredible place  to visit as we had a friendly guide .Nice to know about old way of calculating time.
"Do not miss seeing this absolutely amazing astronomical observatory, next to the City Palace!!!  Get someone to explain.","This place is unbelievable!  It is amazing how it was designed, and constructed - and with such accuracy.  You need to find someone to explain it to you.  It is really worth your time!Prepare to be astonished!Don't miss seeing this!"
Stunning scientific observatory!,This place is a large solar observatory with massive tools to accurately read the time. Jantar Mantar proves the scientific astronomical prowess of the great Rajasthani Maharajahs!It’s a must visit place!
Very Observational,Incredible sundials and quite a Park. Well worth a visit. Loved all the cool displays   Early science is fascinating for sure
OK,To make any sense of it you will need a guide to explain how each part works.I personally found it boring and would have preferred to opt out of this tour.Very popular with the locals as they put a huge influence on their astrological readings when entering into arranged marriages.
good place to visit,"its one the unique place to visit there is a BIG sun dial and apart from sun dial there are many other observatory instruments works on sun,air and wind directions are available there"
Top interesting attraction in Jaipur,"This is an observatory built in 1727 by the king number 2 who was an astronomer and scientist . This site consists of sun dial watches that can calculate the exact time very accurately, 12 zodiac signed with an accurate instrument that calculates which should be used at the specific day , and a North Star observatory. Just amazing"
Knowledge Based,This is an amazing place to explore the Jyotish vidhya. For first time visitor it is must to have a Guide accompanied during visit..
Smart Watch of India.,"A place to remember. Jantar is one of the several tourist attractions of Rajasthan. Entry fee is reasonable and for students it is free if they provide their student identity cards. Structures built to make astronomical calculations without the use of any equipment, Jantar…"
Jantar Mantar,Jantar Mantar is a form of an observatory located very close to the city palace.  There are giant sculptures that were reportedly built to measure the heavens.  If you are interested in the details regarding how each instrument works you will need to hire a guide.
Unique Place in the World,World Heritage Site. Your tour wont get complete without visit to JANTAR MAHAR. about 300 Years old Observatory. Created by Royals of JAIPUR
Interesting if Science Background,"went with my partner in February. It's very beautiful and the the complexity of these seemingly simple structures is astounding, however, someone with a science background would definitely get more out of it. There are descriptions next to each astrological tool for how it…"
Come early and have a good guide,This is all about being early when you are more or less alone in the area. It makes sense to have a guide t explain what you are seeing. Sunprotection is a must even though the whole thing is about seeing shadows. Highly impressive to see how this large observatorium is working and what it can show you.
Interesting observatory,This place was very educational. Plenty to learn about special since all of it was built in the 1700'sLargest sun dial in the world.Great astrological observatory.
Must visit for Science Enthusiasts,Its an amazing place for Science enthusiasts. Can't image that this was built 100s of years ago by a King! So much of detail has been taken into account. But do not expect that you can try out any of the science experiments (Except for a very few) as you do in any other science centers in India. This is only for seeing the instruments and information about it. Still its worth visiting.This place hosts the worlds largest sun dial with such a precision! Must experience.Read about the place and instruments in the place before you go or take a guide to get a most out of your visit. You can skip this place if you don't have any interest in science.
Most see,This is a must see in India. I knew nothing about astrology but this peaked my interest. These people were very smart
Fascinating experience,For someone who has never had any interest in astronomy or astrology this was absolutely fascinating - our guide Vivek - I only wish he’d taught me at school as it’s the first time I’ve ever understood it!
Takes you back in time,A must visit in Jaipur. Entry fee is 50 Rs for Indian tourists. Kids less than 7 yrs of age can visit free. Lots of astronomical instruments with lots of history involved. Nice open space. A touring guide is must for this attraction as there is lot of technicality involved.
Booooring 😂,Unless you are into knowing things about sun/ hour/ latitude and stuff like that then avoid. Quite boring but gardens are well maintained so if you already paid you can at least have a nice walk around...
Fascinating Astronomical Site,This astronomical observatory is absolutely fascinating. It’s hard to understand how they were able to create these huge structures telling time and more down to the second. Not to be missed. 
Must visit,Very impressive. Do take a guided tour to truly understand how incredible this place really is. The sundial and various other instruments that were built centuries ago and work with accuracy will date. A delight for science and astronomy enthusiasts.  It is within walking…
The World's Largest Stone Sundial.,"Our last stop of the day, was at the open-air Jantar Mantar Observatory to see the vast astronomical instruments from 1734. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring the world's largest stone sundial. Amazing minds !"
What a time piece ,"Visited yesterday via our booking with the travel agents. We were taken back by all the instruments, their size, how accurate they were and still working.  What a gem."
Astrological Park,An astrological park near to the City Palace with loads of weird shaped stone structures. Very unusual and worth a visit. Not very large and can be seen in less than one hour.
Must see. It’s amazing. ,You only need an hour. It’s really nice. Amazing technology especially all those years ago. What a clever man. Brilliant. 
A must visit place for the geeky travellers,This is my second visit to this place.. my neices absolutely loved it... it is amazing how our ancestors studied astronomy!!
Science and Surrealism at the same time,"The Jantar Mantar is an eighteenth-century observatory, where astronomy holds hands with astrology.  The setting looks lime something from a surrealist film, but the science is very real indeed.  It requires a very good guide or guidebook to understand the various ""scientific…"
Incredibly surreal experience,When you visit Jantar Mantar it is difficult to believe that it was constructed in 1734!! The shapes of the buildings and the structures used to measure astronomical entities are not only mind blowing but accurate enough to still be used today! Awesome
Fascinating!,"These fascinating exhibits showing the significant celestial knowledge even if some “knowledge” is astrology.  As we have mentioned in many reviews of sites in India, a guide is helpful, though unlike some sites, there are quite a few informative signs at the instruments but having someone demonstrate the operation of them adds substance to the experience."
Part of our Wendy Wu tour,A most interesting place to visit particularly as we had a very friendly knowledgeable guide. Very interesting instruments in the observatory. A must to visit.
Don't waste money on a guide,"Jantar Mantar really is fascinating and interesting for anyone who has an interest in science. Even if you don't, enjoy the beauty in the precision, curves and lines of the large scale astronomical instruments. We took a guide for 300Rs and it lasted only about 20 minutes. He was a little impatient (probably in a hurry to make more money from the next group of tourists!) and had a rude attitude too. Find the museum, where you can watch a film that explains things well, and the exhibits also does a good job explaining what the instruments are all about. You can use the 300Rs instead to buy a good publication in the bookshop about Jantar Mantar. Go early to avoid large crowds."
Nothing special,"The Jantar Mantar is a collection of concrete structures that were used to learn more about space. There is nothing truly stunning or special here, although it’s not too bad of a way to spend an hour or so. This is missable if you have limited time in Jaipur."
Mind Blown ,"Not only are the structures varied and beautiful, they are a mathematical tour de force. The only way to fully appreciate what was created here is to engage a knowledgeable in house guide who will walk you around and explain the precision of the structures, each of which is a…"
Get a guide ,Worth going but I think time spent doing something else is better. It is well kept the toilets clean 
"Selfie by the ""World's Largest Sundial""","A very very fascinating place to visit even if you are not the interested in astronomy. Best seen with a guide. You can at least look geeky in your photos if you take a selfie by the Samrat Yantra, which is the ""World's Largest Sundial"" <3"
Amazing accuracy based on the mathematics of time and space,"Developed in the 1700s by a ruler with an interest in astronomy, this amazing set of apparatus can (and could nearly 300 years ago) tell the time at the location with great accuracy to the minute.  Good knowledgeable guide. Nice grounds. Green grass. Places to sit."
ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY POPULARLY KNOWN AS JANTAR MANTAR WAS BUILT BY MAHARAJA SAWAI JAI SINGH IN THE YEAR 1727 AND I,Jantar mantar or astronomical observatory built by sawai jai singh is a perfect place to study the principles of meta physics and when you are there take some astrophysicist with you so that you may be able to understand better. It is a perfect place to know the movemnt of…
Historically very interesting - if you are interested in time.,A fantastic site that explains the historical study of time and the stars. Take time to read all of the explanations - and maybe do some homework first. :-)  Really fascinating!
A must,"  This was the most interesting visit in Jaipur, has English explanations as well as Hindi. A must I feel.  Child friendly if you are really interested it's good to pay for a guide for the info. "
Hire a local guide here and spend atleast 2 hours.,"Ideal time to visit this place is between 2pm to 5pm, in clear sunlight. Hire a local guide here to understand these historical astrological tools."
Astonished,My lad was astonished once he got his head around what it was he was looking at.  The brilliant technical skills and the beautiful instruments in a calm garden environment are wonderful.
Get a guide and worth it,This place is wonderful to visit with young children and awe inspiring to see the Indian astronomy was practiced in old days  Definitely a guide is must as the plaques aren't enough to convey the meaning of the structures  The guide charges are nearly written and unlike many…
Unique and Science enthusiastic,"It is nice place to visit who are science enthusiastic as it describes about the solar system, gravitational forces etc."
Unique and original,"when clock was not invented? when europe was trying to find answers how solar eclipse happens or how moon eclipse happen? we indians are finding another earth in space.Go to jantar mantar if you want to see how indians calculate time, calculate solar or moon eclipse time. sawai jaisingh the one of the best king of Amer(Jaipur) built jantar mantar at three place of india. one is in jaipur, one is in delhi and one is in agra.go and enjoy"
Average,"We visited Agra,Jaipur,Udaipur,Delhi  with my family (wife and 2 kids) in Christmas 2019 holidays and so visited this attraction during our stay in Jaipur.Nice to know old way of calculating time though we know its now out-dated technique.BTW,Jaipur as such is not a neat town with heavy traffic and hardly people putting helmets while driving. Atleast this is my observation."
Visit,For indian nationality adult ticket is 50 rs per person.5 years old kids are free.and students id get have discount for entry tickets.
Worth Having A knowledgeable Guide,"A very interesting place to visit, especially if you have an interest in navigation and the concept of time over the ages.  Reasonably quiet and tranquil."
Good and nice.,"A amazing place to see jantar mantar. honestly, I was blown away with how things worked the past - this is complex science and engineering demonstrated in the simplest from we have no shame in giving credit to an iPhone because of it's simplicity of use inspire of the…"
So interesting,This is a must see site! Who would have ever thought that we would find an astronomical observatory from the 18th century in Jaipur.  It did help that we had a guide to explain it all to us!
Jaipur,"The best way to visit Jaipur, and its Jantar Mantar, is to have a guide who knows astronomy: Thakur Swaroop Japat. I met Thakur Swaroop Jopat in Jaipur during my first travel in India from 26 December 2019 to 06 January 2020. He was our guide and what a guide!!! He is very kind…"
Why these immense devices in the telescopes' era?,"This observatory is, in my view, one of the most extraordinary experiences that can be had in India. A space dotted with tools, basically built of stone, massive or even gigantic, aimed at exploring the celestial vault and its bodies, measuring them, locating them. And we know…"
Marvelous!,Jantar Mantar is located just 5 minutes walking distance away from City Palace. It is the largest astronomical observatory in India. It contains different instruments which were used in the past for astrology purposes. One can't help but marvel at the interest of the King in…
Must for astronomers ,"As a physicist I enjoyed this place tremendously. It's probably not for everyone though. I also had a local guide,  which probably helped. "
An amazing old architect,This is an amazing architect build in Mughal era in India. Good to learn about the advance knowledge the people have those days.
Family trip to India,We really enjoyed our visit to the Jantar Mantar. It was really enhanced by a guide who knew what the various instruments were for and how they worked. We were probably here for an hour or more which was sufficient but a fascinating place for anyone with an interest in astronomy…
Probably nicer out of a monsoon,"Decidedly average attraction, although we did go in the middle of a monsoon downpour, which probably clouded our view somewhat. 200INR per foreigner adult entry."
Jantar Mantar,"Jantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the kachwaha Rajput king sawai jai singh II, the founder of Jaipur. The monument was completed in 1743. It features the world's largest stone sunidal and is a UNESCO world heritage site. I…"
Testimony to astronomical traditions,"After the City Palace, we visited the Jantar Mantar. It's the astronomical skill of Jai Singh II at display. The innovative architectural instruments are designed to observe astronomical positions with the naked eye.  It's quite pointless to come here without a guide as you…"
Science Geek's Heaven,"Jantar Mantar is an amazing place to visit. Whether you love science or not, this place offers something for everyone.  "
Ancient India is Amazing,"Honestly I didn't know about this place until my driver just dropped me at the gate. He insisted that I got in and I was not disappointed at all. If you look from normal distance for looking at things, you'd only see white/ivory constructions. One of the first thing that took my…"
Guide is must,It's a great experience to know how intelligent people created devices.  The time and gps calculation up to accuracy of 2 minutes and 2 degree.  Take a guide to know the exact working of each devices and it worth.  Otherwise you will be wasting time by reading the explanation..
Good one this,A great place to see the depth of understanding that our ancestors had on science. Very close to the city palace and well worth the visit.
Worth the time!,"Honestly, I was blown away with how things worked in the past - this is complex science and engineering demonstrated in the simplest form. We have no shame in giving credit to an iPhone because of its simplicity of use inspire of the complexities in the backend - then why can’t…"
Jantar Mantar.. Amazing India,"Nice place. Jantar means instrument and Mantar means calculation. There are several instruments here made to calculate the date, time, horoscope of a newborn and predict the seasons in ancient times just by looking at the sun's shadow on the instruments. The instruments here can…"
Don't go without guide,Nothing special if you have already seen in delhi or other place.. Otherwise please go with guide.. Without guide you will not understand anything
Astrology Review,"The shapes of the structures kept the children interested, the cameraman happy but not really worth visiting."
Wonderful place,Loved the place. It is well maintained and beautiful. You can actually check current time. This surprised me most
visit if interested in astronomy,"visited here as we didnt get time in Delhi. maintained very well and guards are present at all points. if you are interested in astronomy, then it is worthy visit. but otherwise also a good visit and can take some good photos."
Interesting display - makes more sense if you are into astronomy,Touring the Jaipur Jantar Mantar was an optional tour of our tour group. We chose to attend all of the optional tours (except the dinners) because we might not attend those cities / sites again in the future.  Our tour guide tried to explain the displays and how they were…
Fascinating Ancient Observatory,"This place is astonishing. Upon entering it appears to be a modern sculpture park. It is, in fact and ancient observatory with a number of working structures that, amongst other things, include a sun dial that tells the time with an accuracy of 2 seconds. Quite astonishing! A…"
Surreal and unique landscape,"Ticket window has an Indian queue (long) and a foreigner queue (short). Unfair yes, but foreigners pay a lot more to enter. 2 adults and 2 kids was 300 rupees.  Inside get a guide, cost is another 300 rupees for up to 4 people. Our guide showed us the instruments for around 20…"
Visiting Jaipur with children,If you r visiting Jaipur with children . To avoid rush at ticket window book tickets online.  And don’t forget to take students school/college ID CARD for consesionnal tickets
Interesting site,"Interesting location, better understood with a guide.When I visited it was crowded with Indian and foreign tourists."
"Worth a visit, but confirm extent of guide first!","Interesting place and real relief from the city noise as you can chill in the gardens as long as you want. Get a guide, but confirm that they will show you all the instruments and how long as our guy obviously wanted to get his lunch!Also don’t wait for long I’ll cals queue, v. Short foreigner queue. Do this above the city palace which is pretty bang average"
Must see for Astronomy enthusiasts,"This place is near City Palace.. an amazing historical observatory.. Astronomy enthusiasts would definitely love this place.. Lot of instruments like Sundial etc were there which were used to measure the position of various planets, sun etc.. Each instrument requires time to understand.. Taking a guide would be a better thing if someone have no idea on astronomy.."
Proud that we had such researchers   400 years back  onwards  ,We visited yesterday. Due to the vacation time it was bit crowded.Tickets were available just outside itself. Worth watching if you are a person who like to learn on celestial details.
Centre for astrological studies,"Jantar mantar is a historical observatory with various instruments which can used to calculate time, position of sun, planets and others heavenly bodies. If you want to really enjoy vising the place, take the help of a experienced and knowledgeable guide. One who can explain you the function and importance of each of the instrument. Must visit, but with an experienced guide."
Impressive and interesting ,Had been to the Jantar Mantar in Delhi but the one here certainly surpasses it easily. You need a guide (or hire one on the spot) otherwise you just look at strange constructions that actually don’t mean a thing. Wonderful to see how they worked and of course to find the instrument that is used for your zodiac sign. Oh and the largest sundial of the world is there as well!
Need Guide,"This is an observatory without much information on display. Therefore, one has to depend on guide to understand everything. The place is amazing and worth visiting with a guide."
Good place,One should definitely come here if they are in Jaipur . I and my kids liked it . Its an interesting place . Got to learn many things from here .
Great insight into Maharaja’s mind,"You see forts and palaces everywhere with one ruler trying to outdo each other w variation on the same theme, so when u see the fruits of labour of someone seem so focused on knowledge and educating others, it is truly amazing.  The time devoted to coming up with such instruments was inspiring, definitely worth a visit, a ruler who can be focused on such matters is definitely a wise and impressive one."
Garden Observatory.,One of the must-see in Jaipur.Local guide would be helpful for people with interest in Astronomy.Not much information on display at JM.
A timepiece of a different era,"Built by the multi faceted and short lived Maharaja of Jaipur, the stone / masonry complex houses complex instruments constructed with marble and stone to accurately reflect the planetary movements and local time.  A must see while you are in Jaipur, the place needs cleaning up…"
Amazing Observatory in Jaipur,"An interesting observation park in Jaipur, with large sun dials that display time with extreme accuracy.  Between 1724 and 1730 Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five astronomical observatories in north India. The observatories, or ""Jantar Mantars"" as they are…"
Must see,This is the unique place worth visiting while in Jaipur. One should not hurry and take time to see and understand the creativity involving scientific knowledge.  
unique experience !,located right across city palace.  unique one of a kind place - structures are truly amazing (considering the time they were built) in that they are still relevant to modern times. for those into astronomy this place is a delight.  a guide might be useful for those looking to…
An Observatory,"Built in 1718, the great Maharaja thought of constructing an observatory so he can study on the subject of Astronomy. His helper spoke several languages and this helped him concentrate on his studies. Though it was done on experimental measures, after it was built, he…"
Observatory worth visiting,Jantar Mantar is near the city palace of Jaipur. You can park your vehicle in the palace parking area and take a walk near by to enter Jantar Mantar. Must visit place with small entrance fee. Please take a guide around to explain otherwise you would not know anything about the…
Best visit of Jaipur,"A must see, the structures are mesmerising and mind-boggling. Fully recommend hiring a guide on arrival. They are very informative and helpful, without a guide it's hard to understand and appreciate the intelligence of the structures. Very well preserved site. If you have seen…"
Fascinating working observatory,"If you are doing the classic India tour you are likely to see a few Jantar Mantars. Take it from me, this is the one to see. It is perfectly preserved and in full working order.  That means that they have been taking readings and timings with pinpoint accuracy for the last 300…"
Amazing technique used ,The construction and technology used three hundred years ago is really mind boggling. Must take a local guide to know the details of each construction and purpose of the same. 
Best place for history lovers...,Here u can check the science that we had in ancient india....it is better to go...in evening...beautiful place for those who wants to discover glory of india
Interesting ,"We visited this place on a weekday after midday. The place has different structures that show how they used to read the time and other things in the past.Although it is interesting, I would prefer to have an audiovisual reference next to each device to have a better idea on how the devices used to work (as the devices are not currently working while on display)."
Nothing,"Very small place, nothing really interesting, very simple, very few constructions. You can skip it. Tickets not adequate, what you will see inside."
Unique Monument,"This is an unique, historical monument. Science at the age of beliefs. The architecture is also quite remarkable"
Jantar Mantar - Jaipur - finest ancient celestial measuring tools.,"This was constructed by Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur who is also the founder of Jaipur in 18th Century . The observatories, or ""Jantar Mantars"" as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple unique buildings , each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement. These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale. It draws attention of architects, artists, and art historians world wide, yet remain largely unknown to the general public.To understand each gigantic instruments and its functions one need to have good knowledgeable guide else one will see some structure and its essence will not be understood properly .This is connected with Jaypur city palace . And entry fee is little higher side. If you have interest in planetary movements and how it is calculated centuries ago then you MUST visit this place."
Educational Trip to Jaipur,It was worth to see if you have good guide with you. We are blessed we have guide Mahesh sir.  I post pic of Mahesh sir for Jaipur travelling.
The Devices are amazing,All the structures are created with sun as reference. You will be able to enjoy this place if you can understanding the devices. For that you would need a guide or need to do some literature search. Some devices are complex and would need a good guide. Tour guide will rush you through but ensure you visit it again at leisure to appreciate understanding of science centuries ago.
"Without going to Jaipur, can't say you've been to India 자이푸르를 가봐야 인도를 간 것이다","잔타르 만타르(Jantar Mantar)는 고대 천문우주 점성 기술이 집약된 곳으로 천문 관측시설과 해시계 등이 즐비한, 말하자면 우리나라 첨성대(Cheumsungdae 占星臺) 같은 곳이다. 잔타르만타르의 유적지 관리는 인상적이다. 인도 관광지 중에서 가장 관리 유지가 잘되고 있는 듯 티끌 하나 없이 깨끗하다. 1728부터 1734년 사이 수학자·천문학자였던 자이싱 2세(Jai Singh II)가 자하푸르에 세운 석조 천문 관측소로 2010년 유네스코에 의해 세계문화유산으로 등재되었다고 gks다. 잔타르 만타르(Jantar Mantar)는 산스크리트어로 ‘마법의 장치(Magical Device)’라는 의미이며. 델리, 우자인, 바라나시, 마투라, 자이푸르에 세워졌으며, 그중 가장 규모가 큰 자이푸르의 잔타르 만타르는 1940년대까지도 천문대로 이용되었고, 1948년 국가기념물로 지정되었다고 합니다."
Very interesting exhibits of Indian brain power,Very interesting exhibits of complex sundials for telling the time very accurately. Our guide explained the way it calculates time with extreme precision. You need a good local guide to explain the exhibits and the calculations. This is a UNESCO Heritage site and well worth the visit.
"Historical importance, but price is steep for looking at some non-functioning structures","The Jantar Mantar is a structure from the 18th century used for calculating both time and the position of celestial objects. Technology has since moved on , but we can still admire what the people in the past did for science. The price is steep for looking at some non-functioning structures though, but I’ll leave it up to you to decide how badly you want to see these."
Jantar Mantar,"- Jantar Mantar and City Palace are situated at same place, just across the road.- There is a ticket of 50/- per person.- I would suggest to directly go to interpretation center where they will tell you about the structures and their significance with an Audio visual tape. It will help to better understand the things on ground.- Else you can do a guide as well.- There are number of things which are placed scientificaly by the local king(s). It was such a proud moment to watch those traditionnal equipments and inventions of Indian kings to explore in the area of Astronomy in that age.- It was a nice experiance."
Scientific Architecture,The complex has architectural structures scatters all over which act as a natural time clock with the help of the movement of the sun and its shadow. A unique structure to see.
Unique,A large collection of stone constructions which demonstrate the skill of the stone masons and the interest level in astrology.It looks at first glance like a modern sculpture and can actually be enjoyed as such.The guide tried to explain it too us but it is not easy to fully understand the science behind it.Not something you see every day though.
Jantar Mantar a perfect monument showing intellectual past of India,"Jantar Mantar a perfect monument showing intellectual past of India, wherein the Physics and Astrophysics concepts were very well developed. It's a must-visit for School Children studying 8-12-graduation standards to understand our past."
Captivating observatory,"It is one of the biggest of all the Jantar Mantar's in India. On first sight it seems a place with huge weird constructions but on going near them and reading about them it leaves one speechless. Do hire a guide to get the proper information about each and every yantra. It is basically a sundial used to measure time ,correct to half a second. It was constructed to predict the times and movements of the sun, Moon and other planets. People with interest in astronomy and astrology will really enjoy this place. The entry fees is also minimal with student discount available."
Amazed,"Yes initially you will not understand what is this all about. But there is small auditorium, where small presentation/ show for 15 min is arranged. It is recommended to first attend the show and then view the place for better understanding. Also one may hire professional guide"
Architectural Wonder,Jantar Mantar houses nineteen architectural astronomical instruments which helps in various calculations. Its part of UNESCO world heritage site. This place is located near Hawa mahal or city palace and usually is crowded in tourist season.  you should keep a couple of hours for…
Was not expecting this!,Had not really given this too much thought as thought it was an observatory!  It is - but how different from what my perception of an observatory is!  Would recommend a guide for this visit as it is a complex collection of structures.  Interesting to know they still use it today…
Fascinating but a professional guide is a must ,If you don’t have a professional guide it could be highly likely that you will not understand what on earth you’re looking at !  Built around 1724 and is one of the 5 such astronomical wonders constructed by Sawai Jai Singh. This observatory is still operational today displaying…
Good ,You will be amazed at the monumental astronomical instruments and the simplicity through which they are designed to provide astronomical insights even with the naked eye.  It is a beautifully maintained .  It includes many different devices that were used to measure time in…
Jantar Mantar ,"Mind boggling ,Simply amazing Its a must see when in Jaipur .First visit the interpretation center for a small documentary.and exhibition of miniature of all instruments kept .If you want to understand the detailed explanation then hire a guide . "
Amazing,One has to prepared properly or hire a good guide before visiting this place. The place is amazing for the people who wants knowlege about astronomical instruments of the past. Nominal ticket cost is worth paying. Parking is available in plenty.
Okay,"Probably felt a bit tired this day, it did not really capture my imagination at all. However I think others found it interesting. It was quite busy."
Logical,"It's good place to reach easily, i have taken  300rs ticket from the Alberto Museum itself, so it was easy to get in, It's a place ther v can know about the solar system used by our ancestors"
Fascinating ,I was annoyed with myself that I hadn't read up about it more intensively before my all too brief visit. I could have spent days there examining the exhibits in more detail. 
Amazing place with a proper guide,"If you didn’t have a guide you would wander around not quite knowing what was on display. But with a guide who was able to explain everything, it was amazing. Essentially it’s a museum of lots of different observatory artefacts. It has the largest sundial in the world (accurate…"
Beautiful ,Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is so big you can get lost! A lot of history too.
Fascinating site,A fascinating observatory with a number of structures built with extreme precision to make astronomical measurements - particularly of time.
Loved it!,"If you are a science lover (or even if you are not) ,this place is magical. I loved the whole concept and I'm in awe of the intellect of our ancestors. The clock is placed in such a way that it shows the exact time, with the help of sun rays shadow. It also shows the 'raashi' the horoscope, the eclipse. We didn't ake a guide, the place was self explanatory. It's well maintained (compared to the rest of jaipur)"
Ancient observatory,The ancient observatory is always of interest. See and be surprised. It’s always better to see for yourself.
Classical Architecture,"The Jantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments which was used for specifying positions of satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. It consists of nineteen instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking location of major stars as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes.The monument is well maintained by authorities."
Jantar mantar,"Nice place to visit to know how advanced our earlier generations were looking at the technology that used ages back,it’s a must visit.."
"""Instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens""","The Jantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Kachwaha Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, in 1724....eye opening, jaw dropping and brow raising. Amazingly all the instruments are still operational. Its…"
Largest sun dial,"Next to city palace, Jantar Mantar is located. The rulers of Jaipur patronised astronomy and astrology. To keep track of stars, first small prototype of models were prepared and then big size models were prepared. Such Jantar Mantar were constructed in other cities like Ujjain,…"
really need a guide for this one,"A trip back in time for astronomy and astrology- which didn't seem to separate back then. having it explained is crucial.  However, well maintained, clean safe. and very interesting"
Natural Astrological place,Study of astrology through suns rays and other techniques is quiet helpful to people interested. School for such courses are being held here. An astrology report is considered to be taking nearby 2 months to be completed in detail
Worth a visit,"An amazing and unique facility in Jaipur.  I'd definitely recommend touring with one of the highly knowledgeable guides who can explain each of the pieces of equipment.  The accuracy of the time- keeping is astonishing, especially when you consider how long ago it was built."
Interesting Observatory ,"I took a day tour of Jaipur with Royal Majestic Tours booked through Viator.com. I had a truly excellent and knowledgeable guide. One of the places we visited was the observatory, Jantar Mantar. The history behind the building of the place by a king who was interested in…"
Fascinating but didn’t really understand it.,"Should have read up on it before visiting, at first glance appears to be just a load of stone statues but it is an early example of an observatory. Each piece predicts the movement of the stars and eclipses, so if you’re into astronomy then this is the place for you. "
Really interesting,"Great way to spend an hour. This site is unique. It explores the equipment constructed by the ruler to get accurate time, and to create horoscopes by accurately tracking the stars. You need a good guide who knows about maths and astronomy to get the fill wonder of these…"
Very interesting but best with a guide,"An area in the centre of the city with lots of astronomy and astrology history including the very accurate sundial and the instrument to predict the date by shadows.  Incredible history and so accurate, however you really need somebody to explain what the devices are, how to use…"
Fascinating,"I'm not sure how someone could say that this place was boring. If you enjoy learning about astronomy and astrology through the ages, this place is very cool. Amazing to know how old many of these sundials, etc., are. Spending about an hour is good, or 1-2 hours if you have the…"
Jantar Mantar 🌟 ,Such a dreamy place! Choose the time you go wisely as even on a Saturday it was full of school groups. Definitely watch the film so that you have a better idea about the ‘tools’. 
Jaipur diaries,"The image I had in my mind and the reality is totally different.it is hard to believe that centuries back they have made these instruments,they are too good.it is a must visit place when in jaipur"
Pretty boring TBH,"Is not great tbh, Probably can look around in 10 minutes but is just R200, so not the end of the world. Make sure you keep your tickets for all attractions as they will ask to see them again at exit. "
Interesting place,We spent 40 mins here listening to a guide. Really enjoyed it but not sure I would if we didn't have some one explaining what all the building where used for and how they worked.
Fascinating place to bisit,The scale and magnitude of these instruments is astounding! Considering how long ago they were created is really amazing. It’s best to have a guide for this monument so they can really explain how these amazing instruments work. Definitely worth a visit. 
Most amazing and unexpected,"For the scientist in you and everyone else too.  If you think of how long ago this was built and the magnitude of it's offerings, it is astounding"
Different kind of monument,"It was a refreshing visit to this astronomical observatory: each measurement instrument is made in a large scale, thus make it different. And the entrance was much more affordable than those to other monuments: 200INR/foreigner. I recomend a visit, it is an opportunity for a…"
a peek into ancient indian scientific genius,"great place ... take a guide though .. they help .. i could see guides taking tours in english, japanese , french ...so i am sure whatever your nationality you will get a guide in your language. great and ingenious instruments and really leaves us awestruck ... be equipped with…"
interesting visit,"Our visit to the Jantar Mantar would have been more enjoyable if we had a tour guide.  There were plenty of interesting exhibits and architecture to observe but we didn't know what it meant or the history which seemed to detract from our visit.  However, this place is proof…"
An amazing mix of science and art in a beautiful place.,"This 'sculpture' garden contains many large scientific instruments used to tell the date, the time and the movements of the planets.  Not only are they incredibly accurate scientific instruments but also great works of architecture and sculpture too.  An amazing experience.…"
worth a quick look,"we went on a nice hot day so we got a bit of sun, the Janta Mantar is mainly time measuering devices from Indian history, there are some interesting objects to see but some are the same but different sizes."
Jantar Mantar- A living proof of India ancient science,"It was a beautiful winter noon, the sun was hot but not that harsh. We encountered rush at city palace. The jantar Mantar- was just adjacent. We decided to see the same in interest of time. And man what a miracle it is! Just can't believe that 2 century ago a Maharaja could pull…"
Fasinating,The fact that this Jantar Mantar astronomical instrument site was completed in 1734 makes it that more interesting of  the knowledge that was a available at that time.First i recommend that you get a guide to show you around the site otherwise you will not have clue of what or…
Not so interesting ,"We visit the main attractions in downtown and this one was also near by, entry was 200 rupees per person it’s not really expensive but if I know how was inside I didn’t went there, it its nice but not what I expected, there is another places more  traditional and that worth more…"
Jaipur trip,Amazing place if you are intersted in science. Its an architectural marvel to show the techniques during that time. Lots of rush due to holiday period. Must to attend 5 min information show there
A stimulating visit,"The Jantar Mantar takes an hour to go through, but at the end of it leaves you in awe of the technologically advanced know-how and the quality of construction to have survived the past two centuries and the millions of tourists that have visited it. It is recommended that the…"
Not what i expect,The place was definitely something poor in terms of the structure since have cost I was really expecting something with more visual value because in India everything has an amazing architecture. This place from my personal point of view is more like a multiple scratchs of drafts…
Amazing scientific achievement!,"Wow, what a complex and amazing scientific instrument, and built so long ago. You really do need a guide to explain how it all works. Very worthwhile to visit!"
Super duper brilliance,India is a truly great country and am sure had lot of scientific bent of mind as is seen from the Jantar Mantar . A truly marvelous structure of science relevant even today.. bow down to Maharaja Jai Singh the creator of Jaipur and the Jantar Mantar.. the various types of clocks…
Fascinating.,It was a superb experience made even better by the guide (taken after entry) who explained everything well. I was also proud to see that local guides were able to offer multiple language options (all proficiently).Fun fact: the worlds largest sun dial is in this jantar mantar with an accuracy of 2 seconds.
Very I nteresting ,"Highly recommend getting a guide to better understand, we’d of been clueless without 😂Unfortunately it wasn’t sunny and couldn’t test it, but apparently they have the largest sun dial in the world accurate to 2 seconds!"
Visit to Jantar Mantar,The visit to Jantar Mantar was nice and informative. The details of the differentaspects of the Jantar Mantar is interesting. The place is a good tourist spot.
Informative and Educating,An array of astronomical equipments are on display inside the park. Public washrooms are available and can be used for free.
Super interesting ,Great place. Super interesting . Gets the grey matter working. The kids were really intrigued by the whole complex. Great for young and less young scientific brains.
Intriguing ....,"Not a huge site, but packed full of interesting instruments used hundreds of years ago to tell time, track astral bodies etc. A site specific guide is probably a good idea, our general guide who had been with us visiting several sites in Jaipur, had limited knowledge, so I think we missed out on quite a bit.However, was interesting to have a wonder around the site and glean what information we could - we were able to verify that the giant sundial was pretty much on the button time-wise. Definitely worth a visit."
What time is it,Didn’t know what to expect from this place and I throughly enjoyed it. I was amazed at how accurate they were.
Fascinating observatory ,"The kids were really engaged with the attraction,  they are into science and astronomy, but it does require a guide to really bring the instruments to life by explaining their function. Well worth the price to get an insight on how these instruments work."
"Fascinating ""Observatory"" . ","The Jantar Mantar was an observatory in ancient times used for studying and charming the heavens. The ancient stone and metal instrument are enormous, and apparently very accurate. Among the instruments is the lardest sundial in the World, which they claim is exact up to 2 seconds !"
Astrological Heritage!,Jantar Mantar at Jaipur is a collection of several architectural astronomical instruments installed by the Rajpur King Sawai Jai Singh II during the eighteenth century. It has the world's largest Sundial and is a UNESCO world heritage site. It is a testimony of the technological advancements of the country during the earlier centuries. It is visited by numerous tourists visiting Jaipur and is a must visit.
Must see while in Jaipur.  A good guide is essential.,"Must see while in Jaipur.  A good guide is essential.  Historic, unique observatory with the world's largest sundial.  A gopd guide is essential to understand how earth of the observatory instruments work."
Jantar Mantar,Interesting place to spend an hour or so. Even if you aren’t interested in astronomy - the structures are amazing to see and everyone can relate to one - as there are individual ones for each star sign. Try to avoid the middle of the day when it is too hot as there is little…
Monumental astrological instruments,"Get there early it's in full sun! Since it's there to measure the sun and the stars... You do need a guide,for only 200 ruppees to understand how they work and to appreciate fully their creation. Several instruments were replicated at the time as aid for students. The sundial is…"
amazing place,One of the amazing place. remind us the way earlier people used to have a glimpse of our time and solar system without the current technology. how intelligent the people were at that time. A must visit place in jaipur
Unbelievable scientific instruments used hundreds of years ago!,The Jantar Mantar was built around 1723 and consists of 13 gigantic architectural astronomy instruments.  Well worth the visit.
Fortress History and culture.,There are about  nineteen architectural astronomical instruments in jantar mantar.It is famous for Monument Fort / Fortress History & Culture. It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal.The visiting time over there is 9 am to 5 pm.
Yay Science!,"Jantar Mantar was my favorite historical site in Jaipur.  While the forts, palaces, and temples are beautiful, the scientific nature behind this was a unique change of pace from the other sites in Rajasthan.  Seeing the structures in person was absolutely worth it!"
So many devices to see,"A very well kept attraction, beautifully displaying the time keeping methods used. Well worth a visit."
Really interesting ,"I must admit I didn’t think this place would really be my thing, but how wrong I was! It was so interesting that we stayed far longer than I thought we would. Well worth a visit."
Good place,"If interested in scientific topics this is a good place to visit. In the heart of the city in a sprawling space, good for a quick visit."
Great for a class in Astronomy,"Ancient structures built to measure time, solar positions, seasons, and other astronomical values. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a great visit for children and adults alike. Hire a guide to know how each of the instruments work. "
Amazing and accurate,I have been here a couple of times and love the place it is peaceful and the gardens are well kept. I like how it has a sundial for each of the 12 Zodiac signs.
Astronomy and observatory,Jantar Mantar is an ancient astronomy observatory by a Rajput King to know the time and movement of the sun and the moon. 
Inspiring Mahusive Stargazing Equipment ,A unique array of complex sundials and time pieces for reading the sky at day or night.  200rps per person bargain! 
Worth seeing if you have time,This place is worth seeing if you’re into astrology. It’s also close to a few other sites. The place is great just before sunset as the lighting is good for nice photos. 
Where Astrology and Astrophysics meet!,"One is simply amazed at how much our fore fathers knew about Astrophysics! And that will certainly put back some faith in Astrology! The huge, precise structures constructed in such an era when only the Westerners claimed knowledge of everything are relevant even today! They are not being used for the purpose, which seems wasted! But wow! Hats off to the king who commissioned it and a deep bow to the architect who made multiple such Jantar Mantars across the country!"
Unique attraction,"An unique outdoor observatory dating to 1728. A fascinating collection of astronomical calendars, sundials and other time pieces with incredible accuracy. It is best if you visit when the sun is shining and if you take time to understand the instruments, using a guide of your choice. If you don't understand how the instruments work, then you will miss a great deal, although they are also very eye-catching dramatic looking sculptures to photograph."
Climate and auspicious time calculation spot,Not easily understand anything here .. they made it for climate and auspicious time calculation .. we have know the facts earlier can allows you to understand this place .. surprise visit makes you bored .. already it is not for fun .. entry fee for this also not affordable one .. Govt should reduce the entry fee for it .. though they offered for combo
Photojournalist,Across the street from the city palace impressive tribute to an inquizzitive mind regarding our place in the universe. Beautiful image change and very interesting in the zodiac statues
Jantar Mantar,Fantastic and awe inspiring. One can imagine the level of development that we had even then. It feels as if we are standing in the middle of numbers with such deep meaning and calculations. Must visit if you come to Jaipur.
Ok ok ,"If you have guide with you than you will njoy this place..  But without guide you won't understand anything..  But you can skip this place.  Nothing is so special.  Not that great..  Instead u can spend your time at amber,  nahargarh or city palace"
Nothing for us,We bought our tickets for different places in Jaipur as a package and this place was included. Pretty interesting place but I wouldn't pay separately to visit it. It's for sure an ideal place if you are interested in old methods of time telling. But unfortunately nothing for us.
Fascinating but short on stories,"The whole site is a little surreal with the shapes and combinations of structures and I found it fascinating.  It just seemed that they could be so many more stories and explanations for the items within, perhaps an opportunity for them in the future to make something interesting reall engaging."
Normal,Good fort and belongings of ancient people as we can remember our history. Nice to see everthing in one place.
Wonderful,"Has many instruments for tracking / measuring movements of various stars and planets across the year.    The larger sun-dial present here can measure time for accuracy of upto 2 seconds.  One would be astonished by the knowing that how advances Indian astronomy was and how the Rulers of the past encouraged and embraced this branch of science almost three centuries ago, at a time when most of the other world had even no knowledge of the same."
Fascinating must visit!,An extraordinary collection of fascinating astronomical instruments that just uses sunlight. Many examples shown us by our very knowledgeable local guide - we could read off all sorts of times etc.  Would it have found out so much detail without our local guide.
Best observatory made on instruments which use only sun light for calculations.,"It's a wonder,a phenomenon,a must visit place in Jaipur.It was made about 300 years ago but very accurate and precise."
Meticulously Maintained,One has been here earlier but as one was in the neighborhood decided to drop in..very well organized and maintained..my sincere compliments
Interesting ,Worth a visit if you have a guide to explain the various structures. Cool off with an ice cream from the little shop. 
Jantar  mantar,Ancient time machine in Jaipur.  Worlds largest stone sundial. Used to measure distances and positions of celestial objects. Amazing to see.
Must visit place in Jaipur,"The Jantar Mantar is a must visit place in Jaipur. It is right opposite the City Palace. The place has the biggest sun clock which gives the accurate time. The place has many sculpture for every zodiac sign, sculptures to calculate the latitude & longitude, southern & northern…"
Make sure you get a guide,Well worth the visit and hire a guide or don’t bother coming! Guide is only 200 rupees and they give all the weird and wonderful shapes a great explanation. 
Okay visit,"We went as part of a tour which had 5/6 other attractions. We spent about 45 mins here and we tried to drag it out and stay as long as we could to get our moneys worth. There is a big sun dial, it’s amazing how they made it accurate to the second so many years ago, but once you…"
Nice place to visit,"Its a good place to see and learn the early science used by people for time and planetary studies, very good place for kids, everything seems like we are living the books we read."
Astronomer's delight.,There are only 3 such places in this world. Other two are incomplete. This is the only Janter Manter which is complete in itself. It's a small place and one hour should be sufficient to visit.
Astronomy Astrology,It is a kind of observatory set up in 1700 and still functional. Great advancement in fields of astronomy nearly 300 years old
A sight to be seen,"Jantar Mantar leaves you in awe.  It's amazing how precise our ancestors were in astronomy and also on telling time.  It boasts one of the largest sundials in the world, unfortunately, you can not go up close to see it.  Entrance fees are charged with one price for…"
Very special,"This was so good. We were going to go to see another fort, but thought we had enough and not much time left in Jaipur. We were recommended this by a guest at our hotel and she was right, it was amazing place.   We would not believe how well it was looked after and how there was…"
Fascinating,It is really fascinating to see the developments of the Indian brothers and sisters. So creative and accurate. I was just dumbstruck when I visited Jantar Mantar
Facinating ,So interesting and mezmerizing at the same time. Well worth checking out but better during the week when it's quiter. 
Very interesting ,"Interesting attraction, could spend an hour or so here. Helpful staff, were willing to give us some more information about the sculptures without wanting anything in return."
Excellent,"This is an amazing structure . It felt good to see the connection between time , horoscope , planets , the stars in our solar system and the human. Only a genius mind could have create such an important structure .I bought a book about Jantar Mantar to learn about it and to tell others in my country about it as well."
Normal,"nothing special and just a normal park. So many annoyed drivers tuktuk outside this place to offering tuktuk. You don't need tuktuk, just go by walk"
Well maintained and a must visit in Jaipur,"The Jaipur Jantar mantar is very well maintained and clean. Kudos to Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh 2 who in tumultuous times took out time for science and built 5 such Jantar Mantars. The thought, science and accuracy behind each instrument is awe inspiring. Best seen with a guide who can explain the significance of each instrument. Take a guide from inside from the tourism department designated guide. The souviner shop inside the Jantar mantar has some cool things. I picked up an adult pattern colouring book that I’ve not seen anywhere. Their notebooks and coasters are also cool and quirky. Also outside the Jantar mantar there is a bindi seller who sells colour in tiny plastic vials which women can use to adorn their forehead. Metal patterns can be dipped in the colour and put on the forehead. Something I have not seen anywhere else. Take an e-rickshaw for going around the various places of interest. It was heartening to see a lady drive the e-rickshaw. Since they went by number we did not get to ride with her but she was an inspiration!"
impressive,"was a great experience, we enjoyed much, the people that time were really geniusbut as it is open, you need to go there in good weather"
Nice place.,One can visit this place to enjoy its locality and speciality. Tickets at this place are cheap. We enjoyed it.
It's a good place,The only problem here is there is no shade here and rest it is worth visiting . Even the tickets are cheaper. We enjoyed it but it was too hot there .
Worth a short visit,Just across the entrance of City Palace gate this is again an amazing place to visit on your sightseeing tour of Jaipur. Do get a guide for understanding the facts of History.
Really worth to visit,"I would definitely recommend to visit this place. There you will get a clear picture about the history, culture and science of ancient India. It’s so incredible, so unbelievable that this observation was having capability to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and…"
Interesting if you have an inclination for science,"This place is all out in the open. The management here have really missed a trick. In order to make this place more appealing, they could really make better use of the open space to staff each apparatus with a knowledgable member of staff who can explain things properly maybe in…"
Tell the time,This is truly an amazing place. To think that its still functional since it was built. Just a wonder and worth the time spent.
Traditional time machine,It's a old observatory of how people Check Date & Time in old time. Better take a guide to understand things properly.
"Never seen anything like this, a must see",Very cool museum that focuses on astronomical instruments. Go when the sun creates shadows. Hire a guide as they’ll give you stories behind each instrument.
Interesting place,It's a wonderful experience to see the beautiful indian architecture of scientific nature. Great work. This view is from Hawa mahal.
Famous jantar mantar.,Veryy interesting place . It has been built of 18 century .place does not have much shadow.we visited in the middle of the day and it was very hot.
no shadow,This is an interesting place for people who care about astronomy and math. We visited in the middle of the day and it was very hot. place does not have much shadow. So you should probably visit early morning or when the temperature is not so high.
The only one in world,There are 5 Jantar Mantars in India but the one in Jaipur is largest functional one. It has world's largest functioning sun dial and once you understand how these equipment work ... it easily amazes you with clever thoughts of Indian kings!!  Highly recommend this to visit with…
Geography relearnt,You must hire a guide even though the price of guide is more that the tickets .. they explain all geographical reasons and rationales behind the objects.. picturesque but of you are not the kinds who didn't like geography then don't go for it. Waste of time for kids 
Instrumental art,Here is the masterpiece of art exist in form of astronomical instruments with the largest stone sundial
Observatory ,"This was a great place to visit, best to have a guide to explain all of the instruments that were there."
Science & astrology astronomy explained with perfect proof,"Must see how the instrument function full proof even today, with correct time, zodiac sign and significance explained about birth place & birth time and how the naksatra effects our life accordingly"
Incredible experience ,Home to allegedly the worlds largest sundial and an amazing assortment of astronomical calculators designed to work out the position of planets/stars and calculate time.  Plenty of places to sit and marvel at this work. Pleasant gardens.    
Amazing,Beautiful place and you will be mesmerized with the calculators which was build those days when engineers were not available... I was speechless.
Proud feeling,"Worth a visit .we felt proud visiting this place .Observatory,Sun dial which still tells u correct time and lots of other equipment which I couldn't understand but one thing is sure u come out of this place satisfied and proud of our strong scientific heritage . In my opinion …"
Place of instruments,I visited here to see the art of astronomical instruments built by sawai jai singh also has world largest stone sundial
Art of instruments,I visited here to see the art of houses astronomical instruments built by Sawai jai Singh also features world largest stone sundial
Great - but needs a little explaining,"This was a very interesting place to visit, but we were glad that we had a guide who could explain the different installations and how they worked. Quite amazing how such matters were worked out all those years ago. Worth spending 1/2 to an hour here"
Good but difficult to understand,"Honestly, I did not understand more than 75% of the equipment's. I had taken a audio guide available at the ticket counter but still failed to understand the equipments placed there. Readers visiting this place after reading my review can try out with the local person guide and check if they explain in a better way. Sadly, for me this was just a walk in the hot sun."
Very good,A must visit place if u are in jaipur. Guide is must to understand the intelligence of Indian artist. Visit when sun is slightly less harsh since it doesnt have any shade
Experience history ,It's a heritage which our city is restoring. Must visit to experience the same as we all are part of this culture. In this place you will get to know the historical instruments and equipments to know time and other various updates in ancient time.
World's Largest Stone Sundial,"Extremely interesting astronomical monument which can be used to compile the astronomical tables and used to predict the movement and timings of the sun, moon and planets. Fascinating!! One of 5 significant cities selected by one of the Maharajas in the 1720s who built them in Jaipur, Delhi, Varanasi and 2 other places. The time is so accurate.Great to see."
Favorite place in Jaipur,This is a must visit when in Jaipur.  Learning the astrological details of time and dates based on the sun's placement during the day and year are amazing.  It all started as a hobby for an ambitious person.  The time and date keeping mechanisms are intricate and surprisingly timely considering when they were built.  A unique stop.
Interesting-no real descriptions of instruments,"Go there around mid day to see the solar clock. Other instruments look fascinating but nothing is explained here. Solar clock’s working can be understood, but rest of the devices are not explained at all.Clean restrooms. Having a guide helps but they also do not know too much."
Very interesting,"There are a few of these sites throughout India (5?).  Not only do they make great Instagram fodder because of the quirky angles but they are really interesting!!! A guide will help to interpret the instruments and their uses.  Sundials, tracking planetary movements etc all still extremely accurate today!"
Captivating experience,"We visited Jantar Mantar on the longest day - June 21st, what better day to read the sun's dials in Jantar Mantar and guess the correct time. Its an enthralling and captivating experience if you have the kid in you and you have kids. Please take a guide instead of the audio set as it is cheaper as a set costs Rs 100 each while a certified guide costs Rs 100 for 1-4 people."
Fascinating Insight into the Past,"Great viewing of past time keeping. I would recommend hiring a guide, rather than hiring the basic, sometimes non functioning IPad commentary. Well set out and interesting."
Fascinating and educational,"Similar in purpose to the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, this place is also fascinating. How the instruments were made, orientated and used gives a huge insight into the culture of the times. The eagerness of the royals to understand the nature of the world in which they lived and beyond. Being able to predict astromonical events, like the cycle of the moon, allowed practical knowledge like calendars to be developed and used in daily life. To get the most of this attraction, allow a few hours, and get a knowledable guide or use the audio tour. Get there when the gates open (about 9am) to avoid the crowds. Spend time to read the background information and understand the purpose of each instrument. If you like scientific museums, you will like this one. Highly Recommended."
Nice ,Need to clean outside area. I have been many places there . Local people need to clean there city  . It was nice experience to be there
Interesting,"It was extremely hot and as I am interested in this kind of thing I found it well worthwhile. But to my wife, and indeed the average punter, I'm not sure it is with going too far out of you way to see it."
historical ,very nice place to visit we will know about ancient time how people check the time without clock and watches
Ancient Scientific Methods,"I visited this splace with my children and they both enjoyed and shocked to see the ancient people's knowledge how they have built the clocks which gives you accurate time. she calculated the time herself and exclaimed in joy that Papa , Even i can read and understand what our elders has made.One of the place you should take your kids to give them the knowledge."
Ubbelievable,The way they tell you time till the minute is amazing..Hiring a guide is a must. Kids do get bored at times
Having a guide was a great benefit,"Yes we were looking forward to our visit here, and if we had visited and looked around by ourselves we would have missed so much. Our guide gave us so much information on the instruments and with this additional information we enjoyed our visit much more. Having a sunny day we saw how the instruments provided information and were amazed at how long ago interest in facts and details prompted the construction of a varied amount of instruments. Local visitors were pleased to see us and had a selfie opportunity, not sure if it was my husbands specially grown Rajasthani style moustache which sparked their interest."
Fascinating monument and World Heritage Site,"Very interesting monument that was once a series of astronomical instruments used by Jaipur's king.  Truly impressive scale with over a dozen major instruments, enclosed in a small courtyard park.  This would be very interesting to anyone interested in the history of astronomy or Jaipur's royalty in general.  Also listed as one of India's UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Very close and convenient ot the City Palace Museum and other sites in downtown Jaipur, worth spending 30-60 minutes walking around to see everything in the park."
Historical and scietific,Amazing and very stunned by going here. Advice to all travellers to take guide even though its costly. But dont miss to c must visit.
Great if you love science ,"This is a really interesting place, massive sundials and pieces of scientific equipment, the only issue is there is no shade and it was so hot"
Jantar Mantar,A very good place for students as one can learn how time calculation was done in the earlier times using the instruments kept at Jantar Mantar.
Amazing Knowledge and Wisdom that the Ancients have,"A beautiful and well preserved place where you get to see and understand the wisdom and knowledge that the ancients possesses. The accurate instruments that observe time, movement of the sun, planets and much more. Am very impress with the creation and how the Maharaja create a small scale model to ensure that the instrument works before creating the actual version. Wonderful!"
Jaipur trip,Jantar mantar is most fascinating and very precise monument of jaipur . It gives exact position of sun and moon and all planets of solar system.But you should have a tourist guide with you to explain all the instruments .
Amazing Ancient Science Sculpture Place,You will be amazed by this place. This is a perfect example of hundreds of year of Indian Ancient Science example. Keep a guide while visiting this place.
