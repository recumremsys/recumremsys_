AMAZING MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY,"Visited this place to check it out on our way back from our Country drive. Completely amazing view of the Sunset from the top, and obviously popular time for the locals and tourist to have a late picnic. Quite a romantic setting and can be colder. A lot of tours and outdoor activities to do. We didn't have time to do the tours to the falls but will definitely do it in our next trip.There's plenty of lovely accommodation and restaurants to enjoy. It is definitely worth a trip of at least 2-4 days."
Boring with no Class,We decided to take a drive to Tamborine Mtn for the day. No parking anywhere. No restaurants serving anything other than packet frozen food and toasted sandwiches. Nothing here to see other than congestion and overpriced coffee shops with little to no fresh food. Never again.
Fantastic viewpoint,There are a number of spots along the mountain ridge that give you fantastic vista views over the wide plains below.A great spot to stop and have a picnic.
"If you have time and up for a walk, must do!","Beautiful area. We just spent the morning out here and did the glow worm tour, skywalk and checked out Curtis falls which was beautiful."
Great little hike,Great little walk. Not too difficult to complete. It was cool under the trees. A lot of loose turkeys walking around. Got some pretty good photos as well. The waterfall was not impressive at all though.
Fantabulous Park Of Tamborine ☺️,"This exciting new Eco-Adventure offers guests a unique and thrilling way to explore the beautiful rainforest canopies. Set in a magical 30 acres of privately owned rainforest beside the crystal clear rock-pools of Cedar Creek on Mt Tamborine, Queensland, Australia.The walk departs directly from the Eco Gallery with a comprehensive array of Australian rainforest flora and fauna displays.The walk takes approximately 45 minutes at a leisurely pace, when pausing to view the many points of interest and information along the way.mBeautiful Kangaroos were in the walk with us☺️"
GOLD COAST HINTERLAND,"Tambourine Mountain is about a 40 minute drive from Surfers Paradise, very popular place to visit when holidaying on the GC. There are some tour companies that do half day and full day tours to the mountain , these guided tours are great as the guides know all the nice places to visit and make your visit more informative and take you to all the popular areas where you can do shopping, visit waterfalls, eat at the locals cafes and restaurants. If you do have a car and want to self drive make sure you plan your day and where you want to go so you can make the most of your time on the mountain. i would defiantly recommend to visit this beautiful place ."
Never get tired of this place,"A fanatic place to be for souvenirs, food, walks,  and accommodation. The Mountain folk are so very happy to see you and we just love Tambo lol. Always on our list. Everything is here."
You'll be surprised.,"So much see and do, stay overnight if possible. TM is spread across a large pristine area. Exquisite places to try food, wine, delectable cheese, chocolates and so much more. For the more energetic there are many walk/hikes in the area with stunning views. You will be amazed at what you'll find at TM."
Day trip,"What a beautiful day trip this is.   Beautiful views looking across the gold coast from the top of Tambourine Mountain where hang gliders take off from, plenty of sights for all the family to see as well as wineries and liqueur tastings."
Beautiful view ,"Beautiful view , it was an very eAsy drive to the Tamborine mountain from surfers paradise . The view was so beautiful . We visited the glow worm cave and cedar creek fall. We had lots of fun ."
Amazing sunsets. ,"I am really happy I came out here. The mountain and surrounds are beautiful. There are amazing views of the gold coast on one side of the mountain and amazing views of rural farm land, nature and lakes on the other side. There is a hangliding spot which is perfect for watching the sunset and it is beyond words how beautiful it is from there."
Beautiful Little Winery Town,Escape the hustle and bustle! Beautiful wineries up here and really nice rainforest walks with waterfalls (in season) great place to relax in the cooler higher climate
HIKING TO WATERFALLS!,Thoroughly enojyed our hike to Curtis Falls. Lovely tropical forest was a cool relief from the heat. Unfortunately due to the drought the Curtis Waterfalls was only a trickle. The kids enjoyed the variety of fauna throughout the walk. They loved climbing onto some fallen tree trunks and hiding in hollow trees.The area also has lots of quaint cafes and shops for a nice break:)
Had a wine tour of Tamborine and Canungra,"What a great place, we visted 3 wineries and each place had a special thing happening as well as the wine tasting. Jonno's tours took us on a full day tour to a glow worm cave, morning tea looking over Cedar Creek estate, picnic lunch at a memorial park, Alpaca farm and wine tasting and a beautiful chapel at the 3rd winery plus all the fantastic scenery."
Tamborine Mountain,Tamborine Mountain of Australia is a very beautiful mountain to look at. One should definately watvh this mountain once.
Tambourine mountain,"Excellent trip,you can enjoy with natural beauty which nature is created.you must enjoy with your family and friends."
Worth the drive.,If you love beautiful views and handmade foods and wine this is the place for you.We love going here. There are sometimes markets on the weekends. Book a wine tasting and make time for the local eateries along the main street. This place is wonderful
Worth the drive to visit up here,"While the drive up can be a bit of an issue it is certainly worth it. There is so much to see, do and experience. From bush walks in sub tropical rainforests to wineries and cheese makers to waterfalls to shopping to glow worm caves. Then there is the dining options from pubs, cafes, restaurants everything you could want for a day out."
Lovely place to visit,We enjoyed a lovely afternoon wandering around the shops along Long Rd Gallery Walk. It is a great place to visit if you like meandering through back roads with wonderful views. Definitely recommend a drive to the area as there is plenty to see and do.
"Wow, what a day we had, Tamborine so scenic & interesting","We self drove, Tamborine Mountain and towns and walks were well sign posted...even in the dry weather, it was still pretty, the rainforest was dry, but still lovely, and water falling at Curtis Falls, a short walk from carpark. Not to be missed is Gallery walk, at Tamborine, allow a few hours here to shop and be well tempted, the eateries are vast and lovely !"
A must see,"Beautiful bush walks, waterfalls, glow worms.....awesome place! Well worth a drive to the Gold Coast hinterland!"
Ingeresting mountain village,I loved fortitude brewery and the views around. Shops quaint loved the buildings. Waterfalls not up touch maybe because there had been  o rain
Gorgeous,What a gorgeous place. With it’s village feel and friendly people. There are quite a few fudge shops for all the fudge fans.
Nice views,"Nice hike. The hike is simple and path is well pathed. Go to information and they can provide quite a lot of advice. Tried the fudge and ice cream. But compared to Springbrook, springbrook is nicer. If you have time, can visit both places."
A great day out,"This village on top of Mt Tamborine has a range of boutique fashion stores, crystal and gift shops along with boutique breweries, cafes and restaurants. Plenty to see and fun for all."
Absolutely fabulous,"So much to see and do here. Brilliant walks, markets (special times of the month) Gallery Walk, the Cheese factory, Wineries or just sit and enjoy watching the gliders on the Western side of the mountain. Breathe."
Picnic,This place is an amazing stop off while up the mountain. Its perfect to bring a picnic and  sit in this area and watch the Para gliders take off over the vista in front of you. On a sunny day there is no better spot for a nice relaxing afternoon with the best view around.
Fills in a few hours,"A slightly rainy day on the Gold Coast so we decided to pop up to Tamborine for a few hours.  There's not too much to see, but we managed to keep ourselves entertained."
Amazing views,"One of my favorite lookouts, its amazing, clean and spacious. I pray for the day I get a good sunset at the lookout."
Amazing views so close to the coast,"Such a contrast to the nearby Gold Coast. Only an hour away and a windy road to the top but the view is worth it. It's a wonderful escape from the over hyped and over developed coast; apart from the views, lovely cafes and galleries."
Hinterland so close to the Beach,"Only 40 mins drive from the heart of surfers paradise and it’s another world .,so much to see and doRainforest walks art galleries winery’s Great cafes and restaurants. We are at The Polish Place The views are spectacular and so many interesting shops Like the clock shop and gem store You can stay up there as well It would be high on the must do list"
"Picturesque, relaxing","Tamborine Mountain is a short drive from the Gold Coast and a fun place to be. As I was driving, some hang gliders filled the sky. Spectacular. There are villages for coffee shops and ice creams along the way. Bushwalks are well signed. We saw a python on the track; the waterfalls were worth it. One of the kids got a nasty bite when they picked up a leaf. This is rainforest country. Definitely recommend a day trip."
Nice drive,"Great views, lots to see and a few stops throughout the trip.It was a lovely drive and we enjoyed the stops"
Beautiful views,"Beautiful views and incredible bushwalks, lots of lookouts and trails as well as activities and restaurants."
Great country feel.,We passed through going to flying fox. So much to see and do and the view is amazing. What an amazing part of the world.
Fantastic,"Just arrived home from Queensland,had a fabulous day trip to Tambourine Mountain,what a beautiful place to visit.The views are just beautiful and when you reach the mountain top you will find lots of lovely shops and restaurants,chocolate tasting shops,wine tasting shops,clothes shops you will not be disappointed."
not to be missed,This is a great place to see a very diverse landscape and some brilliant walks to do going thru sub tropical forest.
Nice mountains with waterfall,Besides the mountains there is waterfall which people will enjoyGetting parking is a challengeOtherwise take a nice dip in the waterfall
Sights galore,"A walk to see a waterfall, wildlife or glow worms it is a great day out. Plenty to see and do in the national park and wonderful for families."
KEEP KOOL IN SUMMER,Tamborine is a great place to keep cool in summer.  Great shops & a good variety of products. Pity the Labor STATE GOVERNMENT can't fix the roads !
YOU must see the THIRD oldest National Park in the World,"Located just over 40 minutes from the centre of the GC you may check out a treasure trove of things to see, treats to taste and beauty to discover. Was able to breathe the fresh mountain air. Stop at a roadside stall and pick up locally grown fresh produce or try over 40 varieties of mouth-watering fudge at Granny Macs.Overall--8/10"
Great day out,"We spent a day on the mountain, lovely water falls, sky walk, little towns cute cafes. All the watter  fall walks were child friendly, my kids loved spotting lizards(some were enormous) ands parrots. Pack a picknick and off you go!"
Amzing forest ,"Tamborine mountain is a must place to go. With so many different entrance and attractions, this forest has options for everyone, from kids to elderly people tp enjoy, including cafes, bars, restaurants, waterfall, trails and etc."
Must visit,A great look out spot on Tamborine Mountain in the middle of a great forest. It’s shady so the warm sun does not get into your face and it’s also a quiet little area. The tall trees in the forest makes it a photo worthy spot. Try venturing a little into the trees and there will be a path to a track. A must go spot when visiting Tamborine Mountain.
Nice place to visit,Enjoyed a lovely walk around here. Lots to see and do. Great for the family and lots of fudge shops if you like fudge.
One of my favourite place to visit on the Gold Coast,"Great bushwalks and beautiful scenery. Walks are not to long if you're short for time. I never leave North Tambourine without stopping at the local Irish Pub for a pint of Guinness. Also, there's a great spot to watch the sunset on the hillside just before you get into Tambourine."
Worth a short stop if you are in the area,"We visited as part of a full day tour to Lamington. Located 30 minutes drive from the Gold Coast and 40 minutes from Brisbane, Mount Tambourine is popular for day trips - when we went there were several coach parties and it is not a huge place. Gallery Walk has a variety of shops (some catering for locals and others quite quirky and geared to tourists), plus plenty of eateries and several wine tasting venues (our favourite was Heritage Wines). In good weather, the scenery is pretty stunning, but it did feel a bit commercial and touristy."
lovely,"Tamborine is such a glorious spot although it can get very busy on weekends.. So many wineries to sample, great accommodations, bushwalks, views ( The view from the Eagle Heights Hotel out to the coast is pretty amazing, for example) There are so many pretty spots and interesting little shops, roadside stalls.. You have to go to the Tamborine Mountain Distillery - that you must do..  Amazing homegrown liqueurs that have won medals world wide... So much to keep you busy…. stay overnight.."
Breathtaking,Was here for an intimate wedding ceremony and was totally blown away by the scenic drive and breathtaking view of the mountains and the nature. Perfect getaway for those who wants to be out of the city for a while. Was there during winter and everything was simply romantic.
Tamborine mountain visitor centre gives good information,"the visitor centre provides various catelogues which give detailed information on look out points from where we can view natural beauty of forest,mountains and falls etc.driving through curvey,sharp turn on roads is thrilling.lust green thick forest is enjoyable.particularly one point where we saw a person doing para gliding"
Mountain Fun-Australia stye.,"We have been to this area twice and have enjoyed the uniqueness, people and activities.  Eclectic shops, wine tasting, weekend music with food and libations. Mountains and hikes are beautiful."
Something for everyone!,"I've been here plenty of times now and will keep coming back whenever the opportunity arises... or I make the opportunity. ;-)Personally I love the bushwalks, the views, and the wines and food... ok, I love it all!Best times to visit are when it is not school holidays and when it is not super hot.  For me, anyway, as I enjoy hikes etc much more."
Views and wine.,There is a lovely viewing spot up here to enjoy watching the sunset. Drive up and see the stunning capture of our Creator entitled as the best artist ever!
"Superb Views, Great Shopping at Gallery Walk","Tamborine mountain is a superb area for views, walks as well as diverse shopping in Tamborine village particularly at the Gallery Walk area. The Gallery Walk has many varied shops and arty type places with many different goods to suit all tastes. Don’t go at weekends as parking gets tight."
Amazing views,"Amazing views over the scenic rim and Gold Coast. Lots of different shops to browse, from antquies to fudge and cuckoo clocks. Fabulous day out."
Nothing spectacular,I found the Roama St Parklands in Brisbane much better than the Skywalk in Tamborine. For $19.50 you do not really see much. Just trees and almost no wildlife. Will give this a miss. The Parklands are free.
Enjoyed the Time at Tambourine ,"Friends told us to head to Tambourine Mountain and we really enjoyed the time here. Good group of shops, pick the cafe for lunch carefully as they vary in quality.Head to skywalk (note $19.50 entry fee) as well.We will head back here next time we are in Broadbeach."
Escape from the Gold Coast Beaches.,"Soaring gums , the occasional koala along the nature walks and a eclectic group of craft shops and Galleries set amongst magnificent mountain scenery. Only a hour or so from Surfers Paradise  Well worth the views looking far down to the magnificent beaches of the the Gold Coast. A really good Bavarian restaurant with German beers and sauerkraut topped off a lovely afternoon."
A must to visit,"Beautiful place to visit when on  the Gold Coast, get away from the main tourist areas. Great restaurants sand food, lots to see and with plenty of wonderful walks."
Lots to see and do,"A visit to Tamborine Mountain is a must for visitors to the Gold Coast. Plenty of rainforest walks, a visit to wineries and the  Tamborine Mountain Distillery to taste the award winning  liqueurs made on the premises. There are plenty of eateries dotted around the mountain offering different types of cuisine, and especially in the Gallery Walk area, where you can find lots of interesting tourist shops. We visited the glow-worm caves, something different if you have never seen these creatures before. We thoroughly enjoyed a leisurely day eating, shopping and out in the fresh air."
Bit Disappointing,"We’d been looking forward to our trip to the village. It’s reached after a pleasant drive and there are lots of lovely trees. What we found disappointing were the shops and goods on offer. We were expecting quirky, unique, artisan products but largely we were let down. There’s some good coffee to be had and the chocolates looked delicious but generally the items on offer were very pedestrian and to be found in lots of places. Prices were on the high side too. We did enjoy the cuckoo clock shop and found most shopkeepers to be friendly and welcoming."
Amazing area with great food ,"My family and I come up to Mount Tamborine quite a few times a year with friends. The area is so beautiful and there is something for everyone. The walks to the waterfalls are amazing and the restaurants and cafes are really good. The main tourist street has really friendly staff in every store. I suggest trying the fudge and going to the wine place that has a restaurant, bar and I think there is something to do with cheese there. It’s at the end of the street up from the round about I think. You can’t miss it as it’s quite big. I definitely recommend going to Mount Tamborine if you are visiting the Gold Coast, or if you live on the Gold Coast."
views,"A great place to stop off and sit on a rug, have a picnic and look at the views. A place where hang gliders jump off. Take the time to sit and admire the views."
Worth a visit,"Lovely town to visit, plenty of coffee shops, brewery's and fudge shops! Plan your day for places to see as vast area. Went to sky walk which was ok and ticked off. Clean and tidy place."
lots to offer for everyone,"Tambourine Mountain is a great choice as it holds appeal to a diverse set of tastes. You can enjoy the drive and stop and look at all the shops and stop at a café or restaurant, for the more adventurous spirit there is the skywalk above the rainforest canopy, for the nature orientated there is the national park full of trails to trek through. It suits all budgets also, from free to the higher end. It is an easy, about 45 minute drive from the gold Coast (depending on where you are staying). There are also accommodation options if you want to extend the visit. Would recommend."
Beautiful place ,"We loved our trip up to the Tamborine mountains. It's a nice picturesque drive. The town is a busy hub of activity. Many different eateries, fudge stores, retail shops to be found here. We attended a local brewery/cheese maker and winery all under one roof. It's was beautiful. We grabbed some delicious fudge to have with our coffees when we returned to our hotel. The Lemon meringue flavor was refreshing and delicious. Plenty of great trails to explore while in the area. We will definitely return."
Love the 'Mountain',"Actually, it's a hill, but it's 5 degrees cooler up there. Between the restaurants like Masala Shanit, and the bush walks through Cedar Creak or towards the coast, it's a delight. JUST never venture to the Main Street of Eagle Heights on a Sunday ..."
Gallery Walk,Very pretty drive with view to the coastlines from Coolangatta to Surfers.Lots of little interesting shops to browse.Cafes restaurants. If you go in the cooler months take a jacket or coat as it gets rather cold in the wintertime.Lots to see and do.You can also watch the hang gliders take off or stay for the weekend as there are lots places to stay. Worth the drive even if you just go for the day.
Avocado Sunset...Heaven. ,"There is one review for the Avocado Sunset b&b which gives it a poor rating. Their comments were that there was nobody there to greet them on arrival, that their room was by the entrance so they were disturbed with other guests coming in, that their bed was uncomfortable and their ‘rainforest view’ was spoilt because people could see into their bathroom. We stayed for a week from the 15th to the 22nd of January 2018 (last week as I write) and didn’t want to leave !We didn’t advise our arrival time so Richard and Cheryl couldn’t greet us either but surely that was to be expected ? It’s a b&b not a hotel!There are only 4 rooms, no kids so couples coming for a restful stay so not noisy and not disturbing. The mattress which was complained about has been changed and is the most comfortable thing I’ve ever slept on. Finally, the view of the rainforest is through the bathroom window. The other windows in the room look out onto a beautifully manicured rock garden and if you really want a view then choose one of the other rooms or use the shared veranda and take a freely supplied glass of port with you and relax and watch the sun go down with a view to the west towards the great dividing range of mountains. This is the best b&b we’ve ever been to anywhere and we hope to return. If you want to be met on arrival, tell them what time you’ll be there and they’ll meet you. If you want a large set of rooms, which could be termed a suite practically, then choose the Oriental Room which we had and which was the subject of the bad review. If you want slightly less space and unobstructed views, then choose ‘Rainforest’ or ‘Safari’(mind out for the leopard!).Please don’t be put off by one misguided whinge... it’s the best you’ll find. Did I mention the freshly cooked breakfasts...and of course those views. Don’t miss a trip to heaven. We’re delighted we didn’t."
Spend the weekend ,"A great place for a day trip from the Gold Coast or Brisbane- it’s always cooler up there by a couple of degrees. There’s something for everyone. Gallery Walk and it’s cafes and shops are generally 9-4. There are breweries, distilleries and wineries to visit. Parks and gardens for picnics- and a glow worm cave. Then there are the various walks in the National Parks- something for every level hiker. Evening time there are restaurants, and pubs and the local bowls club often has live music too. Stay the weekend and relax and enjoy with the amazing wildlife at your doorstep"
tamborine,it has a great atmosphere. The shops and resturants are different. It is nice just waiking down the main street
Nature and Adventure ,Loved this place. Great for nature lovers. Went to 2 waterfalls. Nice food and shopping areas at gallery walk. Also went to the glow worm cave. Very convenient to move around.
Knoll section,"Car park, picnic area, and toilets. View at the top was well worth it.We walked down to waterfall through rain forest. Path quite wet and muddy in places and seventy steps so good walking shoes advised. I would take water to drink. View of waterfall obscured by plants to get a brilliant photom"
Avoid at all costs,"Massively overrated. Very touristy. Not what we were expecting at all. Yes, there are some nice walks in the rainforest fragments around the mountain (e.g. the knolls area), but the town is an awful, tacky, fudge shop tourist trap. Go elsewhere."
Mike Millar,Great place to visit. Amazing views back to the gold coast. Nice hinterland drive great art and craft shops with a local brewery for a pint and lunch.
Tambourine Mountain,"This is a true oasis, only 40 minutes drive from the Gold Coast. All local produce, stunning original art work, clothing and the most amazing fudge shops ever. The main street consists of stunning and unique  shops. The restaurants are all first class, and really affordable for the whole family. The Cuckoo Shop is a must, along with the Fairy Shop for the kids and also the big kids. You can explore further to the rock pools and rain forest, which is home to stunning waterfalls. This is a must  on your visit list"
lovely drive,"had a lovely drive up tamborine mountain and enjoyed exploring the many waterfalls and rockpools. had fun walking around the treetop walk and attending the distillery nearby. could easily spend a day or two up here admiring the sights. lots of wildlife, and far cooler than down on the coast. rain tends to set in during the afternoons,"
Beautiful rainforest walk,Hiked through the rainforest to Cedar Creek Rock Pools and Curtis Falls. The cascades were incredible! Wish we had more time to spend here. Loved seeing the biodiversity-including the sleeping bats-along the way!
Unbelievable Views and Plenty to do!,Our family has been holidaying on the Gold Coast for years and had never been up Mt Tambourine and were really glad we did. With absolutely amazing views from many look out points and heaps to see and do we recommend this to anyone. We visited the Glow Worm Caves which the kids loved and did the Gallery Walk and I was amazed at the Cuckoo Clock shop with hundreds of amazing clocks. There was many more things to see and do which we have planned for the next trip. A great getaway from the Coast!
Rain Forest,This is a must see for anyone visiting Queensland. Gallery shops and wine tasting are must stops at this popular attraction.
great getaway,"Wonderful views, lots of little shops and accomodation to choose from. Take 3 -4 days to do it all comfortably."
Great drive to reach there,"Two ways of approaching Tamborine. The windy way or the very windy way. Great shopping area and, surprisingly, a lot of bargains. some great walks and when you can see the coast its breathtakingly beautiful."
Beautiful!!,We went to Tamborine in August. It is a very beautiful place. We did a small beautiful hike to see a waterfall. Unfortunately it was small but it must be incredible if it rains a few days before!!
Nice walk,"Really enjoyed the drive there, and the walk was great the different Trees and the trunks were mind blowing .The Waterfall was really lovely and different birds and huge Trees sure were worth seeing .One group tried to take a pushchair down the walk not a good idea ."
"The best things outside of Gold Coast beaches begin on Mt, Tamborine","Mt. Tamborine is an easy drive from the gold coast. Rent a car and go! It has artsy shops, yummy bakeries and restaurants, nice residents, an eclectic selection of homes and Inns, great views over both sides, and is covered with fun things to do including the rain forest sky walk and the glow worm cave. The little town of Tamborine Mountain has a frontier-style cafe (Spice of Life) with great food. No trip to the area is complete without coming up here."
A Great Getaway from Crowds,"Spent a day here - up from the Gold Coast.  While there a lot of visitors here, particularly on the weekends, it is a relaxing and stress free place that allows you to take life slowly - even if only for a few hours. Strolled the main drag, checked vendors' stalls and sampled many wares. Very relaxing, good family bonding."
"Good food, excellent sunset view","Amazing driving to get there through narrow/curvy but in good condition roads.Excellent food with professional, courteous waiters and/or waitresses.Breath taking sunset view from a few of lookout locations, we enjoyed a couple of sunsets from the Beacon lookout, it gets CHILLY though, get yourself warm clothing or even a good blanket.The sunset seems to last forever!!!, I guess the sun keeps reflecting the gigantic desert areas, so, the sun is gone but you keep looking at the red horizon for a very long time."
Great drive and enjoyable shopping precinct.,"On a recent trip to the Gold Coast we enjoyed a half day trip through the Tambourine Mountain. The drive was enjoyable and the vistas stunning. It could do with a few viewing stops for drivers. We did the Gallery Walk down Long Road and enjoyed the quirky and specialist shops. The highlight for us was the German Cuckoo Clock Nest which had a vast array of clocks varying in prices with some on the larger ones pushing $20,000. Despite being at altitude and in the middle of winter we enjoyed a beautiful day, sun shining. And it was still quite busy, and we went on a Monday! Something for everyone, especially if you are after something different or antique. Due to an injury we decided not to do any of the bushwalks, but given what we saw from the road it would be wise to allow some time to do one or two of those as well."
Escaping the Heatwave,"With a UK visitor  staying with us we decided to try and find a cooler spot for lunch. Tambourine Mountain  wasvthe chosen destination. It was probably cooler but still too hot to do our usual walk around the shops. However we did find a nice cafe withca shady verandah  and enjoyed a very pleasant time there, Good food, excellent service and perfect vistas,  what more could we ask for."
Lovely but not a lot there,A beautiful artisan town but not a lot there.  Montville is much better to be honest.  There are few places to visit with great activities down the mountain.
Great Views & Food,"Great views of the Gold Coast. Affordable Accommodation. Plenty of things to do for families, couples or solo. Great food venue options for casual or formal. Car is your best travel option so you can see both sides. You can even score rhubarb or avocadoes at the road side stalls."
Amazing and lovely place to visit,"We had one extra day to spend and decided to visit Mt Tamborine. It was a great place with good food and many wonderful shops to visit. Coming from a hot and humid Asian country, the cool temperature (visited in June 2017) at Mt Tamborine was greatly welcomed. Overall Mt Tamborine was a lovely  place to visit"
BEAUTIFUL VIEWS,"At first I thought the mountain was named after the musical instrument, but learnt that it is an Aboriginal name. We stopped to admire the beautiful views on a lovely, warm Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly there weren't many people around. This is a must see if you are in the area. The drive there was just as beautiful. Well recommended."
A lovely area in the hinterland,"If you would like a day away from the tourist buzz of Surfers Paradise, take a trip up to Tamborine Mountain. There are views on the way, and restaurants, craft shops and boutiques in Mt Tamborine."
Amazing place to visit,"A short drive up from the Gold Coast, with amazing vistas, wonderful food and art in the  village and some beautiful bush walks. Great for families or couples."
Must see in Gold Coast,Magnificent place with wonderful views. The drive to this place is also great. Never boring. Always great.
A lovely way to spend a few hours,"Beautiful food, lovely shops in the main street, nice pub & brewery and stunning views from the hang gliding ledge."
Beautiful Place,"A lovely place away from the heat of the coast. Varied things to see and do; Cedar creek for the goannas, shopping in Gallery Walk, back to nature in the Botanic Garden.Great views everywhere."
Best day out- lots of things to see and its not far.,Lots of specialty shop ( English sweet shop etc) and restaurants plus specialty shops-all with lovely walks- in a cooler climate too.Tambourine was settled by Europeans and the culture and feel of place reflects this difference. Its a nice place to stay a night too with B&B and vineyard accommodation- their website is good.
Beautiful place to visit,"A must do in Queensland!  I had a great day mooching around the gift shops, eating scones and cream, talking to the shop keepers and walking the Skywalk amongst the trees!   The drive itself is amazing - just wish I had hired that soft top car."
Day out at Mount Tamborine,"If you are on holiday on the Gold coast,sick of the hot weather,pop up to Mount Tamborine,,You will need a car for this one,half and hour drive from surfers, Cafes , arts and crafts, great views of the gold coast,and surrounding country side,Do not forget to call into the Eagle roost cafe .on the way to the village,good food, and views."
"Great place to visit, scenery, shopping, camping and adventure","There is lost here for everyone. Bush walks, adventure sports, shopping, dining, fabulous scenery and camping and up market cabins. Great for a family getaway. Busy during weekends and public holidays, maybe a bit too busy so avoid if you can."
Nice day out,"Travelled up to Tamborine Mountain just wanted a day visiting the various craft markets, coffee and lunch. There was certainly  plenty to look at. We went on a Wednesday, parking was not easy but we spent the time looking at all the craft shops, old houses converted. As expected the pricing is above average, even a hotdog though very fresh and nice was almost $8.00 with the top of the line $17.00. Not that much for the kids to look at but it kept us amused and busy for a number of hours. Purchased some specialist teas and coffees and ornaments."
Lookout!,"Look out over the beautiful Gold Coast Hinterland. It is gorgeous. In the Summer, this area offers some relief from the heat and has numerous shops and restaurants to enjoy."
Lots to see and do.,"Obvious tourist area but even for locals that haven't visited there is heaps to do. A vast amount of different eateries, natural parks and attractions and interesting shopping."
Lovely trips,"Lovely drive around the area, mountain view and country roads.plenty of lookouts, mountain trails  creek n waterfalls to enjoy, lovely little town n shops to stop and enjoy food and drinks.plenty to see and good to go spend a day or two relaxing."
Lovely drive,"Tamborine Mountain in the Gold Coast Hinterland is a delightful area relaxing area to visit for a day trip. Road a bit windy but quite an easy drive , well signposted. About 30 minutes from the Gold Coast going W. lots of accommodation/ restaurants , wineries, interesting craft shops on Gallery Walk especially."
Nice day trip,Watched the hang gliders and paragliders fly from the esplanade. Best time i found was before lunch on the weekend when it is warm. Lots of people watch. I like taking photos as everyone does. Not a big drive from either the gold coast or brisbane. Afterwards we like to have lunch and coffee at one of our favourites at the mountain brew coffee in main street
Abundance of waterfalls and walks,Lovely little town perched atop Mt Tamborine. Definitely check out the information centres as there is an abundance of waterfalls and walking tracks to make your day well worth it.
Charming region with lots of appeal,"Stunning scenery, waterfalls, nature walks, wine and wine tasting, brewing and distilling, fresh avocados, rhubarb, charming village shopping, galleries, restaurants, bed 'n breakfasts, visit for a day, stay for a few, there is something for everyone"
Lovely view from the top,"A lovely day out, quite a long steep drive to the top, but well worth it.It's a bit difficult to know when you've got to the top, other than seeing that the road then starts descending again. So we missed the top and had to turn back and then find somewhere to park up. It's not really signposted to say here you are, park here.Once parked up, it's lovely, with stunning views across the valleys below.Coming back down the mountain, there are a couple of coffee places, and we stopped at one. Public toilets were not very accessible, needing a key to get in, obtained from behind the counter of the coffee shop, and not particularly salubrious.There looked to be some very nice posh restaurants at the top of the mountain, but they looked far too expensive for us on a cheap day out."
The green behind the gold.,"If you visit the Gold Coast you must visit Mount Tamborine , we never miss this trip and we never get enough of the beauty of the tropical mountains and the waterfalls, we always walk and check out all the European style cafes and shops, our favourite is the chillian cafe, beautiful European atmosphere and very friendly service, must visit."
If you have not done this you have to !!,Definitely worth the drive up to the hinterland rather than just staying by the beach. Great views of the coast and Surfers and lots to do and see.
On top of the world.,"A beautiful magical mountain, with amazing views, great walking tracks. A lovely littlew town in the clouds. Avocados are in abundance here."
CAMERON FALLS /  SANDY CREEK CIRCUIT WALK,"This walk in located in the Knoll Section of the mountain.  Turn off main western road, (which is the main road through the mountain), into Main Street and continue past the shops where the road then becomes Knoll Road, then keep left where the road forks.There is a reasonable sized car park, toilets, and a picnic area offering views of the Gold Coast skyline.  The walk took us around an hour, and descends to the creek through a beautiful rainforest.  The walk is easy to do, but there are uphill sections and around seventy steps to negotiate.  The waterfalls are rain fed, so if there has not been much rain do not expect to see a spectacular waterfall.  On our visit it was quite sparse, and although there is a viewing area for the falls, some plants are blocking the view."
beautiful nature,This provide a good respite from the city. The trail is not too difficult to walk as there is a pathway on the waterfall route. Just remember to bring some water and your walking shoes.
"Nice view from the mountain, interesting township","I visited this mountain in Feb 2016 with my wife. The drive there from Gold Coast town area is around an hour, the road can get quite windy when moving up to the mountain. Once you are near the top, you may see cars being parked by the road side - that could normally mean it's a good viewpoint (that was what we did, just followed other visitors).  There is a small township at the top, and you will see quaint shops, restaurants, even a weekend market that sells things from coffee to antiques (but don't get your hopes too high, we didn't see anything that was worth buying). After a couple of days at the surfers' paradise, I think the Tambourine Mountain offered us a respite from the commerciality of the city, and it's nice to be nearer to nature. And oh, don't miss the waterfall that's around the region, it's only a 40 minute hike to get there."
Not what it seems,"Walked the very overpriced Skywalk, walked the gallery walk with overpriced cafes and shops with nick nacks. It was talked up too much and gives nothing special. Would not recommend for anyone under the age of 80."
Beautiful views,We drove up to Tamborine Mountain to visit Thunderbird Park and were absolutely stunned by the scenery. Definitely worth a looksee.
Beautiful country,Our family only spent a few hours in the area but this was enough to make us want to plan a holiday for longer to the area. Very picturesque lush green forest areas with quaint little towns. Plenty of B&B style accommodation. Will be looking into revisiting for sure
Great day out,"Take the time to visit this area. we had a great day touring this area and found many points  of interest, including views over the hills and valleys together with small villages to walk around and find a place to sit relax and have a coffee."
Love this place,Beautiful place to visit if ever never here plenty of quirky shops to visit like the cuckoo clock shop and others.Also some nice places to eat and the fudge shop omg so many different flavors.And more. Nature walks
Lovely day out!,"Mount Tamborine is a perfect day-tour destination if you are staying on Gold Coast. It is easy to reach from the beach area, only about 30 km if i remember correctly. Get out early so you can see all the little charming things that Mount Tamborine can offer. There are both nature scenery and man-made sights, such as charming gallery walk for example, plus a number of little picturesque cafes and galleries dotted along the forest drives, there is a number of scenic lookouts and nature walks, there is sky walk (walkway built at the level of rain forest tree tops), there  is a point where you can observe sky divers take off like some prehistoric flying dinosaurs, there is an exotic distillery that makes some very interesting liquors, and at some days there is an aboriginal dance show in the evenings. It is overall a very scenic and beautiful place to visit, much more interesting than the central beaches of Gold Coast."
A pleasant day out,"A nice way to spend a day is a visit to Mt Tambourine. There are many things to do from a visit to Curtis Falls or take in a winery and sample a drop or two or shop at the variety of fashion, gems stones and toffee shops. When your hungry there is a variety of dining options to suit the family. Set aside a full day if you want to take it all in including the fantastic views. If you visit the Gold Coast make Tambourine a must see on the agenda."
Beautiful area,"First and foremost the rainforest around the mountain is gorgeous!!! Lush, tropical and healthy. It does get cool even during summer in the evenings so be prepared for that. Overall the local shops and restaurants are lovely but they sort of have that boutique wanky kinda feel... sort of like it's expensive and only hipsters and grandmothers would dig it... but in honesty there is something for everyone! The whole town is invested in local business and local produce which is great but business is very much focused on weekend tourism... if your visiting on a Monday or Tuesday night, restaurants and stuff are not as widely available. It should be on anyone's list of places to see in south east Queensland!!"
"""Outstanding, Stunning, Neverending Scenic, Out to Sea Views""","Standing on top of one of the most stunning Mountain scenic outlook views, overlooking the Gold Coast high rise buildings and out to sea. Truly magnificent and amazing experience! Bring your telescopic camera. Great spot to stop off and to soak up the atmosphere to surrounding Coastal outlook.Hope this helps the driving traveller. Hire a good car, we did. A small car is suffice, but a four wheel drive is definitely worth while for sitting up higher off the road while travelling up into the mountain. Its more scenic than sitting lower to the road. You'll enjoy either way. My choice was to sit higher up from the road. Have a wonder half day, or full day trip, travelling up to Tamborine Mountain, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.Hope this helps."
"Great view of the hinterlands, and nice shops and wineries","Getting to the top of the mountain is easy - there are four roads leading up from generally all directions.The roads can get quite busy on weekends, and you will experience some traffic at the top, as well as many cars parked in close proximity to the road.  It's much quieter on weekdays, unless it's a holiday.There are several roadside stopping areas with great views, of either the Brisbane/Gold Coast side, or the Hinterlands side, of the mountain. On a good, windy day, you can often catch parasail and paragliders taking off and landing from the grassy hills near the road.There are also a number of good (and expensive and busy) restaurants, open for lunch.  Most establishments on Tamborine close at about 4pm, incuding shops and wineries.Also not to be missed is the Witches Chase Cheese and Brewing company, which has a restaurant, bar, and cheese shop on the mountain. Their cheese are not cheap, but they are delicious. I recommend their local brie, blue, and maasdam.Also not to be missed is the TMD or Tamborine Mountain Distillery, which distills a number of herbal liqueurs (some award-winning) which cannot be found elsewhere. The distillery tour wasn't operating on the day we went, but the tasting room was open. We ended up with a Hibiscus, Lavender, and Elderberry liqueurs.On the way up or down, you might also stop in at the Tamborine Mountain Coffee Plantation - yes, they do grow coffee on the mountain, and it is excellent coffee, well worth taking home a bag.  This last time, we met the new owners (literally new, they were still painting so they could re-open), and they told us they're buying a new roaster, and will be in full operation shortly.Tamborine Mountain is very accessible from the Gold Coast, and well worth one, or more, visits."
Gold Coast antedote,"When you have had your fill of the plastic fantastic on the GC ... GO HIGH to Mt Tambourine for a well earned break. Best for bush walk rejuvenation,  cooler air,  quiet rural sanctuary life style meandering through the ara, where the food and drink and everyone serving it has a more authentic vibe. If you must go on a busy Sunday. .get there very early for either brunch or  craft and antique browsing  before the crowds check invade I  recommend you follow the signs to the domain to check out the monthly Sunday craft markets..I believe second  Sunday each month."
"Breath taking views, stunning walks through rainforest and excellent restaurants, with wonderful craft shops.","Tamborine Mountain is the most amazing place to visit. A walk in the Rain Forest is an absolute must. The stunning craft shops, boutiques, and restaurants and cafes are just wonderful with varied menus, to suit any travellers taste. The actual drive up the mountain is in its self breath taking."
Amazing trip,"Visited both tambourine mountain and springbrook. Enjoyable morning in the rainforest ,wonderful water falls."
Tamborine mountain diversity & culture,"Must visit for tourist & local alike. If you're looking for a cultural experience, local produce,artisan wares, restaurants, boutique shops, wine tasting, bush walks, art galleries, places to stay and so much more, come to Tamborine mountain. It is a hidden gem of the coast, oh did I mention the diachromous handmade jewellery, the tea shop, teddy bear nook, cheese factory and glow worm tour! My most favourite eats treats is Clancys Irish pub.See you there!"
No visit to Gold Coast is complete without a day in the mountains,"Awesome craft beers and a foodie heaven.. if you need gluten free it is there too!  Interesting shops and lots of faerie themes as well as a cool Scarecrow festival during October.  Short and longer walks with picnic baskets in the local forests cater to experienced and also unfit hikers.. good for rainy and sunny days.. families, couples and singles can find something fun to do up on the mountain.. spas and horseriding up here is lovely too"
Lovely place for a day trip,Played Tamborine Mountain Golf Course yesterday with my two friends and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We only had time to play 9 holes (it is a 9 hole course anyway) but found it remarkably easy to walk despite it being quite hilly.  Some really interesting holes and I would like to play it again before I finish my holiday.  After golf we took a walk to Curtis Falls - one of the smaller waterfalls in the area. We enjoyed the walk through the amazing trees.  We ended up taking a walk down the main road and into the many gift shops - many had the usual touristy tat but several had some really nice/unusual items.  I bought a lovely blue glazed bowl for a gift made by a local potter.  There were plenty of eateries and parking.  The road from Tamborine back to Tweed Heads is not for the faint hearted though!
Beautiful view,"We went to visit the mountain as it looked like a great place to visit with young children. We were amazed by the beautiful scenery, the beautiful view on the Gold Coast. There's also places you can visit such as shops. The view, however, was the main reason for our enjoyment!"
A day in the Mountains,"We had never visited Tamborine Mountain before so were unsure what to expect but we were thoroughly impressed and had a great day out with the kids.  It was a very pleasant little town with a delicious fudge shop (my hubby says this is the best fudge he's ever eaten), some little cafes and boutiques and a few wine tastings.  Reminded me alot of Montville on the Sunshine Coast. We enjoyed the Skywalk tour and a quick visit to the Botanical Gardens."
A great day in the Mountain,Didn't expect so many fun things to do in the mountain.  We took a nice drive to Tamborine Mountain on a beautiful Sunday morning and came across the school market where we enjoyed a walking breakfast with burgers and coffee.  Then we went for a nice skywalk whick took about 45 minutes.  The tasty late lunch at a cozy cafe in the village nearby put our first mountain explore to a perfect end!
Great views,"Whilst staying on the Gold Coast we visited the mountain which has great views over the surrounding lands and to the coast. A few wineries,nice cafes and lots of art. Nice National park and walks nearby."
Lovely scenery,"We took a nice drive up to Tamborine village,pleasant little place but needs a few more quirky shops and less winery ones.we have been a few times before and I was glad to see the cuckoo clock shop was still there."
A complete day out,Headed up on a Tuesday for a scenic walk and ended up staying for lunch. We live only 30 minutes from Tamborine now but this was only the second visit. Already looking forward to going back again to try out other beautiful circuits.
Skywalk,Nice atmosphere and shops but the Skywalk was just wonderful. Not too strenuous with plenty of places to rest and the views were stunning. Not to mention the wildlife in the bushes
Definitely a must do,"I've lived in Queensland all these years and only just recently discovered that Mt Tamborine is a heck of a lot more than just the name of a mountain. The drive up alone is worth it with all the spectacular and lish greenery that you normally would expect to have to drive further north to see. When I think of all the overseas and interstate visitors I have had over the years and all the time I have wasted in driving up to places like Maleny and Montville, when I had this on my doorstep and didn't even realise it. Now we make it a regular Sunday drive."
Lovely area,Tamborine is a lovely day out from the Gold Coast. There are lots of walks in the area and many little shops and cafes. It's about an hours drive from Broadbeach and well signed. You may need to put North Tamborine into your sat Nav. Take your walking shoes and a jacket!
the views and the drive alone are worth it.,"I was hesitant to go to Tamborine mountain on this trip as my partner has a broken ankle and could not do any of the longer walks.  but he loved the drive up there, loved the little town up there, the view of the goldcoast is breathtaking, as is the view to the west of the valley and the north up the mountains.  we went to the skywalk and just did the first 350 metres through the treetops which was fine on crutches.  we had something to eat and a coffee in the little township and took photos from a number of roadside vantage points that required no walking.  we spent from 12pm till 4pm including the drive from the the goldy.  then at 4 we headed to the gc airport to fly home.  lovely way to spend the last afternoon of our trip."
Unsure which exact spot i am at but breath taking views ,A must go if you love scenery. Amazing place where you can enjoy both sun & cooling weather with breathtaking sceneries.
Tamborine Curtis falls ,"Beautiful rainforest,  tall trees. Not a lot of water in the falls. Short walk to the falls. Nice 2.5 km return trip from just a short distance from the falls."
Beautiful spot for nature lovers,"Great views at certain points, there's lot of wildlife and nature. Would love to come back and explore the park further as we only covered a very tiny part."
Beautiful trails and tracks for all levels,"Beautiful, scenic walks around an amazing part of Queensland. Free parking and plenty of cafes at the end of the trails with a mind blowing drive to the top of the mountain. Awesome views back down to the gold coast on the drive down too."
Very Nice Views!,"We did a tour with Lee Rossow from Adventures in Nature 24/7 and had an excellent time.  We did some wine and spirits tasting, we went to the cheese factory and had some cheese and we went to the fudge shop (all I can say about this is YUM YUM YUM) and we went to all the little shops.  The views from this area are beautiful and you can see the geological makeup of the area.  (Thank you Lee for the History Lessons and Geology Lessons, it was very interesting!)"
Nothing to shout about,"The place is really quite oversold, especially the rainforest tree top walk.  Very disappointing. You can definitely enjoy better tree top walks in other parts of the world, like Singapore's Hort Park for FREE.If you're from Asia and planning to go up a mountain or lookout in Gold Coast, Glasshouse Mountain will definitely be a better consideration."
Worth a trip but take your time,"We drove up the mountain from the Gold Coast side via Oxenford and then came down back to Brisbane via North Tamborine and Waterford. The way back was a much more windy drive that the short trip up from Oxenford but considerably more attractive with lovely, almost rainforest-like scenery on the way down. I preferred driving down this way - it was easier on the car to come up the other way from the Gold Coast. The Village at the top of the mountain has a very nice fudge shop, some wine and liqueur tasting rooms, some cute cafes and a botanical gardens to visit. There are also some very attractive walking trails around the mountain and some extremely nice B&Bs to stay at with very nice restaurants. The best time to come is through the week as it is less overrun with people then."
Do not go on weekend,Absolutely chaotic and so many motorbike and noisy car and rude and loud people everywhere.i was expecting pieceful and nice forest experience but once I arrived I noticed absolutely disguating. Never go there on weekend
Bigger than you realise,"I now live at Tamborine Mountain and I can honestly say iy is a fantastic place to visit. It is huge, there are so many things to see and do, you would need at least a week to see only some of it. The wineries are fantastic and going for a walk having a picnic, shopping so much to see and do."
"Make your way up the winding road, beautiful views. then spend the day exploring! A MUST do!","Tamborine offers so much, put your feet in the cold pool at the bottom of the waterfall, go for a short walk, a long stroll or a hike through the rain forest.  Find the markets and spend hours lost in exploration and challenge yourself to not want to buy too much.  Eat at the markets or drive and find a vineyard for an experience.  See the glow worm caves, watch the hang gliders take off from the flat part of the mountain, as you drive past, find a park and sit and watch.  Explore the many trails, roads and other shops, bakeries, there is so much to choose from.  Even take a picnic and a rug and sit and enjoy the views.  There are people from all walks of life here, from the rough and ready, through to the couture crowd and something to fit all tastes.  Family groups, couples and seniors, always lots of people."
Amazing views,We visited tamborine mountain it was a lovely drive to get up to the top. Lots of trail walks with waterfalls also a tree top trail great for people who love walking views and scenery amazing
Amazing place and great Service! ,"I recently held my 40th birthday at Eden's in the private room and it was a wonderful experience. I had so many of my guests comment on the fantastic place, views and food! I can't speak highly enough on the organisation of the event and great service.  Thanks Sarala and staff! An awesome day, thank you!"
Cool.....,Took a lazy drive there from Cedar Lake . Some of us went to the Glow worm cave . Had a nice fish & chip lunch at a shop. Then walk around the shops . Tried the ice cream.The mist came in at 3 pm ........ nice
What a view!,I could look out at that view all day! You must visit if you're in the area and make sure you take a camera with you.
"Cameron Falls, Knoll stretch of Tamborine National Park","We visited today and did the Curtis Falls walk (a separate review) which was a good, easy walk.  Cameron Falls off Knoll Rd is a longer walk with a lovely lookout & picnic spot at the entrance.  I would say it's for average fitness levels.  The falls themselves were a bit more of a trickle - would be better after rain!  We completed the circuit in under an hour.  I wouldn't recommend the circuit for prams or wheelchairs - lots of stairs and uneven paths.  Good pathways in general though.  Wear comfy shoes, the number of people I see walking these tracks in thongs (flip flops) is crazy! Plenty of parking but the entry/exit road is one way you beware/give way to oncoming traffic.  A nice day trip from Brissie or the Goldie."
"Great views, good places to eat, get some fudge.","My wife and I go to Tambourine often. There are a few ways up the mountain. From Nerang head out Beaudesert Road, the first turn off is the steepest and quickest way up. Be warned this is a steep climb. The second turn off just outside of Canungra is the goat track which is a nice drive. From Oxenford head west and up the rear of Tambourine Mountain. This way is longer but a lot easier on the car. LIKES: Once you are at Tambourine there are so many things to do. We prefer to head to a winery for lunch. Lately we have gone to Cedar Creek Winery who offer a great lunch or Devonshire tea. They also have glow worms. There is a IGA at the top of the mountain to get some picnic supplies and head over to one of the many lookouts for a picnic. My pick would be the take off area for the hand gliders. On a good day you can see hundreds of these crazy loons taking off into he sky. If you are up for a swim head down near Thunderbird park where there is a waterfall which you can swim in. Tambourine has many fudge shops where they make on site fudge of so many different flavours. DISLIKE: The drive up"
Lovely Day Out,"A wonderful day out enjoying the countryside and the nature walks. Driving around going nowhere in particular, stopping here and there to have a look around or a Devonshire Tea is so relaxing. The natural arch is a great walk"
Lovely Mountains!,These are beautiful mountains. There is a cafe in the mountains that you can go to with a fire place etc. I would definitely go back and recommend! Minutes from the city!
Beautiful vistas!,We drove up one morning from Gold Coast and enjoyed a lovely picnic in one of the beautiful parks.  There are many little shops and places of interest to browse and the views are spectacular!  A lovely morning activity but could have spent longer.
Very quaint place,"Visiting family in Helensvale we were told to go and see Tamborine mountain "" it's quite interesting"" an understatement! The first time we went you couldn't see across the road as the clouds had dropped. The second time we went we were rewarded by this ""town""on the of a mountain, everything was there along one Main Street. We went on to the sky walk in the forest, a short circular walk taking you right up into the canopy, a beautiful experience. The cafe is well stocked and the toilets are some of the cleanest you will find. Well done, I suggest they have a visitor book"
Amazing variety of cuckoo clocks,Thought we'd have a quick look into the clock shop while looking around the main shopping strip at Eagle Heights. Worth the drive there just to view the variety of clocks. I've never seen so many cuckoo clocks or grandfather clocks in one shop before.
A must to see,"We home exchange to the Gold Coast every other year.   When Canadian guests come to visit Tamborine Mountain is a must trip.  The drive is windy but spectacular with view points allowing a visual of the Gold Coast and the hinterlands.  The shops are great for a retail therapy stroll, several fudge or ice cream destinations to keep up the energy.  Late lunch at the brew pub never disappoints a perfect day."
Lovely place to visit,"Had a lovely drive up to Tamborine Mountain which only took about 25 minutes from the Gold Coast, lovely windy roads and views and a really quaint town with lots of restaurants and specialty shops, checkout the German Cuckoo clock shop, very interesting."
When you want a change from the beaches,"The beaches of the Gold Coast are spectacular, but behind the coast are the wonderful mountains - Mt Tamborine in particular - an easy 30-40 minute drive from the coast and well signposted. The mountain abounds in natural beauty, nature trails, treetop walks, waterfalls and spectacular scenery. Take a break at the hang glider launch point, visit wineries, cafes, restaurants, the smelly cheese factory, craft shops, and even a botanical gardens -  there is something for everyone.It is a great place to visit on a hot coast day since the temperature is generally 5 degrees lower than the coastal strip."
there is no new to indians,"its very familiar to indians who visited ooti, kodaikanal, talakona or simply a mountain near our town. i dont know whether my tour driver (scenic day tours) has not covered all thing or those r the only thing there, nothing to feel new. he took us to a water fall, where there a stream, like tap water."
Awesome views!,"Stopped at the hang gliding spot and the view was simply awesome, take off your shoes, walk in the grass and then take a seat and just enjoy the moment. I definitely am going back to see this again. Loved the whole area."
Summer Holidays on the Gold Coast ,"Just a must do when you visit the Gold Coast you don't need a tour of you have a car as its a very easy drive with great sign posting to all its attractions and points of interest. It's all about its natural beauty and not about the shops nothing really special about them at all. They sell things that are available all over the coast. Just enjoy the views, walks and natural beauty of the place."
Something for everyone!,"I love Tamborine Mountain. There really is something for everyone. Enjoy beautiful rainforest walks, have lunch on the mountain at St Bernard's - soaking in the amazing views, visit the wineries and sample their wares or time your trip for the markets on Sunday and stay the night in a B&B (with a view, of course!). There's adventure parks with high/low ropes, tree top walks and glow worm caves.  It can be very busy ( much loved) so start your day early!"
Better than Eumundi!,"We visited the showground markets during our stay here on the mountain... and what a gem. Luckily we got there early... was amazed at the number of people by 10am !! We visited Eumundi earlier in the week, and although I was good, these markets were better. More handmade goodies, more space, and a whole lot more cheer! Check out the wonderful lady selling the great range of her handmade pottery in a variety of colour schemes. Super gifts and so reasonably priced. Ditto the rock lady for the kids... she had a pile of bargains the kids adored. So many get finds here. A must see."
A great place to connect with nature,"The tree top walk was very interesting with amazing views from the look out tower above the tree canopy at O'Riellys and further in we found some amazing waterfalls.  The town had very interesting shops.  We only spent 1 day in the area, but would have liked to spend 1 or 2 more."
Don't expect sophisticated shopping here any more,"All of what made a trip to the Mountain special in terms of shopping is now gone.Seriously drowning in twee and cheap ""hippie"" stuff, the craftspeople who used to populate Gallery Walk are all gone . Still one of the most beautiful places on the planet though"
A Mountain experience on the Gold Coast,"Mt.Tamborine is always a favorite of day visitors and International Tourists alike.I find it a little disappointing,as nothing much has changed in 25 years. The food is fairly low quality and overpriced,with a very limited variety. Plenty of hippy style shops,but nothing for the Boys ! Its also very difficult to find parking on the weekends. There are some good wineries to sample as well a short distance out of the town."
"one of australia, s best","Tambor ine mountain is easily one of queensland/australia, s best places to visit or live with beautiful views from the top to most parts of qld, towards the coast and inland are both fantastic, also within distance of brisbane  and coolangatta without a huge deal of travelling, the drive up the mountain is worth it alone, green everywhere and beautiful forest are my fav.and almost moved there a few years ago, well worth a visit!"
Lovely! ,"It's a must if you are on the Gold Coast. About a 30-40minute drive from Broadbeach. There are lovely rainforests to walk through, with amazing trees and wildlife. And the little town is very cool, and an easy stroll up and down the street. The cuckoo clock shop is fantastic. And the staff are more than happy for you to just look around and even take photos. It's a great escape from the beachy areas. And go to the brewery for lunch. It was delicious!"
Beautiful place,Had a picnic at one of the point lookout and i must it was a very intriguing experience. We had a view of the part of the mountain. Went to Spice of Life cafe to grab a picnic basket and breakfast! I would definitely come here again.
Best place to buy gifts for family and friends apart from the natural beauty of the area.,This is always our last place to visit when we go to the gold coast and that is because of the amount of gifts we buy. There is not much room left in the car after our visit. Every time we come here we discover new and unique gifts and you have to visit the Cuckoo Clock Shop. Absolutely amazing. My latest purchases were highlighted by wrought metal individual wine bottle holders. Looking forward to going back to buy some more.
Walked almost all the tracks,"We set out for a day trip and completed almost all tracks. Previously we walked the witches falls circuit so this wasn't done in the day (great hike tho). This time we did all the others. I recommend all the tracks except the palm Grove section. Unfortunately, the mountain and waterfall lookouts have been closed for awhile which made this hike pointless for us as we like a lookout or something. The nature is great across all tracks. All tracks are well marked and short enough to be enjoyed by a family. Plenty of attractions, cafes, etc too."
Some good views,Was a hazy day when I was there so the view from the top was not as spectacular as it would have been on a clear day.  Some of the mountains closer to Brisbane actually give you better views.
Very Nice day out,Left Currumbin to go to the mountain ( 20 min. drive) did the Gallery Walk- a good way to see the forest canopy and then spent a long time strolling around the quaint shops. On the way we visited Curtis Falls where we saw several types of Lizards - you have to look carefully for them when walking to the Falls. The Falls them selves are dissapointing however the walk (15 min.) is worth it.
Visit the village and the hang-gliding launching site on the mountainside.,"The Gallery Walk through the main village is filled with coffee shops, restaurants, lots of interesting arts & crafts shops, accommodation options...and plenty of tourists and a good place to visit summer or winter.The village reminds me of the Dandenong's in Victoria (Olinda, Sassafras and Mt Evelyn) as well as Hahndorf, Mt Barker and Stirling in the Adelaide Hills as well as Mundaring and Kalamunda on the Darling Scarp near Perth.The Hang-gliding launch site is over 540 metres high above sea level on the south west side of the high ridge. We arrived to late to see any fliers however the views over the farms and paddocks below are worth the drive alone.Visit early in the morning and spend the day exploring...a great spot."
Nice place to visit,"Visited some of the brewers and cheese makers, as well as the fudge shop and the distillery. It was a lovely day out even in heavy fog."
Gallery Walk Tamborine MOuntain,"A great day out, ideal for hot weather on the coast because it is cooler. Interesting shops and Hotels plenty to see and do once you park your car"
A lovely day pottering about.,"We visited several places on Tamborine Mountain. I bought a beautiful glass pendant at the little glass shop. We had a nice lunch at a small takeaway bar. The Skywalk was nice, but a little frightening for me, as I'm not good with heights. However, I had my photo taken at the end of the cantilever to prove I can overcome heights, if briefly!!! The service in the cafe there left a bit to be desired, as we were there latish in the day, and coffee was no longer being served. (about 4 pm!!!)"
Mountain escape,"Only 20 mins from goldcoast it is a beautiful day trip full of adventure & surprises. Set off for an action packed bush walk and pic Nic adventure in the various rainforest walks that include delightful cascading waterfalls. Or a moderate activity day exploring the tourist shops, antiques, wine tasting or a variety of fabulous restaurants. Go for a day or stay for a few nights as there is variety of reasonable accomodation year round. Recomend the Scottish place to stay. And Clancys Irish pub to eat."
Nice spot with pretty walks,"We basically visited to see the waterfalls and do some walks, and were not disappointed. Our favourite was Cedar Creek Falls, which had a great swimming hole below the falls, although Curits Falls was also nice. Cameron Falls and Witches Falls were both a bit disappointing, but the rainforest walks were still beautiful.Not as spectacular as nearby Springbrook National Park, but a nice area nonetheless."
Open gardens trail,"September brings another good reason to visit. The open gardens trail puts several (8 this year) privately owned gardens on the map and allows like minded people to pour through to ooh and ahh. From cottage gardens to sixty acre landscaping missions there is inspiration for all. A well organised exhibition, it includes a central coffee stop at the Showgrounds with produce for purchase. There is a fee involved but if this is what you are into then this is where you should be. ( 3 days only)"
Beautiful place to visit.,"But don't come by bus, we often here of trucks and buses overturning because of the horrible road.  Otherwise, Mount Tamborine is a wonderful place to sightsee, shop and eat with so much to choose from."
love the views,it had good views and good food went to subway and went for the longest drive around the mountain and went to the waterfalls
Delightfully scenic area,"Beautiful area - the lovely village has lots of interesting shops, cafes and restaurants. The are specialty shops like the German Cuckoo Clock nest, Bygone Days, dress boutiques and craft shops too. A great day out."
Nice trails,"Lots of trails to do which range from easy to hard. There is a gallery walk area which should not be missed. If you are game for skywalk, it is also worth a visit. Variety of food is aplenty."
Lost to see,"Easy drive up here and goods vies on the way, village has some interesting shops and places to eat. Visit the distillery some very niceHave also in past some wine tours around here and some nice wines"
The great south east.,"A great place to experience the great out doors .This mountain and quaint village offers markets during the month,Wine tours, and some pretty interesting arts and crafts shops.It has some good walks and some amazing views ..so take your cams..Not very nice if it's raining but you can settle in for a coffee or a beer with the local businesses around the mountain ..Would I recommend it..sure..a great getaway from the city lights and a place to feel FREE.."
a must do,"This is an absolutely must do if you are into galleries, wineries, glow worms or anything else that you can think of. There is rainforest walks, horse riding, digging for gems and just so much more for everyone."
A great day out,"Tambourine is a top spot for a good day out. Apart from all the restaurants and the usual tourist shops, there is a heap of things to do. The falls are just out of the tourist strip and it's a nice walk  around that area. Be sure to check the exposed areas of your body and especially your feet for leeches. They can get inside your shoes and suck away to their hearts content. If it is still open, the old St Bernards Hotel is a great place for a cool drink and a meal. I remember staying there many years ago and going to your room you could pick up a bit of speed downhill. The way up through Upper Coomera is a nice drive and I would suggest going back down Henry Robert Drive for some more great views of the Gold Coast.It's worth the drive just to take in the views and scenery. One thing to be sure of is to take a jacket no matter what time of year it is. It can get quite cool, even on a summers day."
Art galleries galore,"We had half-a-day to fill-in, so drove up Tamborine Mountain to enjoy strolling through the art galleries, fudge shops and noticing the many restaurants available to tourists.  Lots of stalls sold fresh fruit and vegetables, so we purchased several avocados for the following week.   Really good cheese at a diary factory just inland from Gallery Way with friendly pub adjacent.   Botanical Gardens a bit dreary in winter, but the nearby Sky Walk in the Treetops was pleasant on a sunny afternoon."
Cuckoo Clocks Galore,"Fresh air, weather was beautiful and the locals were wonderful. We had a lovely lunch & walked around and did a bit of shopping from the unique gift shops"
Nice place to visit!,"Something for everyone @ Tambourine Mountain! For locals, a regular day out to enjoy the attractions and shopping, for visitors and tourists, a unique destination that will and doe's cater for ages and tastes.All year round, this 28 square kilometre plateau in the scenic rim of South East Queensland, shines and provides a beautiful relaxed atmosphere with many attractions and spectacular views..For the shop-a-holic, Gallery Walk caters to everyone's needs, from the sweet tooth with The Chocolate Kingdom and Chocolate Gallery,and Fudge Heaven, art, craft, gift and nick knack shops along the roadway, with good walking paths on both sides, and parking sometimes hard, but generally okay. Clean public facilities are available.For the adventurous, try the wine tasting at the wineries, visit the Tambourine Mountain Distillery, and cafes provide a varied menu of snacks to full meals at restaurants.Fashion, souvenirs (from Tambourine Dreaming), and the unusual gift from the German Clock Shop which also has a range of German souvenirs! The display of cuckoo clocks is a delight.Attractions apart from the lookouts and amazing views of the Gold Coast and towards Brisbane across the green fields and mountains, there are plenty of opportunities to take a bushwalk in the Tambourine National Park, and see the waterfalls, and enjoy a bbq!Tambourine Rainforest Skywalk, Tree Top Challenge, Thunderbird Park, Glow Worm Caves are all located around the Tambourine Mountain region.Information centres are located along Gallery Walk and at Doughty Road corner near Crystal Falls.This is a must place to visit for all Gold Coast visitors, for a fantastic trip and a great day out. Stay longer, the option is there with several accommodation choices available.The road from the M1 turnoff to Tambourine Mountain is narrow and winding, but in good condition and not to steep.  Takes about 40 minutes from highway to Tambourine Mountain. The annual Scarecrow Festival is on in October 16-18th!"
Great day drive,Tamborine is a great place for a Sunday drive out of the Gold Coast. Great views from eagles nest and the village is arty with studios galore. Great pub as well
Nice day visit,We live coming up here for the day - never stay overnight though - pretty expensive Some lovely little cafes and shops up here though.
GREAT PLACE,Nice  Scenery  and rainforest  a great mix of stores and restaurants  in Long Road  also try some adult fudge while you are there make sure you visit the cuckoo clock shop amazing
Lazy Weekend,"we just got in the car and motored along the road and really just ended up here -we had not been here for 30 years what a wonderful day - its a tourist town but with a heart and feels back in time - scenery was amazing , markets were on and the little shops and restaurants were packed but not in your face - I am definitely going back to stay overnight"
Gorgeous Drive,We have driven up to Mt Tamborine several times when we've holidayed on the Gold Coast. Its such a beatiful scenice (and easy) drive. Worth heading up in the morning and having a lovely long breakfast before meandering down the Main St and looking through all the great shops.
"Worth a trip, rental car, taxi or coach.",Just a short half hour drive from downtown Gold Coast. The road is testing for the driver but in good condition. The views of the Gold Coast from Tamborine Mountain are spectacular.
whats not to love?,"Absolutely beautiful scenery, fresh air, gorgeous plant life and not too crowded so that you can enjoy a peaceful outting."
pleasant place to visit,Tamborine village called Gallery walk is worth a visit a large number of eateries a winery a couple of fudge outlets also worth a visit is old tamborine village at the historical society.
Day trip,"Tamborine is a lovely place. Always a little crowded but ... its popular. Quirky shops line up with the std gift shop fare. A little time exploring around finds wonderful views out over Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and some very pleasant restaurants....tried some of these last year."
"A day of Walking, talking, shopping and eating","This is such a fun day, so much to do. You can go on walks, stop off at pubs, restaurants for lunch and fit in a bit of shopping. Definite winner!"
EVERY VISIT IS DIFFERENT,"Every time I visit Mount Tamborine there is something different to see, The Glow Worm Cave ( man made ), Winer's, shops, cafes ,Curtis & Cedar Falls  were you walk through the rainforest and sometimes  see a wild animals and I love the Botanical Gardens they are really nice to see"
It's So Good - I Now Live Here,"If you love SE Queensland and all it has to offer - the beaches, the sun, the relaxed lifestyle BUT cannot take the HUMIDITY... then Tamborine Mountain is for you.Just 45 minutes drive inland and up 'the hill' to the plateau is where all the magic happens. For a start it's 4-5 degrees cooler than the coast AND there is little to no humidity - absolutely blissful.And if easy access to the Gold Coast and Brisbane doesn't do it for you then how about world class tourism facilities and attractions right at your doorstep. Then there are all the wineries and their 'cellar doors', the swathe of restaurants & cafes and last but not least, the local eateries, to tempt the tastebuds.Cap it all off with a community that is community focussed and you have all that is Tamborine Mountain - a little gem right at the heart of SE QLD.It's so good the family and I moved here!"
Quaint little town!,A nice easy drive up to Tamborine Mountain with spectacular views out to the Gold Coast. A nice stroll through the shops but make sure you have a look at the German shop with the cuckoo clocks and magnificent Grandfather clocks- amazing! Lots of nice eateries to choose from and lovely fudge for those with a sweet tooth. A look in the Glass Castle to view sensational handmade glass jewellery. A very delightful afternoon spent on the Gold Coast hinterland!
Day trip from Surfers Paradise,"Guided by GPS, took a drive up from Surfers Paradise on a Friday morning 2 weeks ago. Was cool all the way up windy, narrow road. Did not switch on aircond of car. Traffic wasn't heavy. We covered Skywalk (got lost with GPS initially), only 2 shops at Gallery Walk as we were rushing for lunch at Polish Place and then a visit to Nathan Winery for wine tasting with cheese. Wasn't able to visit Glow Worm cave as time does not permit. Street parking is plentiful and free at Tamborine Mt."
Lovely Tamborine!,"Really nice area with many individual shops. We visited The Glass Studio and they have pieces going for a song with buy one, get one free. The pendants, earrings are handcrafted and the designs are modern. Handmade crafts e.g. plagues, bookmarks are available and they are really lovely. We ate at Bavarian - great pork knuckle and beer at reasonable prices! Cosy, homely restaurant with nice views - pond, ducks, water wheel."
Great day out from the bustle of the Gold Coast,This was a great escape on our last day of our holiday.  Be warned it is much cooler up in the mountains!  The gallery shops were good full of lots of different kinds of things to buy.  Nice selection
Perfect getaway,Had a fantastic mid week break on Mt Tamborine. Booked a night in a cute hideaway retreat and enjoyed bush walks through the rainforest followed by winery tastings. The new vineyard restaurant we stumbled upon at Mason Wines was divine. A must visit!
Nice area,Nice area which some fantastic individual shops. The shops are a little pricey but this is out of the way
I could spend weeks here!!!,"We only had a day here with 2 young children and the visitor info book says you can't possibly do it all in one day... geez are they right!! We did the thunder egg fossicking (reviewed separately), skywalk and Curtis falls.  The drive up and down the mountain alone are breathtaking with plenty of little spots to stop to appreciate the view.  The little villages look awesome and so many gorgeous shops to browse.  We ate at the thunderbird park (reviewed separately) and the wood fired pizza was amazing.  The Curtis falls were gorgeous (reviewed separately). We wish we could have stayed for weeks, hope to be back to stay on the mountain some day."
Great drive from Gold Coast and pristine beauty,"Good location in Gold Coast hinterland with laid back lifestyle and great viewing. This area would undoubtedly get very busy during summer and spring but May was a great time to visit. Gallery Walk has a good variety of shops, galleries, cafes and general stores."
Pleasant touristy mountain area,"Mostly a place for day trippers from the Gold Coast. Apart from the paragliding launch there is little easily accessible natural beauty for non residents and visitors passing through. But worthwhile if you're on a short itinerary or just want to eat, drink and buy tourist items."
Interesting Area,"Unfortunately rain had flooded the glow worm caves and a tree had fallen on the sky walk but a 500 metre well formed track took us down to Curtis Falls which were huge and very photographic after recent rain. Tamborine Mountain itself has touristy shops, galleries and restaurants which didn't really do anything for me but the surrounding area is very pretty and worth exploring, and the nearby views of the distant Surfers Paradise high rises are spectacular."
Great Sunday or Weekend drive,"This is such a beautiful area, packed with cafes, restaurants, galleries, vineyards, and other attractions like the Sky Walk and the Glow Worm caves. It's away from the Gold Coast madness and you could wander to your hearts content amongst little shops and galleries or stop and take in the vast panoramas either east or west facing. Just stunning."
Great hiking,"Stunning scenery, great walking trails through rainforest along creekside to Curtis and Cameron Falls. Pricey tourist shopping."
Interesting falls to be seen,Some reasonably short bush walks can be taken in the region. Visited both Curtis and Camerons falls plus some really nice scenic views to get great photos.
Beautiful view,Amazing view and small quiet local community. Love the atmosphere. Have been here a few times before and always amazing. You can easily go to the information center and get help to find what you wanna see. Saw the glowworms and it was fascinating. Not that expensive. Worth a drive!
Plan a 1 Day Itinerary to Enjoy the Gold Coast Hinterland,"If your planning a trip to the Gold Coast, ensure you set aside at least 1 day to enjoy the Hinterland. No doubt there are plenty of tours that can be booked for the area ranging from touristy style tours to winery tours, but personally I always prefer self-guided tours. If your don't have a vehicle, consider renting a car and travelling out to Tamborine. In one day it is realistic to visit the Distillery, Witches Falls winery, the glow worm caves, bush walking at cedar creek falls, strolling the Gallery Walk, sampling at the Witches Chase Cheese, Tamborine brewery, Eagle heights and North Tamborine and enjoy the botanical gardens. Everything in Tamborine is accessible by vehicle and the trip would be good for all ages. To be honest, leave the beach for one day of your trip and venture out to the Hinterland, you will be glad you did!"
Trip to Tamborine,Highly recommend a trip to MtTamborine to explore the food & wine trail as well as rainforest walks...Beautiful scene to have a lovely day out! In my top 10 places of the world.Two Tours CombinedWe were really happy when we found this QDT's tour to Springbrook and Tamborine. Both destinations were on our wish list for our short stay in Brisbane and we had looked at other tours that inly did one without the other. This tour combined both and we figured we had saved a day and the cost of a second tour. We covered everything we wanted. A bonus was that there were two wine tasting centres in the tourist walk where we had some free time after lunch. The shopping didn't interest us so was an opportunity to do a mini wine tour as well. A bonus! Top value especially given it included a lunch at a winery and other day tours we saw didn't include any food or drinks.
"Magnificent views, walks, food & wine",Highly recommend a trip to MtTamborine to explore the food & wine trail as well as rainforest walks and lookouts. The hinterland is stunning.
Worth a visit,"We went for a drive up here last week. First stop was the Glow Worm Caves which were quite good, next stop was The Knoll National Park. This has a waterfall in it which is quite strenuous to get to, lots of walking up and down hills and very hard to see. You can get close if you like to clamber over rocks and aren't afraid of heights or you can go to the lookout and see it in the distance behind some trees. It's about a 3km walk so if you like bushwalking you may enjoy this (be careful of the leeches, the place is crawling with them.)If you don't like bushwalking i would say give it a miss and go to Curtain Falls. This is another waterfall in Tamborine Mountain but much easier to get to, short walk from the carpark and the falls are fairly good. Last stop was Eagle Heights Mountain Resort for a beer on the way home and excellent views of the Gold Coast.The drive is ok, very steep hills so probably not a good idea if you have a caravan. Stop in at the information centre, the lady there is very helpful."
Beautiful Mountain,Visited the vineyard on the mountain.  Beautiful place.  Breathtaking scenery.  Had a wonderful time touring the mountain with my kids.
Natural beauty - with slight blemishes!,"The drive was very pleasant with lots of lovely scenic views. Not too far from the Gold Coast for a real tree change. Disappointed by the 'galleries' on the mountain. Largely filled with the same old crap available at most weekend markets. Very little truly original, locally made artisan products. Nothing I haven't seen before, but cheaper."
great place to get away from the gold Coast for a wile,"wineries ,the sites, shopping, markets, or just a pleasant drive, Tambourine mountains have it, a good way of having a break from the hectic  pace of the Gold Coast ."
Unique arts and crafts street,"We visited Tamborine Mountain on a weekend. Every shop in the Main Street were filled with arts and crafts, cafes, galleries, wineries, fudge shop, jewellery, German gift shop and unique shops.  A great day out apart from the usual theme parks of the Gold Coast."
A great escape for a week or a weekend,"We recently went to Tamborine Mountain for a weekend stay and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The drive up the mountain is beautiful and not far from the Gold Coast or Brisbane. Hitting Eagle Heights first, we stopped to do the Gallery Walk and were impressed with the shops, cafes and restaurants. It has a real country, community feel and is extremely popular judging by the number of people walking around.There are lots of food options as well as gifts and gourmet items. The whole atmosphere is lovely (including the houses!). Up higher on the mountain are several great wineries - Mason Eden, Witches Falls (the best) and Heritage Wines to name a few. They are all hosted by great staff who really know about the products they are selling. They also offer memberships which give significant discounts on wines. Three Little Pigs and Mason Eden have great food too and although we did not get to try, the Indian place is also recommended. The Witches Chase Cheese shop is also fabulous.A lot of the hotels/B&Bs are expensive (we paid about $360 per night) but there are camping options and other alternatives but you'll have to do your research as Wotif and other companies don't readily advertise them.Make sure you visit North Tamborine as well as Eagle Heights - there are little pockets all over the place with great places. The Distillery is also a must see and to really engage in the experience, do a rainforest walk - there are maps giving plenty of options. There are even easy walks with wheelchair and pram access.All in all, this was a fantastic getaway and families, couples and children will all find something to enjoy."
A Fantasic place to Visit !,"Tamborine Mountain is situated in the Gold Coast Hinterland,  I have visited Tamborine Mountain many times as it is always changing.  There is so much to see and do around Mt. Tamborine area such as the Rainforest Skywalk, Glow Worm Caves. Hot air Ballooning, Walking tracks provided in six sections of Tambourine National Park that include Curtis Falls, Macdonald Rainforest, Cedar Creek Falls, Esme Park, Palm Grove,  Witches Falls,  Tamborine Mountain Winery,  Botanic Gardens,  The Tree Top Challenge And the well known Gallery Walk for those who like to shop.Most treks are short and can be walked within a hour or less depending on your level of fitness !I would recommend staying here for a weekend to be able to see and do everything as Tamborine Mountain is a beautiful place for all ages !!"
A fabulous place !,"We recently moved to Tamborine Mountain, it is a very unique place with lots to offer. Unique because it also has the most beautiful pure spring water. Fine dining restaurants and winery's, lots of shops, a great botanic garden, views to die for, great markets, best for a fudge devil too !"
What can you say,"beautiful area of the Gold Coast, fantastic little boutique shops and cafe/restaurants in the main street.  Wonderful old English Pub (The Fox and Hound) ideal for snack or meal on the way.  Markets are good value too"
Love the place!,"Countryside, places to see things to do - great place where you can be in the thick of it, or somewhere quiet within short walks."
Hummer Winery Tour,We started in the morning & visited wineries in the Tambourine Mountains with my wife & daughter.We tasted the wines and enjoyed the food. There were only 5 of us in the Hummer...a lovely Japanese couple on a Honeymoon.
Full of Surprises,The views and interesting places to visit.  We went to the Scarecrow Festival and were amazed at the number of private people and businesses that had participated.  This is destined to become an annual event.
Great way to see the mountain,I had a great experience on the Hop On Hop Off Bus to Tamborine.. It took me where I wanted to go and when I wanted to go.. Me and my husband loved it... Great Idea
Mt. Tamborine is a jewel in hinterland Goldcoast,"If you like peaceful surroundings, beautiful views and enjoy countryside relaxed settings then this place is for you. It is full of beautiful waterfalls, swimming holes, picturesque villages and inviting bed and breakfasts. I had been there twice and loved it each time. Will be back shortly."
so much to do!,I recommend trying a few vineyards especially the one with the glow worm cave! being a kiwi this is something we see a lot but if you havn't its really cool! there are many walking tracks with waterfalls so check out the visitors centre to see what one suits you. Also for a great meal try the German restaurant at the top of the hill its yum!
Lovely day out or quiet getaway,"Tamborine Mountain is lovely in many ways. Great to escape the Gold Coast heat in summer and to enjoy the cold in winter. Lots of little shops (arts & crafts oriented) in the main strip but quite touristy and often busy so expect to look for a place to park. Vast array of vineyards and cafes and restaurants with European accents (the Polish Place, the Dutch Bite Cafe, the Bavarian Grill Haus, George's Paragon, the many English Tea houses). Lovely for a day out or for a quiet getaway with the accommodation on offer catering to all wallets. Tip: go in spring or summer to enjoy the scent of something other than gum trees lingering in the air :)"
A tourist paradise,The 'strip' offers lots of variety shops to browse through along the whole road from Fudge to Clocks. There are many places to eat as well. Good to visit. Take time to look around the area and see the wonderful views back over the Gold Coast. The Botanical Gardens are a little gem if you have time or just want a picnic in peace.
Attractive area tacky shops,Very pleasant drive up to Tamborine with spectacular views of the Gold Coast from numerous vantage points. A number of rustic and charming places to eat in or stay. The area is spoilt by a tacky shopping strip on the main highway selling overpriced kitsch. Still worth a visit especially if you avoid the tourist shops.
Beautiful place,"This was a day out for us, the whole area is stunning and quaint at the same time, it has beautiful walks available and a lovely town. If your in the area it's worth a trip up the mountain for a day. Enjoy!"
Gallery walk,"Great spot for locals and tourists alike,I am talking ab out Gallery Walk Tambourine Mountain. 1 hour from the Gola coast and the same time from Brisbane.Lots of cafes, craft shops.Icecream parlour and fudge to die for. away fromhere are wineries and lovely walking tracks.Views to the Gold coast.What more could you want."
Tambourine Mountain - a little gem only one hour from the Gold Coast,"I had heard about Tambourine Mountain on previous visits to Australia but had never been. It is a volcanic plateau about 500 metres above sea level and an hour's drive from the Gold Coast airport. There are about 5,000 -7,000 people living there It is however about as far away from the Gold Coast in atmosphere as one can easily get. It feels like a different universe. It is cooler and has many remaining bits of tropical rain forest. It feels a little similar to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. Lots of craft/pottery shops and good cafes/restaurants doing good, often home-cooked food. It is also an excellent base for doing short family walks (3-5 km ).  If you are in the Gold Coast area and want to experience something completely different without driving far, this is for you."
Fun Day in the Outdoors,"The small group I was in (3 total) only spent an afternoon at Tamborine Mountain but we could have spent the whole day there. They have so many activities that I think anybody could find enough to do to entertain themselves for a whole day.The view to Tamborine Mountain from the south is spectacular. This is the way we traveled going up to the mtn and we really enjoyed it. I was looking out my window the whole time and we had to stop for pictures twice because we liked the views so much. The one thing that we ended up doing on the mtn was the skywalk. We arrived around 2pm or so and stayed until 5. They say the walk typically takes 1 hour for visitors but we took three. If you don't take your time (which we did) I understand how most people would be in and out in an hour. The walk isn't that long. We took our time reading all the signs, observing nature and thinking.  It's unfortunate that the walk closes so early (they were honking for us to leave, haha) because around the time we were leaving is the time that the animals started to come out. We saw a bilby, a goanna and various types of birds. The one downside about the skywalk is that it costs $20 per person.We stopped at the glow worm cave but didn't go in because it,too, cost money to enter the cave.If you are looking for a totally free day, you can go hiking, window shop in the town and check out the view at the Eagle Heights Mtn Resort. Even though it was getting dark and stormy when we visited the Eagle Heights Mtn Resort, the view was still spectaular. We even saw some small wild grey kangaroos!On the website they list that the mountain offers, accommodation, dining, professional wedding services, shopping, art galleries and other events. If you are thinking about visiting, I found both the website and information centre to be very helpful."
Spectacular view,"While the road is pretty winding, and steep in places, it is worth the drive.  It  feels 10 degrees cooler as soon as you arrive.  Quaint village seems like time stopped. Lots of arts and crafts, wineries, road side stalls and fresh produce. Plenty of great B & Bs and boutique accommodation."
Beautiful scenery,If you take a trip to the Gold Coast do yourself a favour and visit Tambourine Mountain.They have a little shopping village and glow worm caves.The view from the lookout was spectacular.We went with southern cross tours and a big thanks to Keith our tour guide.
Plenty to appeal to everyone,"Tamborine has many local attractions, from the winding roads, to elevated views over the Canungra Valley. Main street has a village feel with shops, novelties, food & drink abound.Thunderbird Park is great for a visit, stop and watch Hang-gliders jump off the cliff, floating majestically above, visit the monthly markets, or visit St Bernards Hotel for a great lunch, in the company of 2 beautiful St Bernard hosts (dogs)Repeated day trips can always find something new, an easy drive from Brisbane or the Gold Coast"
Worth the drive.,"We found the road up had a few too many curves (for my stomach anyway), but it was worth the discomfort.  A very beautiful place and the skywalk was fabulous."
Absolutely gorgeous drive,"Fantastic rain forest areas where you can park and walk around. Lots of craft shops, but not particularly worthwhile. Come for the fantastic walks."
Interesting walks,"Traveled to Tamborine Mountain on the way back from holiday on the gold coast. Had lunch in Curtis Falls Cafe before walking to Curtis Falls, which was a lovely interesting walk. However not much water in the falls, but scenery great. While having lunch was informed that the skywalk & rainforest was worth a visit I was so glad that I was given that advice, because it was a great walk, with interesting scenery & accessible if your mobile. After walking the Skywalk  we had afternoon tea in the Hilltop Restaurant which also was worth a visit."
great family day,what a greatway to spend the weekend. The scarecrow festival is a smash. it is very interesting seeing how much trouble some people go tomake their scaecrows. The shool entries are outstanding. I recommend this day out to everyone
"Curtis Falls, Tamborine Village","The weather was perfect for a very scenic drive up the mountain. Te falls were not flowing but we still enjoyed the walk up and down, taking some lovely photos. Afterwards we ad lunch at a cellar door/cafe in the main street, it was delicious."
"Take a day trip from Gold Coast, well worth it","about an hour and half from Gold Coast. What a great day out. Suggest going on Friday Saturday or Sunday. Less people during the week, but many shops not open. North Tamborine Mountain is a delightful arty township. So many shops and lovely friendly people. Lots of cafes and restaurants. You can potter around for hours. Get up there early so you can get a parking spot!!!! They disappear very early. We went from here to the skywalk.You can do the round trip through Oxenford and and come back through Nerang, just stunning sceneryl. You can see why it is called The Scenic Rim. Enjoy!!!!"
Gateway to the Scenic Rim,"Beautiful mix of rainforest, galleries, wineries and experiences. Great restaurants. Come watch the para gliders launch off the western side of the mountain and drift over the beautiful Scenic Rim. Leave the Mountain and travel west through the Scenic Rim region enjoying a wonderful mix of food, wine, arts, natural beauty and of course, the local hospitality.  Great photography everywhere."
Don't miss visiting The Mountain!,"Whether you live on the Gold Coast or are visiting, don't miss getting up to Mount Tamborine. The drive itself offers spectacular views back to the Gold Coast and out to the mountains. The township has so much on offer from great restaurants, a brewery, quirky shops, lovely walks, wineries, fudge makers and amazing views. There is always something happening up the mountain so make time for a day trip or stay overnight. Lots of accommodation. A 'must see' township. The Glow Worm caves are also worth visiting."
Awesome experience!,"Clean mountain, nice view of the sunset. Delicious food on the mountain. Well marked roads. Interesting trails with nice observation points."
Nice day out with visitors,Always a good place to take out-of-town visitors. Lots of interesting shops and plenty of good places to eat/drink. Good short walks can be taken at Curtis Falls or Tamborine Botanic Gardens
fantastic day out,"Having been living on the gold coast the last few years I love getting up this place for a day away from the coast.  It is such a quaint little town.  The main strip is Gallery Walk (took me a while to work that out the first time I went up there).  There are wineries, and fudge shops and chocolate shops along here.  At the end of the road is the mount tambourine brewery which do fantastic food (personally i think the best up there) and have live music some weekends.  Highly worth the trip :-)"
Spend the day in this tranquil little town.,"Beautiful, different, lovely cafes, interesting shops. Peaceful and just breathtaking.The Botanical gardens are well worth a visit."
Gallery Walk,My third trip back here and it still has not lost it's appeal. This last trip was on my own and Lunch and afternoon tea here was delightful. Well laid out and not cramped this area is the perfect tourist location. Take time to enjoy the views on the way up and back.The secret to this place is don't be in a hurry.
Must visit,"Has something for everyone. Food and beer, wine, bush walks and lovely shops. This was a highlight of my trip  :-)"
Tamborine Mountain.,"Just had a holiday on the Gold Coast, Queensland,Australia. One of the highlights was a visit to Mount Tamborine. Most enjoyable and is indeed a complete package  and a must for anyone visiting the area. There many attractions including: Hot Air Ballooning,The rainforest skywalk,A Boutique Brewery(with tasting) Cheese Factory (with tasting), A Golf Course,Glowm Worm Caves, A local produce Cooking School,Art and Craft Galleries,Walking Tracks(from 30 minutes to 1 hour),Waterfalls,Farmers Market,4 Winerys (with tasting) The Gallery walk with a host of Eateries and craft shops and local produce, There is a look-out that gives a magnificent view of the Gold Coast Area. One day is not sufficient to see all the attractions and there is ample accommodation available. The whole area is set in a National Park. A must do on the Bucket List.9from 30 minutes to one hour"
Amazing,"I went to the Gold Coast for the first time end of January to visit family after spending one week in Nelson, NZ. What a trip. Went to Tamborine Mountain with my Grandma. What a day. We did some shopping at the shopping village at the top and then did the skywalk. It was an amazing experience. Def recommend."
A must do.....,"Did the skywalk and was brilliant, and even the drive up there has a beautiful view so make sure you take the time so you can stop and enjoy the views along the way. There are many walking tracks for all levels of fitness. Also make sure you leave time to do the Gallery Walk on the way home, it is street shopping with unique shops. Just be wary that the GPS may take you on a bit of a drive, might pay to follow the signs."
"Worth a visit if not more than once! Beautiful, unspoilt place.","What a place, stunning waterfalls, a lovely walk, and such beautiful surroundings. There is an abundance of wild life, wide, well thought out pathways, which are also suitable for buggies and those in wheelchairs. There are toilets nearby, and a wonderful selection of cafés, local fudge shops etc all in easy walking range."
Worth a visit,"Tamborine Mountain is about an hour's drive from the Gold Coast  and is commonly referred to as the Hinterland. Technically it is not a mountain but a remnant rain forest plateau. It is generally several degrees cooler than surrounding countryside. There are several protected rain forest parks which have well maintained walking tracks. The most popular of these are at Curtis Falls, Palm Grove and Witches Falls. There are several quality wineries with cellar door sales, an award winning distillery, a cheese factory, a brewery and a few antique shops.  Gallery Walk is home to a large array of gift and art & craft shops as well as eateries. The panoramic eastern views from Tamborine to the coast and also the western views to the ranges  are absolutely stunning. There are many picnic spots with tables and some have barbeques. On the western side there is a take-off area for hang gliders and which gets very busy on weekends when the wind is right. Tamborine is well worth a day visit or even longer stay in local guest houses and B&B's. You wont be disappointed."
Beautiful,"This is a beautiful area of Australia well worth a vist.  Lots to do on the Mountain and near the Mountain.  Stunning view points over the gold coast.  Lots of lovely restaurants.  Waterfall, skywalk, gallery walk all worth a visit"
Nature at its best,"Visited Tamborine Mountain on a clear warm winters day. What a lovely place, lots to see and do. Markets were great along with watching the hang gliders. It you are after some scenery don't go to the sky walk, it is much too expensive for what you can get for free from one of the many bush walks."
Easy GET-AWAY!,"My wife and I have spent a number of pleasant times getting away from the bustle of the Gold Coast up on Tamborine Mountain.We always find it relaxing, refreshing and the fact that it's really only up the road, makes it really quite an easy get-away for us.You don't need to leave the mountain for anything once there, it's got everything you need, food, coffee, supplies and stuff to do like golf, walking, adventure, etc!"
High Country Excellence,"Tamborine Mountain, west of the Gold Coast, has some excellent lookouts and bush walks in the mountains. There are many walking trails of varied difficulty around the mountain. Obtain a brochure from any Information Centre, travel centre, or any accommodation office, and head up the mountain on any of three (steep) roads. There are many things to at Tamborine for all of the family. Take binoculars, water, camera, and good walking shoes... be prepared for an excellent day(s) in 'the high country'."
Beautiful scenery,I have always preferred Tambourine Mountain to the madness of Gold Coast. Of course there isn't much to do for children here but it is a peaceful place to rest in between the visits to the theme parks. We have bought some lovely paintings in the local gallery.
"Went once, tried again,failed","Went one day and did the skywalk. Very good. Decided to go again tovisit Tamborine itself but ""approved back burning"" and an unapproved forest fire meant we couldn't. We're sitting on our apartment balcony in Burleigh Heads and can't even see the mountains for smoke."
A nice alternative to the coast,"Tamborine Mountain is refreshingly cool and green, there are many boutique hotels and lots of B & B's so it makes for a great romantic get away or retreat to recharge the batteries. There probably isn't a whole lot to occupy the kids. Most of the shops along Gallery Walk are not kid friendly, however lovely to wander through and enjoy if you are not worried about rampaging toddlers. The lookouts are very nice and there are walks close by that are not too long and can be managed no matter what your fitness level is."
"Beautiful, serene.",Beautiful place. Lovely tourist shops. Polite locals. Worth a visit even just for the views. Fantastic bed and breakfasts.
Enjoyed leisurely surroundings,"For those looking for change from hustle bustle of city life, Tambourine mountains allows you to appreciate nature undisturbed. The many natural parks are alive with wild life, trees and plants. Many natural trails for exploring are well marked and graded to suit people of all level of fitness. Do not miss the shops at the Gallery walk which are picturesque with postcard looks."
Fantastic view!!,"From Brisbane, it takes only less then one hour.you can enjoy spectacular view and wonderfull wine at some winery.I went to Witches Falls winery with my mother and family. it only cost 6 dollers for each to try six different types of wine. my two small kids also enjoyed water fall in the mountain.You shold drop by some unique shops as well."
Nice place,"If you driving yourself,  the GPS could be a deceiving & you might just land at the base of the mountains like we did... you need to take the long road & thereafter take directions for Tambourine.The place is simply beautiful, wish we hadnt wasted lot of time finding it. Lust greenery & great scenary even while driving around. visit the cedar vineyard & the glow worm cave ...you can also visit these little shops around"
A local treasure,"Being local on the Gold Coast things can get a little boring when you do them over and over again. Tamborine Mountain never gets boring! Whether you go up for a coffee and muffin on a Sunday morning or you take visiting friends up there for a trip. There are fantastic lookouts, great food and wine, the cheese factory (FANTASTIC) and the infamous multi award winning distillery. Take a stroll down gallery walk and pop into the weird and wonderful shops. The cuckoo clock shop is one of my favorites."
Village Atmosphere on the Gold Coast,"Once again this place never fails to give you a great feeling , we have been here to the Mountain now at least 20 times , most just for the day as it is so close to the coast , and twice for weekends away , it is beautiful and has the atmosphere of other villages i have been to (Blackheath in the Blue Mountains) , although , Mt Tamborine isnt as cold LOL .what a really pleasant day , will definitely be back again. John and Gina ."
Fab view all the way round.,"Beautiful part of the gold coast. Loved the Gallery walk,bought great cheese from the factory shop. Moonshine madness liqueur which I have search for and had a lovely walk through Thunderbird park. Lovely day and then had a lovely nights sleep up there too."
views to remember,georges resturant for yummy lunch.walked the whole main street looking at all the great shops to visit.took hours as found too many to look at.great coffee shops.everything you can imagine to look at.a very good day out.takes all day.
Great Views and little village,"We only live down the road so we go here often to relax and check out the views whilst enjoying a picnic. There is a little village down the road which has lots of shops, cafes and the best fudge around. Would recommend to anyone to take a day to visit the whole area."
Great day trip,"I had a great day out here. There are some really nice walks through the rainforest. We did the Curtis Falls one, and one member of our group ended up with a leech on him which was very exciting, but did no lasting damage. The gallery walk is a tourist trap but worth a quick stroll to have a look. We went to the bakery and grabbed some food for a picnic at the viewpoint. The drive up there from surfers paradise is very scenic."
Amazing,This place is beautiful I would go here again you would definitely want to go here beautiful sites and places to be and go visit
Mount Tamborine,"Wow! what a great place to visit..Only if you like wine, art, food, views. Try to get a bus up there with a tour as we hired a car. The only problem with driving is my wife sampled wines all day...and i had to drive..Should have stayed the night.."
Day Trip,"Had a great trip to Tamborine Mountain. Had great weather, tour guide was great and there was only four people on the tour."
Top venue and a place for Devonshire Tea plus Glow Worms,"We had a sensational day looking at White cuckoo clocks ,cottages and lunch at Georges Also went to a winery and saw the Glow worm caves.Lovely fresh air thrown in"
Love the markets,"What isn't there to love about our beautiful rain forest? There are so many great shops to browse through and great places to eat. Don't forget to check out the markets on the second Sunday of the month. I love the art galleries and the canopy walk, not to mention all the great bush walks you can do to see the waterfalls and amazing birdlife."
For yuppies!,"After spending awhile trying to FIND the right place (maps very confusing) we spent the day in Tamborine Mountain looking at all the little shops down the main strip.Did not buy one thing. Have you got $300 to spend on a little piece of glass? How about $100 for a t-shirt? Really, anyone who buys the crap up in that mountain obviously has got all the money in the world to just blow on pieces of junk. Won't be returning to the shops here, but one day I will check out the Glow Worms and hopefully that will be an improvement."
Confusing,"Taken a day to go to the famous vineries in tambourine mountains ,signs are confusing ,even locals coud not direct us yet alone GPS . Find the glow worm place also stated its a vinery .Lady at the vinery was rude and painful.No tasting at all ,if u like $ 5 to taste some home made liqueur ,but no vine tasting .needless to say we didn't purchase.coud not find the shopping strip that is stated in the tourist brochure ,left disappointed .the view was breathtaking .1 for tambourine mountain directions ."
Glow worm Caves,"Excellent. Well worth it.After the caves visit the surrounding park areas and walks.Cute little shops to look through, but some parking can be a bit of a hassel."
Tamborine Shopping Village,"It's a quaint little shopping village, with shops for all tastes (and bugdets!). Plenty to discover and plenty of cafes around to take a break from all the shopping!"
