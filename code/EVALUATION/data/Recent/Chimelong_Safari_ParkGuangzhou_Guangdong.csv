L❤️VED it!,Going to Chimelong Safari Park was the highlight of our trip to Guangzhou!  The animals are well taken care of and were super active when we arrived that morning!  The employees were so welcoming and seemed so happy to be there!  Please do not miss feeding the giraffes.  The park is blessed to have the only panda triplets in the world!
Lots of Animals,"There are lots of animals and many exhibits to check out. It will take a long time to see everything so do plan to spend the whole day there. It was a huge surprise to see all the animals here. We would recommend doing the ""safari train"" when the lineups are short as it is included with the ticket price and it is very cool seeing the animals out in the open.The only downsides are the long line ups for the cable cars and the food quality is not that great in the park. Refreshments and ice cream is cheap.Closest metro station is Hanxi Changlong."
Chimelong paradise Park... ,"Chimelong is an amazing place to enjoy and explore. The park is massive and there isn't enough time in the day to go through all the rides.. The fun doesn't stop here.. From 3d to 5d theatres and a variety of roller-coaster rides, your day at the park is filled with plenty of great features such as water features and dance party around the other end.. Truly phenomenal experience..."
Great to have fun but walk too much,"This park is very interesting, cable car and train,but the park is too huge ,after the whole day ,we are tired and exhausted,but it's good for kids."
Best animal Park ever alot of walking,"This is amomst or was one of the best places to visit if u like animals, sadly be ause if the current circumstances, no one can go in or out of China, I wonder people can look after themselves as much as possable, told not to travel unless necessary, so what is happening to the wonderful wildlife parks, chimelong has the most amazing animal collection, in one space, its like Disney only for animals, animals need humans to look after them, to train them, to feed them, if no one turns up for work, how will they live"
Interesting but too crouded,"Visiting the zoo was a pleasant experience as it is spacious, new and well organized. But it is too crouded (maybe because we went there on Saturday). We had to queue for about an hour for the cable car and more than half an hour for safari. It was a bit annoying, but it is the problem of all similar parks."
Over Rated Over Priced Over Populated ,It's like a second rate zoo on steroids. Animals kept in poor conditions along with  rather small enclosures.There's a souvenir shop at every attraction so with two small children they get some of your coin eventually. We found it some what over crowded with alot of pushing and shoving however the children did not mind as they thought it was some kind of game and held their own.I would not go again due to the above.Regards S
Great for children but too many merchandising ,"We went there on January 2020 with 2 children 2 and 5. (For being low season there was no queuing) You can go directly per metro and enter in the south entrance. All by all the experience was great! But my heart broken when we saw the pandas in such a poor condition and really placed as THE attraction of the safari. No respect for the animals,  very noisy lots of shops before and after each area, and noisy music. By chance we ended the safari with the train and this part was beautiful. Then a  big walk through dinosaurs (funny) monkeys reptiles exotic birds. All by all very nice and a must do with children’s in Guangzhou. But noisy and lots of plastics toys selling. It is more like a Disney world for animals rather than an ecological and respectful area for animals."
Great Park Experience!,Full day required to see all the animals at this park.  Our children were thoroughly entertained here.  The highlight for them was feeding the giraffes!
Great day out for the family,"Admission is a bit pricey, but once inside you will know it's worth it. This a large zoo with cable car and safari train included in the entry fee.  Lots of animals, clean and nice forest scapes.  The animal nursery was an unexpected but excellent experience.  Saw the brown bears close up (almost too close), and it was awesome.Food is very expensive, so it might be a good idea to BYO.  Go on a weekday to avoid the queues"
Absolutely amazing ,"The safari park is amazing! A great zoo, but way more than that. The cable car and train and worth the whole price of admission. Even as English only speakers we had no problem. Staying at the chimelong hotel was a big benefit...express line for the big experiences."
Very impressed definitely one of the best zoos I’ve ever been to,Had zero expectations going into it but came away very very impressed. The biggest thing is the sheer number of animals they have. Most zoo’s will have 2-3 of each type but there were literally tens of each type. The other thing is the safari - you can drive in yourself ( or hire a taxi ) and see the animals up close. Great treat with kids! The park was too big for my 2 and 4 yr olds so we will definitely be back some day
Best zoo!,"I've been to a lot of zoos and by far this is the best. What separates this zoo from the rest is how unbelievably close you can be with the animals. The animals in the zoo are very diverse and plenty as well, and the crowd could have been much worse on a Saturday. The highlight of our trip were the pandas and the safari tram ride. Some notes as well below.- If tickets were bought online, it must be exchanged with a real ticket prior admission.- Price of food (main meal) ranges from 60-80 RMB.- Waiting time for cable car ride during our visit was 45 minutes (11AM on a Saturday). We didn't ride one during our trip.- Tram ride was very much worth it despite a long queue. Waiting time wasn't too bad since the tram has a high capacity and trams were frequent. Sit on the right side as most animals are on the right (sitting on the left isn't too bad).- No animal shows here, only scheduled expert talks.- You can easily spend a day here with kids."
Best zoo,"Chimelong safari park was easy to get to using public transportation for our hotel in Tianhe district.  Our kids (7 and 5) had so much fun seeing all the animals like camels, giraffe, elephants, white tigers, flamingos, parrots, rhino, kangaroos, koala and much much much more.  Their favorite were the pandas.   It was not hard to spot them as there were many. The tram and gondola cable car are a must and the line wasn’t too long for us on a Wednesday. We were lucky because kids are free for the month of December. However admission is reasonable between $200-300 CNY,  highly recommend for anyone especially children."
Sunday Half Day Trip,"Took a Sunday afternoon off and went to the zoo with the kids, upon their request.  Surprisingly, after living here for over a year, this was my first time to Chimelong zoo.  I've driven by it a few times and even attend a few weddings at the hotel, but this was my first time at the zoo.  Overall, I'd have to say it was a great experience.  First, it was not crowded and the lines were very manageable.  Second, the weather was nice a cool, so it made walking around the huge park easier.  There were plenty of animals to see and majority of the animals we saw were quite active.  What I appreciated were the number of staff around to keep the park clean and in order.  The kids had fun watching the monkeys, taking the safari train ride, and watching the 4D movie.  We could've easily spent 3 to 4 more hours there, but since it was a half day trip we only explored a portion of the park.  I'd definitely take my kids and other family members visiting back to the zoo."
perfect,it was a good place and full of fun. I will visit this place for sure in the future. but this time I'll go there in summer. I think it will be much funner.
Great park,Excellent day for everyone. It is big and there is lots to see. Budget a full day there. Some went in the the part of the park where you drive in using a taxi.
Many lovely animals,"I have seen this scenic spot in the small program Canton Laowai, which is very suitable for families to see, take children to see all kinds of animals and this visit can go to water park and happy world, all in the same area like the zoo must go to see"
Excellent zoo with some very special animals,"Great and very large zoo. The pandas, kualas, and tigers are very impressive. The reason ride was somewhat disappointing. Many stops with seemingly too long explanations in Chinese only, and quite a long queue"
Huge place,The place is so huge. The place isn't that crowded when we were there. The animal seemed to be having a huge compound for themselves. Some animals were roaming freely around the public area.
Cool circus show,"If u bring children to guangzhou , you must go to this park, ini this park so may thing to do with family.And at the night must go to show circus"
Overrated,Stayed at the hotel and it was a million crying kids.  We then went to park and it was not worth the time.  Poorly done and not easy to get to Canton Fair
My Brother Panda ,The entrance ticket is 300 yuans on week days and 350 yuans on weekends or any national holidays which seems a bit expensive to me. The best things I enjoyed here are pandas and giraffes.
Must go attraction in Guangzhou,"Was amazed by how big this safari zoo is. We entered from the south entrance and took the free cable car to the north entrance where we experienced the safari on wheels (free train ride). In total we took the train 2 times and it was very much worth it with the number of animals we can see along the way. The encounters are quite close as well. Do take note all the introductions by zoo guide on the train is in mandarin. They have a huge pandas enclosure where the famous triplets (characters in Kungfu Panda 3) are housed. There are feeding experiences as well for giraffe, bringing us up close. Overall loved the safari trip and highly recommended in Guangzhou."
Great experience,This is definitely worth the visit. You get to see such a big variety of animals in an very nice environment. The animals are well looked after and the park is very clean and neat. Why travel to Chengdu if you can experience Pandas up close without the crowds at this amazing park. This is an excellent place to visit with your family and with your partner / friends.
cruel to animals,"the zoo was 100 per cent NOT worthwhile to visit.the adorable white tigers were underweight, with their rib bones showing, and they were made to perform.the chimps are suck in an incedibly small enclosure of just a few trees where they could escape or attack.the circus had animals, and for a start it is cruel to make animals perform and secondly a waste of money.the animals are punished by smaking and kicking just for moving and grabbing leaves of trees.DO NOT GO IF ANIMAL LOVER, LIKE ME"
oh dear! waste of money!,we had a lot of problems getting to the zoo and we needed bus to get to the hotel which was a squash and the chimps enclosure was small and they could escape and attack the visitors and its cruel to put animals in small places and its also cruel to make animals perform in circuses too expensive the skylift not open
A cross between a Safari Park and a Zoo.,"Self drive through Safari tour or by train.  Then go into the zoo to see the rest of the animals. Great closeup encounters with babies in the nursery area, then onto White Tigers, Pandas and giraffes.Spectacular place, well looked after and not too crowded."
very good circus,"The safari is very good and it has a circus in the evening which is must see. There are many spices of  animals, good for kids"
Excellent zoo ,"First time for me to visit any zoos in China and it impressed me big time! This is a great way to visit the zoo- in AC and at your whole pace. You don’t have to be in the sun and walk 10K steps to see different animal! I personally much prefer this than any other zoo, by the way it’s a well managed zoo too!"
Exceptional collection of wildlife,"Take that shuttle service whenever you can. Otherwise, it would have been a lot of walking for us on a sunny, hot, humid August day. There are many types of free range animals here. Likely many animals are happier than those at the zoo. The panda area has the most sightseers. Can take a while to get to. We took a Didi taxi ride. It took about 45 minutes, which will be impacted by your starting point and traffic."
Awesome place - Experience is similar to watching Jurasic park live,"What a place.. Hats off to Chimelong team, how wonderfully they have maintained such a huge space inside the busy city of Guangzhow, life time experience, so many wild animals at arms throw distance, china is amazing country and so its people are. Loved the park.. its a must visit."
Great Place for Holiday,"August is summer. the place is easy to find. Theres a few places like Theme park,waterpark and Zoo. I only go to Zoo and Theme Park. The Zoo is ok but the Way inside quite confusing mostly its oneway path. So once u take that path no wayback. The food there is quite expensive. Mostly the meal is 88 RMB. But i found Noodle Store at Chimelong Paradise only 58 RMB and its good. Overall its good place to have holiday with kids"
Super Fun,"Beautiful place, well kept, interesting and fun safari, mainly for kids. Was great driving our car inside and also important to choose the right time to avoid too many people. Unfortunately, no good food to be found inside so, better eat and go on a full stomach."
something uniqe in middle of the city,this zoo is big enough with safari and it has cable care routes to go through the wildlife . as you know Panda is only related to china and in center of the china you can find panda .also in this Zoo you can see panda as well .don't feed the animals please
Great place,"Classic Chinese ZOO are really in bad condition. But this place is a must to visit!!! Beautiful scenery, habitats and place for animals.Throughout the day, there are several shows, where small and large animals, which are well trained come and go to the stage. But see the timetable when you enter. It's easy to spend there whole day."
a place to know more about animals,"It has two cable car routes.  We took the route to travel around the park.  However, it was on a sizzling hot day, so we did not see the animals which are supposed to be offered to the cable car passengers to see, except the safari and the swan lake.It offers wheelchair and baby trolley rental services, so it is suitable for the elderly and toddlers.For the walking trail part, it is narrow so the car services cannot approach those animal captivity places.  Walking around is the wise choice for seeing the animals in the captivity part."
Awesome,"This is a must if you go to Guangzhou, great for all ages then add in the circus while you are there a fantastic days adventure."
Great place to take your kid,"The park had exceeded our expectations, my daughter even said its better than Singapore Zoo that we visited 2 years ago. I highly recommended to take the kids to visit the Park off-peak season."
A great destination for adults and children!,We were recommended this place by someone who has actually visited it before and it lived up to the name. For a mother and child trip I couldn't have picked a better destination. We spent an entire day here and will definitely make a visit sometime in the future. The animals looked very healthy and information about them and their care is displayed in english. The cable car rides as well as the mini train were great fun and a must do. Tips: 1. Get there early. Take the Chimelong shuttle safari bus (white) from metro exit E not A as mentioned elsewhere. E exit is in the park and it's a long walk to the Safari park entrance.2. Plenty of Mosquito repellent.3. Plenty of water and sunscreen4. Read the animal show timings and plan your day well.5. If your children are older try staying in the chimelong hotel and doing the other parks as they are equally good!
Very nice but not at weekends,It’s a great place for spending your time make sure to have enough time to visit every where. If you want to walk keep enough water and food with you specially if you are vegetarian. At weekends there are lots of locals everywhere shouting and this makes animals uncomfortable. We could not see the pandas because there were lots of noise.
The most beautiful place in China,"I love this place, we did everything while staying here, we had safaris, ate in the restaurant with tigers sitting behind glass right next to us.Flamingos wandering around the park, monkeys, birds everywhere, it was just magical.The theme park is there too.When you enter for the first time, the decor is just like something out of Africa.There were dancers out the front to greet up too.The rooms are nice too, I feel very lucky to have stayed here.Well worth the money."
A treat to visit ,Huge park. Cable car was fun. Safari ટ્રેન takes you close to animals. Panda experience was awesome &  feeding animals was a treat for kids..
Great Panda Exhibit,We took a tram ride around the park and saw numerous animals. The best part of our visit was the panda exhibit. We saw at least 10 pandas including two juveniles. Especially liked that their enclosures appeared spacious. We also went on the aerial tram for a nice view of the park.
A place not comparable with any other of its kind.,"The place is extraordinary. It is a very big jungle with a big quantity of interesting animals. Of all of them there are many. This is not a place to present a list, but I must mention the lovable Panda Bears!"
My favourite in the chimelong brand,"Really fantastic zoo and safari area, one if the best I have ever visited in the world. So many animals you don't see elsewhere, in nice (spacious!) habitats. The pandas and white tigers are nice, I guess they are the main attraction for most people - me, I really like the monkeys. And they have a huge area for that. Rhesus monkey, golden snub-nosed monkeys, proboscis (""big nose"") monkeys, gibbons, ... I could spend hours watching them play and so could my kids. Highly recommended, and definitely worth every yuan."
My visit to Chimelong Safari Park,"We visited Chimelong Safari Park on our recent trip to Guangzhou on 5May 2019. The Chimelong resort provides a free shuttle bus from the Chimelong metro station. The Safari Park is a hugh park that have a zoo, drive in park and a cable car that straddles around the park and gives you a bird's eye view of the park. The admission fee is on the high side equivalent to a theme park rate of Hongkong and Shanghai. We spent about 5 hours walking through the whole park and enjoying the the animals and the aerial view and shows. There is a discount on the admission fees if you purchase together with the Chimelong International Circus show. There are also food outlets within the park. Overall, it was a safari park worth visiting when in Guangzhou. The resort also boast of a theme park within the complex."
Рandas and koala bears do not need advertising!,"Planned visit in the morning, the zoo is just huge and you can walk all day.Be sure to visit the show with animals - they are satisfied every hour and it is very interesting.And pandas and koala bears do not need advertising!"
"CHIMELONG SAFARI PARK, GUANGZHOU, CHINA","This is being touted as one of the MUST SEE sights in Guangzhou, China. The Park belongs to the Chimelong Group, which invested heavily both in Guangzhou and Zhuhai. There are two tourists spots in Guangzhou alone. Safari Park is one of them. The Park situated on the outskirt of Guangzhou, But can easily reached by public and private transportation. Visitors can also drive their own vehicles around the Park. However, almost all tour agents in Guangzhou will offer packaged TOURS to the Park. The animals are on OPEN CONCEPT; as in the case of SINGAPORE , LONDON....ZOOS. The Pride of the Park lies with the TRIPLE Pandas born while in the Park enclosure!!! THE white tiger takes a second place in popularity. The other animals are just SO SO , Nothing exotic !!! NO FOOD nor BEVERAGES from OUTSIDE are allowed into the park: SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PRICES FOR THE FOOD AND BEVERAGES ARE VERY HIGH !!! For example, the popular Hainanese chicken rice costs RMB 99.00 (S$20.00) per plate, as compare to that in Singapore it is ONLY S$4 per plate. Visit it just for the sake of HAVE BEEN !!!"
Chimelong safari park experience,"After visiting for the entire day and seeing most of the park, here’s a few pros and cons I noticed from the visitPros1)The place is relatively clean (including toilets) and well maintained and have many well placed amenities2) Lots of white tigers, koala bears, pandas, giraffes, elephants and monkeys as their main attractions3) Close encounter with all their animals either thru a fence, glass or the open space safari ride encounter4) Many signage (animal names and description, park directions and amenities) are in English5) Many entertaining rides, 4D theatre, free safari rides, cable car options, animal showsCons1) Manipulation by the park where all the visitors have to pass thru the park’s gift shop after they finish viewing animals in an area2) When the majority of park visitors encountered rain and step into the gift shop, it makes the floors super dirty and affects the shopping experience when cleaning attendants don’t clean up the place in time3) Many visitors have bad behaviours (encountering kids peeing at the sidewalk of park, tapping on the glass vigorously to raise the attention of the animals, talking loudly everywhere they go even when the signage mention not to disturb the animal as they get frighten easily)4) The paid safari ride has a guide speaking in one language at a time and it’s hard for the rest to follow if they can’t understand very well. There’s no tv subtitles in English and the outdoor signage is poor. There’s no names attached to suggest what is the name of the animal except from the guide and it’s a language you barely understand5) Unbalanced huge attention on white tigers, pandas and koala bears and no animals like polar bears & penguins etc6) Lastly here’s the most important reason why this park is good on entertainment for visitors but not respected as a world class zoo. They don’t place emphasis on providing general knowledge for the public on the animals and instead give importance to trival facts like how some pandas give birth to triplets and how they grew up and what is their names etc.. and another part where they mentioned importing some 8 white tigers and how some tigers have given birth multiple times and have many niece and nephews etc... <facepalm>Actually I find this park very entertaining and if it’s just based on entertainment values it’s really awesome but judge it like a zoo and it falls short on many aspect."
have to do,"it was rainy day when we visited the park, but still enjoined a lot , i suggest to go in there......"
Best Enjoyment Park,Just the net place to my office...The best place for the kids and the family...A lot of Hotels cheap and expensive...A lot of enjoyment...few days worth trip...A must go to visit...
Not English friendly /is complicated,"The relationship between tourism and foreign tourist is challenged not only by cultural procedures but also by the lacking  of language training. Checking in or purchasing lunch or breafast tickets can be very challenging with the lacking of customer service English speakers . On the plus side buffet and service leaves nothing to desire as asian regards eating as top of the needs pyramid.  The plush dinner venue is peared with the sight of playful  white tigers and pink flamingos . I cannot denied feeling guilty for enjoying this view at the exchange this beautiful creatures in captivity.  Another topic was accepting credit US cards which seemed inconsistent,  within the resort some places did allowed the transaction go through while others failed. While arriving to the train station if you did not prepared a pickup just walk outside to the outmust (closer is for local city) taxi line and present the brochure of the resort to the driver.  Fee is aprox 30-40 yuan. Other options will results into higher fees."
Weekend visit,We went to Chimelong Safari Park with our 5 year old and two year old sons. They had a lot of fun seeing the animals up close riding the truck train. Make sure to sit on right side as most of the animals were on that side.They enjoyed the tram across the safari park.Lots of walking to see all animals and shows.Bring water to cool down and snacks to eat.Each animal exhibit exit goes conveniently goes through a gift shop.We recommend visiting the safari park.
Worth visiting,"On a warm day it really was a unique experience , you can drive in with your own ride as well as on a safari coach,lots of interesting animals in a well organized habitat"
the price is too expensive,it is indeed the biggest safari park on guangzhou. but the price is too expensive. its quite big and got a lot of animal inside. we didnt manage to enter as the price is too expensive
You need a full day to make the most of your experience,"The first tip to offer you is to look for a combo ticket wherever possible. The parks have an annual card that costs in the range of 600 RMB, which would pay for itself if you went to the Chimelong complex three times over the course of one year. But if you cannot justify that purchase, know that you will be offered a a discount if you purchase in combination with something else, say the Circus, for example.Next tip - the Safari Park has north and south gates. The shuttle buses back to the subway are to the north side, and the south exit leads you to the circus and one of the hotels (it is good to know when planning your day)Do not miss the safari on wheels: this was our most enjoyable part, being able to get close enough to the wildlife to take great photos!There are also a number of sky trams that glide over the park. This may be your thing but my fear of heights would have made it distracting for me.A great place to take your family, but expect to spend a lot of money that day. This was our most expensive day in Guangzhou"
Great!,"Great experience! Safari on weels is must try! Friendly english speaking stuff. Restaurants and toilets all around. We were at CNY, so there was crowd, but worth visiting."
Lots to see!,I’ve been here a few times and I absolutely love it! There’s so much to see and everything is very well organized! I highly recommend taking the safari and feeding the giraffes and elephants!
Beautiful park,"Its a big area with skylift to get an overwiev, and train and cars to thavel to the safari area. The zoo area is well maintained and clean, and the animals look like they like living their relaxed life there. Souvenirstore on the track after every theme, and a natural route to cover all the themes and areas works good. Make sure to have alot of time, i had to run at the end to catch a flight, but could easy go back and spend a whole day or more in the area. Lays very close to paradice park wich i also will visit on my next travel to guangzou."
nice park but uncivilised crowd,"the park is great.nice and 5 stars graded zoo.we went during cny which is china's biggest holiday. the crowd was massive and we can't really view the animals well. we were fine with it till the white tiger's closure. the crowd pushes so much that 1 kid almost fell inside the den! the staff shouted and the daddy who gives the piggy ride too was furious! the unknown pusher was nowhere to be seen! the next incident was some kids threw her balloon giraffee to the panda!the monkey feeding area was disastrous! we saw cigrattes and other rubbish inside their closure!!!!then, we even saw a grown up girl (about 6-8 years old?) pee on the floor with the urine flowing down the pathway (the mother actually encouraged her to pee on the hill) it was a pathway with not much crowd but there are people walking past them n they just do it without bother! toilet was like not far from that spot too. After that, we realised every pillar at the resting area is wet even though it is not raining. was it pee or what.. we simply don't know.dont get me wrong but my family love the park and the animals look healthy and the park was well kept. just the crowd we depised of. im giving 5 stars cuz of the healthy animals and amazing landscape for their closures."
Interesting,"The place was better than I expected before my visit. The animals seemed healthy and the environment was well-maintained. The white tigers and pandas were, in my opinion, the star attractions. Worth a visit if you’re in Guangzhou and like animals."
Overrated and expensive,"Only visit if you have children and go on a weekday. We went today it was extremely crowded and unpleasant. We bought tickets online they were $70AUD each plus we spent another $20AUD each on a small meal and drink, massive rip off! Cable car ride costs another 150RMB so we decided to skip, line for the safari ride was also extremely long so we decided to skip that too (not sure if you have to pay additional for that). This is such a basic zoo and it's so commercial this place is all about making $$ you can't exit any attraction without them forcing you out through a gift shop. If you are well travelled and have limited time in Guangzhou you can skip this, it is not a must-see attraction and is definitely not comparable to Singapore Safari. I don't even understand why it's listed as a top attraction on tripadvisot. It was a nice day I would have preferred taking a walk at a nice park instead of squished in a zoo full of Chinese people."
Choose A Week to do this,"So big. We came at the opening hour and went straight to the train. Our guide told us that we HAD to do it. The line took one hour to get through and with exception to the white tigers and llamas, mostly the same animals as in any zoo. Definitely do everything else and bring tons of money. Sooooooooooooo fun. Definitely not a day trip."
A Very Good Place for the Family,"This ""Safari"" Park is really a high class zoo but marketed and run more like a theme park, similar to Australia Zoo, but not as classy. There were many areas to visit and most of the walking trails were very well themed. Many animals were out in the open and some actually interacted with people. There was even a Swan Flyover in the ""Swan Lake"" area.One of the activities was a safari drive on a long tram that took you through several lands to see Kangaroo, Red Deer, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Hippos, Giraffe, Wildebeast, Bush Bucks, Oryx, and many others. The areas were well kept, but I felt the drive was too fast and did not give me the chance to take in the animals. Of course in typical Chinese fashion, the trams were also fill as full as possible, so people were squeezed into the trams.The Jurassic Forest was intersting. It had some good animatronics, but not as good as Disney Animatronics or ILM, think Jurassic Park (1993). Many of the features were well maintained and the areas were kept clean.One concern I have is that there are no barriers to keep people away from the glass walls. There are signs on every plate of glass that says ""No tapping on Glass"" and ""No Climbing"" in English and Chinese. Still kids were climbing on the walls and slamming thier hands on the glass. One parent even placed his child in the window of the Chimpanzee enclosure. The child was makining full body motion that the child did not know was a challenge to a male chimpanzee. The chimpanzee charged the glass and you could hear it hit the glass so hard I thought could have broken if hit a 2nd time. People just laughed about it, but that was not a good situation and never should have happened. This behavior was seen all over the park as there are no barriers to keep people from getting too close to the glass abd preventing children from climbing on the ledges and getting in the windows. This is a major liability and accident waiting to happen.My concern over the behavior of local guests at these enclosures with glass walls is why I can't give it a 5 Star rating. There was also a complete childrens area that has rides and a 4D Theatre that was quite entertaining."
Panda and white tigers are so many and adorable,"We took the train and saw safari animals in the open. We just wish we could have drove our own car so we can stop and take pictures. They allow private vehicles to enter and take the same road with the train. The train uses gasoline so the smell is nauseating. However, the sights of many small white tigers playing and observing panda playing makes the trip worth it after all. It's not a big park but I have some much fun watching panda and playing tiger cubs."
Just Huge ,"We arrived there at 1pm and it was not so crowded, liked very much with both little shuttle train and the cabin in the sky. Panda were cute, most animal looked peaceful, unlike some of the zoo in Thailand or China, you can tell if they are enjoying the environment. It was worth to go"
nice safari,"We visited this Zoo with friends by weekend, the zoo was large and with so many animals, amzaing place."
If you do nothing else - Go here !!,"What a fantastic day out, the whole family said it was the best day ever. The place is huge, and has just about every animal you can think of (not polar ones).It took maybe 6 hours to go around, with very few people.The animals are very close to you, and seem very well treated. The Pandas are worth the trip alone."
My favourite place in GZ,"This park's  divided in 2 areas: zoo as we know it and safari. In the zoo we saw sleeping koalas, joyful flamingos, smiling elephants, curious giraffes and national love of Chinese people - pandas. The only panda triplets (Mengmeng, Shuaishuai and Kuku) live here. Special train will take you to the safari-park, be ready to take a seat in the end of it to get wide viewing angle 🕵️I'm not sure, what impressed me most - wild animals or fake dinosaurs 😂 They looked so natural and scaring.When you feel tired take cableway to enjoy views from the air (the price included in the ticket)If you're in Guangzhou, you definitely should visit this park."
Very big zoo,"Its a very biggg park. The animal collection is pretty complete, they have pandas and lots of tigers, there’s also this jurassic park filled with look alive dinosaur robot,  the entry price is pretty expensive and the food too, but its worth to visit dont forget to try the sky train where you can view the animal from above"
World class ZOO,"We completely love Chimelong park Guangzhou. This was our third visit and probably the best. The main reason was lack of people. Fortunately we have chosen the right time (weekdays before Christmas). The new cable car, safari train, private cars or just walking around will give you enough opportunities to explore all animals and plants from different angles."
An Excellent Zoo Experience,"Once you accept you are visiting a zoo and will be seeing animals in a captive environment then as an experience Chimelong was very good.Not being a fan of zoos in general and having been a to some horrible ones Chimelong was very good.  The enclosures were of a reasonable size and comparable to those in Singapore and Melbourne, as was the park experience as a whole.  The animal shows were good and informative, but they were shows and animals were performing.The animals did not seem to be malnourished as some other posts from a few years back so probably something they have addressed.  The cable car and train ride safaris were great but a do not queue up for the Carnival cable car ride, it is basically the same as the cable car but at the mid section station there are some dancers...that’s it...not worth the wait or billing.With a 5 year old and 1 year old, they had a great time the facilities were good although the food was overpriced and not great but this is a theme park so to be expected.As a long time resident in China this was one of the best parks I have been too."
The Best Safari Park,We visited the Chimelong Safari Park for a whole day and the experience was awesome. The best animal park I have ever visited. My favorites were the pandas and the white tigers. I really recommend to take the swan lake cable car and then the train to see the big animals roaming freely.
Chimelong Safari Park,"Our main purpose for visiting was to see and admire the giant pandas. We all loved watching them sit, eat and walk around their enclosures. Our first day we went in the afternoon which was a little busy, while the next morning we arrived early and there were few visitors in the Panda Toontown area.The 4D theatre was a fun cartoon adventure. It was the best 4D theatre we have experienced with many special effects. There were also a few small rides in the park for the kids to enjoy, although our 2 year old did not many height restrictions on some.The aerial cable car was an easy way to gain an overview of the park. We pre-purchased our safari park tickets on-line at time of booking at the Chimelong Panda Hotel (highly recommend this hotel!). There is two day validity on each safari ticket."
Good safari ,Its very large safari park. Very nice to walk with very wide path. Every pavilion larfe enough to accommodate the visitors. The inside transportation is many choices such as mini train to explore African animal or just cable cars to get the top view
great place to visit,"this is a must do when you visit Guangzhou,very interesting and cable car is excellent,worthwhile to go"
Healthy Animals,I love how the animals are treated well. I also like that the place has a lot of sitting areas. The cable car and train ride is the most convenient way to tour the park.
Unique experience in Guangzhou,"Large park with 2 separate sections, walking section and drive-in section.Even when you don't have a car, you must take the 'Safari-on-wheels' ride to access the drive in section of the park. The ride is located at the North entrance and it is free.Two cable car lines available. Why must choose - take both if the queue is not long. The safari line is longer and more interesting. The rides are free too."
Safari ,"We took a taxi there from our hotel. Not knowing what to expect. After the trip we give it a thumbs up. Worth the time and money spent. The Safari is a huge place. We first rode on a tram for nearly an hour. Saw lots of animals roaming around freely. Special enclosures for white tigers, tigers, lions, wolves. Elephants, rhinos, hippos, etc. We walked for about 2 hours saw the Jurassic park, bird park, panda etc. toilets plentiful and very clean."
Must-visit attraction,"The park is huge and houses a wide array of animals in well-kept enclosures. When visiting, I would highly recommend taking the train ride which gives you a comprehensive view of most of the animals. Do take the glass-bottom cable car ride as well to view animals from a height. It'll lead you straight to the panda enclosure. Do note that outside food is not allowed. If visiting the park with elderly or children, it is wise to take the buggy for 30 yuan/person to avoid walking long distances."
Good day out ,"Really great day out. But be prepared to spend tons of money. Going on a weekend, tickets cost 350rmb, otherwise it’s 300. It has a great selection of animals and they are kept in well sized habitats. The design of the park isn’t so clear however and the food is very expensive and inedible. Some of the worst food I’ve had in my travels around Asia. Take your own food. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our day here."
Excellent Safari Experience ,"Outstanding experience where we saw animals roaming freely from the comfort of a tram or the vintage point from a cable car (both included in the tickets). Walking through the numerous enclosures brought us to many other fascinating animals. It is quite big and will take you a full day if you want to see everything. Take note of the various showtimes when you plan your route inside the park. You are not allowed to bring any food in. There is a counter for you to deposit food (free) or luggage if any (at a cost).Pre-book your tickets if you are going over weekend or public/school holidays. There is a package that includes the Chimelong International Circus (located near the South Gate, starts at 7.30pm), which is also a must-see. There are free shuttle buses that ply the north and south gates as well connect you to the nearby metro station. Didi (private hire car) is easily available through the app that brings you back and from the park."
pandas,if you like pandas then you will love this place. lots of cool animals to see and do not miss the swimming monkeys. coolest thing you will ever see. great zoo. a must see
"Lot of animals, visit by walk, car, train","Huge park, plenty of animals, many shows.+ nice place for kids, as there is no age limit to enjoy rides and shows- few places to eat, always pretty crowded, if visiting by car or train be prepared to have other visitors stopping between you and the animal you are trying to picture :)Arrange a private car/driver to drop and pick you up, as taxis will ask you an indecent amount of money to take you back. You can find amusement park, water park, circus just next to it."
Awesome!!,"This is by far the best safari park I have ever visited!! Well kept open enclosures, rare animals, free tram ride , cable car ride ...it has everything and more!! Highly recommend spending a whole day here"
excellent safari park,"lots of animals in this park. usually you would expect just 3 or 4 of each type of animals in each enclosure. this park has at least 10 pandas including the famous triplets panda. and at least 20 white tigers in different parts of the zoo. the best part has to be “safari on wheels” where you get to ride the tram free of charge and it drives you through half the park and get real close to the animals. do take the cable car as well for the nice views. the tickets are expensive though. RMB300 for adults! for the elderly above 65 yrs, ticket is RMB210 but you need some proof to show your age .. a photo of passport that you stored in your phone willdo."
Best animal collection,"It's not just a Zoo, they do their best all the time to make sure everyone is happy.Train, cable car, Jurassic park and dancing shows and a lot more."
Awesome!!! ,"The best zoo, I've ever visited. Animals are so fluffy, so beautiful, so clean!!! I have no words to describe my feelings. Must visit!!! You will start from monkeys, pandas and koalas, later use trap cabins to have a look from birds sight and use a train to be as much closer as it's possible to wild animals. If you want you can use vip cars to spend more time with tigers and bears in safari zone. My best wishes to this zoo and animals. Enjoy your time!!! And please go there for a whole day! Even 4 hours are not enough for enjoying!"
So So So Amazing Park,"The pandas, the dinosaurs and various animals are waiting for you. A whole day is needed to experience all the amusement locations in the park. This park enjoys a nickname of Guangzhou Disney World of Animal Kingdom. Bring your children to here, they will definitely love it."
One of the Best Zoo,Must visit place. Huge zoo. Plenty of animals. Worth your time and visit. Pandas are very cute. You can also feed the giraffes and the elephants.
AMAZING PLACE,"It's a wonderful place it's good to visit.I LOVE ALL THE WILD ANIMALS AND THE SCENERY.The cable car is worth to ride to see the animals on the field the zebra,girrafe and many more.I love the white tiger,panda triplets and the Elephant and the Koala as well."
Absolutely worth it !,"almost compares to Disney World’s Animal Kingdom, but for a much better price.  You will be worn out before you see everything, if it is even possible to see everything there in one day."
Worth a visit,"We visited Chimelong safari during our Guangzhou trip and were not disappointed. There are 4 highlights...safari on wheels, 4D animation panda story, Panda triplets and cable car. The safari on wheels is the best where you get to sit on an open toy train type vehicle and can see animals all around you who roam in the open. Those with personal cars can take their cars and stop by where ever they like. It was wonderful to see giraffe,zebra etc at a stone  throw distance  The only down side was the constant automated voice information in the tram in chinese as a result we were unable to understand anything. The cable car is next thing worth visiting and it gives a Jurraisic park feeling when you get a bird's eye view of the entire park. There was a long queue though, guests of Chimelong hotel do get priority every where in the safari.Another attraction is the world's only Panda triplets. There is good information about their birth and other details. There is a 4D animation 10min show as well, but a major disappointment was that everything is in Chinese no English subtitles even. Overall its a very well maintained park with healthy flora and fauna. Toilets are neat and clean. The eateries are few with very limited choices, no McD.There is a lot of rush, even though we went on a Monday. The queue at ticket counter was long and the person was too slow. On top of it, not speaking English added to the woes We paid 385RMB for combined ticket for safari and birds park.. though after visiting i would say birds park can be avoided.You need 4hrs to cover the safari park and be ready for a lot of walking. The souvenirs are ridiculously priced. It would be nice to have some English speaking staff and information in English during the safari to make it a better experience for non Chinese."
Great Zoo Themepark,This is the best zoo I have ever visited in China. In the safari on wheels you can drive a personal car through different animal habitats. There is a great cable car ride. The park is famous for white tigers and the world's only panda triplets. There is even a very touching 4D movie about the panda family that just opened.
My kind of park,"Very nice wonderful park, huge open spaces,beware of biting invest take lots of repellent, animals roam around freely, no bars allowed, you have cable car, Sarah buses, trams,if u have little ones take the safari buses, u have to pay extra ,but the distance and heat is often to much,i was the only European there in 5 days,it can b a bit of a cutler shock, but to see theses wonderful animals its so worth itNot lover of animal shows,but the white tiger show is memorising,and u have to watch it, its on every half hr,the white tigers,leap for food,and watch them diving into the water to play catchYou can feed the tigers for a fee ,and see the elephants,ostriches,zebra in there excludes,again no bars,parrots,giant pandas to name a few,if its a fun day you after,this is the placeYou can buy your tickets in advance,they have e machines so u can avoid the long ques otherwise Take cash,they do not use cards,only cash,plenty of it as you’ll need it ,but worth while yes,i was there everyday for 5daysOh warning ,your searched twice,so be warned there could b long delays,but so worth it"
So much more than a zoo!,"Pandas, tigers, elephants, giraffes and koalas to name but a few. Definitely worth a visit! It was highly educational and informative."
Outstanding!,One of the greatest Safari Parks / Zoos we have visited. Pandas! Say no more... not often you can see them in their natural environment
Great park for kids with cable car and safari !,"Fantastic park with many pandas (including triplets, a world exclusive), many white and golden tigers and plenty other unusual animals.You can table a cable car to go over the whole park and also a small train (or your own car if you have one) for a safari to see zebras, giraffes, etc.In addition to the animals, there are also a few rides for young children."
Well organised zoo park for families,"quite a surprise that such an old zoo park has been well organised and maintained.  Yes, lots of ppl during public holidays but a large park to wander around, no need to worry about crowds.  Lots to see and to buy, though food and suvenirs are all quite expensive.  WCs are easy to find and clean, water sinks are just along the road which is very considerate for kids.  there are guides at each site, telling the story or the habits of the animal, and friendly to answer your questions."
Makes good,It was a very good and makes me so attractive to the place which I really likes very much I was so happy
Great!,"This place is enormous and I loved that it came with a free cable car ride to see the animals from above! Unfortunately we arrived at 3 and were shoo’d out before 6 so we did not have enough time. Why do they close so early? They should be open till 7 at least. You really need 5 hours or more to see everything. This aside, the enclosures seemed big and humane and the animals had plenty of room. I liked how there were descriptions near the enclosures about how the zoo got the animals. I would go back here, although it was quite expensive for what it was."
This place is huge!,We walked around for 30mins then took the tram and cable car(because we gave up walking halfway!lol!). They have interesting attractions within the park itself. You will need to spend at least half a day here.
Okay i guess,"When I went here, everything was okay. There was even a tram ride with the animals running free, which was a great plus point. What went bad was that the tram ran over a deer, and back over it again. Ran over the same deer 3 times. Still cannot remove the image and sound of a deer being run over until now."
fun with the kids,a lot of animals but the weatehr was humaid. Also no halal food in the place and no english signs or even staff who can speak english
Not a safari it’s just a zoo,I was there to visit panda house but sadly it was sleeping For kids and not young ppl above 15 years
Just Awesome!,This safari park i would definitely recommend others to visit. It is well maintained and the Animals are truly taken care of. There is food court and drinking water facility at walk able distance. Kids will enjoy this place and everyone can have a great time
Gorgeous Animals,This is a huge park where animals are cared for amazingly well and are not stuck behind glass.  They are expansive spaces to live and roam in.Feeding the animals was amazing for our girls and a join to watch the interaction.No food can be taken into the park and we didn't actually eat there as we were too busy trying to get around the whole park.  Make sure you go when the park opens as it can get extremely busy even on a week day.Worth a visit if you love animals
Expensive fee 350 rmb person ,Expensive entry ticket 350 rmb per person which is contained with a few types of animal. Just panda is the most interesting.
Impressed and worth your visit!,"Visited this safari park with friends, thinking that it might just be another typical zoo. But i was really impressed by it. This park is really big and clean. You can easily spend the whole day there, so be there early! Anyway, be aware that the Chimelong (长隆 - pronounced as 'chang long') has an umbrella of several attractions including Water Park, Safari Park, Circus and Theme park etc. So, do follow the signs correctly to the Safari park. My local friends got the tickets online so we managed to avoid the long queue! One highlight not to miss is to visit the Safari on Wheels! Take the free train ride and as it moves through the safari zone, you get to view the animals roaming freely at such close proximity! A very good and surreal experience! Both adults and kids will love this! Alternatively, you can also rent the car and self drive. However, there is always a long queue of cars waiting to move to the different zones, so do consider if you want to rent. Taking the train ride might be a better and fuss-free option. Also, do take the cable car for an overview of the safari park! It's really an interesting and beautiful view up there. Of course, do not miss the super cute triplet pandas! Last but not least, the animals seemed very comfortable and well looked after. They are pretty active too! For some animals like elephants, you can buy their food to feed them too. Totally recommend it if you have a day to spare!"
Great zoo for families with children,"First let me give a summary review before getting to some specific points. The zoo is beautiful, well organized, and seems to treat the animals well. The park is very oriented toward children, but is very crowded.Some specific observations and pointers:1) I went on a weekday during summer vacation, and the crowds were significant. I can't even imagine what it would be like on the weekend. There is an option to buy express access to skip certain lines such as the train tour and the cable cars. Definitely worth it if you go during a crowded time. The crowds thinned after lunch time, so if you have multiple days to work with you might want to skip the morning and noon rush, which is also when it's the hottest.2) There is a lot of English, but the experience is not perfect. There are plenty of signs and information that are only in Chinese, so the best thing is to come with someone who speaks/reads Chinese. That having been said, even an English-only visitor will not be completely flummoxed, and can have an enjoyable experience.3) Do not expect a learning or scientific experience. This zoo is mostly for entertainment. Even on the train tour, or when it comes to the information provided by the park staff at specific exhibits, there is little information about animal behavior, environment, characteristics, etc. There is some information in Chinese, but not much. Being a San Diego native and having grown up at the San Diego Zoo, I am used to learning a few things while looking at the animals. Not here. For example, the full scientific names of the animals are usually not given in English. I'm not talking the Latin name. I just mean, it will say ""rhinoceros"" instead of ""southern white rhinoceros."" There is a whole animatronic dinosaur section, and all the dinosaurs seem to be simply lifted from Jurassic Park, scientific inaccuracies and all.4) ""Safari on Wheels"" - You can actually drive a car in through much of the park, where the animals are free to roam around. It's the exact same route that you can experience if you take the train ride. I would say that it could be worth it, especially in hot weather when you could use your car A/C to stay cool. However, most areas had a huge line of cars waiting to get to the parts to see the animals. So... consider carefully depending on the time of year/month/week/day etc."
Worth the Visit,Clean and very organized. Loved walking around. Food is all Chinese style and most Americans would not enjoy.
"A bit safari, more zoo.","Although some of this is more safari park, there is still a lot of typical zoo here. If you are looking for the animals in a more natural setting you can do better elsewhere, but the park does have a nice gondola system. Due to weather damage, two main corridors were blocked off making navigation a bit of a maze solving problem."
"Interesting concept, good for children","Take a tram or cable car. View the Safari from the air over in a cable car. Follow by tram to have a close up with the animals. Overall, an interesting concept and kids will enjoy the experience."
We love the panda so so much,"The park was huge and you can easily spend a whole day there. The park is filled with people that wanted to take the cable car first. There's special queue for hotel guests. We are not and properly have to wait for an hour. We decided to skip that first as we didn't want to spend time queuing and waiting. So we went to see the triplets panda instead. Wow... though it's our first time looking at the panda, we were captivated by them. There's many things to see in the park. We took the cable car only after lunch. There's a good choice for us. We only waited for 10 minutes. The train is also something not to be missed. Will suggest that they include English subtitles for the 4D show. Only thing that we didn't enjoy - food and drinks are expensive and they don't taste good. My son just has a bite of burger and refused to eat it. He said that it tasted funny."
Best animal park we have been to,"So the park is pretty expensive, and at first we wondered whether we had made the right decision. However, we were so impressed by the whole thing. You can easily spend a whole day here.The animals seemed happy and most had loads of space (especially compared to zoos, which we hate and never go to). A few times we weren't completely happy with the space for the animals, especially the baby animals which were sometimes in glass boxes. But overall, pretty good. There are a huge range of animals there, including pandas, tigers, giraffes, etc. The park also runs lots of breeding programmes for endangered animals, e.g. has the biggest population of white tigers in the world.There are lots of 'extras' in the park which are free, such as the cable car over the park and the safari train - we did both. The cable car was worth it, but we didn't feel the safari train added too much to the experience, so don't worry about that if you don't have time.It's really easy to get to the Park on the metro. Be aware that the Safari Park is one of many Chimelong attractions in the area, including a water park etc, so you need to follow signs to the safari park specifically (each has a separate entrance fee). You aren't allowed to bring your own food into the Park (they will search your bags) and the food for sale inside is pretty expensive! So eat a big breakfast if you don't want to buy expensive food."
Disney for animals,"The most exciting place to view animals, no bars alllowed, a lot of giant glass windows but outdoors for most animals the distances are far so if you’ve little ones and its hot there have strollers fior hire and trees a open mini bus that takes you to certain enclosures once you’ve bought your ticket, your ready to go,they also have safari on train cable car and wheels be prepared to que esspeally at the weekends i get its china sitting enjoying my lunch when one family whips the trousers down in front of me to change its nappies great except there are toilets nearby they just cant b bothered the safari buses are great but if u get the chance go either early in thre morning or late in afternoon otherwise they are asleep mostly well it is hot the white tiger show is mega amazing I s was asked how many times id seen it 3or4 so they got a suprise when i said12 they are magnificent to watch them dive for the food it gives them excersise and humans entertained the e ticket machine is easy to use in english and Chinese but apart from a few in custiomder services and the manager no one speaks english so make sure u get a map located at the entrance its free and show where u want to go, or google translate that helps if theres a internet connection wonderful happy customers and aHappy well looked after animals loved the elephants and the zebras you can for a price ride on zebra or a elephant if ur brave enough it was magical experiance i should no i was there for 6 days"
It’s more over a zoo ,"Visited with my 2 kids age 5 & 10 year old , place is good and very near to chimelong hotel . Extra discount to hotel residents, for 2 adult 2 kids below 1.5 mtr s cost is RMB 850 , kids below 1mtr is free . No vegetarian food available at this place . Make sure you have to walk a lot. Prefer to go early more , avoids afternoon. Strollers are available at entry point at RMB 100 for a day . In one day you can access as many time you can . Nice place for kids . Panda village , wheel on safari must take . For hotel residents preference is 1st ."
Go for it! Kiddos love it!,"Pandas, more pandas. I would call it a panda themed zoo  ;) very well sectioned and upkeep was high rated. Love the safari on wheels and cable car rides. A large park, do expect some walking for more coverage. Make good use of the cable car as you catch an eagle eyeview while riding along the lines drawing almost the entire perimeter of the park!"
Bandas are best!,"Park is nice and clean. It was little rainyday so there was no crowded and that was good!We took gondola over park, where you can see different animals. That was nice. But best thing was to see giant panda. They were cute, but cannot have thought: hoppfully they have been taken good care for!"
Perfect Family Day Trip,"The Chimelong Safari Park is a great place to spend your Sunday with the family. Quality of the attractions are great. You can see Giraffes, white Tigers, Panda Bears, Peacocks and a ton of other amazing animals. The area is vast, you can take a cable car to get around. Only down turn is that you can't enter with food, need to be purchased inside."
Closes at 6:30,We checked the timing at internet It said the closing time was 9But we reached at 7 and everything was closedGoogle must update the timing But place looked huge and beautiful A good option for tourists
Nice but shows not worth seeing except the white tigers half hourly feeding time,"First of all, they provide free bus shuttle from metro to the zoos and hotels. We went there on a weekday and it was off peak season. To us, it was crowded but to the Chinese, it wasn't. However, the queues move quite quickly. Although I read on the website that they close at 5.30pm, they closed at 5.00pm that day.The signs at the bus stops may not be right. We seem to have queued at the wrong queue on going back. It's better to ask but not many of them know english so it is better if you know some mandarin or cantonese.There is a display board with timing for the shows. We went for 1 and it was kiddish. We decided to skip the rest. There was nothing said about feeding the white tigers but since we were told by some friends, we went and it was splendid. The tigers are in a glass cage and the meats are dangled down to them in front of the pool (next to glass window) or on top of tree trunks. The tigers will therefore have to jump or climb to get their food. They rarely fight for it as they are given some every half hourly. I heard later that you can pet some baby white tigers too but we ran out of time.I will say one should go on their safari on wheels train before embarking on the rest of the zoo. This is really good and it goes through areas roamed freely by the wildebeast, giraffes, zebras, etc.Next comes the cable cars and you can see some of the animals quite well from it too.Then you should explore the areas where you're most interested in like the pandas, white tigers, etc. These pandas and the white tigers are the highlights of the Safari and not to be missed. To enjoy the place better, it is better to give yourselves more time. Most probably have a big brunch and make your way there."
Absolutely not worth the ticket price.,"I do realize that it's not listed as a zoo anywhere or do they even pretend to be a zoo, but you expect certain things with parks with animals. Overall, the experience is not worth the amount of time and annoyance to actually get to the place. It's way out in the middle of nothing and even if you drive, it's a considerable expenditure of time to just get to the ticket booth. On top of this, there isn't adequate signage to help the huge masses of people navigate this giant stretch of land. The entire park is smashed with people.The treatment of the animals here is questionable. I'm not sure what animal rights activists would say about being able to purchase raw chicken meat to be thrown at baby tigers. The containment of the animals made them look pretty miserable as well. I can't imagine how they can let an endangered Giant Panda be covered with dust, and lie in a concrete ditch with a little stream of water while biting on a plastic trash bag. It's absolutely appalling.Other animals seemed very unhappy in the oppressive heat. It also seemed to be a lot of facility for not that many large or dangerous animals.Anyway, I'd give this a miss. Go to to zoo back in your home country or city. At least the animals get better treatment."
Love this place,"Had an amazing time at this park. Fun safari type ride. Kids got to ride and feed elephants, pet Koalas. Saw great shows. Would go back in a heart beat."
Not worth,"This is not worth visiting, If you are planning to travel all the way from Hongkong. This will require a separate visa so it not worth"
"Great Zoo, perfect for family",I visited this zoo with my family and my kids love it so much. It tooks us almost whole day to enjoy the scenery and the animals. I would advise to take the cable car to have the whole view of the park before you decide where to have your thorough site visit.
So much fun,There were way too many animals in the safari. The safari ride was also unusually good. There were plenty of 4 d shows and other attractions too. I loved the pandas
Open zoo,"Be prepared to spend time here and enjoy the animals and parks. Lots of different animals to see and activities for kids. Staff are well trained and depending on season, this place is well known for the crowd. For us, it was perfect timing and weather."
Nice safari park,I like the train that take us to see many animal. The park is well organized. The toilet in the park is clean.
Awesome,The zoo is quite big and has feeding areas. Pretty large park and lots to see...one needs a whole day to have fun with your kids at this beautiful park..
Excellent one ,"Someone writes that it’s a waste of time; I’m really chocked!!!! It’s absolutely not ! It’s an excellent park but you need at least 6 hours, I spent half an hour enjoying pandas joking together It was a wonderful time"
Waste of tiime.,It's not worth a visit. You can utilize that time to visit pearl riverside or even different parks. .
Chimelong,The chimelong safari park is really amazing.... we had a great time there.. has a 5D movie...had cable cars... its worth a visit...
Nice place for a family visit.,Anywhere that has Pandas on show is a must-see for me and this property didn't disappoint. Spent most of the day here and took the Gondola ride over the park which was great. Food in the various restaurants didn't cater for anyone who isn't Chinese and the staff don't speak much English. So many gift shops with the same gifts was a bit boring and trying get a taxi back to our hotel at anything below highly-inflated prices was impossible. None of the dozen or so cabs on the rank would return us for anything less than double the fare to the site. This industry must be very lucrative here as they all preferred to stand around smoking and talking than take a legitimate fare. We took the train but be prepared to pay at lease double the legitimate fare if you take a cab back to your hotel.
Great layout,"The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! Don’t worry about getting tired while walking around this huge park, because you can always catch a ride on one of the many electric cars that drive around the park. We definitely recommend visiting this park if you come to Guangzhou!"
Very average,"I would not go so far as to say that it’s poor, but I did not enjoy it much. Kids in particular will gain something from seeing animals from all over Africa and Asia. That said, it is a real tourist trap. A dozen gift shops all sell the same schlock, such as pin-on tiger tails and panda keychains. I always wish that places like this would sell bird books, mounted butterfly specimens, and museum-quality posters of wildlife and some science kits for budding biologists. Alas, cutesy seems to sell.My first 4D-movie experience was fun, but a bit terrifying for little ones (I had to squeeze tight against my seat to let a family with a bawling four year-old make for the door).Great birdlife. You can see some wonderful flowers and the smelly giraffe pen is well-designed. Pay a bit and you can even feed one. The pandas are lovely, but if you really want to see pandas in China...go to Chengdu. This place prides itself on the miracle birth of panda triplets and these bamboo-munching former carnivores are always fun to observe."
Excellent park,"This is a lovely park to spend the day with family and friends. We went during the Lunar New Year and whilst the park was great our experience was not that great due to the long queues, lack of queue discipline, lack of English speaking staff etc. Nevertheless, we still managed to see most of the key attractions and enjoyed ourselves. Would return to this park."
Pros and Cons to animal welfare,"I was worried about visiting this park, knowing the reputation of Chinese zoos on animal welfare. I found it hard to find reviews that were realistic/impartial about this issue. So here is a review for you if you are also keen to see the good treatment of animals!  We visited on the actual day of Chinese New Year, hoping most people would be at home, not sure that quite worked out but the morning was quiet. Definitely recommend getting there for opening at 9.30!Good things..The park itself is clean, well designed and the staff are brilliant.Plenty of signs in english, good maps, clean toilets, reasonable food places.This is China, so inevitable crowds, but overall these are managed well. If I had to rate the exhibits, 90% are large, perfectly designed for thier occupants and with lots of enrichment. The animals look relaxed and well cared for. Genuine breeding for conservation seems to be going on.The pandas exhibit is brilliant.I live in China and predictably ridiculous random stuff was fun, like a weird anamatronic dinosaur walk through. ConcernsBig concerns for the white tigers, there were too many bunched together and the enclosure was small. Some looked a bit stressed.Similarly the Elephants and Giraffes were in small enclosures, though they didn't seem too distressed.It is a cultural lack of understanding but Chinese people bang on the exhibits and make lots of noise, can't be great for the animals. Many exhibits are a bit in the open, which is noisy and probably a bit disturbing. Rumours of mistreatment are in these reviews, I saw no evidence of this, but you never know.Overall this is a very good example of China improving its zoo reputation and I hope more places like this are opened instead of awful city zoos. It is clearly making efforts to present its animals in their natural environment instead of in circuses or performances. Overall a good day out !"
Wonderful,"This place is amazing. You can see white tigers ( baby tigers too) koala bears, panda bears. You can see everything from the air or go to train safari, between the giraffe."
MUST GO!,"Had a perfect day in there.For the hole day I forgot I was in China.The place is 100% clean, welcoming. Staff will help you always, you have panda triplets, baby lions and kangaroos and much more... what else do you need?! And price is ok for everything they offer."
Perfect zoo,"Worth visiting park, with big area. A lot of different animals from all over the world. Amazing panda area."
Fantastic park for children,"It's a nice park, with a lot of different kind of animals.You really can walk here for a full day!There is a lot of entertainment for the kids, the shows are nice!certainly will go again!"
Tiring and exciting in the same time,"I did not imagine myself getting so tired this much in my life. Going around the park is exciting but so exhausting at the same time. Overall, the safari is great. Kids will surely enjoy the place."
best zoo ever by a mile!,"The Jurassic park style tram ride was fantastic.  LOTs of exotic animals like lions, giraffes, cheetahs kangaroos, like over a dozen white tigers, tons of birds, monkeys, everything - plus two cable car tracks that circle the zoo and the ponds inside. I live in Chicago and we can't get a stinking elephant!"
if u ask which animal be cute?I believe every one know.,"yes, be this. every one like to watch them and  the place so peace and warm. if u hope come here ,u can tell me.may be i can help u."
A must visit with kids,We were in China with our large family and did an all day excursion to the safari park and the best we have ever been to.  You can ride the safari on wheel part and see probably 1/3 of the park.  The animals were well taken care of.  Th koala and panda parks are awesome.  They have lots of animals.  You can feed the giraffe.  Definitely recommend.
It is great,"This place was phenomenal! The animals were healthy and given ample room to play. I only visited for a few hours towards the end of the day but it is a very big safari park, and you can spend a full day visiting it. Worth a visit."
Renowned to be best Zoo in China - worth the visit!,"I'm always reluctant to visit zoos or in this case a safari park as i feel that it will be a letdown (from previous experiences). Well, Chimelong Safari Park was rare because i totally enjoyed the visit. The experience on wheels and also on the cable car was awesome (all included). My children enjoyed it and we plan to visit again! Getting there from Guangzhou was a little challenging with some taxi drivers not willing to take us and eventually, we had to get a taxi and pay what he requested instead of going by meter. The trip out of Chimelong was also tough as all the taxis waiting within the vicinity did not go by meter. Walking out to find a taxi may have been better if i did not have young children with me. Overall, it was still very worth the visit!"
"Trains, Pandas, Tigers","we enjoyed the Pandas, birds, giraffes, gondolas, train. so much to do at chimelong safari park, you can easily spend a full day"
Unbelievable panda experience!,"This was the most amazing zoo/safari park I have ever been to and eclipses all the great US parks including San Diego and St. Louis zoos.  Absolutely amazing.  The park is very clean, abundant food available although the big restaurant in the middle of the park is not English friendly regarding the menu - just follow the crowd and you'll figure it out.  Pandas were eating and romping around and just amazing.  You can also feed the giraffes which is a blast for the kids.  Other great exibits include the hippos, pelicans, tigers, monkeys.  They have a tiger cub pen where you can get up right next to them by the glass.  The park is very well laid out and has huge, wide paths and is generally flat."
Highly recommended!,"I could have stayed all day and then some!  The Safari was exceptionally clean and the exhibits were wonderful!  The tram and the gondola rides are included in the ticket price and give you a wonderful overview of the park, especially the gondola.  It was from here that we realized we had missed the monkey exhibits.  There was so much to see and you can get up close to most exhibits.  The triplet pandas were fascinating and funny- quite the characters!  Information is provided in English to at the exhibits, which really helps.   It was well worth the money to go.  Just plan on getting there early and plan for a full day there!"
Worth Visiting but Expensive,"Got my tickets from Klook with 10% promotion, weekday ticket is cheaper and lesser crowd. Tickets at the park cost 250rmb/person and if you bring your own car into the safari that's an additional 250rmb. I understand running a safari can be expensive but i find the entrance fee a bit pricey and along with most things in the safari.Redeemed tickets at Paradise Park counter then walk a little further to the Safari. No food allowed into the park, bags will be checked upon entry. They didn't confiscate our water so I supposed that is allowed. Safari is very spacious which is good which means more space for the animals (I hope). The animal exhibits are a little confusing because it's like here there everywhere and not exactly like the map.We didn't see any of the shows so can't comment on them. We took the cable car which was cool at first but then you realize you don't get to see much. It's an overview of the park but you can't really tell some of the animals that you are looking at but still nice to take a ride in it.I don't agree with some of the enclosure (leopards, pygmy hippos & pelicans in a small enclosure, etc). I also don't like the way they feed the animals. We had the ""luxury' to witness White Tiger feeding. Chicken meat are being dangled on a high pole to make the tiger climb the pole to get it; dangled in front of the pool so when the tiger jump to get the meat they fall into the pool and make a huge splash. Everyone went WOOOOWWW OHHHHH! Apparently it's entertaining for tourist (mostly China nationals) to see majestic beasts being toyed around like that for pictures. It's disgusting!How is it possible for 3 pygmy hippos & 3 giant pelicans to share one enclosure, there's just not enough space; also about 6-7 elephants in one enclosure. Leopards/big cats/elephants/etc don't have enough space to stretch their legs or run around.Feeding of animals are incredibly expensive (30rmb) each, we ended up didn't feed any. Since their park fee is already pricey to get in they could have included animal feeding/make feeding fee lower.Lots of different and interesting animals in the park. There is a free train that takes you around the safari unless you want to use your own vehicle then you pay for it to enter. We had lunch at Panda Restaurant, 20rmb for soup that taste like crap and about 70rmb for curry rice which also don't taste great. To think if we paid that much for food it will at least taste nice. Food here at average cost between 50-120rmb. I suggest that you get your tummies filled before you enter the park. Small kiosk sell sausages (12rmb ech) - not bad.It's super annoying after each exhibit you pass through a gift shop. Not kidding after every exhibit. It's like they think if you decide not to get something you will eventually decide to get it because you keep seeing it.Even though there are toilets everywhere in the park still Chinese parents allow their kid to pee in a bottle (have they not heard of a toilet? or they don't know how to use one or is it such a wonderful feeling carrying a bottle of pee around?)In Chimelong there is a ditch between the enclosure so you don't really get very close to the animals (not all). Overall I think the park is worth a visit but won't come back for a second time. I much prefer the Safari Park in Bangkok because there I feel like I get more animal interaction, it's not too pricey to feed the animals and I get to touch them (swans/giraffes/walrus/seal/yellowbirdy). It's an amazing feeling when you get to touch/feed one if you know what i mean.I left Bangkok Park feeling satisfied and happy (been here twice and still didn't get bored) but for Chimelong I left feeling different/not quite satisfied, can't really explain why - my personal opinion of course."
Highly recommended! More animals in one place than we have ever seen.,Take the ride portion of the zoo first to get an incredible view of the various animals. There is little separating you from the animals and there are a huge number of animals in each section. This zoo is worth the hype!
Worth Visiting,Be prepared for a lot of walking. Food pricey. Should provide free shutters for those who need to turn back. Free bus shutters but very pack and not enough instruction.
Highlight of our trip!,"Chimelong Safari Park is the best zoo/safari place that we have been so far, and we have been to plenty! Regular adult fare is 250 RMB while a child's fare is 175 RMB. But for some reason, we got a special fee of 500 RMB for 3 people (regardless of adult or child). Take note that Chimelong Safari Park has 2 entrances. If you are residing in the nearby Chimelong hotel, they will drop you off at the South Entrance. I suggest you do the Gondola first, and then the Safari tram ride. Upon entering the South entrance, you will need to walk about 5-10 minutes to the Gondola station. It opens at 10:30am i believe. And there's an Express Lane if you are a Chimelong Hotel guests. It can be useful especially during the peak season when there's a long lineup to use the Gondola. Anyway, there are 2 lines, one is going straight to the North Entrance, called the Swan Lake Line, and the other is the Circle Line, which basically goes in a loop and you're back to where you started. After taking the Gondola ride, you can go do the Safari tram (wheels) next. Try to stay on the RIGHT side as there are more animals to see there. The animals are amazing! There's not only 1 or 2 of them, but a whole family/herd of them together (ie. 8 lions, 6 rhinos, 40+ giraffes, etc.) The tram ride takes about 30-40 minutes and it takes you up close, especially to the herbivore animals. We also entered the Jurassic World, which was just alright for me. We were on a hunt for a decent restaurant for lunch, but it was a LONG LONG way from the Jurassic entrance. By the time we got to the restaurant, we were famished! We also found the food prices steep, but i guess what's normal for any theme/zoo park. We also went to see the pandas. There are 3 of them, triplets actually. They just sit there and munch on some bamboos. Nothing much going on in their pods. You can also feed some giraffes (RMB 30 for a tree branch!!, which was a ripoff) and also feed some elephants bananas. Overall, i'm amazed by this zoo. It's huge and lots of varieties of animals and you can see that they're all well-fed and relaxed in their habitats. Definitely a must-see with your kids when visiting Chimelong resort."
Go see pandas,"Went to the Safari Park and had a good time.  This place was recommended so we decided to go.  Once we were told we could see pandas, my interest was definitely peaked.  There are a lot of animals at this park and one should start off with the train ride.  We then saw the koalas and pandas.   Entrance fee was 250 CNY per adult which I thought was a bit steep but the place is still worth checking out."
Great park,This was a great zoo where the animals seems to be treated as well as they can in a zoo. The highlight of the park for our kids was the dinosaurie park which was really cool also for us adults. A nice way to spend the day and also to get close to the animals.
In depth!,"This is not only a safari park but also an animal sanctuary with a mission to preserve threatened species. We had the opportunity to see feline cubs and recent mothers in the delicate situation of only a couple of weeks after birth.The animals are active, well cared for and seemingly enjoying the activities they are offered. In fact, we met the baby hippos later on in the circus as well dome of the flamingoes. I supposed they need some variation in their daily routines as well as we the human beings do.This is a big park, take your time.There is a shuttle transport from the metro station and also a shuttle to take you from the safari park to the circus which should absolutely not be missed once you are in Guangzhou."
Safari Park,Simply amazed I have been to several Sue's but I've never been to a safari park I was amazed at every turn
very expensive,its quite expensive when i converted the amount to indian rupees . its quite big and also has a panda house
Love it,Nice safari park where visitors could get quite close to wild animals. The park was also very spacious with nice layouts. Plenty of clean toilets around  was a bonus especially for tourists. I loved the Chimelong Safari Park and our trip to China. This place was FANTASTIC!
One of the best zoos I've ever been to,"For someone who's visited practically every zoo and safari in the UK, and knowing the standards at places like Beijing Zoo and Badaling Safari (both of which are terrible, regardless if you care about animals or not,) I wasn't expecting much which is why initially we only went to Chimelong Paradise and the Water Park.However our expectations were blown away upon entering. Although it was busy, the staff were still extremely friendlier than they are at most attractions, something I've only seen at Chimelong so far. The attractions were all reasonably clean, had lots of information about each animal and the animals themselves seemed much livelier and active than any I'd ever seen in England. There were also quite a lot of them-in terms of tigers, there must have been around 50 of them, including white tigers and baby tigers too. This is a similar case for the amount of birds and monkeys, as well as having about twenty elephants, which is an incredible number. The monkeys and birds also seemed to be able to freely roam the park-whilst queuing for the sky ride (which only at most, takes about an hour. Sounds like a lot but this was during the summer holidays on a good day, so.) we noticed that there were gibbons just walking about on man-made pathways and ropes on the trees above. The birds too, seemed to casually fly across the lake, no net on top, and the vultures stared passively at us from their posts which we noticed they were not chained to. All in all, it seemed that the animals were technically free to leave but just choosing not to. We asked a zookeeper if they had clipped their wings so they could not fly away, but he said all they'd done was train them not to leave-if they had clipped their wings, how on earth were they flying across the lakes then?I definitely recommend the sky ride. It's free, takes you across to places you can't see on the ground and has amazing vistas of the lakes and mountains. The train is also a good idea, as you go right up and close to the animals in the safari section of the park for free-a giraffe even at one point poked its head in through the car!The zoo also has amazing facilities. The restaurant was much better than expected, although pricey, and the gift shops sold some actually decent merchandise, including very well crafted soft toys and rather useful ponchos as it started to pour about halfway through the day due to a tropical storm. We stayed from the minute it opened to just before it closed, and still felt like we hadn't seen it all. What an incredible place! Chimelong has everything a zoo should have, without losing its interactive and human touch."
"This is a ""Must -See"" It has Pandas !","We are ""kiwis"" from New Zealand - one of the reasons we came to Guangzhou was the chance to see Pandas -they are so cute ! We stayed at Shifu Holiday Inn, the taxi to Chimelong was 27km and took almost 1 hour - cost was 85 CNY which for 4 people is only approx NZ$5.00 each. There were several types of tickets available, and very little information in English, so took a while to sort out what to do. The Zoo is basically in 2 parts - the ""Safari on Wheels"" section which takes you past the bears, elephants, tigers, lions etc - you cannot walk this section. The second part is ""Safari on Foot"" where you see Swans, monkeys, Pandas etc. So it is essential that you do both ""Safaris"" as they are completely different parts of the Zoo with different animals. We bought tickets for 300 CNY which gave us entrance to both sections. If you are a ""local"" you can take your own car around the ""Safari On Wheels"", but for tourists like us, the Entrance fee lets you get on the free ""Train"" which departs every 10 minutes approx and takes you past the various animals - it stops quite close to the various Lions, Bears, Deer etc, usually for about 1 minute, so you need to have your Camera ready - we got heaps of really good photos.The Safari On Wheels part takes less than 1 hour. But the Safari On Foot section is huge - it takes 2  - 3 hours to check out the numerous displays  and the Pandas. There is a ""Jurassic Park"" section full of fake animated Dinosaurs that pop out from behind trees and roar at you - the are quite realistic - at the end you walk through a huge cave approx 4 meters high with some massive loud dinosaurs - bring a video camera - it's awesome. There is another cave full of snakes - some real and some fake - don't worry -the real ones are behind glass ! The highlight is definitely the Pandas - you get really close to them -you can almost touch them ! we have travelled to several countries and Chimelong is without doubt the best Zoo we have ever visited. It is a huge place, quite tiring walking around for 2 or 3 hours, but definitely worthwhile and an unforgettable experience."
Great place! ,"It doesn’t look like a normal zoo, it’s bigger and it seems that animals there are kept in good conditions. It is close to Hanxi Chanlong metro station, just 10 minutes walk or free shuttle bus, entrance fee is 250rmb, it includes a cable car and 4D theatre. You can easily spend the whole day wondering around, we were lucky and it wasn’t too crowded on the week day. Tigers, pandas, koalas, giraffes, elephants, monkeys, different birds- this list is not over yet. Great place to visit."
Best zoo in the world,Safari and circus performance were both amazing. We were both extremely impressed. Would definitely come back from the states and visit with kids! Must go to.
Very Good show but its very far.,"Before you decide to visits the place, be prepare to check the travel option. If you are traveling by taxi, it can be very expensive and time consuming. The best is to taxi the metro. Cant really remember the name of the station where you can take a shuttle bus to the park."
A great zoo to visit if you are in Guangzhou,A great place to be for different age group.  The safari park is a good eye opener with many exhibits.  Clean and huge park that can take you one whole day to visit.  There are safari cars to take you if you do not want to walk too much.  An activity which is suitable for all ages of the family.
Highlight was seeing Pandas!,"Caught the subway early and glad we did, as needed whole day here.  Most interactive zoo we have been to, really enjoyed the variety of monkeys freely swinging above us (watched by keepers).  Loved seeing school groups visiting also, they were very friendly and wanted to practice their English!  There is such a variety of animals here and the enclosures are big and full of greenery.  (Still feel it too small for elephants/giraffes etc but never going to be big enough for these animals... ) The Jurrasic Park is very well done, including life like robotic dinosaurs!  Plenty of water and food places round the park also.  This is a place for anyone, we had our young adult son and his wife, plus our teenage daughter and we all really enjoyed the day."
My no 1 attraction in Guanzhou,"What a fabulous park! Very green and treed. We took the cable car across the park and had a Birdseye view of the exhibits, up close and personal to the Pandas.The tiger breeding programme is very interesting and it was wonderful to see so many tigers of different ages. You can even feed them!"
been here often and recent,"not expected so close to the big city of guangzhou, half hour dirve from the city centre you easy find this park, which is part of a zoo, a crocodile farm and this safari park, where you take your own car or hop on a tourtrawler. a bit expensive, higher prices than in europe or usa"
Tiger Cub Heaven!,"Awesome zoo - beautiful landscaped grounds and enclosures . The highlights were the great chairlift - watch out for pandas! Also there is an endangered tiger breeding program here - so many gorgeous cubs of all sizes, and adults. A real joy!"
Lots of fun ,This place is awesome. Every animal I can think of and so many baby tigers and lions! Of course it’s still caged animals which sometimes isn’t pleasant to see but they appear to be very well cared for and there are so many. We did the safari ride and it’s pretty good but go when you don’t have to wait long or get a skip the line / fast pass.
Enjoyable day at the Safari Park; recommended,"We enjoyed a great day at the Safari park.  Took a metro from the airport to the stop where we got off at Exit E and took a bus to the park.  It is very BIG with a lot of trees and shade, which is great so you don't get sun-burned.  The safari itself was about 40 minutes in a train like car where we saw big animals including giraffes, elephants, tigers, zebras, kangaroos and also koalas, birds etc. There was also a cable car where we could see the animals from above.  There were also the rare white tigers and an area with pandas.  We were able to see the pandas playing.  There was a mini-mono-rail and also some rides in one area.  This included, for example, a log ride with water, a spinning pumpkin and a race-car etc.  The children enjoyed this as there were no ""scary rides"".  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking,  Although you pay quite a bit for the entrance fee (based on height - child or adult), everything is included in the fee."
You’ll be surprised,I would really say comparable to animal kingdom in Disneyworld. The place is HUGE almost twice the size of animal kingdom. It has everything from kangaroos to koalas and bears and pandas. It even has cable cars that takes you around the whole park. Definitely worth a visit when in Guangzhou. A bang for your buck 250rmb for each adult.
A good place for visiting with kids,"Visited the place twice during our stay in Guangzhou. Unfortunately, both times were during summer, making it really tiring. Animal enclosures are maintained quite well and if you plan right, you can catch a few shows as well. My daughter enjoyed it a lot."
Good for kids and adults.,"This is basically a Zou, but it focuses on safari and jungle animals. The Jurassic Trail can be frightening to young kids, but is still cool. It features anamatronic dinosaurs. The highlight of our visit was Panda Home Base where you get a great view of the Panda Bears.This is a great place and we intend on returning here on our next trip to china!!!"
If you're trying to fill free time definitely go,"Took a taxi from my hotel and unfortunately he brought me to Chimelong Paradise Park which is an amusement park for children cost of $250 rmb.  After I entered the park and realized it's not where I wanted to be I walked a short distance to the Safari Park.  Not many people speak English so you have to be adventurous to do this on your own without a tour.  Although, it's manageable if you are good with hand signals and directions.  Safari park was $300 rmb on a Saturday.  The park is great and a lot of animals to see.  If you're guiding yourself by the map realize that on the left is for you to drive or take a park shuttle versus to the right is you walk through the park.  The pandas are in a plexiglass enclosure so hard to get great pictures but they are so cute and fun to watch.   It cost me $55 rmb from my hotel and when I left the park the taxi driver charged me $120.  I paid it because there weren't a lot of taxis to choose from."
Nice zoo with a lot of incredible animals,"Chimelong zoo was a great experience. They have every animal you can think of and you easily spend a whole day there. Most of the animals have great space and are fine being held in capture, but the bears didn't seem to be fine. Especially one bear would wander back and forth in a small space and keep hitting a rock - it seemed to be physically unstable, and it was hard to watch. The elephants didn't have much space either, but they seemed to be doing fine. For eating: Most of the restaurants were closed, so unless you really love true Chinese food you should bring food on your own to be sure to have a good meal."
Beautiful zoo,"The park is huge, looks like a forest. The temperature inside the park is at least a couple of degrees cooler than outside, so it feels very pleasant (we were there late October) The animals look well taken care of and are quite active. We went right when the park opens (at 9:30 am) and found that the main adventure parts don't start until after 11 so we had a little time to kill after we had finished a large section but couldn't continue further. There are restaurants all around the park but not all have Western food, and not all are open all the time.The stop for the whole complex is Hanxi Changlong and there are maps inside the metro station showing exactly which exit leads where. We took Exit E and came out directly at the entrance to the Chimelong resort. There are free shuttle buses leading to the zoo, but you can also walk to the south entrance of the park (takes around 10-15 mins) and the way is clearly marked.All in all, a great experience, not just for children, and one could definitely spend the whole day there and have stuff to do and see."
Pandas!,"Big open aired nature park, some sections were closed of for some reason. Pandas were the big highlight of the trip! Definitely worth the effort."
Awesome,It's a huge park with all kind of animals. Just try it out by urself it rly worth it to go there. It feels like walking in the jungle
Perfect day,"I spent a whole day there, the quality of the facilities is surprising clean and the animals seem very well treated. And cherry on the cake, I got to see pandas!"
Great place maybe too many cars inside,"The Safari Park experience is something to do if you go to Guangzhou. The price is really reasonable for a gigantic place like this(300rmb) and during holiday season. You get in a train and go all around the zoo or at least a part of it. The only thing that surprised me and thought really unhealthy for the animals was that cars were also allowed to go on a safari-so if you have your own car you can go around this part of the zoo and get a close up of the animals. I would really add more trains rather than allow these cars.The rest was amazing: cute pandas, incredible tigers which you could feed and many other lovely animals!"
"Zoo/Safari Theme park, must go!","Is not a zoo, neither only a safari or a park, I would say is a combination of all of them into one single placeI would say is like a disney type park with animal themes that includes a safari rideDefinitely a must, kids will have lots of fun, specially with the pandas and tigersWe arrived around 14:00, entrance was flawless no crowds, but once inside, well, this is china so every body was there :)We attended on Feb 2nd, so crowd was high, lots of pushing on the pandas so taking good pics was a challenge, so I would recommend to avoid crowds by skipping holidays and weekends at all cost!All animals were awake and active, tigers and lions were not skinny so I assume they are well feed.Safari is nice although goes to fast, probably due to the crowd, I would imagine is best to go with your own car if possible.To get there, here are some tips:Take subway line 3, all the way to station Hanxi Changlong, then go to exit E, avoid exit A since there is nothing there (I mention it since their website says outside of exit A there is a bus, is not right).Once on exit E, you can either take the shuttle bus or walk, walking time is around 20 min, close but not so much. If with kids and stroller take the bus!Have fun"
Must see pandas.,"I had high expectations before visiting Chimelong Safari Park, and I wasn't disappointed. There's lots of animals to see in this huge safari park, where one can easily spend 6 hours. And the adorable panda triplets, is a must see, if you visit the park. I was there in September, and there was surprisingly little people. It wasn't crowded at all."
Must visit for Guangzhou,"A very focus and dedicated zoo with lots of rare white tigers, bears and impressive Panda family.  The panda triples are extremely adorable and close range within 3m without glass wall.Animals looks healthy, chubby and not stressed.  However, looks like the same set of animal testing during the day in their enclosure works in the circus too."
Part of GZ's # 1 Attraction!!!,"This is a huge, diverse, and most enjoyable amusement ""Park""!!  Most/many of the animals walk freely about this 300+ acre park- which is the largest in China!!.  The Panda's alone are worth the ""price of admission""!!  The other parts of this wonderful complex can be seen separately!!  It is well worth the excursion!!"
"Huge Park, Lots of great animal areas","We spent over 6 hours in this park, and still did not see everything, and only watched 1 show.  I wish we could have seen more and enjoyed more of the animal shows.  We started our tour of the park by doing the safari on wheels, we road in the train tram.  I found this part of the experience underwhelming.  If you end up sitting on the wrong side of the tram you miss most of the animals as almost all of the animals are on the right side of the tram.  Also preference is given to the automobiles who are also doing the tour, so the tram pulls off to the side furthest away from the animals.  You end up doing a lot head bobbing for a glimpse of the animals.  On the plus side, there are many animals, each area had numerous numbers of animals to watch.  Our families favorite was the Lion Pride sitting up on the mountain side as you drove by, they looked so at home on their perch.The rest of the park is with the admission and then some.  We took our time touring through the green dragon mountain, which starts with a pretty spectacular prehistoric tour (might be a little scary for younger kids, but they have warnings up for the scarier parts and an alternative route to skip over things like the t-rex cave, and the animated snake cave).  Animals were all plenty active, and well spaced.  Lots of variety, and all the animals seemed comfortable and well taken care of.The park was clean and tidy, plenty of gorgeous flowers and trees.  We kind of had to rush through the Panda Land, but probably would have enjoyed it had we had more time, but it was near closing time by the time we got there.I think if you really wanted to experience this park as a whole, it would take 2 full days.  We didn't have that time, but if they have a package for a 2 day pass with a hotel stay nearby, I would jump at the opportunity."
Great Zoo and you can spend 5 hours here,"Very big zoo! Grab the map at the entrance or you will find difficulty navigating around. Tickets can be bought on klook.com or simply go there to buy. I went on a Friday and it wasnt crowded. They have animal showcases on and off. Take the cable ride and the tram ride. Toilets here are surprisingly clean. Panda areas are air-conditioned, so that's nice. The staff are friendly and will help you with directions. Food and drinks are pricey.You can get your own car or a taxi to drive around the safari area (or simply take the tram). Queue for the 4d ride earlier.Very near the metro station and convenient to get to. Clean!"
very nice,"a very nice way to spend a day with the family, very clean a well organize, with well trained staffing, several show are interesting to see and it seems the animal are well treated.."
Interesting safari with wide RANGE of animals,"Thecrrivevtgru by tram is fantastic , well paced and well explained. Park is high and takes several hours to cover. Park management is good and service staff friendly and courteous."
Amazing,This place was great! I got to see all the animals and they have them very active when people are around so you don't miss them. The safari part is also amazing and last but not least THE PANDAS! 🐼 Overall 10/10
Definitely a whole day,"The safari at Chimelong Guangzhou is much better than any of the other zoos I have visited here. The animals do seem to be very well looked after, and much healthier than I had expected.There are some really interesting exhibits, and, thankfully, most of the information has been translated into English (which is obviously good for tourists). The tigers in particular are a joy to watch, and whilst their enclosure is not amazing, it is on par with Western zoos.The actual safari tour (you are driven around a much larger enclosure with a lot of different animals) is by far the worst part of the park, partially due to the fact that everyone was being very loud, but also due to the lack of proximity to the animals.But, for a day out, it is definitely something I'd recommend if you're with your family or significant other, as there is plenty to see!I do not know about the price, as this was part of a voucher with entry to the water park, and a night in the Chimelong Hotel."
Great experience,"Visited during summer,so clear skies and sunshine all around the vast amount of Animals was astonishing , unsurprisingly the que for the pandas were huge but the bus service in-site is excellent and a must"
So Normal ,All the animals were sleeping ... there are many animals but they're all so lazy I wanted to see an energetic panda but yeah haha that didn't happen! It's a good place anyways!
Magnificent experience!,"I visited Chinelong Safari Park with my parents during a 4 day stopover in Guangzhou. We found the zoo to be truly magnificent, full of wonderful encounters. We arrived prior to opening time and were their for 5 hours and still didn't see everything but had to leave because of our departing flight home. The animal habitats were amazing, much better than any zoo I've seen in Australia. The animals looked happy and visitors can come so close to interacting with them. Food options were fine; majority Asian and some Western but it varied between restaurants. We thought the prices were reasonable considering our experience but it may be pricey for families. Our bags were checked before entry but it consisted of a metal pile being stuck in the bag and my wallet moved. A quick glance really. The staff were very friendly but spoke differing levels of English. Still helpful when asking directions and pointing to the animals shown on the map. We couldn't find a park map in English so relied on signage but this was sufficient. The only frustration was taxis on departure. They were all off meter. We showed our driver the business card of our hotel and he said it was 150¥, 20¥ more than we were told. They won't negotiate either. We asked them to turn the meter on and he refused. If you can, organise a private car to collect, otherwise ask the taxi driver before getting in the car. A fantastic day, I would definitely go again."
Scary Experience,"This is the most unique zoo experience I have had. The cages are made of glass partitions and seem very scary. However, I am sure that they have done all tests to ensure safety."
All animal parks are just a bit sad.,"It wasn't by choice that we visited, I am sure that given choice, the animals would rather be back home. the locals seem intent on prodding, poking and otherwise annoying these often wretched creatures. The other parks on the site are well worth the visit."
Good but too expensive,Our kids had lots of fun here. The safari offers trolley rides through various parts of the Zoo and also provides cable car rides for visitors to view animals from the top. Everything is great except for the price. It cost RMB300 per adult and RMB210 for kids above 1.1m. I somehow find the entry fees are too steep for me to consider returning to this place again.
Wonderful ,"It's very big zoo and  safari is nice have a lot kind of animal , but have some problem about food , I didn't like any food in there."
Not so much for 'Big kids'!,"Expecting wide open countryside we (a group of 15 over 50's) were surprised to arrive at the park still in suburbia. It was very hot and humid but once inside the park there was a lot of tree shade along with fans and fine sprays of water to keep us comfortable. The non-railed train ride around the enclosures was OK if you were sitting on the far right - as most animals were able to be seen from this side. If seated in the centre or far left there were few photo opportunities hindered also by people standing to take photos. The commentary was only in Chinese, excessively loud and seemed never to take a breath. Chinese children shouting over the top made the noise level almost unbearable. Poor animals. The enclosures appeared to provide quite free movement but electric fencing was there almost out of sight.Once in the pedestrian part of the park there were caged animals and, like their enclosure counterparts, appeared bored stiff but it was extremely hot and very humid. There were shows in different areas, - feeding tigers, Asian Adventure, African Adventure, Elephant show (cancelled due to refurbishment of their arena). If I sound biased I understand the purpose of some zoos and the need to keep the animals occupied but, along with many in my group we do not like 'animal shows' and wonder about the type of training used. The general opinion from the group was that the whole set up was geared for children. The main attraction for us was the pandas. We viewed the world's only panda triplets. All lazing on massive blocks of ice. No sign of wanting to play today!Lots of walking; a few restaurants and cafes - some quieter than others. Loud, out of context music on every corner, clean toilets with a choice of squat or pedestal -HALLELUJAH !Much more commercial than say Australia Zoo and obviously geared to make as much money as possible."
Worth a visit,"A big zoo! Nice safari park where visitors could get quite close to wild animals. Even better if we were to rent a car and do a self-drive inside the safari section. With that perhaps we could spend more time and had more stops with nice pictures. The park was also very spacious with nice layouts. Plenty of clean toilets around. Free wifi facility everywhere was a bonus especially for tourists. Go for a visit if you dont mind about how they practise vast breeding of wild animals! If you could overcome this issue, then, this is one of the best Zoo/safari parks we have visited so far ( although we have not visited too many ! :) )"
Expensive but nice,"I went to Chimelong basically just to see the pandas and I was not disappointed. I only visited for a few hours towards the end of the day but it is a very big safari park, and you can spend a full day visiting it (and possibly not in a rainy day), however it's very ""touristy"", very loud at times and quite expensive. Worth a visit."
Absolutely AMAZING!!!,"I have travelled to many safari parks and zoos in the US and Canada. This place was phenomenal! The animals were healthy and given ample room to play. The variety, creativity and value was superior. The Jurassic World section was unbeatable! The kids could ride the rides for FREE. WHAT???? This would never happen in the US. I loved the Chimelong Safari Park and our trip to China. This place was FANTASTIC!"
Awesome! ,"Huge safari park. I did not imagine myself getting so tired this much in my life. Going around the park is exciting but so exhausting at the same time. Visit the place during cold weather. I also wonder why panda's, kaola's and tigers are all asleep during day time. U cant enjoy them. Too bad! I go all the way to China just to see them, but they are all sleeping. But overall, the safari is great. Kids will surely enjoy the place."
Make sure you phone to check whats actually at the park,"this was really disappointing in that half the animals were ""On Holiday"" yes thats what the staff told me once I had paid and started to walk around. No Pandas, No lions, No Tigers. All the said enclosures were being re-built which is a good thing but at least let people know before they go is please!!!! Also it was far to hot in June for the animals and the poor Wolf's looked like they were about to die of heat exhaustion. I left after just 1 hour."
An amazing park!,"We have been to Chimelong Resort Safari Park many times as a Guangzhou citizens. The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! That means no matter where you go, you will have lots of fun. Don’t worry about getting tired while walking around this huge park, because you can always catch a ride on one of the many electric cars that drive around the park. There are many fun activities to do. First, if you are brave, you can pet some tigers. Also, there are many animals you can feed with food provided by the staff. These activities cost extra of course. One thing to be aware of is, you cant bring food into the park. There is food available in the park. However, it is pretty expensive. It might be a good idea to eat a meal before going, to save money. We definitely recommend visiting this park if you come to Guangzhou!- Anna & Coco"
"Zoo great, safari ok",The zoo is quite big and has feeding areas so start early because kids love to stop at every feeding area. We could barely finish a part of the zoo. Safari was very ok.
"Ok, but not fantastic ","So we were expecting more from this zoo, being we had to pay $37 us per adult, but we're disappointed as many exhibits were closed or only had certain hours of operation. If you visit, enter thru north entrance and take the safari train, as for our family, it was the highlight. The pandas, of course, were adorable and their tiger exhibition was impressive."
wow ! absolutely thrilled,Tthis is one the best Safari parks i have visited in my life.There were way too many animals in the safari..The safari ride was also unusually good. There were plenty of 4 d shows and other attractions too.I loved the pandas . saw them in abundance..pretty large park and lots to see...one needs a whole day to have fun with your kids at this beautiful park..
good place,good place.we enjoyed so much this place.i can offer you this place and u can enjoy so much too .so go there
Amazing wildlife proximity ,I have never been to a zoo that allows you to be so close to wildlife without having you feel like you were attending a circus. This place gives you the experience that you are part of their natural habitat experience. Not animals performing tricks at a circus. There are many exhibits that allows you to purchase feed to feed the animals like the tigers and giraffes and many others. Make sure to start your day early and wear great walking shoes. We walked the whole day for 9 hours. Food and refreshments are sold there because food and drinks are not allowed into the park. You will get security checked for food prior to entering the park. Really enjoyable for everyone and all ages. But for sure extreme walking is required. The only negative feedback I have to give is there needs to be improvement in their English signing. Perhaps because I can only read English and not Chinese the signing was not all that clear to direct you to the areas you want to visit. The free ride through safari section was amazing. You see an incredible amount of different animals and you get pretty close to them too. Plus you get to see them interacting with each other. Amazing!
Best Experience,Loved this place!! Just caught a taxi from our hotel - didn't cost much. So much to see and had the best day! Not many (if any) food options for Western food but that didn't spoil our day. Will definitely come back here again. Make sure you see the spider monkeys! Just a tip in regards to the taxi stand outside the park - they are parked at a sign saying 'on-meter taxis' but refuse to put on the meter. Not sure if this is normal or we were just unlucky!
One of the nice place in city,"I was at my business trip in the city, i came to know about the place in the trip advisor itself they are many other places to visit in the city but i found dis one interesting one as the place will entertain most are children they will enjoy it lot and there is even meng meng station which is called ropeway charges are not included in the ticket of ropeway and  the ticket cost is 250 rmb per persob for the safari park and soutb gate is near to metro station, if you are in guanzhou visit the place once."
Decieving but good,"We had a great day in the end. Park is very decieving as to the ""Safari"" part. When inside you have to pay for the cable car, which was 80 yuan each for half an hour round trip but it was over the main part you walk around. Electric bus/cars you can pay to go on also. As far as a zoo goes it's better than Beijing zoo and most zoos we have visited. The animals seem content and not paising up and down like in most zoos and the have lost of room in the pens.tigers are encouraged to jump and climb for the food and elephants seen very contented."
The best zoo in China.,"By and large this was the best zoo I've been to in China. No small cages, animals have enclosures as well as you can drive your own car (or take the little train) through the park with giraffe and zebras poking their heads in your windows, a great whole day out. There is also a waterpark and circus attached to this place, you will need 3 days here."
Wonderful time,"The park is huge, we spent 6 hours and had to leave as all the attraction close at 5.30pm, even if the park closes at 6.30. At the entrance, check the hours of the shows. Start with the south entrance, dont miss the shows, go for the safari on wheels, the panda village, the koala village, it was awesome. So many animals, asian forest, africa savanna, birds, primates, dinosaurs... The show are all in chinese but still beautiful and entertaining.Food is expensive inside and you will not be allowed to bring in your food/snacks. Only drinks allowed. The park is very clean, with plenty of washroom. Lots of walking so plan your visit to see all the attractions. I was there on weekday, not crowded at all. Easily accessible from the metro, free shuttle to the park entrance. Worth the entrance fee."
"Fine, well laid out Countrypark","This is a very finely laid out country park with excellent facilities. Its worth every penny spent, especially if you take the package - staying in their hotel. We took the package for the country park, the hotel and the Circus there, and it was fantastic! One of the finest circuses we have seen anywhere, with great variety and fine performances. The hotel was excellent, with a Breakfast included (which had a very good spread, even for us -  who are Vegetarians) - though it was sad to see a lot of people waste a lot of food.The Park can be reached very easily by taking the Guangzhou Metro to the nearest Metro station where a Bus comes to pick up quite regularly. Even for going back, we waited for the Bus and took that to the Metro station (even though the waiting Taxis would all make you believe that the last bus has already left, and that the buses don't have a good frequency - just have patience and wait for the bus which go exactly as per the timings written on the Bus Stop.The highlight was seeing so many tigers (a very wide selection of species from very close quarters - some are just behind safe and very thick glass partitions) and lions. The Zoo Safari ride was also excellent - advisable to carry some drinking water with you on a hot day - as it is a long ride."
Nice little zoo,"We went to see the pandas but found out the exhibit was closed for long term renovations.  We enjoyed the zoo, although we were a bit distressed at the some of the small cages the animals were in.  A white lion playing an animated game of soccer with her food bowl was the nightlight of our day!"
Easter Trip to Chimelong Safari Park,"We all had fun, nice facility, easily accessible through train and free shuttle bus, well staffed and spread out pretty well and animals seemed well-treated. The safari on wheels can't be missed. Animal interactions, childres's park and other exhibits were fun. The aerial car was on maintenance that day, but we did not miss it too much as there was a lot to do overall. We felt the maps (handout received at entrance) could be improved and show times can be mentioned clearly on them. Signage along the park can be improved too. Animal feeding option was a bit overpriced for what it was, but we ended up doing it for the sake of our little one."
Highlight was seeing Pandas,"We enjoyed the safari tour ride around the park. It was pretty easy to nagivate the park, the paths were wide and it was very tidy.We loved seeing the Pandas (and even managed to Facetime our family back in NZ and show them the Pandas).Close to the train station (walking distance)."
Not bad at all,"Trip on a very busy weekend, as zoos go this is not too bad but still full of resident animals who have gone mad. Very large primate collections. Enclosures (the Ines that were not being refurbished) quite large. Place is very large, takes a full day to get around, longer if there's heavy crowds of marauding Chinese. Patience is a virtue here. We had a four year old, he thoroughly enjoyed the day, but was totally exhausted by the time we finished."
kids love it,"Must visit with kids, whole family and friends best if you can drive your car inside and photograph all animals from car window!"
Amazing experience ,"The zoo itself is very good maintained, animals look healthy, there is even a veterinarian clinic to show visitors the conditions of treatment. If you want to feed elephants or giraffes you need to buy them ""delicacy"" 50rmb/set. They also sell meat for white tigers and you can throw them pieces which is fun. Strongly recommend to try Safari on Wheels. The train will take you slowly around the area where you can see many animals while passing by. Beautiful place! We visited during public holidays and there were a lot of people, it didn't spoil our journey at all but if you have chance try to avoid public holidays and weekends."
Wonderful Park a Must See if you love Panda's,The Drive through Safari was great.  It was a very HOT day when we were there but all animals were out and able to be seen.  The grounds were well maintained.  Food at the cafeteria was just OK  Had difficult time finding a place to sit and eat as it was so crowded
Great place!,"Beautiful animals, pandas, birds, hipos, bears, lions etc. Very nice to visit, not only for children!"
Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park-The Paradise of Animal,"When you have a plan to visit this amazing safari park, spending a whole day for it will be good. I love the rare twin pandas so much in this park. I remember that I went there in a summer day and it was hot, the big fat panda slept on the ice, looking so lovely. You can buy a ticket online. A tip is that it is not allow to take food into the park. So, have your breakfast before starting visiting there. It is a little expensive to have lunch in the restaurants in the park.recognised as the leading zoological park throughout all of China, located in the biggest city in south China Guangzhou,  It holds a 5A class tourism attraction level, the highest level obtainable and is presently the only zoo in China to hold this ranking."
Worth a visit,"The park has been in operation for more than a decade and maintains an extremely popular place to visit.  This is one of the very few places you can see a panda family, the rare golden hair monkeys and the twin kuola bears up closed.  The self drive safari is a unique experience to take good photos of the 1000+ wild animals in the park."
Better then it was.,"It has been completely redone from my visit 3 years ago.  It is almost done with it's renovation.  I am not a fan of Zoo's, but it is at least nice now."
Great visit only a few concerns ,"really nice zoo/safari park. very interactive. I think the animals are well looked after and there are so many animals, I was amazed. The only concern I have are the shows. We went to see an elephant show and to be honest I wish I hadnt. The elephants performed tricks and painted. I have heard how zoos teach elephants to paint and it is very sad. I do not know if this was true of this zoo. But there was something off about the whole thing.To get the most of the day arrive early.We arrived about10 and we were there untill closure and STILL didnt get to see it all.A hightlight was being able to feed a  giraffe!"
So worth your time!,"Our main goal in going to Chimelong was to see the panda triplets but we were delightfully surprised with how wonderful the park was. It was expansive, with so many different animals. It was also very clean with many restrooms. This is a good day trip especially for families with young kids. I suggest you go on a weekday to avoid the crowds. Don't miss the Chimelong circus in the evening."
Have to visit just for the Pandas!,I'd never see a panda before and this was a highlight of my time in Guangzhou.  Not only did I love them but the locals go nuts for them.
Best safari ever.,"I spent an excellent moment there. So much to see and much walking too.Pandas, tigers, elephants, giraffes, koalas etc... all made my day. I could get a close look at them.Food outlets, gifts shops and toilets are available everywhere in the zoo. Helpful staff though some are not conversant in English.Free shuttles were made available to and from the zoo."
Great for all ages. You will have fun,Safari park was good with a variety of choices for the youngest and less young. Many wonderful animals which you can admire.  One of the highlights are the worldwide triplet pandas. They are so magnificent and playful that you spend your time looking st them. I would recommend to visit
Place to be once Panda pavilion gets ready,Animals kept with good care...your pet zoo is a wonderful place where younger kids can feed the animals and get loads if joy...Unfortunately Panda pavilion nit ready yet...once done that'd increase the excitement and fun in the zoo...
Love!,Had a great time. No miserable looking animals. Although the park people do get the animals to be active by teasing food. It was a good experience. Got to see the panda triplets!
Nice and big Park,Unfortunately when i went there is a raining day. But the Safari park is really huge. Price is a lil bit expensive but is worth it.
Reliably fun day out for all!,"Been several times with visiting friends and family, highly enjoyable day out with plenty of interesting animals to see, especially the white tigers, really quite beautiful. It's a big park so you definitely need a full day. Getting there is easy as you can take the metro and also taxi drivers will all know the place as well. Food is inside is generally okay if somewhat overpriced."
Great Experience for kids,"Lots to do but very large park so be prepared. We were there almost five hours snd did not see everything. Can bring in snacks and waters as well. Feed giraffes, see cool animals and ride the safari train."
City safari park with many animals and clean and safe environment,"It was a funny experience to get a safari park in the city, not in a very large area, but enough to have a good safe contact with wild animals, kids were very happy."
Simply a must visit for zoo lovers,"I love going to the zoo and this place is by far my favorite. The park is very very huge. There is a facility that works as a nursery for animals born in the park. This is very interesting place to visit baby animals. And there is another nursery in the tiger zone for tigers, lions, and wolfs. There are a lot of everything. You shouldn't miss this park. However, it might be a bit tricky with small children and senior people as there are a lot of hills and the park is huge. I spent a whole day there.The show has a lot of animals presented. There might not be any animal anti-cruelty act there as I saw the staffs hit and chased the animals aggressively in many exhibits. Or it might be their safety rules there. I'm not sure."
Must visit it.. ,This place is so amazing.. You can enjoy it with a lot of activities inside.. But need to go there early to have enough time to enjoying..
Adoption trip,"We are not big fans of zoo's and his place reminded us of why. They have many types of animals to see. It was very clean and well maintained. That is why they get a 2 rating. However, the enclosures were small and they animals seemed miserable. It was more sad than enjoyable.most of the animals were not in a captivity enclosure that would resemble their natural habitat."
Active animals,"Active pandas, prancing kolas, playful elephants, tame bears. Adjectives you will not usually associate with the different speciecs are found in Chimelong. The park has impressive achievements. It is home to over 160 white tigers, out of 300+ in the world. It is the first and perhaps only wildlife reserve to breed triplet pandas. The highlight of the wildlife park is the 3 animal shows and the feeding time. The animal appears on stage on cue, different species at the same time. The tigers and the bears were separated from the visitors only by glass (I hope it is thick enough) and during feeding time, food was dangled or thrown near the visitors so the animals would be pouncing towards the visitors. Do not confuse this with the Guangzhou zoo. Although the price is slightly pricey compared to the Guangzhou zoo and other wildlife, it is not everyday where you see animals so active.I took the metro to Hanxi Changlong Station and hopped onto a complimentary shuttle bus provided by the wildlife reserve which comes at a frequency of about 10 minutes. I was there from 10.30am to about 6pm, which is just sufficient for the main attractions. I went to the circus as well. While it was good, it wasn't as impressive as the wildlife reserve."
A nice place for the kids with an open safari ride,"This is one of the best private parks in Guangzhou...Panyu area which is well maintained , a huge park with a variety of birds, reptiles, herbivorous and carnivorous breeds. The park is spread across a huge area so one must definitely try to catch hold of the map to save time and ensure all areas are covered by the end of the day. The park has one of the largest white tiger populations & breeding programs(100 of them). The park also boasts of the giant Panda and the latest attraction of 2017'are the triplets. Please carry water / strollers / sunglasses/ caps for protection and convenience. Bring mosquito repellent, bugs seem to be a problem here.Getting to the park from the city roughly takes an hour , you can take Line 3 of the Guangzhou metro and alight at Hanxi Changlong. At the exit there will be shuttle buses that whisk you straight to the entrance of the park, or you can walk, it's about 10 minutes.There are shows such as tigers, elephants, chimpancees, birds, but beware it's all in Chinese.Since you're here do not miss the international circus which is in the evening, it's worth the wait, hey lots of mosquito repellent.Cheers and have fun."
Pandas and Koalas will make your day,"I visited the park along with my 2 friends and it turned out to be a great day watching so many animal species - Pandas, Koalas, Flamingos, Tigers, Bears are just to name a few. The ticket is a bit expensive (300 RMB) and on holidays the park is very crowded but the safari ride & an option to touch the snake species will make it up."
There is no vegetarian food!,"I went to the park today and enjoyed it. I am a vegetarian and I usually never go to these kinds of things, particularly in Asia but I read the reviews and all of them said the animals were well looked after etc. Well in my opinion, yes the animals do seem to be well looked after and the enclosures are bigger than what I have seen but no as big as they should be obviously, I was particularly unhappy with the wolves den it was too small. However If you do want to take a trip out here and you are a vegetarian be warned there is no vegetarian food in the entire park! The only thing you can eat is popcorn or ice cream, but I also don't eat dairy so that was unhelpful to me. You are not allowed to take your own food into the park. They check your bags and make you throw it out. So If you are coming for a full day- be prepared to be hungry or hide your food very well in the bottom of your bag."
A wonderful day of touring in Chimelong Park,"The chimelong safari park is quite big, need to be there early to take a full day finish the whole  park."
Amazing,"This place is absolutely an amazing place that everyone have to visit, you can find a tremendous amount of animal species from all around the world, they have maps to help you find where you want to go but you can go roaming randomly and you want get lost they have a great way of connecting the whole place."
Wonderful Park,"Had the chance to visit this huge park. I totally loved the beard, pandas, wolves, snakes among many other animals. This is an amazing place to go with or without children."
Exceeded my expectations,"This place is popular with families with young children. It is easily accessibly by subway and has free connecting buses from the subway station. The Chimelong (Chanlong) Safari Park is part of a development comprising Chimelong Paradise (a theme park) and Chimelong Circus. You can buy discounted tickets if you combine these attractions.The Safari Park is extensive and can be an entire day's outing. It is set in well landscaped grounds. There are various enclosures, some better designed than others but generally of a higher standard than what I had expected. In addition, there are regular shows on in various 'theaters' during the day that appears to promote a conservation message targeting a young audience. The animals appear generally well cared for. It is certainly not going to offend most people but the more extreme animal rights activists."
The most impressive Private zoo!,Spent a day here and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The Safari tour was impressive. The animal facilities were first class. Not to mention the Baby Panda Triplets.
Animals roam free,"Both the walking and the safari part are great, but if you only do one I would recommend doing the safari.  Its the closest you will get to the animals running free in the wild.  You can even get a chance to feed a baby tiger.... too cool"
Best park I ever seen.,"We saw Safari Parks in California, Africa, Europe and Australia. This one is the best and a must see in China."
Glorified zoo,"There are two parts in the zoo: walking or safari. They have separated tickets so make sure where you go, which gate. Expensive. There are some shows but elephants are making tricks and it's just sad. You can also feed some animals such as the elefants. The carekeeper threw his apples as hard as he could to the elephants faces. Dick. You can't bring your own food (or drinks) to the area and the food is really expensive and does look so good. Take your money somewhere else."
I enjoyed the Park!,Very big park with many types of animals. There were several of each breed of animal. Good walking paths. There were many rest points and food outlets and washroom facilities around the park which makes it very convenient. We enjoyed this park.
For animal lovers,Chimelong Safari Park is definitely the best  place to see n encounter with land animals in China.  Varieties said it all. Animals are in good condition.Must take the Sarafi train to have a wonderful animal encouter experience.
Bundle full of surprises,To start with we were not very enthusiastic about going to safari...  since I know lot of animals are sedated for the leisure of onlookers... but read some excellent review and thought to give it a try. It's certainly little pricey for attraction in China. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of it... Animals were not too badly iltreated. Off course for some shows and circus they were been trained and used which was sad part... but then overall we found it to be far far better than many other safaris. Safari on Wheels is must do... a joy ride in toy train to see the wild animals in midst of their natural surroundings.... we loved seeing Tigers and Girrafes... all in their natural form... with scary screams... all in all it was little bundle full of surprise and felt close to nature... :)
A most interesting way to spend Boxing Day.,"Went there on Boxing Day with the wife and our 4-year old daughter and spent 6 hours there.  This is by far the best zoo. The park is huge but very well laid out.  It is split between two parts- zoo on foot and safari on wheels. If you enter through the south gate you will start with the zoo on foot and work your way north to the safari.  Along the way you get to see animals arranged by their geographical origins and there are two or three theater type shows that you should try not to miss. What differentiates this zoo is that the animals can be viewed really closely, for example if you buy RMB 15 or 20 of feed (bundled leaves or long grass) you can feed the giraffe and the elephants, they will come within an arms length.The safari on wheels is also very interesting.  In contrast to other safaris, instead of having just one or two of each animal, they have herds- dozens of white tigers, lions.  There are herds of wildebeests, giraffes, zebras and other grasseaters grazing together in a large and open plain, makes you feel you are really in East Africa.There is a cable car under construction so that soon you'd be able to ""fly"" over the safari. Lastly the dinosaur zone is not to be missed, even if by then you are super tired.  You will feel like you are on the set of Jurassic Park."
incredible animals,I was blown away to see orangutans and baby monkeys. Watching the baby monkeys being fed was amazing. The safari park is huge so it feels empty! The pandas are amazing
Huge Safari park,Nice place to visit you need full day visit to finish looking they open from 8Am until 5 Pm you can use metro to reach the park and the way back the park provide buses near to metro station
Very well organised even with the crowds. Went to see the Pandas,"Firstly, I am not ordinarily a zoo person. We went to Chimelong Safari park specifically to see giant pandas knowing they they have a conservation program. They are also home to the only triplet born in captivity. We arrived early, but so it would appear did everyone else. Unlike some other attractions in China which are poorly managed (Terracotta Warriors in Xian) the crowd moved quite fast it it was well managed. Whilst you will not have to same Panda experience here that you will in Chengdu, this is still a great experience to see the giant Pandas."
Must see!,"This is full day adventure, that includes something like safari which is nice, if you have a car, but not really nice if you don't - the zoo vehicle doesn't stop near animals and you can barely see them. But don't be discouraged as walking part of the park is even better. And I don't even know, who will be more interested - children or adults.^_^ I really liked the area, where you can buy food for animals and feed them. Also Jurassic trail is a must see. And don't forget to check the time of the shows, some of them are really interesting."
Great show,"Beautiful cloth, good light and sound , great actors and actress. Fun and excite script . Highly recommend"
Nice Park,"This zoo has varieties of animals from white tigers to kangaroos to pandas. For the zoo (on foot), it's consider not very big. Some parts are under renovation. Since we have a limited of time, we was unable to visit the safari part. - they do not provide any hard copy maps and you will hv to download by scanning from their web at the park- some small 'show times' are only displayed inside the park which make us difficult to plan our time in the zoo- we arrived at 2:30. Park close at 6pm, last show is 5pm. However, we managed to see all the shows.All in all, if u love zoo. It's nice to pay a visit."
A severe moral dilemna,"Firstly, if you go here have a good breakfast. You cannot take food in the park and I have been slightly unwell for 2 days after eating some of the processed offering they have. Secondly, do you agree with zoos or not? Undoubtedly after China drove their national treasure to the brink of extinction they used these kinds of facilities to save and pay for them. However, they have gone way over the top. Too many animals with too small spaces. Add on that they train some of these animals to perform as if they are in a circus. But it serves the masses who I have found are generally uninformed about the greater world of flora and fauna. On balance this ""zoo"" left me quite disturbed."
Very nice zoo,We visited the Chimelong Safari Park during our trip to Guangzhou. Very easy to reach by subway and their free shuttle. The park is huge and there was lots to see. Pandas were cute and seem well fed. The safari  part is also interesting . We also enjoyed the Jurassic Park as well as  the show where African animals were introduced. Got to see the hippo close and out of water.
Trip to Chimelong Safari Park,"As the National Holiday is coming, I planned to travel to Chimelong Safari Park with my family during the vacation. We drove there by ourselves. It took about 1 hours to get there. In the park, there are a lot of tourists from different cities, as there are various types of wild animals and previous animals to see, especially for the children like my younger sister and my younger brother. It is quite exciting for them to meet the new natural friends. I think that it is also a good chance to broaden their horizons. What a fantastic experience it is ! I enjoy the visiting so much as I see many unusual animals, like polar bear, leopard and so on. However, I advise you guys not to feed the improper food which you may take from home. It is not safe or standard to feed them with the wrong food."
Circus show,"It was amazing the way of the show, preparation, actors, theatre and the place. Also the restaurants there providing good quality food with reasonable prizes."
Interesting zoo with great shows,"Went to the zoo on a saturday morning, was really busy so plan your trip in advancedWe watched the show which was well worth it, abundance of animals, not seen any show like this in any other zooBad points: if you take the safari on the train, the ride is really short, although you get to see the animals its from a far distance and further you have no control of the speed at which you see the animals, our train driver seemed to be eager to get back, we literally was at the Tiger and Lion site for less than 30 seconds before he moved on...Suggest if you can arranged your own car its much better"
AMAZING,"This is an awesome park! I have been to many parks and this one is so awesome. Tons of animals and the keepers have the animals so they come where you can see them-not hiding in back of the cage. You can feed giraffes, and elephants for a fee. The place is huge! We also did the part where you drive your car through. It was November and cool and the keepers were feeding so we got to to see all the animals. They have areas with very realistic mechanical dinosaurs and snakes. Well worth the trip. Not crowded on a Friday."
Would you let your kids be treated like these animals at school??,"I don't even know where to start.Within 5 minutes it was clear that the animals here are underfed, and not looked after by zookeepers that have the proper training. I would question if they had any training at all!!!The white tigers are starved and made to preform for food in front of crowds, you can tell they are starved when you see their rib and hip bones. How the park thinks this is any way for an animal to live is questionable.When we went on the safari on wheels... The lions were in an enclosure the size of a basket ball court, there would of been 12+ lions, all of them skinny enough you could see their ribs.Numerous monkeys had lice.Orang-utans and chimpanzees have been taught to preform tricks for food, and when they go to wonder off and play with their friends they are yelled at and abused by the zoo keepers.I'm not at all an animal rights kind of person but what I saw here was just wrong and painful.Hardly a life for an animal.Hardly a life for any living creature..Stay away!!!!"
Absolutely disgusted!!! Would never go back,"Of all the zoos we looked up before travelling to China, this one had the best reviews so we decided to check it out. We left disappointed!!!To start, the white tiger show. All three tigers were under fed, that skinny you could see their rib cages, they were taught to jump into the water to catch the food that the staff were hanging off a wire. The portions were hardly a snack.As we were walking through the monkey section, there was a little baby orangutang sitting on the fence, the zoo keeper was being horrible and kept smacking his hand when he went to grab a leaf off the tree or went to move from the pole he was sitting on. Every time he tried to look around or crawl anywhere he was told off, the zoo keeper then made a gun action with his hand and pushed it up against the babies head pretending to shoot it. I just missed out on getting a video of him doing this but I have a photo of him posted.The monkeys in another enclosure close by could not stop itching, it looked as if they might have been infested with lice.The 2 rabbits had no water bowl in their pen.On the safari bus tour the tiger enclosure was way too small for the amount of tigers they had (25), as well as the wolf and lion enclosures.To make things worse, the staff members appear that they are not trained or educated in the proper care of the animals.If you are thinking about going here, please reconsider.I would never go back."
Best Zoo / Park I've ever been to ,"Customers invited my sister and I to drive through an Animal Park in Guangzhou.  The idea really didn't hold much draw. I have been to several such parks around the US.  Only mildly interesting. But went to make my customer happy.  Very glad we went.  Started with a very entertaining drive through the park like setting.  Saw a lot of ""action"" amongst the animals.  It may have been just luck, but the staff was feeding most of the animals and not feeding them all at once.   So as we drove we saw each individual area of animals get fed.   The animals were running around and in a realistic setting.  Not at all like the usual parks / zoos where the animals are asleep in a smelly environment.  After the drive though the park we entered the zoo itself.  HUGE Zoo !   Great, natural animal settings and a good view of the animals.   Saw many animals I've never seen before.  Pandas, and some beautiful birds and monkeys.  Plus Koala Bears, white tigers, and more.  Again, the animals were very active. Love this place ! They have numerous concession stands for food and drink.  Had the Korean style chicken leg.  Tasted like southern fried chicken to me.  Delicious.  They also had iced coffee. Very much appreciated that. We went on a week day and it was not crowded at all."
Loved it,"A safari park or zoo? That's the question. In fact a little bit of both, a cross breed. Zoos always get bad reviews and far eastern zoos are portrayed worse than most, with animals in small cages. This is much better than that and all the animals we saw, were in spacious, natural environments. We went on a glorious sunny day in November and walked through the zoo section, enjoying especially the pandas and my own favourite the giraffes, before boarding a little tourist train to do an hours Safari on board.We don't normally spend a lot of time at attractions, but this kept us interested for a full day"
Wonderful Park,"The  wildlife park facilities inside is better, this let me feel very comfortable. South gate is the main gate of the zoo, here's a tip, it is better to go to the north by train, and then from the north gate has been playing to the south gate, because the animal show most concentrated in the south gate, at noon and it is time to start acting, and this arrangement is not turning back.First visit to chime-long wildlife park, this is really an international zoo, the animals of different countries are gathering here, a time to see so many different types and rare animals, but also saw the animal show, is really an eye-opener and full of surprises."
Once again came to the park,"This is a large wild zoo in guangzhou, when I was a child I have been there once, this is the second time I go, I think the zoo is the biggest characteristic can drive their cars or take a tour bus into the wild zoo, you can be in the car in close contact with the wild animals in the zoo. There are white tiger and golden hair, the wildlife park is very famous international circus, they make people nervous, exciting, it is worth a look. The zoo is very big, if you want to visit the zoo in all the places you need to spend too much time here. I recommend that you can be the place and family members or partners, the animals are cute, children will be very happy, this is interesting and romantic, but I don't recommend in very hot weather here, because it can let a person very uncomfortable and tired."
Great Park,Great Safari park to visit if you are in Guangzhou.  Have been on the tour a couple of times over the years.  Highly recommended.  Get in a train like vehicle pulled by a truck.  Get to drive through various terrains featuring numerous animals throughout the world.
Better than expected,A large safari with the option of driving into it with your own car or take one of the safari public buses or private rides. There's a huge area for walking around as well. Will need a full day at least if you plan to see everything. Go early.
Amazing ,"It is so big and nice place must see when you visit GZ , and better you start your day from 9 morning , because it will take almost 6 or 8 hours to see everything , but don't go at holidays because it will be full house , but it's really WAAAW"
do not worth a visit,"As a local in Guangzhou,I strongly advise you not going to Changlong. The tickets are really expensive and really not worthy to see just pandas, koalas and whitetigers."
"My favourite place in GZ, alongside with circus","Visited on a Thursday, in November. Brilliant weather, very few visitors. At some places, like panda triplets and tiger cub playpen, we were only customers for quite some time and it felt like a private zoo, especially for us :)Animals and birds are kept in good conditions. The park and animal habitats are very clean, no bad smells. Food was not great,  but above average, definitely. Safari on Wheels added more excitement. Jurassic Park was meh. The nature was amazing though.What really surprised us was how they started to pack almost all animals up in trucks and vans shortly before closing. Some were just taken somewhere on leash, walking on visitor pathways. The bears were taken out and the wolves were let in instead to the bear residence. We were like - hmm, whaaaat? O_OLater on we realized, that they were taken to the nearby circus show for the evening. And yes, almost all the safari park birds and animals made their appearance at the circus at night. And I'm not speaking about a few of them, I'm speaking about the most. Even giraffe."
The pandas are adorable!!,"The park is fairly expensive but kept immaculate. In addition the to the animals, the landscaping is beautiful. The park if very large and I was surprised how close you can get to the animals. The only draw back was that one path of the zoo has great animals so you don't notice how far you have walked, the return path is not as interesting and has less animals. So, you realize how far you have walked and it is not as much fun as the other path."
半天之旅,"12點去到,用了4個小時左右就走了. 看不了所有動物,但其實大部份最值得看的已經在搭火車上看了.  只係俾$15,我的兩歲小朋友能夠餵長頸鹿她很開心. 不准帶食物,我們是吃了才進去,只放了少量食物在手推車裡給bb.We used about 4 hours to tour around the zoo.  Didn't have time to go through each section, but the most worthy part would be the train ride where most animals of the park were present.  My 2 year old daughter was very happy that she can feed a giraffe close up for a small cost of RMB15.PS: No outside food in the park. Eat before you enter or be prepared to purchase expensive food in the park. For the babies, better feed them before you enter and sneak in a small amount of snacks and hide in the stroller as they only check the bags."
"Amazing safari style theme park, huge","Took the kid siblings (aged 7 and 9) here for a day, they loved it. Took us about 5 hours including a short lunch break to walk through all of it and take the train. Plenty of animals of all kinds. Food was pricey for China, and all junk food, so eat before or after."
Best zoo I've ever been too,Just spent the day here today. It's by far the best zoo I have been too. You can get up close to a number of animals. The park is huge we didn't do everything in one day. Will definitely go back.
The best zoo I have ever been...,"You have to plan to visit this magnificent place from early the morning up to the clossing time at the afternoon. Safari on weels at this beautifull mini train is a unique experience! Also quite interesting the jurassic park. The prices of food and souvenirs are quite expensive as usual in these places, but the ticket price for the zoo is in my opinion good."
Relaxing day out,Great day out after the madness of canton fair!Be sure to take the train to Hanxi Chonglong not Dashi as mentioned in the initial information
Amazing,"The safari park is not very far from the city and well connected by public transport. price of the ticket on weekend and holiday is high. The park is very big, took whole day to see the entire park on foot. amazing collection of animals and kept so well. do not miss the train ride to see the tiger lions and giraffe in open, this is really beyond expectation"
Amazingly afternoon,This place was only a short taxi ride from gneiss hotel and was great ... especially the pandas there...marketed heavily on Kong foo panda 3 though...great fun for all ages
Excellent Zoo,The Chimelong Zoo (Safari Park) is one of my favorites as it has a large variety of animals and birds and the place is well managed. The animals and birds are well looked after and the amenities are clean and tidy. It is better to go on a weekday and a non-holiday to avoid big crowds. The zoo (park) is huge and for a 6-hour visit I could go around mainly the central park area. I have been there several times and each time is an excitement. Food at the park restaurant is expensive. I like specially the pandas and the colourful parrots (located adjacent to the koala house).
Feel it's expensive ,"No doubt that it is very beautiful  but taking your own car inside is very expensive. Car they charge ¥300/- and per person also 300/- sitting in the car and 250/- for kids...... I felt too expensive   Walking is good, lots of healthy animals and many rare animals too in it. It was my 3rd visit, always love to go there."
Avoid the food at the park,"The park is fun,  especially with a good group of people. The animals looked a bit bummed from the heat and the cramped up space. On the brighter side,  the park was nice to stroll around in and the pandas and elephants were adorable! The mechanical dinosaurs that look straight out of Jurassic Park 3 were entertaining,  as well. Please stay away from the in-park food. I got immediately sick and spent a couple of days recovering. The buffet at the hotel was fine."
Must see place!,"This place is a must-go if you stay in Guangzhou! We were kind of hesitating specially after checking the entrance fee but we decided to go and I'm very happy we did. It is more crowded and ofcourse more expensive on weekends and also I don't know how its gonna be on summer because we were there in Mid October and it was like hot!  Also there is a great deal of outdoor walking. Make sure to wear something quite comfy, have full charge of camera or Cell phone and get prepared for the most exciting experience ever!The animals are so close to take picture with and the safari bus tour is beyond imagination! Do not miss this place specially if you have kids."
Very Enjoyable!,"This is not a super busy park.  Super pleasant and enjoyable.  Animals are all appear to be well taken care of and in great shapes.  Most of them are cage free, you can have very close encounter with most of the gentle animals like giraffe and certain breed of  monkeys,  very impressive.Prepare for some good deal of walking, once you are done walking and watching shows on half of the park, make sure to take the trolley safari tour, the last one was around 4:30pm, we almost missed it.  Best arrangement is to see the circus at the other park after the safari, you may get too tired, but its worth it."
More than expected,"Chimelong Safari Park is nice and interesting, Visitors can see the animal within a very close distance. Environment & toilet are clean which is difficult to find in China.It is above China's zoo standard. Zoo is big but some animal do not have sufficient space for them."
Avoid this place,"Worst hotel ever- tigers in small space surrounded by restaurants and glass. Stinky rooms,shark fin,sea cucumber, Took forever to get drinks and we were in a supposed VIP room. All the wine we tried to order ""no have"". The breakfast was terrible- cant put it on your room, have to prepay. First time I have experienced that. Apparently this is the best hotel in Panyu according to our local experts!"
Chimelong Safari is a MUST GO!,"I loveeeee going to zoos and seeing all the animals! I would high recommend Chimelong Safari Park! Surprisingly the zoo is well kept. The animals are pretty up close to visitors, therefore lots of picture opportunities with the animals. The park is big, you can probably spend an entire day at the zoo. My friend and I had so much fun seeing all the different animals. I would highly recommend anyone visiting to come to this place, especially if you are visiting with kids. I came with my friends, and we are in our late 20's,  and we though it was the bestest zoo we've ever gone to! =)"
Good one,Got to see the very rare giant panda.different species of animals and birds and the way they were presented for the visitors in the park was really interesting.the most interesting thing for me in the park was the landscaping. The way in which they have transformed 1000 acres of land to complete jungle was  really amazing.
