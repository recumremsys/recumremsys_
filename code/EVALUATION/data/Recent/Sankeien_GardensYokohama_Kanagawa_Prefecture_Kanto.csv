Serenity in Yokohama,"A beautiful and peaceful garden just south of Yokohama. A little bit off the beaten track, so not as busy as other attractions, but it's well worth a visit. Easy walks around the lake, with magnificent views of the villas and pagoda."
Don’t go during winter season,"Our cruise was cancelled due to Convid-19 . Trying to fill our time, we decided to venture this garden. Because of the season, there was hardly anything to see. I went up to the pagoda area (pagoda itself was closed) to get a glimpse of the garden from above. Quite barren, but I’m sure it would have been a pretty sight to see in spring, summer and fall.There was a house that one can enter (shoes off) and see how people live before. It was quite interesting.Took a bus from Chinatown area and walked probably 15 minutes to the garden . Bus was a flat 220 yen , entrance fee to garden was 700 yen."
always fun things here,we were lucky and saw a guitar concert live in one of the temples on the garden grounds...it's such a beautiful place and slightly off the beaten path in Yokohama. I imagine the fall foliage is also so pretty.
A garden break from the big city,"Tokyo certainly offers its share of beautiful gardens. Tourists know that. And Tokyo hosts a lot of tourists. The goal of serenity that underpins Japanese garden style can be achieved among a crush of visitors, possibly, if you close your eyes and play flute music through your earbuds.Or you can take a short rail trip south of Tokyo to Yokohama. Not exactly a suburb, but almost. A half-hour train ride from Shinjuku station and you’ve escaped to the largest industrial port in Japan. Not serene. But you won’t be stopping at the port. You’ll be seeking out Sankeien Garden.Yokohama also features the country’s greatest Chinatown, and you may want to have lunch there before catching the No. 8 or No. 148 bus to the garden $7/adult). Sankeien is so called because it was built by Hara Sankei, a rich silk merchant, and opened to the public in 1904. To add authentic touches Sankei-san pulled in vintage structures from elsewhere, such as the dominating pagoda, dating from the 1400s. Experience a tea ceremony, tour a gassho style (heavily thatched) house from Hida prefecture, or climb the hill to the pagoda. The garden brings together a little of traditional culture from around the Kanto region, a good introduction if you have no time to go very far beyond Tokyo. Because, presumably, getting to Sankeien is slightly challenging, it seems to remain more tranquil than the more famous Tokyo gardens. We stopped by in January, perhaps not everyone’s top month for garden visits, but it was only a bit chilly, the pine is always green, something is always blooming, and the waterfowl still frolic. Sankeien Garden is also a little melancholy. Its scars and ruins over a century call to mind the sad tragedy of Japan through war and natural catastrophe. Structures in the garden are gone or lie in ruins, victims of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 or, more poignantly, allied bombing during World War II. This faint reminder of Japan’s heritage, a small island nation prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and military dictatorships, perhaps can be sensed within the soft breeze through the pines and winter-blooming camellia. We can take time to pause and reflect. No earbuds necessary."
Serenity,"Beautiful, peaceful and well kept garden in the midst of a very busy city. Great tea ceremony. Worth the visit by train."
Great ,"Beautiful, great for sightseeing, walking, easy access with public transportation, highly recommended"
Nice Park,Not only the park is big and has a lot of different plants in it. Also you can see a lot of old house which were saved from beein scraped. This founders bought the house and brought them to this park. They preserve a part of the edo empire. You will understand more of japanese culture when you have see where it comes from.
Best Surprise of Yokohama,"This place is stunning, full of nature and such a peacefull place to go and make beutiful pictures! You can not miss that park at all!!!"
Interesting garden and buildings,Varied garden with 200 + 300 year old buildings moved from all over Japan. Lucky to be there for an exhibition of outstanding bonsai.
Well worth a visit,"Beautiful gardens in the Japanese style (obviously) with lovely, traditional buildings. Educational too; we learned that traditional rooms are measured in the number of mats it takes to cover the floor. It was wonderful to stroll around its peaceful grounds. We were a little too early for the autumn colours which would have been very special. I don’t know about other seasons, but I’d recommend wearing insect repellent in autumn; the water attracts mosquitoes. A must visit."
Place to go,"We have been at the right time in this place. The weather was great and its just beautiful and scenic splendor. Nothing to do activity wise, except climbing up to see 5 storey pakoda. But this the place for someone to spend time just walking around in a garden with all its calm and serenity presence. Plenty of spot to click pics and absolutely beautiful"
Beautiful place ,Great weather today so headed to here and was not disappointed! Beware you may get caught with a tour guide which is good but a little annoying as he was very passionate but also a little hard to understand! Mr Hara will feature heavily throughout 😊It's a very beautiful place and worth wandering around
Beautifully landscaped historical japanese garden,"Green plot purchased on early 1900's by a local merchant (Sankeien) to build his house and live there with his family. The garden was landscaped in the usual japanese style and along the years, Sankeien purchased, made dismantled and rebuild a number of religious buildings or tea houses from al over Japan, thus enriching the place until making it today one of the not to be missed spots in Yokohama. Even during his life, part of the garden was open to the public which denoted his communal sensitivity.A number of activities, including but not limited to classical Japanese music concerts are regularly scheduled in the grounds."
Serenity ,"Enjoyed our stroll around the gardens, bus trip was fine, good adventure! Lots of the huts/pagoda were closed off, not sure if due to recent stormy weather. Was hoping for some Autumnal colour but a bit too early for that. Awesome Japanese lunch by the lake, reasonable prices. Worth a visit if you like nature and have a morning or afternoon to spare whilst staying in Yokohama."
A garden one must visit   -serene  and beautiful,"Reaching  the garden :   On reaching Sakuragicho ( JR line ) station ,  went to bus stand no : 2  and could choose either bus route no: 8 or 148 . Bus fare JPY 220 ( one way ) and a 20~ 30 mins ride ( depending on traffic ) you reach the last bus stop  from where the garden entrance is a 5 ~7 mins walk .The garden :  After purchasing  a ticket ( JPY 700 /adult )  at the counter , the ticket is scanned at the entrance and then one can choose to either take a leisurely walk around the garden or go along with an English speaking guide ( free of charge ) . The landscaping of the garden with a big lake in the middle  is mesmerizing.  Since I visited during summer time , the garden was filled with  lush  green trees and small bridges leading to a few Japanese style houses which adds to the beauty of the place.  After a walk , just relaxing by the lake (which has ducks and  plenty of fishes), -  the tranquility will refresh you  immediately .A must visit place , while in  Yokohama"
HIghlight!,"We spent 2 1/2 wonderful hours strolling this beautiful Japanese landscape garden featuring walking paths among ponds, 17th century buildings, fine tea ceremony houses and a 500 year old pagoda.  The special bonsai azalea display was an unexpected bonus, but sadly we couldn't accept a free sample to take home to Australia.  We thoroughly enjoyed Yokohama, but this was the highlight for us."
A place of incredible beauty ,"Such a stunning , beautiful peaceful place to visit away from the hustle and bustle of Yokohama and Tokyo , highly recommended."
A Must Go When in Yokohama,There's always something beautiful about Japanese gardens and this is no exception. I'm glad I took the time to go to Sankeien Gardens. I was about to scratch it off my list when I lost my way from the bus stop. I wanted to stay longer but I had to go to Tokyo.  I entered from the south gate which seems to be less frequented by people. I went to the main gate and joined the free English speaking tour. It was wonderful! The lady tour guide were very informative about the place and its history.
Firefly festival ,Went during the firefly festival and saw tons of fireflies! Also we went a second time to participate in a tea ceremony and to see the bonsai trees. A very picturesque spot and a nice time each time I was there.
Well worth it,"I’m not sure what more can be said given there are already 1600 reviews. But here I am so clearly I am going to try. It’s a bit of a trial to get here as it’s not close to anything. From Chinatown it’s a 2000 yen taxi ride and a good 20 min drive. Once you get there and get inside the gate there is an impressive span or garden with a 3-story Pagoda overlooking everything. It was peaceful and quiet. Children were running and laughing. It was nice. Depending on the time of year you can see different varieties of trees and plants flowering. For us it was blue and pink hydrangeas. The architecture was beautiful. Some very old buildings from 1600s and some from Edo period. I really enjoyed the house that you could walk in and see how a family lived a century ago. A docent gave us a great walking tour of the house. It took us about 2.5 h to see everything but we could have stayed longer had the weather permitted. All in all, I would gladly do this again and would recommend it thoroughly."
Lovely gardens,"Had a really nice walk around here, lots of plants and different buildings, large lake area with little bridges dotted around as well. Took us nearly two hours and there were a couple of areas where it was quite steep if you wanted to go to the viewing platform or pagoda, but very enjoyable."
Picture Perfect,"I went to take photos and it provided the most beautiful scenes of nature, architecture, and wildlife. Perfect for a group, couple, or solo trip! Strolling through the park is extremely peaceful, but also hot if you go in the middle of summer. Stop by the tea house to eat dango and drink matcha!"
Beautiful,"It's a bit hard to find considering we had to have the bus driver tell us when we reached the stop but was completely worth the effort. I went to the gardens with my almost 84-year-old stepmother. By the time we had walked up the hill to the gardens, she was exhausted. It was terrific to find free wheelchairs available at the entrance. It has gravel paths, which aren't the most conducive for wheelchairs, but the wheelchair was very helpful. The gardens were beautiful even if most of the plants weren't in bloom. We especially loved our tour of the farmer's house. It would have been great just to wander through on our own, but one of the men inside offered to show us around as a way to practice his English and to help us learn more. That alone was worth the cost of admission. Like the majority of Japan, the gardens were clean and signage was in English."
Beautiful Scenery,"When we go in the garden, it is touching by stunning mountain and greenery view.  There have many big trees with traditional Japanese garden style and old Japanese house. There is a big pond with many benches around to sit and relax. We follow the walking route until to the observatory deck and must say that it took a lots of energy because most of route have many deep stairs and have to climb up above. Anyway, if you are still strong then it is worth to have some exercise :)  Toilets around the park and all are clean.  The garden closed at 5 PM so beware that you have to check in before 4 PM."
Extraordinary place with beautiful plants and ancient buildings ,A must go place. Strongly recommended place with several old buildings of Japan. Lake with large fishes. Peaceful place for walking. Free English volunteers guides.
A classic Japanese garden with historic buildings.,"We spent most of the day wandering around this peaceful, classic Japanese garden - a perfect escape form the hustle and bustle of Yokohama.Easily accessible by either bus or taxi. Japanese ""cafe"" included in grounds and tea ceremony available in the main centre."
Lovely Japanese garden in the city,"From the first step through the entrance of the garden, you will be caught in its beauty and surreal landscape. Pine trees, bonsais, flowers and ponds with romantic bridges...not to be missed. During my visit, many couples have their wedding pictures taken here and you get to see them in full costume and makeup."
Cherries are a spring time highlight,These gardens are always busy but never seem over crowded and there is ample space to explore and appreciate the numerous historic dwellings throughout the site.  My favourite is the old farmhouse but there are plenty to delight and in season the cherries are a joy.
Highlight for SURE,"My wife's cousin took us to this garden.  It was on a very rainy day so there  were not many people there, so we loved all the more.  I wanted to be able to see old Japanese for home and such and this was the place.  We loved every step.  We had a English speaking guide and he was great.  We spent about 4 or 5 hours there and saw everything, I think.  It was great.  The ladies that did the tea ceremony were top notch.  Make sure you go to the pagoda, it is worth the hike up the hill."
Very nice gardens.,We visitied these gardens at the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  We purchased a Minato Burari pass for 500 yen and used it to take the bus from Chinatown to the gardens.  It was about a 15 minute ride non-stop - very easy and quick. The gardens are beautiful and easy to walk around and enjoy. The entrance fee is 700 yen.
Great morning stroll with fine weather ,"We reached around 10.00am spent 2 hours strolling the whole park. Explored one of the old buildings, got smoked out as they were burning wood in the place as old times. Saw a beautiful heron, lots of turtles and tortoises big huge carps and ducks. The green was beautiful now, grass, leaves everything you see is so green, the color of summer. Air was fresh and slowly more and more people came. Tried the matcha tea and sweets. Enjoyable garden with a touch of old Kyoto."
三渓園 San Kei En 〜To be a Japanese man😤😤😤〜,"Eng. followsドイツ人の友達に日本人でハマ住みで三渓園行ったことないてどゆこと？と詰められること数年。「普通の」w 日本人になる為に三渓園に行ってきますた。園内はかなり綺麗にメンテナンスされており池の水も綺麗で鯉も亀もよく見えました(白鷺も‼️)。つつじや藤の花もありましたがやはり小高い丘、いやあれは山っすねw の山頂にある三重塔がハイライトではないでshowか。他にも園内全部回るにはかなり急な山道を歩がなくてはならずヒールや革靴ではしんどい事この上ないであります。藁葺きの古民家に入る事も出来、あっという間に2時間半が経ってしまいました。シルバーのボランティアの方もハツラツとされていて英語でのガイドもナイスアンドスムースでした。San Kei En is one of the most famous and historic Japanese traditional garden. Carps, turtles, and three layered tower welcome you in peaceful atmosphere. There is not only flat garden road, but also steep mountain path. So you need to put on appropriate shoes. I do Not recommend to wear high-heels nor formal leather shoes.Furthermore, you walk around in the garden for more than two hours✌🏻Ticket fee is ¥700/each. For more detailed information, refer to official website(I’m not sure🤔) I hope your journey is a good one ☝🏻"
Take the number 8 or 148 bus to see these gardens.,"Well worth the time travelling out of the city to see. It must be even more spectacular in the Summer and even in the Fall. However, the Cherry Blossoms stole the landscape views..beautiful."
Beautiful.,The Garden and the temples are very beautiful. We enjoyed it. The admission ticket was quite cheap. Easy to reach by bus.
Large and well-maintained Japanese style garden and houses,"A large traditional garden with ponds, waterfalls and blossoming trees, and historical residential and tea houses. A good alternative to Kamakura if you are on a tight schedule.  Half an hour from the Chinatown area by bus. Make sure to check the timetable as frequency drops during daytime. There are English speaking volunteer guides.鎌倉まで行く時間の無い時にお勧めします。中華街からバスで30分ですが、日中は本数が少ないので予めご確認された方が良いかも知れません。"
Wonderfull place,the sankeien gardens is an iconic green peninsula in japans second biggest city Yokohama. we have been there during cherryblossom: a colourfull dream.
Beautiful and peaceful place,"We had a lovely time strolling through the gardens, admiring the trees and flowers, and learning the history of this home.We loved seeing the ladies in their kimonos having pictures made, and then we climbed up the hill to see the 3 tiered pagoda.  All wonderful!  The climb was short, but steep for a person with disabilities- but it was a beautiful sight!  Definitely worth the bus ride if you are staying in Yokohama, and the entrance fee was about ¥700 per person."
Tip for a nice day out in the Yokohama area,"Beautiful park outside Yokohama. You do need to take the bus (number 8) to get to the park, or take a taxi. There are no train or subway stations nearby. The park shows some old japanese buildings and a three story pagoda moved here from Kyoto. The walkways are all gravel so good shoes are to recommend. There are some ponds and small lakes ans well as some small brooks. Very nice on good days. Dont forget to bring a picknick basket."
Beautiful Park in Yokohama don’t miss it!,Sankeien is probably the most beautiful park I have visited in Japan. Perfectly kept as you would expect with a myriad of interesting buildings brought in from different areas of Japan over the years. A few quaint restaurants offer a tasty lunch or snack as you walk around and then there’s the tea ceremony which is beautifully executed at the main building.Definitely worth a visit.
Beautiful garden,"A charming park located in a calm area outside of the city center. It's definitely a must visit, however be careful, the park isn't open from 29th-31th december."
"A must visit, when in Yokohama","This is one of the most beautiful Japanese gardens I have visited so far. It's so relaxing to walk around the gardens and you can easily spend 1-2 hours there and also sit down for a matcha tea and sweets or cherry blossom ice cream. Even though the location is a bit out of town, it's definitely worth jumping on a bus and visiting this garden when in Yokohama!"
Beautiful park,"This park is in a league of its own, so serene so beautiful and it practically brings you back to mother nature. 👍"
Lovely Japanese Garden,A lovely garden in all seasons. Great examples of period architecture and a lovely restaurant with great food on grounds. Something for all ages and tastes.
Lovely every season,"A fabulous place to enjoy Japanese heritage, buildings, and culture in a beautiful setting.  Pagodas, homes, temples, and buildings of national treasure are all in a situated in a natural beautiful setting.  I have gone during every season and always leave refreshed.  If no time for Kamakura or Kyoto, this is the place to go."
Very Nice Way to Spend a Few Hours On A DIY,"We decided to revisit the Sankien Gardens plan on Tuesday morning since we missed them on Sunday. The gardens don’t open until 0900 and five of us (Pam, Sue, Judy, CL and myself) jumped in one of those great Toyota Alfard taxis right from Osanbashi Terminal. About 2500 YEN later, yes, 2500 YEN for the 5 of us. We were at Sankien Gardens. (Note that the Princess 2 hour tour was $70 per person.) The taxi was not $100 as told by the destination lecturer. 700YEN per person entry fee into the gardens was a bargain. We spent 3 hours wandering the gardens and the exhibits having CL translate the Kanji for us just for fun – almost everything had English translations as well, but having him translate the characters directly was pretty cool. The gardens were not crowded at all, but did have several wedding picture parties. The formal wedding kimonos were incredibly colorful, detailed and beautiful. The brides radiant and beautiful. The koi in the pond were a lot of fun to feed and watch. All of us were cheering on the turtles trying to get a piece of bread before the swarming koi got it. Unfortunately they were not successful. The koi invariably got all the bread.Incredible pictures of an egret stalking and spearing an insect. Japanese and Chinese gardens, as explained by CL, are not botanical gardens exhibiting flowering plants. Rather they are islands of peace and serenity with everything strategically and deliberately placed to promote a unique view from every perspective. This was a private garden at one time and I can see how this would have been a unique and beautiful oasis for the family back in the day. There are refreshments (including beer) and toilets with the incredibly technologically advanced, AND CLEAN, stalls – including the electronic running water sound to encourage one to get the job done. All in all, a great and inexpensive way to spend a couple of hours in Yokohama."
Most Buildings are reserved for private ceremony,I went in October before cruise started in Yokohama. I was quite disappointed about most of the building are closed for only private use. The garden is well maintained but may be due  to season there was no flowers at all. I trust there are quite a lot of history to see if those buildings are open for public. Wish the garden can publish what buildings to open in their website to let visitors to decide if they should go.
Well worth a visit....,"Beautiful, tranquil oasis with lots to see...There are bridges, temples and houses.Spectacular collection of pines ...Wonderful ferns...Superb mature acers..Don’t be put off by nay sayers who cannot appreciate the subtle beauty of the place....The autumn colours have yet to come but still very beautiful..Also fascinating to see the house interior in the middle of the garden... complete with open fire...Very easy and quick to get to on the train.. then taxi from the station to the garden....only limited refreshments on site..."
Not worth to visit,"Perhaps I went there in the wrong season. I was there in early Oct, there's no flowers at all and almost all the buildings are kept for private purpose. I felt like I wasted my time, 700 yen and worst of all got a lot of mosquito bites."
Amazing place,The day we visited it was raining but this did not effect the walk. We had a free guided tour from a local volunteer it was a really great experience
Beautiful gardens,We were there in autumn and it was still very lovely.  Peaceful and lots of water features with opportunities for great photos.  Easy to travel by bus to get there and brochures in English to give history and other information
Beautiful even out of season,"The gardens are worth visiting even when Summer is virtually over and Autumn hasn’t quite started. We visited on a dull, damp October day and they were still lovely. They are beautifully tended and also include some interesting old buildings which you can enter -without shoes, of course.The entrance fee is a reasonable 700 yen ( if I remember correctly) Few of the staff ( apart from a lovely lady who was cleaning at a small temple ) speak any English, but it’s amazing what can be communicated with smiles, pointing and the occasional Arigato ( thank you) ."
Beautiful Garden,It is a must see place In Yokohama. The Sankeiren garden is place of scenic beauty.  Different flowers bloom according to the season. It also has a three-story pagoda that was built around 550 yeas ago. It is worth to take a walk...
Go for a 1 hour free English guided tour! Very informative. ,The garden is extremely beautiful in itself but we were lucky to encounter the free English guided tour (there was an announcement about the tour or ask the staff at the main entrance about the free guided tour.)  The tour guide was very informative and provided us with insight why the garden was constructed and the Zen- Shinto infused landscape. He even imitated the process of the famous tea ceremony at the actual building where the owner of the compound did the ceremony 100 years ago. A free guided tour is well worth it. Go for it when there’s chance!!!
Felt very refreshed!,After a very busy few days of tours here there and everywhere it was good to chill out. Very peaceful walk at a slow pace to take in all the gardens and buildings.We stayed about 90 minutes but could have lingered longer.Tranquility at 100%
Amazing garden!,"Amazing, amazing garden! Please visit it if you are in Yokohama. So beautiful. So traditional! I loved it."
Beautiful park,Sankeien reminds me of the extensive temple gardens of Kyoto! A gorgeous corner of Yokohama which should definitely be visited.
Must see if in Yokohama,"This was the high part of our visit to Yokohama.  Lotus flowers were blooming but even if they were not this is a great place.  We stayed 3 hours.  They do a tea ceremony, have eating places and an air conditioned gift shop and museum.  Lots of old buildings relocated here from all over Japan.  Great view from 3 story pagoda."
Cherry Blossoms Abound!,This is a traditional & typical Japanese-style garden with ponds & streams that include rambling paths & foot bridges. The crown jewel is a three-storied Pagoda that sits high atop the hill overlooking the grounds that include over 300 cherry blossom trees.
A summary of Japan in one place,"Yokohama is a large, busy, noisy industrial city and port, but at Sankeien Garden all that disappears and you find yourself in this quiet, serene and relaxing park with a pond, rivers, gardens, lush vegetation and a network of walking paths, trails and benches that lead to tranquility and contemplation. A number of historic buildings from around Japan have been dismantled, transported to Sankeien Garden and rebuilt with exquisite attention to detail, so you would not be blamed for thinking you are in some other town and not Yokohama. There are several tea houses in the park and the Garden is easy to reach using public transportation."
One of My Favorite Places on Earth,"Only a few stops away from Yokohama station, this hundred year old philanthropic garden is absolutely worth a visit. It is 175,000 square meters of serene Japanese garden with a large fish pond, hundreds of different types of trees, and impressive historic Japanese cultural structures collected from around the country, including their iconic pagoda atop the central hill. There are two noodle huts, plenty of bathrooms, explorable houses, and beautiful pathways. Year-round events and flower exhibitions are a constant draw and prompted me to get an annual pass on my 3rd visit. It's simply a wonderful place to be and well worth the $7 admission.It can be a bit tricky to get there from the train station, but several different bus routes will get you there in short order."
There are so much to see,Every season Sankeien Gardens has so much to offer. I love spring. If you are coming to Yokohama this is one of the place you shouldn't miss. It is not center of town so take a good ride of bus from Yokohama Station till the end. Oriental gardening and also Spiring has beautiful Cherry bloosm and all that...
Relaxing weekend escape,"This place is like magic, it takes you back in time few hundred years in seconds where you start wondering who lived here and what they were doing at that time?; how did they pass there time? Were they happy? They had beautiful creations! Was it enough? Then you come back to the present and wonder about yourself; will you like to build something like this?The man who first build this garden for himself was he thinking one day he will leave such a beautiful legacy?"
Bucket List!  This is a beautiful garden with something for everyone!,"This is by far the best garden we visited on the entire trip.  Because of our love of oriental gardening, it has been on our Bucket List for years.  It was great to see one that was so well designed, planned, populated, and maintained.  It has wonderful plants, water features, historic architecture, beautiful vistas, changes in topography, viewing platforms, and serenity.  It was a pleasure to spend a few hours here--there are photo opportunities at every turn and stop.  I have included a few of my favorites.Just as an aside, all ""true"" Japanese Gardens do not feature a lot of blooming plants.  If you are looking a masses of color and annual plantings, do not make this trip!  The beauty of the garden is the simplicity and the structure.  There is a real elegance to it, but it is hard for many Americans to deal with it when compared to Western Gardens.  You really have to find pleasure in the tree selection and training--the shapes are magnificent.  The ponds tend to be very still (there are a few waterfalls and running ""rivers"" for you to enjoy for the sound, but not many).  Just go in there prepared to relax and enjoy the natural beauty that has taken years to create!There is an optional Tea Ceremony in one of the many buildings on the property.  It is a very nice one that you should consider.  There is also a decent gift shop at the entrance to the ceremony room. The garden is very popular for wedding photos!  There are a number of you g people in native dress having their pictures taken.  It is really a beautiful sight--lots of color.  For those of you wanting colorful plantings, this will more than make up for the lack of it in the garden!It is important to point out that there is a lot of walking to be done here!  We saw no one in the garden with walking aids of any kid.  The main paths are smooth, but all the interesting side paths will be challenging to anyone with mobility problems.Even if you are not an avid gardener, you should consider this if you have the time.  We took the bus from the closest stop to the cruise terminal.  The bus system (like so many things in Japan) is more than a bit confusing, but you can muscle through it.  On the way back, you can stop at the Chinatown--which will bring you back to earth quickly!The gardens (as well as the bus) will require Yen--no credit cards are accepted!"
"Very very traditional garden, worth visiting at any season","Very very traditional garden, worth visiting at any season. I have been there multiple times and enjoyed every moment."
Yokohama Has a Gem! ,We visited the Garden in Summer and the Gardens looked miraculous... We were greeted warmly by a bank of very keen and knowledgeable local volunteers who had been doing the job for 3yrs and were looking forward to doing it for the indefinite future.... We didn't have a chance to go to the Tea Ceremony.... But the place was immaculate.... 400 + yrs of History... Look forward to coming back....
Gardens,We took a taxi to the gardens from our hotel simply because it was time efficient. Love to visit the gardens again in Spring.
So serene ,The gardens cover 17 hectare with a large pond and a number of historical buildings that have been relocated. Popular for pre nuptial photos it’s also a haven for artists. You could spend a most restful few hours in the gardens and feel much better for doing so .
Beautiful even if no flowers are blooming,"Such a peaceful place to spend a couple hours, even if nothing is blooming (just a few hydrangeas and a lone day lily). It is not hard to get here: if you take the Nissan Gallery skywalk to Yokohama Station, you'll end up right at the YCAT bus terminal. Look for ""A Bus Line"" (red sign) and go to platform 2 and get in line. Wait for Bus 8 or 148 and have exact change ready (220 yen at this writing). Drop your coins in the box as you enter the front, and take a seat. The digital sign above the drive displays the next stop in English as well as Japanese, so when you see Sankei-en-Iriguchi stop about 35 minutes later, press the red button at your seat to indicate you intend to get off.From where you are dropped, head toward the Claire bakery (stop in for a sweet treat-the pastries and cookies are good!), and then follow the signs 300m to the entrance. Lots of nice photo-worthy spots (again, nothing was blooming when I visited). Clean bathrooms inside and outside the entrance next to the parking lot. I spent about 60 minutes or so wandering around and enjoyed the serenity.To return, just go back to the same bus stop and take the #8 or 148 bus back (again have exact coin change fare ready). You can get off anywhere along the line, so if you want to explore Chinatown, Motomachi or the Yamate Park western-style homes on the bluff, disembark before the Motomachi-Chukagai stop. Enjoy!"
Garden of Tranquil Delights,"It takes a longer commute but so much worth the trip.  Plan your wedding photos, or take your sweethearts or children or parents to this beautiful and quite large piece of heaven on earth.  If you get hungry, you can find a quaint but wonderful restaurant.  And there will always be strategically placed and well-kept toilets. We went last February 2017 (not in dropdown option) while it was winter but still the place is teaming with visitors and the cherry blossoms are all over.  With entrance fee of ¥500 if memory serves me right."
"A gem, worth a visit","Nestled away in Yokohama this little garden is a gem. The garden is beautiful and well kept, very aesthetically pleasing. It also has little historic temples and old houses which are interesting in themselves. There is one multi-storey house you can walk around, complete with a fire in the open range kitchen, which is an interesting view into life into old Japan.The tea ceremony was quite fun, with very friendly ladies explaining to us how we should do it and not being too distraught as we got it all wrong!If doing a day trip to Yokohama it makes a good first stop. To get there we got the Tokyu line (catch it from Shibuya) and if you get the right train you can stay on it as it turns into Minatomirai line, then get off at the last stop, Motomachi-Chukagai. If you exit there (I want to say exit no.2 but don't quote me on that) you can cross the road to the bus stop - you can either hop on the bus no.8 which I understand stops nearby the garden (although we did not do this), or if you time it right there was an hourly bus that services the gardens and goes straight there. When heading back take the bus that goes every hour and get off near China town, just in time for lunch - perfect!"
Perfectly manicured ,Wow a pleasant surprise here for all garden lovers Lots of local plants and trees and flowers Very well groomed Peaceful surroundsIt’s worth the visit Everyone can relate to a well kept presented clean no weeds garden
Beautiful garden,Beautiful Japanese garden.  A little bit off the beaten path and not to busy.  A nice place to relax and undwind
Beautiful gardens,"Not easy to get to. From the Train station, need to take a bus and another 15 min walk. But so worth it, gardens are beautifully kept. Lots of nook and corners to explore and see. Hot spot for bridal photography."
In search of Cherry Blossoms!,"On our recent trip to Japan, we grabbed the opportunity to visit the Sankeisn Gardens. Sadly, as the Blossoms had arrived early, we can only imagine how beautiful this area would have been during the very short Season. We did manage to find one lovely tree in its last days so had to content ourselves with that. The Gardens are beautifully laid out and like most tourist destinations in Japan, seniors do get a discount. Typical of the friendliness of the Japanese, we were greeted by a volunteer guide with quite good English who was only too happy to take us on a guided tour of the area, pointing out plants, etc and showing us through the amazing Samuri building which is some 700 years old. So well constructed!We reached the Gardens by bus and there is a short walk to the entrance but well worth it and definitely the spot for camera enthusiasts. Do visit if you get the chance!"
Beautiful gardens,Great gardens especially when the cherry blossom is in full bloom. This is a very popular spot for tourist buses so expect large crowds. It is easily reached by public bus from anywhere in Yokohama.Very popular spot for photographers with the lakes and trees making a nice backdrop for the buildings
Sankien Gardens,Take a step back in time...see the houses of the Samurai in a beautiful Park setting...one of the Highlites of a visit to Yokohama and vicinity!  Do not miss!   Papadave Toronto
Fantastic gardens,These gardens were a delight to walk through and in particular the water features with the amazing Koi Carp fish. The walking paths are well signed posted with no difficult steps etc. Public transport takes you close to the gardens but return journey is better done by taxi.
Excellent Japanese Garden especially during cherry blossoms period,"This garden is a must go visit during the cherry blossom period. Its landscaping is simply gorgeous. While the entrance fee is steep and a good 20-30min walk from the nearest JR station, it is absolutely worth your time and effort. While there were lots of locals and tourist, its design make sure you don’t feel that is is crowded. There are various seats in the ark that provides scenic view. Try to grab those seats and have a bento. It is definitely a highlight for our Japan trip."
awesome Japanese garden,"used to be a private garden of a rich merchant now public access (you pay the entrance but cheap), Zen beautiful garden where any photo will be frame-able.. a must seen in Yokohama.. a bit far away from the center accessible by bus"
Stunningly beautiful and historical gardens,These gardens are probably the prettiest that I've seen in Japan. This was especially so as we visited during Hanami and the cherry blossom was in bloom. A bit of a trek to get to though with regular buses numbers 8 and 148 from Yokohama station to Sankeien Iriguchi bus stop not so difficult that its unreachable. Garden entrance 5 minutes from Sankeien Iriguchi bust stop. Worth spending time in the inner garden and exploring the buildings that have been brought here and reconstructed on site. The buildings open later in the year and some are for hire for weddings etc
Great!,"Enjoyed Cherry Blossoms, tea, views and the history.Visited here during the Full cherry blossom days.It looked so great!Joined a volunteer tour in Japanese.Learned the history.Had a green tea and some sweets.Bitter and sweet 😊Had a great day"
The best Japanese garden in Yokohama,"The best Japanese garden in Yokohama, although that’s not really saying much when compared with the greats of Kyoto. Still, Sankeien is pleasant enough for a strolling garden, as long as visitors do not expect a “Zen Experience”."
Spectacular,"Gosh this garden is beautiful. The inner garden especially felt like a peaceful, private sanctuary. It's incredible to think this space used to be private property with people living here. It's the kind of place I would go again and again if I find myself in Yokohama."
Great way to spend an afternoon ,"Feel this is a must for somebody from the West/US.  The Sankei Memorial as part of the display assessable in English, you can use an app to download much of information.  The Inner Garden has buildings from over the last several centuries reconstructed so you get a nice feel for some of the architectural changes. The outer garden and pagoda are also great to see.  The main pond has lots of carp on it, quite entertaining to watch the kids feed them.  The plum blossoms were coming out now, I can only imagine this place in Autumn or later in Spring."
Perfect place to take kimono wedding pictures,"We decided to take our kimono wedding pictures in the Autumn because of the red leaves. When searching for the perfect place in Kanto area our photographer showed some pictures of this place during Autumn and we decided that would be the place! There were other couples taking wedding pictures as well, but we highly recommend! The red leaves in the Japanese garden made our wedding album perfect!Tip: we booked for dec/6 from 11-13. The daylight helped a lot!"
Peace and quiet in the heart of the Yokohama.,"A beautiful place to relax and retreat after a day in the posh, bustling city that is Yokohama. It is a large expanse of old houses, temples, and lush greenery. What we enjoyed the most is a visit to an old farmhouse where Samurai used to stay. The Yanohara Residence is made in gassho style and is about 300 years old. On the day of our visit, luckily, there was an older gentleman who spoke English and offered to tour us around the house (for free!). It was amazingly preserved and impressively kept in good order. Definitely worth a visit. Also, don't forget to try the Shinagawa Soba Sampler in the restaurant closest to the entrance. I couldn't remember the name as it was in Japanese, like most establishments. What a filling, delicious meal! All in all, one of the best gardens I've seen in Japan."
Nice gardens overall,Gardens are nice and large. Lots of historic buildings to view. We went at the end of the autumn leaves and it was still busy. The museum inside has some nice exhibits. The lake is large with lots of ducks and carp for kids to feed (50yen for the feed).
A lovely retreat from the city ,"We arrived in the late hours of a grey afternoon and enjoyed quite a lot our quick tour of what Sankeien Gardens has to offer.Formerly the private property of a wealthy merchant, it boasts a central pond where fish and ducks alike scramble and wrestle for food at the hands of visitors.A small hill overlooks the water, crowned by a shrine and the ruins of the old merchant house. The short tour is well worth the climb.Hugging close to the pond are flower shops and a tea house.A pleasant experience all over."

Another beautiful garden in Japan,We went to yokohama and visited this garden.. its beautiful garden with history story... they also provide coin locker so we can walk around the garden more comfortable... its worth to visit when you go to Yokohama
Step back in time,Tranquil gardens full of historic Japanese buildings recreated in their natural settings. A delightful stroll on a warm day
Best experience from my recent trip,"Going here is the best experience I had from my recent trip to Japan. The garden itself is serene with a lot of history in it. I appreciate very much that when you enter the garden, there are volunteer tour guides who are happy to walk you around the garden, telling the story of each location along the way.But the highlight for me is the Japanese tea ceremony in the memorial hall. For 500 yen, we were able to experience a tea ceremony with macha and sweets, and as a bonus they also thought us how to make traditional tea! It's the best 500 yen we've ever spent. I believe they only conduct those every 18th to 23rd of each month.I'll definitely go back here next time."
Beautiful gardens and historical buildings,We took a taxi from Yokohama for the short journey. Beautiful quiet gardens to walk round and explore. Lots of historical buildings have been relocated in this stunning setting. Beautiful lake which captures the reflections. Nice cafes serving fresh Japanese style food. Also you can attend a tea ceremony here. Lots of newlyweds getting their photos taken in traditional costumes. You could go into one building to see the traditional Japanese way of life In the past. We thoroughly enjoyed our day here. An escape from the busy cities.
A zen moment,"I went to this garden which was about a 35 minute bus ride + 5 minute walk from our hotel in MinatoMirai. I needed to find the soul of Yokohama and I think I found it here.September was not a good time for viewing blossoms, it is probably enchanting in the spring when the cherry trees and wisterias are in bloom or in the fall when the maple trees turn from red to gold. But still I was not disappointed when I visited in September.In this garden, you will find your zen moment if you wanted to, in the reflective pool with Koi swimming to the surface, the sighting of a heron perched on one foot or a wooden boat with ducks drying their wings.Or have a tea ceremony with Japanese women who explain to you their art.Or to watch a black butterfly move from one red lily to another in a dance.Or witness a Japanese couple shyly walking together for photos of their wedding mementos.But if none of these touch you, then go for the architecture- the pagodas and restored homes of an earlier period reflect the culture that is sorely lacking in metropolitan Yokohama.Expect to spend 3-4 hours here if you can forget about the time away from the busyness of life."
Beautiful garden,"Japanese Beauty is here. In my case, I attended the concert to celebrate Full moon festival which Koreans call 'Chusuk'. On the beautiful garden, I could enjoy the elegance of Japanese traditional music with the bright moon. I will never forget this experience. Moreover, you can learn and enjoy Japanese Tea and desserts with the ladies in Kimono only at 500 yen."
"Beautiful, calm and No English signs!","This is a very quit and calm area with very beautiful landscapes and very large fishes in the lake who are waiting for feeding by the tourists. One of the important point is that most part is closed after 5:00PM and you should visit there earlier. Anyhow if you understand Japanese Language and like Japaneses songs and performances, you may find one over there. Also if you like Japanese tea ceremony, a suboptimal one can be found there."
Good collection of traditional Japanese architecture,"I thought it was going to be a boring visit as I knew nothing about this place. So, I was quite surprised to find a good collection of Japanese traditional buildings and houses in a beautifully designed (and huge) Japanese traditional garden. Perhaps you may no longer need to go to different famous tourist places all over Japan after visiting this garden as it offers bits and pieces of different traditional architecture and sceneries at one time. It is amazing that an individual created this “collection” (with his enormous wealth!)."
Serene,"Sankeien garden is one of the most serene gardens in Japan, and Japan has a lot of them! It's around 30 mins from Yokohama station by bus, and the only thing you're going to see there, but it's well worth the trip. We arrived there in the afternoon when the heat of the days was gone and the tourists were also lesser in number. It hosts a number of historical buildings/ cottages preserved in pristine condition, and set amidsts lush green fields. forests and a lake. Most recommended."
Quiet and nice scenery,Great place with nice scenery. Highly recommended to people who wish to take a break from busy cities.
Tranquil and instructive,The story of the place says it all... Follow the gargling streams with Koy fish and friendly tortoise to the closed Pagoda before visiting the quaint little country restaurant and make sure to put on some mosquito-repellent spray.There is also a tea ceremony at the heart of the restaured historical site.Great half-day out.
Peaceful Place,"You do a ticket at the gate, enter the garden and what you feel is peace! I tranquil place only 4 kilometers away from the Yokohoma City. Only sound you will hear is the loud noise made by crickets. They provide free wifi though the range is not that wide. This place is a must visit in Autumn season though I visited in summer."
Historical and classical beauty ,"If you have time in Yokohama, I recommend you to visit Sankei Park. You need to take bus to get there but it is worth visiting. Imagine you have a rich Japanese friend and a chance to visit his/her big house with a big garden. I'm sure you will have a nice memorable day at any time."
Nature at its best,"Make sure you walk along these gardens and enjoy the peace and silence. You will occasionally meet bride and groom photographed in this environement. You can even enjoy a tea ceremony nearby,."
A hidden peaceful jewel,"I visited this garden in Autumn many times and also spring to enjoy Sakura bloom. It's absolutely magnificent, try to go early in the morning when the crowds haven't arrived yet. For photography lovers, this is the place to get a glimpse of ''Nihon no kokoro'' the Japanese soul/heart principle where nature expresses beauty, renewel and end all at once."
Wonderful Place off the Beaten Track,"This is one of those places we would not have found if we hadn't had our own private guide. It was a way out of the centre and up a few small streets from the nearest bus stop.The first thing you notice is a huge lake along one side is a forest walk and on the other lots of lotus flowers. They were all out in bloom the morning we were there, even our guide had never seen them this way before.There were several temples within this large Japanese Garden, some of which had been relocated from elsewhere.There was a tea room in the centre where we took a traditional tea ceremony for a little extra cost.We spent two hours just walking round and admiring the gardens. There were volunteers on hand to provide history and guidance if required."
 Nice views of Mt Fuji,"Great escape from shopping and bustling Yokohama.  This place is calm, quiet and offers great view of Mt Fuji from the observatory tower on clear days.Plan at least 1.5h to visit, but 2 hours is more reasonable if you want to walk around the entire park and go inside the pagodas."
Quaint and peaceful - perfect place for picnic ,"Sankei-en is a beautiful zen garden. You can sit there, have a nice picnic and watch the day pass by. Not accessible by public transport so one has to walk about 5-8mins to reach the destination. Better to go on a day when it is cooler so the experience will be better. There are many residence cats around and they are adorbs. Offer them some water and they eternally grateful."
Calm and peaceful tour,I visited early this month (July 2) where the lotus flowers have not yet blossomed (only a few buds). The garden are mostly green but I've seen pictures during spring and its majestic during Sakura (Cherry Blossoms) festivals. Nevertheless I enjoyed this visit very much and the highlight for me was the farmhouse museum where a friendly English guide help me understand history and culture. I do recommend this place if you are in Yokohama area.
Definitely worth a stroll,"We were a little late for the cherry blossoms but enjoyed it just the same.  Spent a couple of hours here walking along the paths, reading the informative boards that explained the origins of the buildings.  Lake was nice - complete with turtles.  The local guide at entrance will point you to the correct local bus which is a short walk away."
"Quite a nice gardens, but nothing special alas","Situated in Honmoko, Yokohama these gardens are an enjoyable stroll.  The 500¥ admission fee is very  little and is probably the correct value.  The Park itself could be better inregard to quality of the design and overall settings.   My point is that being in Japan I would except a tour de force or a showpiece garden and park, but what we have is Japanese Garden.  Towards the rear of the gardens the noise of a nearby motorway flyover ruins the ambeinace of that part of the gardens.  Incidently becareful using the google maps directions for public transport.  The stop it suggested was totally the wrong place, and had to walk.a.further 800meters"
Beautiful gardens,These gardens are located on a hilltop and offer spectacular views of the water front.  The flowers are incredibly abundant and well maintained.  There is a huge staircase taking you up or you can ride an elevator or escalator.One of the cutest things for us was watching the daycare groups playing in the park.  Groups were identifiable by the single colour of their little hats.
As good as it gets for Yokohama,"As an aficionado of Japanese gardens, Sankeien is rather a hodge-podge of garden styles, though pleasant enough if you find yourself in Yokohama. It has to be said, however, that nothing in Tokyo or Yokohama comes even close to the sublime examples found in Kyoto...."
Really nice garden,Perfect garden to visit to get some quit and peace in your mind. Very interesting old houses to see in nice and calm suroundings.Take bus no. 8 to get there. It is not walking distance from the city.
Tranquil,A lovely site and stark contrast from the hustle and bustle of yokohama. Worth an afternoon stroll and picnic.
Stroll in the park,"Nice garden with beautiful seceneries and the buildings are from Kyoto, so it does have an ancient feel. There's alot of tea houses to see and is gooid place to walk in the quiet mornings in spring when the air is cool."
Like little Kyoto in Yokohama,"This park was founded by a silk mogul who was a collector of historic buildings from 600A.D. to perhaps 1200A.D. A very large estate and garden that have been donated to the City of Yokohama where my family took a very pleasant and enjoyable hike. Fantastic place for photographers who wants to capture some of the best Japanese cultural treasures and landscaped garden. Some very interesting historical facts include visits by President Grant and the Kennedy's and other dignitaries who had lunch at the tea house that is still serving food to visitors. The collection of historical structures moved mostly from Kyoto including a residence of Tokugawa Shogunate, Toyotomi Shogunate, a few temples, and a tea house, etc. makes this park feel like a little Kyoto in Yokohama. My family also experienced a traditional tea ceremony at this park that was very interesting. A very nice place to spend a day."
Stunning Sakura.,"This place it is amazing to visit,you can reach from Yokohama city by train and by bus.It was a gem plenty of Sakura,lake and hills around.Must be seen and visited!!!!!!!!!!"
A quiet garden with few tourists,The garden is off the beaten path.  Take a bus from Yokohama as it is too far to walk.  The garden has several structures from the Edo period laid-out in a very pleasant design.  It reminded me of Kyoto gardens in many ways.  From the bus stop it is a reasonable walk through a residential area.  There are small restaurants in the garden park.  We visited at the tail-end of cherry blossom season.
Don't Miss This Garden Treasure,"This very large, pictureesque garden is over 100 years old.  We visited in early March, when it was cold and cloudy and before the the flowers begin to bloom in profusion - and we still thought it was great. I'd go back, but April-May would be a lot better.  A big attraction was the many historical buildings that had been moved to these gardens from other areas. The houses and other buildings represent some differing styles and 100-300 years old.We, a party of 4, took a taxi from our hotel in Chinatown (Rose Yokohama).  Taxis are a little expensive, but we saved a lot of time compared with taking public transport.  Spend at least 2-3 hours."
A beautiful experience that offers glimpses of Japan's fabled past,"The only drawback about Sankeien Gardens is the rather long walk from the nearest bus stop (you need to take a bus from the train station, Negishi on the Negishi Line). But the beauty and historical/cultural value of the gardens more than make up for the inconvenience. Here spread out on the sprawling grounds are authentic temple buildings and teahouses from different time periods of Japanese history that are set amidst lush greenery including sakura trees and a wide variety of flowering plants that burst into glorious bloom in spring. The buildings were brought here from as far as Kyoto and Kamakura by the wealthy silk merchant who owned and lived in the garden until his death, after which the property was given by his estate to the city of Yokohama. There are so many points of interest here that it would take you at least two hours to just stroll around the grounds. There is a cafe and a restaurant when you want some refreshments. Highly recommended."
A beautiful garden but with some limitations ,A beautiful garden but with difficult points to reach for those who use a wheelchair and baby strollers. Around the big lake and the restaurants it is possible to walk with the strollers and wheelchair.But there are places that we can not see because of the streets made of stones and / or stairs.Even so my daughters loved feeding the carp and it was a good walk in the early spring.
The Cherry Blossom Garden,"If you can brave the walk and drive to here, and don't mind paying the 500¥ ($5.00 in USD); you will love this place. Went and saw it with the family and it was beyond beautiful. The way the Blossoms line the pond and surrounding area will simply take your breath away. If you don't mind waiting for the nightfall, the entire pond, pagoda, and Cherry Blossoms are all lit up with lights."
Cherry blossom overload,"This park is simply amazing.  Filled with Sakura (Cherry Blossoms) and adoring locals capturing this special time of year.   It's peaceful, calm and a relaxing out-of-the-tourist trail way to enjoy beautiful Japanese surrounds.  Definitely worth a visit"
Gorgeous Gardens ,Really enjoyed wandering around the gardens. We were hoping to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom but sadly were a week too early. It was still very pretty and we got a lot of great photos.
So Beautiful,"You could spend the day strolling through the gardens or bring a book and sit on a bench to relax.  We came in spring so were a little early in the season, but it was still a delightful day."
Pagoda built in 735,"I recommend visiting this beautiful garden! Unfortunately, the Cherry Blossoms weren't in bloom yet, but the Pagoda made the trip 100% worth it!"
Afternoon stroll in Yokohama,"Beautiful garden with many old buildings from different parts of Japan, including a house from Shirakawa-go, where you can climb up into the roof."
Just Magnificent,"It is a bit far to reach, but you wouldn't want to leave once you're in there.  It's not a garden--it is paradise!  The area is vast, very ideal for nature and history buffs as well as for wedding photography.  There are shrines, pagodas, bridges, exhibits, snacks, even an elderly granny painting the scenic view.   It blew our minds how special Sankeien is!  You would love it!"
Great Walk.,This a beautiful place to visit. The walk around the gardens is very peaceful ( although can get very crowded with tourists) . It is acccessible by public transport ( bus ) and pay entrance fee at gate so no need to pay excessive tour fee. Another must do in Kyoto.
A Place of Peace,"A beautiful park, even in winter, peaceful and quiet. The little lake and the plants and benches invite you to relax and enjoy."
Don't miss it,"We took bus number 8 in front of Sakuragichō Station. Paid 220 yen for the fare and the ride took about half an hour. After getting off the bus stop, walked about 10 minutes and that's the entrance of the garden. The entrance is 500 yen and we spent almost 5 hours in it cause there's so much to see. Lots of old buildings and nature beauty. I saw some Japanese simply had the picnic inside the park. As for us, we found the 800yen noodle to be really tasteful."
Vast & tranquil garden,"Tranquil and serene setting with huge pond, flowers, birds...abundance of nature! A good idea is to visit during the blossoming period of your favorite flower."
Pittoresque and tranquil!,It worth a visit especially for people who want to enjoy first-hand traditional Japanese architecture and gardening. A tranquil place which will help you travel in a passed area. I am not sure if it would be ideal to visit with a bad weather because it is a heavily outdoor activity.
Stunningly beautiful! ,"Sankeien is a stunningly beautiful, traditionally landscaped Japanese garden with authentic Japanese buildings from different moments in time, each a beautiful snap-shot into Japanese history, framed by delicate trees, gentle hills and surrounding a tranquil lake. The traditional restaurant, serving Soba is also wonderful, if, like me you're a fan of traditional Japanese food. A fabulous place to spend a few hours and well worth the visit."
A must-see garden in Yokohama,The Sankeien Gardens is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Like most of Japanese gardens it is a very relaxing place. We went there around April last year and there was an azalea bonzai exhibit. There were a few couples having their (wedding?) pictorial. There were benches in the area so you can rest anytime you want.
"one place, but you can enjoy many of different places","Kyoto, Nara, or any other histrical romantic old city in Japan we would like to enjoy ?please visit this beautiful garden - any season you will be sure to enjoy beauty"
Words are not enough to describe  the beauty....,"Words are not enough to describe the beauty and expansiveness of this spectacular garden. As we visited just at the onset of Autumn 2015; we not only had the visual treat of lush green lawns, plants and trees but also the sight of few maple leaves turning bright yellow and red. The beautiful architectural design and history behind the numerous temples and resting places for kings and queens within the garden was also quite admirable. A garden, definitely, to explore :-)"
Typical Japanese garden,Very Good Japanese Garden in Yokohama city. it is quite big and neatly maintained. The pagoda is also a good attraction to visit. You can feed some food to fish in the pond. It's fun for young children. Overall very good family short trip. Highly recommend !
Best garden i have visited,This place is amazing.  My mother was able to borrow a wheel chair and we could push her 98% of the track.  The grounds are breathtaking.  Every turn is picture perfect.  They have moved important historical buildings and placed them within the park.  We had a tour of one of the buildings.   It was so beautiful.   Outside tgere is a cute cracker and tea shop.  This place is a must.
Walking through a beautiful park,"I took the train on the Negishi Line to Yamate station & walked south east (least a 45 min. walk) from there to the rear entrance of Sankeien Gardens.You can take a cab from the station as well.Upon entering the garden, there is a fee to enter.  Around $4 - $6.Fyi, the main entrance is at the north end of the park.  I entered from the botton end & worked my way up.It's a beautiful park to have a nice walk, with ponds, streams, & various shrines & buildings.  Even a sweet place to grabs some sweets.  There's even a small place around the corner from that & grab a nice bite to eat.  Service there was awesome, friendly, & the meal was great.If you're in the Yokohama area & you would like to check out a nice park to walk & relax, then this a place you should check out."
Exceptional garden & estate,Just returned from Tokyo and had the pleasure to visit Sankeien Gardens. We werejust about 2 weeks away from momiji (fall colors) and any time between now and mid December should be amazing. It takes easily 4 to 5 hours and if you like to take picturesand the colors are changing leave more time. Take a cab from the station and enjoy your day. This is the estate of a silk merchant and was started in 1887. This is on of my favorite places in the Tokyo area in 15 trips.
Beautiful garden,"Spring and autumn are best season to visit, any season you can relax with green garden. You can enjoy walking and drinking Japanese traditional tea. You have to go their by bus from Yokohama, but it is easy to find the way."
A little disappointed.,After reading some good reviews we were a little disappointed as the gardens seemed to lack attention /maintenance  and were overgrown in places. We visited in Autumn so there was little in bloom and this may be the reason.Travelled there by public bus which was no real problem after finding which bus to take and where to get off.
Nice little Japanese garden,"It is lovely, decent sized Japanese garden, clean, maintained, well displayed, easily approachable, nice little place to get feel of Japanese garden"
Nice man made garden ,"Nicely done with little bit of everything. Also has Japanese Tea ceremony section. I liked it as nice day picnic spot with bonsie , Temple, Lake, sort of Hill top etc."
Holy cow!  Now that's a garden!,"A must see in Yokohama for nature aficionados!  The garden is as relaxing as can be with many structures detailing some of Japan's finest architects.  The area can be reached by bus or taxi and an English brochure is available.  The garden presents also a variety of specimens to tickle your ""nature"" side.  Don't rush through the exhibits, take time to enjoy the place, the history, and the view."
Highlight of yokohama ,"These gardens are just stunning.  Beautifully set and kept,  with very old buildings scattered throughout."
Wabi Sabi of Japan,Take a walk through this Beautiful Traditional Japanese Garden.  You will surely have a peace of mind together.  In September they have fireflys night where you can just relax yourself.  There is a Chaya where you can have Dango (rice cakes).  You can enjoy during the day and at night (only special days) to enjoy the Yabi Sabi of Japan.
體驗當地文化的去處,"沿路可以感受到日本那種街道很寧靜的感覺，三溪園中保留許多古色古香的日本傳統合掌屋以及三重塔，很幸運的我們遇到了一位園內日本爺爺為我們介紹，據說他們正在推行國際導遊，希望能有更多的外國館光客能前往多多了解三溪園的美，真的很謝謝導遊爺爺辛苦的導覽，讓走這景點的我們不像其他觀光客只是拍拍照就離開，而是深入了解每一棟建築物背後的故事，假若有機會前去的人不妨可以問問服務台看有沒有導覽。Sankeien Garden is full of Japanese culture building,many Gassho house in there.If you want to know some kind of culture in Japan, this is very best choice for u .*Thanks the enthusiasm tourist guide in Sankeien Garden!"
Ancient Japan culture,"A must in Yokohama, an area more then a garden. Do not expect meditative buddist simplicity this is more history of a person who saved some pieces of 1700-1800 Japan style. Nice walk, can be hot and sweaty so take your time. Have water with you."
Our local garden,I live in a short distance to this park so I have an annual pass which is great value. and the garden is worth visiting almost every months.
Nice place for taking pictures in spring and autumn,"Great place for taking pictures especially when the flowers are in bloom and when the leaves are changing colors. But can be very crowded depending on the day of the week and weather. Also depending on the wind direction, it can smell bad from the large LNG refineries located right next to the park."
Japanese garden ,Beautiful Japanese garden. Not much in bloom when we visited. Old Japanese mansion with tatami floored rooms and paper doors. Tea ceremony available (extra) but much better elsewhere or even on YouTube. Only worth visiting if already in Yokohama.
"Check the event calendar before you visit, you may fall into special occasion as we did","The day we visit there had exposition of Azalea Bonsai and popular month of wedding.Bonsai is not any more new to overseas countries, but bonsai with Azalea is rare.Month of May is most beautiful season of Azalea in Japan, so one can see them often in the park or temple but Azalea in Bonsai is very special.  And month of June and October is popular season for Japanese wedding, so if you happen to visit San Kei En garden in these months, you may have luck to see wedding couple in Japanese kimono wedding gowns. Wedding gown couple can be seen by accident but flower season is up-dated in San Kei En garden’s web side, so check it out before you go. Also it is highly recommend to taste classical Japanese snack of miso-dengaku (warm conjac with sweet miso paste) and tokoroten (agar-agar in mixture of soy sauce and vinegar)at one of their cafes in the premises.  Because they are so common food at home meal, it is rare to find cafes to serve those in town.  It is easier to take a local bus from Yokohama station but highly recommend to ask the driver(they do understand some English) the right stop to get off as there is 2 bus stop to enter San kei en gardens, and one of them is far from main entrance."
famous for a reason,"This beautiful garden is wonderful in Winter and Summer, but is best in Autumn and Spring.  The space and ambience of this garden sets it apart from others.  Buildings from all over Japan have been painstakingly transported and reconstructed throughout the garden, providing visitors with an idea of the wide variety of architectural styles of Japan.  The museum has a tea shop where visitors can experience a Tea Ceremony, with and explanation, all for a very reasonable price.  A must-see for visitors to Yokohama"
One of the most easily accessible and beautiful Japanese gardens.,"Sankeien is a very traditional and typical Japanese-style garden designed and landscaped by Sankei Hara, a wealthy businessman.　He reconstructed buildings of historic importance from places such as Kyoto and Kamakura in this garden,which was opend to the public as ”Sankeien”in 1906.It is a really beautiful garden that shows various aspects of Japanese culture assembled in one place. Especially beautiful during the cherry blossom period at the end of March. But it is worth a visit any time of the year."
Serene Sankei-en,"From Yokohama StationTake bus number 8 or 125 from the station's east exit to Honmoku Sankeien-mae. Walk through the shopping street, about another 7-10 minutes depending on how fast you walk, to the garden. The street dead ends here; taxis are always waiting here.  It is 500yen admission.From Negishi StationTake the JR Negishi Line to Negishi Station. Take line number 54, 58, 99, 101 or 108 to Honmoku. Cross the street and walk to the convenience store, turn right and through the shopping street. Sankeien is another 7-10 minutes by foot. Alternatively, you can take Bus 91, 103, 97 to the back entrance of Sankeien and get off at Honmoku-Sankeien-Iriguchi (on foot, this is the closer entrance but, sometimes, it closes earlier than the main entrance). There is a lovely pond and small pagoda type structure at this entrance. The surrounding park (Honmoku Shimin Koen) also has a static display of a trolley that used to run in the city of Yokohama. Kids love to go on it.Default date seems to be Sept 2015 as the earliest. I was there in 2014, to this park."
"Serenity , Japanese style","Love Sankeien Gardens! Close to where we live in Yokohama, so been there many times with our visitors. The pond attract many ducks, herons in the winter. Young children love feeding fish , you can bring your own bread or buy from there. Many Japanese White-eye, Brown-eared Bulbul and Great Tit near the stream , Common Kingfisher is not uncommon.Can be crowded on weekends during spring and autumn also on public holidays. If you love nature photography, definitely bring your camera."
Beautiful ,A wonderful example of Japanese gardens especially during the cherry blossoms season. A short bus drive from minato mirái and yokohama. There is a nice temple you can go up to and also beautiful tea ceremony offered by kind lovely ladies.
Beautiful garden ,Nice and beautiful garden.this is the closest garden from Tokyo where you can get an insight on Japanese ancient building and structure.ticket cost 500 yen.
One of the similar Japanese gardens,"It takes 30 minutes by bus from Yokohama Station(east exit Bus terminal).Hara family became rich dealing raw silk and silk mill industry and built their own houses and also bought temples, houses originally located in a different places in Japan and brought them here in the early 20th century. As I visited in the afternoon so only one available flower in this season ,Lotus were closed. Maybe you need to find the best timing to enjoy this place. There were old houses similar tot hose at Ikuta Folk Museum and a pond similar to that in Yakushiike Park,Machida. There are  two or three noodle restaurants in the garden but all of them offer japanese soba noodle only."
Beautiful garden with historical buildings,"Sankeien is a beautiful garden with some historical buildings, tea houses, pagoda, and so on. These buildings were originally in other places, but they were later moved to Sankeien. So, it is like a theme park of traditional Japanese buildings. As my wife and I visited, cherry blossoms ware in full bloom. It is wonderful, if you can visit it in April. But any other seasons will be nice."
Beautiful Garden,"It takes about 1 hour travel by bus from Yokohama city center.  Sankeien is keeping some temples and houses in good conditions.  Most of them are not allowed to enter.  But you can still feel how wealthy the Sankei family was.Sankeien is very beautiful and comfortable.  There are different kinds of trees and flowers.  I believe it has different beauty in different seasons.  It is a good place for a long walk, for photo taking, sketching...etc."
Really amazing,"Although it's kinda hard to find by public transport (bus) it was well worth the trouble we went through to find it. The gardens were really beautiful and relaxing, and there is enough English around that we were able to learn about the structures around, too. The tea ceremony was really nice, and they even offered to let us try out making the tea which was really sweet of them. Definitely will go back if the occasion arises."
Best near Tokyo,"Charming garden. The highlights are (a) Just after you enter, the view across the lake to the pagoda and they have moored a rowing boat to complete the picture, and (b) The ""Inner Garden"" with picturesque bridge, tea houses and planting. When you see this within metres of a huge industrial port complex its survival is all the more amazing,"
Very nice place to visit,Relaxing and a beautiful area to visit.   When I visited there was also a tea ceremony.   In the garden you would not know you were this close to a busy city.  The old buildings provides a glimpse of living in old Japan.  I would recommend going.
Beautiful gardens !,"A very special place! Gorgeous and specious traditional gardens, full of history ! Walk around, have some tea with mochi, visit farmer's house and all the other structures.. Its not paved there, gravel, so flats for ladies are recommended. We saw turtles, birds, carps..A very zen place, you will see wedding ceremonies there , entrance fee about $5. We took a taxi from our hotel , less than $18 from Yamashita Park area, 10 min rude or, so depending on traffic. Must see in Yokohama."
Pretty And Tranquil,"Make sure you have plenty of time for this garden.  My husband and I spent 3 hours walking around, sitting by the lake, enjoying an ice-cream and later a beer.  There were a few wedding groups being photographed which added to the atmosphere.The best part of the garden is the inner section where it is more traditional and therefore prettier."
Any season,Great family photo opportunity. Live ther house structure in the far back. Take off your shoes and explore!
SHEIKIEN GARDENS,As seniors in many places in Japan one gets in free so remember to have some proof of I D  All gardens I visited were immaculately manicured and beautiful to bring the best in the surroundings If you are there could be wedding photos being taken in traditional JAPANESE kimonos ETCA visit to any garden is a must
Sankeien Gardens. Put this on your list to do.,"Sankeien Gardens are a must see if you like gardens, or even just a very pleasent walk through a tranquil and serene green place when you want a break from the city bustle.Only 20 minutes by taxi from Minato Mirai, the gardens are surrounding a large lake with easy walking paths and trails leading off them and take you up to old temples and shrines overlooking the lake.We stopped at a small tea house by the lake and had a great small meal of traditional Japanese dishes of noodles and vegetables, washed down with a seaweed tea and a cold beer."
Most recommended in autumn,Sankeien garden is one of the most beautiful and well kept garden I was able to visit in Japan. It is most beautiful during autumn and next is during spring for the sakura viewing but there are so many visitors during this time.
Holiday,I first visited the gardens in 1987 and it's still as good now as it was then. Getting there from Yokohama Station west exit is a bit of a pain. The bus gets really busy.
Magical place,"A serene garden with blossoming cherry trees, a beautiful tea house, statues, turtles, ducks, a pagoda ...so much to experience"
Combination of tropical forest and japanese garden close to the city,"The Garden was established by a silk-trader around 1900-20. Many small temples and Nice footpaths through forest and park-areas in 175,000 sqm Space. A viewpoint gives you a view of some of the modern Yokohama harbour."
One of the greatest Japanese gardens in the world,"It was my second visit to this gorgeous traditional Japanese garden filled with so many interesting buildings and traditional houses.  It is so beautifully maintained and still had a few Sakura (cherry blossoms) in bloom.  The volunteer staff was especially helpful and accommodating and very open to trying out their English on non Japanese speaking guests.  The vistas and grounds were breathtaking, a photographer's dream location.  We were lucky enough to see a wedding couple in formal kimono taking their  photos there and  a wonderful view of Mt. Fuji from the overlook after being unable to view Fuji-San from the second station the day before.  A must when visiting Yokohama."
Traditional Japanese Gardens,"You can see a traditional Japanese gardens with silence mood.Many couples wearing kimono take photos here, so you can take pictures of them or with them."
Fantastic Spring visit for kimono clad brides,This is a combination of house museum and garden.  Cherries around the lake are superb in Spring offering fabulous photograph opportunities and the place is popular with kimono clad brides though i understand many have flown in for the opportunity from overseas.  The results are very picturesque.  My favourite visit is the historic farmhouse at the far end of the site.  It captures much of the charm of Japanese domestic building of the past.
Wow wow wow,Absolutely fantastic beautiful in spring . We saw so many couples getting their wedding photos taken here and you can see why . 500 yen to get in . We took the number 8 bus there and back . We had lunch in the grounds there are rest rooms and a tea ceremony which you can do there. We bought some gifts as well
Very scenic!,"There is a pond, small rivers, flowers and wonderful scrolling tails that make you think you are in Kyoto rather than Yokohama."
Simply Amazing,Just a peaceful place with beautiful cherry blossums all around. Very well laid out historic site.  I initially went for 1 hour and stayed for 4 hours.
Cherry Blossom season,Wonderful day spent here. We went on a Saturday during cherry blossom season and it was very busy. Loved the street food stools at the entrance. Even as a vegetarian I managed to get BBQ soya sweetcorn and a gold leaved ice cream. Both delishous. Defiantly worth a trip. Xx
beautiful,"beautiful walks. cherry blossom season is  a must. You can also try macha tea and Japanese sweets at the indoor tea cafe. Gardens are well kept, and lots of wild birds to see."
Beautiful Japanese gardens worth a visit,"I was staying in Yokohama and visited these gardens on a spur of the moment thing and I'm so happy I did! With a beautiful large lake, little bridges, mini waterfalls and Japanese building and view point this was a lovely afternoon. It was so peaceful and I took so many photos as it was stunning. If you want to escape the city and see more traditional Japanese gardens these are definately the best ones, even some of the more popular gardens in Tokyo did not compare to this place. I found it very easy to get to, taking the 101 bus from Yokohama to Honmoku and then a short 3-5min walk to the entrance."
Large and Beautiful Garden,"After staying in Tokyo coming to this place was a surprise because of its huge size. The garden was bigger than I expected and could take hours trying to cover the entire grounds.When my family went, there was a pictorial going on for a wedding couple. There were many backdrops for them to chose from.Some of the sights we visited:The carp lakeThe ruins of a guest house for a monkThe observatory on top of the hill, overlooking the Yokohama BayAn old Japanese house of a village chiefA small cottage a small area used to serve sweets in the pastTiny waterfallNumerous small shrinesPagoda The grounds we covered only made up 60-70% of the entire estate. We had to end the trip early because of the July heat."
A nice gentlemen docent.......,"I'm in Japan, from California, and my son wants to take me around Yokohama to see the sights.  We went to the gardens one morning.  It was interesting to see the different buildings that had been moved to the gardens.  We took a nice long walk around the lake, which is the center point.  Got a guide, printed in English, which helped, along with signs, explain what everything was.  For me, the highlight was a docent, who took us through a farm house, built during the Edo Era, moved to the park in 1960.  He explained everything, in Japanese, to my son, who relaid it to me.  The docent seemed very pleased to show off his building, probably taking us into areas that were off limits to most.  I hope I came away with a little more understanding of the culture and life in early 19th century, agricultural Japan."
Beauty and calm,"Getting there is a bit of a pain by public transport, simple enough, just slightly painful.Train, then bus, then walk.The walk makes up for the previous two. As I casually strolled to the gardens I had time to appreciate suburban Japan, with the streets in perfect conditions and everyone seeming to try and outdo each other with backyard semi-bonsai trees. Very relaxed when I got there.Not very expensive, about 1000 Yen, I think (or less). And free to wander as much as I chose once inside the gate.Come at the right time (late March/early April, I was told) and the plum blossoms are spectacular. Confirm this because they truly are captivating.All the buildings and grounds are kept immaculate. I saw a couple of others taking photos there and most everyone was considerate of each other, standing out of the way and so on. A rare treat for sure.Everywhere I went I was held in thrall by the magic of the place, walking around in this grandiose feeling almost palatial garden compound.A guide I read suggested an hour and a half here as maximum time, I would suggest another hour on that if you truly want to relax and wander through slowly, appreciate the feeling and splendour that is here.I left feeling zen and completely at ease. Seeing all the cats wandering around didn't hurt either. All very relaxed and comfortable with strangers everywhere.Enjoy the views, breathe the air, have a cup of tea at the teahouse."
8 reasons to be the best place to visit in Yokohama,This place is surely the best place to visit1.Traditional Japanese garden2.Old Japanese architecture3.Good view from the top4.Wild birds such as grey heron5.Beautiful flowers6.Can taste japanese tea and sweets7.Chance to see Japanese wedding8.Chance to see tea ceremonyonly for 500 yen! Unbelievable.Must go.English or French brochure is available.
Relaxing gardens,Get the bus from Yokohama station to this lovely garden to see some Japanese style buildings from all over Japan. I found a free guide who spent a couple of hours with me walking round the park.
Gorgeous!,"Our main reason for coming here was the plum blossom viewing, but the garden is worth a visit in itself. What a beautiful place! It seems very popular with local older people, and you can see why- stunning buildings, lakes, and interesting museum and a cafe serving particularly good udon soup are only part of the attractions. Its definitely much more than just a garden- you'd need at least a morning to look round properly.Getting there is just a short bus ride and a short walk. Buses back to Yokohama come about every half hour."
Nice garden in middle of city,well maintained garden.silent place in middle of city. perfect outing for peace of mind.3 storey pagoda is awesome so as other buildings.kindly go during some event to have purpose of visiting. event dates can be located on garden's website.
Tranquil,"My first visit to a Japanese attraction. A beautiful ancient garden. Very well maintained.Peaceful, tranquil and all the nice adjectives that can be bestowed. A must for tourists. A gem of Yokohama."
Still beautiful even in snowless winter,"You need to buy the entry ticket at one of the machines nearby. It's a hassle given the all-Japanese characters on the machine, but the parking attendant was glad to help.It's still beautiful even with many leaf-less trees, you can imagine the beauty in a glorious spring. There are many spots that's suitable for great photos, some with the three-storied pagoda as part of the background. Climbing up the hill to the pagoda was a different story; it looked steep and the pagoda itself was not that stunning, so I decided to pass the opportunity.If you look at individual items (like the pagoda I mentioned above), Sankeien garden was not particularly interesting; they look old, even a bit ugly.However, as a whole, the garden was exquisite.There were some temporary tents that were probably used to sell things in the garden (the tents were empty when I was there, perhaps because it's late in the afternoon). Those tents were an eyesore, quite unfortunate for such a beautiful garden."
Gorgeous!,"Again, leave it to the Japanese to make something so beautiful and the care they put into it, is amazing.  Very relaxing to take a stroll if you have the time."
Best Sakura experience,"We loved our visit to the Sankeien Gardens during the cherry blossom season end March.  This place is a gem of YOKOHAMA, and is definitely worth the visit when you are in town. The gardens are well tended and different flowers bloom throughout the year.  Just as nice as the gardens in Kyoto!"
Beautiful year round,"I saw this garden in every season as I lived nearby.  It is lovely and you can see historic Japanese homes/buildings here.  Very lovely during cherry/plum blossom seasons, but also for autumn leaves.  Lots of little trails/bridges/hills/ponds for all ages to discover.  My children enjoyed looking for turtles in the ponds and feeding the fish and ducks.  We saw a few wedding couples having nice photos done here.  There is also a fire fly festival once a year.  A haven in otherwise very modern Yokohama."
Autumn colours ,Big area and takes a while to walk around. There are some interesting old buildings within the gardens. Walked around for about 3 hours. Tranquil area away from the hustle and bustle.
A beautiful oasis outside the city,"I loved my trip here. We came on a very warm day in January and it was definitely worth the bus trip. It's a haven outside the city, peaceful and relaxing. A must if visiting yokohama."
Very nice quiet gardens,"We had the pleasure of enjoying a ""magician"" when we went. All very well organized. Nice gardens with the sunny day we had we thoroughly enjoyed !"
Quite out of the way,"This garden is amazing as most people are saying but you need a good chunk of your time to visit, which warrants it's place on google street view. There are special exhibitions year-round so you never get bored of it! The spring night view is my fav."
Fantastic View,Fantastic view. Very impressive with the colorful leaves.Don't forget to bring your camera. Wear comfortable shoes as there will be a lot of walking. Fantastic place if you like to jog.
Gorgeous all lit up at night,"I was lucky enough to be here for a Japanese music concert at night, with all the buildings lit up and looking absolutely gorgeous. Amazingly beautiful for both the ears and the eyes."
Inspirational,"The Sankeien Gardens were established by Hara Sankei, a wealthy Yokohama businessman in the silk trade who was also a poet, art collector, and tea ceremony enthusiast. Sankei acquired the historic structures now located in the gardens and designed their settings. The gardens include a wide range of traditional architecture: farmhouse, daimyo's villa, temple, tea house, and more. Beyond experiencing those structures, the visitor will enjoy the gardens themselves and the birds and other animals that the trees and waterways attract. Spending some time strolling there can be a refreshing form of walking meditation."
One of the best places to view the chery blossoms in Yokohama,"Sankien Gardens is a great park to visit year around, but the chery blossom season is my favorite. Bear in mine it may be busy so plan to spend some extra time, it is well worth it."
Nice garden,Nice walk through the garden and Japanese heritage buildings. As with everything in Japan the gardens were clean and well taken care of. There were also fish and turtles in the garden's main pond. (April 2014)
Charming,"It's a sprawling garden with peaceful, tranquil atmosphere. It has several historic buildings, tea houses and pagoda. There are different exhibitions throughout the year. The entrance fee of JPY500/adult is worth it. Get a map at the entrance, and also a unique stamp with the garden's name on it. We also tried a cup of hot matcha tea at the tea house. It's interesting to learn about the proper way of drinking tea, which is explained in detail in the pamphlet provided."
Beautiful garden with lovely heritage homes,"If you can't visit Kyoto, I think a visit to Sankeien in the fall or the Cherry Blossom season would be perfect. It is a beautiful garden and for those interested in old architecture, it is just perfect as they have transported old homes from across the country and re-assembled them here. You can even enter one of them!"
It's like Kyoto in Yokohama,The garden wad absolutely beautiful!Every season has its own beauty. We went to a teahouse that served maccha and rhey even offered to teach us how to make it for free! It was a lovely experience I would not forget.
Peaceful and beautiful gardens,"This site was one of may amazing Japanese gardens that we visited during our trip to Japan.  When I think of Japan, I think of its wonderful gardens.  This site is well worth a stop."
Peaceful and Meditative,We visited the Yokohama on a day trip from Tokyo and decided to make the garden as our last stop. We took a bus that stopped near the gardens. It should be fairly easy via online access instructions and even google maps (although google maps can sometimes be less straightforward).We arrived there mid afternoon and it was slightly cloudy but the view was still amazing and so peaceful.  It didn't feel like we were in the middle of a city/suburb.A little shop outside the entrance sold bread to feed the fishes and ducks.  The tickets were automated but you need to pass by their entry gate and have your tickets stamped.  They had an English map which had a short history of the garden and buildings.  They closed the automated ticket booths right after we bought our tickets but we saw several groups come in after us so they might sell it near the gate as well.The inner garden is very pretty and everything is so well maintained.  Definitely one of the highlights on our trip after the husle and busle of Tokyo.
Open air museum,Really nice park! I have been here in november but it was still green and even some nice flowers could be found. The houses were really interesting. One of the larger houses could be visited and it was my first time on real tatami.
Beautiful and serene gardens,Visited these gardens on  a beautiful sunny afternoon. Flowers were blooming and the architecture of the home on the premises took you to a different era.
Beautiful and unique garden!,"We took the JR Line train to Yokohama station then a bus no.108 and get off at the 'Sankeien garden stop'. It was late afternoon and we had less than two hours left to browsing around, but it really worth it! The walking trails were superb. They took us up hills, down to the lake, along small rivers and over the bridges! This place has rich history of both human and natures that will fascinatingly inspire you. Not to miss taking lots photos of beautiful gardens, amazing heritage buildings and the over 100 years old tree! Wearing good pair of walking shoes is a must to truly enjoy this garden! For totally comfort you may also need to apply some mosquito repellants for the late afternoon tour, we didn't have any and had to suffer with some bites! We took the same bus back to Yokohama station, but before that we got off at the 'revival' Yokohama China town for some Chinese food/snacks tasting adventures which included the Yokohama Number One dumplings and the Giant Chinese bun!  There are plenty of nice restaurants, that you may want to try and enjoy your night here."
Can't wait for the autumn foliage!,"There is a sense of tranquility and peace in this garden. Despite many tour buses stopping by, it's still not too touristy! We went again today, in hoping to see some autumn leaves falling. But it's not there yet. We went to one of the japanese resto to have some soba and japanese sweets. Would recommend it to anyone doing a yokohama visit to drop by. There is even a shirigawa go hut that was brought from Gifu in the garden. Will definitely visit again."
Peaceful Japanese-style Garden,This garden is a prefect place to spend a several hours strolling in. There are many spots for great photo opportunities. There is an indoor building where the tea ceremony is demonstrated. We sat at a small tea house and enjoyed a hot cup of hot green tea and Moji cake.  There is also a traditional Japanese-style house with indoor wooden fire stove and other tradition Japanese rooms.Bringing a camera is a must!
"Tranquil, peaceful, and an entire delight","We were on a boat cruise and going to these gardens was a part of the day tour which we had booked.  Obviously, we didn't have much time (only about an hour) to ""do"" the gardens, but what we saw of it was entirely delightful.  There is a wonderful sense of tranquility that we entirely enjoyed.  When we return, this is a place where we will be spending some time."
Nice gardens and relaxing spot,"Nice gardens and lots of koi fish. You can buy breadsticks to feed them which a lot of children and adults enjoy. From the lookout tower, we saw Mt Fuji on a clear day. You can bring food or eat there( which I have not done.) they have special events like firefly viewing and harvest moon viewing. Lotus flowers and stray cats also."
A pain to get to but well worth it,"The closest train station is Yamate and then a 30-45 min walk unless you find a bus or taxi BUT it was one of my favourite things to see.  It had amazing gardens, ponds, bridges, and authentic buildings including an historically accurate Japanese farm house.  There was an ""genuine"" tea ceremony for 500 yen.  It is not the most intricate tea ceremony out there but for 500 yen it was a good experience and a price I could afford."
Serene & Peaceful,"It was top of list to visit Sankein garden in Yokohama, Japan. The entry fee is 500 yen. From Shauragicho station, u can take a bus to reach there. After getting down from the bus, u have to walk for 15 to 20 minutes to reach there. The place is so beautiful, calm and quiet! Scrolling down the entire park will take u 2 to 3 hours. But definitely its good to have time in your hand so that u can stop and sit back and relax. There are some houses which were not built here but were brought here from somewhere else. There are some Japanese restaurants selling food. Taste is good and the people selling are really friendly. While we were there, a wedding was taking place. So its also good to see the bride and grooms in traditional dress. All in all, I loved this place and would highly recommend anyone to visit it while in Yokohama."
An oasis in the city,"We visited the gardens as the focus of a tour arranged by our cruise company, Celebrity.The visit to the gardens, even though the day was hot and humid was an experience not to be missed.For any visitor to Yokohama a visit to the gardens is well worth the effort.  It shows the efforts of one man to preserve the feeling of Japan."
Must see!,"A very beautiful garden, and a tranquil lake makes you feel peaceful to be there, took lots of photos."
Wifi included!,"lovely grounds with landscaped hills and ponds. free wifi and clear signage.  love the buildings (villa, shrines) dotted around the area.  easy walk from the bus stop too.  would be even lovelier in spring or deep autumn.  worth the fare, and clean toilets that are free."
Superb feeling of old japan ,"This is one of the most beautiful places in the vicinity of modern Yokohama.Visited few days back and felt very happy.There are few guidelines which might be helpful - the inner garden closes by 3.30 pm. Please go early in morning or by noon.- outer garden is open till five and you can eat your own food there or you can eat at some really good Japanese restaurant inside sankein garden (don't expect a modern city style restaurant)- please don't carry heavy bags.- baby strollers are difficult to use inside inner park bcz of stairs and uneven terrain.- do carry a good camera lot of good pictures can be taken here.Overall it's a good day trip for few hours, quite relaxing and enjoyable."
This is Japanese Garden!! You can enjoy seeing the natures in city.,"いつ行っても日本的な景色に出あいます。You can find beautiful JAPANese scenery here. Maybe 2,3hours  walking around here gives you much more experience than you can have in cities. Including Tea celemony experiences..."
Nice park,"Bring a camera. This garden is home to houses, tea supply houses and a three story pagoda that have been transplanted from all over Japan and represent the many different styles from different Japanese periods of history.It was a nice stroll in the garden, so to speak.Many bodies of water filled with Koi fish and turtles. 500¥ entrance fee is quite good."
Tranquil place,"Very peaceful.  Loved watching kids and adults fishing for crayfish. Lots of water and bridges, very tranquil.  We caught a taxi from Yokohama central, cost 23000 ¥.  There were 3 of us, so this worked out well.  You can take bus or train, good directions on website, but taxi was quicker for us with limited time and on a rainy day.  Staff at front entrance very helpful."
Japanese architecture and gardens,"This park was big. Therefore, it holds many treasures. You can see many Japanese buildings built in the old style, and although most are forbidden to the public, the biggest one is open for exploration. This big building is the same type that you would find in Shirakawa-go, so if you don't have the time to go to Shirakawa, this is a good shortcut. Also, this park is often used for photoshoot for traditional japanese weddings, and so you can see the traditional kimonos used for the occasion. It's pretty cool, and adds to the atmosphere. There are a lot of cats there; they're cute.It's definitely worth a visit :)"
"Kyoto, Nara, or Kamakura, in medium-sized park form.","I took a couple of British visitor friends here in May, as they were staying in Tokyo, but had no time to visit a historic city such as Kamakura or Kawagoe. Perfect way to trip back in time, to pre-modern Japan, for half a day. Went there with my wife in early June too, to watch the fireflies."
Very well kept gardens,Beautiful gardens. A real escape from city living. In the summer months you can also go at night time to follow the Fire Fly trails. I ate some soba there too which were really yummy :)
Sankeien:  An Oasis of Green and Calm,"Providing a soothing contrast to Yokohama's futuristic Minato Mirai cityscape, Sankeien delights the eye with a rich display of natural beauty.  Especially striking in the fall, Sankeien opens selected evenings for harvest moon viewing-- and sometimes sponsors delightful open air concerts.  However, Sankeien's beautiful gardens and historic buildings (some of which are designated national treasures) are beautiful throughout the year, with each season bringing its own special natural treats.  Be sure wear your walking shoes and to bring a camera as the various settings provide multiple photo opportunities.  Plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you plan to cover most of the garden. In the tranquil environment, it is not unusual to see kimono-clad couples posing for wedding pictures.  Traditional snacks or refreshments are available at a several locations.  In a shop adjacent to the on-site museum which highlights the history of the garden's founder, an early silk merchant and an important patron of traditional arts, kimono-clad women serve green tea prepared in the traditional style.  While the garden is a little out of the way (it is accessible by bus from central Yokohama), it is a great way to escape the concrete of the city and enjoy the feel of an older and more aesthetic Japan.  If you don't have the time to visit Kyoto or Nara and still want to enjoy the charm of a traditional garden and setting, Sankeien is a great choice."
Historic and beautiful place to visit,"These are beautiful gardens on many acres with historic buildings, a temple, and a lake filled with koi.  Spent much longer than I anticipated walking through the gardens.  It was breathtaking.  There was a show of bonsai Azaleas and they were incredible.   There is a little refreshment stand to purchase drinks and ice cream which was delicious on a hot day.  Lovely places to sit and take refuge in the garden.  A wedding photo session was taking place so we watched a beautifully dressed bride and groom posing in the gardens.  As beautiful as a garden in Kyoto."
One of the most beautiful gradens in Japan,"A huge, spacious gardens to roam and stroll in.   The water lilies looked so beautiful and tranquil in the ponds, glittering in the summer heat.   I can just imagine what glorious it looks in the changing autumn colours.   There was a nice shop attached to the garden where nice, dainty, Japanese fans and other souvenirs were sold.  Hope to see it again!"
"Nice, relaxing place","Really nice garden, albeit quite small. Very realxing, ideal to visit if it's too hot. It's quite far from the railway station - better take a bus if it's hot."
April stunning cherry blossom viewing,"We caught the bus from Minato Mirai station for Sankeien Gardens in April when the cherry blossom was just about at it's best.  The walk from the bus stop to the entrance was very inviting with the trees in full bloom showing us the way to the gardens.  It was a lovely brisk day and there were plenty of people heading towards the entrance.  We had bought some sushi at the railway station before we left so we could experience a real Hanami outing.  We walked all around the gardens and even climbed up to the Pagoda and the lookout. The gardens were very beautiful with all the cherry blossoms out in bloom.  There are a few eating places selling great looking foods in case you dont bring your own and you can sit at the outside tables and chairs that they supply admiring the scenery at the same time. There were a lot of brides having photos taken in this beautiful setting, so if you happen to visit when the cherry blossoms are in bloom you will be amazed at the beautiful dresses these ladies are wearing.  It is a great time to visit.  Also just outside the entrance there is a small stall selling local foods and we just had to try their own homemade cherry blossom icecream even though it was quite a cool day.  The owner is very happy to have you sit while you are eating and even gave us a warm drink after.  He would not take any money for the drink.  Great hospitality from this small family business."
beautiful,"I love to be there makes you come back very beautiful pretty arrangements, children are able to run freely and enjoy"
"A lovely, relaxing way to spend the afternoon","The gardens are quite large and have a variety of plants blooming throughout the year.  We went in the summer, when the water lilies are in full bloom (early mornings only, while it's still cool) and took a hike up the hill to see the panoramic view (not that great, but there's a nice breeze).  With all the plum trees, it looks like it would be a nice place to come in late winter to see some beautiful blossoms.  There's a lovely little restaurant/cafe type shop where you can get tea, drinks or delicious kakigori (Japanese style shaved ice).  There's even an English menu!  Very easy to get to via bus (from Yokohama Station, about 35 mins and only ¥220) and entry to the garden is just ¥500.  A great way to spend the afternoon!"
Nice place to spend some time,"It is a big garden in Yokohama. You can spend around 2 hours walking in the premises and admiring the architecture and the environment. A very peaceful place to go and enjoy, mainly if it is on a good day weather. A big pond with carps, another pond with lotus and some nice old examples of Japanese style constructions. You can enjoy a tea ceremony if you want and refresh yourself as they have another open cafe with Japanese treats. There is a 3 store pagoda on the top of the hill, not exceptional but with some history. If you are in the area and want to enjoy some quiet time, good to go.  Entrance is 500 yen each and a parking fee of 500 + yen(2 hrs) depending on how long you stay."
"Beautiful Garden, one of the must-visits in Yokohama.","The garden was clean (like any other places in Japan) and although it was cloudy when I went, I could very much feel the historic and cultural atmosphere. The only attraction for children may be the traditional housing brought from Shirakawa-go and also the view from the observatory on top of the mountain (come with sneakers if you wish to go there).  If you go slowly and visit almost every attraction within the park, it took us about 2 hours full."
Lovely place,"Very peaceful, and relaxing. It's easy to get there by the number 8 bus from Yokohama etc. the bus drops you near the gardens and does a loop, so you can take the return back just a little further on the same road. As an added bonus, it's one of the only places in Tokyo area which isn't absolutely packed with people."
A nice piece of tranquillity,Very pleasant to visit. We went on a Sunday and saw a number of wedding processions that added to our experience
One of the most beautiful parks in Yokohama,"One of Yokohama's best bargains at only 500yen/adult. 175000㎡ of gorgeous scenery, complete with seventeen old buildings and temples.The park has special events throughout the year, so be sure to check their website before you make plans to go."
A truly beautiful place,"Serene and beautiful place. A must visit in Yokohama! The total area is beautifully set up with a lakes full of fish and birds, blooming flowers all over, and a Pagoda overlooking the garden. The Bonsasi collection is amazing and so are the buildings, tea houses, and the lovely walking paths."
Peaceful escape,"Its a lovely place if you want an escape from the hussle in the city. Its peaceful and quite, I most liked the old house,reminds  me so much of the Last samurai movie. Its worth the visit, plus the entrance is only 500 yen."
Over rated garden,"I was really disappointed with this place because it was highly recommended by others. Also, it's quite far and inconvenient.  It's just a garden that has structures from different parts of Japan. Maybe, I got over these types of gardens. I just liked the lake here and thats it."
Beautiful garden,"This is a lovely place to take a stroll and enjoy nature,  we came here during end of winter and some of the plum trees are starting to bloom. There are many different type of building from different period of history and being well taken care off. You can also enjoy a tee ceremony inside. We ended up having udon soup at one of the restaurant inside before leaving. Lovely place.."
IT IS A MUST,We were in Yokohama for a Congress and the Tourism Office of Yokohama highly recommended us to visit this Japanese typical park. We did it and we were not disappointed at all. This is something like doing a visit of Japan and having the opportunity to see in the same time the old and the new Japan. The parks contain 14 different areas (themes). this is easy to make the visit. The prize entrance is cheap. And the park is well served by public transportation. The park is totaly wheelchair accessible. We highly recommend the visit of the park to all visitors of the city of Yokohama. It is a must.
"This is not a Garden, but a Collection of Buildings from Various Eras","This large facility is less of a garden and more of a collection of buildings from various periods in Japanese history.  A wealthy businessman purchased these buildings form various parts of Japan and had them erected at this site outside of Yokohama.  In addition, he built a residence for himself in 1920.  Later a modern building was constructed to house some pieces of art and to display a tribute to the wealthy silk merchant, Sankei Hara.  Not shying from immodesty, he called this facility ""Sankei-en"" (meaning Sankei's garden), later passing away in 1939. You can go into one of the Edo period buildings (the old Yonohara house moved to Sankei-en from Gifu Prefecture), a wealthy farmer's house, and see artifacts from that period.  This is very interesting.  Unfortunately, none of the other buildings are accessible, and can only be seen from a distance.  There is an observatory (viewing platform) up on a hill in the very back of the garden, but the sweeping view is made up of oil refineries, tank farms, industrial installations, and a massive freeway.  You must watch your step because the paths and stairways are not in good repair.  Also up on the hill is a three tiered pagoda from the Muromachi period (what does this have to do with the garden?).There were various shrines scattered around the facility, but they didn't make much sense and did not add to the beauty of the place.  On the other hand, there was an attractive wisteria arbor and many nicely constructed period bridges.I feel uncomfortable calling this facility a ""garden"", because that would insult the many beautiful gardens throughout Japan.  It wasn't until long after Sankei Hara died that any pines were added, and to this day there are virtually no stones (the most important feature of any Japanese garden) on display.  The quality of the gardening and pruning is either absent or clunky.  Much was overgrown, and there were weeds everywhere.  The pruning of the pines was mediocre, and what they do to the plum trees is just plain weird.  The ponds are murky, stagnant water.  Overall, the facility is unattractive.In the modern building (offices and art displays), ladies in kimonos were inviting visitors to partake of the tea ceremony, which was a nice experience.  There is a small restaurant in the back where we enjoyed beer, tempura, and green tea ice cream.In summary, if you are interested architecture you should visit Sankei-en.  If you are interested in Japanese gardens, you need not bother coming here.  From Shibui and wabi-sabi, not a trace.  This is a shocking story of a rich man's search for his cultural roots that somehow become lost in the rise and clamber of the middle class during the Edo period.  Sadly, he failed."
Excellent reason for a daytrip from Tokyo,This is not only a beautiful Japanese garden. It is also a museum that contains some amazing old Japanese architecture. We used it to beat the heat this past Sunday and absolutely adored it.
Beautiful garden and great landscape,It's a beautiful garden with vast landscape. But plz remember to come during the spring/autumn season or you shall be disappointed. If you are in the right season garden blossoms very well.
Peaceful place,"Definitely worth to visit. Mother nature is just beautiful and you can definitely experience it here. Also do the tea cup ceremony, you can actually see the respect this culture express among themselves when serving tea. You can also see the inside of the Japanese homes."
Japanese Garden,"I really enjoyed the commentary provided by Suzuki in the farmers house, one of the many well placed buildings in the gardens"
relax & enjoy a lovely garden-park,"Sankei-en is a lovely natural park in Yokohama that used to be the private garden of a very rich man. Although it's a little difficult to get to, if you want to see a beautifully laid out Japanese garden, ask at your hotel how to get there, and go. I’ve gone many times, and enjoyed it every time. I can't remember it ever being crowded. Other people are there, but the place is large, and I've never felt that the atmosphere was other than quiet and restful. The gardens are mainly greenery plus the pond, but there are seasonal flowers as well. I remember being stunned by gorgeous lotus flowers last summer.When I'm there, I walk around the pond, and enjoy the pagoda and natural greenery. For a tiny additional fee, I go into an area that has old houses and other structures that the rich man brought there so that they would be preserved. I most enjoy going into the spacious home of a three-generation family that raised silk worms. It's possible to walk throughout the whole house, including the attic that was the home of the worms. There are small exhibits explaining about the silk-raising process."
"Very nice garden, worth a visit","The gardens are really nice, lots to see. My only disappointment is that the grounds and around the pagodas are not well groomed or maintained. I asked my guide and she explained that the gardens do not raise much money to maintain and a lot of the upkeep is volunteer.  I think more people should visit the grounds and help contribute. There are some really remarkable structures and history to this place."
My most favourite garden in Japan,"I absolutely loved the Sankei-en garden. I went on one beautiful Monday morning in May, paid 500 yen and was mesmerised... There was hardly anyone there. It was so peaceful with no crowds. The garden is very large with lots of old houses that were transferred here from Kyoto and Kamakura. But everything feels so natural as if the houses have been here ever since. There was not many flowers in bloom but it was amazing to just walk around, take pictures and listen to the sound of water and heaps of bird noises. There were lots of signs in English, so you could learn more about the houses and history of the park.The former Yonoharake house is open to the public, so you can wander through and see how people lived some years ago. It has a very wide collection historical objects and to me it felt even more authentic than the houses in Shirakawa-go! There are also super nice and knowledgeable volunteers that are always happy to help and answer your questions. I visited many gardens during my trip around Japan - in Kyoto, Nara, Kanazawa... and this one was definitely my most favourite one!It is a little bit out of town centre so with the transportation plan at least 3 hours or half a day to spend there."
Stunning cherry blossom,Definitely worth the trip to see these gorgeous gardens.  The tea ceremony is worth a visit.  The cherry blossom was gorgeous but the gardens would be lovely at most times of the year
Taking bus from Yokohama station.,"As we don't drive a car,  we took but from Bus stop near Sogo,8 or 148 route.  This park is quite large so you might enjoy picnic.  When I was child,  I often came to swimming pool adjacent to Sankeien."
Walk,"A place where you enjoy walking while taking pictures and experiencing  japanese huge garden. My sister and her sons.. really like the place, of course me and my lil princess"
Highlight of Trip,Sankei-en Gardens was one of the highlights of my trip to Japan.  The buildings moved to Sankei-en are well preserved and each is perfectly situated in the landscape.
Serene haven,Peaceful and picturesqueWhen I visited it was not crowdedGood representation of Japanese architectureEnjoyed the tea ceremony and the ladies who were very patient in explaining basics to meThe wait staff at the ramen place were friendlyPerfect place for photo enthusiasts as the place provides a lot of good photo opportunities
Tranquility and Serenity in one Place,A beautiful place to enjoy your time leisurely as this offers Tranquility and Serenity. We toured the place one morning and had attended a meeting in one of they're traditional Japanese style rooms in their facility.
A Beauty,"For less then $5 USD you can have a relaxing walk around a garden, my family went when it was gloomy and rainy and cold so couldn't enjoy as much. Some of the cherry blossoms were budding also."
sakura,"nice place to view plum blossoms and the Pagoda. Historic, beautiful and impressively maintained. you can spend 4 to 5 hours here"
Wonderful Blossom,"Lovely quiet park with great buildings to explore, Blossom was fabulous at this time. Easy ride from the centre of Yokohama"
Cherry blossoms and tea ceremony,"Our visit on March 27, 2015 was a bit early for full bloom but we did see a number of trees filled with pink cherry blossoms. We were a group of 9 ladies. I like the blissful ambience of the whole park and most especially our tea ceremony. It was free. We entered the tea room in the reception building and sat down on the vacant seats. We were offered tea  with 2 sugary little cakes. An explanation was given while the tea was being prepared. The tea was a strong green concoction. I haven't tasted it before in my life. It was a short yet fulfilling experience.  Completing the park tour is a real nature trek.  In my next chance to go to Yokohama, I might just do it again."
beautiful garden and pond,"beautiful garden with lots of plants , very traditional .i was there for the hanami , cherry blossom season, it was very beautiful. it also has a beautiful three tiered pagoda."
Beautiful garden,Indeed it was worthwhile to visit this garden for the cherry/plum blossom even though not all flowers are blooming.  Entrance fee was 500 yen.  We met a wedding couple dressed in traditional wedding costume.  Then we had a good lunch and also tasted the cherry blossom ice cream just next to the garden.
Peaceful place in Yokohama,"Very spacious traditional Japanese garden. It wasn't so good season for seeing flowers, but iris was in bloom when I visited there. We can taste also Japanese tea and sweets inside of memorial hall. Good connection from Sakuragicho or Yokohama station by bus."
Escape the hurley-burley,"Yokohoma, one of Japan's biggest cities as well as one of the busiest ports on the planet; small wonder then that things can be a bit chaotic in the town centre. Escape all that and relax for a few hours in the Sankeien Gardens. Well laid out, with several lakes of varying size, this is a Japanese garden to soothe jangled senses. It has paths that wind in and out of wooded areas and groups buildings that have been brought from other Japanese cities. The explanation of the building's significance is provided. Very interesting.Well worth the time to get here. Entrance fee reasonable. Small restaurant available."
Go on a sunny day when the light is good,"Beautiful, expansive, virtually free, interesting history, you can try Japanese tea making, there's light food and coffee there, it's peaceful and representative of Japan gardens and parks from all over Japan."
Not a Winter Attraction,"I think in a few weeks these gardens will be lovely, but we went early March, and it was cold, muddy and raining.  Nothing was blooming.  We walked up to the pagoda and walked all the paths.  The Ducks were fun to watch in the pond, but they weren't any different than the ducks we see in ponds in America.  I am sure snow would have made the place prettier, but rain just didn't make for a pleasant visit.  And the town of Yokohama is an industrial town, so even innthebrain, there was a foul odor."
Relaxing walk,"Plenty of history and nature combined in a park, there is english on the attraction descriptions and if you follow the route around the gardens you will get a good amount of exercise, ensure you walk up to the lookout and 3 storied pagoda."
A little Kyoto in Yokohama,"No need to visit Kyoto. Just visit the Sankeien gardens at least each of the 4 seasons around the year. Fall is colourful, snow gardens  in beautiful, Sakura is pretty and Summer in great."
"Not, Ebisu Gardens, But the Real Deal","Visiting the Yokohama City area and want a bit of tranquility and tradition, then you should visit the Sankeien Gardens. Recently, visitors wanted to see Japanese Gardens,and were directed to see Ebisu Gardens in Tokyo. Much to their disappointment, these are not gardens at all in the traditional sense but a huge shopping mall-like venue. So I took them to Sankeien, and they were amazed by the immediate transformation from modern city life, to the traditional, tranquil garden sights along with the beauty of the architecture that is trademark Sankeien. There are ponds strategically placed and old wooden bridges with lotus blossoms peaking thru, while the carp in the ponds await your morsels of bread. . The bread is to be purchased at the nearby vendor and you can enjoy the pleasure of feeding the carp around the many ponds. The experience can be satisfying for children and adults alike. The architecture and the landscaping are simply fantastic, and you will marvel at nearly every step you take, and will want to photograph it to keep as one of your  treasured memories of your visit. You can also take a rest while walking the gardens, as there are many benches provided and you can buy some light foods as well. There is also the opportunity to brown-bag or 'bento' your lunch as well. There are places to sit and have a nice lunch. Depending to the time of year, it can be a quiet, private time, or it can be a crowded and some of the tranquility is lost. I've visited twice last year, and both were during the cold weather season, so not to crowded and very peaceful. Another really great thing about it, is that you can call ahead and get the schedule for the tea ceremonies that are held inside the small museum area. The ladies are wear the traditional Japanese kimono and will demonstrate how tea is prepared. After preparing the tea, they serve you and explain how the tea should the receiver should drink the tea. It's a great experience for everyone. You can take great photos with the ladies sitting dressed in kimono in front of the tea making area (not sure what it's called). The only thing that can be annoying sometimes is if it's crowded and then the experience is not as pleasant, but still a winner. You can always 'escape' the heavily populated areas as the gardens are so vast, that if you keep walking around, you can find a tranquil place and reflect. There is an entrance fee, and a bit on the pricey side, but there is a discount for the over seventy persons, with proper identification. Depending on the season, there are different events being held at any given time, for example, fire fly night sessions, when specific flowers are in bloom, they sometimes have night events. So best to call ahead or check the net about what's going on. Enjoy!"
Traditional Japanese Garden in Yokohama,"If you want to see a traditional Japanese Garden, please visit here.  There is a good museum, lotus ponds, traditional Japanese buildings.  In Sakura season, it is lit up at night, and is magical.  Might see engaged couples in traditional dress getting their pictures taken.  Bring your camera."
Hidden gem in Industrial Yokohama,"Sankeien Gardens is a slice of tranquillity located in the hustle and bustle of Yokohama.These gardens and buildings are beautifully laid out with amazing scenery that gives you a great taste of Japanese culture landscaping and architecture.An amazing view of the surrounding harbour and on clear days, Mount Fuji, is available from the lookout located near the 3-story pagoda.Several small cafes/kiosks are located throughout the gardens selling a range of traditional snacks, ice-creams, cold and warm drinks.Guided tours are available at different times although I was lucky enough to find a volunteer helper who was very keen to develop his English skills and happily guided me around the gardens explaining all of the details of the buildings, vegetation and general layout of the gardens. An English map is also available when you purchase your entry ticket to the garden.My method of access to the gardens from Yokohama was via the train system on the Negishi Line to Yamate station. From here it is a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the gardens.Taxi routinely service the entry to the gardens so access back to the train for return to Yokohama station is simple and convenient.If you are looking for an escape from the hustle and bustle of Yokohama, be certain to visit these gardens."
Sankeien Gardens worth seeing.,Was in Yokohama for business and had a day off.  Took the bus from a stop near my hotel.  I pointed on a map to where I wanted to get off and the drive let me know the stop.  The gardens are a self guided tour for the most part with volunteer docents in one of the historic buildings.  I attend a tea ceremony which was certainly worth seeing.  The gardens have many historic building that give you a sense of Japanese history.
Caress your soul,"Finally I saw true beauty of Yokohama. Beautiful place with unique atmosphere. Many things were moved from Kyoto so you can really see the true beauty of Japanese architecture here. I visited Sankeien Garden in December but trees were still full of colours. Amazing to see this beauty in red/green/golden colours.. What a feeling. It was Saturday afternoon and I was lucky I saw a wedding in traditional Japanese clothes. Take your time, walk slowly and inhale that smell of fresh falling leaves."
Natural beauty,"Spent several hours in this park, which has a rugged natural beauty unlike the well manicured parks found elsewhere in Japan."
Nothing special and notable here! Eating their cherry blossom ice cream and black sesame omochi was the highlight!,"Somehow, the garden reminded me of the garden of Ryoan-ji in Kyoto.  The Shukuoen garden in Hiroshima is much much better.  Nothing special and notable here.  I think its reputation is overblown!  We meet a friendly old man who goes to this garden at least 3 times a week and he suggested we should try their unique cherry blossom ice cream and black sesame omochi which we did and that was the highlight of the visit to this garden."
Nooks and Crannies,"Very large, beautiful strolling garden that is well maintained and a joy to visit, but give yourself time to do so.  There are lots of things to see tucked away from the main pathways that are well worth the effort to explore.  If you are truly interested in traditional Japanese architecture,or just enjoy Japanese gardens, this is a wonderful location to get away from it all.  Very conveniently located, with plenty of space, ""far from the madding crowd,"" as Thomas Hardy would have put it. When we were there, a young couple was having their wedding portrait taken in traditional Japanese kimonos staged in front of some the older buildings, but the location was pretty uncrowded, particularly for a Sunday."
The exotic part of Yokohama,Peaceful and fascinating. Worth a 2-3 hours visit to get a feel of old Japan instead of Yokohama's modern grey buildings
Beautiful peaceful park,More than just a lovely garden. Has architectural examples of traditional homes and a tea ceremony. Easy to access with public transportation
Beautiful Japanese Garden,"Being in this garden evokes a sense of tranquility & well-being. The trees, the Cherry Blossoms, the pond with some ducks swimming, the pagoda on top of the hill overlooking the gardens all were nicely put together & well-maintained.  There's also a kiosk which serves some refreshments."
Relaxing walk among the flowers,"It's a bit long to get there, unless you take a taxi, because you have to go to Motomachi station and then take the bus no.8 on the opposite side of the road and...hope to get off at the right stop! Once you get there you can forget about the distress for the journey, and walk in the gardens around the lake, watching the koi- carps , the swans and duck, the turtles, the fantastic contrasts in the colors of flowers and trees, you can also visit the pagoda up the hill an and ancient abandoned villa which you can guess how pleasant it should have been before all the refineries and the LNG plants were built all around the area"
One of Japans Best,"We had a Full day stop over in Yokohama during a recent Cruise, we had read about and reserached these Gardens so decided to visit them. It is possible to catch a Bus to the Gardens from near the Port Area but we took the easy way as there where 4 of us and took a Taxi. Between us it only cost about $2.50 each ($10 Aust Total) and was very Convinent. Distance about 5KM.As with most gardens in Japan there is an entrance fee but it is quite reasonable 500 Yen for Adults. We spent several hours exploring and enjoying the gardens which also contain 17 Historical Buildings that have been transported from other areas of japan and rebuilt within the Gardens. Unfortunatley only ONE is open for the Public to explore inside but the others are interesting from the outside.The Gardens also have an Observatory and a 3 Storey Pagoda. A Main Pond and several other water features. All up I would say, Beautiful, Interesting and well worth Visiting. Allow about 3 Hours to enjoy properly."
good but overrated,"Sankeien Garden is a good japanese garden but not the best landmark in Yokohama. If you have just two days in Yokohama, I highly recommend that you skip the garden, your time will be best spent on Minato Mirai and other attractions.  The garden itself is very simple, but beautiful. It is good, but not great."
Beautiful views and a friendly staff,"This place was a joy to visit. The views were wonderful (I give 4 stars because I wasn't blown away or anything, but it was still very nice), and the local food was delicious."
One of my favorite Japanese gardens,"If you haven't visited a traditional Japanese garden, then you can do much worse than this one.  Visit in any season but winter and go on a weekday to avoid the crowds.  It is a little out of the way (otherwise, I would visit much more frequently than I do) but it is well worth the effort with its great variety of buildings, flora and nooks and crannies to explore."
Very peaceful place,"Thanks to the guide, I liked the history of the place, the structure, the walk and little hike to to go to top of the Pagode"
Green oasis in Yokohama,"A delightful garden oasis with beautiful views among winding paths, little streams and bridges, and several traditional buildings to explore. Large black butterflies were fluttering around and the extensive lotus field was in full bloom when we visited on a hot July afternoon. There are several little tearooms where you can find traditional refreshments such as shaved ice - we enjoyed cherry blossom ice cream. The garden can be easily reached by local bus from central Yokohama. Would be amazing to see the irises and cherry trees in bloom in the spring, and witness the autumn colours! Worth a visit every season. Very few non-Japanese visitors though."
An oasis in the concrete jungle,"Sankeien was originally the home and very spacious garden of a wealthy silk merchant. He bought a number of beautiful old buildings and had them brought to Yokohama, placed in the gardens and restored. There are temple buildings  (including a pagoda), tea houses, a large farmhouse, a bridge, a lake, etc.I have been to Sankeien many times over the years and never get tired of it. I recommend visiting on a weekday as early in the morning as possible, when there are fewer people, or later in the afternoon. It tends to get crowded on weekends. You can get there by bus or taxi from Negishi Station, on the JR Keihin Tohoku Negishi Line, which runs through Yokohama Station. Make sure you have a good look around the Inner Garden, which contains the best buildings, some of which are hidden amongst the trees. The best time of year? Any season other than winter, when most of the trees have lost their leaves, the grass is brown and the garden is generally drab, unless you are lucky enough to visit after a rare fall of snow."
Wonderful tour,We toured the Sankeien Gardens with friends from Yokohama and had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the lotus blossoms very much and the trails were pleasant to walk with many fantastic sight lines.
Beautiful! Worth the time,"A beautiful respite from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo/Yokohama.  Beautiful restored historic home and buildings scattered among acres of lush Japanese gardens.  A Wonderful way to enjoy a day or just a few hours.  Several very good little lunch spots within the gardens.  Very walk-able.  Though I speak no Japanese, I was able to easily travel here from Yokohama by myself simply by carrying one of their flyers with me, which was readily available at our hotel.  Definitely a high light of our trip to Japan."
"Well, not so keen","As this garden was suggested by most visitor guides, I was there in July but... not so keen on it. If you have a full day, I would suggest you better take the train and go visit nearby places (Tokyo most obviously but also Kamakura is really great and so is Odawara and Hakone)"
Beautiful garden,"I can see green everywhere. Mediation. Relaxing. :)You can enjoy the lake full of lotuses, the pagoda, the houses combined of tradition and modern. And there are 2 super cute cats there :)One of my best traditional place in Yokohama"
Worth a Visit,"Great place to visit if you are in Yokohama. You need to get a taxi to and from the Train station as it is hard to find otherwise.Take your time and enjoy the paths and view, there are a couple of eating places but no one speaks english, but are all very friendly. Would highly recommend a visit here."
beautiful gardens in big city,"These are beautiful gardens with some very old historic buildings that have been transplanted here from different parts of Japan. It is an easy taxi ride or bus from central Yokohama. We visited when the Irises were in flower. Check out the view from the belvedere: an oil refinery that was not here when the gardens were originally planted. It makes you appreciate the gardens, and reminded me of Port Talbot. There are also some very cool cats who live here."
All your temple needs in one location!,"This location is outside Yokohama, but was fairly simple to get to based on their website directions. Train, bus, and walk later (stand and watch through the bus windscreen for the stop names on the bus shelters or you will go too far!!) and you are there from Yokohama hotel area.It was a beautiful, relaxing and amazing garden - built by a wealthy Japanese business man - who relocated real temples, pagodas and building designs from across Japan to the one location (noting that Yokohama was extensively destroyed / burned during WW2). Beautifully laid out with a large lake, streams, and tree covered walks.You get too see real examples of a range of old Japanese architecture styles and building types in one location. Very few Western tourists there (the volunteer staff asked how we knew it was there)."
Best Japanese garden we visited,"A wonderful example of a Japanese garden, stylised pruning of pine trees, wisteria trained over elevated trellises, irises in bloom all manicured to perfection. Surrounded by the city but still peaceful.The views change constantly as you walk so it's hard to move without taking photographs at every turn. Large carp in the lake, bridges, buildings moved here from various locations around Japan.Without doubt the highlight of the trip, if I could visit only one garden this would be it. Allow yourself plenty of time, don't try you rush around, sit and enjoy the views."
Zen,"Loved this attraction, what a great escape from the city!  I recommend you be sure to visit the building that allows you to take off your shoes and experience traditional Japan.  It really was a wonderful way to spend a morning!"
