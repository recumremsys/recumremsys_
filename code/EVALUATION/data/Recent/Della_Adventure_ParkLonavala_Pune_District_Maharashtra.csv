Amazing della,It was a nice day. There are many activities for kids and adults as well.  Prasad was a good employing Della of archery The hospitality was excellent
Dogs in Small cages ,"The dogs are held in small cages with 2-3 dogs in each cage. They urinate there itself and keep barking and are in a lot of stress.Whenever a door of cage is opened to let one dog out for guest, the other dogs are desperate to come out and are very distressed.The dogs also have choking neck collars.Pathetic condition for the poor animals and the company blissfully claims itself to be animal lovers.Please improve the condition of the dogs, keep them in a separate enclosed area with some space to move!"
Worth Visiting,Adventure activities are good and cater for all age groups and consists of different levels of adventure.Please improve parking facility.
Good place for adventu,Please incorporate anniversary special in your adventure camp tickets section. More people would turn if you do.
Best place for adventure,What i like the most is rope activities.And support staff was good also the environment.GRE guys also very supportive.
HAD A AMAZING TIME,All the activities where really good. Had gone on a Monday so less crowd and could do all the activities without waiting. Would recommend going on a weekday (except Friday). And if you want to have more fun take the jumbo pass. Water and food is very expensive inside.
Nice,Please keep water filter every where and there is no dustbin in park. overall the adventure is awesome.
Not Worth of Money Being Charged,"All things in park to much costly, All ride's are payable. Receptionist are so rude and make us wait for an hour almost for getting in. Overall had a bad experience."
Must visit,"Kids enjoyed it. The rides were very nice. The kids loved walking with the dogs, they cherish that memory everyday. The staff is courteous and very  co-operative. Must visit place."
It‚Äôs very costly,I wish there were water cooler in few of the corners we had to buy water that was inconsiderate of them. I feel animals specially dogs with fur should be in kept in cold place. Also if every one gets a harness it‚Äôs so tiring to put one on and remove for every other activity. That would save tons of time.
very poor management,Della is totally mismanaged even in weekdays we had to wait for small small activities also .There was only one attendant  at each sports activity which creates lot of chaos . The team was not at all helpful. For each and every problem we had to go to reservation area as no proper deporting of staff.Also very very small small activities are also chargeable high inspite of huge entrance charges .
Great Fun,Amazing activities... Full of fun..Specially shotting range and had great time in net cricket with prasad

All good,"Good concept. Their Activities will keep you busy throughout. All their activities are for adults mostly. Very few of them for kids under 18. Good place to test someone's physical endurance.Just felt terribly sad about an activity. In the Dog Walking activity, you get to walk with a dog. There they have husky and other breeds of dogs that survive only in snowy areas. They keep them in an air conditioned cold room to cope up with that thing. How irony is that since their volunteers write, ""We love animals"". Atleast they should keep only those dog breeds that can withstand lonavala temperature without the need of air conditioners and similar synthetic situations. Let the huskies and similar breeds be freed."
A-Zone in Della Adventures,Good place to spend a day with your friends. The staff here is very friendly. There aren't as many activities as listed I feel. Mr TJ guided us in selecting the best of the activities.

My Worst experience ever,"This was my 5th visit to Della's. I am one of their customers who till date thought Della is good. I had the worst experience yesterday. I had booked 2 rooms one in camp Della and other in Della villas. I was staying in the room in Della villas which had a very poor quality of material and this huge glass in my bathroom broke while I was in the bathtub. It was a life threatening scenario and I'm still traumatized by it. I have uploaded the images of this in my review. The staff then shifted me to this one room which is on the ground floor with an open Jacuzzi, so I asked them is there full privacy? to which they said yes, and I later on found out that one can easily see you while you're bathing which exploited my privacy. I have also attached my Jacuzzi pics from top view. Then there was no internet at night, they gave me a modem which was so poor quality of internet it took hours for some websites to load and I couldn't even work from my room. I had planned a business visit to which my work went for a toss and I've never seen such 5 star property with so poor internet connection. That's basic these days I'm not sure Della is aware of it. Or maybe their definition of good is too bad. So to all this experience they offered me an apology. That's all that there was. They gave me a 20 percent discount of 400rs on my food bill. I am like seriously? All my dishes were way more expensive than that compensation and is that what my life is worth? After paying them 50k, I would not recommend you'll to visit Dellas for staying at least, and if you're staying make sure your rooms are in a good shape. lonavala has better properties I am sure."
