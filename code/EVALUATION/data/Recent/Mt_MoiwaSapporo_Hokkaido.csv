Great excursion to the summit of Mt. Moiwa!,"Great excursion involving various forms of transportation to get to the summit of Mt. Moiwa (531m).  First you need to take the subway to Susukino subway station (Station N08 on the Namboku Subway Line), then interchange with the Sapporo Streetcar (tram) at street level (Streetcar stop SC23).   Take the tram to Ropeway Iriguchi (Streetcar stop SC10); 11-stops anticlockwise or 13-stops in a clockwise direction.  Close by the Ropeway tram stop, there is a bus stop with turning circle for the Ropeway shuttle bus; a green 4WD, hi-wheelbase minibus, which takes 5-mins to negotiate the climb up the hill to the Moiwa Base Station.The 1st leg from Base Station to Mid Station is by Ropeway; the gondola can accommodate up to 66 passengers for the 5-min journey and gondolas depart every 15-mins.  At Mid  Station you transfer to the Mo-risu Cars which transport you to the Summit Station in 2-mins.  The Mo-risu consist of a pair of mini cable cars in tandem; each can hold 30 passengers (60 in total) and also depart every 15-mins.When I travelled on a January Monday morning, traffic was surprisingly light and blessed with good visibility the views of snow-covered Sapporo from the summit were spectacular.  Great excursion, enjoyed the transportation and a special shout-out to Mt. Moiwa Ropeway for giving a discount to Senior Citizens like myself!"
Lovely View of Sapporo,The view from the top was beautiful.  Playing in the snow was fun.  It was really fun to watch a family from Malaysia playing in the snow for their first time!  We enjoyed talking to people from around the world.
Weather and views were fabulous,"Visited with familyPros1) There was a free shuttle from the tram station. As usual, the shuttle driver was helpful especially we had a baby in tow.2) Went there right after breakfast, which was just right for a family with baby. But it would have been more perfect night time with the city lights view.3) Weather was nice. Coming from a tropical country, the almost winter weather was nice and cooling.4) They had several snack shops and a restaurant, so food is not really a problem.5) Some of my family members opted to hike going up Mt. Moiwa but most of us took the cable car which had amazing views. Mt Moiwa is perfect for hikers!6) The place was picturesque.7) There is also a souvenir shop, toilet is not a problem.If you love outdoors and nice views this place is for you! Very recommended!"
"Mt. Moiwa, Sapporo",Visited Mt. Moiwa  on 19 Feb 20. Took a public bus from Susikino Station to the Ropeway station. It is worth the visit with beautiful views and snow.....during sunset time
Stunning views of mountains and city,"As the cable car ascends, you are able to notice the wide area of the city. Once you have reached the top, you can take plentiful pictures of mountains on one side and the city on the other. Great way to enjoy the views. The main center piece in the middle is great for selfies too. Overall, a great place to be, without a doubt."
See the view and the Bell of Love,"Mount Moiwa is a highlight of Sapporo's nightlife. You get a great nightscape over the city of Sapporo; the sunset is spectacular. A spcial feature for photographers is the Bell of Love, which is supposed to confer a special blessing on newlyweds. To get to Mount Moiwa from the city , take the tram and then the shuttle bus to the base of the ropeway, which goes about two-thirds of the way to the summit. You will then take the distinctive cable car to the summit. At the top, there's a restaurant and observation deck, plus the Bell of Love. We enjoyed the ascent of Mount Moiwa, it can get chilly at the summit."
Panoramic 360 Degree View of Sapporo!,"Superb view of Sapporo and beyond!  Great for picture and video taking.  Awesome ""black and white view"" with winter-powder snow and tree or mountain contrast."
Top view of  Sapporo City,"If you want to see  the top view or  night view of sapporo city, this place is where you lookig forYou can travel by tram to the station (mention in tram map of mt.moiwa) and took free shuttle bus to the ropewayOn the deck floor you can shoot the sapporo view from there. There is a bell of love as a gimmick for you to take a memory picture too"
"Mount Moiwa, Wonderful During Winter","I visited Mount Moiwa on 5 February 2020. It was my first time being there on my winter budget trip in Hokkaido, Japan.TransportationIt is really convenient to reach many places in Hokkaido if you stay near big stations like Sapporo or Odori. I stayed near Sapporo station (I will write about the accommodation in a separate review). I took a walk from the station to Odori station and then Susukino station via underpass including a shopping tunnel called Pole Town to avoid the cold air. The distance between Sapporo and Susukino station is 1.6 km. The duration will depend on the walking speed.After reaching Susukino station, I took exit with the sign ""Street Car"" then took the tram to reach the closest station to Mount Moiwa, Iriguchi rope way station. It took about 20 minutes to get the rope way station and I paid JPY200 per adult. Child fare was JPY100 per child.The Street Car line is actually a closed-double-loops (inner and outer), before taking the tram, please make sure that the loop line will stop at Iriguchi rope way station. From Iriguchi rope way station there are two alternatives to reach Mount Moiwa lower terminal: by walking for about 10 to 15 minutes or by taking the free shuttle bus. I took the free shuttle bus which departed every 15 minutes from 10:45 a.m. since the opening hours of Mount Moiwa is 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. during winter.At the lower terminal I bought a two-way-ticket for rope way and cable car to reach the highest point of Mount Moiwa. The fare was JPY1,700 per adult for a return trip. Child fare was JPY850 per child. The transfer between rope way and cable car in the middle terminal was very convenient. The duration of both rope way and cable car was about 30 minutes one way including the transfer.ActivitiesDuring winter, the highest point of Mount Moiwa becomes a snow playground which provides scenic views of surrounding mountains and the Sapporo city. When I got there I saw many families with young children playing snow and some people visited and prayed at the small shrine there. There were two favorite spots at Mount Moiwa which attracted many visitors to take pictures at: ""The Fortune Bell"" and ""Love Padlock"". There were also some shops and cafe at the terminal to keep visitors warm from the cold air outside.Time To VisitTo enjoy the snow playground especially with young children, it is better to visit there at morning or afternoon. To enjoy the Sapporo city view, it is better to visit there at sunset or evening."
Night view from above,"We planned to visit here at night. So we can see the view. Its very cold during winter. Normally, snow falls after it rains there."
Winter in Japan 2019,Mt Moiwa is a must visit place if you go to Sapporo. Ring the bell and enjoy the view of the Sapporo.
Mount Moiwa Winter,Its pretty cold but the view is worth more than the cold and we went there when it is opened in the morning so the sky is blue and we can see sapporo very beautifully in a picture
Chilly night and average views,Went with my family on recommendation.  The observatory is open air and it was a chilly night for us. Everyone shuddered a bit while waiting patiently for their turn to ring the bell.  The views are OK but not extraordinary spectacular. Everyone went for the hot drinks once in door. Tip: There are express bus covered by JR pass to and from Sapporo station.
Nice view,Read about this place and decided to try it since it was not too far from our hotel. Took street car then free shuttle bus to the ropeway station. Paid ¥1700 per person for return trip for ropeway and mini cable car. The weather was cold and windy. But the view was fantastic. The cable car was very steady. Feel safe when riding it. From the top we can see the city view. Nice experience and we reached there around 5pm and already dark. Lucky me!
Nice view from the top at night,"There is not a whole lot to do at the top, and it's purely for the view that you go up there. Ideally at night as at daytime it's average."
Breathtaking,"Japan is surrounded by mountains and we chose to visit Mount Moiwa.  It is easy to get to by tram.  From the tram station it is a bit of a walk uphill to the entrance.  We went in the late afternoon in hope to catch the day and night scene from the top.  We were not disappointed.  The cable car ride up offers a magnificent view of the mountain side and the city of Hokkaido.  You can get off at the first station and walk the remaining distance to the top but we decided to go all the way up.  The view of Sapporo at the top was breathtaking.  The mountain is only 539mtrs high but the view and experience at the top was absolutely breathtaking for me. On the way up I saw a cemetery at the side of the mountain, a peaceful and beautiful final resting place for sure."
Nice night view,"We came here in the winter and the hiking path was closed, otherwise a hiking would be great. The night view was spectacular but there's not much else."
"Nice view, long wait","The views of the city at night were very impressive, the place was crowded, so the wait was pretty long."
Didn't have a good view when I was there (2nd week Dec 2019),"They have a live cam installed at the top of the hill where you can preview the scenery on a TV screen at reception floor, before you purchase the tickets.It was night time on our first visit there. We were hoping to see the magnificent view but unfortunately, there was heavy snow fall. The receptionist pointed at the TV screen and told us there is no view at that time (from the TV screen it was pitch black).He was polite enough to apologize to us, although it was the weather and no one could have done anything about it.We left and visited again a few days later. This time in the afternoon. The weather was fairly good, but still not clear enough. Went up all the same but didn't have a good view of the city.There isn't much to do there at the top, really. If you're going just for the view, I suppose 30 minutes would be more than enough.Make sure the sky is 110% clear on your visit, or you'll be disappointed."
Nice view of Sapporo,"Suggest going here at night as the sight of the city is amazing. However, it is very cold during wintertime so be prepared."
Lovely Visit,"We took the cable up to the highest point.So tranquil, so beautiful, so well organised.The journey entailed a funicular and a cable car which was a lovely adventure in itself.Once at the top we were presented with wonderful views, clean air and a perfect view of the surrounding area way past Sapporo.There's a Buddhist Temple at the top too.All a great experience.There's a cafe and restaurant too along with a gift shop.All perfect.."
Amazing view ,It’s easy to access via trains and they have free shuttle from nearest trains stop .  You take cable car up then transfer to train style.  The view is spectacular.  Even in winter or when it’s overcast. Day or night this is worth the trip it’s a nice 2 hour adventure.
Check the weather before heading to Mt Moiwa!,"The views are astounding, yes... but provided you can see them.We were in Sapporo for a period of 5 days, but unfortunately when I checked their weather app, it seemed that there was dense fog almost everyday while we were there. Nevertheless we made a trip up - we did see the day view and catch a bit of the sunset, but while we were waiting for the night view, dense fog suddenly hit us.  I see the warning alert on the weather app about this dense fog and it looked like it's going to stay, so we cut short our stay at Mt Moiwa and made our way down.  There are quite a lot of visitors who didn't know about the fog (they can't see the fog from below) until they went to the ropeway ticket counter and almost bought the tickets, and that's when they saw the ""real time TV"" that nothing can be seen even if they head up the mountain.By the way, you can get nice sunset views and photos on the other side of the observation deck (where there wasn't that many tourists).  And yes, it is extremely cold.  Come prepared with your windproof shell and windproof gloves."
Mt Moiwa Nov 2019,This place is a must visit for everyone that comes to Sapporo.The wind is really strong during this time and freezing my hands haha ! Come here either by bus or JR train is fine.We got on a direct bus from Sapporo bus terminal bus stop #9 (operated by Hokkaido budget Bus pass) for free since we purchased the bus pass before arriving in Hokkaido.
Ropeway then Mt Moiwa,"It’s a bit of a hassle to get there - tram to free bus to cable car then funicular. The views, though, are pretty wonderful. You get a 360 around including both the city as well as nearby mountains. If you have the time and like being outdoors this is a good choice. Sapporo doesn’t have a lot to offer if you don’t have a car."
great views night and day,Easy access and the best views of Sapporo from the peak. doubles as a ski resort in winter. dress warmly as it gets pretty windy at the top
One of the Most Beautiful Nightscapes of Japan,The best place to get a bird's eye view of the city and surrounding area. Not a good place to see sunset at it is blocked by huge antenna but the city view is surely one of the best. I visited in summer and it got a little chilly due to very strong wind. So bring a jacket. The place will get crowded closer to sunset so be mindful when going back down to the city as it will take some time to board the ropeway.
Worth it,Definitely worth a visit . Easy to get to and spectacular views.streetcar and then free shuttle bus. Check weather and go on a clear day
Worth a trip especially at night ,If the queues are not ridiculously long then it’s certainly worth a trip up. The views from the top are quite lovely. If there is a long queue to come down from the top it is a manageable walk from the mini cable car down to the first cable car.
Closed,"We went to the ropeway today, thought it strange we couldn’t see any cable cars moving... turns out there was an accident here on Aug 24 and it has been closed since... no word on when it will reopen."
Amazing views of Sapporo,"Absolutely a must-see in Sapporo. Those who have time, might consider a hike up. Otherwise, the cable car is the way to go."
Can't see anything,"We went late June and could not see anything. We went around 6pm, and free shuttle took us up to the station. The staff showed us the live view of Mt. Moiwa - it was so foggy. We came from a city of fog, so this was no surprise for us. It was a chilly summer night in Sapporo (low 60s). Anyways, the staff told us we can ride midway for a lower price. Since riding all the way to the top will cost more and also no view because of the fog. So we did ride up to midway and shopped a little at their gift shop. We were able to roam around outside and on top the roof, but it was just too foggy to see anything. Anyways, my son had fun since he likes riding cable cars up mountains."
Not recommended visit during Winter,I visited Mt. Moiwa during winter and it was disappointed to see fogs and could't see anything during at night. So this activity is not recommended to visit during Winter unless you wanna play ski there.
Mt. Moiwa,"An amazing experience to ring the "" Bell of Happiness"" at Summit Observatory. Much more if you attached a "" Love padlock"" to the fence of "" Bell of Happiness"". Spectacular panoramic view of Sapporo City from Summit."
Great view,"Japanese towns usually have one viewpoint on top of their biggest hills and Mt Moiwa is special in that it has two sections to it, the second half being with special half size cable cars that allow more people to see the nature around them than the normal ones. That said, we did go after dark and didn't actually see anything. However, we enjoyed the view, especially when we saw clouds rolling over Sapporo beneath us. The Lover's point bell is pretty strange but we gave it a ring anyway! There are the obligatory fences you can attach locks to as well if that is what you are into. The price is fine in terms of how much this type of attraction usually is."
Night view of Sapporo,"Everything is made accessible, from street cars, to the shuttle bus to the ropeway and cable car going up the peak. A stunning view of Sapporon"
Stunning view,"Getting to My Moiwa was a breeze. Alighting from Ropeway Iriguchi street car stop is a 3-min walk to the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. However, in winter, waiting for the bus could be challenge with little protection from the wind. Summer on the other hand was nice. Most of the tour groups were there for the night view but being there earlier before the sun sets is far more stunning. Twilight in summer is best as the clear skies offers a clear view of the mountain on the West. The same can't be said for winter twilight as hazy and cloudy skies obscured this same view. I was glad to have been there in both seasons."
Day visit to the mountain near Sapporo,"Drove up to the mountain - mid point, before walking up the remaining 200 m. It is 660 Yen for the toll.It was extremely difficult to find the entrance, maybe I was searching for the wrong place. Only found the toll highway leading up to the mid-point on my third attempt, leaving little time to enjoy the view.Decided to walk up the remaining distance as it was supposed to be 200 m. It was exhausting for my family, as we are not the outdoor type. But the locals were moving up the same path relatively fast and with ease.Walked down from the summit using the 500 m (less physical demanding) as we were quite tired and it was dangerous to use the shorter route.There were signs to discourage using of the paths at night, in view of safety.It was not too crowded during the visit at just before noon.Would consider the night visit in the next visit."
Spectacular night view worthy of the effort and time,"Boasts of a spectacular night view of the city.  Going up with the 2 cable car rides is relatively quick even as we went in mid June 2019.  There is a souvenir store but most visitors did not linger there. The cafe was closed when we were there at around 9 pm.  Coming down took longer as there was a queue of people waiting for the cable cars. The view of worth the effort to go. The guide inside the cable cars only spoke in Japanese so we didn’t know what she was saying.I reckon we took around 2 hrs in all going up and coming down, even if we didn’t linger longer than 20 mins at the top due to all the waiting time taken."
Great night views!,My finance and I had a great time here. It was one of the coldest spots we visited during the closing of winter season. Really cold! my fiance didn't like the cold so much so she mostly stayed inside to absorb some here. But the views here are great as you get to see a 360 view of the city!
Beautiful scenery ,Beautiful scenery but long waiting for boarding ropeway. Went there about 8pm but nothing much to eat.
Excellent Sapporo City view at night,enjoy the beautiful scenery of Sapporo city at night..didn't know how big is Sapporo until we went up here
Better to visit at night,"If you have not experienced riding up a hilltop in an aerial ropeway cable car, this is the place to try it. If you have had that experience before, this is nothing new. In daytime, the view from the top is just commonplace. Nothing special. To make the trip worthwhile, it is better to come at night. The sight of Sapporo in lights offer a much better view. Better still, come at late afternoon to enjoy the beautiful sunset at the hilltop."
Beautiful View.  BYO Food and Drinks,"Excellent views from the top.  Highlight of Sapporo.  Take the Mt Moiwa Ropeway.  But don’t expect to have a drink at the bar as you wait for sunset. Pretentious expensive restaurant has the best views, but no bar.  Best to BYO."
Stunning view,"Despite the super long queue & cold weather when I visited, I enjoyed riding on the cable cars and the night view of sapporo is really pretty.."
Skip the insane rush!,"Decided to do this in the late afternoon so I could see the sunset + night view. A definite recommendation but really start early! And don't stay too late!I was there during the Golden Week holidays in Japan and it was loaded with tourists. Loaded like the lines to go in at 7 PM for the night view were running at least an hour waiting.I left Sapporo -Odori area by the mini-tram around 430 PM. Get off at Ropeway Iriguchi station. You can pay in the tram with your IC/Passmo card. There is a shuttle bus to take you to the rope way station. If you can walk, it's a 15 min quick walk. Skip the bus. You have to wait some.There will be two cable cars to take you up to the top. One takes you to the base, the next one takes you to the top. I got there at 530 pm, saw the sun set which was by about 630-645 pm and I started to head back at 7 pm. By this time the rush was MANIC to see the night view.The sunset is amazing on the other side of the same viewing platform with no people to push you around or cameras in your face. At 7 pm, on the way down in a not so crowded cable car you will see a pretty fantastic view of Sapporo un-hindered by the crowds. And to me this is worth it than standing in lines to first go up and then stand in unending lines to then come down...do the smart thing ;)At the top you have:  - vending machines - toilets - a small cafe for snacks and coffee - a restaurant"
Worth doing during the day too!,"We went up Mt Moiwa during the day in late March when there was still snow on the ground. There is a free shuttle bus from the bottom of the hill (near the tram stop) to where you pick up the cable car. It's only a short journey, but it's steep! The ticket, round trip, to the top of the mountain and back was about 1700yen if I remember correctly. It takes two cable cars - one to take you to the halfway point, where there's a giftshop, and then another car to take you to the top (where there's a viewing observatory and cafe). The giftshop sells all sorts of cool local gifts we weren't able to find elsewhere, so it's worth a browse. And the cafe does good hot chocolate! The view from the top is spectacular, especially if you get it when the sun comes out. You can see the whole city, plus the dramatic range of hills and mountains surrounding you. We had a great time visiting, plus it was cool to ride the cable car. Well worth a visit!"
Snowy fun,"Despite low visibility, we went up Mt Moiwa. Instead of a magnificent view, we were treated with great snowy fun. The lunch at the restaurant was also great!"
Great night view!,"I'm not overly keen on views, but my wife pulled me here and it was worth it.  Fantastic view and great atmosphere!  Its a little pricey and we had to queue for a bit for the tram down.  Still, a nice romantic stop."
Too many visitors on Sunday,"The city view is very nice but too many visitors on Sunday night. They were packed in like sardines in cable car, cannot move. Recommend to arrive 4-5 pm so that can see day and night versions of city view. I arrived at night and it's too difficult to take nice photo due to no light"
Magnificent night view of Sapporo,"Go to Mt. Moiwa for one of the best night views that you can get in Sapporo. Would recommend you to take a taxi there if you stay near to Sapporo station. It is much more convenient and doesn't cost too much. The ropeway and cable car towards the summit tends to get crowded, but it'll be fine once you reach the top."
Pristine snow in winter and a stunning view of Sapporo - perfect experience to share with friends.,"Our group of four went there just as it opened in winter at 11am.  Getting the tram from Sapporo, there's a complementary shuttle service to the rope-way a 50m walk from the stop which I would highly recommend taking advantage of in winter.  In summer I assume the walk to the ropeway (10-15mins) would be a nice stroll, however in winter the ice can cause some problems while hiking up to the entrance.After purchasing our tickets, we entered the gondola and proceeded up the mountain.  I was on the look out for any wild animals in the snow below (I didn't see any), but still took the time to appreciate the spectacular views as we went up the mountain.  When we reached the top it was quite clear we were amongst the first to reach the summit as the snow was untouched. We quickly went about changing that, throwing snowballs and making snow angels in the powder.  From there we wandered around, went to the 'lovers tower' (though none of us were coupled up) and walked around the small shrine-like structure.  You can also do walks from the top, however our group was not equipped for it.It was quite cloudy when we went up, so we didn't get the views from the top.  When you purchase your tickets below there is a current visibility rating so we knew this would be the case.  It was still worth the time to go up to the top, and the views available on the gondola ride were a great consolation.The restaurant/kiosk opens around 1pm, however if you want a warm drink there is a vending machine inside.  You can also pack your own food and eat in the rest area below the restaurant which offers floor to ceiling views out into the snow.Before leaving I bought a few cute souvenirs from the gift shop, then it was back out into the city.  We spent roughly two hours up the top taking photos and horsing around."
Beautiful view of Saporro!!,I went there on a winter and and everything was so white and pristine...  Beautiful place!  You go up and down Mt Moiwa in a cable car.  There's even a free shuttle service that takes you to the take off point.   You shouldn't miss this place..
Best view of Sapporo,Great view of Sapporo. We gladly paid to use the ropeway and the rail car to go to the top of the mountain. The star projection in the little movie theater at the top of the mountain is not really interesting for people who don't understand Japanese.
The Bell of Happiness!,"With a big family in tow, it was quite a struggle to go up to Mt. Moiwa. There were several transfers before reaching the place but it was worth it! It might not be as high up as the mountains we went up to in Switzerland with cable cars, but Mt. Moiwa has its own charm. Before going up, there was a monitor where you can see the conditions at the top, for you to decide if you wanted to go with not so clear views because of winter weather. It was cloudy when we reached there but hey, we didn’t travel all the way there just to be deterred by a few clouds. And so up we went, and reached the top, and rang the bell of happiness!"
Amazing place with amazon msg view of the city,"The place offers you an amazing view of Sapporo city and Ishikari bay.  I visited the place in January with my family .you can enjoy the perfect view in the evening time . Situated in the heart of the city , it is very convenient place to visit with family ( small kids). You can go up to top of the mountain by rope way . Night view is amazing ."
Great for Children,"Last December 18 my family went to Mt Moiwa, it was an awesome experience, the view was so beautiful, the trip on the way itself was a beautiful experience. We rode the tramp for the first time, The driver was so polite and kind to us. After the tramp we took the free shuttle bus to the cable station. There are 2 rides to the top. The view was breathtaking, not only on top but also on the way. On our way down they have a wide open for children to enjoy snow. If you have children take the time to go there."
Beautiful night view.,"We visited on Dec 26th, taking a  taxi from Okurayama Ski Jump. It was a short 6km ride costing approximately 1500yen for 4 of us.We left OSJ around 4.30pm, timing it such that we would get to Mt.Moiwa when it was dark. We read that the night views, because of the city lights were beautiful.The ride on the ropeway and cable car was orderly and packed but offered lovely views of the city. It was extremely cold in the open areas and there is a Cafe at midpoint whe you could enjoy hot drinks, snacks and the view. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole exerience."
Beautiful scenery ,The views from the top was fantastic.  Worth going up for the views. Taking the cable car up the top was a great ride. The usher bow to u when U are getting out of your cable car. That's the respect you get .. the feeling was great.Will go back again..
Good view of Sapporo,"It is a nice spot to enjoy Sapporo citylights. Just be aware that during winter, the view are often blocked by blizzard. JPY 1700 for roundtrip cable car ride."
Scenic view of Sapporo!,I personally like the ropeway and the view at the summit. It was breathtakingly beautiful and we were playing with a lot of snow at the summit. Great fun overall!
Night view of Sapporo city,Windy and cold during winter. It also depends on luck. Sometimes there are snow or fog blocking. See the photo attached to have a idea. Download vouchers to get some discount.
Nothing to shout about.,"Learn from my bad experience going to Mt Moiwa in the cold Dec month at night. Paid ¥1700 all the way to the top only to witness spots of lights among the vast darkness in sub zero temperature and strong wind blowing in your face. Would rather do something else more meaningful but if you got lots of time to waste or money to spend, Mt Moiwa welcomes you!"
Things to do at night ,"Free shuttle bus from the streetbus (tram) station Ropeway Iriguchi. Also a good opportunity to try other local restaurants in the neighborhood away from the usual tourist areas like Sapporo train station, Odori or Susukino. Mount Moiwa is a very popular tourist spot, even among the Japanese domestic tourists.  Nonetheless, all the queues are only 10~15 minutes and always in order. There is a restaurant on the mountain called Jewel but it closes at around 9pm, last order is 8 or 830pm. Price for two legs round trip to the middle and top of the mountain, total ride less than 8min, costs about Jpy 1700. I wouldn't say the Sapporo nightview is absolutely breathtaking but it is still a nice thing to do at night."
Visit Mt Moiwa for a gorgeous night view of Sapporo,"We visited Mt Moiwa on our first night in Sapporo. We decided to go there at night so we could view the bright city lights. We visited on an autumn night and it was pretty chilly so if you're doing the same thing,be sure to dress warmly. We took as many photos as we can, rang the bell (which was all lit up at night) then went back down to buy some stuff at the souvenir shop. While we didn't spend a lot of time in this place,I would still say that it was worth the visit."
Nice view for Sapporo City,Mount Moiwa offers great views of the Sapporo city. Went during the winter and the weather was so cold compare to other places. Only take half day/quarter day trip here.I went around 6pm and back around 9pm.The ride up and down on the ropeway was also enjoyable. Free shuttle bus are provided 
Nice view of Sapporo City,"There is free shuttle bus near tram station to ropeway entrance. In the tram, there are leaflets stand which provides tram map and roapway discount coupons which will save your roapway fee 200 yen per person."
Sapporo Under Your Nose,"Mt. Moiwa boasts the best spot to view the city of Sapporo, and it did draw lots of people even on a rainy, humid August night. As you might have already learned, you need to take two different gondolas to get to the top. As the gondola sent us upward, the nightly cityscape slowly and elegantly came into view, despite the annoyingly unstoppable rain. Reaching the top, well, the expected sense of excitement did not kick in. I guess it's again because of the rain. We didn't stay long as there was no shelter or awning where we could temporarily shun the raindrops. Maybe we should have come during the day time? Some afterthought after all this? The small windfall of riding on the city tram, which was very different from riding the metro. (To get to Mt. Moiwa, you either have to hop on a tram (streetcar), or hire a taxi.)"
Peak is for lovers,"Mt Moiwa can be reached by a cable car. It is one of highest mountains in the Sapporo area.The peak has a bell, which lovers can ring to ensure eternal love, and also attach a padlock to the railing. The view from Mt Moiwa is gratifying. The peak is over 500 metres (1640 feet) above sea level. You can dine at Jewels Restaurant at the peak, make a reservation, it is often booked out. Tram is probably the best way to get to the base of the mountain.is b y tram (streetcar)."
Honestly.....,"Don't really know what the fuss is about...to get there u need to get into a street tram, then get on a shuttle bus, then pay to get on a ropeway (which is basically a cable car) to the middle level, then a transfer to a smaller cable car to get to the summit.You do get a nice view of Sapporo and if you can aim to be there around sunset to catch the sunset and the night lights of Sapporo.It does get pretty cold up there so bring a sweaterthe whole experience will cost around 2100 yen each...including the tram ride...so it's not cheap.."
Nice night view.,Charming night scenery of sapppro. it looks like sea of 🌟.Also they have free shuttle bus. 1st thing should do in sapppro at 🌃!
Not worth the trip,"Cloudy day on visit nearing sunset. The view was nothing wow, ticket to the top was not worth the experience. City view was so-so, everything is so tiny. Might as well skip this and Google sapporo City view instead. Lover's Sanctuary is kinda gimmicky. These are one of the best shots I got."
How to Get There (Using Tram),"Easy way to get there is to take the tram (streetcar). There’s only one tram line and it makes a loop through the city. The Ropeway Iriguchi tram stop where you want to get off is about half way around the loop if you get on where most tourists do: on the street above the Susukino subway stop. So you can’t get on the wrong tram or go the wrong way. Riding the tram is a fun & cheap way to get a tour of the City’s various neighborhoods. The trams run on parallel tracks in opposite directions: some go clockwise around the loop and others go counter-clockwise. At Susukino, there are two separate tram stations, one for each direction, around the corner from each other. The tram stations have a video display that shows the whole loop and where each tram is on the loop in real time, so you can see where the oncoming tram is. If it’s too far away, you can cross the street to get the tram going the other direction. Check how many people are getting on – locals use the tram for commuting so, for example, in the afternoon the trams going counter-clockwise are much more crowded than the ones going clockwise from the Susukino station. Like buses, you get on in the middle of the tram and exit out the front door, paying at the farebox as you leave. Fare is a flat ¥200 for adults no matter how far you go. It’s best if you have an IC commuter card so you can pay by touch instead of fumbling for coins. At the Ropeway Iriguchi station, the free shuttle bus is diagonally across the intersection. You can’t miss it because there’s an obvious bus turnout there and anyway half the passengers on the tram will be walking there. Most people ride the bus even though the Ropeway is only a few blocks away, because it is steeply uphill. Getting on the cable car, go to the back of the car since as the car travels up the mountain the views of the city are in the back. Up front, all you see are trees. Once at the top, my tip is to buy the roasted potato cheese stick. Looks like a roasted popsicle made of mashed potato. It’s one of those simple hot snacks that are unbelievably good. So good I had to buy a second one."
Great views and good hiking,"We hiked up this mountain, using directions provided from an internet search. The hike up took us slightly more than an hour on a well-marked and we'll-travelled trail, past many Buddhist statues and local residents also hiking. The trail was slightly muddy due to recent rain. At the top there is a building with viewing platform and lounges as well as a snack bar and gift shop. A Buddhist shrine is also at the top. Since rain started while we were there, we took the incline/cable car down. All of Sapporo can be seen from the top. Although we were there during daylight, it is supposed to be one of the best views in Japan at night."
Great Morning Hike,"So you can take the cable car if you want to, but I went with a group of people hiking up the trail.  The trail is super well maintained and should be doable for all ages as long as you're physically fit enough to hike uphill.  The top is a very beautiful view.  I went in the morning, but the night view is famous.  If hiking isn't your thing, there is a cable car that goes straight up to the top.Try to time it where you're not there at the same time as a tour group/bus, though."
Waste of time,View from top is not that good. It is partially obscured by forest on the mountain. I would prefer mount Hakodate instead.
"Great view of the city, very crowdrd","Went here on a weekday afternoon and the place was PACKED! The cable car ride up wasn't too pleasant as we had to squeeze with many other tourists, although they run frequent enough that we could have waited for the next one (but who knows if it would be the same).Great views of the city, spent probably around 40 minutes at the top enjoying the views and breeze."
Great city mountain,"I did a hike up to the summit (great view of the city!) There are 5 routes to the summit (google it for more information) but I went up via the route from the Jodoshukanon Temple (starting from Kanonji Parking lot on google map)It is quite a short hike, took about 2 hours round trip. There are signs regarding bear sightings so you might need your bear bells."
Great View of Sapporo,"I brought my two sons and my daughter-in-law to Sapporo for a few days in July and we planned on going to Mt. Moiwa on July 14th. However, the rainy weather forced us to cancel those plans because the cloud cover was very bad on that day and the weather forced us to go underground for that day.The weather was great on July 18th and we made to Mt. Moiwa at 10:30 in the morning. We were in the first car up the hill, and the view was real nice. You don't realize how big Sapproro is until you see it fro the top of Mt. Moiwa. The city just unfolds below you and you can see it just spread out before you. Just a great view.The ropeway and cogged cable car ride are really cool. On the way down on the ropeway, I was able to sit in the front and got some really cool videos of the descent to the main station. A really good trip with some really good views of the city."
Amazing view,MT. Moiwa makes it possible to appreciate the extent and beauty of Sapporo City area. It is best accessed by car and then the Gondula. There is food and gift shop with wrapping service but best of all is ringing the bell to celebrate your arrival or any thing else you wish to “crow” about!
"Excellent views of the city, but it can get cold and windy up there.","I'm glad we took this little side adventure.  Mount Moiwa offers great views of the entire city.  It was windy and cold on our visit to the top, but that probably kept the crowd sizes down.  Actually, there weren't many people there at all.  There's a little café area at the upper station where it seemed that most people (like us) brought our own food.  The ride up and down on the ropeway was also enjoyable.  It's a good half day/quarter day activity."
Great city views,Use the circular city tram to get there. If you are romantic couple buy the padlock at midway station (or bring your own) to put on the roof thingy shown in the picture.
Not too bad,Very simple attraction with very friendly staff. You get a nice view of the city and there is a restaurant to dine at if you want. Do it if you are bored.
On a foggy day,We visited the place on a foggy day. It wast difficult to find and there is a free shuttle bus service from the bus stop to the cable car stn (return trip too). The person selling the ropeway tickets advised us abt the poor visibility but we still bought the tickets. At the peak we could see little but we were entertained by a group of acapela singers. The trip wasnt so bad after all.
Beautiful,"I didn't know night view of Mt. Moiwa is top three night scenic view in Japan. You can see 360 degrees from the peak. 1.9 milion people living city light is shining beautifully. Top of the montain is windy. You need to bring a jacket even the temperature is over 20 degrees. There is a planetalium every 30 min. If you want to see it, you need to check the time when you alive."
Go after dark,"To avoid too many people we went to the top before sun set. Unfortunately, the weather was not with us and it was windy and raining. The shuttle bus from the tram station is relatively small so it will not be able to cope with large input of guests. The day view from the mountain was ok. A restaurant is present but was closed during our visit in the afternoon. There was not many seats so after seeing all the views from different angle we decided to retreat from the top to go somewhere warmer. I suppose the night view would be better but it will be pack with visitors."
Nice view at the top ,"We drove and took the mini cable car up to the mt moiwa. Need to pay for parking (toll) and also for the mini cable car. We went in the afternoon, it was quite windy. Nice view of Sapporo. We rang the bell of happiness for good blessings. Should have brought a padlock to place it there! There are many snacks at the shop too."
panoramic view,"need to take two times of cable car to reach the hill top. good panoramic view of Sapporo city. was told it""s beautiful at night."
City Views,Well worth a visit - Mt Moiwa is easy accessible via streetcar then courtesy shuttle bus to the lower Ropeway (Cablecar) station. Spectacular views over Sapporo.
Nice view,"Me & my friends went there on January arround 8pm, we took the tram & free shuttle. When we finally on the top, the weather was soooooooooooo cold & snowy. We only there for like 5mins to saw the view and took picture, then we went back inside. Beautiful view... but not necessary/mandatory place if you don't have time."
Sunset worthy spot,"Sunset worthy spot, but however, after sunset hours, the cable car to go down will take 1-2 hours. There is a total of 2 cabins and limited pax going up and down. Be prepared to wait."
The highest place in Sapporo city for sightseeing,"Very easy to find this place, take sapporo tram street car, stop at Iriguci rope way stop,free shuttle bus waits you and take to the front gate of Ropeway station."
Nightime beauty,Took a trip here at night and was able to see the whole of Sapporo spread out in front of us. Amazing sight.
"Nice view, convenient access from Sapporo","The reason why you should go to the top of Mt. Moiwa is that there is not really any reason why you should not. Not every city has a ropeway up a hill from which you can get a great view, but Sapporo does. So why not go up there and enjoy the view?It is very convenient to get to the top and not too expensive either. You can take the shuttle bus from the tram station, but it is really only a short walk. The ropeway and cable car is a nice ride. There is friendly staff in uniform everywhere who bow and show you where to go.Up at the top you get a reasonably impressive view of the city and the surrounding mountains. There is even a vending machine where you can get a hot coffee to warm up your hands if they are freezing from taking all the photos. You can buy souvenirs with the cute Mt. Moiwa mascot at the middle station, but they seem overpriced."
What a view!,Although it was hazy the view was stunning and well worth the trip to the top. Of course had to ring the bell for many many years of love!
Not a very special night scene,"We were attracted by the advertisement for the beautiful night scenery from the peak (the one with the bell). The bell looks beautiful particularly at night, but we just cannot manage to take any photos with the same angle as the advertisement. What we can capture in the photo is either the night scene or the bell. As for the night scene, it is so so compared to the one in Hakodate. If you have limited time and will only spend one night for night scenery, go for the one is Hakodate."
"good view,   amazing lines to wait","I am not sure if it's worth the 5 minute view to have to spend a good two hours round trip for that. the lines -when the weather is decent and there is actually something to see- are CRAZY. you spend 5 minutes at the top because it's amazingly cold ( I visited in May) and you have several bottlenecks all the way up and down. they either have to add more ropeways or something else because this does not make sense. Be prepared, patient to wait and queue again and again and again and again. Before entering the building, before buying the tickets. after buying the tickets, before going in to the first ropeway after leaving the first ropeway, before going in to the second, after the second, before climbing the stairs to reach the final destinations.... and again on the return....CRAZY"
"Wow, Mermerizing Experience!","Great experience ascending/descending the mountain using the cable car, beautiful view from the top, must go places when you are in Sapporo."
Very worthwhile going up there -,"If your time schedule allows, do not miss this tourist attraction. You can get there by tram and a free shuttle bus. Overlooking the city of Sapporo, by day or night is spectacular. Don't miss it!"
Highlight of our Japan trip,"I always wanted to visit Sapporo, Hokkaido for their cute food and beer even though I dont drink. Some people say that they have good parks.So I prepared for parks itinerary while in Sapporo. But when I touched down Sapporo last week, I read review that Mt. Moiwa is one of best three night views in Hokkaido.I used google to give direction to go to Mt. Moiwa, suggested as follow: From Nishi Juitchome subway, we needed to go out from subway station and found for tram to go to Chuotoshokan-Mae stop and walked to ropeway station for 15 mins (The walking road was nice but it was uphill). BUT it was wrong.One stop before Chuotoshokan-Mae, there was Ropeway Iriguchi (which I saw it but I thought it was for another ropeway, -my bad) and from that stop we only needed to cross the street to find FREE shuttle bus to go up to Mt. Moiwa ropeway station. We found that correct route and way after we went back walking down to tramp stop station (this time to ropeway Iriguchi) and saw that free shuttle bus stop.Actually it has been written by some bloggers but since I didn't prepare for Mt. Moiwa, I did miss it.I felt sorry for my mom to experience uphill walking in windy and cold. Ok, so from Mt. Moiwa ropeway, we bought ropeway ticket return Yen 1.100. Once you  were in ropeway you need to go to left side so you can see beautiful Sapporo night city view from above. The ropeway stop at Midway station and we countinued by bus to go to observatory of Mt. Moiwa. The view from ropeway was beautiful but the view from the observatory was breathtaking and sooo windy and cold. We even couldn't dare to stay longer for taking pictures. It is indeed one of one of best three night views in Hokkaido.Our time in Sapporo, Hokkaido was so limited and now I'm so looking forward to have chance to go back to Hokkaido.The park was nice and I can imagine myself in future at that park for cherry blossom."
Shuttle Bus to Mt Moiwa,It's a must write for me on the early part of the Mt. Moiwa trip. We slighted at the station of Ropeway Iriguchi to take the free shuttle bus to the ropeway. The attendant there is more than fantastic. 10mins of waiting time he was polite and courteous and friendly. To every passerby he will greet them like any visitor. I'm super impressed being someone in the hospitality industry. Thumbs upx3
Mt Moiwa,"This place is a must see regardless of crowd.  We went there in early October. Do bring warm clothes because it is cold and windy up there. We took the street car (tram) from Susukino to Ropeway Iriguchi station (170 yen). From there there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the lower ropeway station, or you can walk the way (not very far). Then you take the Ropeway to the top (1700 yen roundtrip with mini cable car). This is the one I would suggest especially if you intend to go at night, so you don't have to walk down.  It opens from 10:30am to 10 pm and from 12pm to 10pm (winter). You can find all the details in English on their website. The view over Sapporo is amazing... and if you go around sunset, even better...which we did.  It was really windy and cold but we loved the view and felt it was all worth it.They have signs on their walking path to be aware of bears!!! hence the ropeway!  They also have a restaurant and some souvenir shops.Check their website for maintenance time when service is suspended!"
Lovely night views,"Wasnt that easy to find the route up considering its one of the main tourist attractions. There were no signage of directions from the nearest streetcar stop (Denshajigyosho-Mae).  However, once you've braved the 15 minutes trek to the ropeway building, it's a nice ride up to the summit.  We went at 7 pm, so we missed the day time crowd and the after dinner crowd. The night views are very nice on a clear night.  In mid April, there's still some snow from midway up.There's a bell you can ring at the summit... For fun 😄1.5 hours is more than sufficient for this attraction."
Incredible and highly recommended!,"We visited here at night right after the sunset (I wish we could have seen the sunset). It was an incredible experience. Riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain, you could see all of Sapporo with all the buildings and lights. There is so much life in Sapporo! The first ski lift was about 4-5 minutes and then you take another short ride to the very top.You have to pay for the lifts and it is about $6 USD per person for the round trip tickets... well worth the price.Once we got to the very top of the mountain you walk up the stairs to the top floor where you can walk outside and view the whole city. It was incredibly cold when we went and it was also snowing, which was really nice... though the visibility was low. Even with low visibility, it was still an incredible experience. I would like to return for sunrise and sunset one day, if possible.They also have a general store and restaurant inside the building. It is a really nice place and certainly something you should do if you visit Sapporo!"
Good view of the City,Good view of the City. We got special discounted rates by buying from tourist center office in Tanukikoji. =)
Amazing View,"Highley recomeneded, I suggest going up about 30 minutes prior to sunset. The day/night view are both spectacular."
Not suited to hungry novices ,"We chose this ski resort because it was close enough to our hotel in Sapporo to get a taxi there and back in a day, and because we have novice skiers with us, so we didn’t need a more up market resort. The beginners slope is not as well arranged for learners as other ski fields I’ve been to, so not really the best place to start for our novices. Getting a private ski instructor who spoke English was a struggle, though successful and very expensive, and reading most kanji signage was not English tourist friendly either. No snowboards are permitted. We were there on a Monday, and no catering was available, other than vending machine drinks. Then on her last run of the day, the 10 year old novice fell over, yet again, but this time resulting in a spiral fracture of one of her tibias. I never saw the ski patrol folks anywhere other than sitting in their office. I skied her down the slope to the first aid post where little was done. Only found out it was a fracture two days later after our return flight, in an Australian hospital!"
Great Place for Night Views,"I heard of this place through here and I just had to check it out. I went close to 9 pm this past Wednesday night, hoping there would be a smaller crowd. We made it before the last free shuttle and we were rewarded with spectacular views! I recommend a good jacket for this time of year even though it’s not snowing as much because the winds up at the top made it pretty chilly! To get there from Susukino, we took the streetcar to the free shuttle (12 stops), took the shuttle (5 minutes), then took the cable car to the top. It’s definit worth checking out at night!"
Amazing View,"You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape, providing clear, unobstructed views of Sapporo. Next, transfer to the cable car called Mo-risu Car, which brings you to the peak after traveling through the forest. Be sure to check out the views from both the ropeway and cable car. The price is quite expensive but it comparable with the experiences that we had."
Night view of Sapporo city,"One of the rated night view of Japan was indeed beautiful, it snow heavily when I turn dark so I couldn’t take much photos. Crowded with tourist, so be more careful when you are at top."
Amazing Night View Point,Mt.Moiwa can access by street car (tram) and when arrive iruguchi station and continue with the free shutter bus to the cable car centre. On top the Mt.Moiwa we can see the whole Sapporo city view especially the night view are amazing. On top the Mountain the snow scence are very beautiful as well.
Excellent Night View ,"This place is accessible by tram then by shuttle bus to the cable car station. Some activities available to sign up such as the Morisu Express. The cafe up at Mount Moiwa served delicious pastries. Be sure to give them a try. There is also a restaurant but it was fully booked when we went there. The place had an amount of tourists and locals. You can purchase locks at their gift shop for 1000yen. But I recommend you to get locks from your own country or at the 100 yen shop. If you get your own locks, bring your own markers as they only provide markers for people who buy their locks. Recommended to visit around 4pm for day and night view of the city."
Check the weather.,"Unfortunately I didn't manage to go up to this attraction. That is because I went in the middle of Febuary with the initial thought of going to see the snow festival with a few add on things. But if you do wish to go up here as I heard the view is fantastic, then please check the weather. No point in having a wasted journey for nothing!"
Mt.Moiwa The biggest attraction‘‘360 degrees panoramic view’’ in Sapporo!,"The night view from Mt. Moiwa near Sapporo, so beautiful that it has been listed as one of the “three best night views of Hokkaido.Place for lovers.It only takes about 30 minutes from Sapporo station, and is a very important sightseeing spot."
My Moiwa,Visited here toward the end of the day and watch the sun go down. Its gorgeous to watch the lights come on over the city as the place turned dark. Seemed like Christmas in February!
A breathtaking view from the top,"One of the best place to try for foreigners & locals alike. If you happen to be in sapporo city, Don't forget to include this tourist spot on your schedule. You will love the breathtaking view of the whole sapporo city from the top of this mountain. Very accessible from sapporo shiden (tram). There is a free shuttle from Ropeway Iriguchi station that will bring you to the first cable car station."
beautiful view,"We visited this mountain on a cold February evening. The view was spectacular and well worth the trip, but very, very cold. You couldn't stay out long but ringing the bell gave a nice photo opportunity . Cable car was cramped ,but if you were by the window you had a good view. Free shuttle bus and tram ride to the foot of the mountain worked well. Food very disappointing , the restaurant was full and the little counter served hot drinks, a poor range of snacks and no where inside to sit. The few seats there were taken up with people ignoring the view sat on phones. A missed opportunity maybe on the middle section for a better cafe, we would have stayed longer. Fireworks ... Well we had seen a poster and thought there would be fireworks, no mention on line , no other posters , no signs when we arrived so we walked around and headed back down, only to see fireworks from the cable car ,very disappointing, should have been better advertised!"
Amazing views,We took the cable car and rope car to the top of Mt Moiwa. Lots of snow but the views are incredible. Watched the 3D movie which was interesting although it was Japanese which was to be expected of course but still got the gist of it. Had an ice-cream which seems to be the norm in Japan even though its winter.
Nice view from the top,Worth to visit while in SapporoNice view of Sapporo from the top of the mountain A bit cold in the evening
Pretty nice views of Sapporo albeit a little expensive,Those going during winter may want to keep a lookout for the shuttle to the ropeway base station near the streetcar stop instead of walking because it can get really cold trekking up the hill.The views are good up there if you go on a clear day (during winter). We also saw locals ski down from the mid-level station and trek down from the top which is interesting.Why I feel the fee charged is expensive is because there aren't much facilities and this place is rather small so you wouldn't spend much time there and will leave probably after a few pictures.
the view,interesting way to get up to mount moiwa. you have to take the streetcar first then hop on the shuttle bus. finally the ropeway and cable car brings you to the top of the mountain. great view but it can be cold! we went in winter. great way to spend the evening after sunset. most other attractions close before sunset in winter anyway so mount moiwa is a great addition to fill your itinerary.
Mt. Moiwa,It was snowing but the view was great. Fir direction going there local people where so friendly and very accomodating
Enjoy Sapporo's evening scene,Good place in Sapporo city to enjoy the evening.Shuttle bus available in the city center connect with tram.Be sure to go with a warm coat.
A Simply Beautiful & Memorable Place,"A spectacular view of Sapporo City from this mountain. From Susukino, take Sapporo's only streetcar line to ""Ropeway Iriguchi"" station (25 minutes, 170 yen, frequent departures). From there, a free shuttle bus operates to the lower ropeway station (5 minutes, departs every 15 minutes).Try to go when it is sunset to enjoy the evening and night view."
Spectacular views of the bay and mountains,"We went here on a lark before our flight, and were blown away by the spectacular view from the top. The mountains all around Sapporo are beautiful, but the coolest thing was seeing Ishikari Bay spread out below to the west. The map of Hokkaido felt like it had come to life in front of us. The ropeway ride was really fun--we could see a man walking his dog in the snow below us--and I wish we had more time to stay up at the top. We will have to go again for the famous night view. We took the streetcar and walked to the Ropeway, arriving a minute after the free shuttle bus. It is a pleasant uphill walk if you don't want to wait for the bus."
Great place,"I think that it's almost a must visit in Sapporo. The view of the city is spectacular, the facilities on the top are comfortable, and the hike through the park is great (one needs basic gear to take a hike - poles and preferably - spikes, if in the winter)."
Amazing Night Scenery but Too Cold During Autumn/Winter,"Amazing Night Scenery but Too Cold During Autumn/Winter.We visited during December 2017 and though this is Autumn, being on top of such a high mountain made the climb and end destination a freezing experience. We didn't stay at the lookout for too long because of the cold air and wind blowing."
Great visit,"Took the Ropeway going up, definitely worth the trip! You can see the whole Sapporo, plus the great view beyond Sapporo. Stayed here for about two hours, we wanted to take the trail going down back to the main lobby at street level but we weren't wearing any proper trekking gears. Good restaurant at the top, if you have the time and the budget for a really nice meal :-)"
Awesome view ,The climb up the observation deck is beautiful. One can see a panoramic view! Very cild during the winter.
Amazing view!,Took the cable car ride up around 3pm and the  surrounding views were amazing. The sunset & night view from the top was breathtaking! Dine at Jewels restaurant. Fine food & views!
A view out.,"There's the ropeway to a midway station, then a cable car up. You can get tickets to just the midway station, but you can't really see much from there, and there's no dedicated viewing platform. Pay the extra amount to go all the way to the top, and you will be rewarded with a panoramic view over the city. Great to see it and the lights at night. Beware of slippery frost on the ground of the viewing area in cold weather though, and bring warm clothing. It was about 2 degrees C outside when we were there.Also, despite the brochure saying the ropeway cars and cable cars have been designed to give you a great view of the surrounds as you ascend/descend, realistically, you will be packed in with over 20 other people (closer to 30), and unless you're right on the edges, you won't see much."
Awesome night view!,Came here on my birthday and got my cable car and driveway tix for free!!! It's easily accessible.just go to the streetcar stop and sit till Ropeway Iriguchi stop. Costs about 200jpy. Then from there walk to the shuttle bus stop. It's less than five mins walk away. The shuttle bus to Mount Moiwa ropeway is free. You will love the view! The city of Sapporo shines below you in a sea of lights. Worth the ride I say!
beautiful view,"We visited Mt. Moiwa at night and the view was breathtaking.  We were lucky and it was a clear night.  It was cold so bundle up before you go.  You can go by bus, taxi or drive."
"Convenient location, worth taking a look","Quite a child friendly spot although taking the Sapporo tram with a stroller could be a challenge. Went on 20 Oct and the weather wasn't good to grant us a good view of the city. Nonetheless, the ride up on the cable (round trip for adult: 1700 yen) was quite well spent."
Great view,"This is one of the cool places of Sapporo, great view especially during night time. Lighting of the city is amazing. There is some fee's involved  but it's much worth it. 360 degree view awesome."
Best view in the area!,Great view with enough space for everyone to take nice photos. Suggest to help each other to take photos in the middle light structure.
funny photo taking service,there was a photo taking service which provided you a doll character of the hill. It was a cold night with only 8 degree celcius in June! And there was a free shuttle bus service so it was quite convenient to go there. You can go hiking to reach there if your do not want to take the cable car.
 Best views of Sapporo,Definitely a must visit spot with great views of Sapporo. I have been to this place both winter and autumn. Probably better on autumn
A bit of a tourist trap; endless queues for the various cable car stops,"Worth doing in the late afternoons and evenings, since it provides for a good, if not spectacular panorama of the city and its surroundings. Otherwise, it is rather unexciting, and stuck in an area where there is nothing else to do"
Excellent hike but don't go alone!,I hiked by myself in an attempt to catch the sunset view.  I only saw 3 or 4 people on the whole hike and there were warning signs everywhere about bears. I was very worried as I didn't have a bear Bell but I made it! I'd advise getting a bear bell just to have a peace of mind.Lots of people at the top for the sunset and night view. It was definitely worth the hike for sure!
Better than Mt Hakodate,"Sapporo Mount Moiwa This tourist destination is recommended. You may go up the peak either in the day or at night. I think the night view is even better than that of Mt Hakodate. According to the brochure, during the “Nightscape Summit 2015 in Kobe”, Sapporo Mt Moiwa was chosen along with Nagasaki and Kobe as one of the three most beautiful nightscapes of Japan. To take the tram (streetcar) and alight at Ropeway Iriguchi station. Walk along the main road with Mt. Moiwa signboard to the shuttle bus pick up point on the left. The free shuttle bus will ferry you to the ropeway station. If you are a senior above 65 years, there is a discounted ticket available. The ropeway climbs from the base of the mountain to the transfer station. From here, you will be transferred to an unique twin cable cars to the peak. The observatory at the peak offer you spectacular view of Sapporo city. The view is especially beautiful after sunset. Mount Moiwa offers five mountain trails too. The shortest is 2.4 km and you may hike in casual clothing. You may wish to venture into it."
Best views of Sapporo and surrounding areas,"I went hiking up Mt. Moiwa early morning from the Jiekaibyoin Mae Course Parking Lot for a moderate hike that took about one hour to complete.  Once done, I emerged at the observatory on a beautiful sunny day with 360 degree views of the entire area that stretched for miles.  Since I went early, there were few people and it was quiet, which made for a good time of reflection and calm.  On the way down, I decided to take the Ropeway cable car down to Sanroku and a short walk to the tram line.  Overall best views you will find (and if you take the cable car, it is an inexpensive ride with the most calming background music ever)."
"Simply Breathtaking, From Dusk till Dawn",We were lucky as we did not have to wait very long to get up Mt Moiwa (~4.30pm on weekday) and we deliberately plan to get up the Mt before dawn.Knowing the time for sunset will help you plan your trip and you will be able to see both the day & night view.
"A great hike, with incredible views.","Do it properly and hike up. It's not a particularly long or hard climb (an hour up at most), and makes the views at the top even better. I went up the mountain the day after I went up the JR T38 tower. and the views over the city are even better! with the bonus of being able to see the countryside beyond the city."
Such a great view,We visited the mountain in the evening which was a very great idea. At the first the lines were long but when we reached the summit we released why this is such a big tourist attraction. The views were magnificent. Looking over Sapporo city during the evening is definitely one of the highlights of my trip to this fantastic city.It is easily accessible via subway and the street car. I will highly recommend Mt Moiwa to everyone. Must do!!!
Crazy queues on a Sunday night,Not sure if it is always so crowded but I waited 2 hours for a 10-20 mins view at the top of Mt. Moiwa. The morriscar and ropeway was packed with people. The night scenery was good but marred by the crowd. Recommend to go before sunset and stay till darkness falls for a much more enjoyable experience. Else you will miss the chance to go to the gift shop as they close at 9.30pm.Download the Sapporo Info app for discounts!
Nice view,"The view is nice but it is not easily accessible if tourists do not rent a car for the trip. Even at a summer night, it is quite cool there."
Lovely view of sapporo,Awesome view from top of mountain. You may came late at afternoonand stay until dark to have a sparkling night view. Easily access from susukino by tram. They providw love lock pad pad too.
Good way to spend half a day,"We did this on our last full day in Sapporo, a very clear and sunny day in July. We took the streetcar from Odori park and used the free shuttle. We paid the one way to go all the way to the top and walked down. The view up there was amazing. One can easily imagine how cool it would be at dust and at night. If I do this again I would recommend taking the cable car to the middle section (return), and just walk the last little bit up and down yourself as that part is very short. On our walk down we took a wrong turn and ended up in a rather remote area, and it was another 30 minutes before we found civilisation!"
Good view of city,Nice view over the city from top of MT Moiwa. Recommend to go there in the evening . Go there by bus and ropeway
Superb night view,We took the cable car around sunset time and the view was great! It was the night when a number of places were having firework. A unique experience to be able to see the full moon and firework together with the Sapporo night view all at the same time!
Best choice for winter travel!,I went there in winter and I can see a lot of snow covered the mountain and city! Beautiful place for night view too.
Incredibly View of Sapporo at Night,"Amazing view of Sapporo at night.  It can get a bit congested with tourists, but the staff are helpful at moving people along.  There's free parking at the base of the ropeway, and if you're looking for something to do after dinner, I'd strongly recommend a visit."
Breathtaking,"We visited Mt. Moiwa in the late afternoon with the intent of watching the transformation of the day view to the night view.  Public Transportation to the Ropeway is very convenient.  You just need to do a little research on how to get there.  It got a bit chilly, so dress appropriately.  We visited during the summer.  I can't imagine how cold it would be during the other seasons.  The view did not disappoint.  This is a MUST if traveling to Sapporo,"
"Nice place, but have seen better","Went up to Mount Moiwa in the late afternoon. If you had been to other cities e.g. New York, frankly this view was forgettable. That said, strolling around the park / garden and doing the short trekking nearby was a nice experience."
Good view ,"Went to Mt Moiwa on a lovely clear day. There's a free shuttle bus dropping you off at the cable car entrance near the street car stop. Then need to catch 2 separate cars to get to the top. As they charge separately for the 2 cars, you can decide not to go to the top if you don't want to...but why wouldn't you?The view from the top was great. Apparently it's one of the 3 'new' best night view in Japan. Oops, maybe we should've visited at night."
If you have never done this before it might be fun,A long expensive trip for a view of Sapporo from on high. Maybe we are just jaded but it did not seem worthwhile. Perhaps the restaurant would be nice when it is open on the top.
nice little experience,"Visited on a week day morning with our son who lives and works in Hokkaido. First time up Mt. Moiwa for all of us and we caught the first train at around 10ish I think. Pretty easy to find and park the car (at the time of writing this was free and is located directly opposite the bottom ropeway station). As with virtually everywhere in japan the staff were super friendly staff and couldn't do enough to makes the experience one to remember. The ropeway is in two half's and is a nice little experience, Once at the top the views over Sapporo are amazing but other than that its a bit of a souvenir trap and for the price I'm not entirely sure it is worth it. You can walk up but we were pushed for time."
Nice Views,"No intention of visiting Mt. Moiwa. Just wanted to sit the streetcar. Reminded me of the trams in Milan. But then decided to go after seeing its goes to Mt. Moiwa. A kind lady passenger took a leaflet coupon from the bus and gave it to us. Show it to the ticket counter and you get a discount. The cable car up was nice and the views were very nice too. The winds were very strong up there. We went around 6.30pm and it wasn't crowded at all. Would be nicer if we waited till dark when you can see Sapporo twinkling below. As we came down we could see the ferry wheels lights. Very pretty.,"
Lovely view at the top,"This is like the mountain in the backyard of Sapporo. It offers a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding mountains. You can also chose to hike up fr mid mountain. I saw someone jog up the trek. Either way you do it, we'll worth the efforts and enjoy the view. Tip: the staff at the ropeway at the foot of the mountain have a live camera of the view at the top. Check it first to ensure your views are not affected by bad weather."
Nothing much to see,"Went there during early summer, Took the cable car to go on top.View is nice but nothing much to do.. 1 visit is enough.."
Nice view of the city. ,"I went here during the day and the view of the city was lovely. I can only imagine how beautiful it is at sunset. I took a street tram to the Mt Moiwa shuttle bus stop and then took the free shuttle up to the building. I thought that the tickets for the ropeway and cable car were a bit pricey. At the middle stop, there's a souvenir shop with some cool stuff. There's a lock fence at the summit, like the one in Paris. You can buy the locks and markers for it here. I went during the week so the summit was not crowded. There were mostly older people. I also saw a lot of people in hiking gear so I think it's possible to hike there.  I would like to go back sometime and see the views at sunset or at night."
We were so pleased we made the effort! Good wheelchair access.,"We were in Sapporo in late April and although the weather was warming up there was still a lot of snow around. Coming from a warm area in Australia it was wonderful to visit Mt Moiwa and see it covered in snow on a beautiful sunny clear day (it was still very cold in our standards). The view is spectacular.The gondola/cable cars to get to the top are wheelchair accessible and the viewing platform is also accessible (except to get to the bell).We caught a taxi out to the site as the streetcars used to get out there are not wheelchair accessible, nor are the connecting shuttle buses."
Magic Night Views of Sapporo,"Magic view of the city,  good basic night out although not too many facilities at the top.  Impressive location."
Great views,"Getting here was easy enough they offer a free shuttle bus from Iriguchi stop, which is a street car stop. The bus ride is about 5 minutes to the ropeway station. Then it's up to the 4th floor for tickets. There are 2 tickets one only hoes half way up and the other is to the top. A round trip ticket to the top is 1700yen. Now you can buy a one way ticket for 900yen but I don't know how you would get back down. I think there is a hiking/walking path but I am not sure. Once you reach the top of the ropeway you then have to take a cable car which takes uou to the top of the mountain. From the top it's a great view of the city with all of the lights twinkling from the city. On the way down in between the ropeway and cable car stops is a gift shop where you can putchase items. I would not go during the day and don't know if the high cost would want me not to return."
Amazing cable car ride to Mt.Moiwa,We unfortunately went there on a cloudy day but the flip side was it was not at all crowded and we thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of being amidst clouds. The vending machine has hot cocoa and on top of Mt. Moiwa it was simply heavenly !
1-Hour Hike From Jikei Hospital Trailhead,Ascend the mount by foot to make your trip a little more memorable - that's what I did. Then descend with the ropeway after taking in the city view.
Great views of Sapporo,Go before the sunset and return when it is totally dark. This way you will be able to see the beautiful Sapporo in the day time and enjoy its lights at night time. There is also a restaurant there with nice view so you can have a good quality time with your companions.
Great romantic place to visit for sunset,"The view is great.  We went during the afternoon, so we didn't get to see the bright lights of the Sapporo landscape, which is rated as top 3 in all of Japan.  We recommend a total of 1.5 hours for this trip.  You may have dinner there, but the food is average.  They are selling the view, which you may see at the observatory deck.If you want to save some money and enjoy some hiking, may I suggest getting a one way ticket up to the top and walk your way down, it takes around 30 minutes at a leisurely pace and soaking in the landscape.Ring the bell, just remember to cover your ears.  With my height, my head was right next to the bell, which leaves ringing for some time."
May better going there at night,"I'm going there at noon during the cloudy day, so nothing much to see. I suggest to go there at night so you can see the view better, but it depends on the weather."
Surprisingly good,Was expecting it to be a bit underwhelming but well worth the trip. Straight up and down in 45 mins from the Base station. DON'T GO EARLY. The first car up is at 10.30 am.
Minimal views at the top on a foggy day,"We came here on a cold day, got to the desk to buy tickets and was so sad when we were told that the views up the top were very foggy and we wouldn't be able to see anything. They have live cam (which it turns out is pretty accurate). We had taken the tram and then the mini bus to get to the rope way thing, so we decided what the hell. We were going up anyway.Even though the views from the top were super foggy (really couldn't see anything), the views of the city as we ascended the mountain were clear and really nice. Even going outside was cold but rather pleasant. Other than the view though, there is not much to do here apart from the shop. I guess my tip is that the live cam is really accurate. The view was pretty much exactly as the camera portrayed it. But you will probably get lovely city views on the way up to the mountain anyway."
Probably not the best time to go during Golden Week holidays...,"As the no 1 thing to do in Hokkaido, we made it a must go item even at 7pm, but after 20 mins just to get to ticketing counter on 2nd floor of the starting point, it was an ominous sign. Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top, the horror descended upon us as the snake of people waiting to get down was like more than an hour long. Didn't help as we were hungry. So while the view is fantastic, the whole experience didn't go down well at all. The whole trip took 2.5 hours which probably would be just over an hour. Be warned."
Not a must visit attraction,"Maybe my opinion is not 100% correct because when I visited there, it's raining and in the winter. The night view of the city was not that good compared to HK."
Went there yesterday morning,Was there previous night but it was already closed by around 9:15pm. Hence went again the morning and it was great view from there.
Holiday ,Nice place to go to get a good view of Sapporo and some of the surrounding mountains. Doesn't hope until 10:30 in the morning. A visit in the evening would probably be better.
Great hike to do on a clear day,"Definitely recommend this hike while in Sapporo. Took us about an hour to go up; slow and steady with no stops.  The same going back down.  The views at the top were fabulous. Could see the Sea of Japan from the top, and heaps of snow capped peaks in the distance.The trailhead isn't from the ropeway!  You need to get off the tram at stop 14. Walk towards the mountain. At the trailhead, there is some public toilets as well as a large three headed Buddha statue. See that and you'll know you've arrived. We had a few snow patches to cross in early May, but nothing too serious.  There is a place at the trailhead to wash your boots when you have finished (stiff brushes provided), which was great.   There are also a few walking poles there, that you can use, then put back when you are finished, if you didn't bring your own.We packed a picnic lunch for the top, which was great."
Mt. Moiwa,Its a must see for everyone who comes to Sapporo its a breathtaking view of the city especially after sunset .
"An Awesome View of Sapporo City, Japan","If you are in Sapporo City, you must take in Mt. Moiwa.......It offers a panoramic view of Sapporo City.  I would suggest you take in a late afternoon visit.  We took the city streetcar & fee shuttle bus to get to the ""mountain top""attraction........suggest you take the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway & cable car to the top.......the is a restaurant at the topand also a gift shop. If you are going in the afternoon, suggest you bring a jacket.  It got a bit chilly but the city lightsscene is Super!"
Full view of the city,"Stayed at Mercure. Took the tram which is located 5 minutes from hotel. Pay 200yen and get off at Ropeway Iriguchi. Get down, turn left and the free shuttle service is located about 100m from the tram station to the location is available.  Cost is 1700 yen for a visit to the top. Take your time and view every stop. The cable car leaves each level every 15 minutes. Not much eateries though but there is a restaurant at one of the cable car stops.The bus also leaves the station every 15 minutes from 1015am and last bus is 10pm."
Bird's eye view of Sapporo from natural landmark,"Instead of going up a tall tower to view the city, this is possibly best option you could get as it allows you to see pretty much the whole Sapporo metro area. My friends and I were actually planning to go up here the night before but since the train arrival was delayed, we couldn't make it. We took the streetcar to Iriguchi Ropeway stop, just a block away there was a bus stop where we took free shuttle service to the base ropeway station. Admission is 1700 yen for adult, this is relatively average compare to the cost of our daily crazy meals. We were told that we might not able to see Sapporo because of the weather condition. Interestingly, despite the slight snow falls we were able to see the view clearly. I highly suggest anyone come at the evening to enjoy the city light views, they have restaurant up there."
The view in good weather would be great especially at night,After a beautiful sunny day in Sapporo the rain set in but with high hopes we caught the streetcar to Mt Moiwa ropeway and a few metres to the left the free shuttle bus was waiting to take passengers up to the ropeway. Disappointingly the clouds had rolled in and there was zero view up on the ropeway. The visit wasn't wasted as at level 4 where tickets are sold there was still a clear view over Sapporo. The ticket seller was honest and told us there was no view.
Great View,A good place to go for a great view of Sapporo.  We went here in the morning and we regret that we didn't go here at night.  Transportation going there is easy - just ride the streetcar.
"A great view, a big hill in the city","I wanted to run up there, but in april, on the north face you need more than just sneakersStill you can walk to the bhuddist temple 15 min upwardsThe 1700 yen are worth the view and at night even better"
Nice & Windy,Went up the Mt. Moiwa by Bus. The night view of Sapporo city is breathtaking. You won't able to capture nice pictures unless with DSLR camera. The is love bell lighted up. I did que up to take picture but not sure the significant of its :)
"A great view of Sapporo, wish we would've went at night","Mt. Moiwa was neat during the day, but I wish we would have went at night to see the monument lit up and the city lights. The funicular ride to the top was fun. You can take a bus from near where the city bus drops you off, but we just walked."
Wonderful ropeway ride with nice view,"Beautiful scenery on the way to the top by ropeway.. Night view of the city so beautiful... If possible, go up before sunset so can have 2 different views of Mt. Moiwa"
Beautiful view,Nice view from the top. Mt Hakodate was too far away so we opted to go Mt moiwa & we were not disappointed. The ticketing staff asked if we have the discount coupon for tickets but we didn't have so we paid the full price. It got very windy & cold in the late afternoon and the view of the city and mountain was spectacular especially when the city lights come on after 6pm.
Excellent night view!,"Definitely worth a visit, we went up at about 18:00 in April, just as the sun was setting.It looked amazing.Its a bit expensive 1700yen for a round trip to the very top, but if you have booked via JTB, you might get a pamphlet full of discount tickets, as we did.With the jtb discount we got tickets for 500 yen round trip, which was a great saving.Very beautiful view, fun ride up on the cable car, should def be on imo your sapporo itinerary :)"
Nice view and ropetow,"Cool place to stop by on an evening in Sapporo. Beautiful view of the landscape, and there's a nice coffee shop and restaurant at the summit."
Beautiful Sapporo City from above,Took Mt. Moiwa ropeway. It was snowing that day.. You can see the whole city of Sapporo from the peak level..
Beautiful views and nice visitor center.,This is definitely worth the cost of admission.  The views are spectacular.  Be sure to arrive in time for sunset and stick around to see the city light up.  Warm up at the visitor center with a beer or hot chocolate.
Amazing view! ,"It is a second attempt for us to go this place. On the first night, we tried to use google map to search Mt. Moiwa and it guided us to go by the expressway (toll road), unfortunately it is blocked till the week after we visit there. The next night we drive to the ropeway station and go up through Sanroku.The view is really amazing. We didnt stay there long as it was really cold. But i think it worths the money and the time we spent."
Stunning views,Worth the trip for the views alone. The beginning of the ropeway is easy to get to from the centre of the city via the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop and the ropeway itself runs every 15 minutes. You get a short talk pointing out famous landmarks on the way up (Japanese only unfortunately) and there are amenities and a restaurant at the top.Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that 1700 yen seemed a bit steep given how short the journey is.
Unforgettable Experience,"Is very easy access by using the Streetcar from Susukino. You will get the free shutter bus at ""Ropeway Iriguchi"" station that take you to the lower ropeway station."
Best night best in sapporo,Clear sky with sunset and full moon view... you defiantly need to visit this place when you at Sapporo else you will regret for life
Disappoint not to have a table at Jewel for dinner,"Went without a reservation for dinner. Nonetheless, the small take out counter settled dinner but it's only sandwich and hot drinks. The view is great and kids had some fun in a snowball battle the same evening. Take the full ride all the way up. Usual price is JPY1.7k but look closer at the Sapporo tram (which you will likely take to get to the base station/free shuttle bus stop to base station) and you will notice discount coupons(less JPY200/adult) for the ride up Mt Moiwa.Layer up, it's windy in winter."
Beautiful view from observation tower,"About 30 minute by the streetcar and another 15 minutes to entrance.  Signage not too good after streetcar.  Interesting ride on ropeway, cable car to tower.  Beautiful view and restaurant offers decent food for very reasonable price. Sledge carriage is an experience too as it feels like Christmas snow ride except no reindeers but tractor. Whole trip from Sapporo and ride and lunch only cost not much more than 4000 yen.  Great value."
Awesome,"It's fabulous up there! I visited there @winter time. Everything was white and so peaceful. The nature surrounding... Allt to explore. I remembered running and lying on the snow. Unforgettable memories. There's a red cart u can drive on (I forgot the fee). It's fun cart.. Must try! Unfortunately my phone broken and I lost the awesome pics that I took over there. Oh yes! At the middle of the cable car transit, u can find a souvenir shop! And u can download Sapporo application on your phone so when u r buying the tickets at the locket there,  u can get discounts and free postcard!!"
Night View,"Wonderful view during the night, especially during cold winter night but please wear thick layers of clothes!"
The best part of my Sapporo trip,"Got lost going to the place as the bus driver did not drop us at the right stop. But when we reached the peak of Mt Moiwa and had our tons of pictures taken, the exhaustian disappeared. The place reminded me of my Switzerland (Zermat trip)."
Worth going,"This viewing deck may not be within central Sapporo, but going here is worth it. The experience going up the mountain via ropeway and tramway is already relaxing and enjoyable. Once you reach the top, you can see Sapporo city from a bird's eye view. This is a must especially during winter when the entire city is snow-capped."
Beautiful Night View!,"Visited Mt. Moiwa in the winter while in Sapporo for the Snow Festival.  Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station.  As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than to walk up to the station.The view from taking the cable car up was great, could see the snow covered roofs of the city buildings. There's a shop at the midstation before taking the morris car to the top.  The night view was stunning on a clear night, full view of the city down below.For those who want to enjoy the view longer and in comfort, there is a fancy restaurant there too."
Super cold in Winter!,"Can't compare with other seasons but its really cold in Winter.  Catch the ropeway for JPN1700. Midstation for the shop and the top station for the views and 3D movie.  Its really beautiful with the whole Sapporo City blanketed with snow.    Nothing much on the top though except the views, the lovers bell, the shrine and watch some keen people doing snow shoeing on the thick snow."
Mt Moiwa in winter,"Went up Mt Moiwa in February 2017. It is freaking cold. However, there are still some Japanese oldies who came up the hiking trail. I respect these people. Not much activities up at the mountain other than observing the city. It would be a nice place to see the city at night but I didn't do that due to the cold. It is cold enough during the day, thank you."
Amazing Night Views of Sapporo City,"The ropeway and cable car rides provides a teaser to the panoramic views of Sapporo. I think the SnowFestival gives the traveller amazing views of the city of lights. Mt Moiwa has a restaurant and a cafe where you can just sip on your hot drink, eat and relax and be simply captivated by Sapporo City and the locals Omotenashi  or their warm hospitality."
Pretty place,"Should go during the time of sunset. Very pretty mountains at the side and when the sun sets the whole of Sapporo lights up, and it is a very beautiful sight."
See the whole of Sapporo,"Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with  two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city. How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign for ropeway parking- or take a free shuttle about 50m from the streetcar. The entrance is labeled and looks like an office building. When we went, the path was icy, and some of it is uphill; not safe for elderly or very young children. How to tickets: Go to the fourth floor via elevator or stairs to the right. You will be deposited in a ticket line. The workers speak English, and you can use a credit card. The cost for round trip tickets on both the doorway and mini cable car was ¥1700 per adult. There were coupons in the Sapporo guide we were given at the airport; alas, we did not know and did. It bring them. How to get to the top: the rope way and mini cable cars leave every 15 minutes. The  first trip takes about 5 minutes, get a view facing down to watch the city unfurl beneath you! Then, you can buy items at the shop, leave for hiking (we did not try it on a February night), or go up the mini cable car. The second trip is just about 2 minutes. Go out the Rooftop observation deck. What to do: Get your picture ringing the bell on top of Sapporo. Look at the pictures indicating key sites in the city and natural landmarks. You can eat at a restaurant at the top (we didn't) and head back down. If you can't get to ant Moiwa and still want to see the city, you can go to observation decks in JR tower near Sapporo station or the clock tower in Odari park. Neither is nearly as high, though."
Must do if you are in Sapporo,Great place to view the city and surroundings. But in winter everything is grey and white.Take the tram or street car to a stop called Ropeway Iruguchi. Once you get off at the stop around 100-150 meters is the shuttle bus that will take you to the base of the cable car station is. To go up the ticket price is 1700 yen.
Splendid View during Winter,"It is best to hop on a streetcar and get off at Ropeway Iriguchi stop for 170 yen (one way). You may purchase a one day pass (Dosanko Pass 310Y) for the streetcar if you are travelling during weekend or holidays for unlimited ride for a day. From Ropeway Irigiuchi, the free shuttle bus to the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway is within walking distance. The free shuttle bus was pretty efficient that we took no time to wait for it during our trip to and fro. Once you reached there, you may take lift up to the ticket counter and we found discount coupon at HIS website prior to our trip.So we get 500 yen of discount and free kairo (hot pack) for roundway trip (1200 yen). On the day we went, the weather was pretty good and sun was shinning brightly but it still cold. Once you reached the top, you can see the whole view of Sapporo. Do take note there is also bell of Happiness and padlock for lovers. Remember to check whether the ropeway is operating or not during the day of your visit to avoid any disappointment. If you wish to see the night view during winter, it is best to go during 16.00 to capture both day and night and also sunset view. You will never want to miss the view here if you have come to Hokkaido. It is one of the best attractions here other than Mt. Hakodate."
Nice night view of Sapporo from hilltop ,It's quite pricey to get up there just to get a night view. Out of curiosity we did that but we won't do that again unlike the hilltop night view form Mt Hakodate which is much more amazing. We got there by street car follow by a free transfer by bus then cable car to the hill top. The drizzle spoilt our enjoyment so we had a glimpse and off we departed for all the trouble to get there.
Amazing view,The best view would be going down the ropeway during sunset where you can have the panoramic of Sapporo city. A must place to visit when in Hokkaido. We just loved the winter view. The kids definitely enjoyed the ropeway rides.
Great view of sapporo in winter,"Get on the streetcar and alight at the Ropeway iriguchi stop. Hint: you can get on at any station as the streetcar goes in a loop, 170 yen flat rate. There's a discount coupon in the streetcar (right behind the driver seat) which entitles you to 1500 yen ticket instead of 1700yen. Great view of sapporo city atop the mountain. Was there on a clear sunny day and managed to catch the sunset. Very cold in January, spent about 1.5 hours atop the hill."
Panoramic Night view ,It is indeed cold once you get up there but the clear views of the city down below distracts you from the cold for a few minutes. After dark it was difficult to see the beauty of the mountains just behind the city views but I reckon at daytime it will be stunning. Night views offer a sprawling lightup of the city below. Tramcars from odori or susukino stop at the Mt Moiwa ropeway tram stop and a shuttle bus next to the tramstop takes u to the ropeway. Easy to get up and down.
Romantic place,"We went there in winter and the whole place was covered with thick snow.  As it was snowing very heavily on the day we went, we actually couldn't see any view.  But the place just looked so romantic in snow."
Great views,"A good short day trip for a fantastic view of the city . In winter, views maybe covered by bad weather, but a nice restaurant to enjoy lunch or coffee with your love ones is nice. Getting there is easy, take the tram car and get on to the free shuttle."
Great views!,It was a nice ride up in a ropeway ( Cable car) and tram ( finnicular). The views are fantastic of snowed over mountains and Sapporo!  You can trek down on a snowed over path if you are up to it.  Cold at wintertime up there.
"Great views, wrap up warm in winter!","I went on a friday night to see the city views and was easy to get to from Susukino, I used the streetcar and free shuttle. The views are really great but its very cold in January and be sure to wear warm clothes for the ride up and to spend a decent amount of time outside enjoying the view. Easy to navigate the whole trip with english only"
Beautiful Sapporo Night View,"When we visited Mt.Moiwa, it was slightly snowy. The floor of ticket counter, there was a board that tells you the condition of top of the mountain. Unfortunately, it says ""unclear view"". However, we decided to take a risk. We paid 1,700 yen for return tickets.The rope-way was smooth and comfortable. We could see Sapporo night view. There is a transfer before reach the top. During transferring, we could stay inside the building all the time so it was nice especially in the cold weather. The second cable-car was very short ride and smooth again.  The top of the mountain, there are observation deck,restaurant, cafe and mini-theater, We were planning to have hot drinks after observation deck but they closed at 9:00. So we missed it. Since the board said ""unclear view"", we didn't expect so much. However, it was way better than we expected. It depends on wind and direction. We brought extra clothes so we were able to put them on and could stay longer on the deck. Actually, it was a good idea, while we were staying on the deck, the clearness has changed. It is all about timing. When we left the deck, the part that we couldn't see when we arrived was clear.  After observation deck, we couldn't have hot drinks but we went to the mini-theater. We watched the program of universe/planetarium. The seat was comfortable (the pillow was super!). The program was very impressed. It was educational, as well. It was much better than one which we saw in Tokyo."
Best spot to catch the entire Sapporo City!,"The ropeway and cable car experience up MT Moiwa was unforgettable for our 2 boys. Be there just before 4 pm to catch both daylight, sunset and the amazing night views of the city."
Scenic,"Very easy to reach by taking the streetcar from susukino to the ropeway stop. Then turn right to go to the bus stop where the free shuttle bus will take you to mt moiwa station. On a good clear day, the best time  to visit is about an hour  before sun down so that you can enjoy the  view of both the day n nite view of sapporo."
NOT good for snowy day.,"Free shuttle every 30 minutes to the main entrance. Otherwise 15 minutes walk uphill. ¥1,600 return ticket for cable car to the mountain top. There is a souvenir shop, vending machine, restaurant and a kiosk."
Sapporo View,Worth a visit to view Sapporo from top. The only   dissapoint aspect is the cabel car. They put as many people posibble in the cabel car. Saw 1 old lady fall from the cabel car.
Good view of Sapporo City at the top of the mountain,The location offers a good view of the city.  Either during the day where you see all of sapporo or in the evening when the city lights are on.you pay for the ticket (inclusive of the cable car rides) to go to the top.  A good place to spend an hour.
Best view of Sapporo,"Went to mount Moiwa is really worth the trip. Our family enjoyed the cool weather of Sapporo. Highly recommended for family traveling together. Getting to the area is easy, take the street car either at Odori or Susukino then drop off at the ropeway station then there is a free shuttle going to the base station. Dont forget to get the discount coupon at the street car."
Awesome view,This is my second time to Sapporo but my first to Mt Moiwa. Breathtaking views!! It's also very easy to access from Susukino. Definitely worth the visit!
Outstanding view in every season.,"I have been to mount Moiwa for few times, either solo or recommend to my friends. The scene on the observatory of Mount Moiwa is amazing in every season. You will see green during summer, yellow/red during summer, or white landscape during winter.However, the most important is the night view, it is just amazing."
Great view ,"Took a tram and alighted at the ropeway stop. There is a shuttle bus nearby just behind one of the tram stop. The intervals are about 15 mins between each trip. View from the top of the mountain  is beautiful . You can see the city and the mountains in the background. There is also a restaurant , a cafe and a souvenir shop ."
Loved it!,"This place is definitely worth going. The view from the top was amazing, the view while riding the cable car up was equally breathtaking. My siblings and I had a great time having snow fights and building snowmen there, hiking trails were also available for those who are more adventurous. Food is a little pricey there but the view from the restaurant was beautiful. Definitely recommended for people of all ages. I was there during the day, I would highly suggest going for the night view instead!"
Good to go if you have ample time,Reminds me of The Peak in Hong Kong. An accessible mountain in a city. Buy the tickets up to the top and enjoy the view of Sapporo city. Can be done in an hour if there's no crowd.
Great View,"The ropeway is a great way to have a view of the city - the view from the top is quite lovely, and they have a small couples activity at the top (you ring a bell...). There is a stop midway, where you change cars, where there is a souvenir shop, and access to the outside. There is a cafe and restaurant at the top of the mountain, as well as a theatre that plays a space/constellation themed film. If you are going in cooler weather, make sure you wear a few extra layers, as it is significantly colder at the top of the mountain - I went in Autumn, and it was snowing and freezing!!"
"Amazing views, worth taking the time","The views from the top are second to none of the Sapporo area and beyond. You can catch the local bus right to the door. Take bus #11 from Maruyama Koen, which is a stop on the Tozai line subway.It was ¥1700 each to the top. There is a stop halfway up where you change cableway. There is a restaurant at the top for romantic dinners and a little take away shop selling snacks and drinks too. There is a love dedication type of activity for couples. Suggest going on sunset so you can see the sun go down and the city light up."
Beautiful scenery of Sapporo,"2 stage ropeway, beautiful view of Sapporo up there, it's very cold even in October, not far from Center of Sapporo"
Excellent View of the City!,"My trip to Mount Moiwa was a memorable one!The cable car station was easily accessible and the going up the mount via the cable car followed by the tram was an adventure in its own right.Do note that due to it altitude, the outdoor viewing platform tends to be very windy and hence cold in winter. Do note that if you are going by the city circle tram, there are discount coupons available onboard which you could use for the cable car ride."
Love is Also in the Air,"Convenient ride by Tram and shuttle up and experience two type of 'lifts' up the mountain top. Feel the air and love, Also wait til its darker and have a night view of the spectacular city and you tell me what you think !..... Remember to lock your love away too."
Beautiful Night Views,"We went up the Mt. Moiwa ropeway all the way up to the observatory. Really easy to get to and a fast trip. It was pretty cold though so you don't want to spend too much time out on the deck. Beautiful views at night, but I think I might've preferred to see it in the daytime."
A place with a great view of Sapporo,"This is the right place if you want to see the Sapporo city view.To reach the place, you need to take a street car to Ropeway Iriguchi station. From there, you can either walk to the base station or take a shuttle bus (which is running every 15 minutes).At the base station, you can purchase tickets to the mid station (using a cable car or ropeway) followed by a Morris car to the top of the summit. It was an amazing view to see Sapporo both in the morning or evening."
"Nice view, easy logistics","How to reach Mt. Moiwa observation.The best way to get Mt. Moiwa is to use city tram loop. You'll need station ""ロープウエイ入口"" (rōpu uei iriguchi). Price for. Tram is 170円 w/o price zones. Take a look inside a car, normally you can find there free coupons in the pockets with printing give aways for ropeway to Mt. Moiwa, that gives you 2-way ticket for 1500円 instead of 1700円. 200円 only, but c'mon it is 1 zone trip via subway or a can of beer or whatever. ))Depend the way you've came this station (clockwise or counter clockwise) go to to left (in case of clockwise tram way) or right in other case. There will be small bus stop where free bus shuttle to Ropeway station is going. Take this shuttle, 5 min and you are there.Ropeway consists of 2 parts, you'll need to use both. There is no reason to stay on the 1st station. Main observation point is on the top.Good luck!"
Good views of Sapporo,Quick trip up by funicular railway. Excellent views over the city and surrounding countryside. Spectacular autumn colours in October. Good link with city tram.
A must to visit for superv sapporo view!,"Been there during Winter, the view is 'whitely+snowly' superb! It is worth a visit. You need to take a cable car to go up to the peak and this is one of the must visit attraction in Sapporo. Easily accessible by public transport too and they do have a free shuttle bus from a certain bus stand. Suitable for anybody."
Relaxing break in the city ,"I visited in late October when the Mt Moiwa Ropeway was closed. Thanks to that I could experience my visit there in complete solitude. Beautiful park covers the slopes of the mountain, and this time of the year the autumn colours were at their peak. Nice place for a relaxing stroll,  not far from the downtown."
Loved it here!,"We visited during Autumn weather meaning just a jacket was sufficient for a nice walk. There is a restaurant but take a picnic and have lunch on the grass at the top. Also if you intend to lock a padlock on the gate at the top and ring the bell... Buy one from the town first as they are 1,000 Yen from the gift shop at the top. Take the cable rope way to the top and the. Walk back down of you are up for it, the bush track is beautiful!"
Great Sapporo view,Its been done up since I last went up but the new setup is much nicer. The view of Sapporo is one of the best probably besides Mt Teine.
Great view over Sapporo,"This was a very good attraction, where you go up on a cable car then a morris car to get to the lookout at the very top.  It is very easy to get here by taking the monorail, then you walk to the right and get the free shuttle to the base of the cable car.  Once there you can go to the shop and looks around the mountain and take photos of the city.  We went during the day and the view was amazing, even though it was overcast.  I have also seen many night photos, personally I thought it was easy to get here during the day and we went up Sapporo tower at night."
Great panoramic view,"Drove here from Sapporo, about 15-20mins drive. Plenty of parking. If you have the discount coupons (check with your hotel or look around in JR stations or in the airport when you arrive), it is a little cheaper. Do bring a jacket as it gets chilly and there are some strong winds. If you have no time to go out of the city and just want a feel of snow, there's quite a bit of snow on the mountains. I saw parents bringing their kids out to take photos and play around in the snow. Check out the panoramic views! You can even attach a padlock lock to the railings and ring the bell. It is supposed to bring lovers good luck and happiness. Drinks and food in winter are a little scarce. I remember having to crowd around a counter as the restaurant was closed."
"Sapporo from ""far above"" :)","Saw this city from three different heights: one on top of the JR Tower above Sapporo Station, one on top of Mt. Moere at Moerenuma Park to the north of the city, and one on top of this mountain to the south of the city; but if you want an ""absolute panoramic"" view of the city, the big deck on top of this mountain is where you come although the location of the mountain being in the southwest of the city means you'll have to look ""north & east"" to see most of the city (there are really just mountains to the west & there's nothing much to the south either, but be sure to look to the southwest for some ""interesting shapes"" on the slopes & at the foot of some mountains there).  And yes, besides taking in the phenomenal views, there are things to see & do on the top deck such as the bell (I guess for love or peace), the love locks & the love sign (for great photo-ops), and in the building right below which has a cafe and a movie room where you can watch a nice short movie (just about 15 minutes, but it's ""3-D"") about the history of the Sapporo area from the prehistoric time (when the area was kind of like a sea) to the present.  Also, be sure to step outside the building and check out the little lovely shrine building (like hexagonal-shaped) on the west side beside the big satellite tower.You could take both cable cars (the first one from the bottom station to the mid station and the second one from the mid station to the top station) costing a total of like Y1,800 or you can save a few hundred yens by doing the stretch from the mid station to the top and vice-versa ""on foot"" (I only did that part on foot on my way down which took only about 10 minutes and saved me like Y300, but I wished then that I had walked up as well from the mid station after finding out how easy the paved path was with a gentle slope to the top; would have saved Y600 instead of just Y300).I took the tram (or streetcar) from Nishiyonchome Station (just like two blocks south of Odori Park in downtown) to Ropeway Iriguchi Station where there's a shuttle bus (free of charge) just across the street from that station, and a short 5-minute ride on it will bring you to the bottom station for the cable car which takes you to the mid station where I suggest just to walk up on the easy path (as mentioned above although the way up that I didn't do by taking the second cable car instead might take a bit more than 10 minutes)."
A great place for Sapporo night view,"We walked from Sapporo Station to Streetcar Station_Nishi yon chome (Stop nr. SC01) near Odori Park. The ride from SC01 to Ropeway iriguchi (Stop nr. SC10) took about 30 minutes . After getting off the streetcar, we crossed the road to the left, walked about 1 minute and found the Mt. Moiwa Shuttle Bus Stop. The free shuttle operated at regular intervals between the Shuttle Bus Stop and the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station.  Timetable was displayed at the station.At Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station, we bought return tickets to/from the summit which we had to change to ""Morris Car""(mini cable car) half way.  It was completely dark when we reached the summit and the panorama night view of Sapporo was so stunning. It's definitely worth to visit Mt. Moiwa at night. You could get a discount for buying tickets if you download HIS coupon from HIS website to your mobile phone on the day of your visit.  The coupon is valid only for one day, which is the day you download it from the website."
High on my to do list,Beautiful view of Sapporo! A must go when you're here. It can be a windy up the mountain so bring a jacket! The downstairs shop has quite a lot of snacks. We tried a few and it tasted very nice.
Need a good weather,"On our last day in Sapporo, we went to Mt Moiwa. Unfortunately, it was rainy and did not get much view of the area. From the photo gallery, we saw what we missed out on. There was some 3D sessions on Sapporo which was quite good, just that they were all in Japanese."
Nice view,We went to Mt. Moiwa for the night view of Sapporo. It was quite nice but was very crowded (I think it was a public holiday at the time). I believe there is a free shuttle from downtown Sapporo that takes you to the cable car station at the bottom of the mountain. We travelled by car to the mid-mountain station which cost 600 yen for a family sized car. Then it's another 600 yen per person to ride the cable car to the top.
One of the highlights of my trip in Hokkaido,"I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car couldn't stop saying how beautiful the view was when it starts ascending to the top. Keep in mind that you need to wait for 20-30 minutes to purchase the ticket(s) to get to the top (or 2nd station). I definitely recommend going all the way to the top, which will cost you 1.700Yen (round trip). Going to the second station will cost you 1.100Yen (round trip). Trust me, the view that you get worth every waiting minute."
Panoramic place,"It's the panoramic place of the city. It's nice during the sunset, however is not a fantastic view; there aren't particular things to see, just the city, lights...Expensive"
Awesome views and lovely ride up,Just overall a nice lovely place to visit. Very beautiful views of the city from the top. The ride up was great. Perhaps a tad pricy but still lovely.
Chayuttorn ,"wonderful place,we came here about 18:30 pm here is nice top view and the atmosphere around is cool we can take photos around Sapporo here"
Top of the Mountain...... But Terrible Customer Services.,It was a typical top of the mountain view. We drove up instead of paying Ropeway which is a cable car to the top.  It is much cheaper. The toll cost was 600 Yens as compared to 1560 yens per person. But we still need to pay again before they take you up by tram to the top of the mountain. We ended up picking up some local souvenirs.  the cashier does not speak english and she made sure you know as well!...so don't ask any questions...  We picked up some stuff by mistakes but she gave us a dirty look... Not impressed at all. But this is Japan... I recommend a night viewing instead...
Simply Spectacular,"Love this place as it provides me a spectacular panoramic view of Sapporo. The observation deck at the summit commands a splendid view of the Ishikari Plain, the Ishikari River, Ishikari Bay and Mt. Eniwadake in the vicinity of Lake Shikotsu and visitors can enjoy the abundant natural world.. In addition, the facilities impressive, and the restaurant/bar a great place for a cocktail. Enjoyed every minute of it. I recommend the view from the summit!"
New spot for great night view,札幌被選為新的三大夜景城市！北海道除了函館外，接下來就是札幌夜景開始慢慢有名！搭電車到纜車後去等接駁車，還蠻方便的！纜車需要搭兩段，紀念品店在第一段纜車到達的地方，九點就關門，想買紀念品要早一點買，一定要搭到第二段纜車處才能看到夜景全貌，如果天氣不好建議搭一段纜車在車上佔好一點的位置欣賞夜景即可！It takes around one hour for us to arrive the shuttle bus station but the shuttle bus comes frequently like every 10-15mins and convenient to go to cable car station. It takes two cable cars to reach the top and if you try to only take one cable car to the half way. You can't see the whole view only part of it because the view will be blocked by the cable car station. Remember to buy the souvenir first before taking the second cable car to the top of its close to 9pm. The night view is quite amazing if the weather is good. It totally deserves your time to go to take a look. It has been selected to one of the new top three best night view cities.
Beautiful View of Sapporo,"Anyone seeking a spectacular panoramic view of Sapporo will want to take the gondola to the top of Mt. Moiwa. The view was spectacular, the facilities impressive, and the restaurant/bar a great place for a cocktail. Enjoyed every minute of it."
Go up the ropeway and enjoy the beautiful view of the city.,Definitely a place to visit in Sapporo. Go up the ropeway and enjoy the view of the city. Worth a visit during the day or at night with the illuminated view of the city.
day view of the city,"interesting visit.but i'm sure better at night.some people went up there to picnic,complete with small portable gas stove."
See the ominous mountains in the distance,"From the tram, there is a synchronised connecting bus that takes you to the ropeway. I went in the evening in February and got a great view of the city, but the best thing was seeing the seemingly endless imposing mountains surrounding Sapporo."
Panaromic view of Sapporo city and surrounding mountain range,"A must go place in Sapporo. Evening time is the best time to go on a sunny day. As the sun shone on the city during sunset, the view was spectacular on evening sunshine reflection.Since we rented a car we decided to drive up and paid a toll of 660 yen instead of 1700 yen per person using ropeway which is really expensive. Unfortunately we can't drive all the way up to the top. From the car park, we can either hike up which is free and a bit of exercise or take less than a minute mini cable car up at 600 yen per person return trip. If it's a nice weather I would suggest hike up as it wasn't that high.It was quite cold and windy up there. Prepare jacket even on a summer day. We stayed until sunset is over but left before totally dark because it was too cold."
Romantic atmosphere despite the cold,Me and my wife enjoyed here at Mt. Moiwa. we arrive early evening and it was snowing. There was a structure like a inverted traingle where two can step in and rang the bell and when taken picture at night is romantic. The top offers good views on the city lights. you have to take 2 cable car rides to go to the summit. There is also a shop selling foodstuff and souvenir items in the middle part while waiting your cable car ride to the top.
Mt Moiwa Good Tourist Place,Mt Moiwa is located right within Sapporo. Easily accessible by electric street tram at a very reasonable price you can get on or get off along the main Susukino street. A 2 stage cable car takes visitors right to the summit. Clear excellent view of Sapporo city skyline. Very pleasant and enjoyable cable car ride. They provide free shuttle bus services from the street car stop. The street car drivers even provide visitors with discount coupons. DO NOT TAKE A LOCAL TOUR TO VISIT MT MOIWA.  Very easy expensive and lots of spoken Japanese. If you find your way via the underground pedestrian walk or by subway to Susukino you can take the charming street car right to Mt Moiwa all for a fraction of the price of a local tour. Besides you can take your dinner at Susukino and enjoy the very charming circle street car ride. Highly recommended
What a view,"We went just as the sun was setting on a clear night so the view was fantastic. The stars were out and we spent quite a while despite the windy chill. It can get quite crowded. And if you don't understand Japanese, skip the planetarium show."
Crowded cable car on a cold windy night,"We drove up the Mount Moiwa sightseeing road. We had to pay a toll for driving up this scenic road. However, we didn't realize this sightseeing road only brings us half way up, where we have to park our car & take a cable car that cost ¥600 per person to get to the top for viewing the city night view.We were going up when the sun was setting. The attendant at the cable car station packed us like sardines into the cable car when going up. It was uncomfortable during the short ride. Long queues also formed when coming down but the cable car station increased the frequency of the cable car to cope with the crowd.It was very windy & cold when we were up there. it may look spectacular to some but as for us, having been to scenic lookouts in quite a few cities & countries, many of them which are free, this seems costly & not so convenient."
Excellent night view.. cold too,"Although the cable car rides up were nothing to shout about (not cheap either), the night views were worthwhile. Plenty of locals visited the place too. The restaurant food was quite tasty. Kinda funny to see some couples sit side by side for dinner in order to catch the sunset.. not the most romantic of arrangements."
Great view over Sapporo,"I enjoyed the view over Sapporo from Mt Moiwa, pretty romantic place at sunset. Can get crowded at times though... But still a must-do in Sapporo !!"
Moiwa in June,We went Sapporo in Dec last year.The snow was thick & the view is white & Christmaslike!.so we decided to visit Moiwa in June.We took the ropeway up(if u take street car( there discount vouchers 200 Yen ) u can pick up & used for Moiwa.We have a nice view of the city.We enjoyed our coffee and yummy baked potatoes at the cafe.Really recommended.Scenic view & fresh air !
Easy to access by tram,Very easy to access by tram. Go to Mt Moiwa when the sun is setting to see the night lights over Sapporo.
Wonderful night view,Should take the cable car before sunset. You'll be able to see the day and night view of Sapporo landscape. It's very beautiful. You might want to know that there's  nothing much else you can do up there. Remember to wear something to keep you warm as it's very cold and windy at the observatory deck.
Beautiful view of Sapporo,"We made a brief visit to Mt. Moira after reading good reviews. It was still covered with snow. However, we still could relate to previous reviews that views from Mt. Moira IS beautiful!"
Amazing Views,Really great trip up to the top of Mt. Moiwa to see excellent views of Sapporo.  Went in the winter and saw a beautiful scene with snow and the city.  Really great.
One of the top 3 Night Views in Japan,"If you are in Sapporo, you must not miss Mt Moiwa. Recommended to go there in the evening to enjoy the sunset and illuminating city view. Take the tramp car from Odori Park station (counter clockwise direction) and get off at Ropeway Iriguchci Station. There is a shuttle bus from this place to the ropeway station and refer my photos for time table and location. However, ropeway station is less than 1km by walk but good to use the free shuttle if you are lazy to walk on a hilly road. Round ticket is 1700 and must go to the upper most station because nothing to see in the middle station. Cable car service is available untile around 9 pm. The view is simply amazing."
Sapporo Scenery from Mt. Moiwa,Good place to see Sapporo scenery especially at night when the light of the city already on. But you maybe can't go there when winter time because too cold.
Fantastic Experience!,"Came here during November, there was no snow yet but was very fresh. The place was very quiet which was great. The cable cars going up was an incredible experience. The view.....Well worth a visit when visiting Sapporo"
Must see,Great place. Go right before the sun sets. The restaurant is a must go. Amazing view. Had a blast.  Bear in mind that sometimes they close due to wind. Check the website before you go. It's not in English but copy and paste the message in Google Translate.
Worth the Visit,"FYI,  Senior Citizens are offered a rebate on the cable car ride up to the summit.All you have to do is to show your passport for age identification. Fortunately for us, when we went , there wasn't a long wait to take the cable car up to the summit, however, unfortunately for us it was a very cold night, despite the fact that we thought that we were dressed warmly enough.Although we had a quick look at the view, it was stunning and  we managed to take a couple of photos before ""running for shelter"" from the cold.  Will definitely make a return visit on a more pleasant night."
not as good as mount hakodate but still pleasant,"It was significantly less crowded than mount hakodate and the ropeway was longer, consisting of 2 separate cable car rides. Better to visit at night for the lights. Still a pleasant visit but not a must."
A must visit!!,"I visited 北海道神宮, Hokkaidō Jingū first and went back to Maruyamakoen Station to take bus 10 or 11 (210Yen) to Mt. Moiwa, around 15-20 mins bus ride. It doesn't stop directly in front of mt.moiwa, you have to walk up the hill for 5mins? If u don't know where to alight, u can approach the driver and ask him to inform you when you reach your destination or u can use google maps. Or from Susukino, take Sapporo's only streetcar line to ""Ropeway Iriguchi"" station (25 minutes, 170 yen, frequent departures). From there, a free shuttle bus operates to the lower ropeway station (5 minutes, departs every 20 minutes). Alternatively, the Mount Moiwa Ropeway can be reached in a five minute walk from the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop.From the Ropeway Mountain Base Station to the Mountainside Station in a cable car, takes roughly five minutes, plenty of time to take in the scenery all around you. Once you arrive at the Mountainside Station, you can take a break at the gift shop and change here to the ""Morris Car,"" it carries passengers to the Summit Station in less than two minutes.Once at the top, the Summit Station's rooftop observatory offers a 360-degree view, including the city of Sapporo and the aforementioned nearby mountains. There's also a French restaurant at the Summit Station and it allows every party to enjoy a window seat and the wonderful view of they city. You can also write any commemoration message on the padlock and leave it on the third floor of the summit observatory. So bring one along with you or u can get one at the Star Hall!1700 yen (roundtrip for ropeway and mini cable car) 1100 yen (roundtrip for ropeway only) 600 yen (roundtrip for mini cable car only)"
M&B Japan 2016,"It is a nice attractions, beautiful view over Sapporo. We went at the wrong time it was Golden week and there was a very long waiting getting down more than a 1 hour wait to leave. So pick your time carefully, it is worth seeing."
Stunning views ,"Absolutely sensational is only way to describe the views from the top ,we had a clear day surrounded by snow capped mountains looking out over the city of Sapporo to the sea"
nice view,"they provide free shuttle bus to Mt Moiwa. It's really a good facility for tourist. We went there in evening and wait till night, the scenery is nice and surprisingly not many tourist. Only at the time we left at about 8pm, a lot of japan school students go to Mt Moiwa."
Efficiently Run,"Enjoy the fabulous 360 degree views. I wish it was a little clearer but we still saw a lot. The tram was run very efficiently and we were not crammed in with skiers like in Aomori. They has a nice gift store here also, Pat liked the local corn snacks and we bought a large box of them"
Beautiful view well organised ,I have to say I was dreading going up here I imagined loads of people and massive lines. This was so pleasant. The cable cars leave every 15mins and are so well run. The view from the top was awesome. First viewing platform I have been on that 360deg views. The staff are very professional dressed so smartly. The restaurant was very disappointing few choices.
Great city view! One of the best places to visit in Sapporo,"It's pretty easy to get to Mt. Moiwa from Susukino by taking the streetcar (tram) to the Ropeway Iriguchi station. There's a free shuttle bus service at the foot of the mountain which will take you ropeway station in 5 minutes. Overall cost for cable car+morris car to the top of the mountain is 1,700yen. It was still covered in thick snow when we were there early April and the view from the top is simply amazing! Do drop by Jewel Restaurant and eat while enjoying the spectacular city view."
Wonderful views of the city,We travelled to Mt Moiwa at night and were rewarded with fantastic views of the city. East to access by tram and we went to the summit by cable car. However be warned it is freezing cold at the top.
Still cover in thick snow early April,"Mount Moiwa ropeway station can be reached by city trams or taxis not far from city. There is a free shuttle bus service a short distance from the foot of the mountain, tram station is just short walking distance away. The cable car fee to the top and back is 1700yen, there is a switch in between the first and second ropeway stations, different cable cars. End of March early April, the top part of the mountain still covered in thick snow but slowly melting away, the sunlight is intense, you can hear the snow melting. At the top there is a weather station or radio transmission base, a small Shinto temple and a lot of pay telescopes to look out. This should be the higest spot around the city area as we didn't see any higher ground from here. We were here during daytime, but I think the night view up here should be better as the whole city can be seen from here."
For climbers or hikers! Try it!!,"Go to ropeway inguchi station, there's a directional sign there that will lead you to Mt a kiwi free shuttle bus area, wait about 15-20min for bus interval and hop on to the bus and they will shuttle you to the base of Mt Moiwa. Now here you can either experience yourself taking the cabEx car to the top, or Di as many local did, Hike the mountain to the top! It was an amazing fun breathtaking experience, a must to try once ! You'll never regret it! Not too steep, a decent hike for beginner-intermediate hiker"
Great night scape view  of Sapporo city from Mt. Moiwa,Great place to admire the city scape of Sapporo. You'll be assisted along the way by the friendly and helpful staff of the observatory. From the shuttle bus driver to the guide in the ropeway(cable car) ride. Remember to pick up the discount vouchers from the JR station information center for the trip to Mt. Moiwa. Saves you a couple of hundred yens in the process. Enjoy the snow at the midway stop. Not to be missed destination when in Sapporo.
Great view.,"Had a bit of a problem trying to get here from the Maruyama bus terminal as they didn't have a ticket office there. After asking locals and bus captains (and slow attempts at reading bus schedules in japanese) we got onto our bus. You can take both bus 10 and 11 though you have to figure out the schedule as they do not go there all the time. If possible, ask the bus captain if he is going to ""Moiwa Sanroku Eki"", if he is not going there and he is nice (one refused to help), he will show you a schedule and point to the timing of the bus that will be going there. Costs about 210 yen per person from the bus terminal to the ropeway building.You could also take a free shuttle bus to and fro which will drop you off at a streetcar stop where you can take it to stops such as susukino, and costs a flat fee of 170 yen."
Worth the trip,"We took the local tram (street car) from the Susukino station and align at the Ropeway inguchi station (¥170).  After we alighted we turn left toward the mountain and after a short walk there is a free Mt Moiwa Shuttle Bus stop.The cable car ride to the summit is about ¥1700 and very fast and stable.  This give us the opportunity to see the changing scene outside the car and the mt.  It is worth it.As it is still winter, it could be rather cold (-4 degree on the day we visited) so do wear appropriate clothing for your trip.  The weather was good and clear and we were able to take in the whole of Sapporo city.  If it gets too cold, we can always go back into the observatory building."
Beautiful view,"Beautiful view from top of the mountain, we even witness a beautiful proposal of Japanese couple at the padlock bell."
great view of sapporo city,"Its very easy to go to mt moiwa and you shouldn't miss this when you go to sapporo.The good1. easy access, just ride the tram, the free shuttle and the ropeway to go to the top2. if you are feeling adventurous, you can climb the mountain by foot3. very nice background music while waiting in the lobby4. night view of sapporo city is one of the best!the bad1. during winter, it gets really really cold at the top2. very few selection of resto nearby (if you don't like eating in the observatory).my advice bring snacks and water, you might get hungry while you stay there."
Nice winter night view,"Got free shuttle bus service to the ropeway, went there around 7 plus at night, was packed with people but, if u got the time to slowly stroll around or wait for the next ride of cable car it will be fine. Was very cold up there, but who cares, the view is awesome!!"
Great view of the city at night,"very convenient tourist spot to go to, they have shuttle service from the tram station to the ropeway."
"Nice, green observation platform","A bit out of the main action in the town, but very easily accessed via the Tram and a free bus waiting in a well signposted spot half a block West from the Ropeway tram stop that will spare you a 10-minute walk up a steep hill. Lovely views from both the ropeway up to the first station, where there is a basic tea room and a gift shop, and then a little funicular up to the top viewing deck for a lovely vista of Sapporo and surrounding countryside. The whole excursion from the tram stop in the downtown area and back will take about 3 hours."
One of the best night views of Japan!,"I've been to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima. I must say the nightscape view of Mt. Moiwan overlooking Sapporo is the most breathtaking view I've ever saw. You got a bird's eye view of Hokkaido. Truly a sight to behold.!You just need to take the ropeway up to the midway station then compact cars to the summit. Also, to the lovers out there there's a lover's sanctuary at the summit station and fences for love-locks. Yes, you don't need to go to Paris to have a love-lock. What's more romantic than ringing a bell and having your love engraved at the summit of Mt. Moiwa with a dramatic view of Sapporo? Heck, I'd propose here if I have the chance. Truly one of the MUST GO spots!"
Beautiful view at night ,Definitely one of the top night scape views in hokkaido and even Japan. Almost 360 degree view of sapporo city and its surrounding. There's even a love symbol on top of the mountain where you can place a lock to secure your love. Beware it's very cold in winter.
Beautiful Mt. Moiwa,"The short 3.5 day vacation that my wife and I took in Sapporo during the Snow Festival week on February 4-8 would not have been complete without our half-day ""climb"" to Mt. Moiwa.We were assisted by our host who actually accompanied us to the place. But, even without our host, we would figured out how to get there via the subway and the street car. There is a bus that picks up guests every 15 minutes from the designated bus stop and then takes people up to the cable car station.The cable car ride was just great and fast.The 1,700-yen entrance to go up to the top was worth it. At the top, you can see the city of Sapporo. It was just beautiful up there. Since we went there around 10AM, we had a great view. As were coming down around around 2PM, it was already foggy and we could not see anything below. The view of the city was gone.The 800-yen, 30-minute snow cruise was also an excellent winter experience.Had we had more time, we would taken some ski lessons and done the experience. I would highly recommend doing this.One who goes to Sapporo during winter should not miss going up to Mt. Moiwa."
