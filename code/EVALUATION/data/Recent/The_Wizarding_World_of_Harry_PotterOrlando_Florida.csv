Best Day Ever.,I love this park I went there for my first anniversary and we have a lot o fun the Harry Porter castle is incredible.
To do,"We had a very nice visit to this castle, I read all of Harry Poter's books and this castle was a must for an enthusiast, everything was very well done"
Honeymoon ,Universal did a great job on their Harry Potter attractions.  You are never to old for an interactive wand.  Their newest ride Hagrids is amazing.
For all ages,"My children have been fans of Harry Poter for years, we thought that we parents would be bored but in real life the whole family loved it, beautiful"
Awesome! ,Hands down the beat part of our vacation. No expense was spared on detail. My son loved every bit of it.
For all the family,"we came here to make our kids happy and we all loved it, had a great time and it s a great memory , to do"
"great time, immerse yourself in a life like realm","hand sanitizer and temp checks upon arrival. additional hand sanitizer when you are greeted by team members in each attraction. This attraction was amazing. I never read the book, and only saw a few movies but I felt like I was at Hogwarts. We had a very enjoyable time. Staff was super friendly, social distancing practiced and good sanitation practices."
Best. Place. Ever. ,"I‚Äôve been to WWOHP several times and it‚Äôs one of my favorites. I spent my 40th bday there this year. ‚ù§Ô∏è. The parks are really well done and it feels like you are in the story. I love the rides- the new one (Hagrid‚Äôs) is phenomenal. Butter beer, Wands, Magic... this place is awesome."
LOVE IT,We loved the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It is immersive and just like the movies and books. My daughter loved it.
Becoming part of this World,First time visit and the family was in awe. 1st day Diagon Alley in Universal. 2nd day we took the train from King Cross station to Hogsmeade in Islands of adventure. We were so wrapped up in the interactive wands and the amazing detail that it wasn't until the 3rd day that we made an attempt at all the rides. Hagreds was the only one we didn't experience. I would suggest to take your time and go to every shop. Different experiences
Exceeds Your Expectations,Awesome attention to detail in every way. Exceeded my expectations and that of my 5 Family members that visited the park this past week
"Cool to see, too crowded to enjoy","I really wanted to be excited about this, had waited years to come.  When we visited the first time at Christmas it was packed wall to wall with humans to the point where you couldn't step forward without running into someone.  Lines were outrageous.   Went again during Covid, gotta be better since we're not letting as many people in?  No.  Now you have to reserve a ride time. Never got on Hagrid's Motorbike, one of the best attractions, even after trying all day for a time.  I hate that so many people are let in.  Don't know the solution but do know it's not at all enjoyable."
Wonderful,Magical to say the least. Crowds were somewhat busy but not a problem if you're there for the day and just taking your time. Always a smile from the cast and crew and great atmosphere
Employee with a bad attitude,"This is my second time visiting this theme park and I still see the same employee name Emily at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride with a bad attitude. I already complained about her in July 2020. The next time I see her, I‚Äôll video camera her showing off her bad attitude. I want to come here to spend time with my family on the weekend, not to get mistreated by a employee at Universal Islands of Adventure."
GO NOW!,Nobody at the Park!!!  We walked onto all rides and did all the experiences - SEVERAL Times.  We loved it...IT WAS MAGICAL!
MAGICAL! ,We were blown away with how detailed the Harry Potter Wizarding World at Universal was. They have everything you can think of. It really felt like we were walking around in the movie. Food was just like what was described in the books/movies. We cannot wait to go back.
Must See,"If you are even a somewhat fan of the Harry Potter books, you definitely need to take a day and explore the entire Wizarding World.  While the rides are great, its also a lot of fun just walking around and seeing how well they have recreated the feeling of the movies."
One of the best parts of Universal!,"There are so many things to do in this area of the park. Get a butterbeer, make your own wand, check out the cool shops down the side streets and of course the rides! Even if you don't particularly like Harry Potter, you will enjoy this area."
Holiday,It‚Äôs Harry Potter need I say more. If you want to learn magic or cast a spell this is the most magical place to be üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My favourite in the world!!!,"I absolutely love this. I suppose I will never grow up....this is just so fantastic. Go on a Monday, hardly any queues."
Truly Impressive,"Both parts of the world are great, don't miss either of them. Also, I think the Hogwarts Express is worth getting the park to park ticket.This is by FAR the best part of Universal."
We love Harry Potter,Escape from Gringotts is the the best ride.  We also loved the hogwarts castle ride.  Not to mention how great the butter bear is.
A true Harry Potter fan will enjoy it,"It is important to point out to get the full Harry Potter effect that you need to have 2-Park pass as Hogwart is located in island of Adventure and Diagon Alley is in the Studios Park.  You can board the Hogwart Express in either park as an alternate way to access the park but they will check your tickets in order to ensure you have a 2-park pass. I personally prefer the way they designed Diagon Alley due to the fact as soon as you enter it, you do not see other sections of park (you access the Alley through a hole in the wall near the train station).  While at Island of Adventure, you are not fully immersed in to the world of Harry Potter."
Favorite place ever,"It's so freaking cool that Universal made a Harry Potter world. And, Diagon Alley is even better than the original world. I recommend the frozen or warm Butterbeer; the regular one tasted kind of gross but the frozen/warm are delicious. If you're a Harry Potter fan, highly recommend leaving a lot of space in your luggage to take home some of the awesome souvenirs from HP World."
Love it,"If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you will not be disappointed on any of the attractions at Universal Studios. My daughter even got a Hufflepuff face mask to wear in the gift shop.  Escape from Gringotts is our favorite."
Great day visiting the wizarding world!,"Fantastic even during Covid,  every Harry Potter fan must experience at least once.  The new Hagrid rid is worth park admission alone!"
One of the best rides ever!,"Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure is one of the best rides I've ever ridden!  I don't want to spoil the experience, but if you're a true coaster enthusiast,  you will not be disappointed."
As magical as the books,"My husband and I first saw the Harry Potter exhibits several years ago, and I couldn't wait to go back.  All the details in both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley are a delight to the senses.  If you loved the books, you'll love this place."
Ugh,"Motion Sickness ALERT! Thank goodness for mask wearing and nobody else was sprayed. Staff was excellent in handling this situation and offered me a place to clean up, water and a disposable mask."
worth it!,I'm not even a Harry Potter fan but i loved this.  The detail is insane.  If you are a Harry Potter fan than paying extra for the train is worth it.
Amazing,"The best part of Islands of Adventure and Universal studios for me. Its just amazing, you feel like you're in a harry Potter film, and the rides and attractions are outstanding. If you go to Florida and you have the time please make sure you attend!"
Magical!!,"Definitely a highlight of our recent vacation!! My daughter ""spelled"" many muggles with her wand!! It was truly magical."
Very unique and worthwhile to see,"Movie magic in real life. They did a great job making this a realistic experience. The Harry Potter ride was well worth it. It was an excellent virtual experience. The technology has come a long way. The spherical screen makes you feel immersed in the imagery as if you are the only person/group in the ride. Even though there are many other cars/compartments next to you, you can't see the other people."
OH MY GOD !!!!!!!!,"If you are a Harry Potter fan this is the most amazing place in the world, but if you having watch you might not understand what the buildings, shops and restaurants, mean so please watch them you will enjoy it so much more. There is daily shows also with are fun but make sure you have sun-cream on cause its always in the sunniest place."
Best part of Universal!,"We are not huge Harry Potter fans, but we loved this part of the park!  It‚Äôs just like being in the movie.  Grab a wand and the decor is interactive.  Hagrid‚Äôs ride is one of the best I‚Äôve ridden.  And get the butter beer."
Amazing,"AS a huge HP fan I loved everything about it. The detail into making it look like the movies is incredible. Butterbeer, no like so much. I could spend all day there."
VERY WELL DONE - AMAZING ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!,"Alebit, not a huge Harry Potter fan before visiting (boys not interested), we are now! What a great show of bringing the movies to life! We actually watched the first movie after visiting and it brought it that much closer to home - was great going, ""we saw that... oh look, remember that?!"" Very well done, Universal."
So much fun!,Makes you feel like you have jumped right into the book.  The new motorbike ride is absolutely fantastic.  Our family loves it!!
Amazingly Well Done,"You know the World of Harry Potter.  If you are a fan you will love this place.  It is amazing in terms of what they have done with the rides, and the entire property has the themes and small touches that kids will love.  You gotta go!"
Best place for a Potterhead!,"A dream came true! Beautiful place, expecially for Diagon Alley and for the two main rides inside the Gringott and Hogwarts. Miss it so much!"
Rode hagrids over 20 times in 1 week ,"Right now the wait times are nothing. If not scared of getting CV, now is time to come. The parks are super clean and they take the mask wearing seriously. We have watching people spray down everything multiple times daily.We normally stay at one of main resorts to get Express passes but switched to sapphire falls since not busy and saved tons of money. No need for Express most rides are walk ons even if they say 20 or 25min wait. The mummy usually says 20mins but it's a walk on. Hagrids is only one that is virtual line but throughout day can get multiple rides. We have ridden hagrids over 20 times this week. Insane."
Surprised how much I enjoyed it !,"I am not any kind of Harry Potter fan at all, obviously aware of the ""boy wizard"" but never read a book or watched a film.....My partner was eager to visit though and so I dutifully followed on.However once there, I found myself enjoying the experience and even bought a wand !!!It is amazing how they've built this and well worth a visit......we ended up here overtime we went to the park."
Amazing scenery,We are not much of Harry Potter fans but this place looks amazing.  The rides are amazing and the scenery is great.
If you are a Harry Potter fan - Just do it!,"This themed area based on the Harry Potter series is a must do in Orlando.  Hogwarts Castle and the surrounding Hogsmeade village and rides are located inside Universal Studios Florida; Diagon Alley and its shops and rides are located in the Islands of Adventure. They are connected via the Hogwarts Express, a short themed train ride that‚Äôs only accessible when you purchase multi-park passes that allow you to travel between the two parks. Get the interactive wand!"
You feel like you‚Äôre there,This area is so much better than the rest of IoA.  The submersion in Harry Potter‚Äôs world brings the books to life.  Good collection of rides to engage varied age groups.
Disappointed adventure,We specifically bought the hopper tickets for the Hogwarts train Express and didn't get to take the train because it was having technical difficulties along with Hagrid's magical creatures motorbike adventures.  Was very disappointing to miss out on half of the Harry Potter rides.  The most frustrating was not being able to get any information on estimated fix time.  Wasn't able to ride the Hulk either because of technical difficulties.   I will say the virtual ride option was nice after we found it.  Overall was not worth the money for the hopper tickets.
"Felt uncomfortable in the crowd of unmasked, closely packed people","Visited during the virus pandemic hearing and being assured that safety and health precautions would be in place.  However that was not the case.  I was one of very few wearing a face covering; people were not following one way traffic lanes and crowds were milling around haphazardly.  Harry Potter area was packed with people not behaving responsibly so I did not feel comfortable enough to even walk in any stores or down any alleys.  Attraction Lines were long and winding right down the middle of the walkways with people walking back and forth.  I was disappointed that once I finally got to visit, I felt too crowded and not at all safe from the many others who were not practicing social distancing or mask wearing.  So I quickly glanced around, took a few pictures while trying to hold my breath and avoid running into people and moved on to a different area.  Was not a good experience at all.  Workers were not attempting to correct issues either.   Don‚Äôt go now!  Wait until later if you are at all concerned about your own health or your family‚Äôs well being.  Hand sanitizer was not available in many areas. Some wipes at food/eating stands."
Amazing this trip just as it was the first time.,"We always start our days in the Harry Potter area. With COVID going on and the adoption of the virtual line system, it made it super easy to get passes for Hagrid's  (we end up being able to get 2) and a lot less stressful to start our morning. Instead of rushing to get up and to the park gate by 7am, we took our time at the hotel, was able to book our virtual line passes for Hagrid's, took our time getting to the park, went and ate breakfast, and then rode Hagrid's. The virtual line pass system takes the magic of Harry Potter to another level. My only issue was ordering food at Three Broomsticks. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be but the servers and managers made sure we received our meal accurately and fresh."
"Good aesthetics, bad ride planning","It is amazing waking through and seeing the amount detail involved in this magical world. It was a really great visit to see it.The downside would be that the HP rides are not set up for medium/large framed people. I could fit in the park's largest roller coaster(Hulk), but not escape from Gringotts or Hagrids ride. It makes no sense that they made the ride so limiting. Other then that, go and enjoy. Drink some butter beer and pumpkin fizz and watch out for the dragon!!"
Butterbeer üç∫ üëå,"Not the biggest Harry Potter fan but really appreciated the detail shown to replicate the movie set. Also great feature if you buy an interactive wand the kids can scan it to find hidden surprises around the place. Recommend the butter beer, especially in the Florida heat!Also, Hagrid‚Äôs ride was one of the best in the two universal parks - virtual queue only so get on the app as soon as you arrive."
Amazing,"Without a doubt, this is the best area in the park, you feel like you're in the saga movies. The whole structure is very well built and the toys are incredible!"
100% recommended experience!!!,"Spectacular is the park area, for fans there is the wand shop and you can use them practicing in different areas of the area. Super fun. Butter beer WOW !!!!"
A wizard time,"As part of our trip of a lifetime. I went to the Harry Potter side of Universal with my granddaughters and youngest daughter. We went on the Hippogriff ride which was quite a short ride. The ride within Hogwarts was amazing. I confess I closed my eyes for a while as the Death Eaters got a bit much and I know one of my granddaughters was not impressed with the spiders. This may not be to every childs taste.we went on the Hogwarts Express which was really clever and everyone enjoyed and then wizzed around Gringots, my favourite 4D ride. Having visited the Knight Bus where we met Nigel and the Shruken head, both of whom were a bit cheeky, we then got the Hogwarts express back to the other side. The journeys on the Express are different each way so do go both ways.Unfortunately the queues for Hagrids ride which had just opened where too long for us to join but it sounded like everyone was having fun.I cannot recommend this enough. We had a ball. I loved Nigel and found it weird as a Londoner to be addressed by a pretty awful cockney accent which he dropped eventually. We spent some money in the shops and Diagon Alley. Harry Potter fans will be in their element.We had Butterbeer too."
Really cool and great casts helping the kids. ,The area is great. It is as I imagined it from reading. Staff were wonderful with my 7 and 5 year old.
A Lot of Muggle Fun!,"What a magical little world! This was my first time visiting Universal Studios, and I really enjoyed the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Even if you're not an avid Harry Potter fan, you will enjoy this area of the park. The new Hagrid ride was awesome! A little tip for reserving a virtual line spot for the ride: Check available times as soon as you arrive to the park. I hopped on the app while my husband was paying for parking, and was FINALLY able to reserve us a spot that morning. The previous day seemed to be full in regards to the virtual line pass reservations for the ride. If you like sweet treats, then I recommend trying the Butter Beer. It is delicious, but very sweet. The shops are very neat to browse. The restaurants get busy, so try to make your reservations early, if possible. We ate at The Three Broomsticks. The food was OK, but we wouldn't eat there again. The Forbidden Journey ride is also a really good one. I am prone to motion sickness, so I was slightly woozy afterwards, but it didn't last too long before I was ready to go again. If you wear flip-flops on that ride, be sure to hang on to them because your feet do hang down."
World of Harry Potter,The rides are wonderful and the park is authentic to the movie. The restaurant has delicious food. We will return and like Universal so much we bouth annual passes.
This place makes you feel happy to be alive,"Whether you've read the books or not, you will have a truly magical time in this Wizarding World. The overpriced yet irresistible frozen butterbeer (with no alcohol) is so delicious! The ride inside the castle is brand-new and captivating! The line isn't usually very long, either.The light show at night is splendid! I won't spoil the details for you, but I encourage anyone spending the day at Universal Studios to enjoy it. Have fun...I wish I was back there today."
Vacation,The ride was awesome. Not a Harry fan but I'm getting there. Definitely will bring kids on the next trip.
Great experence,The rides here are awesome. They are great for harry potter fans. And the lines are preety short. If you go there i would sugest hagrids motor bike. There are also fun little shops.
"Really cool, even for Muggles not UTD on the HP world","It's an amazing, immersive experience, very different from Disney.  Yes, it is pricey, but worth the money if you can swing it."
Fun but crowded,"So much attention to detail everywhere, and  all of the rides were so much fun especially Hagrids, but the lines were extremely  long and on a hot day when it is raining in the afternoon it made for a long day. I would split travelling here over several  days next time."
2nd Visit,"This place is amazing, this was my second visit.  Not a Harry Potter fan but really enjoy my visits.  It's like your in another world, incredible!"
OMG Amazing,"Brilliant, just brilliant. Authentic, engaging and enthralling. Loved it. First visit and ride on the train and Gringotts - wonderful, escapism at its best."
Magical Place for Muggles,"The entire World of Harry Potter is just amazing, the attention to detail is unreal. The rides are great, they transport you right into the world of Harry Potter. There are wands waving around everywhere and spells zooming into all of the shop windows! Even in the ladies restrooms you hear Moaning Myrtle doing her thing. We absolutely loved it and you must try a Butter Beer it is delicious!"
Like Stepping into Another World!,"This incredible place is not just for young kids or teens. I visited with my 33-year old Potter fanatic daughter and her 65-year old dad. When we walked through the brick wall that leads to Diagon Alley, it was truly like stepping into another world. Everything was very detailed and looked authentic. The food in all the restaurants was really good. Don't miss the train ride, Escape from Gringotts, or Forbidden Journey. Forbidden Journey truly made me feel like I was flying! We spent two full days here and it wasn't enough, I hope to return!"
I‚Äôm a wizard!  When can I go back?!,"OMG. This was my bucket list trip. I‚Äôve read all the Harry Potter books and have a HP tattoo on my wrist. I‚Äôm 32. Wizarding World exceeding all of my expectations!  I truly stepped out of Orlando and into Harry‚Äôs world. The stores, the rides, the staff, the food... all superb. My parents aren‚Äôt as familiar with HP and BOTH teared up multiple times because it was all so incredible. When can I go back?"
The Castle is truly Magical,"Absolutely in love with the wonderful job done on turning Florida in Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. We had a fantastic time roaming the shops in Diagon Alley. Went on the rides/attractions and had a great time. The train ride between Hogsmeade and Hogwarts is beautifully done, with the images and show that is given on the ride. Would highly recommend it for anyone even the slightest bit interested in the Harry Potter World!"
Wonderful detail and good rides ,"Great thought, detail, expense has gone into all things Harry Potter at Universal. Universal overall has an abundance of fun rides for adults and teens compared to Disney which is more kid friendly. We wanted to experience both Universal parks so got a one-day park-to-park pass. We mapped out what rides we wanted beforehand to save time. We went later in the day 3-8:30pm to avoid the worst of the crowds and it worked perfectly for us. We didn‚Äôt have to pay for expensive express passes, even though it was a busy week...because either lines were bearable later in day...or we just went in the single rider lines that were super fast...we always ended up on same carriage or very next one...and who cares who you are sitting next to in the pitch dark while screaming üòÜ...we got to stand in line together, and could see each other during rides most of the time.  And by the end of the day there were no lines. And we got to see the castle light show. The only ride we missed out on was the motorcycle one and that‚Äôs because it was broken/shut down for hours."
Amazing!,"Wish the hogwarts express journey was a bit cheaper (twice we have been to the parks and can‚Äôt justify the cost as not all the group are major HP fans), but other wise this place is amazing! Queues aren‚Äôt too long, when there are queues, the theming is so good that all the details keep you entertained, Locker system is well organised (maybe could make them a teeny bit bigger-so take two smaller bags rather than a big backpack) and SO much for HP fans to take in, even my mum who has never read the books/seen all the movies loved it! Plus we got engaged here which is a huge tick!!! Always in our hearts"
"Great rides, terrible lines","I have been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at both theme parks numerous times and I always come back for more. The rides are truly amazing, from the Forbidden Journey to Gringotts to the legendary Hagrid ride. The Express lines are a huge help in accessing almost these parks have to offer. However, my experience with Hagrid (aside from the ride itself; that was awesome!!!) was less than ideal. First, there is no Express line (I guess it‚Äôs to be fair to those who don‚Äôt have Express since it‚Äôs a new ride) and the Single Riders line is typically equal to the posted wait (or even longer, at which point it‚Äôs closed). When I was there (in February, a slow time in the season), the wait never went below 2 hours, and even peaked at 210 minutes one evening. What happened to the Virtual Line? They could easily control the queue by having everyone reserve a time in their app like they do for Race through New York and Fast and Furious. I heard that they sometimes use Virtual Line if the queue fills up, but even then it could still be a 3+ hour wait upon return. Or at the very least, Express should have SOME benefit to access this ride more conveniently, even if it doesn‚Äôt involve skipping the line. (Maybe once per day on Unlimited passes, or Express-exclusive virtual line).If something like this could be implemented, this park would be a 15 out of 10. Right now it‚Äôs only a 14 out of 10 :)"
Still the must see attraction in Orlando!!,The Hogwarts Castle is still the must see attraction in Orlando. Both as a attraction (Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey) and as landmark transporting into the World of Harry Potter bringing the best parts of the books to life.
Loved the castle lots to see went thru twice just so we could see everything and the graphics,Loved the castle lots to see went thru twice just so we could see everything and the graphics plus dont miss the pool of water that harry looks into in dumble dorfs place.Then dumble dorfs images as he speaks
Great for everyone,"If you're a Harry Potter fan this is a must. Even if you didn't plan to go to Universal Studios you need to change your mind. Also; (sorry to your wallet), but you need to visit both parks, to get the full experience.I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I still think this is the best part of Universal Studios right now...."
Awesome Ride,It was amazing. Long lines to get in this one. Highly recommend Fast Pass or single rider to get on faster.  Rode this about 5 times a day
Attention to detail ,"I‚Äôm not a Harry Potter fan but loved the area dedicated to Potter. My favourite ride was Forbidden journey, so well done and an amazing ride. The queues was only about 15 mins when we went. The ride is within the castle which in itself is a must see. A lot of thought and imagination. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like Butter beer but it‚Äôs delicious. Sweet with a slight milkshake texture. Hogwarts Express was better than I expected. The attention to detail was fab. Again no queue to ride. The buildings in the area are so well done, lots to see and take a few pics. By far the best area with both parks."
Amazing - detail is fabulous,"This is an amazing part of Universal and well worth a visit.  The detail they have put in will leave you speechless.  Do buy a wand ($60 but so worth it) at the very start of your day.... it was magical. Loved the rides they have put a lot of thought into both the ride and where you queue.I would say go here instead of Disney, better value for money."
Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"Diagon Alley was faithfully recreated. Listen and watch for the dragon. The lines were long for the ride, but it moved well and there were exhibits to watch along the way.  A short live play was featured. The Hogwarts Express ride was a mini adventure also."
Almost perfect!,"This is by far the best part of Universal.  You can skip the rest of the park if you ask me.  The design is amazing. Just a wonder to see.  However, the shops and restaurants were just ok and were manned by less than polite, unfriendly personnel.  Very unfortunate.  Also, super expensive."
"Great detail, but limited content","The creation of this part of Univeral is incredible and worth checking out. Unfortunately, the activities are somewhat limited. There are a few good rides but the wait times can be close to two hours. The other main activities are trying Butter Beer, and buying a wand and trying to cast spells at the many ""hot spots"" throuhout this part of the park. Most of it is just a crowd standing around. The light show at the castle is very good, but they cram a whole lot of people in a very tight space. It's a really interestiing place to walk through, but we actually didn't spend as much time there as we did at other parts of the park. (We were there as a couple with no kids)"
Amazing Setup,"Im not a big Harry Potter fan, but the way the whole thing is set up, with Hogwarts in the background is just amazing. I can't stand the overpriced Butterbeer, but everything else is pretty cool!"
Can't Miss if you are a harry potter fan,This is Attraction Can't be missed if you are a harry potter fan Everything about this park screens harry potter you should see both sides of the park to appreciate it
Hagrid ride.....wow !!!!,"This is a great area, would highly recommend a visit, the Hagrid ride is one of best I've ever been on !!"
Enchanting experience!,"If you are a lover of all things Harry Potter, you will LOVE this part of the Universal parks!  Ever detail is beautifully covered and the rides in this part of the park are sure to engage and thrill.  If you are an annual pass holder, make sure you show to get your discounts on your purchases!"
Your expectations will be met ,"If you are a Harry Potter fan you will be in heaven.  The butter beer is as you imagine, the magic shop is as fun and the atmosphere is spot on.  Bring your family and You‚Äôll have a blast making Hogwarts memories that‚Äôll last a lifetime!"
"5 star, plus!","Every detail is so thought out and fun! We were successful in riding Gringotts, Hogwarts Express, and Hagrid's ride by 10:30am both mornings we were there- even though we only had one day with a fast pass.  It helps to stay at an early admission hotel,  take the first shuttle, get in line for Universal Studios, then get in the line for Gringotts. We then went to Hogwart's Express and directly to Hagrid.All three of these rides are unique and highly entertaining!We easily got on the Forbidden Journey and the walk through the castle is almost as fun as the ride is! If you get motion sickness, beware, haha (my daughter rode it a couple of times more than I could).We also bought wands following the Ollivanders wand picking experience.  We used them throughout the park as we visited all of the shops.The food was reasonably priced and good!  We loved eating at the leaky cauldron and enjoyed butterbeer. :)Just a note on young children: These two parks are not designed for children under the height limit for riding. So many parents were holding crying kids who couldn't ride. :("
Hagrid ride is incredible,"The wizarding world has another great ride to offer in addition to the current tried √†nd tested quality entertainment. You may have to wait, but it is worth it..."
So magical,I‚Äôm not a Harry Potter fan but this castle was AMAZING.  We went right there right when we got to the park.  Had to try butter beer and it was delicious.  Got some great pictures by the castle. Wish I would have stayed for the nightlights overhead.  My teen loved it as well. Went in the gringots ride and that was a blast.
Mum your a wizard!,Hubby and I went to Hogsmead and Hogswart to our delight! I traveled on Broom chasing dementors and avoiding dragons. Of course I do let my imagination go into overtime and Im not jaded by accustom to super-duper realism like maybe the younger set but I loved it! Then we traveled to London and the Alley were you can get contraband Diagon Alley... I loved using my newly aquired wand! We got back on the train only to have dementors on board quite a scare!!We made back safely thoroughly satisfied with our adventure. Dont miss the wand shop!!!
Our happy place!,"We enjoy every visit!  My husband is a big Harry Potter fan and we enjoy the phenomenal theming.  Whether we are hitting the rides or just people watching, we are never disappointed. Mardi Gras was a blast this year.  The floats were spectacular!"
Felt like I was a student at Hogwarts- great attention to detail,From the speaking portraits hanging in the hall to floating candles and The Dark Arts Classroom - all amazing. Hagrids Magical Ride the best!
Magical Adventure - ready to do it again!,"Went to Universal for Harry Potter - our 10 year old granddaughter's obsession!  While it was HOT (July in FL!?!?!), we had a wonderful time with so many memories not soon forgotten.  It feels like you are really there and they make a lot of effort to stay true to the story.  Do it ALL, you won't be disappointed.   The ONLY thing they could improve is the interactive wands and locations.  Many times, the sun negatively impacted the effectiveness of the wands.  Its 2020, the tech needs to work!!!"
AMAZING!!!!,"I'm a massive Harry Potter fan and this didn't disappoint. Unfortunately I was 3 monthes pregnant so can't really comment on the rides, though we did go on the train. I'd recommend going both ways if you can as each are different - even the queues have different bits- I LOVED walking through the wall onto platform 9 3/4. You spend the whole time in awe of everything and feel as if you've really stepped into the Harry Potter world. We set aside a whole day to enjoy this - without rides! There's so many shows to see, and I also recommend the show at Ollivanders. We also tried butterbeer (not my favourite) and got some Gringotts money - this can be spent at Harry Potter world, but I chose to take mine home as a souvenir.  I also love the interactiveness of it all. If you buy a certain wand from ollivanders you will be given a map (or you can look out for the markings on the floor) and if you cast a specific spell the world around you will react. Magical!"
Exceeded all our expectations,"This place is absolutely incredible! The amount of detail put into everything in the whole Harry Potter area at Universal is amazing. The rides, the street scenes, the dining experiences, the shops, the performances, the interactive wands... it was all wonderful! Don't miss going through Hogwarts Castle and Gringotts Bank, and definitely give Butterbeer a try. My kids and I are huge Harry Potter fans and we were completely blown away. We spent three days here and could have easily spent more time. It truly was like stepping into a magical world."
Spring Break 2020,"Always love going to Hog Mead and Hogs Mead awesome.  Ride the train.  Do both areas.  The restaurant that serves chicken, roasted corn and baby potatoes is good food for a reasonable price."
Enjoyed all it had to offer.,"Other than Air Canada and their on-going issues, everyone in Orlando treated us royally and we were very pleased with the vacation."
Great for Adult Fans as Well as Children,"Everything I hoped it would be and more. Well worth the visit. Pricey, but great for a once every 5 years visit."
Magnificent,Amazing! From the moment you step foot in the Harry Potter World you are truly astonished to the shear detail of the Hogwarts Castle and it's surroundings. A truly special experience!
Fun even if we don‚Äôt wear black robes!!,"We took our grand son to Universal Studios for his seventh birthday. None of us are big Harry Potter fans, but it didn‚Äôt matter. We really enjoyed all of the harry potter rides and attractions. Maybe it‚Äôll get us to finally watch one of the movies."
Love it - a must for Potterheads.,"Beautifully realised with themed shops, eateries and rides - the new Hagrid's Motorcycle ride has recently opened and it is the best ride on site if you are a fan of rollercoasters... in fact it is about the best rollercoaster on or off site.You get to try Butterbeer in a few different formats - straight forward, iced, hot, ice-cream, pudding. You can buy your full uniform and school needs for Hogwarts, drink and eat at the three broomsticks -cum-Hog's Head or Leaky cauldron - all is here.The rides are filled with detail from the moment you start to queue and all are exciting with the thrill of the ride and recognition."
The magic of Potter still strong,"Had the pleasure of visiting both Diagon alley and hogs Meade. Both aspects of harry potter are mazing places to visit as well as the rides. The butter beer alone is worth the trip, maybe a chocolate frog or a wand to make some magic of your own while walking through the streets.  The train ride between the parks is cool and has great handicap abilities to transition between parks."
Magical!,We love Universal! 2nd visit.  So happy with our vacation here.  Wizarding World is simply amazing! Will return!
Magic tour,"The first thing we did after entering the park was dashing to HP world and taking the ride. I was not a big fan of HP but the building and all those decorations made me love this world and respect those who built this park. In the morning, the line was like 30min only, but after we took the ride,  the line seemed 1 or 2 hours long."
Just as exciting as the books and movies,"This was our 3rd time to visit Harry Potter world. We got to ride every ride, a few more than once! The detail, experience is so awesome. The newest ride, Hagrid‚Äôs motorcycle ride will always be remembered. Parts were unexpected but still worth the ride! The restaurants were yummy as usual. The stores are great to walk through. Brings memories of the books and movies to the front of ones mind."
Wow,"We went to Universal Studios on an after work conference . We were able to ride Hagrid`s Magical adventures motorbike ride, and it was an absolute thrill. There are so many surprises it makes your stomach drop and flip and your insides flutter. It is a great experience and if you get queezie on rollercoasters,  I suggest you sit this one out or take some dramamine before. This ride is a lot of fun.No pictures allowed so I didn't take any, and you would probably lose your phone if you did."
Loved it! ,Loved everything about it. Diagon alley was amazing and couldn‚Äôt wish to see anymore. The hogwarts train was also such a good idea to get to the next park. Would definitely recommend!
The ultimate Harry Potter adventure!,"Talk about a magical world ... this place is unbelievable! Diagon Alley is truly a marvel, with unsurpassed attention to every detail. Even waiting in line is a pleasure as it affords time to enjoy the details. Rides are fun, butter beer is a must, and it is an overall magical experience."
I want to live here,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so this was a must-visit. Words alone cannot say all that I want to about this magnificently magical place.  It was a very emotional experience, I  loved everything about it. The atmosphere was simply magical in every way. The attention to detail was breathtaking.  I literally cried when I had to leave. Must do- ride Hogwarts Express, Go to Ollivander's and get an interactive wand to use around the various places.  I loved Escape From Gringotts 3d ride, try and see the light show at night, it is greatI am definitely coming back one day"
I'm A Wizard Now!,I love going to the parks by myself and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is not different. It was wonderful seeing the movie and books come to life! The details are amazing and really immerse you in the land. I have tried some of the food options and they have decent food. The rides are amazing and so on point I was shocked my first time.Definitely get a 2 park pass so you can ride the Hogwarts Express both ways! And get the butterbeer!
Hagrid's,That ride is the best I've ever experienced and if I'd had more time I would have loved to ride it multiple times. It was well.worth the wait.
The Wizard Review,A must see for all Muggles! As close to real as you can get. As always though be prepared to wait for it.
Amazing detail,Once in this world of magic and mystery you find yourself quickly awed by the attention to detail and authentic props and surroundings.  The immersion is visually and auditorily complete with roaring dragons!  The density of people is a bit daunting and there is no shortage of shops trying to tempt you to spend!
Engaging,"From the moment you walk into The Wizarding World you feel as if you are in the books & movies.  Everything is so well done.  The buildings, shopping & food are exactly what you hoped it would be."
Harry Potter,"Great time, must see both parks. Be sure to stay for the light show each night.Take the train from park to park and spend the day.Don‚Äôt miss Hagrid‚Äôs Ride, worth the line."
Not disappointed,Cool day. Amazing attraction. Highly recommend the fast passes. Baby swap areas are fantastic. Lots of walking
A fun day,Nice day at the park.  A little rain and some chills. It wasn't busy. It was a slow day for the park. It was nice not needing an express pass. Everyone and everything kept moving non-stop.
put yourself in the movies,"the harry potter experience at universal studios Orlando is incredible. daigon alley, Hogwatrs express, the bank the rides everything is just so amazing its like you are really in the movies"
Amazing park,"We had a great time! You do have to get there early if you want to avoid long waiting lines. Early march was a great time to go, not too many people. The great number of employees makes rides run a lot faster, very efficient!"
Bag policy - Only fanny packs with a 3 pronged clip are allowed on Hagrid‚Äôs motorbike Adventure,"Firstly, the ride is awesome. Secondly, if you have anything other than a 3 prong clip fanny pack, they will make you put it in a locker. At the ride, they will check the clip, and if you don‚Äôt have the right one, will make you get off and put it in a nearby locker. Lesson learned."
Always a great time,"It is usually packed, so be prepared for crowds. Try all the rides, Hagrids is the greatest and worth every second in line."
Fantastic,"Its exactly as you would expect - magical. As if you are actually stepping into the world of Harry Potter. My HP obsessed daughter was in heaven, even the one who has no interest usually was completely swept up in the atmosphere. Queues weren't as bad as expected, and definitely worth it, but the world itself is always busy. Definitely go both ways on the Hogwarts Express to get the full experience"
Great Experience,This is a great attraction to the park - especially for a Harry Potter fan.  The detail is amazing and you must keep an eye out for magical spells in progress.  The only part that you must do - and the Park knows this - is you MUST purchase a 2 park - one day ticket for $175.  Otherwise you cannot ride the Hogwarts Express to and from Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley.  You would only be able to see one.  You can totally do this park in one day - even with children as long as your focus is on Harry Potter and not Universal in general.
Great fun,"Like Harry Potter?, you have to go! All the Potter rides are good if you like roller coasters but Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is the one you mustn‚Äôt miss. Also it‚Äôs worth waiting for the light show at sundown."
SlytherClaw for Life,"We went for an after hours special event and had SO much fun. I could wander around Diagonal Alley for hours. Love the butterbeer and pumpkin juice. As soon as you walk into this area, you feel like you‚Äôre in a different world. The amazing dragon hanging overhead is so fun and all of the shops draw you in to leave all your money behind. Pretty sure we saw a wedding on the bridge outside Hogwarts!"
Not a Must See,"This attraction would have been REALLY cool if there were more space in Hogsmeade and more time in the Hogwarts castle. You can't really tell from viewing the Universal website what to expect. A. Hogsmeade: There were only a few shops that you could go into: Honeydukes sweet shop, where you can buy a chocolate frog for $12 (WHAT A RIPOFF) and the Owl Post, where there are tons of wands, mugs, tees, etc. The wands are $55 each. The   rest were FAKE WINDOW FRONTS!  Another RIPOFF!!!  For the price of admission, they could have done a lot more with this area!!!  It would have been really cool if there had been a museum instead of FAKE store fronts. But their objective is obviously just to make money. B. Hogwarts: You go on a lengthy hike through the castle to get to the ride and there is plenty of opportunity to view castle, pictures on wall, and movies. BUT IT IS SOOOOOO DARK that you can't really SEE ANYTHING!!   Again, this would have been really cool if there were the option to slowly walk through or it were brighter or there was more to see. The virtual reality ride at the end was HORRIBLE!!! Not recommended for anyone who gets dizzy, might puke up, doesn't like being jerked around. C. There were only two other rides: the Hippogriff ride and the Hagrid Magical Creatures ride, which had over 100 minutes wait. the Hippogriff ride is a coaster which lasted about 3 minutes. LAME!D. We ate lunch at the Leaky Cauldron, which was really good. We had chicken, corn on cob, potatoes and apple pie. Not dessert listed on the website. E.  We had some butter beer, which is essentially a ginger fizzy drink with whipped cream foam on the top. Whenever I tried to taste the foam, I just got the drink underneath, which really wasn't very good. F. Saw the Frog Choir. Which was 5 singers and a couple of large fake frogs puppets on pillows who were fake singing. G. Next to the Owl shop was ""Ollivanders"" which you cannot enter, but have to wait in line for a ""Show"" where one audience participant (Child) is chosen to pick a wand. The problem, again, very dark inside, the person who was the ""Shop Owner or Tour guide was Hard to Understand"" with a fake accent. Then you were shown through to the shop on the other side where the wands were available to purchase. Apparently, you could use your wand to point at various fake shop windows and something would happen. Didn't work in most cases. I wouldn't waste my time with this experience. Certainly not worth the extremely steep fee to visit, plus the parking fee and all purchases and food were expensive. We did not stay all day and left around 1 pm.SAD!!"
"Absolutely unique, amazing and must do","Get inside Hogwards, visit Hogsmeade, play Quiddich and get on with Hagrids magical Motorbike Ride.. It's more than amazing. Be sure to be prepared for very long lines - but its worth it."
Wizards at play ,"Visited here as a family of 4 , unbelievable it‚Äôs like stepping into hog warts, it‚Äôs so immersive, the brains at universal really out did themselves, I will return for sure. Absolutely awesome."
Could I please just live here?,"We had the greatest time playing at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter! We bought robes for each of our houses, got wands that were suggested during our session at Olivanders, rode every ride a could of times, ate at all of the places and really decided we like Pumpkin Juice better that Butter Beer. Can't wait to go back!"
This Place Made Me A Hogwarts Fan!,My wife and I had never seen any of these movies or read the books but we were hooked by all of the amazing details of this area of Islands of Adventure.  We watched all eight films and returned within two weeks.
Soooooo much fun!!!,"Our family loves this part of the parks! Our kids are almost 7 and while they aren't into Harry Potter yet, they do love this area! It was so well-designed that it appeals to them."
Must See Harry Potter,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, you must make sure to see this attraction at Universal Florida. Great for the whole family."
Another world,"I have never seen a Harry Potter movie until we decided to come here. I had to see what the huge talk was and how people liked Universal better than Disneyworld!  Really???  I‚Äôm in my 60s and a all Disney LAND girl....Just wait though...       If you go make sure you see at least the 1st movie so you understand the meaning of all the buildings  This  is a unbelievable, fantastic, outdone of sculptures on buildings etc..... area.  It truly made me feel like We were  IN the actual time this all took place.  I wish more kids had bought the wizard robe cloak , it made it so much more fun to see them go from spot to spot to whisk their magic wizard wands at the certain points.  I‚Äôm sure they cost a pretty penny so I understand that....but to bad they couldn‚Äôt have had low priced ones so non rich families could get in the fun.  The wands were about $25 and ......up!!     My daughter and I did a non VIP tour at Universal..hands down a great thing to do! The breakfast buffet was pretty good and then the outstanding lunch buffet with foods made for VIP only was a surprise since I don‚Äôt remember it mentioning lunch included.  Well worth the money for older children to adults. Definitely this is the only way I would ever do this again, others in the group of 12 said same thing as this was not their first time.  We did get 2 days there so we could go back and do our own thing the next day, worked well.       We went to the horror show which was fun for all ages...but we both were expecting something a lot different. We thought it was going to be really good from plain face on someone to change them up with great makeup, showing us how it‚Äôs done it was not even close..just ok, full laughs.   The light show was super great and amazing of the wizard castle .... wish it had more lights though, still great for their theme.       All in all people...here it is!  I agree with the others, this beats Disneyworld!  ( can‚Äôt believe I would ever say that ) I have to add though Disney castle light show out beats ALL? Fantastic job.    If you want to get away from your life..go here!"
A lot to see,"Not into riding rides, but the detail of the buildings is worth looking at.Amazing the shops and things to look at"
Enchanting!,"We loved the rides, as well as the attention to detail that made our visit a delight! We ignored the touring plan, which advised us to wait until later in the day to go. I‚Äôm glad we headed right to Diagon Alley as soon as we got early entry, because it only got more crowded as the day went on (and we were there on days that the crowd calendar said would be moderate). With an express pass, we didn‚Äôt wait more than ten minutes for anything, except Hagrid‚Äôs ride. It was only open part of the day and wasn‚Äôt accepting express passes. That wait was almost three hours long, though the wait time was stated as 125 minutes when we joined the queue."
Awesome time at Hogwarts,My fianc√© and I went to The Wizarding World back in August and had an amazing time. We went during hurricane season right before a hurricane hit and it was the perfect time. The lines were almost empty for all of the rides. This was right after the new ride opened for Hagrid‚Äôs MotorBike Adventure. We waited for less than an hour to get on and ride. The food was delicious and they had many spots that you could use the interactive wands on. The acting in  Ollivanders wand shop was perfect. The only downside was that we had waited for almost an hour to see the dragon move and spit fire and it never did. We were told it was supposed to be every 15 minutes or so but it never happened. Still an awesome time and an amazing experience.
Hagrid‚Äôs Ride is the Best!,"If you do nothing else at HP world, you have to get on Hagrid‚Äôs ride. It‚Äôs hands down the best one. Everything else was just ok. I was a bit disappointed in the butter beer. I would‚Äôve rather had root beer, honestly. SNS."
One of the ride attendants made this magical,"We are on a 2 week holiday to Orlando, Florida with our young family bouncing between Disney World and Universal Studios. We have had an amazing time overall.  However, in Universal the only rollercoaster rides discriminate against those with larger stomachs when you cannot pull the safety bars down over yourself. Unlike Disney which caters for all shapes and sizes, there were 3 rides in Universal I tried to go on and all 3 times I had to humiliatingly leave the ride seat because my stomach poked up and the safety bar wouldn't go down ""3 clicks"".  Yes, there are seats you can try before you go into the rides and yes I am a larger lady but I have been particularly bloated this last week here. Regardless of this, I felt discriminated against and am disappointed that these actual rides within Universal, and not the simulator type rides, were so inaccessible and non-inclusive to people of different sizes. This ride, The Mummy Returns and Harry Potter ride in Islands of Adventures left me feeling humiliated.  Why can't Universal find a formula that is more inclusive so more can ride their actual rides? By this third time of being made to wait by the exit I burst into tears and felt absolutely awful. A young ride attendant by the name of Nikki was really kind and sympathetic towards my problem. She went to the effort of chatting to me to cheer me up which was lovely of her. I thought little more of it until she suggested she would like to make me feel better by taking us to the candy store to buy token gifts for my family and me which was above and beyond. She didn't need to do this but I just wanted I single her out for her wonderful inclusive attitude which made me feel welcome and valued at a time when the rides had done the opposite. So thank you Nikki!It's worth noting that I spent most of last year losing weight for myself (4 stone) not for this trip, and had done amazingly well, but due to health issues, I bloated out massively in the last few weeks which made me feel huge again, which was then made worse by being made to feel Humungous for these rides. Other than this, the Harry Potter area is a magical wonderful representation of what Diagon Alley etc should be like. Very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, wonderful amount of detail and definitely worth a visit! This would have been 5 out of 5 had it not been for the rides."
Absolutely awesome! You must go!,Absolutely amazing! Totally worth the cost and a must do! Great for both kids and adults! They did a fantastic job or capturing the details from books and movies and making them come alive! It was my husband and I and we lived it. The rides were awesome and you felt like you were really part of the adventure! Long wait times sometimes so but express passes or at least be sure to use the universal app to watch the edit times and get to the rides when they are low ! Must buy 2 park..park to park passes to ride hogwarts express and will at least need 2 park to do HP on both parks !
Awesome show,Absolutely  love it!! The village feel soo real. Like in a movie. The light show was incredible.  Rides were cool. Would love to  be back!
Truly magical,"We visited this attraction at about 3pm, hoping the crowds had dispersed a bit, having done the rest of islands of adventure earlier in the day. It was still very busy but the ride queues were not overly long, except Hagrid‚Äôs ride, which had a 135 min wait (previous days I had seen a 210 min wait).  We skipped that and did Harry‚Äôs ride and Flight if the Hippogriff, both under 35 min. Harry‚Äôs ride is absolutely incredible, one of the best I‚Äôve ever been on. And the queue inside the castle is highly entertaining (and air conditioned). This is after you‚Äôve shoved your backpack in the tiny lockers they require your belongings to be kept in. Hogsmead was incredibly crowded and difficult to manoeuvre. The obligatory butterbeer will set you back a good chunk of change. But the whole setting was incredible and magical, and really rang true to the books. We picked up a few souvenirs, but i recommend checking out the tons of gift shops in the area that sells Harry Potter merchandise for a fraction of the cost. I‚Äôm giving four stars as I really resent having to buy a park hopper to visit the whole thing (we didn‚Äôt and thus did not ride the Hogwarts express or visit the part at Universal Studios)."
Great for kids,This is a wonderful experience for most kids . It transports them into their Harry Potter books in a very real way. They‚Äôll love all the stuff for sale . But you‚Äôll need to get there early. It gets increasingly busy as the day progresses.
Almost Exactly Like the Movies,"Everything is awesome! The butterbeer is great, food is pretty good, and the decor and rides are incredible! I think the frozen butterbeer is the best, but the soft serve is good too. The food at the Leaky Cauldron and Three Broomsticks is the same. The Hagrid ride is fabulous! I would recommend this to everyone!"
What Can I Say?,"It's all been said before but I have to add my comments as well. We made a couples visit to the WWofHP and were incredibly impressed. Even without kids in tow, we were thoroughly swept up in the ambiance of Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. The attention to detail of both areas is amazing. The rides were first rate and technological marvels. Good food and a wonderful environment at the Three Broomsticks. Butterbeer flowing everywhere! And one of the best parts was watching the kids, dressed in their wizard robes, move about the village performing magical spells with their newly acquired wands. J. K. Rowling should be very pleased with what has been done with her world."
Disappointingly ,"If you like jerky,  extreme roller coaster rides,  you will love the Harry Potter rides.   To me, they weren't enjoyable.    If you have motion sickness or a bad neck or back , don't get on the Harry Potter rides. It was also very hard to find the area as it was poorly marked, even with a map and the app.   The train ride was cute,  we enjoyed that."
Great area of the park and Hagrid's ride Great,We enjoyed all the rides in the area and found Hagred's Magical Creures Motorbike Adventure was the best of our day.  Its a fun place to visit including the light show in the evening.  Very crowded during our visit.
Awesome,We loved the Harry Potter movies so it was amazing to see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter our grandkids watched the movies before we went  and they thought it was amazing had to get the wands of coarse and it was cool that they were interactive would definitely recommend
World class experience,"Other than being crowded, it really couldn't be any better for a HP fan.  The accuracy of everything is tremendous and it has great displays in both Universal Parks."
Great Stuff,"Very detailed and lots of fun. Even though I'm not overly knowledgeable about Harry Potter, it was still fun. Even, Ollivanders‚Ñ¢ wand shop, which is the ultimate cash grab, was funHighly recommend."
Amazingly detailed park area,"Brilliant design to this park area, it reallly does make you feel like you stepped into a Harry Potter movie. Unbelievable architecture, we could only imagine how much time was spent building something like this. We made return visits over several days only to notice new things we totally missed the days before.  Detailed buildings and walkways. Even the stores and dark halls have surprises to discover.  If you visit this section of the park, take your time to explore. A must see for a Harry potter fan or die hard Fantasy adventure type personality. Happy visiting  !"
Great place to see!,The details and accuracy of everything was amazing! Loved the wand shop and the rides were all very cool.
Great entertainment to prepare you for ride into Harry's world!,"Long wait enhanced by videos and statues; speaking pictures, etc. Swooping, jerky ride inside well worth the wait-  prefer not for preschool children."
Universal studios,The motion rides and harry potter village is awesome but prepared to be dollared to death. I believe in a business making a profit but to charge $15 for a damn corndog? And even charged for lockers if your ride lasted longer than normal.
It's Harry Potter's World Come to Life!,"While we liked Diagon Alley the previous day, we were even more impressed with Hogsmeade and Hogwarts! So many shops to explore. Get the frozen butterbeer to cool you off on a hot day!"
Learned while having fun,"My son and his daughters have all read and watched Harry Potter offerings.  I have not, yet.  However, I may have to after experiencing this excellent attraction.  Even though the lines were long due to popularity, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience."
Magical Place,Visited a few times with the family.  Never boring.  Love my visit every time.  Frozen Butter Beer is my favorite.
Very fun,Had a lot of fun. Crowded but very good rides. Hagrid ride was 90 minute wait. Others we used the express pass and very fun. Really liked forbidden Harry Potter ride.
Fantastic ,Loved the visit - long waits for the rides but you feel it‚Äôs amazing when you finally get on it - there Are very long waits but it soon moves
Worth going to and the family enjoyed the Express Pass,I can see why this area and rides are so popular even for those who have not read the books.  Find a less busy time to go.
THE BEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD,"Butterbeer is the greatest drink, I got it regular, frozen, and warm. I could drink 100000000. Every small detail you can think of, they've covered it. Live performances, special effects, etc. The rides were great, lines weren't too painful. Definitely crowded but no more than you would expect. Will absolutely be back."
Always lots of fun,Always have fun! The new Hagrid motorbike coaster is one of the best ever! Very busy and working the way through the strollers :)
Magic!!!,The attention to detail is second to none. Some of our favourite rides are the Harry Potter ones. Great to wander around Hogsmeade for a few hours with a butter beer or a pumpkin juice (or both!). We managed to catch the dark arts light show on the castle when we visited which was fantastic!!
Outrageous costs for souvenirs ,The swords were outrageous. You needed one to enjoy many of the parts of the park. Add this to the high costs of tickets and food. How can an average family afford this?
Got our HP on,"What can I say about Harry Potter world? Mind blowing. The detail, the rides, the stores, all are above expectations. We went for three days, saw new stuff every time we went from park to park. The crowds were huge, as expected, but they do a great job of moving the masses. Butter beer A+. The lines for the rides are daunting at times, but rest assured, they are worth it."
Wonderful!,"Must go there, you are really immersed in the World of Harry Potter and his friends! The Ollivanders wand shop is incredible, and so is other attractions: must go and see! You will enjoy!"
Magical really is the right word...,"We loved everything about the Wizarding World. My children - now 15 and 17 - grew up reading the books and watching the movies, so to say we are fans is probably an understatement. Universal did not disappoint. The views alone are just outstanding - the detail in each storefront in Hogsmeade and the castle looming over the village is unreal. Go to the rear patio at the Hog's Head Pub to get a fantastic view. And do not miss the details in Diagon Alley either. Explore every little nook and cranny. Another tip I would offer is to spend some time reading the Universal Informer and other chat boards and learn about the hidden treasures throughout the Wizarding World. There are people who visit regularly and they they are usually happy to share their finds with the greater community of readers. A wand is a MUST - we just had so much fun with wands. I cannot wait to return..."
Awesome,The Harry Potter are and rides are awesome. We really enjoyed this. Would recommend this to anyone. We had a much more enjoyable time here then at Disney.
Surpassed my expectations,I am a Harry Potter fan and was worried this place would be kitschy but I was wrong.  It is such a great experience for kids and adults alike.
Can't get enough of the details.,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will not be disappointed. It's awesome. We have been coming since it opened and it never gets old. Love Forbidden Journeyband the new Haggerds ride is the best!"
Worth the wait,"Do the big rides in the wizarding world of Harry Potter do seem overwhelming at first glance but let me tell you, they do not disappoint!"
Brilliant,"You don't have to be a Harry Potter expert to enjoy all of the attractions here, but if you are a fan, you will appreciate all of the brilliant detail that went into creating this place. We enjoyed travelling between parks on the Hogwarts express and experiencing Diagon Alley in the other park. Stan and the night bus were there too for plenty of memorable photos. Our favorite rides were Hagrid's motorbike and Escape from Gringotts."
Great place!,"Visited in February with children and grandchildren. We had a wonderful time. Park was crowded but well managed. The magic kept young and old mesmerized! Food prices were reasonable for an attraction and of good quantity. Bathrooms plentiful, normally clean and rarely a line. Shows were great for young and old. Great variety of rides and the child swap works great for all. Employees were very attentive, helpful and pleasant.  Much better than Disney parks ( sorry to betray Disney after 40 plus years)."
Uniquely designed,A very crowded area even in Feb. Fans loved it. Def go for the fast passes. The train is neat however you will need the Ultimate Fast Passes to ride it. Not really worth the extra cost in my opinion
Howarts so amazing,"You can travell to another magical world with a lot of things to do, this park is much better than disneyland. Congratulations for everyone"
"Great, even if you‚Äôre not a HP fan (like me)","Visited this attraction mainly cause wife and daughters are fans of Harry Potter. I‚Äôm the one who hardly knows names, locations, characters, etc. Anyway, we allhad a great time visiting this part of Universal Studios. Atmosphere, architecture and details are perfectly recreated. I honestly enjoyed it although didn‚Äôt bought a magic wand for usd60 (interactive ones were about usd 100). Highly recommended."
Busiest part of Universal. ,"This has to be the busiest part of the all parks, so be prepared to be knocked into by those not aware of their surroundings.Hagrids is always busy, and we found its queue to be quietest before close, and this is also the best time to ride, when it's dark. You won't be disappointed if you ride it in the dark.The middle part of the queue system also doesn't make sense, being packed into a room, after waiting in a queue, to watch a short 'safety' video, to be put back into a queue, in which time you may have lost your place to those unaware of their surroundings and have pushed to the front in the room.Hogwarts ride is good, we rode it many mnay times in the week. Amazing what coaster experiences are now, just brilliant.Be prepared to wait the longest for rides/experiences in WWHP."
Amazing area even if you are not a Harry Potter fan,This a brilliant area of the park. Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan it is still an amazing area of the park to visit. Love all the rides and all the theming. The staff are fun and friendly and are in character. Coming from England it almost feels like home from home. All the rides are amazing and the new Hagrid ride is a fantastic addition and certainly worth an hour wait.
Beautiful Area Of Universal - Harry Potter,Beautiful part of Universal and the rides are awesome.  3 Broomsticks has the best fish and chips and the butter beer is very good.
"Hogwarts, with sunshine","The perfect place for any Potter fan, the castle and Hogsmead look just like the films, Hogwarts express on display here, also Hogsmead station, where you board the train, for travel to London."
AMAZING! COMES CLOSE TO DESCRIBING OUR TRIP!,"We spent two amazing and memorable 3 days at Universal with our party of ten!! We had the privilege of skip the line because we stayed at the Best Hotel at Universal, Hard Rock Hotel !!! We hope to come back again and we would stay at Hard Rock Universal in a heartbeat!!! Hagrid‚Äôs ride and the Forbidden Journey were awesome!! The Hulk was the other favorite of our party.  We enjoyed all the other attractions such as Transformers, Minions, Men in Black, Rip Ride Rocket coaster, Spider-Man, The Hogwarts Express, Jimmy Fallon New York race, the Mummy, Ripsaw Falls, Flight of Hippogriff, Jurassic Park, King Kong, and. Popeye‚Äôs Bilge Rat Barges!!! So much fun for all ages!!!"
Business trip,"This is fantastic, puts you right into the atmosphere of harry potter.  Take a ride through Hogwarts, wander through the streets and shops, ride the dueling fire and ice rollercoaster, sit in the front seats and the end of the ride will blow you away.Howarts is simply spectacular, full size and as you wonder through it comes to life just as in the movies, extremely well done and you can pick up your favourite wand or other momentos, which are quite reasonably priced."
Great if you visit everything in the right order,"My girlfriend and I made the mistake of visiting Hogsmead first, and then Diagon Alley. DO NOT DO THAT. Visit Diagon Alley first, in the daytime, and then head to Hogsmead at night for the lightshow. If you do things in that order, it's 10/10. Hogsmead unfortunately has a lot of new construction happening nearby, and it breaks immersion to see it in daylight. Everything goes dark at night, however, and the shops all look just like what you'd expect. Oh, and I highly recommend Borgin & Burkes in Nocturn Alley. Great selection of spooky merchandise."
Great Place to bee Potterized,"This is a fantastic sensory experience for anyone who loves Harry Potter, with a multitude of things to do."
Magical,"Just brilliant, so well done and it feels amazing to be there.  The merchandise is brillaint too but a but pricey."
Omg !! Its like the real HP,"Everything is just so real! Like You really step Into the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The castle waiting line is like a trip through hogwarts. Seeing dumbledore's office. A classroom, the portret moving and talking. Gringrotts is also so real! I say everyone wit loves Harry Potter should go here. Diogonalley is also so real and omg the butterbeer is just so great!"
excellent!!,"oh my! as HUGE Harry Potter fans this was fantastic! I get motion/sea sick so was unable to ride the the castle journey and Hagrids motorbike, but the Escape from gringots was fun as was the hippogriff roller coaster. Gringots and everything else was just as seen in the movie. Really really great time in both Diagon alley and Hogsmeade."
Hogwarts is in Florida!,"What a great place! You really feel like you are in the books. The entrance is secluded, just like Hogwarts is and the whole feel is perfect! Try the Hot Butterbeer!"
Authentic Fun,Universal has outdone themselves with the development of the Harry Potter attractions. I was impressed by the realism of all the architecture. Every nook and cranny is covered in Harry Potter items. It was enjoyable to just walk and observe as others enjoyed their time. We didn‚Äôt do the thrill rides but most of the others. Just a great experience. Took us the better part of a day to see everything.
Best part of our trip,Loved every moment. Even just wandering around was magical. Went again a second time the next day. Worth visiting
our visit by Universal,very interesting trip in the universal. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a great event and make much fun. We hope we come soon back.
A Magical Experience ,"Universal has done such an amazing job with the two Harry Potter park areas. This is my second time there. The details are perfect and hard core fans will find so much to love. My husband, who puts up with my obsession with all things fantasy loves it too!We picked the perfect week to visit and practically had the park to ourselves. We chose the park to park option so we‚Äôre able to go between the two HP areas and that‚Äôs the only way to ride the train. So much fun to watch kids use their wands on the store windows. Things really move inside and you hear a tinkling sound üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have found that the Forbidden Journey still makes me a little sick. The ride this time got stuck during Quidditch and we were suspended for a bit. We didn‚Äôt get to ride Hagrids Motorbike as it wasn‚Äôt open until later in the afternoon, and then it had issues so the wait was too long."
Brilliant World of Magic brought to life,"Let me first annoy everyone first and say Harry Potter is overrated . . . . . I only watched all the films last year, they were ok to good. BUT, i must admit this place in Universal is brilliant recreated and great fun. My parnter is a big fan so she enjoyed it. The new Hagrid ride is brilliant and as a frequent goer to theme parks in Orlando, it's nice for a new attraction. All the HP attractions were very good, but the lines are abysmal but not much scan be done there. Food in was also loverly in the tavern with cooked chicken and ribs."
One of my favorite places in Universal Orlando!,"I found this themed area spanning two theme parks by far the best section of Universal Orlando! Between the rides, Hogwarts Express, Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, there is so much to see here that words don't do it any justice. Also, the ice cream was delicious!"
A different world,My son and I have been here multiple times and we love it!  The details are amazing!  You can buy an interactive wand and go around searching for areas the wand makes things happen. I great experience!
Kids and I loved it!,"We went in January and our wait time wasn't that long. It was so much fun, would definitely go back!"
Really cool but could be so much better,"The universal park is perplexing in that a huge part of  it consists of a simulated New York City and San Francisco. Not much to do there. As a fan of Harry Potter I would have preferred an expanded and more in-depth Diagon and Knockturn Alley. Walking in to it the first time is glorious. However the more time spent there the more you realize how limited it is. Gringotts is the most elaborate aspect with a wonderful ride. Highly recommend. Many of the stores however are just storefronts. The dragon over Gringotts is cool when it breathes fire (not working on the second day). The train to Islands of Adventure is awesome. (Also was not working on second day -‚Äúroutine maintenance ‚Äú. ). So here‚Äôs my question... if the Wizarding World is the biggest draw by far, why isn‚Äôt it bigger?  Early entrance consisted of almost all guests walking through the Universal Studios park, heading directly to Diagon Alley (long walk from the gates) past the simulated New York etc. In Wizarding World be prepared to spend tons of money. Programmed Wands are $40 and up. I saw many kids waving these wands at various programmed things (fountains, windows) that were difficult to activate. A few employees (not enough of them) showing kids how to wave wands correctly for the 10 second response. Try the ice cream parlor for butter beer ice cream and other eccentric flavors like chocolate chili. Leaky Cauldron is a must. Do the Gringotts ride first and hit the wand store ( both have very long lines as the day goes on). Also the train line gets very long. Ride the train back and forth in the morning to avoid the hour long line later. Outside of Diagon Alley the rides are old and outdated. Suess World is cool for really young kids. ET, Men in Black, the big Greek temple are tedious compared to the Gringotts ride. I hope the park makes improvements and adds more to Wizarding World Diagon Alley. It would be cool if there was a wizards show on the stage there with special effects, a spell battle etc instead of a weird, campy singer with three back up singers. Knockturn Alley has great ambiance (dark and spooky with a dark arts store) but is way too small. This entire area should be expanded with more elaborate elements. Given the hyper inflated prices in the Diagon Alley stores I think they could afford this. We went in January primarily to avoid the massive crowds in high attendance times and for cooler weather. 70 degrees F was perfect but was still crowded. I cannot imagine being there during high attendance times. The waste of time standing in lines would not be worth the expense. Here‚Äôs another question...universal park was only open from 8 AM to 7 PM in January. So at this expensive highly popular park, why couldn‚Äôt They have done maintenance on the train and the dragon during the many hours the park is closed overnight instead of during the day?  On to Islands of Adventure where you will find Hogsmeade. Stunning visual of Hogwarts castle and the greatest ride ever invented (forbidden journey). Flying through the air around Hogwarts is amazing. I want this ride at my house. The flying parts of this ride are epic but the intermittent parts that go inside Hogwarts are weird- more rudimentary. The town of Hogsmeade is cool. The roof tops and buildings are a masterpiece. Three broomsticks is a must of course. Pretty good food and excellent decor. However just like Diagon Alley in the other park, the more time you spend there the smaller it becomes. Again many storefronts (not actual experiences) and the stores have exorbitant prices. It was congested in the streets and stores. Again I cannot imagine being there during high attendance times and in the summer heat. And again there‚Äôs a weird show on the small stage with actors who look like they‚Äôre about to succumb to heat exhaustion. How about a quidditch demonstration instead or another wand battle or potions class etc?  The rest of Islands of Adventure is huge (long walks). And of course Hogsmeade is in the back of the park (like Diagon Alley in the other park) so if the train is not an option you will have to walk through the entirety of both parks to visit both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade ( which is a brilliant profit-making manipulation - must buy multiple park pass etc). Walking to the exit of Islands park takes about 20 minutes without small children or stopping along the way.  elements. Given the hyper inflated prices in the Diagon Alley stores I think they could afford this. We went in January primarily to avoid the massive crowds in high attendance times and for cooler weather. 70 degrees F was perfect but was still crowded.

Very realistic!!,When arriving at Universal Studios immediately go to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter! You won't want to leave.
Visited over New Years holiday,This place is amazing the buildings and affects were fantastic. Well worth the visit even though we were there over the New Years holiday. It was so busy to the point of dangerous at times being stuck in crowds wasn‚Äôt pleasant. The wait times for rides was too long.
Amazing !,"We went as a family trip all I can say it‚Äôs the best Universal Studio has. The wonderful world of Harry Potter. It made me feel in another world. It‚Äôs a little town with a castle , little shops , bricks streets, restaurants combine with the theme."
Great day,We didn't the day walking through the stores and riding the rides.  Really had an excellent time and enjoyed how well they built out everything.
Just like the movies,We walked in and WOW!!!  The details were amazing. Loved looking in all the shops and windows.  Plus the rides were awesome.  Only bad thing was that it is small so the crowds were very large.  A must see if you are a fan.  So many little things to see and it was amazing.
Epic place! Enjoyed this at 30 as much as I did when I was 10!,"Well where do I start? Orlando universe is just amazing!!! I‚Äôve been several times between 10-17 and managed to return last year with my kids, obviously with the new addition of Harry Potter wizarding world!  Well, I was in my element! Having read all the books and watched all the films, they‚Äôve really made this look and feel authentic (apart from the weather,  no dreary London weather, but I think diagon alley was perfect in 30c heat!).  The extra special bits were the butter beer, the real fire breathing dragon on gringotts bank & the interactive wands we bought in ollivanders.   They weren‚Äôt cheap ($55 each) but worked throughout the wizard of world and are a great gift to remember your visit!!!  We will be back, most definitely, in a few years once my husband forgot how much it cost to fly us all out to Florida üòÇ. No matter your age, if you like Harry Potter, you gotta go check this out!"
Fun afternoon,It is clever and beautiful and made me want to go back and read the book all over again. And the performers are really wonderful!
Ideal Get Away although I own a home in Orlando FL,Thsi was an EPIC Experience!!  Perfect 4 family funn.  MY 13 year old son was mesmorized.  I myself was in AWE.
"Exciting, it transports you to the world of Harry Potter, excellent organization with every detail, impeccable attention","Do not miss ANY activity. You are not going to get tired of walking because time goes by so fast how exciting it is. If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you can't miss it."
The Express Pass is not as good as it used to be,"We paid $580 at our hotel for 2 people/tickets (2 parks - 1 day) plus 2 Express lane passes.  The parks are a lot of fun, but the value of the Fast Pass has gotten much worse since I was there 2 years ago.  The early access you get from staying at a Universal resort was also a big disappointment.  You cannot get into Islands of Adventure early, only Universal Studios park is open at 8 AM, AND the only ride running that early was the Escape from Gringotts, which and we weren't even allowed to use our Fast Pass on Gringotts till after 9 AM when the park was open to everyone.  We were told the Hogwarts train would not run till 9:20, so it the early access was actually pointless and I would have rather slept-in another hour.  We were looking forward to the new Hagrid ride most of all, but they did not allow anyone to use a Fast Pass for this ride.  We ended up waiting about an hour to ride Hagrid's, which was still worth it.  We heard the ride could get up to a 3 hour wait time. Other than Harry Potter, the rest of the parks were pretty calm and average wait times were between 10-30 minutes.  Our group of 5 were able to get through both parks with our fast passes by 3 PM."
Amazing,"The Harry Potter experience was a very good surprise, having a lot of fun, so I will repeat the visit soon again."
Fun ride - worth the wait,"Great ride / experience for young and old alike.  Lots of speedy ups and downs, ins and outs... Great visual experience... Well worth the wait in line."
My Wife's happy place,"We first visited Orlando in 2013 as my Wife is a huge Harry Potter fan and has been for more than 20 years. She cries with joy on our first visit each trip and we always come back with the majority of our time spent at Hogsmeade / Diagon Alley exploring the shops, enjoying the rides and sampling the themed foods on offer (I recommend the peanut butter & strawberry Ice Cream from Florean Fortescue's in Diagon Alley. Hot Butterbeer is delicious in the winter months). It's immersive and extremely well done; always very busy but I've found February is the best for us - very warm but not too hot for us pasty white English folk, and if you can take the kids out of school you'll save a packet. Wait times are always lesser in February and you'll have the opportunity to see & do more. We've been home just a couple of weeks from our last trip as I write this post but the next adventure is already on the drawing board."
"Lots of walking, thank the Lord for my scooter, a blessed day.","Had a wonderful time with my Family.  The only ride I went on was my scooter, I just took the pictures."
Fantastic,There really are very few words. Amazing place Loved every minute of it. Queues for the rides are long but absolutely 100% worth every minute.We will be back
Cool visit,An absolutely blast hanging out here! It really feels like you're in the movie which as a harry potter fan it is amazing! Highly recommend it.
"Very Nice, but NOT Worth the Cost","We really enjoyed our visit, other than one of the rides not working.  The design is fantastic, everything is well done, and we enjoyed the rides we were able to go on.  However, for the cost of buying the two park tickets to see all of it, it was absolutely not worth it.  It's disappointing that Universal broke it up into the two parks which forces you to pay for both to be able to see everything.  Falling for it was a major mistake on our part."
Always love the visit to the wizard of workd,"What can I say, it‚Äôs HP fun! I love bringing people who have never been and watching their faces when you first step into Diagon Alley. It never gets old. February is a great time to visit. If you are an HP fan you will love the attention to detail. If you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôll still be whisked away by the magic of the place."
Love the new ride!,"This was the third time for us, having visited when Wizarding World first opened, then when Escape from Gringotts opened, so wanted to get back for Hagrids Motorcycle ride. Universal has done such a great job with Wizarding World. It is so immersive and the rides are outstanding. My favourite is still Forbidden Journey. Flight of the Hippogriff is fairly intense for a small coaster but very short. You need to have the Park to Park pass to ride Hogwart‚Äôs Express but it also lets you switch parks early to hit the big rides before the crowds get too big. We visited 2nd week in January and stayed at an on-site hotel so had one hour early admission to Universal Studios. We were able to almost walk onto Escape from Gringotts and get back on for 2 quick rides, then headed to Islands of Adventure for Hagrid‚Äôs Motorcycle before it got too busy. Next day we went to Islands of Adventure for opening and were able to walk onto Forbidden Journey back to back. Previously we have had Express passes but it wasn‚Äôt too busy this time, but I would stay at one of the deluxe hotels again next time to have the Express Pass."
Definitely must go!!,"Amazing ride, simulation of you flying through out the the castle and playing Quadriball with enemies chasing you!"
Best theme park!!,"Been to both sides of The Wizarding world of Harry Potter multiple times. They really knocked it out of the park on every level, rides are great, the setup is fantastic and the experience is a must for any fan !! Best theme park out there!"
Amazing to be able to walk around in my favorite story!,"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was amazing. Harry Potter is one of my all-time favorite stories, and being able to walk through it was surreal. Every time I walked past Hogwarts, I couldn't stop staring at it. Just beautiful. My boyfriend and I loved the Gringotts ride, the Forbidden Journey ride through Hogwarts, and Hagrid's new ride. Here is my takeaway:1.) We did not have an express pass or anything, and never had an issue getting through the lines, but I will say we did go at the end of January when it's not as busy. The line for Hagrid's ride said 90 minutes, but we did the ""single rider"" line and were literally in and out in exactly 40 minutes. (Quick note: if you are claustrophobic, there is a point in the single rider line where you are in this very tight stairwell that leads down into a larger area. I began to panic a bit, but when the line stopped I just sat on the stairs and that helped. I imagine during the summer when it's hot, it can feel very uncomfortable in there.) 2.) We ate at The Leaky Cauldron and Three Broomsticks. Neat experience, but very expensive. A frozen Butterbeer is $8.00. And the food was sub par. You are really just paying for the experience, and to me it was worth it. Also - Butterbeer is DELICIOUS.3.) I went into Ollivanders 3 times to seek out a wand.It is such a teeny, tiny store and there were people packed inside. I didn't want a wand that was interactive, but that is what 90% of their wands are now. At $55, I couldn't justify it so I went over to the Weasley store and got a Pygmy Puff.4.) Hogwarts Express - *sigh* This was a little disappointing. I thought we would look out the window and be able to see Hogwarts, etc. but it's a screen. The room is a bit tight and uncomfortable and a little awkward being so close to strangers. I was claustrophobic in there simply because you couldn't actually see out. Just looking at the screen. Thankfully it's not a long journey. 5.) The dragon was so cool! But man - if you aren't expecting or ready for the fire coming out of his mouth, be prepared to pee your pants. (Just kidding - kind of.) He supposedly does it every 10 minutes and starts to growl beforehand. 6.) Wasn't a huge fan of the cost of things. I was expecting it, but was still shocked to see a chocolate frog costing so much money ($12 I believe). I bought a Pygmy Puff, a Pygmy Puff night shirt and a Dark Mark sucker and it cost $62.00. Yikes. But, AGAIN, it's all about the experience and purchasing what is important to you.7.) The locker room situation seems... not great. My boyfriend had to put his backpack into a locker before each ride and it was just a chaotic mess inside the room. They have people standing guard telling folks only one person per party can go in. This is not super effective because there are just SO MANY people walking in and out. I saw one worker actually get mad at 2 girls trying to go in at the same time, so I think a better system needs to be worked out.8.) Back to the rides - this little fact should probably be made known to riders BEFORE they get in line. The 3 main rides never stop moving. You have to get onto a moving platform (think, flat escalator) and try to hop into your seat that is ALSO MOVING. I hesitated for like 2 seconds and had to run to get into my seat. So PAY ATTENTION when you are getting close to being next. I am fairly nimble and can move quickly, but I can imagine someone older or who doesn't have very good mobility having issues with this.Overall, this is totally worth it if you are a HP fan. Absolutely. Hagrid's ride was one of the coolest roller coasters I've ever been on. Just be prepared for lots of people, and lots of high-cost items. The only other thing I wish had been there were the book characters - I figured I would maybe see someone dressed as HP, or Snape, or Dumbledore. But nope. Kind of disappointing. But still a really cool experience."
One of the best themed experiences ,"We loved this part of the park. I understand why disney freaked when Universal opened this. They did such a great job theming the land so it really feels like you are part of the books/movies.  The small details like the advertisements on the side of the shops, the city sounds, the wizard radio broadcast make it come to life. Th Hogwarts Express to hogsmead was brilliant. A must visit in Orlando."
Best family vacation,We visited Universal Studios Florida in July 2019 and our family loved it! We lived it so much we are planning another trip to go back this summer.
Hagrid ,Hagrid- Great new ride.....when it is operational. We rode it the first of our three days at the Universal Parks and thank goodness we did because it was shut down the entire next day. We stayed at Hard Rock Hotel on-site and I would definitely recommend that as well to get fast passes for all of the other rides.
Nice to see it,"Its more for a young generations. But what i liked it was a 3D show . It was really so amazing, and so real. If you go there 3D is the best oneüëè"
"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando, FL","Universal has done an outstanding job of recreating Harry Potter's World. Every detail is true to the novels and movies.  When Universal has Harry Potter weekends, stars from the movies make appearances.  You feel you've been transported to Hogsmead itself, where you can enjoy butterbeer and pumpkin juice an many other favorites from the series.  The wand shop is a fun stop where your wand can choose you. On the Studios side, check out Diagon Alley for the darker side of the  two lands.Visit the Goblins bank for some fantastic animatronics .  With a two park ticket youi can ride the train from Islands of Adventure to Universal Studios and back again. It is a different ride each way."
Loved it!,"This was our second visit and we still enjoy this park.  Much, much better than Magic Kingdom!  We went in January and skipped the crowds.  I think our longest wait time for a ride was twenty minutes."
Very realistic and well done! Need tickets to both parks if you'd like to see all of Harry Potter worlds.,"They did a fantastic job making this very realistic and fun! Felt like we were definitely in wizarding world. If you want to see all of Harry Potter at Universal, you'll need to buy tickets for both parks (and that's the only way to ride the Hogwarts Express). Makes it very expensive, but we felt it was worth it after having enjoyed it."
Hagrid is the winner ,Husband and kids are huge Harry Potter fans so they loved it all. Family voted the Hagrid bike ride their favorite ride of our entire Florida trip. Easy to navigate and places to sit and rest while others go check out stores and do rides.
Magical,"Spend time looking at all of the details (vanishing cabinet in knockturn alley, candy types in weasleys). Consume butter beer in all forms (hot, cold, ice cream). Get the two parks pass and ride between hogs mead and Diagon alley. You really can‚Äôt go wrong in this part of the park. If you have little interest in Harry Potter you will still enjoy."
Excellent Rides and Drinks ,"My wife and I spent a lot of time in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter on our recent trip to Universal. The buildings and architecture are very well done and so immersive. The rides are excellent though plan to wait a while as they have long lines. We rode The Forbidden Journey, Escape from Gringotts, and the Hogwarts Train between the two parks. The lines for other rides like Hagrid‚Äôa Motorbikes were just too long for us to wait in. I did greatly enjoy some butterbeer. It‚Äôs basically a butterscotch cream soda. Aside from the crowds, we really enjoyed the area and rides."
Absolutely Magical!,"We brought our Harry Potter obsessed 10 yr old and it exceeded our expectations!  The attention to detail is astonishing.  Hagrid's Ride was so much fun, as was Forbidden Journey and Escape from Gringotts.  I deducted a star due to parking prices... We spent the equivalent of $1500 CAD for a 5 day 3 park pass, so spending an addition $26 USD per day to park seems unfair."
Fabulous ,"Visited for second time on annual pass, loved it. Hagrids ride is amazing, fast, exciting, we did it 3x in one day! Queueing system quite good, so you never see the whole queue, or you might be put off.The whole WWHP is fabulous,  still love the original HP ride, well designed. We also loved Diagon alley, well worth a visit and escape from gringotts is a good ride too."
A must see for sure,"While we weren't sure on other places to visit in Orlando did a quick TripAdvisor search and this came up, we were able to find this place and it was mind blowing. Only thing is here it is much busier than most other places so avoid those rush times, you can use Google place tool to see what are the busiest hours and must do if you are a Harry Potter fan."
Stunning and impressive!,"If you have wondered what all the hype was about or whether this attraction lives up to the hype, the answer is YES! I am not as big a Potter-phile as others and I got a lot out of it. The immersive, interactive experience includes park workers who stay in character, making the visit all the more fun."
A must visit!,"You can't go to Orlando without visiting!! If you can visit during slower hours, there is so much to see. This is a must do for any Harry Potter fan."
Great,"As you would expect it is amazing, but it is very hard to get anywhere it was slammed all the time which was very disappointing you just got pushed along with the crowd."
Loved!,We had the best time!  Harry Potter was amazing.  We rope dropped Hagrids!  We rode all rides and did Ollivanders by 936am!
You NEED to visit this place!,"When we visited here we were amazed!! Walking around made us feel like children again as it is so magical! Me and my boyfriend came here in the summer and cannot wait to go again. Before we came we weren't Harry Potter fans in the slightest but since coming here it made us obsessed!! If you are a harry potter fan you MUST go and even if youre not, it will convert you!! Brilliant for families and couples."
Potter!!!!!!,This was the most amazing part of the park! Even with the crowds you felt like you just stepped into another world. The rides were amazing and they definitely go out of their way to maintain the atmosphere.
A must see,This was a lot of fun and the reason we went to FL. There a lot of details and so much to see. Great for most ages.
Fun!,"If you‚Äôre a fan of the books or movies, you have to go! So well done. Loved every minute. Do yourself a favor and spring for the express pass so you don‚Äôt have to wait in line."
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"Took advantage of the early morning access pass to WWoHP, sooooo worth it!!! a chance to get pic's and nose around before the rush, although it was feb and was quiet!Had breakfast in the hogs head part of the three broomsticks and sat outside the back - admittedly it was the worlds WORST porrige, but nonetheless it was lovely pastries, toasts, jams and marmalades, tea and coffee"
Fun,"Very well built with lots of attention to details. Fun to walk around and see shows.  Rides are fun, but can give you motion sickness.  Butterbeer was good.  Go to that area during the early opening hour.  It was much more enjoyable; less crowds."
Time of my life,Can't wait to go again and spend another magical time.  If you are visiting be sure to acknowledge other guests and show manners that we all know you were taught.  We all go to spend the day full of fun and spend the same money to be at the park.  Lets keep it clean together and not stop directly in front of people.
A magical place!,"We adored everything about this area in Island of Adventure. Hagrid‚Äôs Motorbike ride is a blast, the shows are fun, Hogwart‚Äôs is stunning, the Three Broomsticks was very good, and the Hogwart‚Äôs Express was fantastic. Be sure to ride Hogwart‚Äôs Express both ways!The atmosphere is so realistic, the shoppes are cute and the butter beer is delicious in any form. Try the Pumpkin juice, too!"
Outstanding rides,The 3D ride is an absolute must but not for anyone who gets motion sick. It's an absolutely amzing ride but if you have serious aches and pain you should avoid it
Pretty cool,"I‚Äôm a huge Harry Potter fan, and I‚Äôve been to the studio in London, and I still thought this place was awesome. The new Hagrid‚Äôs coaster is AWESOME. Try the butter beer ice cream. There is a laser light show on the castle in the evening. See it at least once!"
Bruh,Bruh. I waited two hours for this ride and had to leave. I woke up early to run to this ride. The messages kept getting more ominous. Eventually they encouraged us to leave. Like come on man they had hours to make sure the ride was working! Ruined my whole dayüò°. I‚Äôm not going on this ride until I can use express.
Excellent,What a fantastic set up - I am not a huge harry potter fan but really thought Universal studios had done this so well - we saw people eating massive turkey legs (themed food!) - the rides are great.  fantastic
Don't miss this even if you're not a Harry Potter devotee,"If you're an HP fan, this is a MUST.  If you just know enough about Harry Potter to be dangerous and maybe have seen one or two of the films, this will still impress.  It is amazing.  I would heartily recommend upgrading to the express option, and I'd say it's a requirement if your visit is on or during a school holiday.  If you're two or more, go for the express upgrade. If just single or alone, I fell as though you can avoid the express package charge by always using the ""single rider"" lines.  This saves an enormous amount of time vs. the regular lines."
Wonderful,As Seniors we did not go on any of teh ridesw but we found it fascinating nevertheless although pricey!
Wonderful Experience for all Potter fans,"This was an experience that you can't miss, I strongly recommend having the multiple park ticket so you can go on the Hogwarts Express. The stores in both parks are the best. And you have to try the butter beer, you'll fall in love with it."
"Fun,Fun,Fun","We had a great time here, not too crowed and lots of attractions, I really enjoyed the Hogg Warts Train ride.The rides in general are worth waiting for and lots of shops with wizarding memorabilia.Tickets for Universal studios Orlando area a reasonable price and plenty of on or near by hotels"
Awesome visit - try the Hot Butter Beer!!!,"We had a great time, the attention to detail is incredible.   You must tryHot Butter Beer it is really good ( but very sweet), the pumpkin juice is very good as well.   There is so much to see and do.   It‚Äôs a great time if you‚Äôve read the books or not, make some time to watch the side shows they are really good especially he choir."
An absolute must for Potter fans & muggles alike.,"This place takes you right into the pages of any Potter book, it really does NOT disappoint from Kings Cross to Hogsmeade to Diagon Alley there are things to look at everywhere."
Magical but Crowded,"I was really looking forward to visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and it was an amazing experience. I was however a little bummed by how crowded it seemed to be day in and day out. We unfortunately traveled at peak season but even after the hustle and bustle of the Holidays it never seemed to settle down. Even with early admission everyone flocked to booth of the Wizarding Worlds first thing These spaces (diagon alley, hogsmeade) are designed to be small and cozy, like in the books/movies, but it definitely adds to the crowded feeling when walking around. I purchased a wand that I struggled to enjoy with the mass crowds of people. There were lines at nearly all of the spell casting locations and if you didn't get your spell right off you felt rushed to get it right or move out of the way for the next person. As an adult, you felt almost awkward if there was a child waiting behind you. You just wanted to let all the kids go first before giving up cause you'd never cast a spell. I think I got to attempt... maybe 4 or 5? between both of the parks.I think there is 9 spell at EACH park. So I really missed out on a lot of them for a $60 wand.The Butterbeer was definitely worth getting. The cream was quite delicious, where the soda was somewhat comparable to a less sweet cream soda. I didn't have the Icee/Blended. I only tried regular.Hagrid's Magical Creatures: is amazing. It is a roller coaster, but don't worry nothing too intense that someone on the fence about coasters couldn't handle. There are no loops, nothing upside down, just a few dramatic turns and drops with some backwards motions. The wait time on this ride is absolutely ridiculous and Universal needs to figure it out because the average wait time while I was there was over 200 minutes. The express pass, sadly, does not work for this ride.Forbidden Journey: I was pleasantly surprised by this ride. It's a 3d mini coaster is the best way to describe it. There are a few scary drops but otherwise mostly 3d visuals but an amazing ride. If the wait time wasn't so long, I'd have gone on it a few times but unfortunately all the Harry Potter ride had excessive wait times."
Such a Magical place to be!!!!!!,"I recommend this place! I got to go on all the rides, drink butter beer, and bought a wand so i can do magic the whole day! My family, friends, and I had so much fun! This  place We definitely are going to do it again!"
Hagrids ride is the best.,"We have been annual pass holders to universal for the past 5 years.  We obviously love the place and particularly Harry Potter‚Äôs world.  We live in Florida and try to go 3-4 times a year.  We used to be able to go in January and have some reprieve from the tourist crowds.  No more.  We are on our way home now and while we did manage to do most of the rides (express passes of course) the Hagrids ride was a 70 minute wait.  We tried several times over 3 days to get on with shorter wait time but could not.  The line is frustrating because people walk by (in the single rider line) when the single rider line is not open.  We asked if we could go single rider and were told no several times throughout the line.  When we finally reached the front of the line we found a single rider line up!?!?  Many people waiting in line were frustrated,  need to work on that universal!  Need to entertain more in this line, offer water, have a bathroom accessible, show Harry Potter videos -do more.  Also was disappointed with the locker fee, really!?!  $300 tickets and you charge for lockers to go on rides?  Anyway hagrids IS an awesome ride but will NEVER wait that long again.  Hopefully universal will figure it out."
Brilliant new Ride,"We have done the new Hagred Motor Bike Ride several  times and it is really great. The wait times can be long and there is no opportunity to fastpass or express pass the lines at this time. So, get there about 30 mins before park closing to avoid the longest wait times. We managed to get on this ride within 45 mins twice this month. It is also great fun in the dark!"
Fabulous place.,What a great place. If you like Harry Potter then this is a must for you. The escape from Gringots ride and the Hagrid ride were excellent.
Wizarding holiday magic,"I wasn't a huge fan... Until I went here.. if you think magic kingdom is magic this is magic squared!! The detail is absolutely incredible... Lose yourself with your kids in wizarding frolic! If you can manage to not waste too much time standing in lines there is so much to see! If you've read the books you've got to check out the detail!  Snacks? Healthy options! I was pleasantly surprised... Get yourself some fudge..Oh... And don't miss the butterbeer... Iced, hot, and regular ü•∞"
Simply stunning.,Simply stunning...the work gone into this to make it feel lime the actually town in Harry Potter is amazing.Lots of great shops...great ride and a must for any Harry Potter fan really.
Girls trip,I have been about 9 years ago when HP was only in one park. The addition of Diagon Alley was totally worth this trip. A lot of effort was put into making this a childhood come to life. I was so happy. The park hopper pass is the only way to get on the Hogwarts express.Totally take the time to look around and pop into every shop.
Well worth it,We went to Universal primarily to see Harry Potter. It was amazing and well done. Of course we explored the shops and bought a wand. Just walking around is a huge part of the experience. We also did most of the rides (Hagrid had a long line and most of my party is not into coasters). Also eat at the Leaky Cauldron for the experience.
Amazing,"Was brilliant in there, lots of interactive things to do. The butter beer was icing to the cake. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be."
Fun,If your a fan of Harry Potter it is a great place.  Love the interactive wands people had.  Like going back in time.
Love this place!,"This is not my first time here, I've been here a few times and my wife and I love it! We are big Harry Potter fans so coming here is always magical for us. Only down side for us was that hagrids motorbike adventure did not use the express pass yet and being there on January 2nd, the wait times were insane! Hagrids had a 390 minute wait time at 9:15am. The lowest it got down to all day was 240 minutes. Needless to say we didn't get to ride it but we did everything else multiple times. Make sure when you go you watch the shows and try the butterbeer!"
Magical ,"How can you not love this place the effort put in here is amazing, love the butter beer and all the food, rides and entertainment brillant"
Motorbikes were a Highlight,"Very cool world. We know nothing about Harry Potter but it seemed to be well done. It is very busy though and there were big crowds even in the off season.Hagrid‚Äôs Motorbike ride- Definitely the best ride and worth the wait. Really fun. Some unique surprises. It is a relatively smooth rollercoaster. Does not go upside down.The nice thing is that the actual wait time was often shorter than the posted wait time. Some reviews say to arrive early to the park to minimize wait times. We went Jan 8-11th which was a quieter time in the park so this comment may not be accurate for all times of the year but‚Ä¶ we found that going to the park early to get in line for the ride was no faster than waiting at any other time in the day, especially if you account for the long line up at the park entrance at opening time. Each time we waited approximately 50 minutes in the ride lineup regardless of the posted wait time of 90 min or 120 min, morning, late morning or evening. The single rider line for this ride went really slow compared to other rides with very fast moving and short single rider lines. Note that the single rider line was also not always open. Note that express passes are not currently available for this ride.This ride malfunctions often and delays and closures are frequent; therefore to ensure you get to go on this ride, then it is best to go early in the day in case it closes and you don't get to ride it."
Never disappointed at WWHP,"This is the 4th or 5th time we have visited. Always amazed. Download the Universal app for wait times. The new Hager‚Äôs ride has super long wait times. We saw as high as 360 minute. Luckily we got there with a 90 minute wait. It moves but the wait time is true. So worth the wait. Best ride of my life. Will make you want to get back in line, we almost did but then it was back up to 120-150 so we moved on."
Worth the trip!,Been dreaming of seeing this for years and it did not disappoint.  It is entirely beautiful and the frozen butter beer was great.  The ride inside Hogwarts castle was not worth the wait in line only because the screen to see the virtual reality was blurry - not realistic.
Hagrid's Magical Creatures Ride,"Best ride at both of Universal's parks.  Offering advice on how to actually get on this ride without waiting for hours.  Line up at Island of Adventure entrance nlt 8 o'clock, yes, that's an hour prior to gates opening.  Be advised that the gates usually open 15 to 20 minutes early.  Upon admission, walk briskly (my family did a light jog) to the attraction- park employees provide excellent direction.  No back-packs or loose articles are permitted so you will need to use a locker- do so quickly!  Should have less then a half hour wait if you follow these simple instructions.  Make this ride your priority otherwise you will have to wait for hours to ride during the day.  If you have early admission to Universal Studios because you are a resort guest, do NOT try and ride the Hogwarts Express over to Hogsmeade from Diagon Alley- you will arrive too late and your wait will be extensive!!  Good luck and enjoy!!"
INCREDIBLE!,You actually feel like you are in the movies and books. I absolutely recommend this to anyone fans or not of the series!
I will come back,"There was so much to explore and we really enjoyed the immersive experience. There were some emotional tears of joy involved, as well as giddy excitement. I know I didn‚Äôt get to see it all and will have to come back to see it again. The quality of the reproduction was top notch, from architecture, to costumes and atmosphere it had it all. By far this is the reason to come to Universal. Definitely a highlight of our trip."
Harry!!!!!!,"Here we are again.. Whoa hoooooo. My son and I love it here. To say we love it here is an under statement. We saw the queue at 3.5 hours for Hagrids but we were through in 2 hours, managed to get on it a few times, it's fantastic and so fast....... The train was great, its brill especially for all us Harry fans.It was my partners first time here and he loved it, his favourite being Forbidden journey, he's not a ride lover before this holiday but he is now üòçEscape From The Gringotts was brill, walking through the bank and through the corridors really pull you in but you can also shoot down the single rider line where you miss most of it but gets you through alot quicker and we still sat together.  If you love Harry, you'll love it here‚ù§‚ù§"
Harry potter,"Love it, but the prices have gone up so much I paid $18 for example Christmas decoration featuring the Harry potter train and it's gone up like $6  in the last two years I don't know how family's pay for it I can just about afford it by getting a second job plus everything I would recommend taking bottled water or better a reusable bottle and just fill it up."
One of my favs!,Express pass is worth it. Save the long line ups.  Loved this ride. Would do it all over again! NO glasses required and its in 3D.
Incredibly Authentic,It really does feel as though you are in Harry Potter's World. Frozen Butter Beer is amazing and the Hogwart's Express was fantastic. Even just walking around is an experience.
So awesome and yet... ,"I‚Äôm a big Harry Potter nerd. It‚Äôs the whole reason we went to Orlando, and we allocated an entire day to spend just doing the Harry Potter experience. The atmosphere was amazing, and the attention to detail was fantastic. It really made you feel like you stepped into that world. That being said, it was so crowded (even in the supposed downtime) that it was hard to really do anything. Also, being a plus sized girl meant that I was unable to do either the castle ride or the Hagrid ride although I was able to to the Gringott‚Äôs ride (which was fantastic ). I wish they had some sort of statement on the website or somewhere in conjunction with this that would have let us know that at a certain size you might not be able to ride. That was a lot of money to spend to not be able to ride 2 of the three main rides (not really counting the train as a ride although it was neat). We had the frozen butterbeer which was super tasty. We had lunch at the three broomsticks. The fish and chips were excellent, but I believe the food was overpriced. The Ollivander‚Äôs wand experience was fun to participate in. I purchased a wand and robes, and I loved all of the shops. My favorite part was probably Knockturn Alley. We also tried the fun ice cream flavors in Diagonal Alley ‚Äî lavender and earl grey was unusual but good. It would have been nice to be able to sample first to make sure we liked the flavors before purchasing. The fire breathing dragon was fun to see. All of the people we interacted with were wonderful‚Äîvery helpful and accommodating. We purchased some shirts and things that they moved to the front to hold for us which was very handy. I really enjoyed interacting with the conductor. We had fun watching the tales of Beedle the Bard, and I liked the choir."
Fast Pass nonsense,Waiting in a line for 2 hours for Gringotts only to watch the fast pass line clear out 6 times to your 1. Could've done more with Harry Potter other than just shops. Not experience warranting over $100  admittance fees for one park.
GREAT HARRY POTTER EXPERINCE,bring your wand and cape this is the best H.P. experience you can have. the line through the castle is as good as the ride and the ride is alsum
A Great Experience ,"It was a great experience, and it‚Äôs the reason, I wanted to go to Universal Studios.  I would consider myself a Harry Potter snob, so how I envision this magical world was different, but it was well done.  The food, the rides, and the shops.  You literally could replay one passage from each of the books.  It was really nice.  My boys actually wanted to read the books after visiting.  When my son tried the boogie jellybean, and made a face.  I laughed and said if you had read the book you would have known not to try that one...  The prices are reasonable and there is an a good balance of quality and quantity.  When I do this trip again.  I‚Äôll just go for two days but get the express pass, because the lines for HP are always long..."
A spectacular experience!,An amazingly designed theme park! Astonishing attention to details! Makes you feel you are part of the Harry Potter world! Highly recommended!! Will definitely visit again!
J K Rowlings did it right!,Like seeing your self in a Harry Potter movie. From the experience of  butterbeer to craning your neck to take In the architectural accomplishments yet remember you are in Universal Studios. Totally awesome....and this is from a sr citizen  pov.
Great!,"To me, this was the main reason for visiting Universal. Make sure you get the park to park ticket so you can ride the train between the 2 Harry Potter sections. Be sure to drink the hot butter beer drink - tastes like butterscotch and is delicious. The butter beer ice cream is good too but the drink is better. Saw the light show at night. It's good but be prepared for crowds.Do the Harry Potter sections first before they get crowded.Also enjoyed Kong and Spider-Man. The safari boat ride was stupid. We should have skipped that one."
Best attraction,"My advice would be running to Harry Potter attractions once you are at the park, if you wanna skip the crowd (It has worked for me 4 years in a row). One of the best attractions, and specially during christmas eve when Hogsmeade looks beautiful but really crowded. At nights there‚Äôs a christmas show at Hogwarts, I would recommend being there about 1-1:30hr in advance to get a great spotYou wont regret taking the Hogwarts express üöÇ"
Omg!!!! Amazing,A must do!!! Everything was great. And super fun. I recommend buying an interactive wand it was so much fun wandering around and testing the spells.
Loved it.,Have been to Los Angeles as well and found them equally enjoyable. Lovely to be here at Christmas time with all the lights and decorations.
Loved the holiday light show!,"We always love visiting the World of Harry Potter and have a wonderful time everytime.  But this time we saw the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle (holiday) and it was AMAZING!!!  It‚Äôs seasonal and I don‚Äôt know specific dates, but definitely a must-see for any fan!"
The Magic is real,So I would like to start out with saying I am a Potter nerd. But I have only read on the books not seeing the movies. Either way this place was awesome. There is no getting around the craftsmanship and detail that went into the parks. My son and I hit every potter-themed ride and then some and had an awesome time doing it. The only advice I could give is if it's going to be a busy time of year Fork out the cash for the express pass. That cut are waits in line in half.
Converted to a Harry Potter Fan!,"Okay Harry Potter fans, don't hate me but I have never really been a big fan of the movies (probably had all of them on in the background over the years but never really got into it) and never read any of the books. However, having visited ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" twice now I'm a convert! The attention to detail, atmosphere, rides, and especially the ""Butter Beer"" are off the scale! I absolutely love the place and I can only imagine what it must be like for hardcore HP fans - Simply awesome 10/10 and I will be back!"
Magic! It's real life in the movie,"Every moment of Harry Potter is worth the entire trip to Universal. The wait time for Hagrid is long, but get in line and wait! It's the best!! You will not be disappointed by this adventure. All you heart can imagine has come to life in this section of the parks!  Immerse yourself in it, look for the obvious and the little things too. Don't rush"
"Crowded, but there is a reason why!","Hate to bash Disney but Hagred's Motorbike Adventure shows what can be, instead of what once was. The ride is amazing. Harry Potter's world is incredibly clean and new and bright."
Amazing holiday,"The best part of Orlando, far surpasses anything Disney has. You feel like you‚Äôre in the books and movies!!"
Awesome park with giant crowds,"The world of Harry Potter has been recreated perfectly.  The castle looks awesome, and the light show is great fun.Now for the down side.  The crowds, and lines, can be crazy.  I recommend spending the extra for the express ticket to give yourself a fighting chance.  If not, you will wasted hours of your day standing in lines for the attractions.The line for Hagrid's Adventure ride was between 4 and 5 hours all day.  And they do not accept the express pass as of Jan 1, 2020.Food is typical of any amusement park.  That meant be prepared to spend three to four times what you would on the outside.The rides are cool, and very modern, combining video simulation with mechanical items to create a great experience."
A-MAZ-ING,Wow! Just WOW! Loved it. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and this did not disappoint. Great details and a real feel of being in Diagon Alley. My son loved the interact wand features. Very busy and long queues but i didn't really expect anything else.
Very Wizarding!,"The area is really very well designed, just like in the movie. It really give you the feeling of coming to another fantasy place, plus the $$$. There are people using wand performing ""magic"" and wearing their robes, unfortunately they are very expensive. So we did not bought any of the harry potter stuff here, but coming here is really something already and totally worth the time and the entrance ticket. Love this place."
Magical Harry Potter,"Absolutely brilliant. Everything is perfect. Oldies and the youngest will thoroughly enjoy strolling the shop fronts in Diagon Alley then boarding the Hogswarts Express to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. So much to take in, you have to go more than once. If you loved the books and movies this is the place to embrace.Visit at night for the laser show over the castle.Yes, the pesky crowds do hinder your progress but this is true for all of the parks. Waiting in long queues (lines) is part of the day but buy your wands and chocolate toads from Diagon Alley and take in the shows. Eat delicious food and buy your Harry Potter butterbeer. Will definitely return here. Well done Universal Studios."
Love the Wizarding World!,We managed to ride Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure twice in one day! You must have a park to park ticket to ride Hogwart's Express.  The area around Hogwart's can get very congested and best to avoid unless early or late!
The New Best Castle,The ride is very good. The way that they display the castle for the holidays was better then the Magic Kingdom.
Makes you feel like you‚Äôre in the movie,"Went here with my wife and 2 sons, ages 13 and 15. This was the perfect age for my kids. Universal‚Äôs attention to detail at both Harry Potter cities in the 2 parks was really unbelievable. It‚Äôs really cool to just walk around and look. You really feel like you‚Äôre in the movies. I also highly recommend a frozen butterbeer, but make sure to get your own. There is NO alcohol in butterbeer, and it‚Äôs delicious! Also, the Harry Potter rides really are some of the coolest rides at the park. Have fun!"
Christmas Day in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter,This was our Christmas gift to our kids this year! They read the books and watched the Harry Potter movies! It was really fun for them! We bought the 3 Park 2 day passes so that we could ride the Hogwarts Express to go between parks and have enough time to make sure we could get on Hagrid‚Äôs Motorbike ride and Gringott‚Äôs Bank ride. I have two teenagers and two small kids so my teenagers waited in line for the rides while I took the little ones around Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade Village so they can do spells with their wands from Olivander‚Äôs. The Hogwarts Castle light show and fireworks was also fun to watch at night! My small ones especially loved riding on the Hogwarts Express! On Christmas Day is was pretty crowded so I would suggest if you go on a holiday to try to get there as early as possible. We got there as soon as it opened and we were still able to enjoy the rides and activities!
First time at Universal ,Made our first trip to Universal and we loved the Wizarding World of Harry Potter! Diagon alley is so realistic and spot on! Butter beer hot and cold are must have! Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are also great but Diagon alley was our favorite. Enjoyed most of the rides but the simulators are not our favorite.
A must for a Harry Potter Fan,"This place is amazing and even more amazing if you love Harry Potter.It is busy and the ride times are long, but they;re worth it. The Hagrid Motorcycle is worth the wait  - it is intense, fun and left our heads spinning! By far the best ride of our trip. Harry Potter's Forbidden Journey and Escape from Gringotts are also amazing rides. Not just the rides but the whole journey into the ride, there's something to see the whole way along. The shops sell everything a Harry Potter fan could want.Ride the Hogwarts Express for added magic. It really is a magical place to visit."
