A Must Visit,"Other than wildlife such as kangaroos, wombats, etc, there are also many viewing points on this island. Such as the fossil Cliffs. There are also Tasmania Devil's here but they only come out at night and/or stay away from human so it is not easy to spot them. It's probably easier to spot leopard in a safari. Nonetheless, loved all the nature that this island offers."
"Great day, well worth it","We did a day trip from Triabunna and hired bikes.The ferry trip was pleasant and then we had a great day exploring the painted cliffs (before the tide comes in), fossils cliffs and the history and scenery.Wombats are in abundance.Make sure you bring food and water, as there is nothing to purchase on island.Would love to stay a few days camping or in the old bunk rooms."
Well...there is not so much to say about it....,"If you like walks, wildlife, historic sites and / or nature in general, Maria Island is of course a place you should visit. Tasmania itself is a beautiful, impressive island, and Maria Island seems to be a smaller version of it, where Mother Nature squeezed all her wonders in a smaller, more compact version. Walks of many diffrent grades with impressive coastal views and beaches (and / or mountains), bike rental (or bring your own), swimming, wildlife watching, there are so many options you can chose from, that a one day trip (which is actually only a few hours) will only scratch the surface of what MI has to offer. The only recommendation i could give: stay overnight and take your time! Walk around the airfield-meadows during sunset and enjoy the real beauty of the Island with less tourists and more wildlife, after the last ferry has left. Sitting there among Roos and Wombats and watching the sunset in silence is truly a priceless experience. And especially after dark you may hear some strange growlings across the island...for staying overnight I personally would prefer the campground over the convict-building, just because of the wild, nocturnal visitors that my be around then and being closer to nature, anyway...but stow away your foods and rubbish in the bins provided, there are many curious Possums and Pademelons around at the campsite. Or other creatures. The facilities there make it easier to stay a night or two. Or even more. You could also camp in a more remote area at French Farm, to have even more privacy. Luckily, there are no shops (yet) on MI, so bring your own supplies with you and be aware, that you have to take all your rubbish back with you as there is no disposal facility on the island. And do not expect to find a stable phone coverage or even data-able connection there.Overall, MI is truly amazing and i give a full recommendation for all nature lovers.The only thing i would wish is, that the Tassie Government would strictly limit / reduce the amount of daily / and overnight visitors. Also the behaviour of some ""special"" visitors should be monitored much stricter and also be fined easier (chasing animals with selfie sticks etc.). You can get nice pictures by approaching quietly and gently to the wildlife, without scaring or cornering them.  If you behave correctly, they will most probably let you come close enough to get some good shots - and won´t be bothered. So bring a tele-lense camera instead of a smartphone. There is absolutely no need to do ""Wombat-Selfies"" or running after their Joeys!  But i guess, MI has sadly become an too important business to really enforce some stricter regulations. I just hope they won´t open hotels and restaurants on this island one day in the future and that it will keep its natural charme, despite the huge number of people going there. So: Go there! You better should! But if you do, please always show the respect that this island and its furry locals deserve and you will be happy when leaving, looking forward to visiting again."
Amazing history and abundant wombats.,"Great commentary on the ferry ride over.Rainy day but rugged up and took umbrella as minimal shelter when walking around.Wombats roam freely as do cape barren geese etc.   Everyone now asked to stay 2 metres distance from all wildlife as preservation measure. History of settlement was fascinating.  We walked to the painted cliffs - amazing but best viewed after 12.30pm and prior to 4pm when tide is out.  We found leaving on 9am ferry and returning on 2pm ferry enough time to look around settlement, walk to cliffs and take time to stop and eat lunch.  Take food and drink as nowhere to purchase on island.Would definitely recommend."
Magical Maria,"This island is truly magical ! You have to get there by ferry as cars are not allowed. Only Wildlife Tasmania have vehicles on the island. You can walk or cycle around the island itself and marvel in the wildlife (wombats, geese), the rocks and the beach. Try and visit on a clear, warm day and enjoy the tranquility and fresh air. Wombats come out in the afternoon, the local chooks and geese are out all day. You can stay at the backpackers which used to be accomodation places for convicts back in the old day."
Impressive sightseeing. ,"Amazing colorful rocks. Nice one day visit.All done by bicycle. No one place to eat. However, ruins are not interested at all.Worth to visit coast, beaches and views"
"Brilliant tour, cannot recommend more highly","This day was so much fun. Started with a great coffee in Triabunna then on our journey with two great crew who looked after us all day. We saw seals close up, sea eagles, we went inside sea caves and ate delicious food. We walked on Maria Island with the wombats and the kangaroos and were lucky enough to see amazing cliffs and go for a swim. This is by far the best thing you can do in Tassie. Can't recommend more. Have the best time! I know you will!"
Fabulous Views and Wildlife ,"We took the 9 a.m. ferry and returned on the 15:30 which gave us plenty of time to visit the old prisoner grounds and read the history of the place. Also walked to the painted and fossil cliffs. Go to the painted cliffs at low tide for best access to the spectacular cliffs. They are some of the most picturesque sandstone I've ever seen. Walking  around the island we saw plentiful wildlife including kangaroos, wallabies and lots of wombats that were foraging during the day. Coastal vistas are stunning at different points along the walk. There is a place to rent bicycles once you arrive on the island. The ferry ride isn't very long but if you are prone to seasickness take precautions. Maria island is definitely one of our Tasmania trip highlights."
Wonderful place,"Enjoyed the ferry ride, especially on way back when we had cheese, crackers and wine from the kiosk - real glasses and even had a little timber cheese board. On the jetty was a coffee van which made pretty good coffee. We took our own bikes so on the island we were able to see the Fossil and Painted Cliffs as well as Darlington. We accidentally went the ""wrong way"" to the Fossil Cliffs, heading there up a very steep hill from Darlington, instead of from the ferry jetty. The benefit of this though was a great view of the massive sea cliffs and the Bishop and Clerk. One thing I wished I could have spent more time in was the interpretive centre near the jetty. That was really good but I only had a quick look before getting on the return ferry. Saw a few wombats up close and personal including a baby one! One idea for national parks is to set up a kiosk on the island."
Wombats everywhere,"We got the 9AM ferry and returned at 15:30 which was plenty of time to cycle around the island. Wombats are everywhere, wallabies a bit more shy but also there in abundance. No food or drink at all on the island.Bike hire was chaotic with no obvious system in place, and a fairly painstaking cycling proficiency test before you are allowed your bike... but a really good day."
"History, Wildlife, Scenery and Adventure","As a participant in a Uni course, I spent 7 fantastic days camped on the Island. Although absorbed in the long day and night elements of the course, it was impossible to not to absorb the Island's scenery, wildlife and history. Day trippers, campers and school groups likewise were all observed to be engrossed in what the Island had to offer. Self guided cycling and easy to moderate walks look to be the most popular activities but, as there are no shops, you need to self cater. Bikes can be carried on the ferry or hired and respite from the elements can be had in the old convict dining room."
Maria Cycle Adventure,"Took 9am ferry, departed back to mainland on 2 pm. You need to book your bikes at least the day before either online or in person at the visitor centre together with ferry ticket. There were plenty of disappointed tourists who tried to get bikes on the day and none available ... very fun way to cover the island.Having said that the old guy organising the bike hire is a bit disorganised and a bit of a fascist (this was a penal colony after all). He didn’t have the bikes ready for the boat arrival (rookie error) and then insisted on a single file bike riding test for each hirer where he failed people multiple times for not changing gears regularly... I mean really, this is supposed to be a customer facing business not a drivers license test.Anyway when you get custody of the 2 wheeler it is great fun and awesome sights are scattered across the island (fossil and painted cliffs, a gorgeous wombat). Great day out."
Day trips,"Had a good look around the island, you can hire bike's they have different sizes available but probably a good idea to book ahead in the holiday season. No food available on the island so take whatever you think you need, take plenty of water but you can fill up there if needs be,Plenty of wildlife, good swimming, easy walking"
A wonderful experience,"Two families including 3 teen boys spent 3 nights in the Darlington Penitentiary accomodation and hired bicycles for 3 days. We all had a terrific time on varied walks, cycles expletive the varied landscapes and also the old buildings and history.  There is wildlife EVERYWHERE - truly remarkable. The accommodation was basic with no electricity or water. The mess hall has power, gas jobs, hot water and some pots & pans - bring everything else and $1 coins for hot water at the campsite showers. An esky is good as no fridge in mess hall. Great mobile reception all over the Island which kept the boys happy during downtime. The penitentiary accommodation can be noisy with young children and chatty old men 😬"
Wombat Heaven,"We came for the wildlife and weren't disappointed. Nice welcome from the Cape Barren geese Maria Island welcome committee, and some great encounters with the islands many very relaxed wombats. The painted cliffs were well worth the walk. We also enjoyed a swim and our packed lunch at Hopground Beach and a walk around the Darlington buildings. The lounge on the upper deck of the Maria Island ferry is a comfortable option for the trip over and back to Triabunna."
Plan to go,"You should absolutely go here if you are in Tasmania.  My only regret is that we only went for the day and didn't spend the night.  Yes, the facilities are pretty basic if you spend the night, but it would be worth it.  Although, if you spend the night rent bikes because you will want to see as much of the island as you can.  However, if you only have time for a day trip, go.  We drove up from Hobart for the day as part of a Tasmania vacation and, wow, what a great day.  I can't count the number of wombats, pademelons, wallabies, and kangaroos we saw and if you're a birder, you should bring your binoculars.  We even caught a glimpse of a very shy Tasmanian devil.  Walk out to both the Painted Cliffs and the Fossil Cliffs.  The times given for the different walks on the maps are very generous if you are a reasonably fit adult.  Be sure and take appropriate clothing, as in some rain gear and be prepared for some wind, and also carry sunscreen.  Also, pack plenty of water and whatever food you want.  The island has basically no facilities, although there is a place where you can refill your water bottle.Oh, buy your ticket for the ferry online ahead of time.  It will be less complicated."
Beautiful Painted Cliffs and amazing wildlife!,Painted Cliffs is a highlight of my Tasmania trip!  There are so beautiful!  I also saw several wombats!1. Do check the tide information when planning your trip to Maria Island if you wish to see the Painted Cliffs.  The cliffs are only exposed within two hours of the low tides.2. You can cycle to very near the cliffs where there is parking for the bicycles.3. It might be best to book the ferry tickets on-line in advance as it gets filled up during summer.
Beautiful place,"This is a wonderful place to visit and so beautiful. Lovely bea he's, great trails and lots of interesting history. It was great renting a bike so you can get further in a day trip. Recommended."
2-day visit at penitentiary with bikes,"An incredible island for a fortunate few. First book penitentiary well in advance.  No matter what anyone tells you or any travel or advisors, this is what you need to pack to make the most of this stunning place. Ginger tablets for ferry overTorchSmall eski. If you want cold beer.  Milk kept ok 2 days No fridges there all food goes in aluminium food binBottled water if you don’t want to boil for 3 minsCampfire toasterNibbles TorchSingle mattress sheet (vinyl mattress covers)Pillow and sleeping bagGrogWind jacketFire lighters/paperMatchesWalking shoesPersonal first aidBinoculars SunglassesPhone chargerHat1 large black Rubbish bag $1 coins for hot shower BUT careful it is  unreliable If you want to MTB then all available to hire there. If you you have an e-bike there are powerpoints in the mess hall that do fine.Charger. Signal everywhere.  Boat crew and park rangers are enormously helpful."
Amazing wildlife and great walks,"Exceeded our expectations - we saw Tassie Devils, a Potoroo, and innumerable cute little padmelons and wombats as well as the usual Roos  just around the campsite, and identified nearly 40 species of bird, several unique to Tassie. Plus a couple of moderately strenuous hikes with world class views. We camped, and all accommodation is basic, but we enjoyed the C19th Mess Hall where we cooked and sheltered from the winds - a great social space."
First time visitor,Finally made it to Maria Island.The weather was just perfect so much to see . Walking was not difficult wonderful views and came across plenty of wild life . A must if you are visiting Tasmania . Don’t forget to bring your camera water and your lunch . Enjoy
A magical place,"After a 30 minute boat trip from Triabunna we were met with abundant wild life, historic remains of early Settlement and stunning scenery. The Painted Cliffs walk took us about an hour and a half. Bicycles are available to hire to do longer tracks. Some basic accommodation is available. On a sunny day it was a fabulous place of interest and up close encounters with the wombats were amazing."
Best Day!!,"Wombats everywhere!! For a nature lover of wildlife especially, like me paradise. Saw Kangaroos moving from the bush down to the open ground mid afternoon. Walked in the ocean in the Bay round to painted rocks. Glorious!  Probably the highlight of my Tasmanian trip."
Grayline Tour,"Today was a remarkable day hosted by the professional Grayline Tours from Hobart. We chose to take this tour rather than drive. This made the island visit so special as we could concentrate on the incredible scenery, in depth commentary and discovering the UNESCO listed heritage convict township, wildlife, spectacular views and cliffs. I highly recommend this tour as a must when visiting Tasmania."
Abundant wildlife ,"One of our best days out on our trip to Tasmania. We walked about 8 miles total and saw beautiful cliffs and so many wombats, kangaroos and birds. Also a very interesting historical site.  We just took the 9 am ferry over and were ready to leave at 3:30."
So nice to being here,"Friends from Tassie show us this great place where a lot happend there.Nice to see the Wombat, kangaroos and Waliby .And the houses from 150 years ago build by the prisoners ."
A surreal experience - favorite place in Tassie,"Wasn't sure I was going to make the early ferry driving down from Bicheno, but made it in the nick of time and then proceeded to have an absolutely magical time on this island. The combination of untouched wilderness, roaming wildlife (SO many wombats), isolation, and the history of the remote penal colony made for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. HIGHLY RECOMMEND renting a bike, which you can do on the island for $33AUD. It's a fairly huge island, so being able to explore on bike was a blast. Went all the way to French's Farm and Encampment Cove, then over to the fossil cliffs and back in time for the last ferry out. My only regret is that I didn't stay the night! You should really prioritize visiting this incredible place if you're on the east coast in Tassie."
Gorgeous peaceful island with many happy wombats,"We loved this island so so so much. The ticket to Maria Island is not cheap at AUD45/pax but I assure you it is so worth it for a day of exploring a remote island with little sign of human life, but with Mother Nature in its gloriest. Expect clear waters and beautiful beaches, not forgetting the gorgeous patterned painted cliffs, and many resident wombats happily scurrying around the island! With any luck, you may also bump into other types of adorable marsupials on your trek.We did not have much time to stop for a break in between walking because in winter, our ferry timings were only at 1030am and 330pm. We did cover everything we needed to cover though from the Fossil cliffs to the Painted cliffs, and with quite a bit of time observing wombats up close in their natural habitat. Pro tip: 1) Bring your own food and drinks for a lunch/picnic on this island2) Watch out for the tide timings at Darlington Jetty and try to visit Painted Cliffs at its lowest tide, or just ask the Maria Island ferry staff for the tide timings and best time to go."
Beautiful and lots of cute marsupials,"A really lovely national park. We spent 2 days in Cradle Mt and were excited about seeing 2 wombats. Here, they were too many to count and all over the island roaming. The island is beautiful and unspoiled with few facilities but it’s definitely worth a visit if you want to see animals roaming around and beautiful scenery. I wished I had stayed the night because many marsupials are nocturnal and I am sure I would have seen devils and bandicoots or possums if I had. The painted cliffs and fossil cliffs are must sees too. We rented bikes but the path can be muddy and slippery on rainy days. And some sites aren’t that easy to ride up to."
Isoaltion,"What a place to visit and pull the plug off for technology. Wonderful. Womabts roaming around, nice greenery, painted cliffs, beaches, beautiful place"
Beautiful Scenery & Lovely Walks,"We loved our half day trip to Maria Island today, which we felt was plenty of time to initially explore and understand this beautiful place.We caught the 9am ferry over and the 2pm ferry back. During this time we did the Fossil Cliff Walk first (it took us about 1.5 hours round trip), stopped for a short break in Darlington, then did the Painted Cliff Walk (it took us about 1.5 hours round trip). We then sat down in the camp area to eat our pre-packed lunch before exploring Darlington and heading over the the ferry.We enjoyed the Fossil Cliff Walk most for the views but the Painted Cliff Walk was probably more beautiful and interesting throughout (changed from beach to forest pretty quickly).Overall well worth the trip over to see this beautiful part of Tasmania!"
Wonderful place full of wombats!,"We took the ferry here one morning. The ferry doesn't run everyday in winter so check before you go, because we didn't before we drove the first time...From the ferry we saw a sealion. On the island there were a lot of wombats, pademelons, kangaroes and geese. We took the walk to the fossil cliffs and it was beautiful although it rained a bit. We brought a picknick and stopped halfway to eat in the beautiful scenery. Next time we want to stay the night but we would need to bring sleeping bags for that.Lovely place!"
Day trip,We took our own bikes over on the 9 am ferry. You need all your own supplies. We saw wombats galore. We managed the top of the island fossil bay and the painted cliffs.  You would need to stay one or two nights to explore the whole island. Very peaceful place. Caught the 3.30 ferry home and were treated with a display from the dolphins.  A magical day fir us.
Great day out,"The tourist office in Triabunna where you buy the ferry tickets was very helpful and provided a map of the short walks that are easily done - we managed three quite comfortably in the six hours we had on the island. The commissariat store also has more detailed laminated walk descriptions which you can borrow for the day. No wombats for us on this occasion, but we did see plenty of birds and also Forester kangaroos. Simply a great day out."
Fantastic! Maria Island,"We booked the full day trip with Eastcoast cruises. The surpassed expectation. We have a beautiful sunny day, though a bit cold in the morning and our Mike and Meg couldn’t of been more helpful or friendly, wonderful customer service. We were taken to see the seals (sound like. Baby lambs😀) then we did a detour to play with some dolphins. The caves we were taken in were the best we have. Experienced. Mike is a truly skilled skip.The weather was very favourable for us to experience It all.Interesting rock formations and geology history lesson. Anchored up in a pristine sheltered bay and we served a lovely lunch.Went ashore at Darlington we we had ample time to explore the old convict buildings and walk history. We sawr at least10  wombats in there natural territory, that was my highlight. We both highly recommend East CoastCrusies to Maria Island, and we will be back again."
A Magical Place,"Despite the convict history Maria Island is a must see. No cars and stunning scenery. No ice creams or cafes make it even more tranquil. There are camping facilities and cycling, otherwise it’s walking on well maintained paths and tracks.Beaches look like the Caribbean though the water is icy, straight from the Antarctic.Wildlife abounds and seems very friendly, the wombats are amazing.Also the short ferry crossing is lovely on a fine day.Do go and see for yourself."
Maria Island Aboriginal Cultural Tour,"I really enjoyed this brief 1-hour session with my two excellent guides (Jamie and Mitchum? Sorry if I don’t remember names correctly)...they are well versed in a range of cultural topics but were able to tailor our tour to my interest in aboriginal uses of native plants for food and medicine. It was interesting and fun to stroll around the area and sample a variety of flora (it was good!) and hear how it was used and cultivated. I asked a lot of questions and got very good, informative and thoughtful answers. Food is just a piece of a culture but it was interesting how it revealed other aspects and customs of aboriginal life. The guides were genuinely enthusiastic and enjoyable and I liked the informal structure. Would love to encounter another tour like this regarding other topics of aboriginal culture.Thanks for the experience, it was a great addition to my day at Maria Island."
Enchanting convict history and wildlife ,"Paris and I arrived ON Maria Island in a Par Avion Cessna surrounded by white sandy beaches with clear turquoise waters and high limestone cliffs. The next hour my daughter and I skipped, walked and even danced over the grasslands and immersed ourselves into the peaceful natural beauty of this hidden gem called Maria Island. We discovered convict ruins, trails, open forests and up close to local wildlife Kangaroos & Cape Barren Geese. The serenity was mind blowing. There is also a ferry that brings people over to Maria Island so they too can wander around or even hire bikes and go for a ride on the dirt tracks exploring more of the beautiful island and convict history. There is also a camping ground and has great amenities.  A must see unique island that you need to explore when next in Tassie."
Must visit,An interesting place to explore with native Tasmanian wildlife. Lots of day walks. No facilities on the island but worth visiting for the wombats alone! No mechanised vehicles but you can cycle and there is a simple bunk house too.
Lots of easy walks to great views,"The island is a fun 30 minute boat ride from Triabunna, where we had no issue parking first thing in the morning.We walked 3 fairly easy short walks: to the Painted Cliffs (wow!), the reservoir (for lunch) and fossil cliffs. This required 5 or 6 hours before we headed back on the boat.There is a longer walk to Mount Maria, which we would do if we came again.We didn't see too much wildlife, but the views and scenery are amazing! We were glad we brought a pack-lunch as there is no cafe nor shop on the island."
A superb snapshot in time ,We caught the ferry across from Triabunna where we had stayed the night before. As soon as we caught sight of Maria Island we were captivated. From the original Aboriginal occupation it became a convict settlement in the 1800s during two different periods. One large area of cliffs were quarried for limestone and were found to contain thousands of fossils - it is still easy to find these today. Many buildings have been beautifully preserved and the views from around the island are nothing short of spectacular. We thought the place would be crowded given the number of tourists on the ferry but we spent most of our time alone. The bird life was prolific in addition to the kangaroos and wallabies we crossed paths with. Great exercise too - we took it easy and still clocked up well over 10 kms on foot.I would highly recommend this to anyone.
Worth a visit but bring sunscreen,Great place with plenty of natural beauty. Definitely worth a day (or more if camping). Lots of beautiful views although we liked the painted rocks the best. Make sure you look at the tide tones and get there as close to low tide as possible (this will be dictated by when the boat gets there though.) We just made it in time to get to the more impressive parts around the corner
What a special Treat,"Travel by boat to this magnificent little island where the wombats come down to greet you as you step off the boat.  national Parks Officers look after the island very well and there are hundreds of wombats to be seen grazing, don't annoy them.  If they come up to you give them a pat but don't chase them.  There are lots of wallabies and kangaroos.  Painted Rocks is a magnificent place to see at low tide and not too far from the boat.  We really loved this island and were so glad we got to visit it on a lovely day."
AMAZING CUTE WOMBATS,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY ITS BORING!!!!! Maria island is stunning!!!! So many wombats, cape barren geese, patty melons and wallabies!! Painted cliffs were beautiful  for those who say there not, it’s because you probably saw them at high tide!! So go at low tide! Fossil bluff was absolutely stunning, kids will love it and it will get them off their screens for awhile. Nice park rangers too. Toilets are a little dirty but ok."
Stunning vistas and local history,"I visited Maria Island National Park with a friend in 2018 to visit the Painted Cliffs. The water was so blue, the beach a stunning white and the Painted Cliffs. I definitely recommend a visit. There is overnight accommodation available if you want to see more of the island than a day trip."
3 days camping on Maria Island = overload of nature perks,"From start to finish Maria Island was great for our party of 6. Short ferry trip to go there where we had dolphins by dozens around the boat. Camping area was great and well maintained by the Rangers and the locals (aka Wombats, potter roo, pademelon). The very good weather did help a lot but Maria is stunning with amazing landscapes, crystal clear water, creeks, Bush and beach walks. You either choose to cycle or to walk. If you want to visit the island you need few days. A day trip will only give you a taste. Highlights are overloads of wildlife including wombats, kangaroos (big and small), ekidnas, the famous Tasmanian devil that showed up at night near the kitchen areas."
Walks on Maria Island,"The walks with Tim, who made us enjoy the walk even more so, because he loves what he's doing! included the convict as well as the preservation aspect of this trip, the day was thoroughly enjoyable and I would love to go back there its such a beautiful, serene place"
Isolated,Very isolated from the rest of the world.  Very basic facilities so make sure that you take absolutely everything that you might need.
Maria Island Bike Hire,"The whole island is paradise and the bike hire service tops it off. Absolutely exhilarating. I forogt how much fun bike riding can be, especially with wide open spaces and lovely views."
great afternoon walk,"Off the ferry we took the walk to fossil cliffs, then followed the track through to the painted cliffs saw loads of wandering wombats which was a real treat.  Finishing back in Darlington before catching the last ferry back, take plenty of water, snacks or even a picnic as there is nothing on the island, no coffee either!  worth the trip though."
"A former penal colony, but more for hiking and camping activities","A beautiful place to learn about history.  Book the ferry at the Triabunna info center.  The staff are very helpful with suggestions about when and where to go.  It's a short and scenic ferry trip.  Once there, you can take various self-guided walks around the island. You can make it as strenuous or as leisurely as you like.  It's easy to spot wildlife.  From the pier, I took off to the left and was soon strolling through groups of kangaroos who took little notice of me.  There are also pandemelons, at least one wombat, Cape Barren geese, native hens, white faced heron and black currawong.  I was able to cover most of the walks in the vicinity of Darlington.  Check the tides and be sure to visit the Painted Cliffs and the exhibits in Darlington.  It's a full day and well worth the trip."
Check the Tides Before You Go,"Most visitors to Maria Island do it as a day trip as like we did.The ferry crossing was a wee bit choppy as the winds were up. We ate our lunch of seafood basket bought from Fish In A Van which is adjacent to the wharf. There is no need to prebook the ferry tickets as the ferry can easily sit 100 pax and the 12pm ferry only had 6 pax in total.Upon landing, we were disappointed when the ranger guide told us the low tides are usually 8-10am and evening 8-10pm. Most afternoons the painted cliffs will experience high tide, rendering them inaccessible to all.With no choice, we left to walk the Fossil Cliffs. Be sure to turn right at ferry landing...the walk goes in a loop. Those who go left will hv a lot of uphill to conquer. Those who go right will hv a leisurely stroll.It is also advisable not to bike in Maria Island unless you are an expert cyclist. The trails are too uneven with many hidden potholes. Towardsthe cliffs, tge sheer drop renders them very damgerous for kids to attempt. Plus the typical howling winds. Very very ill advised to bring kids to bike here. We saw some and the parents were huffing and puffing up the hill carrying both their bike and their kids'bikes. So much for a holiday. Even amateur bikers were left with no choice but to walk their bikes up and down the hills near the cliffs. We were able to walk leisurely past them.We saw many animals, birds, wild chicken, ducks, kangaroos and wombats. Scenery was picturesque. There is a certain air of being lost in an uninhabited feeling around, plus ghosys of convicts hanging in the mist.Tips :1) Bring more water and snacks. Nothing us sold here.2) use the bathroom at the ferry point at Darlington. Wild bushes for rest of 3-5hrs.3) Bring windbreakers as the winds are strong and chilly.4) Turn right not left at ferry point. Unless you are doing strength training for Spartan race.5) Ensure u make it back to ferry with min 15 mins left to spare. We saw a cyclist frantically racing down the slopes as the ferry pulled away.6) Most impt, check the tides on the day before. Still a great trip!"
Maria Island Cruises,"We did the full day cruise on Maria Island Cruises. We circumnavigated the Island and stopped off for a lovely provided lunch. Then we spent a couple of hours exploring the island. Saw plenty of Aussie wildlife. The Wombats are so friendly. The Island itself has plenty to see and on the boat trip we saw many and varied landscapes. Sandstone Painted cliffs, caves and pristine beaches you see it all here. Seals and dolphins too. A great day out with happy and informative guides. Michael made a special effort to get back onboard after a bout of asthma which we appreciated. Thanks to the guys and girls at Maria Island Cruises. A friendly family owned and run business."
Amazing island with Wombats Galore,"Maria Island is a special place which has been used to creat a separate haven for Tasmania devils, free if the facial tumor disease, incase of extinction. The island used to have a settlement and this has been converted into bike hire, museums and some accommodation. Nothing can be purchased on the island so you need to bring everything with you (and take it off the island too)If you want to wombats up close (they’re still wild but you can get quite close), why wallabies, large kangaroos, geese, and have a keen eye to spot the different soieceis of birds - then this is the spot to visit. I wishe we had stayed overnight - when the devils come out (warning don’t leave your shoes out at night!) but what we saw was amazing. There are a number of walks (massive hills/mountains) and you can either do this by foot or hire / bring your bike. We hired bikes but I needed to walk it up a few hills because I’m a bit of a wimp. There were also so cross country trails.The painted cliffs are quite gorgeous - low tide is the time to go - and the fossil cliffs are very interesting. You catch a ferry across and then walk into town and you will see wombats and geese everywhere. So of you want wildlife then you will see plenty. I don’t think there are echidna and platypus on the island.Don’t feed the animals - they do bite and these may one day be taken back to the wild in Tassie and being reliant on humans increases their risk of becoming roadkill.Well worth a visit and try and stay the night."
What a hidden gem,"Have heard of Maria Island but nothing about what is over there including the fauna, the historical buildings (some from the convict times), the cliffs and the various walks.First was checking in at the Information centre where the 2 ladies were very friendly and helpful - brochures & tips.Then the 30 minuted boat trip over - the vessel is impressive and was a calm ride both ways, and the skipper gave an informative commentary. The boat had a small cafe serving hot & cold drinks incl alcohol. The boat goes regularly throughout the day,Once there, the suprises keep coming.  We walked to the Painted Cliffs (north west) which was an easy 30 minute walk and at lowish tide allowed for a walk along the beach and than around the low cliffs which were amazingly weathered in shape and showed a rainbow of colours. Was a fantastic photo opportunity.From there we walked back past the Oast House (semi-ruined) and onto the Fossil Cliffs (northern side of the island) - this walk was a bit longer & a bit more challenging. Once at the fossil cliffs you can walk down to the rock face and look at some of the fossils whilst also looking north over Bird Island & onto the Freycinet peninsula. The sheerness of the drop off the cliff was pretty spectacular.Then back to the 'town' to see the various old buildings which are brilliantly maintained - some are from the convict period, and some from the industrial occupations since. Have to say a great display.  Near the dock is also the old Commissariat store which houses a wonderful static display as well as some great videos on the release of Tassie Devils on the island. There is also a Rangers Office who can help with advice & maps.  Various other convict buildings or later around the island - the barn is in fantastic condition.The wildlife is also great - wombats a plenty (we even got to see a joey out having a feed with his mum) and so many roos & wallabies. The Cape Barren geese were also a treat - first time I had seen them.  I understand there are also Tassie devils but unfortunately didn't see them - not suprising as not there at night.There is also accommodation for hire, a camping ground and bikes for hire - the island is large & if you wish to explore the southern area a bike is a must. There is no food or drink for sale so you need to be self sufficient & bring your rubbish back home.We went on the 9am ferry & back on the 3.30 & that was just enough time for what we did. Do yourself a favour & get there."
Boat cruise,The boat left at 9 am went across and the skipper was able to put the boat right into a cave. Spectacular the colours the sun coming through a hole in the wall. On to the seals sleeping on the rocks round the corner to yet another cave for morning tea. Homemade lemon slice and fruit cake. Perfect setting. Across the water to play with the dolphins who put on a real show into more caves did water falls painted cliffs. Had lunch in a small cove could see the bottom of the ocean so clear. Beautiful fresh salad meat and cheese all Tasmanian products. On to Maria island for a 2 hour guided walk. Back on the boat for home. An amazing day thank you to the crew Meg and Steve.
Lovely day out,Took a day trip to Maria Island using encounter Maria ferry service. I had a friend visiting from Victoria who had never seen a wombat. We arrived in time for low tide and viewed the spectacular painted cliffs and then on our walk back to the harbour we spotted a beautiful mother and baby wombat. Very special! Walk also to Fossil cliffs which are very interesting too. Ferry back at 3:30. Great day out but be sure to take all your food and water as none on island.
Amazing day trip,"We had an amazing day on Maria Island. Took a packed lunch over on the ferry and hired bikes to ride around and see the various points of interest. There is something for everyone: wlidlife (wombats everywhere!), historical buildings and nature. A must do."
We just wanted to see A wombat,"All we were hoping for was to see a wombat (not roadkill), so we packed a lunch and booked the ferry to Maria Island. The ferry trip across was comfortable. The island is windswept and spartan (as written in the brochure) - we were prepared with packed lunch and coats. Wombats appeared to own the island! We hadn't walked to the township from the jetty before we encountered the little furry tanks contentedly crossing our path and mowing their way across the grass. The village is a lovely piece of history and the island seemed to absorb people so we didn't encounter many other groups at all. Mum was on crutches this trip so we didn't get to explore much of the island but we managed to occupy ourselves easily for the day. The beach is beautiful and clean and the waters truly crystal clear.We had a most enjoyable relaxing day."
Great Day Trip,"Maria Island National Park is a beautiful nature reserve for wildlife, historic ruins (UNESCO World Heritage Site), rugged cliffs, hiking, biking and beautiful scenery. We saw lots of wombats during the day and small Pademelon Wallabies amongst the forest. Some wombats will let you approach very close, whereas the wallabies were not as shy but still at a good distance. The park has introduced the Tasmanian Devils on the island as an “insurance population” of devils unaffected by the Devil Facial Tumor Disease. We of course were not there long enough to spot any devils.On our short day trip, we took the trail to the Painted Cliffs, to see the colors and the sculpted cliffs. They were stunning and beautiful. To see the full view of the painted cliffs, you need to time it for low tide.  To reach the island, you need to take a 30 mins ferry ride from Triabunna, Tasamania. The $50.00 AUD roundtrip fare includes park entry. The schedule varies for summer and winter, so check the Encounter Ferry website. We booked our tickets online in advance."
Wilderness paradise,"We enjoyed exploring Maria island so much we ended up doing it twice!!The whole island is a national park and therefore offers protection to its abundant wildlife and forest - including a newly established, disease free Tasmanian devil population!You get the ferry (run by encounter Maria island) over in the morning from Triabunna; there are several per day, and back in the evening. You can stay overnight although we didn’t.The best way to get around he island is on bike, which can be hired via the ferry company and picked up when you arrive.There is so much to see, but our highlights were the painted cliffs, the convict built reservoir with its surrounding forest (very peaceful) and of course the wombats (there are lots and often around the old convict settlement area, so you should see at least one).The top of the cliffs at cape boullanger is a good spot for your packed lunch too! There  isn’t anywhere to buy food on the island so bringing lunch is a must!"
Wombat Heaven,"We spend a long week-end on Maria, staying in the penitentiary.We took over our bikes and you need to remember to take over everything you need (its only $10  a bag. We tool our large back packs and a large eski.Had a wonderful time riding and walking around. I had one problem with my bike but the bike hire guy (Tony I think his name is ) lent me the tool to fix it.  Thank Tony. If you aren't a local then you you will need a bike in order to see as much of the island as you ca hire it from Tony!"
Maria Island is beautiful,Enjoy the ferry ride and complete as many of the iconic walks as you can. Fantastic place to visit. Plenty of wildlife to see and historic buildings to explore.
Absolutely wonderful!!!,"This wasn't on our list of places to visit but decided on it at the last minute. What a wonderful time we had!The ferry ride in was scenic and relaxing, then we enjoyed the walk with its interesting terrain and ruins. The stand out that had me squealing in delight were the wombats, I've never seen so many! And most were completely unconcerned when you got close to take a photo.We also enjoyed the painted cliffs and had a pause to drink in the view, make sure you go around the cliff for a view from the sea-side, there's a safe ledge, obviously littlies are best kept away. Our walk took 3 hours and we didn't have time to explore some more. Definitely take plenty of water and snacks, we'd eaten our picnic before coming across so we were ok. Worth a visit! I'd do this again cos there so much more than you can take in in 3 hours."
Maria Island,"Ferry was a good choice & discount for NP Pass & Pension.  Island is stunning with great views, walking trails & lots of wombats.  We are in our 60's & hired mountain bikes on the island & these were well maintained & great to tackle the many hills - we enjoyed the challenge & fun going down hill.  Take your own picnic lunch & water, hat & sunscreen.  No shops."
A must see in Tassie - recommend the cruise,"We were lucky to book a cruise with East Coast Cruises, brilliant views of the fossil caves & painted cliffs, there are no food options on the island so come prepared or take the cruise that includes lunch in a lovely sheltered bay. Easy walking, lots of ruins & wildlife."
"Absolutely beautiful, fantastic day trip","My husband and I did a day trip to Maria Island as part of our one year anniversary holiday to Tasmania. We loved it. We took the 10:30 ferry out and 3:30 ferry back, which was enough time for us to walk both the Fossil Cliffs and Painted Rocks circuits quite easily. On the ferry we saw a pod of common dolphins on both trips as well as some fur seals sunning themselves on the way out. One of the crew said they saw an orca in the distance recently. You can hire bikes which would get you around quicker (probably not needed for our two circuits), but there are some bigger hills where we saw people pushing their bikes. The walk to/from Painted Rocks was lovely, we saw pademelons, a couple of wombats, a wallaby and a devil. The views at Fossil Cliffs were spectacular, perfect spot for a picnic (but stay away from the edge!). More glimpses of dolphins frolicking in the calm waters, and an encounter of a wombat family including baby on the way back down. We almost stepped on a sleeping wombat at the entrance to one of the buildings, so keep an eye out. You can fill up water bottles at the Mess Hall in Darlington, but I think that's about it in terms of getting supplies on the island. The ferry has some limited snacks, so bring everything with you. Our trip was in late April and we were stripping off the layers quite early as it was nice and warm in the sun."
A great place to see animals,"We came here to see the Painted Cliffs. However, I had no idea how much wildlife was on Maria Island as well. I saw lots of wildlife.The first ones were birds pied oystercatchers and right after that ducks swimming on the ocean. I had never seen such a thing before!Then we saw a wombat wombat. He was so cute and he was ignoring us!In a tree we saw a passum. He was hidden, but we could see him partially.There were Cape Barron geese here. We saw them several times and they were friendly. However, for some reason, one of them came after me. We saw several Tasmanian native hen. They were beautiful!We noticed also the Hooded plovers, Wallabies and Green rosellas.However, our highlight was to see kangaroos hopping. There were several of them.This is the best place to see wildlife. Wow!This is a must see!P.S. Last time I covered all the attractions in Maria Island. it can be found at The Maria Island Walk the Maria Island Walk"
Cycling day trip to Maria Island,"We planned a day trip to Maria Island not really knowing what to expect. We hired bikes for the family (2 adults,3 kids) and it was great. We had a ball. The bikes were great and well maintained. Mark the cycle guide.was also great. Well done."
Must do visit,"Fantastic day out with plenty of wombats, Cape Baron Geese and Walabies.  We did the Painted Cliffs walk and the Fossil cliffs. Both are easy tracks and great scenery."
Don't hire the bikes if you are female,"We stayed in the Penitentiary for an amazingly cheap $47 for three nights. Lots to do, two mountains to climb, plenty of historical displays, and wildlife. However if you wish to ride and are a female, DO NOT Hire a bike on the island. The operator says he has mountain bikes and and they only come with men's seats - what rubbish. Very uncomfortable. Much better to take your own bike or hire from the ferry company."
Highlight of My Tasmania Trip!,"This is the place to go for those who love nature and wildlife. The Painted Cliffs is the reason why I visited this place and it did not disappoint. It is best to visit in low tide as you get to walk around to the front of the cliffs for a better view. The bonus was I also saw wombats roaming freely on its ground... However, there are some construction works (for accommodation I guess) currently in progress. How it affects the eco system here is yet to be seen."
One of our best days out in Tasmania,"We had booked the 9am ferry across (not too busy)and came back on the 3.30(busier). This gave us plenty of time to do the more accessible parts of the Island, but not any of the longer walks. We had a Parks Pass for our car & had to produce it to get a discount on our tickets (ferry only, no National Park fee).The trip only took around 40 minutes and is mostly pretty sheltered - a bit choppy on the way back but nothing too bad. As soon as we got off the ferry we could see wombats, but they didn't want much to do with tourists - one ran for it & one put its head in a small drain (we suspect the small child's logic of ""If I can't see you, you can't see me""). We visited the old Commissariat near the wharf where there was a display and a Ranger, then headed clockwise around the walk past the convict barn & fossil quarry. There was a resident wombat pretending to be not at home in the barn & numerous Cape Barren geese which allowed us to approach to within a few metres. The fossils were fascinating - mined for limestone content to make cement in the 1920's. We'd read that access depended on tides, but most of it is well above tidal influence - only if a big sea was running would it be inadvisable to lower than the man quarry area. Plenty of excellent seashell fossils in the quarry in any case.We got back to Darlington in about 90 minutes, having taken a few detours & stops for numerous photos. The circuit was around 4.5 km, with one uphill bit. We had an early lunch in the old Convict Mess Hall (serves the same purpose today for campers), which conveniently let us dodge the only rain shower of the day.We then walked to the painted cliffs. It was pretty close to high tide, so access was tricky, but we still managed to see some of it. We walked back past the old Oast House from the post-Convict era (1880's), through some interesting forest. We saw Tassie Devil scats on that bit of the walk.Back at Darlington, we took our time looking around the old buildings, mostly Convict era. The wombats were out and about and these ones didn't care about tourists. We had almost an hour to kill before our ferry back, so watched videos in the Commissariat.A wonderful place."
In the top 2 of the places we visiting during our 11 days in Tasmania!,"Make the effort to visit Maria Island!  It is amazing in SO many ways.  We spent over 2 months traveling in Australia and our time spent on Maria Island will long be remembered as MY VERY FAVORITE DAY.  We left on the 9 am ferry (convenient, well run and reasonable cost) and returned on the 5 pm.   We even had a bit of rain on the first half of the day, but it did NOT dampen our spirits.  In fact, we did NOT want to come back and envied those hardy young people that were backpacking and camping on the island.  Oh to be in our 20's again!  The island is a wonderful blend of the historical (buildings used for when it held convicts or various business ventures); natural (2 of our very favorite hikes ever -- painted cliffs and fossil cliffs) and educational (resettlement of the Tasmania Devil here -- make sure to watch the video at the visitor center while waiting for the ferry).   Wildlife spotting is beyond easy (Forestier Kangaroos everywhere, here and there a Wombat and of course the Barren Geese).  Make sure to pack a lunch and snacks.  This island has no store or eatery.  But you can fill up your water bottles at the campground area.  If you are of the age where camping is still great fun,  DO IT HERE.  I imagine that you might have the opportunity to see some amazing wildlife, in addition to the exceptional coastal views -- perhaps a Tassie Devil spotting?  Final note:  the ladies at the visitor center where you purchase your tickets and can get a Tasmanian National Park Pass, were super enthusiastic and set the tone for a great trip!"
Must Do Maria,"Haven’t been here since a primary school trip back in the day and great to see it well kept and maintained. Hired a bike for the day (glad we did), hadn’t rode a bike for years but had fun. Did most of the sights, painted cliffs, fossil cliffs, majority of the convict buildings. Bit disappointed in lack of wild life compared to trip years ago, no emus, saw a wombat,geese though. Next time up the mountains"
Amazing experience!,"Maria Island was the best day of my 5 holidays to Tasmania.  We did a one day cruise with eastcoastcruises.  Really did have morning tea with a colony of seals, cruised with dolphins, visited amazing caves, and then patted a wombat on Maria Island.  The perfect day!"
Must do cruise!,Highlight of our trip to Tasmania by far! Awesome staff amazing natural wonders. Would recommend to everyone as a must do if you're on the east coast.
Nature and History in abundance,"What a fantastic place.  We spent a glorious day on the island - visiting the old buildings and learning about the convict past, walking through woodland, and relaxing on the beach.  Some fascinating rock formations, loads of wombats, and birdlife. We all loved the place."
Best day of our holiday,"I wanted to go to Maria Island to see some wombats. It ended up being the best day of our holiday (and we visited a lot of places). You can see the wombats up close during the day, see kangaroos, cape barren geese,... and the nature is absolutely amazing and diverse: cliffs, open fields, forests, beautiful beaches. I loved Maria Island! Just go for yourself and you'll see! Oh and bring your own food and drinks!"
Beautiful - but be careful of the cycle path,"Beautiful island, nice ferry trip and amazing scenery. Be sure to hire a bike before you go, as there are limited options on the island. The ride along the coast is beautiful, but be careful if you take the inland path - it is ridiculously steep, rocky and muddy. If you're an experienced mountain biker it's probably very easy, but for anyone else it is thoroughly unenjoyable."
Amazing isolated island with convict history but lacking Aboriginal history,"Maria Island is a very interesting place to visit. Being so isolated, you need to bring your own water and food (especially important if you are camping). There are beautiful walks and a sense of quiet you don't get very often in life. However, while the convict history is very clear, with buildings and guide points, I couldn't find very much about Aboriginal populations. I would like to see a full island overlay of sacred sites and information about massacres and other displacement. If we are to overcome current racism, we need to acknowledge what happened in the past and what flows over to today."
a flock of wombats,"This is a beautiful place. Wombats are so plentiful in the late afternoon that they resemble flocks of grazing sheep.With the help of their cousins - the kangaroos, they keep the vegetation well shorn. In fact in parts the island looks overgrazed.Cape Barren geese stalk around Darlington with an impressive patch of greenish / yellow 'high-viz' skin just above their bills.We didn't see any Devils but their scats are plentiful.This is a place for people of all ages. Walks abound and vary in difficulty from the  easy walks around the historic township, to destinations such as the Painted Cliffs and Fossil Bay and the challenging climb to Bishop & Clerk with its fabulous views.Ferries run regularly from the mainland though we visited aboard the Lady Eugenie with the Tasmanian Walking Company.No shops - so take everything you will need, including your bicycle if you like riding. The trails are good and bikes are popular way around most sites. There are toilet facilities at the Darlington peer."
Fantastic ,"We caught the 10:30 ferry over and the 3:30 back. We found it to be plenty of time although we didn’t see everything there was to offer! Hire bikes, that way you can see a lot more in a shorter space of time. It really did feel like a step back in time. When we arrived, we were lucky enough to see a Tas Parks wildlife operator act out as if he was one of the “red coats” and tell us all about the island. We also saw a “convict” working on the mill. Just such a cool experience. The hills can be a bit tiring on the legs. I’d go over and camp next time when we go back!"
History and exercise ,Maria Island is unspoilt due mainly to their policy of no shops and what you take over you bring back including waste. It is a 30 min ride from Triabunna on a well-appointed fast ferry which can handle bikes and all your camping gear if staying for a few nights. There is abundant wildlife and if you stay you will see Devils around dusk. In addition to the historical sites there are numerous walking and cycle trails and a couple of decent mountain hikes (Maria and Bishop & Clerk). Beaches are safe for swimming and the park rangers do a great job keeping you informed. Bikes are available for hire.
Plan more time,"We went there on the first ferry at 9 am and returned at 5 pm. It wasn't enough since we rode bikes from Darlington all the way down to Encampment Cove, including lunch and water stops and beach time. The first half has better sea views while the rest is in forrest. If you plan to ride to the southern tip, stay at least one night on the island. We saw Cape Barren Gooses, wombats and wollabies. Interesting day out!"
Truly a hidden paradise! ,"Was there for a day trip. Nearing Maria Island, you’ll be greeted by pristine, glistening waters that make it look like a true paradise- hard to believe it was a place for convicts! Honestly torn between giving it a 4 and 5 stars mainly because I cycled rather than walked and it was truly a once in a lifetime experience (as said by the bike rental shop) as I had to bike up and down very steep slopes, maintaining a constant adrenaline rush throughout the ride. For not so good cyclist, don’t bother with the bikes. But the main thing about the place was how serene it is and the formation of the fossil rocks and painted cliffs- nature is truly amazing! I’ll recommend this place to anyone looking for a little adventure on the unbeaten path."
Coffee Palace. A museum .....not a coffee shop.,"What an interesting location; history, geography, scenery and beaches. The walking trails are well maintained, marked and supported with interpretative signs. If you only have a day make the most of it and see what you can, but you really need a couple of days to fully appreciate and explore this island. Camping grounds and bunk house available for overnight stays but no shops or commercial outlets other than bike hire on the island. Yes a great location for mountain bike riding."
Cycling to the Isthmus ,"We did a day trip with our mountain bikes to Maria Island. We started south & saw the painted cliffs. Once we passed there (and all the walkers) we were pretty much away from the crowds. We wanted to head down to the southern part of the island, being aware that the isthmus was a sandy track. Getting to the isthmus (after French’s Farm) was also on a sandy track which required walking at times...very hard work. We ended up getting to the narrow point where you can walk to both sides of the isthmus, then had lunch on the beach & decided to head back up north. We saw plenty of wildlife. Don’t forget to bring plenty of water & food!"
Just beautiful ,"Maria Island is a 25-minute ferry ride from Triabunna. The return fare was $50 an adult. In high season you may need to book passage but this can be done easily online.The island has been used by Europeans for various purposes including a prison, a cement plant and farm. Relics from all these activities can be found across the island.There are lots of different habitats from open grassland to gum forest,  limestone cliffs to coastal lagoons and a decent peak to scale in the middle.Wildlife is abundant. We saw kangaroos, pademelons, geese, and lots of wombats.In Darlington, the only settlement, there is accommodation (but you have to carry your luggage so it's best to pack light).There is also a cafe there and public toilets.We did the fossil cliffs circuit and the painted cliffs (at a leisurly pace with a picnic stop) during our four and a half hour stay. You can hire mountain bikes in Darlington and go further afield.In good weather, this is a delightful place to visit.The ferry has an espresso machine  and there was a coffee van next to the ferry wharf."
Perfect day tour ,Went on a day tour as weather was chilling and accommodation quite spartiate. You'd better hire some bikes as it still a long distance to cover walking from one point to another. We spotted millions of wallabies echidnas and of course wombats. Painted cliffs is truly beautiful. One of my highlight in Tasmania
A beautiful place to go cycling,I hired a bicycle from Bike It on Maria Island and cruised down the coast road to the isthmus. The bike hire people are really friendly and the bikes are perfect for the conditions. Highly recommend! Just go slowly to not to scare all the wonderful wildlife!
No wildlife on a warm sunny January day,"We went over to Maria Island for the day hoping mostly to see wildlife during some of the walks. It was a very warm sunny day that was lovely for hiking, but the wildlife was in hiding. We did not see a single sighting of any wildlife on the day we spent there other than the beautiful Cape Barron Geese.  So that was disappointing, but wildlife doesn't live there to please us! We were told by the ranger that cooler or overcast days, or early morning, early evening times are good times but those times don't coincide with the ferry times. Staying overnight would likely guarantee lots of wildlife viewing.  But we did enjoy doing a few of the walks around the coastal areas and to the painted rocks and the scenery was certainly peaceful, blissfully undeveloped, and very pretty."
No time to waste,"Had been looking forward to going to Maria Island for a while & were going to do the lunch cruise but that all stops 1st May, $50 for the ferry for a 30 mins ride we feel is pretty steep, 1st ferry leaves at 10:30 & then you have a max of 4 hours before you have to be back for the last ferry at 3:30. It all feels very rushed although still did 2 walks but doesn't give you much time left as they both take approx 1.5hrs return. Wildlife was good Wombats, Cape Baron Geese, Kangaroos & one Wallaby. Overall with the expectations we had we were disappointed,  mainly by the time limit."
Glorious!,"I was afraid, after reading some of the descriptions of Maria Island, that all the walks would be too difficult for me, but they weren't at all.  The views were glorious, the water incredibly blue, and the mobs of kangaroos delightful.  Wonderful day trip from Triabunna, Maria Island was the highlight of my trip to Australia."
Magical walk - bishop and clerk,My partner and I decided to walk the bishop and clerk trail which goes to the top of the island. It was full of surprises and we arrived at the top to be above cloud level on the day. When the clouds temporarily parted the view ( and sense of achievement) was amazing. It's a great walk and took us about 3.5hrs return. The trail is well marked and about 13kms return. Highly recommend it and the Island as a day trip.
Be Prepared To Walk,Caught the ferry from Triabunna at 10.30am and took about 40 mins to reach the island.After visiting the information centre we decided to do the 2 hour Fossil Cliffs circuit.It was a reasonably easy walk with only one hill to climb which two 69 year olds managed OK.After the walk we looked over the buildings at the little town of Darlington.If you're planning to buy any food or water on the island forget it as there are no shops on the island and you have to take everything with you.We then revisited the informative n centre and watched some videos about the release of Tassie Devils on the island before catching the 3.30pm ferry back.Thoroughly recommend a visit to Maria Island.
Just wish I'd had longer.,"This was my over-all highlight for a week in Tasmania. So many animals, beautiful beaches, great camping - next time we'll stay longer.Saw Wombats, Pademelons, Tassie Devils all in the camping ground itself."
One of Australia's hidden gems,"A group of 12 of us headed over for a week to disconnect from technology and reconnect with each other. And it was a success. Each couple had to cook one dinner but for the whole group which worked out well. We camped at a simple campsite which we had all to ourselves. We caught the ferry from Triabunna which has recently been updated I'm told. Takes around a half hour.  There is only one car on the island and that is the Ranger's.Some campgrounds are basic whereas others have shelter housing with hotplates and barbeques. For those of you who aren't into camping there are some Penitentiary style rooms to stay in. Go the the Parks & Wildlife Service website where all the fees are set out.We all did many walks and our kids were young. Between us we kept them happy and hydrated for a walk of a few hours. First one was to the painted cliffs - yeh! Brilliant. Gorgeous place to swim and snorkel. Then up to Bishop and Clerk - brilliants views and you can see the dolomite columns.Watch our for wildlife in particular the possums. They will come right into your campsite and rummage through garbage bags. Wombats can do the same. Did see some wallabies and the occasional echidna. Tasmanian devils that did not have the facial tumour disease were put on the island to see if they could assist in helping them survive from those on the mainland of Tasmania. Beware though, they can be aggressive and although they may look cute, they can easily bite your finger off.While on the island you can explore the convict settlement township of Darlington. Check out the historic remains of the area and explore buildings just outside the settlement such as the Engineers House, Hop Ground Kilns, Howells Cottage, Mrs Hunts Cottage, Millers House and the cemetery. There are longer walks to Mt. Maria and the isthumus. You should be an experienced walker for this.Mountain biking – ride down the coast to French’s farm and the isthmus with the help of the Maria Island cycling notesheet. Be sure to check out information on Phytophthora before you go.Scuba diving and snorkelling – explore the marine reserve, snorkel under the jetty and see the amazing multi-coloured jewel anemones. Check out the Maria Island Marine Reserve webpage and the Marine Reserve factsheet for more information.Cape Barren Geese Maria Island are on the island and are a delight.I could say so much more but explore for yourself. A truly special and unique place in Australia."
Wildlife paradise,"We stayed one night in the penitentiary, and really struggled to get good information before our visit.  So I hope this review helps others.We stayed in Orford, and bought our provisions in the supermarket there.  It had everything we needed.  It was a 15 ninute drive from there to the small town of Triabunna.Firstly, the boat trip.  The boat leaves from the quay at Triabunna - it's well signposted.  Once you reach the quay, however, it's not totally clear where you have to go, but the ferry pulls up right opposite the entrance to the tourist information centre.  Be aware that you can't leave your car for more than three hours on the seafront parking bays - you can unload there, but then have to park somewhere nearby for the duration.  If the car park is full, there's ample free street parking nearby.  There are toilets at the back of the tourist information centre, but appeared only to be open during office hours.  It takes a while for the (kind and jovial) captain to sort out tickets and luggage, so these proved useful!On the day we caught the boat, there was a little van parked by the quay, serving coffee, cake, crumpets and the like.  Useful if you've skipped breakfast.  The boat trip took about 40 minutes, and every seat was taken - so do book in advance.  You can take your bikes on the boat, and there were no obvious restrictions on luggage.  We weren't lucky enough to see dolphins.On the quayside on Maria Island are a number of carts (like mega shopping trolleys, except you pull rather than push).  So you can put all your luggage in the cart and pull it to the penitentiary or the campground.  You do need to be reasonably fit to pull the cart, as it is uphill.First stop is the big ranger station on the seafront - you can get maps of the island there, and, obviously, information about the accommodation you've been allocated.  It has big information boards, and an excellent and quite moving video about Maria Island and the Tasmanian Devils.We'd booked a penitentiary room, just for the two of us - there are six basic bunk beds in each room, with a blue plastic-covered mattress.  So yes, you need to take all your own bedding, including a pillow, sleeping bag and towels.  The toilets are across the grassy courtyard - clean enough, and there's a good-sized disabled one there too.  Showers are a lot further away, down by the campsite - you have to pay $1 for hot water, and you don't get very much for your money.The penitentiary room itself was dark and gloomy (info pinned on the wall told us to be grateful, as it once held 33 convicts!!!), with just the bunkbeds and a big table, but there was a huge sunny communal terrace outside, with benches, and during the day everyone lives out there, or head out exploring.  So the rooms really are just for sleeping in.A lot of families come to stay on Maria, because it's a really cheap option.  So there was a lot of child-related noise, though it really wasn't a problem and everyone was very kind and friendly.There are no shops on the island apart from a little ranger shop near the penitentiary, which, if I remember rightly, sold a few things like crisps, and also a few first aid items.All cooking and food preparation is carried out in the mess hall - a huge cavernous and very unwelcoming room.  But it does what it says on the tin.  Kettles are provided, and gas rings (no need for matches) - the advice is to boil all water for four minutes, but no-one was bothering and no-one getting sick.  This might depend on the time of year though, so do bring some bottled water with you.  There's also a coffee machine, with hot drinks costing $4 - cups provided.  Otherwise you need to bring everything, including cutlery and pots and pans.Other buildings around the penitentiary house a couple of museums - well worth a visit, very interesting indeed - and an art gallery.The rangers put on a series of talks and walks.  We went on the night walk, with a wonderful very-Scottish ranger, which we really enjoyed even though we didn't spot anything interesting.  Well, there's not much else to do of an evening on Maria!  He told us all about the role of Maria Island as an ""ark"" for the Tassie Devils.We had hired bikes for two days but in the end didn't use them.  The walks - to the painted cliffs and the fossil cliffs - are very easy and no more than 20 minutes.  If you cycle, you can miss so much.  Late in the afternoon, walking back through the woods from the Painted Cliffs, we spotted a young Tasmanian Devil, and a number of kangaroos.The advice is to visit the Painted Cliffs at low tide - they're difficult or impossible to reach otherwise.  The whole area is beautiful, with interesting rockpools too.  The nearby beach was gorgeous, but the water a little too cold for us.Later on an entire mob of kangaroos came to graze on the pastures behind the penitentiary.  We took some great photos - they didn't mind us wandering nearby.  One female had a joey climbing in and out of her pouch.  And a wombat trundled right past the penitentiary building.The next morning we rose at 6am and again spotted a Tasmanian Devil just past the Fossil Cliffs - this time it stayed long enough for us to photograph.  We also saw a wombat with its baby.  Absolutely wonderful!!!  If you like wildlife, this is the place.  And the scenery, of course (apart from the old factory chimneys) is stunning.So all in all, it's one star for the accommodation - but expected no more - and ten stars for everything else."
Beautiful scenery,"The day started out right with a dolphin sighting on the ferry trip to the Island. We did the walk to the fossil rocks & to the painted cliffs with a little time left to explore the buildings. I would recommend that you time your trip for a low tide so that the painted cliffs are easily accessible. We saw plenty of Cape Barron Geese, a wombat & kangaroos as well as the stunning scenery."
Absolutely stunning ,"Maria Island is a perfect example of what Tasmania is all about! It's so rugged and feels so historical. The views are amazing! When we stayed wombats came right up to us for a pat and the wildlife is just abundant! We saw Tassie Devils, Cape Barron geese and plenty of kangaroos and wallabies! Absolutely beautiful! 10/10 would recommend if you love the outdoors."
Just amazing,"We really loved this place and cant wait to return - two nights not enough!  From the glorious walk to Bishop and Clerk, the beautiful painted cliffs and the cosyness of our room at the Penitentiary with a cosy fire glowing.  The wildlife is everywhere - we even saw a wild  tassie devil!!  We plan to come back for a week to have a really good look around :)"
If your going to Maria island go on the Maria cruise and walk trip. Operated by Mike. Fantastic cruise,"This is the best cruise you can go on, Mike and Jess look after you from beginning to end. Mike picked us up in Hobart and drove us to Triabunna, we got on the boat and had an amazing trip all around the island by boat, seeing great views. We saw albatross, seals, dolphins, herons, rays  and many sea birds. We stopped for lunch in a beautiful clear water bay, the food was amazing! Salmon, chicken, ham, pates, cheeses,crackers, wraps and rolls and salads. To drink red, white wine, water, juices tea and coffee. Absolutely amazing. We then went on to Darlington for a walk around, An great time to stretch your legs and look around. Wildlife was good, geese, dragon flies, wombats and wallaby. Return to Triabunna and safe return to Hobart. Mike wa full of great information, history and up to date info. The weather was great, the other passengers friendly and a fantastic day from beginning to end. Nothing was to much trouble for Mike or Jess, they were great. If you do any trip in Tasmania do this one. 😃"
For lovers of geology,"We visited Maria Island in February 2017 and it was a beautiful day - around 17 deg celc and a sunny day. Catching the 11am ferry and arriving at approx. 11:40am, we collected our park map from the information centre there and first went to the Fossil Cliffs circuit. For the first part, the walk took us across open, dry land along a rocky but well marked path. The last part of the walk was long and steep. If you're feeling extra adventurous, there is a point to the right which is a LOT steeper but the views of the Fossil Cliffs are higher and well worth the hike. Continuing on the circuit you will come to the base of the cliffs, where you explore the natural rock and find out why it's called the Fossil Cliffs. We went back to the main area (near the ferry) and had something to eat (be sure to bring a backpack as there are no bins on the island).We then went to the Painted Cliffs circuit. This circuit is a lot shorter, however there are a lot of rocks on the path so beware of tripping or rolling your ankles. Be sure to wear sturdy, closed in shoes. The Painted Cliffs were AMAZING and if you're fit enough to do so, you can climb your way around the rocky cliffs and explore the full length of it. The Painted Cliffs should only be climbed if you're physically able to. The water was crystal clear and it was a beautiful stop to enjoy some fruit. Definitely recommend a day trip to Maria Island if you have the time !"
Beaut spot to spend a few days,"A few friends and myself headed over to Maria for a few nights earlier this summer. If you enjoy being out and about with nature or visiting sites that were used an age ago, Maria island is a good pick for you! The ferry over from Triabunna takes about 30mins each way. They have campgrounds with a shelter housing bbqs/hotplates or if camping isn't your thing you can stay at the old penitentiary there.I'm not up to scratch with the human history side of the place, I personally went over to check out the Painted Cliffs, Fossil Cliffs and to do the trek up to Bishop and Clerk - gives one an awesome view of the southern side of Freycinet/Schouten Island. There's plenty of wildlife - wallabies, wombats, echidnas and if you're lucky devils, roaming about and there's a marine reserve just off its coast that I hear offers up some beaut snorkelling/diving times."
Beautiful and active!,"Depending on what you want to do, Maria Island may be the place for you! We hired bikes from the park rangers (Tip: they only have a certain number, so make that your first stop if you're on during a busy time) for $25 AUD for the day. Since we took the 9:30am ferry to the island and needed to leave at 4pm we didn't have a whole lot of time. There is not very many ferry services that offer services. Tip: A couple of ferries run but they're really tourist boats which take on extra passengers if they don't fill up with tours (people paying more money than you!)  I think we paid around $35 roundtripMany people camp here overnight and if you're a camper (I'm not) I would suggest it as there is a lot to see. We biked first up to see the fossil cliff and then booked it because we wanted to make it to McRaies Isthmus and back before our boat departed. This is an ACTIVE mountain bike ride. I am not a mountain biker so maybe for mountain bikers it's not as rough. I would recommend people do this but ONLY if you're prepared for about 4 hours of biking up and down rocky/gravel paths. It is pretty well laid out but there are some bits where you'll need to push your bike. The views are amazing and we would not have been able to see them in any other way, it's a 25 kilometer hike return to the Isthmus. We stopped by the painted cliffs on the bikes and that was pretty close to Darlington Harbor (you could walk it instead and do a light 1 hour easy hike) to get there. The painted cliffs are much more beautiful upclose rather than a view from a boat. IF you're active I would recommend all that we did which puts you back at a secluded beach (you will need to walk the rest of the way to the Isthmus (around 1.5-2k) which I would recommend basically parking your bike, right past the bridge after Frenchman's cove and taking the RIGHT path to the beach. Walk another 2 K on the beachfront to the Isthmus. We did not end up having enough time or energy at the end to do this, but we enjoyed the secluded beach where we were. If we had more time I would definitely have done this."
Amazing,Visited this wonderful national park on 5 Dec 2016 & spent the day wandering around this beautiful island with differing vegetation lots of animals & birds. Plan your day to visit Painted cliffs at low tide to get the most from it.. Also I think you need to love walking although if not climbing Bishop & Clerk or Mt Maria it is fairly easy. We did not hire bikes & most riders we met wished they hadn't. The facilities are very clean.I will certainly go back when next in Tassie. Take note you must take your own food & most importantly water.. it is a national park so no shops..
A day of beautiful nature and interesting history,"If not staying overnight, the Maria Island Ferry insists that you take the first boat back if you take the first boat over in the morning (which is understandable when they are fully booked). Therefore you will have four and a half hours on the island. This was just the right amount of time for us to:- thoroughly explore the stunning Painted Cliffs (round trip walk), the cool Fossil Cliffs (also the round trip walk) and the fascinating buildings / ruins (at Darlington and inland from the Painted Cliffs)- have a relaxed picnic lunch- and watch the wildlife (birds, native hens, lots of prehistoric-looking Cape Barren geese, and a very friendly wombat which emerged from its burrow after 4pm).Definitely a place we'd love to come back to and stay overnight. There was evidence everywhere of many, many wombats!Don't forget your hat and sunscreen - there is no shade for most sections of the above walks."
Convict experience,"For an authentic experience of convict quarters, Maria Island is a wonderful place to visit. A good tip is to take your own bike as the island has numerous tracks to explore. Cooking is done in a communal hall with basic but adequate facilities. There are also communal bathrooms and you need to provide your own lighting as there is no electricity. The wild life, wombats and Cape Barren Geese are everywhere."
"Excellent walks, amazing wildlife","Definitely worth a visit if you're in Tasmania. The island is in great shape. There's an interesting amount of history on the island. But the walks, scenery, and wildlife is second to none.Just be conscious of time. Some of the walks are quite a challenge. But try to do Bishop and Clarke if you have the fitness. Exceptional views."
A great day over on the ferry,My partner and I got the 11 am ferry over to the island. Packed our lunches and swimmers and had a great day exploring the island. The private secluded beaches were absolutely beautiful if was just a shame the water was FREEZING!!! We got the 4:30 ferry back to tribunna which was plenty of time for us.
Beautiful ,"We went to the island for a short trip 12:00 to 4:00. We only managed to go to the painted cliffs and the fossil cliffs on that time. The hikes are easy-medium with some uphills, you dont need to be in shape but is advised to being able to walk uphills.The scenery is beautiful. We wish we had more time to visit other locations of the island. The water is pristine and super clear, too bad I was not wearing swimming clothes to take a dip.If possible book the ferry with more time or if you like stay for camping. Unfortunately we did not see any wombats and tassie devils but we saw many droppings all around."
Beautiful island,"We took the ferry at 11:00 and were supposed to go back at 16:30.We were worried about time and wanted to rent a bike but there were none available. Luckily, four hours is plenty of time to visit the painted cliffs and the fossils cliff.Both are beautiful!Take a swimming suit to get in the clear waters of the island!I'm not sure about spending more time on the island, though..."
Beautiful island!,Maria island was the most beautiful place I visited in Tasmania. We stayed at the campground in Darlington and hiked the bishop and Clerk peak. You will see plenty of wildlife.
Australia's Galapagos - wildlife everywhere if you explore,"Our third trip to the Island - which is one of our favourite destinations in the world. The naturalised animals outnumber the visitors by a huge margin. Staying overnight in a tent or the penitentiary adds so much to the experience. Particularly In the early evening and morning, the wombats, pademelons, wallabies, kangaroos, Cape Barren geese, rosellas and Native hens are all over the place. We have also seen Devils and penguins, but unfortunately not this time.We took our bikes at a tiny extra cost on the ferry and used them constantly. Mountain bikes are best, but we got by with a road bike as well. Riding them to the start of the many wonderful walks (Mt Maria, Bishop and Clerk, Painted cliffs and south Maria) saves time and we saw lots of wildlife as we cycled leisurely along the roads.The views from the northern cliffs or up on the mountains are wonderful on a sunny day. Our only regret is that we could only get one night in the penitentiary - but you can fit in so many things on Maria in two days."
Maria Island National Park,"Explore the Majestic island on the East Coast of Tasmania. Take a ferry form Triabuanna, which take 30 mins to the Island. Book an accomodation on the island with the Tasmania National parks services or take all your camping gears to stay there for a night. The island have spectacular views of the ocean. Explore the fossil cliffs and Painted cliffs which are amazing. If you are very fit go to Bishop and Creek or Mt Maria for Hiking. Explore the waters near by snorkelling."
An amazing day,One day isn't enough. Plan to stay on the island. It is spectacularly beautiful. The wildlife is very special. Great walking tracks. Something for everyone and every level of ability.
"Great walks, interesting history and amazing scenery.","The walk to the fossils and seeing so many fossils was interesting. Then to Darlington for some of the varied history, penal, farming, industrial and now National Park. Then for me the best attraction, the Painted cliffs, just awesome."
Old Fossils,"We had a magic day on Maria, following the Fossil Cliffs trail. To a couple of old fossils the 3 hour walk seemed about right for us and it was. We explored the old buildings, and read the stories of the convict days, found some old machinery from the cement factory days and, yes, wandered along the fossil cliffs looking at fossils. The scenery is great, the numerous species of animals and birds fascinating, and the signwriting helpful while not being overpowering. Plenty of information is available from the rangers and anywhere is a good place for a picnic lunch. Being a smallish island it is cooler so an extra inner layer and a windproof outer layer is a good idea. We loved it and would happily return next opportunity."
Stepping back in time,"What a beautiful, nearly untouched spot Maria Island is. We went over there on the ferry and came back the same day but managed to fit in the Bishop and Clerk trek (about 4 hours) and a quick stop to the Painted Cliffs. The flora and fauna at Maria Island is majestic, whether it be the views from Bishop and Clerk or just the natural greenery. Having no roads on the island and no town (Darlington only has historic houses and a ranger station) really means you get away from it all, including hordes of tourists.The island itself is much bigger than we had the chance to visit. Would love to go back and have three days to explore it properly!"
"An amazing, tranquil place to clear your head and be filled with the wonder of nature once again.","A beautiful thriving island, filled with all kinds of wildlife such as wombats, Tasmanian devils, Cape Barren geese, kangaroos and wallabies as well as 125 species of bird life, as well as all kinds of flora and fauna. The beach is beautiful and the Painted Cliffs are a must see, where hundreds of shells of every colour and pattern, and rather large crabs, can be found scattered amongst the rocks in the water. It is only accessible via a short ferry trip, and there are no shops or large buildings, only a toilet and barbeque etc. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of life, this is the perfect place to go. Since is it a national park it is best to preserve what is there and not take any shells or other stuff home."
Be prepared to walk. Be prepared to be amazed.,"Took the Maria Island Ferry for a day trip to Maria Island. The whole island is a national park. The wildlife is everywhere. Kangaroos, Wombats. Wild Geese.The main attractions are the convict era buildings and the natural features. Fossil Cliffs. Painted Cliffs. Reservoir Circuit. The island requires a lot of walking and there are NO shops on site, so bring everything with you. You MUST book to travel over to the island."
What a magical experience!,"Four of us in our 50/60s set off on a choppy, windy, wet morning with some trepidation of what lay ahead in terms of weather conditions. What a stunning day! The only time it really rained we had just settled in the undercover BBQ area to share our lunch (near an open fireplace). We did both the Painted Cliff and the Fossil Cliff walks - although low tide was too early and we could not get around to the Painted Cliffs, the walk was still enjoyable! All up we saw 17 wombats, and about 10 kangaroos/wallabies, and lots of bird life including numerous huge Cape Barren geese. The scenery is stunning. The solitude is mesmerizing. The history is interesting. The story of the introduction of the Tasmanian Devils is fascinating.Take food, water,  and warm clothing and some waterproof gear with you and everything is possible!"
A gem,"We spent only a day here, so time was limited.  Hiked to Fossil Cliff and partway to Painted Cliff.  Close enough to see and photograph it. Lots of human as well as natural history here. A place to go slow, look closely, and take your time. Most of the animals allow close enough approach for fantastic pictures."
Heaven now in so many ways,"No doubt in past, Maria Island would not have been appreciated such as we can do today. The island's history makes for hard and sad tale. Today however, the isolation and exploring is a surreal experience where wild animals and raw nature are around every corner (not to mention the occasional windy shower atop of Bishop and Clerk) This was just one experience for us as ours was a day trip. There is so much more to do, so why not book some of the 'unusual' and oh so cheap accommodation.   You'll love the serenity of Maria Island."
4 wonderful days on Maria with Tasmanian Hikes.,"We had a great time exploring Maria with Stan from Tasmanian Hikes. Ably assisted by Senna and Natalie, who provided gourmet meals and fantastic company, Stan's expert knowledge made our hiking holiday relaxing and care free, as well as very enjoyable. My 11 year old son had expressed some doubts re the appeal of a walking holiday, but even he acknowledged he had a great time. We made many happy family memories on Maria Island and saw more wombats than we thought possible."
What a gem!,"We were expecting good things from our day on the island but the beauty and diversity of this place is just overwhelming. There are just so many layers to be savoured it is hard to know where to start. The ""adventure"" of the ferry ride across, the allure of the topography as you approach, you can't help but sense the special vibe of the island before you even set foot on it! The two major loop-walks are achievable in the day and offer an absolute smorgasbord of wonders to behold. It is the layers that stay in my mind. The geology, coastal grandeur, abundant wildlife, forest, grasslands, world heritage convict sites/buildings/ruins, absence of crowds/people/cars/residents; this place is ABSOLUTELY stunning!"
This is such a beautiful place....we rented some bikes and spent a day there,We were there at Christmas and we really wanted to explore Maria Island - we arranged the ferry and some bikes and had a fabulous day of exploring and picnicking. We would have loved to stay the night. Great scenery. Lots of great hikes and things to see. Take your time.
A wonderful secret,"What a beautiful and amazing place this is!  We walked for miles with abundant nature, history, natural phenomena and great scenery all around us.  This is to be thoroughly recommended for those who like to bike, walk or camp - there is something for all of those or simply for those who want an outdoors experience that should not be missed."
Wombat Island a Highlight of Tasmania,"Maria (pronounced Ma-RYE-uh) Island (nicknamed Wombat Island) was definitely a highlight of our trip to Tasmania. Wombats were roaming everywhere, and we also saw several kangaroos and wallabies and heard kookaburras. The tide was still high so we only saw a little of the painted cliffs, but we enjoyed walking through the forested area and looking at the old structures more. We were going to rent bikes but decided not to - we were able to take photos and enjoy the small section of the island at a more leisurely pace. Gorgeous views of the blue ocean and blue sky on a sunny day. Recommend for a nice day trip from Hobart."
"One Day, One Awesome Day, Not Enough!","Spent one day walking Maria Island. Especially Fossil Cliffs and Bishop & Clerk walk, and it was awesome! The weather was so nice, the view from the cliffs was really nice and the view at the top of the mountain was really awesome too! To recommend to all intermediate hikers (some rocks at the top of the mountain!). Plus the ferry (which is a must take to go there) was free!"
Nice day out,"Very pleasant place to visit. The boat ride over was nice as it was calm and sunny. The walks around the island are reasonably easy. The water is crystal clear. Short video to watch at the reception building that was interesting. Worth a look, cheers and safe travel to all"
Easily our best ever holiday in Tassie,"We've lived in Tassie for 5 years, and holidayed all over the state, but Maria Island was easily our best trip. We stayed in a penitetentiary room, took camping and cooking gear and loved the simple life. Relaxing on the front deck sharing stories with others at the end of a day of bushwalking, mountainbiking or exploring was perfect. Layers of history from ancient to indigenous to convict, colonial and modern only topped by the incredible natural environment. The summit of Bishop and Clerk is a brilliant place, as is the isthmus beach, and the coloured sand cliffs. I could rave on for ages. Make the effort to get here for a trip."
Wombats Practically Guaranteed,"Just off the small town of Triabunna, this island is an homage to preservation efforts for endangered Tasmanian species, as well as a time capsule of convict history. We only stayed the day, but you can overnight there, bringing in your own supplies, which would allow you to possibly come across a Tasmanian devil. A day trip includes wildlife experiences as well. We saw wombats, wallabies and birds of various stripes, not to mention the natural beauty of the painted cliffs and the fossil cliffs. There is so much to see and do that a few days are recommended. There is something for all ages and interests."
Beautiful and tranquil escape,"My husband and I recently spent 4 days on this beautiful island on the east coast of Tassie. We stayed in one of the Penetentiary rooms. It was very spacious, and the wood heater kept us so warm we slept in our sheets without our sleeping bags!The room had 6 bunk beds but as we had booked for 2, we had it to ourselves. If you like the outdoors, and the sort of holiday a national park gives you and appreciate history, this place is amazing. We did some interesting walks and explored ruins from when Darlington was first a penal settlement and then a buzzing business venture for Mr Diego  Bernacchi. After a hike, a hot shower and a warm drink, one can settle in the library cum museum and read about the lives of the pioneers there in the 1800s.The facilities provided by the National Park are good, even though I wished the hot showers were closer to the 'cells' than to the camp grounds.  The Park Rangers are friendly and very helpful. My husband left a nice wool jumper in the room and the ranger went to look for it. As she was coming off the island and drving thorough Hobart to get home she even offered to meet us to hand it to us. What a wonderful gesture! Much appreciated. We would love to go back and explore the southern section of this beautiful place."
"East Coast Cruises, Maria Island","Absolutely awesome day out, max people about 25, personalised service, expert commentary on the island by Michael who grew up in the area, and Kirsty who has a dual role of deckhand and tour guide, morning tea, lunch, tea, coffee, beer, wine INCLUDED in cost, also includes walk on island at old convict houses. A must see, will go back again. Awesome photography."
Well worth a visit,"We pre booked our ferry before leaving England and even in April it was full. We only had a day but it is a beautiful area for walking and seeing wildlife, as well as the Wallaby's we saw a Wombat and plenty of birds. Take warm clothing as it can be windy and take your own food and drink as there is nothing available on the island."
Lovely childhood,We used to spend every summer in the childhood here. The stay in the convict buildings may be roughing it but its great with a large indoor fire and picnicing every day.The island has lots of beautiful walks to go on. I've done Biship and Clark and Mt Maria. When we get off the ferries there are large trolleys to push your luggage up a hill. On the jetty there is a beautiful diving spot with lots of fish and stinrays.
Oast House - 200 years in one moment,"Encounter 200 years in one moment at Oast House, Maria Island! The track through the forest suddenly opens to a bright green grassy clearing. You can easily imagine how much work it took to transform the dense woodlands into these smooth fertile fields for growing hops. About 20 years later, the convicts also built Oast House, including the round shaped hop kilns for drying the hops. Immerse yourself in the tranquillity, enjoy the view of the ocean, listen to the birds singing and watch for wombats passing by.Continue walking or cycling over this stunning island - you may want to spend a couple of days to uncover its secrets and to unwind."
Beautiful place!,"We made a day trip here and very enthusiastically recommend it!  We did not make a ferry reservation in advance and were very lucky that someone did not show up and we got on at the last minute.  So I would recommend pre-booking the ferry!  We rented bikes on the island from the park service.  It is a beautiful place to bike but be aware that the roads are unsealed and with many rocks.  We very much enjoyed some hiking as well.  We saw fossils, kangaroos, wombats and several species of birds.  We had a most delightful picnic.  Also, the Rangers' Station sells delicious fudge!  Lovely place to spend a day...and consider an overnight."
Absolutely amazing,This is a must on your bucket list. It has so much to offer for kids and adults. The wildlife is incredible and the beach... Pristine. I want to come back.
Treasure trove,"My friend and I were on a short stay in Hobart from Sydney.  We didn't really have an itinerary but I was keen to visit my name's sake, Maria Island.  We made several phone calls on the day we had planned to visit but being Good Friday could not secure a trip on the ferry to the Island.  As luck would have it we decided to stop in at Triabunna on our way to Freycinet (thinking we couldn't possibly get on) but we did.  We only spent one day on the Island but it was magical.  There are so many wondrous sites and the landscape keeps changing  depending on which side of the Island you're on.  From the painted cliffs to the fossil cliffs there is so much to see.  History abounds on the island with refurbished buildings and other ruins of significance.  This is pristine wilderness and the wildlife on the island are a testament to this.  We saw countless wallabies, kangaroos, and wombats.  I suspect you would see even more at dusk.  My only criticism is that the walking tours could be mapped out more clearly.  As we only had limited we were nervous about which direction to set off in, what we were likely to see and what the return time would be.  If you are a nature lover and are keen to go back in time, this is the place for you.  A well kept secret amongst the locals.  I will definitely be planning another visit."
You can get there on a budget!,"To explore Maria Island on a budget - A ferry ride from Triabunna, where a ferry ride costing you $35 return for the day. The ferry has limited numbers of approx. 38 people and best book in advance. If you can walk, it is an excellent place to have great sceneries, history, wildlife. Make sure you bring your own food & drink supply, there is no shop there. Very basic but pristine and totally refreshing."
"If you enjoy nature,stay overnight for a different experience","Most of people are day trippers! But if you like off beaten trek and want to soak up what this island can offer, you need to stay at least one night! There is a roofed dormitory at the old jailed house. With a big indoors kitchen next to it. For us, we just camp on the other side of the field. There is a covered place with FREE GAS STOVES AND ELECTRONIC BBQ, And table and chairs if you don't get a picnic table at your tent site.or raining. There is also coin hot water shower! It was really magical to see wormbats and wallabies hopping around our tent eating grass! We even spotted the shadow of the Tasmania devil! Some people saw it during the dusk There are different trails for different levels of fitness! And a visit to painted cliffs is the MUST, and would enjoy fully when it is in low tide. (Another reason to stay overnight)There are metal tins behind the Rangers office for storing food and garbage to prevent animals invasion at night! The ferry ride is about 30 min and on our way out the skipper spot a pod of dolphins and he circled around and they just jumped and swimmed around our boat ! It was amazing! It is better to reserve the ferry spot! As sometimes it can be booked up!"
So beautiful - even in the rain!,Had a great day trip here even if the weather wasn't fantastic.Hired bikes and were able to cover a lot more of the island this way.This was my second trip and we are now planning another overnight stay.Great scenery and teeming with wildlife you be very unlucky not to see some of these unique wombats.There are a few hills on the island so we pushed the bikes a couple of time... But coming down the other side made it worth it.
Stunning!,"What an experience. So much convict history, walks both easy & challenging. If you like a good challenge the climb to the summit of the Biship & Clerk mountain a must do. The views are indescribable! Walking & climbing experience required for this one. Pristine water to swim in when the water temp is fine. Beautiful coastline. Great place for a day trip or accomodation is available in the penitentiary, as well as camping. You must take your own supplies. Ferry trip across approx 45 min."
A true gem,"We went on a trip around Maria Island and experienced not only the marvellous coastline but also dolphins, albatrosses, wombats and many other animals and birds. It is a highly recommnedable trip!"
Circumnavigation of Maria Island,"We took the 'Spirit of Maria' circumnavigation cruise, departing Triabunna 10 am. If you are into cliffs, rocks, geology, seals, dolphins, albatross, quiet secluded beaches, convict history etc this is a 'must do'. Very laid back but highly competent staff led by Mike. Included instant cokkee/tea any time, great cold lunch, and comprehensive commentary/discussion - very approachable guy. After the cruise we walked around the old town and saw most of the historic attractions. Must come back another day to do more walking and cycling (to Fossil Cliffs etc)."
Beautiful and unspoilt island,"There are a few photos loaded here but no written information so I thought it worth writing a short review, hopefully others follow. We visited for the day and hired bikes. Make sure you book your ferry trip in advance (it can get booked out) and reserve bikes (Maria Island Ferry, great crew!). Easy to get around walking or riding. Recommend only doing Painted Cliffs (really beautiful - see photos others have posted) and Fossill cliffs, if you are just there there for the day. Also interesting convict buildings around the old settlement. Road past 4-mile creek is bad so don't bother for a day trip. Bring your lunch as no shops on the island. Water is cool but so clear and clean - worth braving the cold for a swim. Overall a really great place and worth a detour."
"Overnight camping on Maria Island, Tasmania","We are not regular campers, but were able to get our bulky camping gear from the ferry to the campsite via a push trolley at the jetty. Staying overnight gave us more time to do the walks to Painted Cliffs and Fossil Cliffs and to have a good look about the convict built buildings dotted about. We found plenty to look at and loved the small honey coloured wombats that were everywhere late afternoon. Also the Cape Barren Geese. The campsite had free gas cookers and gas bbq's and hot showers (take $1 coins)There are no shops so you must take all you need, including water, although there is some available that you are supposed to boil. This is good for a day trip if you aren't big walkers but can manage short ones. If you want to do a challenging walk there are several to choose. Or great to just view the old buildings. Different to the Port Arthur site as less busy and less rebuilding. You can also sleep in one of the buildings on bunk beds with your own sleeping bags if you don't want to to take a tent. Good camp kitchen to use. We went mid February and the weather was warm, but it can vary - check weather forecasts. You have to book ferry trip in advance, you may not get on at this time if you don't. The trip over is only short, about half an hour and it was not a rough trip for us."
An unexpected treat,"Travelled across on the Ferry for a day and took our bikes. What a treat we were exposed to. Got great history details from the captain and great help from Phil with getting our bikes on and off. Scenery was great, lots of wildlife and we had a ball. Learnt lots of stuff we knew nothing about."
Amazing walk and wonderful guides,Just completed the Maria Island 4 day walk - 5 couples - and had a fantastic experience . 2 guides Shaun and Sam were incredibly hard working and most helpful As well as being knowledgeable and caring they were great chefs so the food was the best we have had on multiple walks in various locations including Mont Blanc Peru and NZ .
"Wombats, fossils, and painted cliffs = awesome day!","We only had a day on the island - took the first ferry over at 9 AM and then returned at 4:30 PM.  We would have loved to have more time.  It was crazy windy on the ocean but the ferry was stable and we didn't have any issues with sea sickness.Because we had 3 kids with us (two 10 year olds + a 6 year old) renting bikes wasn't going to work.  We started with a loop hike out to Fossil Cliffs which were really cool for the kids - you could literally see how the shells had been laid down in layers over time, and helped them truly ""get"" it.  The loop hike took us back to the ferry landing area, and we headed out on a loop hike to the Painted Cliffs.  We were able to arrive at the Painted Cliffs at low tide, so we did a bit of tide pooling before heading back.  The Painted Cliffs look cool in pictures and are even more beautiful up close and in person.We only had a little bit of time to look at the prison buildings - could have used more time on the island!!!We saw wombats everywhere on the island, which was really fun.  We also saw Kookaburras, kangaroos, and many other birds."
Sharon and Steve Cornell ,What an amazing day.  Definately a must do on your holiday.  Had a fantastic day out on the cruise. Highly recommend.
Wildlife and excellent walks,"This island off the east coast of Tasmania is reached by ferry.  It is possible to visit for a day or for a more extended period as a camper or as part of a walking tour.  Wildlife is abundant with many sightings of Cape Barren geese, wombats, Bennett's wallabies and the occasional echidna.  The island has a range of tracks ranging from strenuous and long hikes to easy walks. It is possible to walk along pristine beaches as well as inland along bush tracks  The island contains many historical sites."
"Well, it was nice.....","But not spectacular.We were just there for the day. Left Triabunna around 9 (?) and caught the 4:30 back, which I found a bit long. A 3:30 departure would have been great.We first hiked to the fossil cliffs, which were terrific. Then we went by the Oast House and passed by the remains of some old buildings. Finally we got to the Painted Cliffs (not sure of name) which were completely underwhelming. We have seen better elsewhere.And unfortunately we saw very few animals. A couple of wallabies, I think (small Roos?) That's it. Not even any interesting birds.I liked the no-vehicle nature. I would not have wanted to rent a bike. The trails were rough and there was a lot of uphill. I bike but I would have been pushing it a lot. So a pleasant experience but not a ""must-see""."
One day at the island is not enough!,"We took the first ferry (pre-booked) from Triabunna to Maria Island at 9 am.  We also pre-booked bicycles so to move around the island easier, which we understand is a rather big island to explore on foot.  Despite that, we only managed to visit up to the Painted Cliff and slightly beyond.  And that was because we took a 2-hour round island cruise (again, pre-booked) with the same ferry in between the island exploration.  The Painted Cliff was very impressive and beautiful.  The scenery around the Painted Cliff was very beautiful.  The sea was sparklingly clear and the sky crystal blue. The Fossil Bay is much further from the jetty and we wouldn't have had time to see it if not for the round island cruise.  The island is supposed to be full of wildlife but unfortunately we only managed to catch a few wallabies and a few wombats, in addition to the wild geese and ducks there.  We were able to get very close to the wombats and pat them, which was a wonderful experience.  We were not able to explore more as we had to catch the last ferry to return to the mainland.  There is camping ground on the island so it might be a good idea to spend more than a day on the island.  However, there is no amenity on the island at all and you have to come fully-equipped and well-stocked up with food if you are camping over."
A Must See destination !!,"To the National Parks and Wildlife team that look after the Island ""THANK YOU!!!"", for the wonderful job of maintaining this truly beautiful place and to the visitors who come each day, thank you for respecting this pristine Island so that others can enjoy the experience we had as well ! It is truly a BEAUTIFUL place. Great bush walks and cute native animals. Tips: book early and go early you really do need time there to experience the spectacular scenery, because if you wonder around too fast you will miss out. One down fall the ferry trip was uncomfortable, the ferry owners could invest in some new seats, no back support ! and perhaps a entry/exit ramp on and off the jetty's."
"wildlife - wombats, wallabies, possums, devils","Come to Maria Is. for easy walks, some views and lots of wildlife. When we visited lots of wombat mums and bubs - these are very cute. Not unusual to see 7 wombats at a time grazing near the main campsite and similar numbers of wallaby and paddymelon (small wallaby). Occasional Tasmanian Devil on dusk waling through the camp area. If you are camping you must suspend your food in a bag from a tree or better still, get a metal food container from the ranger station, otherwise the possums will destroy your food. Frenchs farm was more relaxing camping than the main camp as many fewer people and more open and natural. Fossil cliffs and Bishop adn Clerk walks worth doing. If  you dont want to walk far just go and see the fossil cliffs - millions of fossils. Rangers are helpful whewn questioned but seem a bit preoccupied and not as organised as other parks. For instance no weather forecasts posted at the Ranger station. Maria Is. is popular with locals because its so easy to get to, and international travellers because wildlife is so plentiful. In one afternoon and evening you will see more wombats, wallabies, possums and maybe a tasmanian devil. Main campsite has hot showers ( $1) and undercover cooking facilities you need to bring your own pots/utensils. The tracks suffered last week in the floods but are still easy walking. If you like push bike trail biking most tracks on Maria Is are wide and suitable for bikes."
Do it! Do it! do it!,"Everything about this island is so unique, starting with the trip on the ferry! The island is full of animals (my hint: go in early morning around 6 am, or late afternoon around 5 pm): wombats, wallabies and Tasmanian devils (saw one!) The place is just amazing, great for animal and nature lovers. We did 28 km walk return through French Farm to southern parts of the island (two bays). I will definitely do it once again, just let me visit Tasmania!The memory will stay in your mind for a long time and you will come back to it with such pleasure!"
Spectacular scenery,There are good bush walks and bikes available for hire. The ferry needs to be booked well in advance.
Bishop and Clerk - 3 hours return,"We did this walk - great photo opportunities near the sheer cliffs at the start, and from the top.Be aware that to reach the very highest point you need to actually pull yourself up a short section of vertical rock wall."
"Mt Maria - hike it, the views are spectacular'","We were the only ones to hike Mt Maria the day we went to the island which is such a shame because the views from the top are absolutely stunning! It is a 6hr hike, however if you bring mountain bikes with you it's more like 4hrs. This trip we hiked cradle mountain and wineglass bay and to be honest this hike was better than both. The vegetation changes rapidly, there are great views the whole way up and the rocks towards the summit were fairly easy to navigate if your use to that kind of thing. If you are on Maria Island go for it!"
"Lovely Island, walks, wildlife and beaches.","Enjoyed a day trip to Maria Island. Caught the ferry from Triabunna - $35 return trip - over at 11 am back at 4.30 pm. Although this was a short time, it was long enough to complete one walk to the painted cliffs, which was about two hours return to Darlington, the ferry landing area. There is no food for sale on the island, so a picnic must be brought with you. There are tame geese and wallabies to see, and a movie about a Tasmanian devil release program in the Visitor Centre."
A beautiful piece of Tasmania,"Mariah Island has a rich history with different landscapes ready to be explored.  The Rangers  do a wonderful job in looking after the park, its inhabitants and visitors.  My favourite spot is the Painted Cliffs which are best viewed at low tide."
"Wombats, fossils and beautiful views","The ferry ride takes about 45 mins and can be choppy, but if you're a boat person splurge on the $60 extra and go for the boat tour (refusing to call it a cruise) around parts of the island later on. You'll see rock formations, fossil cove, the painted rocks and if you're lucky some dolphins and seals. The island is well adapted to tourists but doesn't feel crowded. Listen to the tips of John the captain on where to find wombats, he knows his stuff. We hiked to fossil cove and felt like the only 2 people on the island for some time. You can go on various walking tours, none to challenging if you're moderately fit."
Wombat Heaven,"I hadn't seen wombats in the wild before, seen the Ozzie road signs warning of close encounters, but never had one. Maria Island is the place for that.We were walking some of the 60 short walks of Tasmania. On the day ferry we took in the reservoir walk first, branch off to the fossil cliffs then hiked back to take in the painted cliffs but decided that we wouldn't get all the way. It was on the start of the sweep of the bay that the first wombat appeared on the path in front of us and made it's way into it's hole. They have up to 15 day burrows that they use. A home for every purpose perhaps. On the way back on the open grass they were all over the place nibbling the grass and nosing about. If you stand still they just carry on their business at your feet. Saying that marsupials seem to deposit what comes out of the back end of them as fast as they eat it at the front. So one became experts on whether wombats had been around after this experience.So the wombats won the day on wildlife spotting. Fair amount of bird life. Good scenery. Fossil cliffs are sort of interesting. Book the boat in advance since it does get booked up in the summer. I booked it via Skype in the UK so as to ensure a place on the ferry. We drove down from Swansea."
Maria Island - A little jewel sparkling off the east coast of Tasmania,"Maria Island is close enough to to Hobart for a day trip or better still book in with Maria Island Walks and experience the full splendour and diversity of this historic island staying in their purpose built and very comfortable huts. Explore Darlington with its rich history of convicts and the ventures of the eccentric Italian entrepreneur Diago Bernacchi. If you sign up with Maria Island Walks you will get to stay in Bernacci's fully restored house in Darlington. The wild life, rugged scenery and secluded beaches will not disappoint."
Excellent day trip,"My partner and I caught the Maria Island Ferry for a day trip. I suggest you pre-book (we did) as our ferry was full to capacity. We were very fortunate with the weather and enjoyed a glorious day. Because of the winds and the tides, our skipper, John, recommended we do 2 walks in a clockwise direction starting with the Fossil Cliffs followed by the Painted Cliffs.I was thrilled by the number of wombats on the island. The scenery is fantastic. We also got to see the devil family living at Darlington. So cute!The display inside the buildings at Darlington was a surprise to me as I was only expecting to see outside. They have interviews with past residents and very interesting photo albums to view. Terrific! I think you need to be fit enough to walk at least 2 hours to enjoy this trip as I imagine it may have been a bit boring for some who just stayed at the township all day. I thoroughly enjoyed my day and highly recommend it to all!"
you gotta stay longer people,"I stayed for 6 nights, 4 at darlington camp ground in my tent and 2 at Encampment cove. Fully self sufficient backpacking.Money buys you very little here, the warm showers at the campground take $1 coins for 2 minutes, it can be done but you need to lather up first! Bikes can be hired from the Parks office, there is a very limited selection of emergency food at the Parks office.Maria Island is a very different National Park as its so diverse. Aboriginal settlement of which i found some old shell middens, French and Dutch discovery, English convict settlement in 1823, historic building and ruins. various farming exploits, the cement works, natural beauty.I climbed Mt Maria on the first day as the weather was good. Was a harder walk than i had expected. Last few 100 metres are up a steep scree boulder field so good balance and leg strength required. Views from top of the white beaches on the isthmus very Wineglass Bay like. Finished off going to the painted cliffs, best at low tide, beautiful sandstone colours and patterns of white, yellow and orange.Next day i went on the reservoir circuit and cut across to the fossil cliffs. amazing depth and amount of fossilised shells. Back via the coast and found a set of huge whale jaws bones and a massive vertebrae. Day three I took the more scenic but more difficult journey via the beaches and rocks down to Encampment Cove. Visited Bloodstone Point, amazing coloured rock patterns of white yellow orange and red, used by Aboriginals for pigments. Got a bit lost and had to do some bush bashing. Encampment Cove had a tank half full of water on the day shelter, mosquito larvae sometimes appeared in the tank water, I didnt bother to strain or treat them and drank them alive. There is a pit toilet where bringing your own toilet paper would be a good idea. This campsite allows small fires to be lit in the fire pits provided, this was helpful as I didnt bring a stove, and allowed me to make a hot feed. Their is no real beach at this campsite, its pretty rocky but is a nicer outlook than French's Farm. Lock your food away as the possums devoured my small bottle of olive oil, they will have shiny fur now!Day four I walked around the coast of Point Lesueur and to the old convict ruins. Hard to believe so many people fitted in the small building. I sighted wedgetail and sea eagles, forrestier kangaroos and heaps of wombats.Day 5 I walked to Frenchs farm and back to Darlington.Day 6 back on the ferry.When camping at Darlington camp ground you have access to all facilities that the people staying in the penitentiary have. There is a good day and night shelter where the gas cookers, barbeques, stainless steel prep areas, two open fire places (wood provided, chop it to size yourself) and tables are, no electricity or lighting, torch required. Warm washing up water which is a nice touch.In the mess hut some 150m walk, was a fridge and gas stoves, prep areas, tables and chairs, a table tennis table! and a coffee machine requiring payment. power points are here to recharge your devices.Parks rangers supply a limited amount of metal dust bins for storage of foodstuffs away from animals and if you can get one they make life stress free.I dreamt of doing some fishing but all the close by area is a sanctuary and the area to the north west are rocky, cliffy and kelp forresty. options looked a bit better down at Encampment cove and the Isthmus. A few small creeks seasonally tidal, may have held a few fish but I wouldnt be betting on it.Maria is famous for her big tiger snakes, but I can honestly say i didnt see a single snake for the whole week. it was too cold i think. A tasmanian devil called Nutella lives under the Penitentiary and comes cruising around campsites at dusk. she had two cubs who would come out to play on the lawn of the Penitentiary during the day which was pretty cute. Cape Barren geese, tasmanian hens, wombats, pademelons and very quiet and everywhere at Darlington.Most people just come over for a day trip or a one night stay, do yourself a favour and take a bit longer, I still didnt get to climb Bishop and Clerk or south of the isthmus in 6 days of snooping around. Biking is popular and would allow you to see things a bit quicker but would still require a few days.The critical thing with organising your trip is matching the ferry times and days of working with your accommodation  and plane flights.The east coast was in drought so the weather was cool-mild, windy but I had very little rain."
Day trip to remember!,"Photographer's dream destination. Stunning rock formations, white sand beaches, heaps of wildlife - kangaroos, wombats, devils, Cape Barren geese, plus historic buildings, some still to be renovated. Suggest hiring a bike or taking your own because sadly I didn't have enough time to also see Fossil Bay on foot. I recommend East Coast Cruises who sometimes offer a (ferry) taxi service and also do day trips around Maria Island."
OMG! The views and the wombats!,"Do yourself a huge favor and take a ferry to Maria Island the next holiday you get. The view is incredible and the island itself is so pristine. We went for the day and only had time to do the Fossil Cliff walk and the Painted Cliff walk. We walked around the historical buildings too, but it wasn't very much too see and definitely sub par compared to the natural surroundings. There are heaps of wombats too everywhere around the island. There was one particularly friendly wombat near the BBQ area that you might be able to pat and play around with, he (or she?) is the fat and furry one. The other wombats on the island aren't that friendly with people and will escape when we show up. Definitely think about renting the bikes, either from the ferry company or from the rangers on the island (we tried to rent from the rangers but apparently they are always on patrols away from the office), but even on foot, it was fine."
"Wombat, Wombats, and More Wombats!","The island is easily accessed by ferry from Triabunna and offers so much - historical ruins, sweeping bays and rugged cliffs and mountains great fro bushwalking, and the most remarkable wildlife. We were amazed at the wombats everywhere, though it must be remembered they are wild animals and not pets.  You are required to purchase a parks pass when visiting a national park in Tasmania and even though you have to take a ferry to get to Maria Island, it is well worth seeing this part of Australia's history."
Well worth a visit!,"We visited Maria Island as a day-trip in February 2015 and are looking forward to return, next time likely at least staying 2-3 nights in simple accom provided on the island. Beautiful walks, breathtaking scenery! One can also rent bicycles to get around. We went via the Maria Island Ferry from Triabunna. If only on a day-trip, then you wish to make sure that you leave with the first trip in the morning to return with the last trip in the afternoon to give you something of the day! Bookings recommended!"
Day Trip,"What a wonderful experience. I rang up early the previous week to book us on the ferry which would take us over to the Island...who were most helpful. We knew the weather may not be favourable however we made sure we were organised with wet weather gear etc. What a wonderful day, the rain stayed away and we managed to fit in two decent walk/trek's. I had no idea the Islands history so for me it was a step back in time. Life must of have been real tough! I have two words Do It!!"
Amazing,"This was the most amazing day. We caught the ferry which was free during the winter months. We just had to buy a national park pass. Once we arrived we were in paradise. The water was crystal clear and we went for a self guided walk. There were cute wombats everywhere in the wild, you could even pay them. We walked to the painted cliffs which were great. There are bathrooms to use. Bring your own lunch and drinks."
A beautiful island with rich history and abundant wildlife,"This was not our first visit to Maria Island, so we knew what to expect, and were really looking forward to it. Fortunately it was one of those wonderful winter days Tasmania can turn on, chilly and breezy but bright and sunny, so we had a great visit. We went on a day-trip, to introduce our grandchildren (8 and 4, born and raised in Edinburgh) to the island and hopefully give them a chance to see a lot of Tasmanian wildlife. Due to the fact that a lot of the wildlife are mainly nocturnal, we didn't see as many species as we have on trips where we have stayed a couple of nights. But what we DID see was wombats!  They are so common one seemed to see them at every turn in the track, and even grazing on the lawns of Darlington.Darlington is the settlement area that was formerly a convict prison, with the once largely-ruined buildings being progressively restored. There were two episodes of convict occupation of the site. Then in the late 19th century an Italian immigrant called Bernacchi leased the island and brought in a substantial workforce to set up viticulture, lime-burning and cement works, along with other agricultural enterprises. Sadly, his enterprise and imagination fell victim to a depression, and the island was once more abandoned, visited only by tourists and nostalgic former residents.Also abundant along our walk were native hens and the introduced Cape Barren geese. We only saw one Bennet's Wallaby this time, though they, Pademelons (or Rufous Wallabies) and Grey Forester kangaroos are abundant on the island. They just turn in for a siesta after an early breakfast, and generally don't re-emerge until dusk. Though we didn't see them this time, there are also emus that have been re-introduced to the island, and a rescue population of Tasmanian Devils that are doing really well, their numbers having now reached 150 and breeding very successfully. The other thing that particularly fascinated our 8-year old grandson was the Fossil Cliffs, with abundant shell fossils embedded in every rock wherever one looks, including under one's feet.There are every grade of walking track on the island, from easy to moderate to difficult. The walk around the north of the island, along the coast to the fossil cliffs then back around to Darlington, is fairly easy and presented our 4-year old grand-daughter with no problems at all. The round-trip walk to the Painted Cliffs (really spectacular) is also an easy one. To do both trips in one day between ferries one would need to be a fit walker who wasn't stopping every few yards, and not have small kids along. So we only did the first walk this trip. However it was most enjoyable and left us all pleasantly tired but far from exhausted. Advice to first-timers would be, if you have the time, do plan to stay a couple of nights, explore more widely and see more wildlife. It is possible to hire rooms in the barracks, or bring tents. It is also possible to bring mountain bikes on the ferry (for a fee), or hire them from Parks & Wildlife on the island. Everything is self-catering, so to stay over you need to bring normal camping supplies, sleeping bags, cookware and provisions.  If you don't have time to do that, as I described above a day-trip is still a most enjoyable interlude provided the weather is good. If it is stormy or rainy forget it — the day would be spent trudging about in the rain or cowering in one of the buildings in Darlington — pretty pointless. If coming on a day trip, bring water and food for lunch and snacks along the way — walking in the fresh air gives one a healthy appetite!"
Maria Island Visit,"So much history. We stayed in the Penitentiary which has 10 rooms all with wood heaters and bunk beds but no electricity. There is a huge mess room which has plenty of gas cookers and a large wood heater. Camping is available with an outside though undercover cooking area which has BBQ's. Hot showers are available for $2. Bikes are available for hire though BYO a better option. Lots of walks and historic buildings to visit. Lovely beaches. For just $12 a night, good value. Bookings essential. Take out your own rubbish."
Loved our day there!,"We took the early ferry to Maria Island (pronounced Mariah with a long i, not Mar-ee-a). We grabbed bikes at the ranger station having heard that the bikes from the ferry folks aren't as good. We took off down the road to the Painted Cliffs (check the tide to see when there is a low tide). The beach is just off the road and easy to get to. The cliffs are quite beautiful and it is a fast visit. We proceeded down the road on our bikes hoping to get to the bay for our picnic lunch. We saw a Kangaroo hopping by and a few wallabies and even saw a Taz devil running in the undergrowth and it crossed the road quite close to us. Amazing!! Maria is a sanctuary now and has a healthy and successful population of devils. I was so excited to see one in the wild. It was a lovely ride to the bay and it was virtually empty on the road. I am not in bike-riding shape so we went pretty slow and I barely made it. Come to find out that it is a slight uphill for most of the way. It sure was easier coming back. Then we went to the Fossil Cliffs and then explored the buildings near the ranger station. That is where I saw my first wombat. Cute little guys!!"
Awesome National Park,"This is one of Tasmanias best kept secrets. Great hiking and views from either Bishop and Clerk or Mount Maria. It has bunk house accommodation shared or bring your tent. Parks fees apply. Very leaves from Triabunna and arrives Darlington, bookings recommended."
Breathtaking,"This was our Third visit, we camped in Darlington and hired bikes from Maria Island ferries. As before we were enthralled by the range and variety of wildlife around and this time managed to see a Tasmanian devil. We would recommend visiting Maria Island to anyone interested in wildlife. The Rangers and also helpful and knowledgable. There is a cameraderie about the camping experience on the island too. We absolutely love it and will return as many times as we can."
The guide fetched the island to life,We visited as part of an all day cruise we took advantage of the guided tour which really bought this island to life as a convict colony. We would have missed so much if we had walked around on our own
Incredible !! Best place to see Wildlife in Australia,"I went to Maria Island with the main intention of seeing a Tasmanian Devil in the Wild and i was not dissapointed, i saw a female devil with 3 babies plus a huge variety of other animals. I caught the Maria Island Ferry over which was excellent and even saw Whales too.I stayed camping overnight and wish i booked longer, the place comes alive after 5pm , i stopped counting after i had seen over 150 Wombats,also saw 5 Echindas, 3 Endangered Wedge Tail Eagles, Seals, Snakes , Wallabies and much more. I have  travelled to African National Parks and lived in South America working in the Amazon and this is up there in my top 5 places for seeing Wildlife.The Island itself is incredible - beautiful beaches, interesting history and the sceney is just amazing. I will be back !!"
Grand!,"We can’t pick one highlight there were so many, the Island itself and the majestic views, the interaction with the wildlife, the campsites were fabulous, the food amazing and the guides so knowledgeable and friendly.  We went for a 3 day walk on the Island the group we shared it with were great, all different ages and levels of fitness."
Such a beautiful and peaceful place,"The best part about the island is that it's not particularly easy to get to or stay at.  This means there aren't many annoying tourists to get in the way.  We took the ferry over for a day trip and did three hikes, the Fossil Cliffs, Bishop and Clerk, and Painted Cliffs.  They were all great, though it was a bit rainy so there wasn't much of a view from the top.  The rocks are pretty tricky to manage, so this hike isn't for the timid.  We are pretty fit, and we had just enough time to fit the three in.  The Painted Cliffs are what we came for, and they did not disappoint.  It was so nice to explore the island at our own pace without a huge crowd, though I'm glad we just went for the day.  It seemed like the bunk areas could be a bit crowded and noisy, so it was good to head to our nice quiet cottage after our exhausting day."
Maria Island weekend,"Great weekend had by my Parents (in their 60s and active) and I.  Book one of the ferries well ahead to get there and back (1/2hr boat ride) and if you're going for the weekend take your own mountain bike and repair kit (sharp stones!!) their are bikes to hire on the Island from the parks and wildlife centre. We hired from the Maria Island Ferry - wouldn't do that again - poor quality frames/gears/no repair kit. Helmets are a must. Day trippers - well worth it for the day, the painted cliffs are strolling distance from the jetty, and the fossil cliffs a nice walk over gentle hills. Lots of gentle walks for day trippers from Darlington jetty and snorkling under the jetty as well.Weekenders - can ride down to the south end (undulating gravel road - bit of sand - then straight up the hill) or you can run as a training run. We climbed Bishop and Clerk (6hr circuit not fast) was a great climb with great views, bit rocky at the top with two big boulders that I needed a boost up. lots of wildlife to see, good camping ground with a few gas cookers and bbq, toilets and hot shower block ($1 gets you 2mins - solar so don't pay in the morning before the sun has warmed the water). Penitentiary accom - good simple room with bunks and mattress/fire/bench and trestle. book well ahead if you want this!"
The Maria Island Walk 4 days - Stunning scenery and wildlife and historic Bernacchi House,"A 4 day walk ( one of the Great Walks of Australia - for good reason) on Maria Island by The Maria Island Walk Co, highlights magnificent scenery, abundant wildlife, historic Darlington town  and scenic coatsline. Wonderful meals prepared by tour leaders, and wine, featuring Tasmanian produce. The last night is in Bernacchi House, a fully restored 18th century home with log fires and all the comforts of home. Tour leaders went out of their way to make this a very memorable journey, walking was easy-paced, there was nothing they couldn't do for you. Ensure you book with ""The Maria Island Walk ""."
Tranquility and Awe,An imperative MUST DO is to take an approximately 2 hours return (4.4 km one way) stroll to the Painted Cliffs at Hopground Beach from Darlington. The sculpted sandstone cliffs boil in prominent orange in the late afternoon; definitely a moment to snap and remember forever!Click for a more detailed article: http://travelwhenever.com/top-5-must-dos-in-hobart-tasmania-2/
An amazing day,"A place not to be missed.Our day trip to Maria Island was enhanced by the lovely sunny weather. The sea was a wonderful blue which provided a good contrast to the lovely white sand. On our walks we saw a Tasmanian Devil being chased by Cape Barren geese, wombats and a red robin, lovely to see them in their natural habitat. We also saw seals going over on the ferry.The Painted Cliffs should not be missed, we have put this experience up in our top 10. The colours and shading are amazing - took so many photos and am still looking at them. The walks on the island range from easy to challenging, each one provides a unique experience. We will certainly return again"
The best camping and hiking experience,"Well-preserved, beautiful island with fantastic nature! I saw cape barren geese, wombats and wallabies everywhere. Too bad I was there for 24-hour overnight stay, but the weather was perfectly bright. My friend Anabel and I walked to the painted cliff to watch sunset and woke up early the next morning to hike up to Mt. Bishop & Clerk! We passed the fossil cliff on our way there and finished the walk within 4 hours. Coming back to our camp at noon sweating like pigs, we jumped into the water, had a nice cold shower and enjoyed our easy lunch. It's a wonderful experience for a camping beginner like me!"
Maria Island 4 Day Walk,"The Maria Island Walk is a four day walk with packs and two guides basically from one end of the Island to the other with little deviations to points of interest along the way. The walking is easy with some optional harder bits, the scenery is mind blowingly spectacular......wildlife abounds everywhere and the  accommodation consists of cosy canvas cabins with sleeping bags on basic beds with mattresses....very comfortable. There is a main canvas cabin where meals are served and the heaters are turned on if necessary! The guides are fantastic and extremely knowledgeable about the flora, fauna and history of the island. They are also amazing cooks as they prepare all meals including your breakfast, gourmet lunch daily, a three course dinner, drinks and nibbles every evening using beautiful fresh Tasmanian produce, cheese and wines. An incredible once in a lifetime experience. It was also lovely to stay at Bernacchi House an historic house lived in by the Bernacchi family on the last night. An outstanding experience all around definitely five star"
The Best,"It is actually hard to know where to begin with this review AND where to end. (if it is too long - apologies)  My partner came up with the idea a while ago and we embarked upon the process of going on this walk.  ""Camping"" is not my idea of ""fun"" but I can assure readers that whilst the word camping can be loosely applied, the word fun was prevalent.  This is a MUST.  Being somewhat nervous by being a tad overweight, the walks presented a bit of a fear for me.  Unnecessary.  We went over on a mill pond of a sea and came back with a roaring southerly - talk about contrast.  At this point, it is necessary to mention that the two young ladies who were our guides - Louisa and Nicky - were the nicest, smartest and most professional of guides I have met and I am in the business (sort of).  The camping sites are well planned and very comfortable and enjoyable.  Being a bit of a foodie - the food, beer and wine was of high standard and of copious quantities.  Because everything is so well organised, there is nothing really that you need - as long as you take the necessities of your particular situation.  Wildlife at Camp 1 was not much apart from a small tiger snake that went north as fast as we went south.  We did 10kms on our first day and that mainly optional.  Day 2 was a lot harder as we went from Camp 1 to Camp 2.  The ""hard"" sand wasn't quite that hard and I had to request a short cut.  Louisa took sympathy on the old bugger and instead of walking the beaches, we walked the ""forest"".  Still another 10kms - but much easier.  On this day we saw so many wombats, wallabies, echidnas and other stuff that all was good.  Also - another big tiger snake - that again went away quickly.  Honestly, unless you literally step on a snake - they ain't going to bother you - send the guides first!  Camp 2 was a BBQ and the culinary skills of Louisa and Nicky are yum tum yum!  Best pinot noir served that night.  Day 3 was great but the wind had turned a bit nasty and it was cold - thermals being GREAT idea.  The painted cliffs, fossil cliffs and the township very worthwhile.  A great night with the group as songs were sung and bull was talked.  The last day was relaxing a quiet walk into the teeth of a force 7 gale and a light lunch before boarding the bucking bronco to return to the mainland.  This review is very simple - this is one of the best experiences I have had and I am happy to recommend it."
Maria Island Walks,"A four day walk that will never disappoint. The scenery is superb, the accommodation is rustic but comfortable, the walking is not too strenuous, and the guides take excellent care of their charges. The food and wine were very fine, enjoyed in the most sublime of environments. A particular highlight was the climb to the spectacular Bishop and Clerk, for some of the best views you will ever experience. The wildlife is abundant, and relaxed enough to provide great photo opportunities. The Maria Island Walks company gets a star rating from us."
Magnificent Scenery!! Serene and Quiet!!,"We hadn't booked for the ferry to the Island in advance, which was a big mistake!! Be sure to book well ahead!! However, our friendly hosts at the Island View Motel (Reviewed by me separately) managed to get two last remaining seats for us on the East Coast boat...Whew.....The ride to Maria Island takes 30 minutes and is pretty.The Island itself is beautiful. We (regretfully) only did the one day, but crammed in whatever you can in one day.We did the ""Figure 8"" walk - The airfield, Fossil Quarry, Fossil Cliffs and (Not to be missed!!) Painted Cliffs, which are absolutely stunning!One of the nicest things about Maria Island is the quiet. There are no vehicles on the island (Except for those of the Rangers) and it is never crowded, because of the small capacity of the two daily boatloads that get there.We saw an Echidna out in the open, and a mother Wombat with her little Joey nibbling away a couple of meters away, totally oblivious to us. We got some great photos of these ""cuddly"" animals.We were sorry we didn't have the time to explore further.......by bike or on foot....for more than just one day....maybe next time..??We also had great weather, which you can never take for granted in Tasmania......Maria Island was definitely one of the highlights of our Tasmania tour!!! Loved It!!!"
A MUST Do,"We have walked all over the world and Maria Island is as good as it gets. We did the 4 day walk with Maria Island Walks who make it so easy by providing everything except your own personal gear. The guides, meals, accommodation and experiences were fantastic. We even saw a Tasmanian Devil in the wild. Definitely a must do!"
Brilliant!!,"Such a beautiful place for a few days of relaxation. We had 2 nights, 3 days to explore this pretty place. Hiking, bike riding and swimming at remote beaches. Stayed in the penitentary. Only regret is that we took too much stuff!! We took too much water, thinking there was none available, but there was plenty of tank water for cooking needs. Probably best to check before you go. We also took cooking gear, but the mess hall has gas cooking facilities and hot water on tap for washing up. Without the excess gear it would have been easier to transport everything to the accommodation, although there are trolleys at the pier. Plenty of wildlife, sunsets, ruins and views to photograph. Will definitely return!"
Stark and beautiful,"This is so worth an extended visit. Visitors can do day trip or camp or stay in the Penitentiary. We camped and ended up hiring a bike for a day to explore further down the coastline. We saw so many wombats (my life's mission) that we almost became blasé about it- almost! Plus there were so many kinds of birds, Cap Barron geese everywhere, kangaroos, wallabies, bandicoots,...The weather was changeable: sunny and warm, then rainy, then blowing a gale. Overall it was cold though, in the middle of summer. I cannot imagine what it would be like in winter. If you're interested in covering ground I recommend travelling light and fully self-sufficient, which isn't what we did. We camped not far from the ferry stop and made day trips out in different directions, but we couldn't have made it to the southern tip as that was a 2 day trek and our stuff was too bulky to carry. The ferry ride out and back was hectic but it was unusually windy. Our captain made numerous jokes about sharks on the way out, and on the way back was absolutely loving slamming into the waves. He was good value, sharing lots of history and local knowledge, and thankfully, we felt confident in his abilities."
Maria Island Circumnavagation,We really enjoyed this trip. We were very well looked after by the experienced and considerate crew and were in a boat that felt safe & secure and didn't give us any concerns when travelling down the east coast of Maria island. Great lunch supplied.
Paradise,"Beautiful beaches, interesting convict settlement, incredible geology. Will go back to stay a few nights."
The Perfect Place to See real Australia,"As a group of 9 family and friends we traveled across to Maria Island by ferry with all our food, water and sleeping bags.  We were booked for only one night.The wide range of wildlife walking or hopping around us made the visit really memorable.The Ranger provided an educational presentation on the Tasmanian Devil which was extremely interesting.We were able to walk around and visit the original buildings and read the history of the island which was fascinating.The accommodation in the old prisoners quarters made a for a real fun experience especially with no electricity.A definite AAA+ experience for all."
Maria Island walk,"this has to be one of the best experiences. The three night, 4 day trek was absolutely amazing. The food was to die for, guides were knowledgeable, helpful, organised without ever feeling pressured and full of energy. Day a and Sean made the trip special. For my 15 year old to enjoy something ( apart from Xbox) it has to be good. The scenery is breathtaking and not strenuous unless you choose to do a mountain climb. We were delighted to see, in their natural habitat, wombats, echidnas, wallabies, kangaroos and a cute bandicoot unaware that he had an audience of 6. Did I mention the food - amazing, 3 course meals with local produce, fresh bread, delightful wine served with each email, candlelight dinners! Sooo much food I couldn't keep up. The last day saw the group celebrate with a champagne luncheon overlooking the crystal blue waters of the bay. This wasn't on our bucket list but is now. We will come again. Well done to all involved at Maria Island Walks and a big thank you to our guides, Dayna and Sean. You Took this trip to another level. If you are reading this because you are interested - do not hesitat, you will not be disappointed."
Maria Island Walk,"This was such a fabulous and memorable experience. The Maria Island Walk is one of the Eight Great Walks of Australia and justly so. The diversity of flora, fauna, geology and history provide a feast for the body and senses.Nine guests and two guides were transported to the island on the Maria Island Walk boat which is not very big but as it has to land on the beach it is a requirement (dolphins encountered en-route).Two nights accommodation is in two very comfortable campsites with top class catering by the guides. Full breakfasts, packed lunch, teas/coffees, wine and canapes and topped off by a sumptuous three course meal washed down with lashings of good wine - with candles!The third night is in a beautiful historic house in Port Arthur, with crisp sheets, showers, a roaring fire and a fabulous last night dinner.The walking is as easy or as hard as you like with various options depending on everyone's capability. There is also the ability to split the group should one lot want to do more than the other.Our guides, Louisa and Sean were fabulous. Multi-talented in cooking, local knowledge and generally lovely young people."
Maria Island National Park,Maria Island is full of history. We did a boat cruise around the island which showed the special formation of the island and the wild life. And we did a history walk around the place where the historic stories start before Port Auther.
lots of walking,"to truly enjoy this island park, be prepared to walk several miles. the classic figure 8 hikes to fossil cliffs and painted cliffs are worth it, especially the latter if you must choose. this double hike takes about 3 hours at a casual pace with picture taking. the reservoir walk took about 1 hour to take the circuit, and allow for a nice snack and water break at the mid-point on the reservoir. there are more hiking options which get you to historic buildings and more rugged terrain heading up the mountain. everything was interesting and yes, the promise to see wildlife was delivered on, especially toward the evening as the heat of the day diminished. keep the camera at the ready."
A walk for all,I did a walk with the Maria Island Walk. I really enjoyed the walk. The walk was for 4d/3n. There where additional walks if you chose to take them. I really enjoyed the wildlife on the island there was not a day that you didn't see a wombat. One of the Tasmanian Devils came into our campsite and stole one of the walkers shoes and bite a hole in  another walkers trousers leg while hanging out to dry. The walk was interesting as it was bush and beach walking. The food was the best I have eating on a walking tour ever. (Well done Jess & Dan). Though not a cheap tour worth every cent. If you can not make a tour a would recommend a day trip as you can walk or hire a bike to get around the old settlement
MUST DO FOR ALL AGES,"Just did the organised Maria Island WalkCompared to the Overland on Craddle Mountain we walked last year, this is a different experienceThis 4d/3n walk is far more relaxing ( you can add some more challenging climbs if you want) trip suitable for all ages if you have a reasonably level of fitness.All is perfectly organised,  owner dit meet us at the beginning and at the end of the walk.Maria Island offers great changing landscapes and wildlifeGuides Louise and Sean were great, offering all the help and info you needed.excellent food and wine, a lot better than on the Overland Track.Day 1 and 2 you sleep in bungalow tents and the last night in a beautiful restored house,  with hot showers and great sleeping.We would have liked  an extra day exporing the island, but is a must if you are in the region, even a visit of 1 day is perfect"
A must on any Tasmanian Trip,"So glad we spent the night on this wonderful Isalnd so we got in at 11 am on a Sunday and left at 4 pm on Monday. That was enlighten to get a lot in. Our first stop was the painted cliffs, the we biked down to Frenchs Farm, The most wildlife we saw in Tasmania. Walabies, wombats, birds, lots to watch. The bikes were not terrific but glad we had them. At the penitentiary we had a family of devils living under the porch. Great fun, Bishop &Clerk hike was not toa be missed. Great views, ( too much rock scree - but this is Tasmania ) and good exercise. Loved our time there!"
"Memorable National Park, Don't Miss It!","We wondered if we should take an entire day to spend here, only reachable by ferry. We sought advice from several locals, all of whom said you must go. So glad we took their advice. This was an island for prisoners circa 1820-1840, very well preserved. Lots to see and do. We walked the grounds nearest the ferry landing, seeing perhaps 5-10% of the island. It was incredibly beautiful and filled with wildlife, great sea views, coastal scenes, and primitive. No shops, bring your own food."
A lovely day's outing,"Maria Island is well worth the trip but choose a day when it is fine as there is plenty of walking to do. The boat trip across is painless for those who may fear from Mal de mer. We did the Fossil Cliffs walk first and, while it is steep in part, we retirees managed o.k. We then had the lunch we had bought with us, at Darlington in the picnic area. In the afternoon, we went in the other direction on the Painted Cliffs Walk -stunning. The guides tell you in which order to do the walks depending on the tide. There is such a variety of things to see -natural beauty, wild life & remnants of the island's early history. There are more strenuous walks; the opportunity to camp overnight or the Cruise & Walk Day Tour for a gentler approach. If you walk quietly you will see lots of birds. A mother Wombat & her baby crossed our path near Darlington. The return boat came too soon but it was a wonderful day."
A wonderful and relaxing day out close to many species of wildlife of this island,"The ferry leaves mid morning from Triabunna and takes about 3/4 hour to cross in this fast catamaran. There are camping and self catering accommodation available but we only went for the day. There are several different walks to do we went across to the other side and walked up towards a mountain peak we stopped to eat our sandwiches overlooking the cliff edge. It was a beautiful day. We had many encounters with Wombats, echidnas Tasman devils geese and small wallabies I have forgotten which species they were. The bird life was also very interesting. The historical penal settlement is well maintained by the resident park rangers. With good information boards in some of the rooms. Well worth a visit but take all the food and drink you require with you as there are no shops. There are a couple of public toilets. A great day out. Pick a day when the weather is good! Otherwise you might have a rough crossing. A good idea to book the ferry in advance as it can be very busy.Rain"
A Must See in Tasmania,"Our day trip on Maria Island encapsulated the Tasmania experience. An island of natural beauty offshore a much larger island of natural beauty.  We took the Maria Island Ferry, leaving at 10:30 and returning on the 4pm boat. Ann one of the owners told us where to pick up a bag lunch for the day (no food or services and no cars on the island.) John the boat captain gave us a great running commentary of the changes coming to Triabunna and made the ferry ride interesting.We headed north to the fossil cliffs, then around though Darlington and south to the Painted Cliffs.  We saw Wallabies and miles of deserted white beaches.Though only thing I would suggest doing differently is that travelers avoid renting bikes from the Maria Island Ferry folks. They are poorly maintained (our brakes dragged and the gears slipped). Ours weren't the only ones in that condition.  Much better bikes are available from the Ranger office on the island."
Bicycle hire,"Do not hire bicycles from the ferry operator. He two we got had not been serviced for ages. The derail lets were not correctly adjusted, the cassettes were worn to gear slip under load and the chains were dry and rusted. The parks service has bikes on the island which looked in better condition. The island itself is well worth a visit. We also encountered two humpback whales on the return freey trip."
Lifes An Adventure 3 day walking tour,"Best ever walking tour...climb Bishop and Clerk...see all sorts of wildlife ( including the Tassie Devil in the wild at night!) Learn the history of this incredible island ...geology , wildlife and the families of those who lived there. Fantastic support from guides Jef and Declan. Would not hesitate to recommend."
Great for day trips too :),"We only had one day to spend at Maria Island, so tried to get a guided walking trip. However, as this was low season, the single day guided tours were not available (only the 4 day trips were on-going), so we decided to head there on our own.Caught the morning ferry (10.30 am) from Triabunna. It was a pleasant 30 min ride, and we even spotted a whale along the way. Upon reaching the island, given that we were close to low tide, we headed out to the Painted Cliffs first (these are apparently best viewed within 1-2 hours of low tide). It was a very pleasant walk, which my 68 year old mom was able to complete comfortably. The Hopground beach along the way had beautiful soft sand and the water was a clear crystal blue/green/turquiose (depending on your angle of view). The painted cliffs were enjoyable to view up close and even sit along the ledges. The colours and layers were beautiful, and the abundance of marine life in the intertidal pools was very intriguing -- we saw mussels, barnacles of various sizes, mini anemones, sea grass, snails, chitons/molluscs etc just to name a few). We took the alternate loop back via Oast House -- this was not as nice a view and it is a longer walk. Based on the plaque, Oast House was built in the 1800s, and not much else was written about it. So it looked like a crumbling old brick house, though we did spend a bit of time wondering what the different remaining foundations of the house could represent.We took a very slow walk with plenty of stops to admire wild life (spotted a coulple of Tasmanian devils, and two wombats). In all, the Painted Cliffs loop took us 2h 45 min. We could have easily completed it under 2 hours, but we spent quite a long time at the cliffs.We then stopped for lunch at the main Darlington Township. Sat in the shade and ate some pies and sandwiches we had packed earlier. It was then one more loop to see the Fossil Cliffs. This loop had a fairly long uphill climb (going past the twelve apostles and passing the Reservoir circuit). My mom found this uphill climb quite challenging, and if anyone is bringing senior citizens along, do consider bringing hiling sticks. The view of the fossil cliffs was spectacular from the top of the hill, and we could see where hikers heading to the more ambitious Bishop and Clerk were going. However, we had to be back to the jetty by 3.55 pm (for the 4 pm return ferry), so we just walked along the Fossil cliffs, and came back via the airstrip. This loop took us 1 hr 20 mins (compared to the estimated 2 hours written in the guide).Overall, we found this to be a very enjoyable day trek, which even my mom enjoyed. We were blessed with good weather, and the treks are sufficient to fill a day, and yet not be too strenuous for a senior citizen. Do remember to bring enough food and water, and check the weather and tide times so you can plan your visit. And of course, plenty of sunblock and a good hat too :)"
You need to overnight there to appreciate it!,"Unfortunately, we didn't have the time, but it was worth the $35.00 per adult to get the 10.30 am ferry from the Triabunna Marina wharf to Maria Island, have a quick look around at the Commissariat Store (1834) and return to Triabunna at 11.15 am for the 30-minute or so ferry ride back to Triabunna. Normally a lot of marine life can be sighted: we saw one lazy seal, but whales and dolphin sightings are quite common at this (October) time of year. The ferry is fast and comfortable, has no facilities and offers no refreshments, but the skipper does provide you with a few clues on the sights offering on Maria Island and recommendations as to the best use of your time. Most visitors intend to camp there, and have to take all their own provisions, including water, but you can buy these at Triabunna if you need to. Whether you go, as we did, just for the immendiate return trip, or if you go for a couple of days, you'll enjoy being immersed in the colonial/convict history of Tasmania on this tiny penal settlement."
One of my favourite places on the planet,"Absolutely adored the day spent on the island - from the ferry over, to having the island virtually to ourselves, more wombats than I've ever seen in my life - it was all brilliant, and helped by perfect spring weather. Walking so that we did the Painted Cliffs last was a good decision - whilst we had beautiful sea / cliff views from the higher elevation (north), the sandstone cliffs on the SW part of the island are worth saving for last because they're just gorgeous and if you got there first, you'd never want to leave. Take a picnic, a blanket to stretch out on and you'll have one of the most fun days of your life."
A lovely place to visit,"It is easy to get things between the ferry and the camp site. If you have too much to carry there are caged carts to wheel everything down in.Darlington - There are showers (bring $1 coins for hot water) and toilets at the main camp. The camp site has a great shared space with gas BBQs and two open fire pits. Keep your food in your tend at night as there are many possums out on the hunt for a good meal. The camp site is close to the beach and about half way between Fossil Cliffs and Painted Cliffs. Walks - There are some great walks on the Island. You cannot go to Maria without visiting Fossil Cliffs and Painted Cliffs. At Fossil cliffs, make sure you head down to the water line. There are many more fossils down there. Painted cliffs are best seen within 2 hours of low tide. The longer walks from Darlington are either Bishop and Clerk or Mount Maria. Cycling - You can hire bikes on the island (so long as there is one available but they are limited) or from the ferry company if you organise it in advance ($20 per day). Alternatively you could take your own for $10 return. I find the Island much better by bike, If you want to camp for free and with less people you can ride down to French's Farm or Encampment Cove. It is a relatively easy ride (10km) on a dirt road. (great ride... very boring walk). Riding makes the isthmus very accessible (the best beach on the island) and walks such as the one to Haunted Bay. For some mountain biking take the centre road between French's Farm and the Mt Maria turn off.Lots of wombats. If it is quiet you might even see a Tassie Devil."
Prison in Paradise,What a great history this place share with the visitors!! Just heartbreaking - what happened in the world war time and how the aboriginals were shot down by the Britishers is a reflection of how competitive and selfish mankind is! The place is extremely beautiful which encouraged the Irish (during potato famine) to commit crimes during the world war so they could be sent here to have better food.FERRIES and ENTRY are FREE (I guess subsidised by government) if you travel in July end and August start.
Breathtaking,We spent a day on Maria Island and we can't wait to go back. Next time we will stay in the Penitentiary for sure.We did the walk up to Bishop and Clerk which is really pretty steep and if you aren't a regular climber quite hard - however the day was clear and the view across the island and over to mainland Tasmania was amazing. I'd love to do it again. We were lucky with the weather though. Kids 10 % 8 climbed the mountain too.
AMAZING experience of a lifetime,"I did a fair bit of research as I didn't know what to expect as I had an international visitor who loves nature.I booked a penitentiary room (only 10 available otherwise you can camp) through East Coast visitor information centre, it cost $42 for the night! We were travelling the east coast of tassie so we left our car at Triabunna. We took some warm clothes and food and a sleeping bag each.The ferry ride was quick and smooth, we arrived on the island, check in was very simple as there are no keys in any of the rooms, we were told which room was ours and made our way to the settlement. Room was very comfortable with three bunk beds and table and stools. There is also a fire place in each room.The mess hall has cooking facilities as well as electricity if you must recharge you technology but with all the beauty around not sure why people would want to be on their phones! You need to bring your own pans and utensils but the gas cookers are available as well as the BBQ at the camp site. Once settled we got ourselves a map set about tracking the island. The first walk we did was to the painted cliffs as we were told when the low tide was and wanted to get the best photos. It was about a 4km walk which was quite flat and easy. After spending quite some time there we walked back to settlement and did the loop to the fossil cliff. Spectacular. The fossils are so clear to see in the cliffs and you actually walk on them to. The patterns created in the cliffs over the thousands of years made for great photos.We made our way back down to settlement as the sun was starting to come down and the colour of the landscape changed as well as the many hundreds of kangaroos started to come out, it was a breathtaking moment.We got back to our room and there were wombats all over the place. The wild life on the island is thriving and it was good to see people respecting them being there. That night was such a clear night the sky was lit up with the most amount of stars I have ever seen in my life, the milky way was very clear and we could see shooting stars everywhere, I will never forget that night.The next day I spends walking around while my guest took a bike ride passed frenches farm and said it was a sight to behold.That was the most amazing experience we had on our trip in tasmania and both say it was our favourite place.Watch out for the tassie devils at night, they will keep you awake."
Maria Island - Hidden Gem,"3 of us visited Maria Island in June and stayed 2 nights and booked thru the East Coast visitors centre who were amazingly helpful. This is an awesome location. We were lucky enough to score one azure blue day along with some not so fantastic weather the next. Day 1 we did Bishop & Clerk. Day 2 hired bikes and cycled down to encampment cove and Frenches Farm. Bishop & Clark is a 'must see' and photos from the top of the peak are stunning. This walk is a bit tricky for those who aren't natural rock hoppers but my advice is to leave early and take it easy with frequent stops.  Parks staff  are very informative and the island is a haven for children as there're no cars on the island apart from rangers vehicles. Don't forget to get your candles from the Comissariat if you have a penitentiary room. One last tip is that I think shower timers start from when the money goes in not when you turn it on but someone else may be able to confirm...all in all a fantastic spot to get away to, can't wait to go back."
Wish we had more time,"We only had a day to 'do' Maria Island.  Next time we will stay and see more.  Our interest is birds and we saw plenty.  Also there were many wombats just grazing and not worrying about us trying to get too close for a photo.  There could have been more explanation about the convict days there, most of the information was about the walks.  The Darlington buildings were well cared for but, again, not enough information.  The National Park staff were very helpful.  We will be back."
Well restored convict settlement,"We visited by boat in mid May and while the Darlington settlement was closed, we were still free to roam around the settlement which has been meticulously restored and has enough signage to get a good understanding of the history of the Darlington settlement.We also took the loop track out to the Fossil Point platform which has an interesting display and history of the fossilised shells that make up the cliff-face above the platform. While the signs say the loop track will take around 2 hours, we did it in around an hour at a comfortable pace.Some of the contractors working on the wharf reconstruction told us the National Parks had recently stopped subsidising the ferry operators and there was not a regular service to Maria. If that is true it would be a real shame as most visitors wont have access to this national treasure.There are more extensive walking tracks and a camping ground, although you need to bring in all your supplies as there are no shops on the Island"
"Beautiful Island, great fun cycling around","We camped for two nights at Darlington and took our own bikes on the ferry. We had a lovely time! The island is very easy to cycle around. There is so much to see and explore. This amazing island has had so many different histories. The ferry crew and the national parks rangers are awesome people and happy to have a chat. Some tips;- take your own bike if you can. The hire bikes are pretty rusty and have had a hard life!- Rug up! The island can get pretty windy and cold.- There are hot showers (which are actually really good) at Darlington, but they cost $1. So ensure you take some coins.- Make sure your food is well stored (you can borrow steel bins from the rangers) as the wildlife are very bold, especially those pesky possums!"
Totally awesome,"For an island off an island off an island, this place was awesome.  We camped in this little paradise and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. I highly recommend it as a easy camping break with some easy walking, swimming and camping.  You do have to ship everything in though - there are no shops on the island"
Maria Island and Maria Island Ferry,Thank you Ann and John. For making our visit to Maria Island a wonderful experience with your friendly and informative trip on the Maria Island ferry .We highly recommend this trip                            Jan Hammersley and Max Cole
fantastic nature,"a wonderful sanctuary for wildlife with scenic views and a recovering nature, this island is well worth a visit"
Fabulous,The island is stunning if you enjoy walking and scenery and wildlife. As heaps of wombats and wallabies . Loved it
Maria Island cruise,"Just had an excellent day on the Maria Island ferry (not East Coast Cruises) Skipper John gave us an excellent commentary on the history dating back to 1642 and showed us some magnificent coastline, including an ancient river bed dating back to Gondwanaland. He then topped it off by putting us in the middle of a pod of about 50 dolphins. I can thoroughly recommend Maria Island Ferry. They provided an excellent cruise after the other lot really mucked us about."
Serene and well worth staying overnight.,"A ferry will take you to Maria Island where you will soon immerse yourself into a quiet Tasmanian paradise where cars are banned and hikers and cyclists reign. There are a good number of hiking trails through forests and plenty of opportunities to catch wildlife; wombats, wallabies, potoroos, birds gallore, etc. The Painted Cliffs are beautiful and alone are well worth the trip. I highly recommend camping for a few nights; there's much to see and discover."
Naturally magnificent,"We've been to Maria Island twice and without doubt will go again. It's one of the most beautiful parts of Australia and has a wealth of history to add to the experience. Stay overnight in Triabunna, which isn't exactly a tourist attraction but it's convenient, and start the next day with the 10am ferry to Maria Island. Spend as much time as you can on the island until the last ferry so you can at least see what's in the 'hub' - buildings, walks, natural features. Or do what lots of people are now doing and enjoy a camping holiday on the island, although we were quite happy spending a day to take some of the well thought-out walks the island offers. History lovers will appreciate the island's colourful past, as a penal colony, a vineyard and the site of a cement industry. One way or another they all failed, but the stories left behind are plentiful and fascinating. The island has an excellent website to help plan your visit, and it's worth doing some research before you go. Two things to be aware of: there's no food or drinks on the island so take everything with you, and the island's a lot bigger and more diverse than you might think. There's so much there that you should consider spending two full days on the island, traveling back and forth to Triabunna for the evenings."
Peaceful and stunning.,"We decided to stay 2 nights in Triabunna, to be able to enjoy a whole day on Maria Island.  We had arranged the night before for our ""free"" ferry ride to the island.  We were interested to find out what the catch was, as commercial operators do not typically provide services for free.  Well, much to our surprise, the ferry crossing was indeed free, with the State government paying $35 for each person they take to the island (go figure).We rented bikes for the day so we could enjoy more sights than if we walked. The bikes could have been of better quality.... the sound of my brakes scared away most of the wildlife! First stop was the Painted Cliffs before the tide made it hard to access.  These are sandstone rocks with infused minerals providing beautiful colors.  Next was the Fossil Cliffs, which plunge vertically into the sea and provide panoramic views.  Lastly was a visit to the old township of Darlington which served as one of many Australia's convict sites and is also a World Heritage Site.There is a rich wildlife scene on the island including the Cape Barren Goose which was nearly wiped out but is now off the endangered list.  There is also a Tasmanian Devil translocation project where they have moved 14 healthy Devils onto the island so they may naturally breed and be free of the nasty tumor disease that's killing them.All in all a very nice and rewarding visit."
Beautiful island but avoid the Maria Island Ferry,We travelled to Maria Island for a day trip. The scenery is beautiful and the wildlife is quite relaxed about the human presence. We would not recommend travelling over there with the Maria Island Ferry though. As we were on the road we chose to make our booking via phone rather than the internet - for some reason this was problematic and required 3 phone calls and 2 texts just to a return trip for two with bikes booked. The quality of the bikes was pretty ordinary. The first helmet I was given was broken and the front brakes of the bike kept jamming the whole way around the island.
stunning island,"A wonderful place to walk, swim and cycle. Very peaceful with stunning views and interesting historical and natural phenomena, as well as plentiful wildlife. I would recommend a day trip with tours tasmania, a no fuss, informative small group tour."
So beautiful and relaxing,"Finally got to Maria Island and it is amazing. The ferry ride is easy and there is plenty of time to do walks until the trip home. We did the Fossil Cliffs, Reservoir and Painted Cliffs and didn't need to rush. The island is full of wildlife including Cape Barren geese and wombats. Take everything you need as there is not much for sale. Ranger was very helpful. We will be back!"
Pristine Beach,"We took the Maria Island Ferry across. The proprietors are great Ann is very efficient and John world hard (and succeeding) to make the ferry an interesting experience. Book in summer, they are very busy.We had our own bikes which we rode from Darlington where the ferry stops to Ocean Beach. It's about 30km round trip through bush tracks  including 10km of sand. Hard work riding but the beach makes it worthwhile. It felt like no one had ever stepped on the beach before us. Truly memorable."
Stunning scenery and a perfect day+ trip!,"Maria Island was on our “Bucket List” (so to speak) and we were not disappointed in what the scenery and history had on offer!We caught a ferry on a weekday from Triabunna to Darlington/Maria Island (short boat trip across) and were fortunate enough to have perfect weather; approx. 23 degrees with a slight breeze. Now being from Melbourne, one could expect to wear a jumper on a 23 degree day, however you are sure to work up a sweat with plenty of walking tracks.Our first chosen walk was Fossil Cliffs (via The Miller’s House) which they suggest to allow 1.5-2hrs return.We were blown away by the amazing scenery of cliffs and fossils. To have the opportunity to actually climb down the cliffs (at your own risk) was just amazing.It was lovely to have this entire area to ourselves as a moderate fitness level is suggested.We continued our walk through to Painted Cliffs via Darlington and Hopground Beach.The Painted Cliffs were stunning and a must visit!We spent the entire day on the Maria Island and this was not long enough.Looking forward to returning someday in the future; we just hope that its rare beauty stays un-touched for many more years to come.NB. Make sure you take sufficient necessities not to be caught off-guard - food, water, rubbish bag, hat, sunscreen, sturdy walking shoes, National Parks Pass and of course a camera!"
Kids paradise,"No cars, safe for kids to enjoy themselves and parents and grandparents can relax in knowing that the kids are safe.beaches and lots of wildlife to keep them enthralled. The walks are not hard but the fossil cliffs especially would interest anyone with any imagination. Great camping areas and the boat trip over is an added bonus"
A great weekend,"We took the 9am ferry from Tribunna to Darlington for a weekend of cycling, we had booked a room fro the night in the Penitentiary and after dropping our bags off we set out on our bikes to Frenches farm. After all the rain Tassie has had lately the tracks were heavy going, but the wildlife and scenery was amazing. The accommodation was basic but functional.  Highly recommend Maria Island as either a day trip or overnight stay."
Simply wonderful,"After the short drive from Hobart we loaded our gear on the ferry for our 3 day adventure on this Natural Island. There were 10 of us and we stayed in a room at the Penitentiary. Close by was the mess hall, free BBQ's, open fires, gas burners, hot & cold water, showers and toilets. There is wildlife everywhere. At your front door you have Cape Barren Geese, Wombats, Possums, Wallobys and more. It is like living in a zoo without the fences. The Island is great for short or long walks. The views and scenery are breath taking. There are good tracks to different parts of the island. Many used bikes to get around. We walked to Frenchs Farm camping ground which has frsh water and toilet. We passed white beaches, a few historic buildings, forest and saw heaps of wild life. The old ruins from convict prison days are interesting to look through too. We  really needed more time to do the island justice. It's quiet with no cars except the rangers. There were a lot of people at the camp ground however we didn't see many people during the day as everyone was off somewhere.Taking a bicycle is a good idea. You would get around quicker. They do hire them on the Island for $20. We will definely go back one day to do more."
Walk your legs off - tranquil and mournful setting,"We took advantage of the free winter ferry service from Triabunna to Darlington.  We were lucky enough to have a whale alongside the boat inside Spring Bay off Triabunna which was a visual and emotional treat for all on board.  Darlington is the only settlement on the island and is a World Heritage site administered by National Parks and Wildlife.  Darlington  was a convict station in the early 1800's and there are still a few remaining convict buildings.  The cement silo's built by an Italian entrepreneur in the early 1900's still tower skeleton like over the waterfront.  If you head over to Maria for a day trip time is limited.  Still, we had time to inspect the heritage buildings in Darlington, walk to the painted cliffs on the West Coast and then the Fossil Cliffs on the East Coast - plus a nap on the beach in the sun.    The lands just outside Darlington are infested with Wombats - obviously in plague proportions as these nocturnal marsupials are out in daylight trying to graze enough feed.  Cape Barren Geese abound and there are plenty of Wallaby in the bush if you get off the road.Some of the day trippers took the opportunity to climb Bishop and Clerk (peaks on north Maria Island) instead of our time spent near Darlington.Overall a great day out for us - and Triabunna is only an hours drive from Hobart.The ferry is no longer free but I think that the price is relatively insignificant.  National Parks passes are required to enter onto the island."
A Hidden Gem,"We camped overnight on the island. It has a very pleasant camping ground with access to a large sheltered basic camp kitchen with free BBQs and gas burners for cooking. You need to bring everything with you for cooking, but this wasn't an issue. There are also a toilet and shower facilities nearby. We loved camping here with all the geese, native hens, wombats and a few cheeky possums around. There is plenty to see and do on the island, exploring the convict era buildings, walking or cycling around the island is pleasant. We visited the fascinating Fossil Cliffs and the beautiful Painted Cliffs.Can't wait to get back to further explore Maria Island in the summer."
Take advantage of the free ferry in winter!,"Beautiful place, especially when there are not too many visitors.Hope the tassie devil project works out"
Maria Island is a must visit,I spent a day on Maria Island and it was delightful. Steeped in convict history and covered in all manner of wildlife. A high level of fitness is not required to wander around this island. You can do as little or as much as you want. Absolutely amazing to see wombats roaming around and grazing like sheep. A real joy to see them outside a zoo environment.Park pass required to visit here. Had a lovely journey over on the Maria Island Ferry.
Make the trip over,"My husband and I traveled over to the island for the with Maria Island Cruises and took our bicycles, which we recommend doing if you are only there for the day and want to get to see a bit of the island.  There are also bikes to hire on the island.  Wombats and Cape Barron Geese wander about the grounds of the old penitentiary with apparent little fear of humans.  So much to see, we need to go back another time.  Just remember to take your own food as there is nothing but a coffee machine over there."
Great Weekend For All The Family,"We recently stayed in the Penetentiary Units for one night with four children under 8, they all had a great time on their bikes riding around Darlington some of the gravel roads were a bit hard going for the kids bikes but no problems for adult riding. Make sure you take plenty of food as we underestimated just how much the children would eat over 2 days. The wombats were fantastic the only downside were the Geese they were quite aggressive and would fly at the children if they accidently got too close which was hard because one of them was nesting next to the toilets!"
Free Ferry to Maria Island and visit,"From the trip on the ferry across, with a wonderful Crew who were very helpful and friendly, to the staff at the rangers office and the walks, it was a magical day. It was so much more than we expected and can't wait to go back again. Next time we hope to stay over night. Very easy walking tracks, with so many wombats wandering around some with babies something to see every few minutes. White white sand and blue sea like the Greek islands ! So relaxing, only the noise of the sea and birds and cheery heollos from the other walkers as you pass them. Do yourself a favour and go. The buildings are great too and lots of information boards"
Unexpected delight,"There are free winter ferry services to Maria Island and our party of eight took advantage of this service today. It cost $10 to take a bike across on the ferry or you can hire them from the rangers station for $20 a day (geared bikes with suspension and helmets included in charge). The island offers a range of activities, the beautiful scenery, the abundant wildlife - there were so many wombats we initially thought they were rocks and the history of the many buildings. The more eager in our group cycled to French's Farm then returned inland along a challenging and hilly track. The coastal roads are all manageable for novice riders but if you love taking photographs (there are so many opportunities) walking could be the best option. We all loved it so much we are planning a return overnight trip. I will be bringing all my interstate visitors to Maria Island from now on - it is suitable for visits even from elderly people. One thing to consider - Maria Island is a national park and you need  a parks pass to visit. These are available from the visitors centre on the island."
Unspoilt Gem,"We took advantage of the free ferry trip running during winter to spend the day on this remarkable island. We walked, but there are bikes available to hire, from the jetty to Painted Cliffs and then back to the Fossil Cliffs.The scenery we saw was spectacular, wide open grassed areas, cool wooded glades, sheer cliffs, sandy beaches, quiet lagoons and always the water either the ocean or Mercury Passage not too far away. The wildlife was abundant  and the variety of vegetation on a small island diverse.  I was surprised at the quality and number of the heritage buildings. The view from Ruby's Cottage: prime real estate.Do bring a camera and comfortable walking shoes and own supplies as no shops on the island, I was dying for a coffee, plus $$ for Park Pass. The tracks we walked were easy and well maintained.Take advantage of the free ferry trip till Sept 1 you wont be disappointed."
Have to see,"I love Maria island, the history, the flora and fauna and the camping. A nights stay at the penitentairy is a must experience, sleeps 6 people and in winter the ferry service is free.There are 2 ferris to the island and I strongly recommend Eco cruises, mike is a great guy and the staff is helpful and fantastic. You can cycle or walk, no cars, ext nt park vehicles, the island is also accessible from orfort via small craft or a nice kayak trip.Encampment cove is good for camping, fishing or just a nice walk along the the history of tassie.The ismes is sandy, but worth the walk to Robbies hut or haunted bay.The isand is good for a day trip or a weekend, if you want to stay longer, make sure you are not far from French's hut, more water than at encampment cove"
Worth a trip just for the wildlife,"Camped on Maria Island June 2013. Walked to French's farm where we felt like the only people in the world. Spent the second night in the Penitentiary accommodation. Very cosy with logburners!Saw so much wildlife walking in, all the marsupials you would expect, as well as some sealife on the beaches. We spoke to someone who claimed they saw whales too. Unfortunately, we didn't hear the squeals of any devils though there were sightings listed in a visitors book (maybe try the south part of the island).The history is extensive. We walked down to the ruins near Lesueur Point, and around Darlington.Will return for some more walking in the future!"
Convict History-unknown treasures of Maria Island.,"Wow! Patriotic Aussies must visit !  Our history - ( Penal settlement set up  5 years BEFORE Port Arthur)  A world heritage listed probation station no less but so unknown & so well preserved !Buildings that housed convicts used as accommodation, Coffee Palace to wander thru, colonial buildings,the 2 roomed ''house'' where O'Brien an Irish political prisoner was housed,his poetry, the old pottery  works building you stumble across as you walk to Fossil Cliffs. etc etc .Stunning scenery of cliffs ,fossilized shells quarried once to supply cement made on the island. Several families lived here, farming etc until the last person buried in the cemetry in 1941.Triabunna on the mainland is where u catch the ferry. We ( parents & 2 daughters in 20s) stayed at Triabunna Caravan Park which  supplied books in our cabin to fill in the historical gaps . Great resource . Thankyou ! The cabin was small but for 2 nights (pre & post  ferry trip ) was fine. A double bed up one end & 4 bunks at other , was extremely clean & had all a motel room would have . We went free on the ferry on Thursday of Queens Birthday weekend 2013(last weekend) . People missed bookings for Sat as all booked out . June trips were free. They had to pay to go on another charted boat . National Parks subsidized the free trips .  It meant Winter work for National Parks Rangers too. Weather was fine , cool until 3:30pm when wind turned colder & stronger. It was hard walking , coming back to jetty from along airsrtip. We walked but you can cycle around the island to different places. Many did. We only did the walk to the Fossil Cliffs in our day trip but we had a slower member. Grey haired people cycled or walked or just stayed  around the main area, young people with their small children cycled or were going to camp. You can camp  ( no booking required  & camping fees only for Darlington campground) or day trip too. Otherwise a mattress is supplied in the Convict Quarters called The Penitentiary .Also a Coonara type wood heater  & 6 bunks in each. There is the Convict's Mess Hall too where there is free coffee/tea & tables etc.Showers($1) & toilets  & a laundry are nearby  the Convict's Quarters.Bird poo all  in the grass as the Cape Barren Geese never seem to leave the place.So no barefoot walking off the verandah .Hah! Some people spotted 5 wombats . We saw one close to the jetty just before the 4pm ferry arrived  & a big mob of kangaroos near airfield.The staff are all so Friendly.(Maybe because they are employed over Winter! )Both on the island & on the ferry. Bicycles & all a person's gear were taken on board for free. Free trolleys available at jetty to transport your gear. You must take all your needs with you- no shops. Water on tap. We took bread rolls,fruit & nuts & thermoses.I saw no rubbish bins - take it home with you . We caught the 10:30 am ferry & returned on the 4pm .Watching videos in the Commissariat Store  ( good shelter & activity if weather poor ). Had tea at the white pub near the jetty. Nice food but felt it was dear. Lovely friendly , helpful staff . Go early if a busy weekend like Queens Birthday as pub doesn't have many tables. You might try the Art Gallery cafe opposite chemist. Seems new . Could be better value . There are two pubs , one on the highway. I am enthused to return in Summer & swim & cycle & snorkle.Colourful life under the water at the jetty . Parts of the waters are a Marine Reserve .So much natural beauty, Australian history & uncommercialized environment .Not just another National Park . You need aTasmanian National Parks membership too. Can get  membership on the island. (?) Go & enjoy .  You can volunteer to help on projects around the island.  Volunteers were white washing buildings while we were there .Let's hope Triabunna can cope & grow but not to the extreme end of the commercial market .  Jill"
Beautiful relaxing outdoor holiday,"Took a group of 29 people to Maria Island at the weekend.Rich in history, native animals,scenery and more.Great for bush walking,bike riding or just strolls around the old convict settlement.We camped in Darlington at the dedicated camp ground.There was ample space,a large camp kitchen with free gas bbqs and gas rings.Also includes stainless steel work benches and picnic tables.There was also a kitchen sink with hot & cold running water.The bathroom facilities include flushing loos and showers operated with dollar coins.Free firewood is provided to stoke the two open fire places in the centre of the camp kitchen.So pleasant to sit around at night.It was the busiest weekend on the island since 2009 and there was plenty of room for all.Wonderful place to visit.If you want something a little more luxurious perhaps consider a guided tour with ""Maria Island Walk"" winners of multiple tourism awards."
Must do if you're in Tasmania,"This was the absolute highlight of my time in Tasmania.  The island was so beautiful.  You make your way to the island via a 35 minute ferry ride, which you can arrange by contacting Maria Island Ferry.  This cost $35 return, although they are running free ferry service this winter.You will see wild kangaroos, wombats, geese, rabits, etc.  I've heard that people have even photographed Tasmanian Devil footprints.As far as I understand the only options for accommodation on the island is the old penitentiary(where we stayed), or camping.  The penitentiary was excellent, providing six bunk beds per room, a fire place, and table.  There is no electricity in the room so be sure to bring a flashlight.  Also you will need to bring a pillow and sleeping bag.  This cost $44 a night, but again, during winter I believe this price will be lower.There is no store on the island, so be sure to bring enough food, water, and medical supplies if you require them.There is electricty in the mess hall, including hot water, and a stove.  There are separate toilets for men and women, as well as hot showers available for $1.You could easily spend a week here walking around, and taking in all the nature.I could not recommend this place enough for people who enjoy the beauty of nature.  My only word of caution:The boat ride across was quite difficult for me.  I have never suffered motion sickness in my life, however, I felt extremely sea-sick on this excursion (the numerous children on the boat, however, seemed totally unaffected, and loved the bumps).  I spoke to the captain of the boat, and he assured me that no one had ever been ill on the ride (and if I'm not mistaken he's been doing this for 9 years!)  If you are prone to motion sickness I would suggest taking a motion sickness pill prior.  It is most definitely NOT worth missing this beautiful place due to a little sea sickness!"
Very picturesque,"This is a beautiful place.I recommend the Bishop and Clerk walk, which takes you to the top of some dolomite columns on the coast.  Signs suggest the walk takes 3-5 hours.  We are young and fit and did it in 4.5 on a cool day. In one day we did the Bishop and Clerk walk and visited the fossil cliffs and painted cliffs - I think we saw the best parts of the island.  It was worth getting up early to spend a whole day there.  You can also rent bikes and have quite an easy cycle along the coast.There are no shops on the island so be sure to take plenty of food and water.  It would be a great place to take a picnic."
"Maria Island Walk, Tasmania","Words are inadequate. The landscape, the views, the beaches, the wonderful young, knowledgeable and professional guides, the food and wine - all contribute to an unforgettable experience. Great for the body, even better for the soul. Maria Island should not be missed.Winnie P"
Not to be missed,"A fabulous few days cared and guided by experienced, fun young guides. Great company, wonderful food and breathtaking views . Well worth the effort and cost .Do it ."
"Divine - scenery, food & wine","Just one of the most gorgeous places in the world. If it was anywhere else there would be hundreds of tourists trampling all over it.  This is a pristine, barely touched part of Australia. Maria Island Walk allows you to visit in plenty of comfort but their eco-huts and facilities are only adding to the care of this environment. Knowledgable and experienced and fun guides, beautiful Tassie food and wine. A pretty special 4days."
"Breathtaking trip, do it now with Maria Is Walks.","Couldn't fault it. Fun, well informed guides, great accommodation, amazing food and wine, fantastic walks and such an incredibly beautiful place. If you are considering doing this walk, stop procrastinating and do it!"
Painted Cliff in Maria Island,"Somebody may missed this small island.The most attractive scenes of this island are two cliffs.Especially the Painted Cliff.It just like a paintwork.Fantastic!From Hobart to Triabunna need 1.5 hours drive, then take ferry 30 minutes to the island.AUD 35 ferry fare - round trip. 10:30 go and 16:00 back.Need National Park Entrance Pass.No food / restaurant in the island."
Natural and human history wonderland,"Maria island is a natural and human history wonderland. At first we were disappointed that we couldn't get bikes but it was a blessing is disguise.  If we had bikes the emphasis would have been on the bike ride and not what we were seeing. We walked about 8.5kms on the island saw loads of wildlife (wombats, wallabies, kangaroos, cape barren geese, and loads of other birds), awesome natural features such as the painted cliffs and fossils plus convict ruins. Any trip to Tassie should include this Maria Island."
Amazing place to visit.,"We took a day trip to Maria Island in February 2013. We took the Maria Island Ferry which was great. The staff on board were friendly and very helpful in their recommendations for our visit to the island.The ferry drops off at the northern end and there are a number of walks ranging in length to easily fill in a full day. We planned to do the Bishop and Clerk climb, but unfortunately the weather was bad (peak shrouded in fog and constant drizzle would have made for some slippery boulder scrambling). Instead we visited the painted cliffs, the fossil cliffs, the reservoir and the Darlington township. The fossil cliffs in particular were fascinating, with great views of the larger cliffs towards Bishop and Clerk.Wildlife on the island is abundant and the scenery is just beautiful. Given the opportunity to visit again I would definitely do the 4 day Maria Island walk.Bikes can be rented through the ferry operators or at the welcome centre on the island. A parks pass is required to visit and must be shown on arrival to the island.No food is available for purchase on the island and there are no bins. Therefore you must bring all your own food with you and take all the rubbish back to mainland Tasmania.If you have the time, make the most of it and do the 4 day walk, otherwise a day trip is highly recommended."
Absolutely Perfect - four days of magic at Maria Island,"My husband and my family in law celebrated my father in laws 60th at Maria Island by doing the four day walking holiday at Maria Island and wow, what a way to celebrate!!I can't speak any higher of the wonderful guides who were full of history, information, stories and on top of that, were patient, caring and the BEST CHEFS ever!! The food was delicious and I am very picky! Settling in for a glass of red wine at night by candlelight and surrounded by great company was unforgettable - wonderful without TV, phones or the internet!The magical scenery, cliffs, mountains, beaches, wildlife and views we experienced were incredible. We couldn't have asked for anymore. The accomodation was extremely cosy and comfortable - glamping at it's best.I was always worried about the walking side of things with this holiday and taking our own packs but after the first half day, it didn't bother me at all!! It was relatively easy. Walking up Bisphop and Clerk and Mount Maria was a little hard but extremely satisfying and worth it -the views, wow!!A huge thank you to everyone at Maria Island for a wonderful holiday that brought the family together in nature, it was honestly PERFECT! x"
I thought Bruny Island was good but this is better.,We took a Cruise/Walk Tour of Maria Island (only a leisurely 1.30 hour drive from Hobart). The cruise (3 hrs duration) starts from Triabunna with a short crossing to Maria Island & drop of for those passengers not taking the cruise. Cruise commences in a clockwise direction  to Mistaken Cape and lastly dropping anchor at Riedle Bay before a return journey the same way we came. The scenery throughout is simply amazing with magnificent high cliffs of varying rock formations/fossil cliffs + sea caves including one which the cruise boat went entirely inside (Awesome). Add to that a host of spring fed waterfalls some of which came out of the rock face. Saw one lonely seal sunning itself on the rock. On our return did a walking tour to the solitary buildings on the Island at the Darlington Settlement. There are ruins a plenty from many years ago when it was a penal colony inhabited by convicts. Huge history surrounds the Island. No roads as such (quite unique) but plenty of walking trails and accommodation to take it all in. Loved the day and would highly recommend to any visitor to Tasmania.
Magnificent Maria,"Just spent 3 days on beautiful Maria Island with friends. Walked up Bishop & Clerk, a 4-5 hr return hike where the views from the top north towards Freycinet Peninsula were stunning. As the island is all National Park and you take all food, drink etc. it appeals very much to self reliant people who are into hiking, bird watching, swimming, cycling and just having a great time without the technology. If you are into watching wombats up close, the antics of native hens, night walks to see Water Rats, Little Penguins and Muttonbirds then Maria is the place to go. And then there is the fantastic scenery; fossil cliffs, painted cliffs, history from convict probation station to an Italian entrepreneur's enterprises of vineyards, silkworms and grand hotels, to cement works etc. etc. Its a great place to get away and truly relax."
Amazing Maria!,"Just did the Maria island walk with 3 friends. It is a truly beautiful place, so much wildlife and some of the most amazing beaches i have ever seen! The guides Alana and Daniel were fantastic, nothing too much trouble for them. They produced great food from their packs, don't know how they did it! Also great Tassie wines with all the meals. The walk is not too hard and carrying the pack was fine, as they fit them so well. There are optional harder walks available every day if you want to extend yourself. If you are thinking about doing the Maria Island walk , go for it you will not be disappointed!"
Try not to miss this island,"This is truly a special place. Simply take a reasonably priced ferry here because there is no vehicle traffic allowed, except the park service vehicles. We rented bikes for the day, from the ferry operators also reasonably priced, and explored the island down to the neck at Chinamans Bay. Beyond here it is too sandy to bike well. The ruins of the penal colony are very informative of the attitude toward convicts at the time. The Painted Cliffs are gorgeous and the beaches inviting. We ate our lunch at the bay and went for a swim. The water was so clear, as it is all along the west side of the island. We are so glad we took the day here."
Maria island Tasmania,"We recently spent 3 nights on Maria Island with 2 other couples staying in the old penetentiary which is basic accommodation in bunk beds.  You need to take all your food and  bedding as there are no shops on the island.  However there is a great dining area with gas hotplates, sink for washing up etc and it has lighting at night.  You have to provide your own lights in your room.  There are several easy walks to take and swimming is good near the jetty and at the painted cliffs beach.  The climb up Mt Bishop and Clerk is fairly tough for the last half hour but the view is amazing.  Take plenty mossie repellent as they are vicious!  A lovely peaceful place with a very interesting history and the museum is very good"
Unexpected walk turns out to be marvellous,"We were a group of 7 travellers (5 Australians and we 2 Canadians) who had signed up to take a Freycinet Experience walk  (see my comments under Freycincet experience), but due to the bush fires in Tasmania, we were unable to do that trip and were accommodated by Maria Island walks. We were very apprehensive about carrying  backpacks and had many questions that were answered patiently by Richard.  Although they are wonderful packs, one should not underestimate the difficulty of carrying them when one is not accustomed to doing so.  We were very fortunate that Nate, the guide / handyman was able to change his schedule inorder to transport our packs, which made all the difference to all of us.  We really appreciated that flexiblity of everyone involved  I have little to add to the fantastic review by Grogsblossom except to concur with everything written there.  We had 2 fabulous guides, Hannah and Daniel who cooked for us, walked with us, took care of us, always with a huge smile and good humour.  Our group was great and lots of fun and the scenery spectacular.  The ""tents"" were extremely comfortable, the food and wine excellent with lots of variety, the night skies brilliant and covered by stars.   This was an unbelievable experience that was extremely well organized, leaving nothing to chance. We loved it and as long as you are happy to carry a backpack, would recommend it to everyone.  Thank you for an experience that we will always remember."
Great people / walks / landscapes / animals / food /... everything !,"We've done this walk with my girlfriend around Xmas 2012.The organization is really amazing : - Two guides are always available, so we (almost) have three choices : 1) a big walk 2) a moderate walk 3) just staying at the camp enjoying the beach. It's perfect when the group is not uniform.- The food is so good, especially when you know that it's carried by the guides ! Fresh, local, original, diversified. And as I have multiple food allergies... the whole crew took really care of me ! And about the drinks... what a pleasure to end a big walk with a fresh (ginger) beer and/or a glass of Tasmanian wine (every day a different one !)- The campgrounds are very well thought, and really close to the ocean. It's so good getting asleep with the sound of waves.- The provided backpacks are magic : we've nearly not felt our packages  (and most of the time, you don't carry your full package, only a light day pack, with all your stuff left at the campground).- Our two guides were top : great stories, super chefs, thank youThe Island is sooooo beautiful :- The animals : wombats, kangaroos, echidnas, penguins, birds, snakes, etc- The view on the isthmus when you are on the top of Mount Maria (this is a very strenuous walk, but the view is  totally worth the climbing !)- The beaches- The HistoryIn short : amazing trip, the motto ""Four days that will last a lifetime"" is totally right."
Hidden gem,"We had three nights camping at Darlington. Fantastic experience. Great cycling and walks. Crystal clear water for swimming - next time will take snorkelling gear. Good camping facilities, just remember to take 1 dollar coins for hot shower. We will definitely go again."
The Maria Island Walk - 4 Fabulous Days,"The trek consists of 8 guests and 2 guides and comprises the following format: Day One collection from your hotel in Hobart for a briefing at The Maria Island Walk office before the hour long drive to Triabunna where you board a private boat to the south of Maria Island.  After lunch on a beautiful beach it is a short walk to the camp concealed in trees.  The afternoon is at leisure with the option to trek, swim or just relax in camp.  Day Two involves a longer trek taking in a deserted farm where the group stops for coffee/tea, lunch at the convict settlement at Port Lesueur and, in the afternoon, the crossing of 5 different beaches to reach the second camp, nestled in the forest above another lovely beach.  Day Three is an easier trek to the deserted town of Darlington, via the astonishing Painted Cliffs.  In Darlington, accommodation is in the charming colonial period Bernacci House, the former home of charismatic entrepreneur Diego Bernacci.  The afternoon is at leisure for strolling round the town and it's immaculately restored buildings, choosing from a number of scenic but easy walks or climbing either Mount Maria or Bishop and Clerk.  The morning of Day Four is 'at leisure' to explore more of the locality and its fascinating history before a champagne lunch and the boat ride back to Triabunna and thence to Hobart.My husband and I had never trekked with back-packs and were a bit anxious that we might find it difficult, but the walking was easy, the rests frequent and we never felt fatigued. The Maria Island Walk also provide a very thorough kit list when you sign up for the trek, which proved invaluable.  They also supply super-comfy back packs.Although Maria Island is quite small - 19km by 13km - the stunning scenery is wild and varied and is home to a variety of birds and animals - some only found in Tasmania.  The standard of guiding over the four days was exceptional - enhanced by the ratio of guides to guests.  Information about the flora, fauna and the indigenous peoples who settled periodically on the Island, to the more recent whalers and farmers, was first rate and infused with a passion for the Island.  The quality and variety of the meals was astonishing and we enjoyed superb three-course candlelit dinners, complimented by different Tasmanian wines, each evening.  The choice of breakfast changed daily, always including a hot option.  The camps on nights 1 and 2 were extremely well constructed, ensuring maximum privacy with a sound eco-orientation.  Water conservation is a priority, so showers were not available until we reached Bernacci House.  However, the washroom provision at both camps was entirely adequate.  Bernacci House was charmingly furnished in the colonial stye and we enjoyed log fires, a library and fresh linen on the comfortable beds.Notwithstanding, none of the above conveys the magic of Maria Island, which has to be experienced to be believed - it truly is Caliban's enchanted isle: ""full of ... sounds and sweet airs, that give delight...""  Spending four days exploring it, seldom seeing anyone else, walking amongst wallabies and creeping close to wombats, following the tracks of tassie devils and swimming in its crystal clear waters - this island has everything for the nature-lover and yet still keeps a little back for itself.  We cannot recommend the experiene of The Maria Island Walk more highly.  As a postscript I should like to mention that, flying into Hobart on the evening before the commencement of the trek, we found that our luggage, including all our trekking gear, was still in Melbourne.  We rang The Maria Island Office and, despite the lateness of the hour - about 10pm - the staff responded superbly, taking all the details and dealing with Quantas on our behalf.  They assured us that, if the luggage didn't turn up the following morning, they would organise an alternative excursion for us until such time as it did arrive, after which we could join the trek. The calmness and efficiency of their response did much to ease what was a stressful 12 hours.  In the event, the luggage was waiting for us at the airport the next morning, not in small measure due to the efforts of the team at The Maria Island Walk."
Natural beauty and a haunting history,We had a really memorable day visiting this unspoilt gem and finding out about its history as a transportation destination for convicts. The painted rocks and fossil cliffs are awe inspiring but the visit to the convict cemetery and internment buildings were compelling. There were moving stories told of the experiences of those who were transported.
Bikes are a great way to explore if you've only got one day,"The ferry trip to Maria Island is short but interesting (especially if you're lucky enough to see whales which we unfortunately werent).As you arrive you'll notice the long white sand beaches and the old ruins on the hill. We'd hired bikes from the ferry company (only $20 a day they were a bargain) and set off to see as much as we could.The painted cliffs are a must, and very accessible. Then we headed down to 4 mile beach for a lovely picnic on the deserted beach. After that it was a ride through the bush to French's Farm, along the way we saw wallabies, wombats and a big lizard sunning itself on the track. It was a great way to spend the day.By the time we got back; checked out the visitor centre and the old graveyard and washed the bikes we'd done about 24km and used up all of our day. We were tired but happy on the way back across.Fish and Chips at the caravan next to the wharf in Triabunna were a great way to finish the day"
Maria Island 4 Day Guided Walk - Incredible!,"Having not been a fan of camping since childhood, I had a few reservation about this trip.  However, it really is what my daughter calls (Glamping).  An incredible experience, filled with breathtaking views, wildlife, history, flora and delectable food.  Our guides (Sarah & Dayna) informative and enthusiastic for us to explore the island.  Both ladies instilled confidence in our group to extend and climb, the reward a most magnificent view from top of Bishop & Clerk.  Thankyou ladies for your attention to detail in all ways, whether we were climbing a peak or sitting down to your fantastic catering.  Indeed an amazing experience to share with a group of great people and two highly experienced and passionate guides.Thanks again to the staff & guides of the 4 Day Maria Island WalkLisa & Peter J"
3 Days Walking on Maria Island,"We were a group of 8 people ranging in age from 12 to 65 years old, with 3 guides. After a rough ride across to Maria Island the weather picked up. After sorting out our sleeping quarters in the old penitentiary we headed off towards Bishop and Clerk stopping on the way to look at and hear about the Fossil Cliffs. There were wonderful views over the water on the way up and on the way back to Darlington we encountered lots of wombats, kangaroos, wallabies and Cape Barren Geese. The  second  day we did a 25 km walk to Encampment Cove and return to Darlington. Unfortunately the tide was too high, so we were unable to see the Painted Cliffs.But we had lunch at the historic remnants of Frenchs Farm. On our last day we managed a short walk to the Reservoir. Maria Island is a natural, peaceful place with no development and only old historic buildings other than a shower block and the Rangers Office. There are animals,birds and lovely scenery. Our guides were able to cook up fantastic meals in the Mess Hall on gas BBQs for us, including roast shoulder of lamb,Thai chicken curry, omelettes, crepes and berries and pavlova."
"Nice, but a bit boring","Best take a picnic for day trips as there is not much of anything on the island.  I  only went for the day and it was quietly pleasant, Im sure a great place for peace and quiet camping and walking. The beach was lovely, the animals and history great. Im a local so it is probably a bit more interesting for interstate visitors."
Maria Island is a zoo,"An entire National Park 'girt by sea' ... ferry leaves from Triabunna, takes 30minutes, runs all weather and no-one is left on the island.  Quiet beaches to camp by, 1000m mountain called 'Bishop and Clerk' on which to scrabble for exquisite marine views, vestiges of convict buildings, and soon to have Tasmanian devils introduced, to cull all those darn wombats, wallabies, kangaroos, pademelons, native hens and Cape Barron geese!  Get there this year to walk wild in a natural zoo!"
Serenity,"Peaceful place, great camping with toilets, BBQs and showers. Great for kids with heaps of space to ride bikes. You have to take everything on the ferry with you but there is a lot of space. Walk to Bishop and Clerk for fantastic views.Keep an eye on the wombats!"
Maria Island Walk,"Sensational guided walk.  3 nights/4 days of nature, great company and wonderful meals.   Small groups of 8-10 ... Experienced, informative and fun guides.  I'd recommend this walk with this company to anyone from easy walkers to those who enjoy a challenge.  Thanks to all at Maria Island Walks."
New year Walking Tour,"My wife and I had considered the Island walk and decided to put on our back packs this year and were not disappointed .Mariah Island Walks were wonderfully professional,the camp sites first class,it was great to arrive tired after the days trekking to be met with an array of cold Tassy beer or wine and great food.The history of the Island is fascinating,the guides were patient and knowledgeable .It was a great 5 star experience"
Photographers Paradise,"You catch the ferry from Triabunna to Maria Island. There are several forms of accommodation on the island. We stayed in a room at the old convict penitentiary cells at Darlington. There are gas heated pay showers available. You need to take a sleeping bag, cooking utensils, food etc. We hired a bike and rode down to French's Farm and Encampment Cove. On the way back we stopped off at the Painted Cliffs to take a few shots. We also climbed Bishop & Clerk about a 5 hour walk from Darlington. There is an amazing amount of wildlife on the island. Plenty of wallabies, kangaroos and wombats. There are a few Cape Barren Geese at Darlington. A great place to photograph the wildlife and the spectacular scenery in general. A National Parks pass is required (as with all of Tasmania's National Parks)."
The best place in Tasmania,"Maria Island is an incredibly special place. Nowhere else do you have such a feeling of truly escaping from the world. We have just returned from one of many long weekends there. As a veteran Maria Island goer here are some bits and pieces about visiting the island.There are no shops on the island. You must bring all your gear/ food with you and take all your rubbish off the island with you(dont be put off, this is whats special about the place). Water is available at Darlington and Frenchs Farm. There is a Parks and Wildlife office at Darlington. They can assist with info on your visit. Parks entrance fees apply. You will arrive by ferry via Triabunna. Either Eastcoast cruises or Maria Island Ferry will take you. return is about $35 with bikes an extra $10.Day tripsIf you are able, go by bike. You can see such alot of the island this way even for a day trip. painted cliffs, fossil cliffs, four mile creek and maybe even Frenchs farm are possible as day trips on a bike if you are not staying overnight. It would take maybe 1 hour to Frenchs farm on a bike (it took us 2 1/2 hours to walk there). if you went to Frenchs farm on a bike you would see painted cliffs and four mile creek on the way. Painted cliffs you can only see at low tide though. The riding would require a medium level of fitness. it is on formed gravel or sandy roads all the way. The part from four mile creek to Frenchs Farm is a bit sandy in places and requires a bit of bike pushing here and there. Bikes are available to hire for i think about $20. Enquire with Parks and Wildlife before you go or you can take your own on the ferry ($10).For those not able to ride a bike you can walk from Darlington to Fossil cliffs and /or painted cliffs. Also dont forget to allow an hour or two to look around Darlington. The old buildings are so interesting and photogenic. The old coffee palace has been partly restored and you can spend some time in there reading and looking at old memorabelia. For those more adventurous Mt Maria and Bishop and Clerk are possible as day walks.Overnight at Darlington.To really enjoy the remoteness and peacefulness of this lovely place, stay overnight. You can camp at Darlington. There are bbq facilites, toilets and hot showers (coin operated)You can also stay in the old penitentiary. Facilities are basic (a bit like camping inside) but comfortable. There are bunk beds (with matresses)for 6 people, a table with seats and a great wood heater in each room plus a sort of bench where you can cook. Best though is that all 10 room open onto a big shared veranda that looks over the ruins, coffee palace and water. The shared atmosphere is lovely. Rooms dont have power or running water. A water tank is nearby and toilets are close. You need to book ahead via Parks and WildlifeAs you can imagine, there is a bit of gear you will need to bring and there are large trolleys available on the jetty for you to transport you stuff to the rooms or campsite. For those of you who can carry an overnight pack, you can walk to Frenchs farm and camp overnight. There is also a campsite at encampment cove but has less of an escape modern life feel about is as people with boats tend to camp here. There is a lovely old farm house at Frenchs farm which has been restored. Lots of room for camping and toilet and water available. From Frenchs farm day trips to Robeys farm and Haunted bay (both full days in themselves) are possible as well as shorter walks to the convict cells and bloodstone point.Well i could go on and on about how fabulous this place is. Countless beautiful beaches to explore. convict and farming history to soak up. Incredible natural beauty. Would thoroghly recommend."
Go with Eastcoast Cruises,"-My husband wanted to go.  I went along.-We were picked up in Hobart by the wonderful steve.-Out to Triabunna and then off for a few hours os bird, fur seal, cave, and penguin sighting.-On out boat was a company employee on her day off - this is how much they love the job!-Then a few hours touring the island with the majestic painted cliffs, cute animals, and convict history.-Driven back to Hobart.-Worth every penny.http://www.eastcoastcruises.com.au/"
Natural beauty,A real experience. The painted cliffs were amazing. A wee paradise with a real history.
Perfection  in walking tours.,"A group of 9 girlfriends did a walk on Maria with ""Maria Island Walk"", after deciding Tasmania was to be our destination. This company has the exercise of looking after guests, and the environment, down  to a fine art. Our gorgeous guides, specially chosen to meld with our group made the trip. They were diligent, yet uncomplicated. Engaging yett unobtrusive. The walk was gentle, the terrain was spectacular, the environment kept in pristine condition. They are proud of the fact that their footprint is a very subtle one. Lots of history, lots of wildlife, and us kept fed and watered in delightful Tasmanian style with delicious wines and gourmet meals. A little challenge at the end with a more arduous hill climb, but pride at accomplishing the task....And the views were spectacular."
Glorious experience,Myself and 4 family members did the 4-day walk and found it exhilarating and very well organised. We struck excellent weather for the 4 days - but if you are unlucky enough to experience rain or cold winds it could be daunting. The tents and bunks are comfortable and the food superb. You have to be prepared to carry your personal items up to about 9kg in a backpack and the longest walk is 14km. There are steeper options for the fitter travellers.
Simply beautiful,"We did a day trip over to Maria Island National Park, taking the Maria Island Ferry to get there. There are no shops or anything much in the way of facilities on the island, except for 2 toilet blocks, so take everything you may need with you. We packed a picnic lunch and hired bicycles from the ferry company, which was a great advantage to get a bit further around the island than the walkers. Maria Island was once a convict settlement and many of the buildings from that time still remain. It was interesting to wander around the buildings in the small settlement of Darlington. Only national park rangers live permanently on the island and they are also the only ones with vehicles there, so bicycling and walking on the gravel roads is quite safe. The real island is to be seen in its natural beauty, with the mountains of Bishop and Clerk and Mount Maria dominating the landscape. Only the western side of the island is accessible to people and there are walks to the top of the mountains for the fit and adventurous. Birds and butterflies are prolific on the island and walking among the hordes of Cape Barren Geese and native flightless birds was a real joy. As the birds have no predators, including the human variety, they are very tame and you can get close up for that great photo shot. There are beautiful secluded beaches and if you have a bike or are an intrepid walker, you can find plenty of scenic spots all to yourself, except for the ever present Cape Barren Geese that seem to be everywhere you are. I've now added to my ""bucket list"" a night or two over on Maria Island and will definitely be back another time for the solitude, peace and natural stunning beauty of the place. Do go and enjoy, but please remember don't leave anything behind as this is pristine countryside.There are no rubbish bins or facilities at all for rubbish removal, so everything you take in, must be taken out again. Camping is available and also basic accommodation in old convict buildings.Weather in this part of Tasmania can change at a moments notice, so do be prepared for sun, rain, hot, cold and everything in between."
Wonderful！,"It's a beautiful place!I think,you mast go there,it's better."
A quiet and interesting island to explore.,"We travelled over on the east coast cruises boat which was the least expensive of the two boats that go there. It took about 30 minutes. There are large trolleys to load the luggage on. We had fun pulling it to the campsite. The campsite is situated behind a nice beach and has a shelter shed with barbeques (free) and enough bushes for shade. It has hot solar heated showers and water. (there are bunkhouses too - at a higher cost - and hard to get a vacancy as they are booked out way ahead)There is lots of wildlife. Cape Barren Geese everywhere, Butterflys and dragonflys galore. Wallabys of course.  We went wombat spotting at dusk and saw 6 around the campsite in about 10 minutes. A blue tongue lizard lived around our campsite and slept under my tent. We saw a big tiger snake when walking. Great snorkelling but the water was so cold we couldnt stay in long. We lay on the pier and looked through the cracks to view the bright colored  Jewel Anemones clinging to the supports. There are good tracks to different parts of the island. Many used bikes to get around. We walked (6) hours return to Chinamans bay. past some nice beaches, and swam at a few. The old ruins from convict prison days are interesting to look through too. We stayed 3 nights but really needed more time to do the island justice. It's quiet with no cars except the rangers. There were a lot of people at the camp ground as it was a holiday weekend. However we didn't see many during the day as everyone was off somewhere.Taking a bicycle is a good idea. You would get around quicker. They do hire them over there for $20. We will definely go back one day to do more walks."
Maria Island Walk 4 day tour,Just a brilliant trip. Relatively easy walking with harder options available; enthusiasistic and knowledgeable guides; great huts and super food and drink....
Magical Maria Island Walk,"We recently completed the 4 day guided Maria Island Walk with some interstate and overseas friends.  It is said you never really appreciate what you have in your own back yard!!  As a Tasmanian I was completely blown away by not only the natural beauty and tranquility of Maria Island, but also by the quality and standard of The Maria Island Walk Company.  It really is a world class operation.  The wilderness camps are enchanting, the food and wine is amazing and the guides are first class.  There are only 8 walkers with the 2 guides in the group; the walking is not too hard; the challenging climbs are optional; and you only have to carry around 8kg in your pack.  A relaxed and friendly 4 day adventure I would recommend to anyone.  I was proud to share this unique experience with our visiting friends."
Scenic and Serene -go for a day or stay longer to refresh the soul.,"Maria Island National Park in Tasmania is a must see for Wildlife lovers. This is the island that has the Painted Cliffs of sandstone that are featured on many calenders and postcards of Tasmania. They are within an easy walk from the ferry, as are the Fosiil Cliffs although the walk is a little more uphill in places. The ferry across from Triabunna is a great way to spot dolphins and sea eagles and at certain times you may see  whales when they are migrating. The island is all National Park so no shops or cars but there are convict built buildings to inspect and facilities to stay the night in a convict dorm with bunk beds. One needs to take everything across including pillows and bedding, food water and candles etc.We stayed for 5 days and explored the island seeing wombats every afternoon, Cape Barren Geese, pademelons, kangaroos and possums. It is a photographer's and artist's dream.If you want to get away from it all and have a peaceful day away from the hustle of the city then Maria Island will be exactly right. If you are energetic you can take your bike across on the ferrry, or climb Lewis and Clerk Mt to get the best view from the peak across to the mainland and spot whales from there. If you book ahead you can stay longer than a day and really explore as we did. A memorable holiday that stands out as the best time we had away in 2011.Remember to take only photos and memories and leave only footprints so others can enjoy the pristine beauty of the island for years to come."
Beautiful Maria Island - With Expert Guides,"From the moment we  booked the trip,  to the end of the trip every member of the Maria Island Walk team were very friendly and professional.  The trip exceeded my expectations not only from the fab facilities, great guides, and excellent food to the unbelievable beauty and tranquility of the Island.  We were very lucky that we had sunshine and warmth every day and nights were not too cold (I was a little nervous about this as we had so few pieces of clothing) but it was fine (and they had heaters in the mess tents and sleeping bags were great.  Our guides were fantastic and the perfect hosts and really made the trip!"
Unique experience,"Went to Maria Island for a day tour. Checked out the fossil cliffs and walked towards the Bishop and Clerk. It`s a pretty tough walk. As my wife was with me, we took a little more time that I planed. Guess it took us around 5 hours from the time we left the comissaire`s house to the time we returned there. As the boat departs back at 5pm, we hadn`t time to walk for the Painted Cliffs.The island is a very unique and interesting place, full of kangaroos and gooses. The fossil cliffs are gorgeous. Must be even more beautiful with sun - we faced a cloudy day."
"Book in advance - it leaves only once a day at 9 am. Bring all your water, food and your National Park pass","You book at the Visitor's information center.  They were friendly but tried to rip you off.  You need a National Park Pass and need to buy it at the info center.  Buy the person pass not the vehicle one which is what they sold me.  There are no vehicles allowed on the island so was overcharged the $12 AUD - which they did correct after I explained it to them.  Also they charged me $2 for a local call - as I was in a rush and had no cell phone coverage I paid it but the public telephone a block down cost $0.50.Lots of hiking, widelife to see.  You can stop in the old town building to sit and eat while escaping the sun.  The rangers on the island were very friendly and helpful."
The Maria Island Walk,"We did the Maria Island Walk in February this year. The island, a national park, is a short boat ride from the Tasmanian mainland south of Frecinet.The four day experience, under the care of two knowledgable, kind, enthusiastic, fit guides was a delight.The island is beautiful, with rare and endangered bird and animal species and spectacular seashores and also offers well preserved sites and relics of significant historical interest.At the end of a day of gentle rambling or strenuous hiking - the choice was ours - we enjoyed dinner and fine wines by candlelight.At night we were snug in our sleeping bags, with silk lining,  on comfortable beds in our semi permanent camp huts.This guided walk is highly recommended!"
Maria Island Walk - wonderful,"We just completed the 4 day Maria Island Walk in the company of great friends and had the opportunity of walking with a new wonderful couple. The group thoroughly enjoyed the sights, walks, camps, and especially the multi-talented guides who not only guide, advise on flora and fauna but are first rate chefs and sommeliers. The food and wine (always wonderful in Tasmania) was fantastic. Our guiding couple knew the area and nothing was too much trouble as they showed us the wonders of this beautiful part of the world. Our ascent of Mt. Maria was made easier by Mette's care and advice. A fantastic holiday, yes, roughing it and camping but 5 star. Swimming the in crystal clear surf at the end of a day's walk was superb. The last night in Bernacchi's home and the dinner was incredible. Well worth the trip to Tasmania and undertaking the scenic and refreshing walk."
The Maria Island Walk....just perfect!,"I recently completed the 4 day Maria Island Walk and had the most fabulous experience.  I joined the group as a single traveller and felt immediately welcomed by the Guides and included in the group.  The whole 4 days was just perfect, from coordination, food, accommodation, Guide knowledge and capability to encourage and motivate the group. The design of the walk caters for different fitness levels, which assisted in all of us feeling self satisfied in what we achieved over the 4 days.  The Guides were also very accommodating to ensure this was achieved.The food was fresh and delicious, and often Tasmanian.  The wine was also a real treat at the end of each day!I had fabulous time and would happily recommend this trip!!  If only the Maria Island Team had another trip I could go on!"
Maria Island for a Day,"I spent a day on Maria Island last week. It was a fabulous way to spend the day. Maria (pronounced ""mah-RYE-ah"") really deserves a week as others here describe, but I was on an extended cycling trip and didn't have the time. I was not on a tour but booked myself onto the ferry service that runs once daily from Triabunna. It leaves Triabunna at 9 am and returns at 5 pm. I brought my touring bicycle with me but be warned that only mountain bikes should be brought as the paths are bumpy and rocky.  I saw only a fraction of the island but truly enjoyed what I did see. The highlight for me was Fossil Cliffs. The view of the ocean is astounding as is being surrounded by all of these prehistoric shells perfectly preserved in rock. I was the only person there. The beaches are astounding. Beautiful, pristine, quiet. Those that overnighted on Maria talked about seeing and hearing many different animals that come out at dusk. Maria is a pristine area without stores, electricity, motorized vehicles, restaurants, and most important: NO WATER. You'll have to bring your own drinking water and food with you."
