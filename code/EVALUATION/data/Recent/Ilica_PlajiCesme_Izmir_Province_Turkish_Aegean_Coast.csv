Most popular Turkey Aegean beach,"Ilica beach is a terrific long beach on the northern part of Cesme peninsula. It's very popular with locals so it might get crowded.Fine white sand stretches for miles with both free and private parts belonging to hotels. Water's warm and really pleasant to swim in. Many water sports with reasonable prices. In side streets are several shops, eateries and restaurants."
Nice ,A bit windy as it was the start of autumn. Due to pandemia local administration divided the beach for social distancing. Very cleverly done. Nothing fancy just sea and sand. And walking distance to food. Enjoyed it much
best puplic beach on çeşme,the views was amazing and there is a good service there WC and shower and some cafe mini bus available from there to çeşme and alaçati
Ilica beach,One of Cesme's finest beaches.  The water here is a little warmer than Altinkum but the waves can be quite high at times. Parking can be a bit of an issue at weekends but fine in the side and back streets nearby during the other days.
Sometimes the natural untouched public beach is best!,There is no where to hire chairs despite what I read on TA.There are markers on the beach for social distancing. Wasnt very busy anyway so we had enough space
Cool Beach,Truly beautiful beach with torqoise sea colors. It is too busy in high season but still clean and clear.
A decent stretch of beach with longers available.,This is just past the small dock are and small food places by the sea. Loungers are available but there is a cost of around 10 lira a time. A pleasant enough area which is a good stretch so space can always be found. No real loud music playing to disturb you if looking to relax properly.The sea is very shallow here so it is possible to walk out at least 50 metres and still not be submerged. Some pebbles making for an awkward entrance but there are sandy areas to wade in.
Good enough for public beach,"Parking could be a problem, sea is good but it was very crowded and we did not feel safe. İt is very long and sand could be more clean"
A nice day at the beach,"Ilica is rather long, so yo can pick which section to lie on. There are chaise longues and parasols at decent prices and numerous terraces where you can grab a beer, coffee or whatever you want. It seems to be a favourite of Russian tourists. Getting into the water requires beach shoes, or very insensitive soles..."
clean and friendly,"it was a clean plaj.the weather and bangalow was so nice.food and beverage were lovely.i wish i could prepare my wedding ceremony at there:)))light wind,blue sky,beautiful sea made us a good memorization.shuttle service was ontime too."
Very good and busy,"This beach is shallow with warm water, my kids and I loved it, it's a bit rocky in places still very good, Best going there in your swimming clothes with outerwear on top, I could not find any changing facility even if there is, but just a day before I saw lots of ppl going to Ilica beach already changed in their swim clothes with long dress like covers so did the same and saved the hassle."
great beach,"Really busy Beach , however we had an amazing day  had an amazing day  beach chairs a little expensive at 40 lira a person .food was good not great  however value for money ."
"Sandy Beach, Rough Waves","The sand area is quite wide and long. The sand is fine. However, the sea is wave most of the year. The water is shallow for about 100 meters form the shore line."
Beautiful beach,Beautiful beach with white-ish sands. Yet Ilica is almost always windy and the water is a bit rough.
Not recommended,"I never go back. I recommend you to go to other nice beaches on southern part of Alacati, probably the beach clubs which are more secluded, less crowded and cleaner.In Illica Plaji, you do not see much of the white sand that reviews and websites talk about. The whole beach is about 1.5 km in a U-shape format; very restricted and not cosy. On the northern part of the beach (close to Sheraton private beach) there is a sandy beach with depth of less than 25 meters, restricted by restaurants, creating a soffocating feeling. On the other side of the bay where private boats were parked, there was a concrete beach connected to the sea by ladders. Here, there were a few small logons of sand beach (10 by 5 meter!) to give you the ridiculous feeling of resting on sand! The beach was very crowded on every corner, not very clean, ppl were swarming, everyone was smoking cigar and I did not breathe fresh air even for a minute. Many places rented sunshades for 10 to 15 Lira. Especially if you are traveling from Izmir and plan to spend one day at one of Cesme beaches, do not waste your day here!"
Beatiful,"Ilıca has three wonderful beaches on this 4 mile stretch of ""the world's finest, whitest sand along the Gulf of İzmir each one of beaches offers a slightly different beach experience, but they all share the same azure gulf waters, picture-perfect sunsets, and soothing breeze that melts away your troubles so you really can't go wrong with any of them."
Very nice beach,It is a beach with white sands and green water really nice and clean you can hire an umbrella  with 15 lira the beach could be better if they but sun seats there are shower rooms and wcs but must be more restaurant on the beach will be good
beautiful beach,The beach is beautiful and long and on a sunny day many people go there to swim and sunbathe.The only drawback was the lack of a dressing room and a shower.
Ilica beach,Gorgeous beach to walk on for your daily exercise in the morning before it gets busy. You can dip in the sea if it gets hot. Very safe.
Clean and Dirty,"The water was warm and clear with moderate waves, the beach itself was dirty with cigarette butts and bits of litter. Beach bed hire was reasonably priced, with a lot of the coverings tatty, verging on dirty. Plenty of beach restaurants, vendors and shops to choose from for food."
Dirty,I was surprised by how dirty the beach was. The whole thing is covered in loungers and umbrellas which you have to pay for. I would have assumed the owners of these businesses would have worked to keep the beach tidy and clean to get people to want to come back but it appeared to just be covered in little bits of litter and not really the beach experience I was looking for. Snorkelled a bit but there was next to nothing to see. Would recommend snorkelling further down the coast.
Terribly contaminated with sewage.,"Avoid swimming not only on this beach, but on any beach on the coast of Izmir. Because of inadequate capacities, all sewage treatment plants in izmir discharge raw sewage into the sea, mostly during crowded summer months."
Advice,"In Ilica the beach consists of two parts. First one which is free of charge, but not any bed and umbrella, It's better to go second one - to Sharaton hotel by paying 400 tl. There is a big pool and kids pool. Bed, umbrella, and towels included. There is a restaurant inside. Prices are a bit high but foods were delicious."
Too 🌊wavy,There was very Wave that is why you can't swim easily in there. there was windy weather. You should keep you stuff in your bag when you go to beach where it is free.
Best beach in cesma,Definitely recommend.. soft sand .. sunbeds available for rental .. clean water and beach (might be too crowded on weekends)’
Mrs. Grosso,Fantastic!  It was clean and it wasn’t crowded.  They had many places to tab and it was extremely comfortable!
A most place to visit,Easily get rid of all negative thoughts as you immerse in the tranquility of this untouched sea.Highly recommended
Beautiful Sandy beach,"This is the famous sandy beach of Ilica, Cesme. If you go weekends or a holiday times,it would be very crowded.The only problem might be the organisation of the sunbeds and sun-umbrellas, there might be different prices which you mat not find adequate.Please find out from your friends or hotel how it works."
The best Sandy bed beach in Turkey!,I love the Aegean side of Turkey and I have travelled to many places in Turkey which are stunning but Ilica is an amazing public beach and it has a beautiful clear sandy bed. Ideal for families.
Like a miami beach,If one day you decided to visit Çeşme than you should see Ilıca Beach. I recommend you that  just passed away by car a long the road nearby Ilıca Beach. For swimming and sun tanning there are better places.
Terribly Dirty,Private beach concept doesn’t work in Ilica Beach. Seasonal business in vacation places are always same they want to rip you all the way off 👎 👎 👎  They want to make millions in a very short period of time so we are the victims for this scenario for sure. These private beaches are extremely dirty and unhygienic places in every single sense.
Lovely beach near Cesme,I took the minibus to here from Cesme main street. Lovely clean beach. You can get back on same minibus and go to Alacati about 5 mins away.
"Fine, white sand beach","A public beach with beautiful, fine white sand, crystal clear sea and shallow for many metres enabling one to see many small fish. Even in early October there were people sunbathing and swimming.  Assortment of beach cafes on the beach itself and along the promenade."
Huge beach,"Still lovely weather,  25c in October but the beach is deserted and it's a huge sandy beach with a very gradual slope into the sea which looks safe for kids.  Clean where the hotels and beach cafe and sunbeds are. Seems to be plenty of restaurants near the promenade."
Beautiful sandy beach,"Many beaches around here have pebbles but this beach is sandy. When we visited in late September, we had the beach largely to ourselves for the morning. Parking was easy. In the afternoon it was busier but still very empty. It is a large beach.The beach has restaurants but is far less commercial than those further south with no sunbeds/beach umbrellas when we were there. Nice if you prefer a less crowded beach (unlike those on the south coast of Turkey)."
Ilıca beach,"One of the best beaches of Çeşme.There are 8 gates to the beach.The variations of blue and green colours of water is fantastic.Çeşme is a source of thermal water too.Therefore you can feel hot water coming from the bottom of sea.The sand on the beach is white and thin.Usually windy.It is a good place to make a windsurf too.It is a beautiful place.But all visitors, please don't leave your trashes,cigarettes behind you.Keep the beach and sea clean.No glass bottles on the beach please..."
"Great, white sand, clean","It is great beach, white sand, hot water,no rock or oyster might hurt your feet at the bottom of water.Not getting deep quickly."
Pristine Waters,"We first came to this beach as it was the closest to Alacati, where we were staying, and liked it so much that we didn't bother checking out any other beaches. The beach is sandy, as well as the sea-bed, and the water is beautifully clean and crystal clear at just the right temperature. There is a beach bar with lovely staff that serves hot snacks and an array of drinks at very decent prices. I must add that every single item I tried over a period of two weeks was absolutely delicious. Don't let the understated appearance of Ilica beach put you off as it is a charming little place to relax at a fraction of the hefty entrance fees charged at hotel beach clubs. Well worth a visit."
Sandy Beachfront ,"What a beautiful sandy beach. Sand so thin and nice. Water is so clean and nice to swim. My girlfriend loved this beach, we will come back next year. And definitely come to September not really crowded.5 * beach."
"Good beach, Good service","We wanted to spend the day on the beach near alacati, the reviews for the beach clubs was dismal so we drove a few kilometres to ilaca.  At the far end of the beach was a cafe with a small beach with free loungers and access to showers and toilets.  The beach was raked, no rubbish in view and the water safe and clean.  The snacks in the cafe were resonantly priced and could be brought to the beach or eaten on the promenade.The cafe was called Sevki....staff were helpful and spoke some English."
Cesme,Cesme it's  little city but seaside is wonderful.Clean sand and blue sea.If You are not staying in the hotel it is not well organised and the knowledge of Turkish needed.Anyway hospital people will help You.Take time to visit the castle close to the harbour.
No Blue Flag award here,"From what we could tell staying at the western end of ilica beach there was not much access to a public beach. The nearest we could find was immediately west of the Sheraton hotel. This proved shallow and dirty. Guess they couldn't do much about the depth of beach short of pushing the road back but they could certainly clear away the mounds of rubbish piled up at the side of the steps down to it. Discarded fag butts abounded. Sunbeds cost TL 50 per pair.  We bought drinks from nearby shop. On the positive side, the water was splendidly warm. Perhaps from thermal undersea discharges...yet to look that up but the temperature was definitely warmer than that further south at Alacati Port. Not sure why Ilica beach seems to get so highly rated considering its less than appetizing presentation but maybe reviews are from the users of private beaches linked to their corresponding hotels which are better looked after."
Super beautiful beach. ,One of the most beautiful beach in the world. Very suitable for the families with little kids. There are too many shops nearby. You can rent long chair and sun umbrella
Small beach but nice sea,Small beach butt nice water. You need to rent Sun beds. A lot of locals from Izmir. Lota of good restaurants. I did rent a water scooter. Witch was pretty expensive.
very nice sandy beach,"The beach is very nice, 30 minutes walk from Lacati and 10 minutes by bus (car); entrance is 25 TL and you get an umbrella and a chair"
Public beach,"The entrance fee was 25 TL which included a bed and an umbrella, and they charged 3 TL for the shower. This beach was sandy and quite crowded."
Dırty,"Area around ılıca plajı looks lıke some very rıch area but as soon as you step on the beach ıt become a gheto area! Beach ıs full of rubbısh and people are all over each other ! Hygene of thıs place ıs very low ! Water by ıt self ıs really preety, ıt ıs colour ın blue and a bıt wawy !"
Nice beach ,Nice clean beach but needs to have bins as there were to many rubbish left behind but nice sand and great for kids
Beautiful beach,"Ilica beach is long, sandy beach, water is warm, clean. On the beach you can rent sunbeds and parasols. Ideal for families with small children."
Clean and beautiful beach ,"Beautiful and sandy beach, not so expensive, we paid as couple 50 TL for sunbeds, food and drinks good and cheap."
Cozy,"Nice and small beach, inwhich there are local people mostly.Renting a bed and an umbrella costs between 20 to 50 tl.I couldnt find a good bar there, there were just some small super market.Toilets were awful"
Beautiful public beach,Very beautiful beach which is suitable to go with kids.Water may be a little cool at times and the place is windy which makes it even more attractive as you do not feel hot.You may think of using the beach clubs too since facilities on the beach like toilette and shower is not available outside the beach club.For a more comfortable experience you can use the beach in front of Sheraton hotel for which you need to pay.Decent Crowd all the time.
just beautiful,"we spent a whole day here on the beach. clear waters, white sand, and amazing views. we flew from Istanbul to Izmir, took the bus to Cesme, and had the most beautiful over day. Recommended."
ilica beach,One of the best beaches that i have ever seen. Worm water makes you feel like in a warm pool. You can walk 250 meters and the sea is still at your knees. Makes you feel like in a pool.  Very clean and bright
Biggest beach in Cesme,This is a nice beach open to everyone. You dont need to pay to swim here instead of other famous beaches in Cesme. Try not to go there in weekend.
Excellent beach with crystal clear waters,"Went for a swim with my 3 year old son who thoroughly enjoyed the shallow extra clear water.The west end of the beach towards the Sheraton hotel or Cesme has a few restaurants and shops.If you are driving to the beach, parking on the waterfront is scarce so you will probably need to park on a back road and walk down. There are no showering facilities on the beach but it is really clean."
Very Clean Water,"Although it is a public beach, I was blown away by its cleanliness. However, the beach staff in the paid area was quite awful as usual."
beautiful beach,We visited with my 4 yr old late september and it was lovely. It wasnt very busy which was great. We visited this beach 3 times because my daughter enjoyed it that much. Lots of restaurants and nice ppaces to eat.
Lovely beach.,"Lovely clean beach, clear water and shallow until about 200 metres out from the beach.Prices for sun beds and umbrella about £5 to £6 a day."
Comfortable ,This beach is the most famous one among all the beaches of Cesme and Alacati. We had a short visit here while going to Cesme. Everything was OK.
"Stunning beach for swimming, relaxing and views","I know I wanted to  read lots of reviews to findout which beaches were best for swimming so Im happy to share details to make it easy for TA membersthis beach is a great choice - Soft sand, beautiful views, warm water, gentle waves and lovely place to relaxgood for babies"
Missing old Ilica,"Refugees are everywhere, unfortunately the public beach turn out to be their living area.Expect more from local management to find proper relocation for them and save Ilica plaji as it was extremely dirty."
Nice beach ,"Crystal clear water, a little bit salty, fine sand, very clear beach, lounges are pricey but worthy, very windy when I was there"
Beautiful beach,Live close by and highly recommend this sandy beach on any day but a Sunday or Bayram when it fills up with domestic tourists. The winds can pick up so be aware!
The best beach in the area,"Large sandy beach, with sun loungers for hire.  If you get hungry, check out Dost Pide for some great food."
Ilica Plaji ( Ilıca beach),"Ilıca beach has a warm and clean water, fine sand for all age groups to enjoy  swimming and sunbathing. Sea water has a more than  a mile knee level depth makes it attractive for all to have a fun. Proximity to cafes, bar and eateries and easily accessible by dolmus ( mini bus )."
Long wide shallow beach ,"This sandy, long and wide beach looks beautiful and is the favorite of many people. If you have small children, if you like shallow sea,  it is the perfect beach for you. However if you like deep sea or if you don't like the wind, you may have to think twice. There are private beaches with beach chairs and umbrellas ( like the Sheraton ) and also a public beach with no facilities. There's also a beach for the handicapped.Check the Music before you decide."
Not clean enough for my taste,"Too many people, not clean enough. While we were lying on the beach a razorblade washed up ashore...!"
So hot in June,Nice public beach. Very crowded on a hot June afternoon. I decided to check it out last minute and didn't have my sandals on me. Almost burned my feet with the sand so hot. The walk along the shore was peaceful.
Calm waters ,"This is a beach open to public, it's also very clean. Easily reachable via public transport which is ideal for travellers."
Sand is perfect,"It is a large and sandy beach at Ilica. Cheaper than other beach clubs at Cesme and Alacati. It may be a little bit hotter at mid summer because of not enough shelter around. You can find cheap shower, simple food and beverages at around. Since it is not getting deep for meters, good for playing, not for swimming."
The Best Beach in Çeşme,It's a public beach but the water and the sand is the best one in çeşme area. It's center of Ilıca and near by all restaurants & shops.
Always wonderful,"This beach is best in Cesme, sunny spring days, even there were several people swimming or some others just came for sunbath."
One of the greatest,We came in April so we didn't try to swim however view was great. Like Caribbean. White sands and crystal clear sea. Worth to visit. You will like
Turquoise Colored Sea,"Very thin sand streches a long way, sandy inside the sea, clear water with one of the best tone of  turquosie. Spend the whole day on golden sand and refresh in cool sea. Crowded in summer,best in September."
Turquoise Waters,The beach has fine sand and the most turquoise water you can probably find in the mediterranean. It is a public beach but you can also rent seats and buy drinks and food.
The best beach ,"It is a little town with the best beach. The sun, sand and crystal clear water. Oh yeah if you love those three it is exactly the right spot. The beach beds need to be rented for you to use. The cafe offers  nice food which is pretty much  only couple of liras more expensive than normal prices however they serve you everything when you are sun baking."
WATCH OUT FOR SHARKS,One end of the beach past the Sheraton is less stoney than the other end. The sea is warm and slopes very gently out to sea. Fantastic sandy beach only spoilt by the sharks known as sunbed hirers. Unless yiu are turkish expect to pay well over the odds to hire sunbeds and parasols. I understand that this a known problem and the authorities are looking to clamp down on these rogues and ensure consistent and reasonable pricing. Good luck to them
Mohamed,Wonderful beach with super clear water but i think more facilities are needed like cloth changing cabins and showers but overall i liked the place
Swimmers:prefer morning. Free use possible,"The sea is a bit cool but excellent until say 12:00 also not crowded at all (at least at this time). Entrance is free but you need to pay for beach facilities, seats and umbrellas. If you have your own umbrella and seats or dont mind sitting on the sand then you don't need to pay for anything. The choices for food and drinks in beach  cafes are poor but the beach is very close to city where you can use supermarkets or eat in better restaurants.Nice for a swim in the morning and better for walks in the afternoon when it gets windy."
Very nice,"The beach is great, the sea is a little cold, but very translucent.  We stayed at the Sheraton beach bar, with has a nice deck that goes in the sea. You don't have to pay for the entrance, only what you consume. Very nice place, very crowded at the beginning."
Overly crowded ,It's a challenge to swim here because the waves are big and rough. Not suitable for small children also has some trash in the water.
Wasn't impressed,This beach was very overcrowded and as you walked along to get a sun bed the prices rose considerably up to 50 lira each and you had to pay for children .... The facilities were dirty and poor .. The beach was also very littered .... The only good thing was the sea was warm Not sure why the previous reviews were so good maybe it was the start of the season.... I would not go back
"Long, white sand",Impressive! It's a bit windy most of the time. But watching waves on the white long sand and getting into the warm water makes you think that 'glad I'm here' :-)  Perfect sunset view! Great location!
Over crowded with terrible people. ,Public beach with pack with un hygiene people. 50 turkish lira for two person. To many people top of each other.  Only two dirty toilet for thousands of people to get in  to  the toilet or use changing room you need to wait over 45min. And 2tl you need to pay.
Nice place to walk for sightseeing.,We walked here from our hotel to have Kumru at Sevki and some tea. The beach and houses make a nice panoramic view. The beach is clean. It is a good place to read your book or newspaper.
Crystal clear,Water was very clean and crystal clear. It was warm and perfect for a swim. Reccomend going there theres also restaurants around for drinks food or lunch.
Amazing morning swim,"Parking your car might be a bit difficult if you are not willing to pay for it. We went to ilica beach before breakfast and it was nearly deserted . Warm water, no wind, no big waves - amazing!"
Cesme,"Ilica beach, if you go around July most of the beaches are windy. Water and the view it's absolutely beautiful.when î go end of the May or September where the water is flat not dirty because of the wind brings all the seaweed and some garbage on the shore. There is lots of beautiful clubs and Beach clubs,but not in Ilica.You have to go Alacati or Ayayorgi. Never windy it's little expensive but some of the beach clubs Beach during the day club and restaurant at nights. View absolutely breathtaking."
Not suitable for little kids,"Too rocky and pebbly on and around the beach. You need to go deeper into the water to avoid the rocks, therefore not suitable for kids."
Beautiful View but too windy,Very nice beach with a breathtaking view but too windy.  Renting the chairs and the umbrella is affordable. Can get a little crowded.
Overloaded ,"Overloaded overloaded overloaded...  I understand why there is not a lot of bad comments, you request at least 100 chars :-)"
To crowdy and touristy,"Cramped in too many sun beds at a small space. This is not for me. Most of the other turists do not take into account that it is cramped and you get kickt and they shake their towel on you, kids screaming."
OK to walk along,"My wife and I spent time at Ilica beach a few days ago. It's nice to walk from one side to another, and it's one of the nicest beaches in the region of Cesme that hasn't been too developed with beach clubs. That said, Cesme lacks the amenities of some others. There are thousands of OK lounge chairs for recent, and a handful of local beach hut restaurants - so the basics are here, but it's nothing fancy. This area is also more windy than some other beaches in the area"
"Dirty beach, shallow water. I saw better beaches in Turkey.","The only positive thing about this beach is that its very close to Izmir. 1 hour with minibus. Maybe shallow water is geat for kids,but for grown ups you have to walk endlessly  to a deeper place to actually enjoy swimming. Water is not very transparent, totally nothing to look at if you like diving. The beach is called public but its full of private  sunbeds which are too expensive. As I inderstood, toilets and changing rooms are private too which means you cannot use them unless you booked sunbeds. I have not seen any rubbish bins, packs of cigarettes and bottles are just there on the sand.  Some beach workers and visitors feel free to leave their rubbish just  like that."
Must visit,Crystal clear waters and a long stretch of clean golden sand. This is the best beach in Cesme and it's free entry. You can rent a sun lounger incl. table and umbrella for just 15 lira. Carribean eat your heart out
Good for your health,"Ilıca is a very famoıs beach in Çeşme. They say there is 40 different mineralöin water. It is a sandy beach and not deep. Ideal for children but can be waves when there is wind. It is a long beach and ideal for older people,children and families."
Pre-Season,"There were very few people walking the beach when we were. If there are spots of heated water, which was what we'd hoped to find, we didn't find them. If they were off shore you'd freeze getting back to shore and dry. There are huge and super expensive hotels and homes and it is obvious this is The place in the summer months. We enjoyed the solitude. Turkey does not respect their resources as there is garbage blown up to the shore and there it stays, a shame."
Amazing water,"We were with family in this beach. It was in June. So, in this time first we were in Bodrum. After in Ilica. I want to tell that in Bodrum was cold water. But! In Ilica it was amazing! Because the thermal water comes to sea water. Also we seen an oysters, not deep in the water.Want to come back!"
Nice beach ,Crystal clear water and nice view but u must call a taxi to go back to alaçati if u live ther the cafes the is not too many but they r good
Perfect...,This beach is very long. Its white sand and wonderful sea. The area of the beach is very high quality. Its the best beach of Cesme.
Very nice beach,A long beach with plenty of things to do. Mostly sunny. People playing voleybol. Sea is wavy but not so deep.
Wonderful beach,Beach sands are like gold. Perfect sea and sands. Beach is always crowded in the summer time. You have to be early to find place. The temperature of the sea was hot. Good for swim.
Perfect,"I like the beach, it is so nice, the weather, the service, the cafes. It is one of the best beaches in turkey. If you go to cesme dont miss this area."
Nice beach!!!,“Fantastic”Love this beach with hot water and mostly nice waves especially  kucuk play were the service is so great... Love cesme as well
Lovely beach,"Beautiful beach, ideal for children. Best time to travel June, July, August. Nice restaurants and hotels near by."
We loved walking on the empty beach in winter.,The wind gets up and it is brisk and envigorating in winter . None of the summer tourists to worry about and an excellent fish auction to watch!
Nice sunset,"Although the beach itself is nothing special (since I was out of season), the water is clean, the sunset excellent."
Crystal Clear Water,"The water is warm, salty, which means you can swim without much effort, and crystal clear. Both the water and the beach are clean and well maintained. It's a bit difficult to get into the sea from the shore because the large rocks there are slippery; however, that problem can be easily overcome by using the stairs. The beach also offers privacy and is not overcrowded. A great experience."
Long beach,Fine sand and two kilometers long. Plenty of room and the sea temperature is never too cold even in October.
great swimming beach with fabulous views,Fabulous beach with breaktaking views! Really enjoyed the early morning swim - not crowded except for a few joggers. The water was clear and crisp... the only issue I had were the street dogs... the council could do some work to remove them off the beach...
Love You Ilıca Beach,"Ilıca beach is my favorite place when I go on holiday. This place is my son's favorite beach too.  I admire the lovely blue, lovely sands... I suggest this place all of you. Love <3"
"Ilaca, dance with the vawes..","The most beautiful beach in this area. Walk on the sands, dance with vawes and enjoy your stay in Cesme.."
My favorite beach in Cesme,"Lovely beach , free Publi area, white sand in a length of 2 km and crystal clear and very Warm water"
Great for swimming,"Wonderful beach,shallow warm, thermal water makes this a great beach for all ages. Lots of traders selling food like sweet corn, breads, toffee apples nuts etc"
Excelent beach and great water,"The beach is white and sandy, there are crowded portions and not so crowded. On the weekend it is very crowded. You can rent umbrellas and sun beds. Unfortunately toilets are quite far apart so one has to walk some. The water is great, it has some thermal springs, so it is always the warmest water in turkey as I read. You can walk for a long time until it gets deeper so it is excellent for children. Prices for the umbrella and chairs are expensive."
Calm clear waters and soft sand,"Great long beach with lovely clean waters for swimming. This is a busy beach, although still maintains a feeling of paradise with a lovely bay and setting. There are watersports options on the beach although these are confined to one area. The Sheraton hotel is situated on a stretch of the beach in the middle, so you must go on either side if not a guest here. However, you are able to pass through. Not too many restaurants/ bars situated on the beach although these are on the parallel road.The run-off water from the shower facilities goes directly into the sea in one area and so avoid this small patch!!"
Disappointing,"We'd heard wonderful reviews of this beach and honestly questioned if we were in the right place when we arrived.Judging only the beach, the water and the view of the surrounding hills, we could see this as a world class beach. Unfortunately the reality includes humans -their trash and their greed. Every inch of the beach is lined with dirty plastic lounge chairs, (renting from €1 to €25) and the sand was littered with cigarette butts and debris. As we sat on our stained lounges under a torn umbrella, a group of young men sat in the water smoking cigars and drinking beer. Not going back..."
Very nice place to come to beach.,We stayed at a hotel on ilica beach. Beautiful water and views. It is rocky in certain areas and afternoons are windy.  Water was very cold. Rubber water shoes are recommended due to rocks.
Waste of tıme,A very narrow beach filled with rows of plastic sun beds that reach the actual waters lapping the shore. The few places to eat and drink were as expensive as Istanbul and petrol and lpg are the moost expensive along the coast.
The most beautiful beach,"When I went to the Ilica beach, it was like i went to paradise. The warm sand was shining in a white colour and as I walked over it was just soft and awesome. The water was crystal clear and the colour of the water was turquoise. I thought why go to Caribbean, it's the same here. Such an amazing place! I will definitely come again, that's for sure!"
Great beach for kids,"We came with our kids, ages 5 and 8, and met our friends with their 10 year old and had a blast. Beautiful warm aqua water is very shallow and perfect for kids. Great sand for digging and making sand castles. As a Rhode Island native who grew up with the ocean, I loved the waves here. Food service is available to order from your lounge chair in addition to plently of beachside snacks like sut mısır, midye dolma and elma şekeri."
Very small and crowded,Not worth it. Very small and crowded. Not for me. You can't find parking space easy. I guess it is for sun bathing and not for swimming .
Nice public beach!,"Long, sand beach. Great sea, like anywhere in Çeşme area. You can rent sunbeds and umbrellas if you want to. One of the very few public beaches of the area. Many facilities nearby to have food and drinks."
Day at the beach,Very warm and shallow water. Great for families with small kids. Easy to find a spot for yourself. Lots of cafes to get drinks and snack. Can be very busy.
Nice family beach.,"Lovely sandy beach and beautiful clear water, brilliant for children because it is shallow for at least 50 meters. Get there early as it gets crowded."
Nice beach,Nice public beach. Clean and warm see. Easy access from cesme by dolmus. Might be crowded at weekends. You need to pay for lounges in most of the places.
"Hot Sand, Warm Sea","Despite arriving at almost midday, the beach was still relatively uncrowded, especially towards the eastern end. Sun loungers with umbrellas were available to rent at reasonable prices (40tl); showers, toilets and changing facilities were all present and in good condition. The sea is one of the warmest I've experienced north of the Tropic of Cancer, one could easily spend a whole day swimming!A must-visit for anyone in the area."
"Poor beach services, dirty shore and streets ","I stayed at Ilica City Center for one month, i rented a monthly house, we are a Turkish family, with one 6 year old and one 7 months old. We preferred this area since we were told the sea is shallow and clear and warm , suitable for kids. Also the area known for its breezes so we assumed it will not be so hot like the southern part of Turkey.Ilica Beach unfortunately haven't met our expectations at allOn the positive side the sea is shallow for kids, and naturally have a warm thermal water coming from the grounds of the sea so it is warm , the kids can spend hours ... Mostly the sea is wavy and my son will enjoy jumping over the waves . In the morning hours especially the sea water is so clear and green , also have a great sunset.The area had strong winds until July 15th, so the tourist season for the town is almost like 1 or 1.5 months .. We were sorry to experience such garbage in the beach side , people keep on dumping garbage and it seems the city has no service in collecting , also the streets are dirty...Apart from that you get to pay 20 tl per-person ( 40 tl for 1 umbrella which includes 2 sun loungers), they make you pay even if you arrive at 17.00 pm or later , paying this you do not get anything , some dirty sun loungers , a poor shower , a dirty toilet ... Appearently those people who hire from citytown is just eager to collect money . Mostly they do not even bring your drink , it is self-service.We assumed as a family it is much wiser to go to private beaches around the city center by car... Almost the same price when you get some discount .The sea is sometimes wavy, sometimes clear but sometimes a dirt comes to the shore including some garbage or some green seaweed .Also at the beach as my son is building castles he came across many cigarettes, garbage and so on.Some parts there are longer sandy areas (6-7 meters) whereas some parts the shore is short (3-4 meters) ... We believe this area would be a tourist attraction if people actually has the intention to work instead of just try to make some money, i assume Ilica Beach is just for local tourists due to the lack of municipality services.The view is amazing , you get to see the islands , and the weather is windy compared to other parts of Turkey.The other beaches around are worthy visiting like Altinkum, Pasalimani  etc."
Public Beach - avoid at weekend,"This is the biggest public area at Cesme Peninsula with long sandy beach. Sea is shallow and good for small kids. Sand is gold colour, easy to play. It becomes very crowded at weekends, not good for those looking some trianqulity."
Clear water,"Public beach, sometimes there are vagues, but most of the time is calm. Warm water. You will stay hours in the sea. Avoid going on the weekend. During the week there is less people. Very long beach. Possibility to rent ""chaise-longues"". Don't bring valuable stuff. You are in a public beach. This is the same in all public beaches.Enjoy the sea."
Amazing beach at the Aegean coast of Turkey.,"One of the most amazing beaches in the world ever. Beautiful sand, plenty of space. and hot natural underwater springs that warm the cool waters of Cesme. More quiet during the week and can be busy at weekends as it is a publich beach. Renting of umbrella and beach beds is possible. Snack bars are present."
Lovely family beach,"A deservedly popular beach with a shallow and gently deepening water. There are hundreds of beach umbrellas to hire, which cost TL40. Difficult parking, so arrive early."
Crowded but worth a visit,"The beach was packed with sun loungers and sunbathers when we visited in July. There are only a couple of small patches where you can just lay a towel on the sand, otherwise you need to pay to use the loungers. It's not a quiet place at least during high season - but the water is warm and the sea breeze keeps things nice and comfortable."
Best beach ,This is the best beach by far....clear water and and white sand. Also the food service is very clean and prompt.
Great beach,"Great beach great water,Went there 3 times while on vacation In cesme, just wish the water would be cleaner , however what a beautiful beach"
Good Place to Swim,"Illica Beach is a lovely place to swim especially if you have children, there is soft sand and shallow clear water.  If you walk up the beach towards the boats and follow the water all the way along to the point, there is an enclosed thermal pool which all the locals use.  Where you can sit on a rock in warm water and talk to the locals, is is fairly shallow so would be ok for the kids.  We had a meal in one of the many beach front restaurants which was very good.  There is not much to the town, but we were not staying there and had caught one of the many buses there."
One of the best beaches in the world,"very clean and very nice sandy beach, easy to enter the water and it is not deep. Most of the time windy but that is a nice breeze in hot summer. Very crowded weekends"
very good sand beach,"very good sand beach, very long, sea is not deep, even it is  shallow. sun is not sets over sea but colors are ok. worth to see"
good local beach,Great beach from couple and families. Nice clean water and a no hassle beach. It was quiet when we were there.
Windy beach!,The sun fills the fine white sands of ılıca beach with light and fun. The beach is crowded but free. The sea is so clear. The sun chair is about 6€ each. Because of the wind it's good to be there during a hot summer.
Magnificent!!,"Excellent sea, very warm and fabolous wind .You can take a nap in beach and feel wind sound in your ear. Fighting with wave and feeling like a child..This is very different place than other beaches."
Calm place in preseason.,We went from our hotel 5 minutes to 'kücük ilica plaji'. You pay 15TL for renting a sunbed. Quiet expensive. I think there might be alternatives with just lying in the sand. But the coast is not much large. It was really calm. I can't say if the sunbeds are getting cleaned after one used it. The water was perfect. You have to walk quiet far into the water till you are able to swim. Really good for children too. Toilets are close. The service personel is nice.
Great shades of green and blue sea,"A great experience, at iilca beach wonderful soaking in the cool waters. Great location slightly cramped beach but still very good, lovely soft sand, the dodo restaurant and shack had some vegetarian pasta options.The emerald colour of the sea.The beds can be hired for 10-20 Lira's."
"Good choice for vacation at cesme , Turkey!!!","Very good hotel ,clean, amazing beach with a private Sea playland. Also very good and polite stuff !!!"
Amazing!,"If you're in turkey and loves beaches like i do, then ilica beach is the place to be. It's a sandy beach and the water here is crystal clear. The chairs can be rented for around 10-15 liras. Cafes and bars are nearby. You can easily come here from cesme city center by a dolmus."
Cesme,It's a long sandy beach. Sea is so clean that bottom can be seen from surface. But cafes and restaurants are a bit far distance to beach.
Beautiful Beach,"Beautiful Beach! Sandy and clean! Lot's of local restaurants and shops. Chairs are situated along the beach for rent about 5-15 Turkish Lira, or you can just sit on the sand if you don't want to rent chairs."
The color and the sand,"hang out, eat a kumru, have a few beers with chips, grab a few stuffed midye dolmas (stuffed mussels) from the wandering beach vendors, just enjoy the turquoise waters. Swim, walk, try to leave the real world behind. We visit this beach usually before schools go on holidays, so May or October is perfect timing."
soft sandy beach,"A little too cold for swimming as early May, even with thermal springs, but can imagine its lovely a little later in season."
"Beautiful Beach & Water, Great for Wading, Accessible from Izmir","Ilica has beautiful beaches with crystal blue waters.  It can be windy, which causes a fair amount of waves, and there was a bit of seaweed when we went, but it was avoidable and did not ruin or experience.  I thought the beach was very nice for kids because there is a large stretch of shallow water, allowing them to play safely despite the waves.We visited May 1, which is a Turkish holiday, but it was not very busy.  The water was a little chilly but not too cold to swim.  We went to a free public beach, but there appeared to be several others where you could pay to rent chairs and umbrellas.  We paid 2,50TL to use a shower/toilet facility and change.You can easily get to Ilica from Izmir by taking the Cesme Sayahat bus that runs from Fahretin Altay (near the metro & bus garage).  It is a large, comfortable tour bus that costs 13TL per seat per way and takes about an hour.I definitely recommend going to this beach if you are in the area."
Amazing blue waters,We were there on 1st of April 2015 and it was still too cold for a swim. Am not sure which side of the beach we were but  We were the only there. There were lots of hotels around but it's all closed  and we can see that repairs are ongoing probably in preparation for the summer season. The water was amazing was really compelled to take a dip if not for the cold weather. Really Wish I could return in summer next time...
"clean and warm water, chilling sand three gifts of amazing beach","the cleanest and most beautiful beach ı have ever seen in my life. when ı went to ılıca, ı relaxed for, sea seemed clear and  nice. ı have never see seaweed or jellyfish. ı just see small and cute fishes there.ı could see them because water is really clean.the sea is not deep. you can swim how you want. and everybody feel chilly when they tried to enter the sea as water is cold generally. but not here. because water is really really good."
Windy day,"We went to swim but it was too windy but we did enjoy walking along the beach.  We found it to be very clean, perhaps it has been cleaned up?  As it was windy, the beach was deserted and noted not a lot of shade which we would have liked had we swam and then rested.  Still lots of food stalls and vendors with very inexpensive treats, probably discounted because there were so few people.  Lovely beach"
Nice beach for kids,"The sea is great there and water is very shallow, clean and sandy. The colour is beautiful and reminds me the Caribbean waters. There also few people on the beach selling food but they are quiet and non-hassle.  They sell some fresh food such as mussels filled with rice and lime, fresh water melon or even cooked fresh water prawns. The beach rents parasols and beds but they are quiet expensive but laying on the hot sand with your towel is free. They can't force you to hire stuff since all beaches belong to the government and open for public and tourists. They also sell food and cold beverages at the beach club and the prices are ok."
Great day trip from Cesme,"I took a dolmus from cesme to Ilica and then on to alacati and it was fantastic. I highly recommend coming to this beach its gorgeous and during the off season its practically deserted. The waters is crystal clear it reminded me of being in the Caribbean. Also there is a great pier where i spent much of my day reading a napping looking at the ocean and the greek islands nearby. If you get tired of the beach its very easy to hop over to alacati for lunch, but i could have easily spent my whole day here."
You must try this,"Brilliant, peaceful , blue sky, blue water! Plenty of sun loungers, excellent food and service all covered in your all inclusive package. Transport to and from beach, towels all provided, showers and clean toilets all on site. Staff attentive and courteous sea water not so nice to walk in though. Lots of large stones and danger of sea urchins wear something on your feet."
A nice sea,"I went there in september, but the sea was so wavy so i could not enter and there were only a few person in the sea. But it is clear and has cyristal colors"
Clean it up!,Why does there have to be so much trash on this amazingly beautiful beach???  The water is pleasant even in late Sept. and the beach is so calm perfect for young children.  my kids loved playing in the sand.
Long and romantic,"we walked for 2hours, it was lovely. The water was warm 23 degrees. The people were so friendly, we even took a few photos with locals and a local walked the whole 1 hour stretch with us to show us where the natural thermal pool was. Absolutely lovely. Sand is a tad dirty but walk closer to the water and get your feet wet..you'll love it."
Long stretch of sand,"Beach looks nice on the pictures, but it is not my type of beach. There are no natural shade (trees) there, but sun umbrella and sunchairs can be rented (10$ per person for booth). People who don't mind strong sun will love the white sand/blue water 2 km long beach."
Just a beach,"Narrow line of sand. Almost no rocks at bottom when you going to swim. We were here in the beginning of October and there was a kind of feeling of forbiden space, after end of season"
ok beach,"We heard it was amazing, but did not find it any more than average. It's a beach. virtually empty mid sep"
Ilica Beach,Sunbeds were very close together and we were overcharged for them.Even Turkish people were complaining that the man was charging different amounts .
worth going,"lovely beach, well worth visit. Sun bed hire ranges from 10Tl to 20 Tl each, Best part of beach is just past the Sheriton Hotel"
Warm,"Very nice beach, the water is crystal clear and clean. The beach is sandy, but too bad that the people don't always throw their trash to the bin ! I was expecting the water to be cooler, but thank god it wasn't, on the contrary it was very refreshing and not as cold as I had thought it would be, even in September. Having been to the Black Sea (Ağva) last year in September, Ilica was much warmer, but not as warm as Kalkan or Kaputaş (been there also in September) which is in the Mediterreanean. It was somewhere between both, so quite enjoyable !"
Great,"Sea is great, beatiful n sandy beaches are beautiful. A carabbean atmosphere. You always have a nice breeze."
Very nice beach!,"Ilica beach is a very nice beach close to the city of Cesme (about 3km). It is easy accessible, if you use the local liitle buses (dolmus), it takes 5-10 min. and you need 3 TL to get there. The water is very clean, you can enjoy swimming and there are a lot of sunbeds and cafe-restaurants on the beach. You can choose from a big number of hotels, starting from cheap appartements to luxury big hotels."
Perfect sand and water but,Ilıca has a perfect sand and water combination. Water is very clean and waves are part of enjoy with family or friends. One umbrella and sunbed is 15 lira per day but you do not get any service. Food sold around is only fast food and there is not much choice. If tou want only sea enjoy this is the place. If you are looking for also servicea try beaches at Aya Yorgi area.
The best in Turkish aegean region,"The water was warm and clean, the sand good, the coastline big. And above all, the colours of the sea was tropical"
"The hippest, cleanest public beach in Turkey","The general (and mostly true) assumption about public beaches in Turkey is that they are not very popular with most Turkish individuals & families who belong to the upper-intermediate social & economic classes. Ilıca Beach, however, totally beats this assumption, because it is mostly frequented by well-behaving, well educated local people of Izmir & Çeşme. Strange sights, which are rather familiar in most public beaches, such as barbecuing groups, soccer playing children (and even adults) do not exist in Ilıca Beach. And that is not because there is a ban against these strange & disturbing activities, but probably because Ilıca beach simply attracts more civilized crowds.The only setback could be overcrowds on July and August weekends."
Lovely warm beach,My kids loves this beach.they played all the day there.near by there were nice coffee shop which was really convenient. Amazing clear water very shallow good for kids.for the adult can be trying.
warm water...can be too windy sometimes.,"crystal clear and warm water. Sometimes can be too windy and there´s a lack on the services, could be improved.Anyway it´s a pleasant beach to spend a few hours or all day."
warmest beach,"this beach is the warmest on the whole cesme penninsula. best visited in the mornings as it can get crowded. amazing clear water, mostly flat and shallow - ideal for children."
Beautiful,"I have traveled all over the Greece, but I haven't seen such a beach on Aegean coast. Probably best beach in Aegean part of Turkey, white sand, long coast and turquoise see. For those who love waves and warm see, best choice!"
Amazing beach in week,"If place is not crowded and wind is decent, it is a great beach. Try to go in week. It is easy to reach from Izmir. So it may be unpleasantly crowded in weekend."
Great Beach,"White sandy beach with cristaline blue warm waters and shallow sea. It can become windy at times.The hotel in which we stayed, otel yeni, owns the Eastern part of the beach. It is lovely, but can get too crowed or windy at times."
Nice long beach,"I liked that it has crystal clear, shallow, sandy waters. Sheraton's private beach is great but pricey ($25-50 depending on what day). It also features water sports, which I love."
Beautiful beach,The sand is soft and golden.  There always seemed to be a sun bed available so there was no problem as to where to sit.  Lovely beach bars as well..
Excellent beach,"The part of the beach we used was slightly to the east of the port. Great sandy beach (though with some stony bits underfoot), very warm water staying shallow a long way out. We paid 20TL for two sunbeds and a parasol, there was a café and changing rooms etc. on hand. The only problem was that we chose a windy day and, after about two hours, felt a little bit chilly under the parasol but too hot without it!"
great sandy beach with shallow water,"This is a public beach next to the sheraton. We had no problem parking the car on the streets next to the beach. The beds/umbrellas are quite expensive for a public beach (40TL for two beds and one parasol), but definitely a necessity because the sun can get brutal. Water is nice blue, shallow for a long time. Not really a restaurant nearby but you can order burgers and fries. Otherwise there is a street behind the hotel with shops an a few small restaurants."
Lovely,"We came here early morning and it was a lovely time, playing with the water and all. Beach has fine sands and water is so calm and clear. Love the sun rise coming out from this area. Low season is a good time to come here, as it is quiet, you can enjoy the beach and view more. :) Some beach restaurants and clubs in the area so i bet during high season this place will be very crowded. But still if you come to Cesme, better come here. :)"
Beach,"A wonderful stretch of sand and beautiful sea, unfortunately lacking in good facilities and spoilt by litter. This was v early in the season and may be corrected next month."
Golden Sands of Çeşme,One of the longest beaches in Turkey. Ilıca beach has very fine sand. Free to enter but some of the parts has beach clubs and hotels so you need to pay if you want to enter those parts.
Best beach in May-September and October,"This famous long sandy beach is located on the crystal clean waters of Ilica area. When the wind is strong it's a perfect place for playing with the waves, when it's calm the water quality is absolutely perfect. The only thing is that it's overcrowded during the high season."
hotel beach,closest hotel - 4 miles away - food better here than at our hotel so we had to spend time here every day
Beautiful Family Beach,"It is one of the nice beach of West Turkey. Fabulous crustal  clear sea & sandy beach. There is no music, which it makes place peaceful.. But you need to catch the good weather to go. In the windy weather we found very difficult to swim. However when the weather nice and calm its a big pleasure to be there."
sandy beach,"liked the great beach nice and sandy the further up you walked the sandier it became crystal clear water and calm sea, able to walk out 50m or so before depth too deep"
A great beach,"Easy to get to on public transport, great for the children and great amenities.  Supermarket is a 2 min stroll if you wanted any snacks, drinks etc."
Turkey's best kept secret.,"The beach in Ilica is lovely and sandy and the sea is delightfully warm. It is particularly good for families as the  sea is shallow for a long way out. The beach was a little crowded this year, and unfortunately the sea was not as clean as usual.It is expensive to hire a sunbed and umbrella,nut given the heat in August it is absolutely necessary. Be careful - you don;t always notice how hot it is because there is always a refreshing wind."
Great sandy beach,"great for kids,  shallow water for about 10 yards then starts to go deeper,water nice and warm and a nice breeze all day long"
"amazing, but windy","Great beach, 1,7 km long! Keep in mind that it's constantly windy there. There is a cafe and bed rentals on the very left, that has a wi-fi."
What a beach,"Fantastic beach. Nice sand. Open to public. Affordable! I highly recommend ""Kucuk Plaj"". Free parking, 10TL ($5US) per person for tanning beds. Free wifi. Friendly service."
Great Public Beach,"Ilıca is the one of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey. This is a public beach with small cafes and parasol&sunbed renters. There is Sheraton Hotel near the middle of the beach but you can pass through it by walking. This beach is even more stunning if you can visit it when there isn't any wind from the northerly directions, unfortunately 90% of the time it is very windy! The food and drinks sold along the beach are modestly priced especially compared to the expensive beach clubs of Cesme. One parasol and two sunbeds can be rented for 20-25TL or you can directly lay on the warm sandy beach! The water is quite warm compared to other areas in Cesme thanks to warm underground water coming to surface near the beach. You should definitely check it out if you are in the region. One warning, on Sundays it is very crowded so try to avoid it on Sundays."
beautiful beach,"This is a great beach, and the sand was great! We always ho there and cant recommend it more. Its a really great beach and the sea is so sandy as well."
Fascinating,I believe Ilica beach is one of the most attractive coast in the Europe and if you come to cesme or izmir you must see such a beautiful scene!
"Great beach, music too loud","The water is clear, clean and shallow. It was warm and calm and we loved every minute of the view. The music in the beach clubs could have been quieter though. I am not a fan of techno music at 11am on a calm beach. I'd rather listen to the calm waves."
great beach!,"take a walk to Ilıca Beach, find a spot you enjoy and pay a fair amount for umbrella / beach bed rental, and you're set to enjoy one of the nicest public beaches around Çeşme. The small huts around serve beer to enjoy too!"
Top beach,"Compares well to great beaches other parts of the world. Very calm water, great for swimming. Beautiful view; wasn't crowded when we were there in June (though it apparently gets full later in the summer)."
kiteboarded in the off season,"We were there in the off-season and did some kite boarding on this beach. It's gorgeous... A half-moon white sand beach. It was quiet while we were there, although I can imagine it being fairly crowded during August. Things are a little over-priced, even in the off-season, but I would come back here any time (except maybe August...) We met a bunch of great people on the beach.Also, to note for backpackers: there was a tent set up on the beach. It seems tent-friendly on the off-season. (I did that in Cannes a few years ago...not a bad way to get the best views...)"
"Amazing calm clear sea, altinkums better though!","The sea is crystal clear and completely calm and shallow, great for kids. The beach gets really busy though and isn't the nicest as is very built up. Altinkum beach (golden beach) is much better and has no buildings just sand dunes and really does feel like a tropical paradise"
Favourite Beach,"Love this beach, probably my favourite! White sands and crystal clear and clean waters. If this beach was full with palms trees it would give the Caribbean beaches a lot of competition indeed! It is windy- but I think this makes it perfect and much more comfortable to sunbathe all day. This beach has a lovely area where you can chill out at the end of the day and just enjoy the hot springs whilst in the ocean, it's on the left hand side of the sheraton hotel where their is a pier with rocks, walk down and you will find it on the right. Ilica area is lovely and very scenic.  In fact the whole of Cesme is absolutely lovely and worth seeing and in my opinion one of the best holiday destinations!"
Bit windy but excellent beach,"Clean white sand. Gets crowded during the weekends. The water is transparent. It does not get deep suddenly, one may need to walk in the sea before swimming. It is surrounded by luxurious single story beach houses."
very nice beach but windy,This is a very nice place swim and sunbathing. but the strong wind never stops. It is becoming annoying after you spend some time. the houses in front of the beach are fabulous.
Lovely beach,"Is a lovely beach, very slowly shelving with soft sand and lots of fish!!!  The water is full of thermal areas, so some bits are lovely and warm.  Ilica is a lovely village with some good restaurants."
"Its in my Hotel review, read it and follow my instructions ( yellow beds) the beer is 3 lr cheaper here than up the beac","It has the warmest water in the area Other people told me this and there were a lot of Turkish people there, once they hear you speak they will want to talk to you."
you should spend time there!,"very clean and long beach. water is not cold compared to other beaches'. what I dislike is wind. If weather is not hot, you could be cold."
Nicest beach in Cesme,"Avoid on Sundays as it will be full of people on a day-trip to Cesme. If you can manage weekdays, you can enjoy much better. Other great beaches in Cesme are Altinkum and Pirlanda (quite close to each other) but their water is usually much colder than Ilıca."
free,"It was free, the sea was lovely and warm, this was our favourite beach in Cesme. It was very busy though"
Only during weekdays,"The sea there is clean however it is mostly wavy and shallow. However, it has an amazing color that makes you feel like you're in the Maldives. Avoid going on weekends as it will be extremely crowded and you won't be able to relax"
One of the best beaches in Turkey,"Ilica beach, is blue flag, and has 2 kilometres of silver sand. The waters are azure(even in the winter months) and are shallow, thermal, and a delight to bathe in.Does get very crowded at weekends in high season, when lots of turkish people escape the heat of the city."
Best beach for families,"Hot water, lots of waves but kids will love it. I prefer cold sea water so its not for me. Almost always windy but it feels good when you are under sunshine all day. I am going to Ilıca for 15 years every summer, it is becoming more crowded every year. Never, never ever go to that beach on a Sunday or a Saturday and I mean it, never!!! It will be misery! Other weekdays are like heaven."
Turquoise,"The water is a dream: turquoise blue, calm and with warm temperature... the waves are minimal and the beach is beautiful."
Just like being in your bathtub...,"Thanks to the natural hot springs that are in and around the Ilaca Beach area, the water is VERY warm and very refreshing. You can walk 100 paces out into the water and still not have the water higher than your chest level. The waves are minimal and the beach is beautiful white sands with only a few rocks here and there in the water. With a little searching, we were able to find a wonderful spot that had only a couple rocks. Otherwise it was sandy all the way out..."
Sand and sea,"It may sound very casual wait untill you are therrYou will get the best, the days we were there it was mildly crowdedwhich made it even better"
nice beach,"beach is good and clean, you can use sheraton hotel's beach(60tl per day) or other beaches (15tl per day) or public beach for free. but my recommendation would be the aya yorgi beach and cafe pi sera beach. it's much more cheap(15tl per day) and nicer than the other areas in cesme."
Fantastic beach,Great place very clean food was excellent staff very good plenty of room at the top near the bar and restaurant
Beach,It was very hot when we were there but there is shade and bars on the beach
turquaise sea:-),"it is better thanHawaii:-) clean, sandy beach. The water is always warm."
lovely beach,we had great time.beatiful sea lovely atmosphere.come back again
Must!,It is a busy beach especially during the weekends. The sea is warmer compared to other beaches in Çeşme. Highly recommended!
Busy Beach,"Ilica Beach is a popular beach, but nonetheless the water is clear and appealing to swim in. Just around the corner from the beach, a 15 minute walk to the stone sea wall, are natural thermal pools where the locals go. As the footing is uncertain take good shoes. It is well worth the visit to soak in the at times near boiling water for an authentic and free Turkish experience!"
Amazing Beach,One of the most beautiful beaches in İzmir - Çeşme.
Paradise beach,"The beach itself is normal, but the water is a dream: turquoise blue, calm and with good temperature. Definitely the best beacj around Çesme"
Class,"Went to Cesme last summer with friends.   As we had never been to Turkey before, I did'nt know what to expect.  Cesme is in the northern part of Turkey, away from the more tourist areas down south.  Absolutely beautiful.  Loads to do and see and the most beautiful beaches.  Illica beach is just class.  Beautiful tourquise sea.  Our friends brought us to the most beautiful little village / resort area.  'Alacati.....please, please google on Tripadvisor.  I have never been to a more prettier place, reminded me of Greece a little.  Very, very sophisticated, but still sooooo charming.  Fabulous restaurants and quaint little coffee shops and cafes.  Alacati is famous for its stonework and growing heather.  This adds so much to the whole charm of the area.  Please check out."
Best beach in the İzmir area,"The beach is very wide and long for the Aegean region. Beautiful turquoise waters. The beach is kept clean. Excellent for waders and children. There are toilets, beverage and food kiosks spaced roughly 250 m apart. The beach is situated well from hotels and excellent night life."
beautiful beach,"white sand, crystal clear water- fish swimming around your feet - however unfortunately it is covered in cigarette butts - I have never seen so many - they need a sand cleaner down there or the tourists need to take their butts home with them. We just laid out 2 towels each so we didn't have to look at them. This did not hamper our visits there, it was just disappointing to see such a lack of respect for such a beautiful envionment. There is also a boardwalk which a lot of people laid on, so maybe that's what you do to avoid the butts."
Best beach in Cesme,In my experience this is the best beach in Cesme. The water is very clear and the beach is clean. It isn't the widest beach and therefore the opportunities for playing in the sand isn't always the best.
"Could be best beach of the world, but...","Long sandy beach, great sea... The beaxch is quite dirty, they charge 10 € for an umbrella, but they do not gve any service.I was there in August 2011 when the local people organized an event to clean the beach. You cannot imagine what kind of material they collected."
"Iica Beach, best on a calm day","Great beach with lots of room to spread out during the weekdays, but get busy on Sundays.  This beach can be very windy, as which point the water is less pleasant. On a calm day, the water is lovely and warm, and the long sandy beach is perfect. There are also useful shops a few roads back, and an easy walk to Cesme town."
