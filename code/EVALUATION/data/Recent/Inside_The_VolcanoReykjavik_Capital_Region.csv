Unique experience,"It was an incredible experience to be inside the volcano and I can recommend the tour. The guides were informative and friendly, and the soup was good."
The colorful insides of a volcano,After a nice walk over lava fields covered in lush green moss we descended into the colorful volcano. Friendly guidance and the hot soup at the end of our visit to the volcano was worth the whole trip. 😎
"Good tour, but expensive","It is interesting and unique to be able to descend into a extinct volcano. The tour, comprising a hike to the volcano, descent and about 30 minutes inside, is all as expected. If anything I was slightly underwhelmed, but perhaps I had read too much marketing material on the trip. It is good, no question, but it is very expensive and you’d really have to be not too concerned about money to feel ok spending over £500 for two people. It is poor value for money but presumably that just reflects the demand and there are evidently plenty of willing customers."
Unique experience ,I kept wondering about all the fantastic reviews and whether it would really be worth it until I was in the chamber myself and felt awe and wonder rise up. It’s like being in a cathedral built by Mother Earth. I’ve never seen anything like this before and I’m a seasoned traveller. In one word - wow!
unique,"I can't deny, indeed it IS expensive, but it's worth all the money as it gives you unforgettable impressions for a life-time!"
Great experience! Would definitely recommend it.,Well organized. Nice tour guides and staff. Both landscape and the volcano are amazing. Would definitely recommend it :)
Better than expected,"As Icelanders, me and my wife knew more or less what to expect on the hiking tour to the location of Þríhnjúkagígur (the Icelandic name of the crater). The walk to the crater can be challenging for those that are not used to this semi-wildness. I had my best hiking boots on and was thankful for that.   We've been planning to go on this tour for some years but now was a great opportunity, for us ""locals"" to go. Many of my friends have already been inside the volcano and highly recommended the tour. What I did not expect are the colours. I thought most of the pictures I’ve seen where photoshopped or something, but the colours are real. As a sort of geology geek, this was an experience I would not have liked to miss. The staff was very professional and security centred, both because of the environment and the current Covid-19 situation. 5 stars to Inside the Volcano."
2 The Center of the Earth,"My son who has done that adventure 2 years ago highly recommended that to me.And it is stunning, unbelieveable.If you really wanna know what vulcanism is all about there is no better way to get in touch with this complex matter.Although it is not cheap it is absolutely worth every single cent.And with Kalle and Alexa we enjoyed an unforgettable day under the earth.We will come back for sure.Gratefully yours Christian (Austria) and Sabine (Germany)"
A lifetime experience,"This was a spectacular expedition to the centre of the earth. I was amazed by what I saw. This was really unique experience you won't find anywhere else in  lceland. The guides were very knowledgeable, nice and funny and took a good care of us. They even cooked a lamb soup for us. Best I have ever had! For me, this tour was a gem 💎 and I will ever hardly forget anything of it."
Good,"Super nice people guiding the tour.I missed faces and ""education"" about the geologic phenomenon.If i have a car drive to the meeting point yourself, especially if you want the maximum out of your time in beautiful iceland"
impressively,"My favorite was the colors inside the volcano.It was a greet experiennce for me. I saw with my own eyes what I had been telling my students about for many years. About plate tectonics and volcanism.Nobody can do anything for the terrible weather. Luckily we got warm drinks and a tasty soup, Kjötsupa.Thanks to our Icelandic companions.Karin"
Trip into the belly of the volcano,"Maybe a bit costly, due to the high annual set-up and maintenance costs, but worth visiting. The walk to the volcano is necessary, but not so exiting..."
"Eindrucksvoll, aber sehr teuer","The desire to go into an extinct volcanic cone led to booking this excursion. You walk 45 minutes to get there - in our case in pouring rain and strong wind. In the 'base camp' you could warm up with coffee. The impressions inside the vulcano are very special, the colors and the size of it all impressive. Before we went home, there was a tasty soup in the base camp.You have to decide beforehand whether it is worth spending so much money on it because it is exorbitantly expensive.Included in the ticket is the transfer from the hotel in Reykjavik to the volcano and back. If you do not live in Reykjavik, but come from the other direction with your own car, this is unfortunately not reflected in a price reduction."
Epic tour!,This was such an epic tour! The guides were very caring and made us feel totally safe. This was the best adventure of our entire trip to Iceland!
Once in a lifetime experience!,"Absolutely amazing experience...the friendly staff and the minimal impact of the place/operation on the surrounding nature was a big plus in my books. The awesome elevator journey into the volcano was as much a part of the visit as the cavernous enclosed magma chamber itself, 120 meters into the ground, greeting us with stunning rock formations in vibrant colors. Last but not least, the wonderful soup served upon our return to the surface was a welcome surprise. Highly recommend this adventure!"
Inside the volcano ,"I'm bit on the heavy side, the day I went it was heavy rain and wind, it seemed a long way to the volcano but the guides were very encouraging and helpful. Once in the volcano all was forgotten with the view inside. The walk back to the car park was a  killer, I was soaked to the skin. Back at the hotel straight into the hot tub"
Otherwordly experience,The experience started with a beautiful hike through a lavafield. We could already see Thrinukagigur volcano. The staff at the hut was super friendly and informed us about everything of importance. AND THEN came the descent into the magmachamber!!! WOW! We basically couldn´t keep our mouths shut- we were so extremely overwhelmed. The atmosphere inside the chamber was simply otherworldly. It is just so difficult to put this experience into words. WE LOVED IT! Thanks so much to everyone in the team who made this tour so special. We will keep it memorized forever. ...The meat soup after the trip inside the chamber was a very delicious treat as well.
Come for T's soup!,"The day of our trip was rainy, windy and chilly, the real end to an Icelandic summer. Though we had our own water poof gear, we could see this was not going to enough protection so thankfully R and S our guides, directed us toward an array of waterproof macintoshes which kept us dry to the base camp. Being  lowered in to a volcano was incredible and the colours staggering. R and the other guides were constantly at hand to answer all our questions and with great humour. Forget going to the Blue Lagoon. Do this instead."
Do not miss this,a great experience.  one of the best things we did in Iceland. The walk over the lava fields and the view down to reykjavik was gorgeous.  But the trip inside the volcano was like nothing else
Must visit,"Brilliant place to visitExcellent and friendly guidesLast but not least tasty soup, got vegan too :)"
Amazing,An amazing experience!The walk across the lava field and the interior of the volcano were breathtaking. Our guide was awesome and gave great information about the area. The warm soup afterwards was delicious. Definetly a highlight in all of Iceland!
Inside the Volcano ,"Absolutely fantastic, very nice guides! Once in a lifetime experience. High price but it is worth it because of the uniqueness of the place and the technical complicated access to the volcano."
Fantastic,Fantastic experience - just the walk across the lava fields was stunning enough! Coffee prior to going into the volcano and soup afterwards made the cold interior bearable! Such an amazing morning.
Must do in Iceland,Great experience and really a must do during Iceland trip. We made this trip at the end of our 2 week trip and it was our highlight.
Very good,It was a great trip and there is no other place in the world to do it. The guides were awesome and did an awesome job showing us a lava tube as an „extra“. However bad weather made the hike to the vulcano extremely annoying and the price is imo a little over the top. Good overall :)Sven
We will never forget!,"Stunning an overwhelming experience, that you should not miss.First you do an about 45min hike with through a lava field and a stunning view.An Elevator then brings you down about 120m into the volcano. Still nobody knows, why this volcano didn't collaps (as they obviously usually do). Something really very special - with big heartbeat moments!"
The highlight of many years of travel.,"This was a once in a lifetime experience, to actually be inside a volcano's crater.The colour and the shape of the lava is unbelievable and the guides were very skilful and nice people."
A windy rainy super day in Iceland ,3 brothers gave our father (80) and mother (76) this trip and we were super happy. Awesome everything
The only place in the world you can do this!,"If you want to experience something unique, this might be the attraction for you.The thrill of being lowered down more than 100 meters into a volcano while studying serveral types of rock and the spectacular colours is truly exceptional. This should be  on everyone's bucket list.We were picked up at our hotel in Reykjavik and transported to the meeting point in Bláfjöll, at the ski-resort. The drive is around 30 minutes.From there, it is a 3 km hike to the ""base camp"" at the volcano. The path is of moderate difficulty and takes about 45 minutes.On arrival there is a short information session and the participants are divided into groups, as there is only room for about 8 in the lift.Everybody is equipped with a harness and helmet before the 5 minute walk to the top of the volcano.There is a short walk-bridge to the lift, and inside the lift everybody is secured.The journey to the interior is very interesting and the lift operator gives much information about the rocks the lift passes. At one point the shaft is so narrow that the lift touches the side. Keep your hands inside!Once down in the bottom of the crater there is about 30-40 minutes to explore before having to go up again.There is a sort of a path one can follow around but it is is quite steep at times and rocky. The view of the walls of the crater is spectacular.Once back at the ""base camp"", soup is served.There is time to take a short walk around the area before hiking back to the meeting point for the transport back to Reykjavik.The total time was just over 5 hours for us.If you want to save time, flying to the volcano with helicopter is a good alternative."
Do you anybody who was inside a volcano?,This tour was one of my highlights during my stay in Reykjavik. After a short drive to the skiing area just outside of Reykjavik you do a short hike to the bottom of the volcano. There you get a saftey briefing and equipment. Afterwards you gonna expierence another world inside the volcano. Its too awesome words could describe it.
"A must do, when in Iceland","A truly amazing, once in a lifetime event. It's not just a visit, it's an experience. From the meeting point, through a lava-landscape with a very friendly, funny guide that gave quite some information on the origin of the field and the volcano. Then the instruction in the guestcottage, again with such funny, energetic and friendly people offering tee and coffee.  That last moments, running to the top to what we were here for: the way down into the volcano with a highly informing guide, slowly letting us down and then like half an hour free time in the volcano. Just watching all those magnificent colours. Back in the cottage getting soup, tee and coffee. In all: worth every euro! Really recommend everybody to do this (if affordable ofcourse)"
Beautiful and so Exiting Tour,"This was amazing, I have never experienced something like this in my life!!!I was so exited about this tour  that I wanted to explode. 😄 Will never for get this, will be life time experience. The walk was much easier than I was expecting, I did not had a hiking shoes, but it was fine. I did not had any drinks or food with me too, but it was fine guides take care of us and even maid us really tasty Icelandic soup.Most important to dress up warm and you can enjoy the tour in full."
Once in a lifetime,"This truely is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Prices are steep, but in the end it's definitely worth it. You start of with a drive of about an hour from Reykjavik to the main building at the Thrihnukagigur site, where you get a short instruction and some tea and cookies. After that you walk through a lava field towards the volcano. At base camp you are equipped with all the necessities, after which go down the shaft of the volcano by a small lift. The colours inside are so beautiful and the whole experience is surreal. You get to walk around for about half an hour, which is enough to do a small circle on the magma chamber floor and take tons of photos. Afterwards you get some soup and walk back to the main building. If you're lucky you might see a polar fox as well."
Amazing volcano tour!,"Such an amazing and unique experience! The walk to and from the volcano was very nice and easy (the rugged Icelandic scenery was just amazing).  Being inside the volcano and hearing about its history was quite enjoyable and breathtaking.  It was also nice to chill at the base camp and eat soup / relax.  I was lucky enough to see the arctic fox that hangs around (she was definitely a bonus!).   Also, my husband and I were originally supposed to take this tour in the morning, but our flight into Reykjavik was very delayed and we arrived close to midnight.  But luckily we were able to easily switch our tour time to one of the later ones in the day no problem so we could be well rested."
FANTASTIC,Superb tour and guides. I enjoyed the sightseeing and learned about the geological history of the region.
Once in a lifetime experience,Trip was absolutely worth its price. Everything very well organised from pick-up to drop off. Going down inside volcano was incredible experience. I enjoyed every moment. Bear in mind trip operates only in the summer.
Inside the volcano,"This experience only runs from spring till end of Oct as apparently the weather turns too nasty Nov onwards to conduct it without constant cancellations.We were there on the last day of the season.It's about 45 mins from the city centre. When you get there you get a short briefing and then it's a 40 min walk over the mossy volcanic fields - quite cool for pictures - till you each what they call base camp.We were divided up into 3 groups who went into the volcano one at a time.They kit you out with a helmet and an overall with harness hooks. When it's your turn it's 5 mins to the mouth of the volcano. You're strapped in and lowered in an open lift for about 5 mins till you reach the bottom.It's v cool being inside the volcano. You can walk around a bit but not a lot. The colours are fab. You have c20 mins down there before going back up  and they give you soup before you walk back to the tour bus. Watch out, there are no proper bathrooms there so go before."
Mesmerising,"After a welcome briefing with coffee and biscuits there was a guided 45 minute walk across lava fields to the volcano  base camp.  Lots of information provided on the way on geography, history, lava, pyroclastic flows, magma.  Further briefing at basecamp and then a short walk up the side of the volcano to the entry point and into a lift down to the floor of the cavern where you scamble up and down to traverse around the floor of the volcano(if you prefer you can stay by the lift and just soak up the atmosphere).  After the return by lift and back to base camp for sensational  home made soup (veggie or with meat).  Then a wander around base camp (saw a snow fox) before the walk back.  I cannot recommend this experience highly enough, a must do."
Wonderful experience!,"Six of us, ages 26-66, thoroughly enjoyed it. Never experienced anything like it. The guides were excellent. Truly once-in-a-lifetime. And the best soup I've ever eaten in my life! Thank you all!"
Most incredible experience in Iceland,"Our trip to Iceland was incredible. We snorkeled between the tectonic plates, saw the Northern Lights, hiked a glacier but hands down, this was our favorite activity. The guides were great, the volcano was incredible and also very unique in the sense that the group is so small and you feel alone in the volcano. It does not have the vibe of a touristy attraction.It's definitely one in a lifetime experience! If you are in Iceland, you need to do it! The price is steep but it's so worth it. I don't know what could beat this adventure and we travel a lot."
Volcano tour,"After a very brisk 45 min walk in rain (easy walk) we arrived and were lifted 5 at a time to bottom of volcano on something that looks like it washes windows on a high rise. It was incredible. Very safe. Were had safety harnesses on clipped in, but it was very smooth and easy. After served lunch at base station of hot lamb stew or vege stew. Delicious!!!Then had to walk 45 minutes back. Well worth the trip. So unique and different. Very beautiful inside volcano ! Colors were incredible Loved the tour"
Once in a Lifetime Experience!,"If you have the opportunity to experience this, do it. It's nothing short of amazing. It was top 5 highlights of our trip to Iceland. The hike to the volcano for us was easy as we had really great weather. So glad we could experience the Volcano...it was incredible!"
Incredible experience,"I had the opportunity to do this excursion which did not disappoint. The hike up wasn't too bad even though the wind was blowing quite a bit, but you can't stop mother nature. Once we reached the station located right next to the volcano we were able to warm up with hot beverages and given instructions for going into the volcano. The lift was super cool and once inside it was like nothing I have ever experienced. It was so beautiful, quiet, extremely peaceful, and relaxing. Having the opportunity to witness something so historic was nothing short of amazing. Go do this tour before it is changed to a tunnel with a viewing area only! Yes it was a bit pricey but worth every penny!!! You only live once and this is an absolute must!"
Otherworldly and wondrous,"This experience is one of a kind. The hike part is really lovely, the staff is knowledgable and warm, but the volcano itself inspires awe and wonder. Absolute gem."
Amazing once in a lifetime experience,"It’s a flat but longish walk to the crater, once there you wait briefly in a small hit for your turn to take the lift down inside the volcano.  Being inside was just Amazing and our guides were wonderful. On the walk back it drizzled enough to soak our jeans through so I’d bring rain pants if I were to go again. Definitely worth it, quite an adventure!"
Top three experiences in Iceland,"I found out about this tour reading various guidebooks and it did not disappoint, in fact it was one of the highlights on our trip! In fact one of the other people on our tour said she actually came back to Iceland to do it! We did the hotel pick up which was very convenient (and when we had a question about where the stop was the response time was within the hour via email).The guides were very knowledgeable, safety conscious, and friendly (offering to take pictures without being asked and doing a great job of it I might add!)The hike in good weather was moderate. We hit some bad weather on the way back but the rush of completing it was well worth it! The scenery was beautiful and it’s not every day you get to hike through a lava field. Going down into the volcano was simply breathtaking. Once you get into the magma chamber even more so. Pictures (or even videos) do not do the colors or the formations justice. I’m not a huge fan of heights but I was comfortable the entire time. In fact, the guide operating the elevator down actually helped design it!Again, words and pictures cannot do justice to the experience but this was a top three of our entire trip hands down. Highly recommend."
So great!,"Loved this adventure! The walk is a 2 mile walk on flat gravel. It is easy - but if it is raining, it will not be fun. They do offer full size neon raincoats to borrow if you need. Going into the volcano was beautiful! Something that you can only experience in real life. It is the only volcano known that is dormant and stayed in tact (did not become a crater) truly a great sight to see with amazing tour guides."
Iceland Volcano Magic!!,"Great activity to do if you are as fascinated with volcanoes as I am! The whole experience was first class, as described in the pamphlet and was supported by professional staff.We were bused to a staging point approx 3 kms from the base camp - then proceeded  on foot with a guide positioned in front and behind us in a line. It was very cold and the wind was strong. Most of the walk was flat, then rising at the base of the volcano. First stop was base camp to be fitted with harness and safety helmet, then we were led up to the volcano crater. We proceeded to enter the lift at the top of the crater in small groups, being harnessed to the lift on boarding. Then we descended into the crater approx 200 metres where we alighted onto a rubble strewn volcanic base. An area had been roped around the base to assist you exploring the volcano. We had ample opportunity to take photos throughout the whole trip.We had to navigate around the base slowly and carefully due to the rocky filled surface - it provided a good work out!! The view inside the crater was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!It was fabulous to see and touch the inside of the volcano, especially on descent and ascent whilst in the open sided lift.Once the group arrived back at the top, we were led to the base camp - the wind was very strong at this point and I required some help from a guide to stay upright!!Once back inside the warm base camp it was time to thaw out, have a hot drink and eat the delicious bowl of vegetable and lamb soup which had been cooking on the stove since our arrival - YUM!!Then it was time to walk back cross the lava flats to get on the bus- guides were positioned at the front and back of the group again for safety reasons.We had a thouroughly AWESOME time on this trip and I would highly recommend it."
Breathtaking!!,"This was an incredible experience. Our guide, Kamil, was very knowledgeable and helpful. We were offered complimentary refreshments, as well as a soup (with lamb or vegan). The hike to the Basecamp is not hard - but make sure to wear appropriate hiking shoes or boots. You will need them once inside the volcano. At the Basecamp, they give you helmets and harnesses (safety reasons) and then you hike the last part that takes you to the entrance. It is a bit steep, but if you're used to walking and hiking, it's not an issue. Then you will start descending, with a lift. It's a 150 meters (400 feet) descent. Ólafur, who was operating the lift, was explaining various facts about the volcano and the geology. Once you arrive, you can hike around the magma chamber. It's a surreal experience. Unless you are claustrophobic or have vertigo, I highly recommend this tour. If you are lucky, you'll get to meet Íma, the Arctic fox that lives close to the Basecamp."
"Everything was more than perfect! The pick up from the hostel, the staff on the place and the tour that was unbelieble !",I felt in a dream!! The hospitality of the staff and the food and the tea were so good!!I will recommend this company for sure!In one word I will sumarize that : W-O-W!This tour is must for every person that visit Iceland
Friendly and exciting volcano tour,"This tour was in a package that was planned for me. I wasn't too sure of what I would be doing and this tour did not disappoint. I was met by two different guides at arrival for them to break down what we would be doing and rules. They gave us awesome circle scarfs that we could keep. The walk to the volcano was something I wasn't expecting (2 miles) and on gravel. I would definitely recommend some good ankle boots to protect from twisting your ankle. Going down the volcano was exciting and I got the feeling of when you're standing on a high ledge. The natural beauty and various colors at the bottom of the volcano is something that you will remember forever. It is a must see sight and I kept having to remind myself that this is a real volcano and not man made; it was a surreal experience. The staff was nice and friendly and great with educating us about the volcano and its history. After coming back up from the volcano they served us lamb soup or vegetarian soup. I opted for the lamb (I had never had it before bu when in Rome), it was delicious and warmed you back up. I was anticipating the trek back to the home base but I had the pleasure to chat it up with one of the guides which made the two miles back go by very fast."
A MUST EXPERIENCE!!!,"Iceland does not allow big buses into the town so almost all tours require getting a little bus to the main terminal.  Its all very easy.  The trip was well planned and well orchestrated.  They provided everything needed to be safe.  The experience was breathtaking and wonderful, the hike was easy but uneven ground for problem walkers.  I highly recommend this trip!"
Welll Worth it for the Experience,"I did the 'Inside The Volcano' experience last Friday, October 11th.  It did not disappoint.  The bus picked us up from our hotel at the (Grand Hotel) and took us there.  The hike is about 45 minutes and the instructors were very nice and informative.  Inside the volcano was another 30-45 minutes.  It was truly amazing experience.  Afterwards and the meat soup and hiked back.  Loved it."
Inside the Volcano,"Worth the cost! Knowledgeable guides, breathtaking landscape, and once in a lifetime experience. If you have the time and resources, sign up for this tour."
Very Cool Experience,"Overall the trip was very cool. Once we were down in the volcano, we were allowed about 30 minutes to walk around and take pictures. We felt safe the whole time. The tour company was very safety conscious. The walk to the volcano from the base camp was about 40 minutes over mostly flat terrain. You should definitely wear hiking shoes or boots."
This is much more than just visiting a volcano,"This excursion was outstanding. Timely and convenient transportation from and back to my hotel. After a briefing, we hiked through a lava field. It is hard to describe the beauty of this landscape. The whole team was friendly, knowledgeable, and open to conversations and questions about the site and its history. Sitting within a volcano is awe-inspiring, After coming back to base camp, we enjoyed a lamb stew which was absolutely delicious (a vegetarian option is available), coffee or tea. The whole experience is very safe and well run. I felt that the money I invested in this opportunity was well spent. No regrets."
"Amazing once in a life time trip, completely worth the money!","This was the highlight of our trip to Iceland! The staff and guides were amazing, they were knowledgeable, friendly, and very hospitable. The volcano is incredible! If you are considering it but not wanting to pay the money, just do it, you only get to do this once, and this is the only volcano in the world you can go inside so take advantage of the great opportunity! They also served homemade lamb soup after, as well as tea and hot chocolate. It was incredible! My husband and I will hopefully do it again one day!"
Once in a Lifetime Experience,"This was truly an experience we will remember forever. I'm afraid of heights but the previous reviews were so wonderful, I decided to go for it.  The tour staff are knowledgeable, friendly, patient and ultra safety conscious.  I felt secure and confident all the way. The ride down and up takes about 6 minutes each way and was very smooth. Every aspect to the experience was fascinating.  the walk to the volcano, the ride down, and the time to explore at the bottom. Spectacular colors, interesting rock formations, and you truly get a sense of the primal geological history of our planet. I am so glad that we did this.  We had walking sticks along for the hike to the volcano, but did not need them. I would recommend hiking boots because the lava field has lots of uneven surfaces.  Worth every penny!"
Bad weather but still 5/5,"An unforgettable experience! The walk to and from the volcano was beautiful, the guides were great and we even visited a lava tunnel on the way back."
Thrihnukagigur Volcano Tour | Go Inside a Magma Chamber,I joined this tour on 22/9/19 @9.30am.It was an excellent trip.Highly recommend this tour.Thanks.
Outstanding experience,"Super friendly guides. Comfortable but exciting tour. Expensive but unique and seems like a possibly perishable experience, so worth it with two kids, one of whom is currently studying volcanoes in school. Lovely hike. Delicious soup. Practice saying Þríhnúkagígur. Ftw, artic fox, Pila!!!"
The reason I came to Iceland,"I am a geologist. When I discovered this tour existed, I simply had to go! It was wonderful. The guides were friendly, knowledgable and welcoming. The soup was perfect for a warm up after the tour.I loved it!"
Worth every penny,"My husband and I have traveled all over the world, and this is one of the top experiences we’ve ever done. Getting to go inside a volcano, seeing all the colors, the funny guides, the beautiful hike out, there were so many factors make this a must-do tour!"
Amazing Trip,This is a great hike and trip into the volcano! Was very interesting! Highly Recommended. The only down side is that we didn't get to see Ima the Arctic Fox. Maybe next time!
Spectacular view inside the volcano & delicious lamb soup.,"This can be one of the coolest experiences I had to go deep down the crater. It is beautiful and colorful inside. Luckily, the weather was pretty nice when we visited there, and  therefore, I didn’t feel so cold and moist inside the volcano. By the way, the lamb soup tase good and the staffs at the base camp are friendly."
"One of the best tours, if not the best!","Definitely amazing tour. Organization is simply perfect, the best in Iceland - you have enough time for hiking this beautiful area, few stops on the way during which guide explains ""how everything happened"", coffe&meals on the way and of course amazing trip to the volcano.Volcano itself is way more beautiful than on photos, which is very uncommon to tourist attractions in Iceland ;) You really need to see and feel it yourself.Tips before going to the tour - bring really warm clothes. Really warm. You don't need to bring drinks or food - everything is provided by the organizer, including delicious lamb soup."
An unforgettable experience,It's an incredible atmosphere down inside a volcano. This tour was led by a great group easy going yet experienced guides.
Volcano/Hike,"Wonderful experience.  It’s just under 2 miles to walk to the volcano and back.  You get dropped down in groups but stay at basecamp while you are waiting where there is water, tea coffee and at the end soup.  Must do experience!"
Lifetime experience,"A must do in a lifetime! This is a unique experience that you won't ever forget.The scenario is it magical, lost in the middle of nowhere, you will have to walk a very easy hike that makes everything better! Stunning views, when we you arrive in the volcano there is a hut with all the equipment and they serve delicious lamb soup that you can eat with the company of all the team and a super charming arctic fox called Inma that they rescued. Inside the volcano everything seems from another world, it is magic and super worth it. I totally recommend it!"
A geological feature that is unique in the world.- must be one for the list !,"What an amazing experience visiting this place, Apparently it's the only one of it's kind. A cathedral size volcanic chamber 120m deep, accessed through a chimney in the surface cone. The rocks must include every colour and hue you could imagine. Some surfaces and features are iridescent. The safety arrangements and descent into the volcano are first class, carried out by experienced staff. Their knowledge, enthusiasm, gentle humour and friendly approach adds to the whole experience. The 3km walk was in quite difficult weather conditions, but on a well laid out path, with excellent support from guides. Weatherproof outer coats were provided along with safety harness, safety helmet and head mounted lights were provided along with patient assistance in fitting all. A good camaraderie began to emerge within our group which added to the occasion. The guides / staff were generous, professional and friendly hosts to all concerned. The soup (meat & veg and veg only) went down extremely well with seconds ! There was also tea, coffee and water to end what was a memorable and exciting day. Also transport to / from Reykjavic was well co-ordinated. Thank you to all concerned. ps apologies I haven't sorted out my images and movies as yet to attach to the review."
Inside the Volcano!,"This was an awesome experience! The 2 mile walk to the volcano (and 2 mile walk back!) despite 40 mph winds ad driving rain was an incredible experience! Oh yes, the 400 feet dive into the volcano was cool too! The tour guides did an amazing job of welcoming us to the base camp, getting us prepared for the trip into the volcano, and explaining everything. When we got back they had lamb soup waiting for us! Overall an outstanding experience and I would highly recommend. Caution: Although the 2 mile walk is not too difficult, it can be a little challenging in the wind/rain for some folks. If you go and they are predicting wind/rain, make sure you have waterproof shoes and as much water proof gear as possible! Although they provide nice rain/wind ponchos, you will still a little wet! But it is well with the adventure!"
Out of this world,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime type of trip.  The organisation of the tour is fantastic, the guides are really friendly and informative - and the volcano is extraordinary.  Beforehand we had been slightly concerned by the hike to the volcano - but we found it fine.  The 40 minute or so hike was on a flat and well-marked path.  The last 5 minutes involved a bit of a climb - but nothing too bad.  The only thing that we failed to properly prepare for was weather - which, on the hike back, was fairly bad.  However this didn’t take anything away from our enjoyment of what was a really spectacular experience."
Inside the volcano ,The best trip..guides are great and the place is beautiful. Very professional. It is a must when you visit Iceland
Inside the Volcano 2019,It was an amazing experience! Perfectly organised by an amazing staff. Thanks to the Inside the Volcano Team!
"EXPENSIVE, but so worth it!","2 days before visiting Iceland we realized we didn't have a plan for Day 1 so I recalled hearing about the Inside the Volcano experience and booked it.  Expensive (over $300/person) but worth it!Google Maps would have gotten us lost (coming from Grindavik), you really do have to take the route near Reykjavik and then head down 417 from 1 (or put Bláfjöll in your GPS as they start at the ski resort) to the site.  Or you can use their city pickup option.Good pre-hike briefing in the ski lodge.  If weather is dry hiking boots are not needed, we used sneakers with good tread but nothing special.  Meetup place has hot and cold beverages and very light snacks available.  Bring a bottle of waterThe walk to the volcano is 45 minutes long.  Ours was cool and windy so bring something to protect face/ears from the wind.  Most of it is flat over an easy path, the last 10 minutes is straight up the side of the volcano.  This is after you stop at their onsite base camp at the volcano, where you get a helmet with a light, and a harness for safety during the descent.  Tour is limited to 20-24 people or so.Once up top they have already divided you into groups no larger than 8 people, and your group goes down in the open elevator (think: Strong window washer lift), that you are harnessed to.  Once down you have 25-30 minutes or so to look around. Inside is rough floored with rock piles and it's dark so you have to be cautious when moving.  Then they take you back up.  Groups overlap so by the time you go up the rest of your gang is down there, if you are Group 1 you will be first back up.   Guides are well informed and quite careful of the visitors.  There is a bathroom at basecamp (and at the meetup spot) and they have lamb or vegan stew after the visit to warm you up.If you self-drove they seem to put you in group 1 and when you are done you can walk back to the meet up spot and your car on your own if you don't want to wait.  The path is super easy to follow so we took advantage of this option.The pace of the walk is quick.  There is a ""trailing guide"" to make sure no one gets left behind, but if you can't walk 1.25 miles or so on rough terrain in 35-40 minutes this might not be for you"
Amazing Trip to the Center of The Earth,"Heard about this excursion called Inside the Volcano. Sounded exciting so I signed up. They were very helpful with my last minute decision to go. It was my wife’s special birthday, which was the reason for our trip to Iceland in the first place. She was not in the mood for a 2 mile hike to get to the volcano and even less excited about going down into one. Some people are just more adventurous than others. She insisted that I go without her and that is one of the things I love about her. The trip was absolutely fantastic!! Maybe not for everybody, though. For those interested but a bit squeamish the staff is wonderful. Very safety conscious as well as fun to be with. They provide additional weather protection if you don’t bring your own. The two mile hike to the volcano was not bad at all. Very interesting looking at the volcanic rocks and caves along the way. With the guide giving us history and explaining what we were looking at. At the base camp we were given detailed instructions on what to expect, given helmets and fitted with a harness. Very safety conscious! When we got up to the volcano we were hooked up as we walked across a short, very safe and sturdy metal bridge and then hooked up when we got to the elevator device that takes you down. I can’t begin to describe the excitement going down into the volcano and the view and experience from the bottom looking up. The vastness, the rocks, the crevices and the various colors caused by the different minerals were mouth dropping. We got about a half an hour at the bottom of the volcano itself. The ride down and up was exciting in and of itself. This was a fantastic experience. Afterwards we got to the base camp where they served us traditional Icelandic meat soup or vegetable soup and coffee tea or hot chocolate to get us warmed up and ready for the 2 mile hike back to the parking lot. If you like to hike and you like exciting experiences you MUST put this on your list.   A special shout out to all of the guides and staff who couldn’t have been friendlier more knowledgeable,or more helpful. Watching them interact with their  wild little friend was an added treat. All I can say is WOW!!! Just do it!"
"Over rated, over priced, underwhelmed","5 hours, 6 kilometers rainy chilling hike and $800 dollars later, my wife and I concluded this was an experience better skipped.  On the plus side, descending into the core of a volcano is a totally unique experience and the staff is exceedingly nice.  But, given the time, exorbitant cost and low level depth of geology insight and education it is a poor use of time and money.  Essentially you spend the better part of 4 hours on site waiting and walking for a 5 minute decent and accent into the chamber and 15 minutes waking in a circle no more than 100 meters in length at the bottom.  Add the transit from Reykjavík it’s a 5-6 hour trip for a 25 minute experience.  Many better choices in Iceland."
Excellent Experience,It was just incredible..Doug and Brendiss were fantastic ..The whole staff was great..A must do in Iceland..
"An epic, unique experience!","A unique experience to go deep into the earth and explore the chamber of a volcano.  I debated doing this tour for some time and eventually booked it!  It was without doubt, one of the highlights of this beautiful country.  The walk to the volcano is very flat and manageable and we had a diverse group (Age 25-65) who coped well.  The owner-managed team are passionate, friendly and knowledgeable."
Worth It,Everything from the hotel pick-up to the return the hotel was perfect. On the walk to the volcano  the guide provided us with interesting information. The descent and time in the volcano was truly a unique experience. The generous hospitality provided on both ends of the tour helped keep us warm.
One of a kind experience with amazing sights!,"My husband and I, both in our 50s, signed up for the Inside the Volcano tour. The entire process was very well organized and we enjoyed our guides, Einar and Jasmin as well as the team at the cabin on the mountain.The price covers pick up and drop off from Reykjavík or you can just meet like we did at the meeting point which was very easy to find...one turn off the ring road.There’s a significant hike to the volcano that was about an hour each way. Make sure you prepare for rain and wear your hiking shoes.It was mostly a flat pathway to walk until you got to the mountain itself and then there was a bunch of steps but nothing that was a huge deal...even if you’re not in the greatest of shape like myself.The team gets you suited up and they are very safety conscious and you walk into what is essentially in open window washers cage and you get lowered about 350 feet down. There was no sense of fear whatsoever.The views are amazing and the photos don’t really do it any justice! It was almost a spiritual experience like being in nature’s Cathedral.  At the bottom, you can just sit and look around or you can take a 10-15 walk around the inside perimeter path that is a bit dark and uneven with slanted rocks. I was glad I brought my hiking sticks with me for balance and stability.At the end, you were offered some delicious vegetable soup with or without meat. Then you walk the hour back.I really love this company and thought this was a great excursion. However, to keep it honest, we thought it was a little too pricey for what we got... particularly since there is no price difference whether you take the round-trip transportation provided or not.  We joked that for approximately $880 for the two of us, they should have a cable car or a zip line take us all the way back to the meeting point rather than having to hike another hour.All of that being said, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime doing opportunity and if money is not tight, I would definitely recommend it and thank the Inside the Volcano team for an excellent job!"
Amazing experience,What a great experience! The hike through the desolate volcanic rock landscape was invigorating.  The trip in and out of the volcano was amazing.   The variety of colors inside the volcano was surprising.    It was expensive but where else can you do something like this?
Incredible experience,"This really is an experience unlike any other - you get to go into an actual volcano!  Every aspect of this tour was well managed.  The company will lend out raincoats if you need them, and they're long ones to help protect your pants from any rain, which I thought was a great idea.  The guides are pretty relaxed on the trail, allowing people to go at their own pace without the fear of getting lost, as it's a very easily visible trail.  The descent into the volcano is thrilling, then the view once inside is absolutely awe-inspiring.  There's no way to describe it, you need to see it for yourself!"
Awesome,We took the volcano tour on September 10. It is awesome and definitely a must do. The walk to the volcano was pretty flat and easy to do. The trip down in the volcano was breathtaking! The colors and just being in a volcano was excellent. The guides were really nice and explained all about the inside. The soup was good and good way to end the tour. The first all back was harder due to wind but u can’t control that. I would say u have to do this tour!
Spectacular and very well organized,"This is an absolute must if you visit Iceland, the trip itself into the volcano is something you can not see or experience anywhere else, and has to be experienced first hand. The trip itself is also very well organized, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the soup at the end is such a perfect conclusion."
Fabulous tour in and out of the Volcano 🌋,It was a great experience! The Volcano is something awesome but if you can be inside is this kind of experience you’ll never forget! A big thanks for Helga in the office. She can help you with whatever you need!Adda and Margret are the best tour guides. They fit in this fabulous experience perfectly! They’ll reply all your questions 😉Also the base camp near the Volcano is fantastic. It has the whole commodities you need plus a great team there who’s gonna share with you their delicious soup 🍲Do not miss it! Unforgettable time 👌🏾
AMAZING!,"The dormant Thrihnukagigur volcano is truly unique, and opens the gates to a surreal atmosphere. It is incredible to descend inside and see the path of the magma. The colors are amazing!The price of the excursion is high..but I can tell you that it is worth every penny! You will not regret it!Bonus: nice, warm soup, after the visit. Great pleasure if the day was cold and windy and wet, as when I went."
Once In A Lifetime Adventure,There is nothing else like this in the world! Nowhere else can you be lowered literally into the center of the earth inside an inactive volcano situated in the middle of an enormous lava field. Just a really cool experience. A must do for the soul looking for adventure in Reykjavik Iceland!
An experience you will not get anywhere else,"I got hooked on this tour much before I went to Iceland. I decided to go with my wife, disregarding the price which is quite high. We had a timely pick up on the bus stop in front of our hotel and then moved to another bus after entire group was collected. A short ride fro Reykjavik and you get to the main base. We were given basic instructions, bandana (as a gift - I do not know whether it was due to extremely bad weather or is it a usual gesture) and offered rubber raincoats. As weather was extremely bad that day (or the later groups were cancelled) it was great as whatever we wore was not enough. A walk from the main base to base camp takes some 45 minutes, following the path over the lunar scape. As essentially there are no other paths or roads, a reasonable careful person cannot get lost, however full attention was paid that we gave a front person to lead and a back person to monitor the whole group. it is not exhausting walk or drastic climbing, few very moderate up hill and down hill sections, but nasty weather with heavy rain and wind made it quite tough. Once at the base camp, we were offered hot drinks, had some rest while we were waiting for our turn, got the gear and instructions and continued to the top of the volcano. This is 3 to 5 minutes of climbing, somewhat steeper but strong wind and metal bars positioned on the path which would be helpful on a dry weather but on rain were slippery made it not an easy task. An elevator takes you deep into the volcano with its walls nicely lit to reveal beauty of geology and colours of different minerals. We had some 30 minutes down, and you can make a round through the path, which however is not easy to walk as basically it is marked but the ground is original, being it rocks, smaller stones or whatever. Thus very good walking shoes with heavy soles are absolute must.  Climb up by the elevator, walk dawn the volcano and we were rewarded by icelandic meat soup (vegetable one is also offered) to warm up. Base camp also has a small souvenir shop and I guess T shirt I was in the Volcano you only can get here and nowhere else in the world. Another 45 minutes walk back to the main camp again would present no problem at all if it was not for a heavy wind which was hitting us with iced raindrops (however, rain was not that strong any more). If it was not for a very bad weather this would be even a pleasant and not demanding experience, overall duration is not that long. Pricey, yes, but a unique experience."
Amazing experience!,"This place is truly amazing and once in a life time experience though in my case it is the second time I visit. The second time was even better! It is a jaw dropping place and you will get blown away by the volcano beauty. I mean where else in the world can you go inside a volcano! Invited my boyfriend there for his birthday and he loved every moment of it too! The staff was amazing, everybody in good mood and really helpful with everything! Would recommend this to everybody!"
Once in a Lifetime Experience,"The walk to and from the volcanoes was a bit longer and more difficult than I expected - perhaps it was the quick pace that made it a tad difficult.  Certainly doable but be prepared for a rocky path where you can stub your foot.  Once there they explain everything in an orientation while you suit up with your harness and helmet and climb the short path to the top.  It is a 6 minute lift ride down inside, which is a long way.  The interior is phenomenal in color and formation.  The walk around the perimeter is also difficult which requires balance - part of the way I was crawling almost on my hands and knees as the ""path"" is only a lighted climb over lava and rocks.  Still worth the visit, just know what you are getting into."
Nice tour but a bit pricey for what you get,"The activity itself is very enjoyable and the staff is great. The area is beautiful and the interior of the volcano is amazing.  If the price were a bit lower, it'd easily be a five star experience but, compared to other activities on our trip, this one was a bit pricey for what is included.The tour boils down to a scenic, fairly easy 40 minute walk from the meeting point to the volcano base camp where you are given a brief orientation.   From there its a short hike up to the mouth of the volcano where the lift takes you down.  Inside the volcano there is an intro to the interior and you are left alone for about 20 minutes to walk a loop around the perimeter.  After that, its back up the lift, down to base camp for refreshments and then you are on your own to stroll back to the meeting point."
The trip is amazing,"It the best tour I have been so far, the volcano is amazing! Even it was raining but it still worth it!"
Best part of the whole trip!,"Being from Missouri, I am a cave nerd and love stuff like this. This experience was the best tour of the whole trip, and we enjoyed every day of our visit to Iceland. We had a gorgeous day for the 30 minute easy hike to the volcano; it is only steep at the end. The hike there and back is really neat to enjoy the views of the surrounding area. We did dress in layers as suggested. There are several great aspects of this tour - it is very peaceful and there are not thousands of tourists here - they only allow about 6 people going down in a lift, and so there are maybe a few groups wandering around but the whole thing is a more private experience and not so commercialized. We were the third group to go down, so we amused ourselves by watching a two month old arctic fox wander around camp that had taken up residence. Afterwards, you have choices of soup; we had the vegetable which was delicious. The shuttle that takes you back to your drop off point was comfortable and on time. This is the only place in the world that you can go inside a dormant volcano and see the history. It was truly amazing to actually be hundreds of feet down and walk around. They provide a harness and helmet with a light for better viewing. Highly recommend - where else can you do this?"
One of the best sites anywhere in the world,"This is a totally unique experience and I would highly recommend. The hike to the volcano isn’t difficult...it’s primarily a flat gravel path. You should definitely wear sturdy shoes and a wind-resistant jacket & gloves — other than that, you’ll be fine. The hike to/from and the scenery all around is nearly as enjoyable as the volcano experience itself. This is a very well run tour. We got picked up directly at our hotel and everything from the hike in, directions at the base camp, info from the guide inside the volcano, lunch afterward, etc. were top notch. It’s an expensive day - but one I’d do again in a heartbeat. I’ve traveled all over the world and done everything from the bridge climb in Sydney to hiking Machu Picchu. This day was up near the top of most memorable experiences!"
Amazing trip inside the volcano,"This trip is really amazing, app. 40 minutes away from Reyklavik we visited the inside of a volcano. Its an experience that we will remember forever. Bring good and warm clothing - you have to walk 45 min each direction and we spent 40 min in the volcano. Very expensive (44.000 ISK for each adult and kid but worth every cent!!!)"
It’s a volcano,AMAZING!! T our guide was excellent and very knowledgeable about the region and volcanos! We drove to the meeting point where they had hot drinks and cookies for us while we waited for the whole group to show up! We then walked for about 45min to base camp. It was a quick but leisurely walk when 3 stops on the way so that T could talk to us as a group regarding the area or volcanos in general. Once we got to basecamp we were again given drinks and given safety instructions on the hardware being used. The scaffold that was used to lower us into the volcano was sturdy and felt safe. We were strapped onto the scaffold which gave me peace of mind that I could lean over and not be totally afraid of falling over. The volcano had so many vibrant colors and was huge! We got to explore the area and take photos for about 30min which surprisingly is enough time! Once we got back to the top of the volcano we went back to base camp where they had soup and drinks for us! The soup is GREAT! It was Icelandic lamb soup I believe and yea it hit the spot! Then we walked back to the meeting point. I would recommend this adventure to anyone who likes these types of things or wants to have a unique experience. The facilities and the staff were all great and very nice.
Incredible experience ,"This was one of the highlights of our 15-day trip around Iceland.  Unique, hugely interesting, mind-blowing and exciting day out.Without doubt the best tour operators we experienced.  They were easy-going, friendly and informative.  Good fun and created a nice atmosphere.The volcano itself was just extraordinary.  The colours and shapes incredible.  Both our daughters (aged 5 & 8) loved it too.  Climbing over rocks, the lift down and added bonus of lava tunnels to explore on the way back."
Unique once in a lifetime experience ,"Wow. Just wow. Such a unique opportunity, only place in the world you can enter inside a volcano like this and it was just a stroke of luck you even can. They will explain all about this on the day. You ride over and then hike for about 45 minutes across a lava field before reaching the volcano. You then go on the lift in small groups for a 6/7 ride in a lift down to the magma chamber. I had heard about the array of colours from reviews but honestly, they were absolutely breathtaking. Our guide was incredible and very knowledgeable. She knew her stuff and was very passionate eager to answer any questions. You then get to explore around the chamber. It can be a bit tricky on the rocks so make sure you are wearing suitable shoes. If you're as lucky as us you'll even get to soy and Arctic Fox! Loved it and will never forget the experience. Thanks!"
Favorite part of our family trip to Iceland,"We scheduled this at the last minute after reading about it in a magazine during our trip, and it ended up being the favorite part of our trip. The hike was beautiful, and not at all hard for my family (ages 13 to 63 - and not all hikers at heart). The outbound hike was brisk and fun. The return hike can be done at your own pace, and we were able to take our own sweet time and enjoy the scenery/take photos.  Absolutely breathtaking area, and being able to walk through this wide open expanse with volcanoes in the background was marvelous.  The volcano itself was incredible - you can actually see where the earth split and came back together inside the magma chamber.  Can touch the wall of the chamber and explore a bit inside.  So cool to think the lift was initially put in by National Geographic to film this special place. The people running the excursion were as nice as can be.  This makes such a huge difference as to whether the activity is just good or really really special.  The base camp was such an oasis of relaxation, good conversation, and incredible soup (best lamb soup we had, compared to several restaurants).  We saw the arctic fox pup, too, which my kids were thrilled about!  Worth every penny.  When you get home, you won't be thinking about the price but about the wonderful experience and memories you have forever.  Would love to do this again if we return to Iceland.  Thank you to all for a wonderful time!"
CHECK THE WEATHER FIRST!!!,If you are prepared to walk for around 2 hours in 50+ MPH wind/rain then this is your place. Otherwise best to avoid going here when the weather isn’t good. Even in good weather it is a long trip for 30 minutes inside and price is a bit outrageous. Only 7 people can enter the volcano at a time so everyone else in the group needs to wait. It is definitely a unique experience but only under the right conditions.
Very Different and Wonderful (Except for High Winds!),Hike to the volcano was rather high pace; could have been a tad slower to be enjoyable. Staff at Volcano location were very good and helpful.  Descent into the volcano was exciting.   Walking around on the base floor was fun but be prepared for some wet slippery rocks and some clamboring over rocks.  Colors were much varied and pretty to photograph.  Time at bottom (about 45 mins) was adequate.  Wind at top of volcano was somewhat frightening; almost all one could do to stand up!!  Also hike back to meeting place was tough considering we were walking into 30-40 mph headwinds.  We VERY GLAD is was not also raining!!!   Would recommend to anyone who likes to do something very different!!
Amazing experience!,"It's a great experience! Worth every money. The crew is well prepered, makes you feel save the hole time, explaining some interesting facts about the vulcano and watching over your safety. They really nice and helpfull on every point of your journey. I recommend to wear good hiking boots and comfortable cargopants, couse they'll come handy down there. I definitely encourage everybody who's hesitate about taking the tour to: Do It! Experience for lifetime! Thank you again!"
Nice visiting of the inside of the volcano,Except the pick up service which send us an email saying the pick up point was in front of our hotel Reykjavik city hotel but it was wrong. And we had to go by ourselves by car at inside the volcano meeting point the rest was perfect. All inside the volcano guides and staff were very pro and kind. Thank you.
Once in a lifetime,"It was an amazing experience from start to finish.  Started the tour at the base camp where the guide tells you what to expect for the day.  Make a long (45 min) hike with stops and highlights (lava fields, lava tube, tectonic plates, craters, etc.) along the way to the base of the volcano.  There we were given more instructions and safety equipment.  We met their arctic fox mascot-so cute!  Finally it was time to walk the short distance to the top and board the lift down inside the volcano.  I am afraid of heights and was nervous about doing this except the rest of my group was excited and surprisingly I was fine.  I felt very safe strapped both on the short bridge to the lift and inside the lift.  And as soon as we started descending - which was a very smooth trip - I was so mesmerized by all the colors that I forgot to be scared.  Inside the volcano it was magical.  All the colors and just the science behind how it is still standing and how it was found is just amazing.  Had a chance to walk around and take lots of pictures.  Headed back up and back to the volcano camp for some absolutely delicious soup before heading back on the hike to the base camp.  My family of young adults and older teens absolutely loved this.  All the guides and house managers were friendly and helpful.  Everyone who worked there was knowledgable and seemed to really enjoy the work."
Fantastic,"Such a unique experience. Don't miss it! It's a trek to get to the volcano, and on the day we went, it was extremely windy. Be sure to bring a backpack so you're prepared for any unforeseen weather. Though the temperature was lower inside the volcano, it was actually quite nice inside (no wind!)."
Amazing unique experience,"My husband, 23-year old daughter, 18-year old son and I just returned from a trip to Iceland where we traveled along the entire Ring Road. Our trip inside the volcano was a clear highlight of our trip despite 50-mile-per-hour winds on our way to and from the volcano.  Where else in the world can you experience descending into a magma chamber of a volcano that erupted 5,000 years ago? The guides are knowledgeable and welcoming. The soup at the base camp hit the spot on a chilly and windy day!"
A unique and unmissed experience,"Take a walk in time from 5,000 years to 50,000 years and discover the effects of volcanic activity. This of course is present throughout the whole island of Iceland. However, each region seems to hold a unique characteristic of volcanic activity from volcanic cliffs to deep ravene-like structures. After a fairly easy walk, but about 45mins long, you arrive to the remains of a 🌋 that has been resting for 50,000 years. Through careful and precise engineering, you will be guided to a hydraulic lift that carries you deep inside the volcano to reveal an amazing spectacle of color, and everlasting effects of what once was an erupting volcano. A truly unique experience."
only one in the world,"Amazing visit to the inside of a volcano. The only one n the world that is not a little lake at the bottom of a crater. the walk to the volcano is 2 miles not a difficult walk through the lava fields. The descent through the opening is amazing to see the walls up which the lava flowed. inside the volcano there is path you can walk around and see the walls and colors.At the base camp there is a rescue arctic fox one of the very few signs of wildlife in iceland other that birds, sheep and livestock.At the basecamp they serve up soup lamb soup and a vegan option that is very tasty warm and freshly prepared.the guides are friendly and well versed in the history and geology."
Repeat?,I would like to go back immediately and often.  There are two things that need to be done during a visit of iceland: Blue Lagoon and Inside the Volcano.  Every aspect of the Country is awesome but these two places can not be fully described.
One of the Most Exceptional Experiences Out There,"I have been fortunate to  travel to nearly 170 countries and came back to Iceland a second time just to experience this as it is the only place in the world you can go inside a volcano.I'm so glad I did!The transfer from Reykjavik went smoothly and our guide was very kind and explained interesting facts about the volcano. We had time upon arrival at the base hut to put on our layers (its 3 C inside the volcano and gets windy and cold while you hike to the volcano too) and have a cup of coffee or tea. You can borrow a rain poncho there if it  raining. Then we had  brisk 45 minute flat walk to the volcano hut. (Minimum age is usually 12, but if a child can walk well they allow them to participate. My ten year old nephew flew across the path, but he is used to hiking up mountains.) You get a briefing before taking a window cleaner's lift down into the volcano.The thirty minutes inside the volcano is stunning. You get to walk around and appreciate the majesty and also just sit still and take in the beauty and colors. You get to see two other lifts going in and out during your time inside the volcano which makes for dramatic photos.After that, you get a delicious bowl of traditional Icelandic lamb or vegetable soup, while you wait for the rest of your group. (Note: they try and have people who drove directly to the base camp in the first group so that they can leave first as they don't need to wait for a bus back. You don't need to be in a group to walk back to the base camp.)We were picked up at 7 AM and back at 1 PM. How many people can say that before lunch they were inside a volcano? A truly mind blowing experience for young and old. Highly recommended."
I dare you to forget this experience,"After having heard that this was an amazing experience, my expectations were high and I was not disappointed. The guides were friendly and very knowledgeable. The event was not crowded. The basecamp facility was clean and spacious, and the event itself was amazing. I'm glad I went!"
A must do when visiting Iceland!,"The guides to and from the volcano were very accommodating to walkers of all skill levels. The base camp was great to warm back up and grab some tasty soup. The guides were helpful, equipment well maintained, and the scenery amazing at every turn."
Nice Hike + Great Experience,We enjoyed a nice hike to a set of small buildings that kept us warm while we awaiting the volcano experience.    We were giving plenty of time inside the volcano and when finished provided warm accommodations as well as yummy soup to power ourselves up for the trek back.   Everyone there was extremely nice and we highly recommend this experience.
What a Blast! ,This is a unique tour that is really fun and interesting. The cavern inside the volcano is stunningly beautiful as is the scenery on the hike in. But the tour does require some physical stamina and mobility. The hike is about 4 miles round trip along a gravel path. Down in the cavern there is a circular path that involves a lot of ups and downs over wet rocks. There are rope hand holds. And if you don't want to walk the path the view when you get off the elevator is fantastic and worth the price of the tour.
Excellent place,"It's a slightly difficult trek to the Þríhnúkagígur volcano . It is just amazing going down to the magma chamber. Also went through the lava tunnels. it's  a dormant volcano and it last erupted over 4,000 years ago. Volcanic passages continue down to a depth of about 200 to 700mThe beauty of the crater is the various colours found inside it, and its enormous and intimidating size. The space inside is amazing.  One takes a lift down to go to the magma chamber, this was first constructed by National Geographic about 10 years ago. Now we have the better version which is safe and sturdy. A must visit for those who go to Iceland."
One of a kind,"Driving around we stomped into this place. At the top of a mountain, next to a sky resort. A good hike to the base camp. Then the ride down an elevator into the belly of a death volcano.Very interesting and out of the ordinary. And then the soup. Lamb and vegetables or just vegetable soup. The entire staff was very informative and helpful. Lava tunnels are find, getting into the gigantic fireplace is another thing. And the soup... ahh.The three peak volcano. Worth the trip."
Family trip,Just amazing - very friendly and competent staff. The soups after the tour are amazing. Definitely one of the best things you actually can do on Iceland.
Unlike anything else!,"This was truly a one of a kind experience! Hiking across lava fields to base camp, gearing up in safety equipment there before ascending the volcano (to stunning views of Reykjavik in the not-so-very-distance), walking across a narrow catwalk over the gaping mouth of the huge cavern below, and then descending in an open scaffold to the floor of the empty lava chamber...THRILLING! The staff are tremendously friendly and informative, and safety is very much a priority. The base camp is remarkably comfortable, with complimentary coffee, tea and water. The post-caving soup was delicious.It does require a bit of physical agility, between the hike to and from the volcano (mostly flat), to scrambling over rocks and stones on the cavern floor. We lucked out with weather (it was clear, cool and not windy), but I imagine the hike can be pretty brutal in less-than-ideal conditions. I would also recommend going early...we were one of the first groups of the day, so base camp was empty when we arrived, but it was filling up and getting crowded as we left.Oh, did I mention meeting Ima, the arctic fox pup?"
Must do for any visit,"Amazing experience! It's a 5-6 hour commitment, which includes ~35min bus ride to site from hotel, 3K walk from drop point to volcano, and the a short walk to the lift that lowers you in. Get about 30-40 min to hang out inside a volcano."
Great Experience ,"We loved inside the volcano. Our guides were knowledgeable and helpful Snd friendly. Yes, we had wonderful August weather and also really enjoyed the hike. This was a great trip. How often can you descend down a volcano ? I highly recommend this trip."
Once in a lifetime experience!,"Inside The Volcano is an amazing, not to be missed experience! The hike on the lava field to get to the volcano was so peaceful and surreal (suggest wearing hiking boots and warm clothing). The tour was very well organized (including pick-up and drop-off in Reykjavik), and the guides were super-friendly and knowledgeable. They also emphasized safety at all times. The base camp was very comfortable and welcoming too. So glad that we spent the money on this unique experience!"
Inside the colcano,"A very well organized tour. Lovely, friendly, knowledgeable, funny staff. Thanks for the tour and also the buff which we used for the entire trip around Iceland."
Expensive. Totally worth it.,"Definitely a great experience. Actually, a combination of experiences - your 30 minutes inside the volcano is the crux of of several good hours. The drive to the base camp can be unpleasant inside a cramped minibus, but scenery is great. Then, it's a great hike through wild volcanic scenery to the volcano. Inside the volcano is fantastic, but it isn't for the timid. It's not like they've put in paths and stairs down there (thank goodness), it's wet rocks and a bit of rope handrail to steady yourself. That might worry some people, but it enhanced the experience for me. If you don't like the sound of that, you don't have to walk around, you can just stand in the centre and look about you. Once out of the volcano again, there's still plenty to do. You can walk around the local area, make friends with an arctic fox cub (not kidding, and she's soooo cute), and eat your bowl of traditional lamb soup. Then walk back to base camp - another great hike. The only problem was that I had only about 30 minutes inside the volcano. I'd have preferred a bit longer."
Excellent Experience,"The hike was token about 45min, and then we had a very nice rest time with a baby fox and coffee, water...;) The inside the volcano tour was very impressive, thanks the explanation we had learned a lot of histories and theories of volcano and the color, how it happened. After tour we had a super tasty soup!!!!!!! SUPER DELICIOUS!!! :) I will not stop trying to make it by my-selves."
Must see,"it is expensive BUT every cent is good invested. The tour is well organized, you get a soup after the visite of the vulcano (temperature 4 grad celsius) and at this time you can observe the young artic fox which is living at the base camp."
SOOOO worth the time and money!,"While the hike is moderate and at times steep, it is worth it!  The lift ride down is awe-inspiring and the inside of the volcano is a unique experience!  The scale of the place is mind boggling.  Yes, it is pricey, but the guides are great, the safety is taken very seriously, and the soup after the hike is DELICIOUS!"
This volcanic adventure totally rocked !,"Iceland is a MUST on anyone’s bucket list of places to visit !! The raw beauty of the country and the multitude of awesome excursions is endless .One of many fabulous adventures that we experienced was “Inside the Volcano 🌋 “ .After a brief orientation by a local guide you will venture out on a 45 minute hike to a base camp where you will get fitted with harnesses and helmets to then hike another 10 minutes up to the mouth of the volcano .You are then lowered , by an automated lift , to 400 feet below to the dormant volcano’s floor . Neither words nor photos can describe the magic below !!-it’s just one of those “ you have to see it to believe it “ experiences .The staff and guides were fabulous and so knowledgeable about everything related to this outing . It books up quick as there are limited spaces and excursions each day .Don’t risk missing out on this epic experience ,book well in advance of your trip. You won’t regret it !!A HOT top on an Icelandic experience !!!"
Amazing Experience,"Special metion for Dirk our very experienced guide, thnk you for a brilliant day. Descending over 120M in a window cleaning cradle to the base of a volcano is a totally unique and slightly nerve racking experience.  The lighting at the bottom of the crater is amazing.  Explanation from our guide on how the crater formed.  Wait in base camp cabin at the foot of the crater to go in small groups  of up to 6.  Hot soup + chance to chat with the organisors. 10/10"
Spectacular,"It is well worth the hike to this jewel in Iceland.  It is a short distance from the city.  The guides are friendly, and they answered every question I asked about the area.  The groups are small, with fewer than 15 visitors at the bottom at any given time.  The orphaned Arctic fix at the guides' base camp was an added bonus.  I can't wait to take my wife there the next time we are in the country."
Once in a lifetime experience!,"Ever thought you could go INSIDE a volcano? Yeah, me neither. Well, turns out that Iceland is the place to do just that. Inside the Volcano runs a really amazing tour to a beautiful and unique spot that really showcases their country. The tour guides are very knowledgeable (and good at singing!) and friendly. Definitely worth the trip (and the money), plus you get to say that you were inside the empty magma chamber of a dormant volcano. How cool is THAT!"
Extraordinary trip inside a volcano,"This is one of the best unique trip inside a 4,500 year volcano.The combination of beautiful colorful rock and cold atmosphere make you speechless.I recommend it strongly."
You don't want to miss this.,"Very well organized, professionaly presented, friendly, educated guides. Inside stories and a little fox added up to the experience."
Amazing experience,"We did the combo tour in helicopter:  Inside the volcano and the glacier tour.  One of the best experiences in our life.  IT IS NOT CHEAP,  but AMAZING!!! Highly recomended"
Inside the Volcano- wonderful tour!,This was a once-in-a-lifetime tour! The facilities at the parking lot and base camp were very well apportioned. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The soup after the tour was delicious! Being inside the volcano was an out-of-this-world experience!
Wonderful and Unique,"Very unique. The guides are helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. It is expensive but worth it. We drove ourselves. That helped us to save a lot of time, we were there for 3.5 hours in total. If you take the free bus ride, it will unnecessary consume the better part of a day."
Amazing experience,This event was one of a kind. All of the guides were very knowledge about the volcano and surrounding area. The inside of the volcano was so neat. The inside of the volcano is a little chilly so be sure to have a jacket and pants. The 40 minute walk to the volcano is very scenic!
Unforgettable from my mind and walet,"It was truly an amazing experience, not gonna lie. Amazing, unique, one of those things you see people do and you think “wow, I wish I could do that!”. You have to walk 3km (but don't worry, the guide will go at whatever pace you wish) until basecamp, where lovely Icelandic people meet you with coffee and/or tea and cookies. Then you descend in a very tiny elevator into a VOLCANO. yes, it´s as amazing as it sounds and, unlike people think, it does not reek of sulfur. Highly recommend, however it is expensive. If you pay for it, you won't regret it but you need to be okay with what you are paying."
Amazing experience,"Must be visit once in your life ! Great experience , nice and helpful staffs ! No compliant at all !"
"Great trip, one of the best experiences I had","We have done this tour together with my 18 years old daughter! An absolutely amazing trip and a must to do if you are heading to Iceland. Very well organised, you don’t have to think about anything. You will be well looked after from the minute you will be picked up till the drop off. The guides are very friendly and very knowledgeable. That’s one of a kind tour, you won’t have this experience anywhere in the world. This tour will take your breath away!!"
Inside a volcano for a high price,Ok this is a once in a lifetime experience. First you have to walk some 3 km to reach the socalled basecamp. Lot of attention to safety . it was a nice descent but honestly price too high. Afterwards soup.
Truely an AMAZING experience!,"This was definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Iceland! It was so much more than expected. It was a long hike to the volcano - to base camp. The story of the experience was unbelievable and it was cool to meet the family of the original discoverers. The team was very passionate, endearing and fun to be around. They were prepared and made sure that the experience was fun and safe. The inside of the volcano is unbelievable - you have to see if for yourself! And the lamb stew at the end made us feel like real explorers."
Down in a Hole,"The ride down for me wasn't that great (not good with heights), but roaming in the pit of the volcano was so cool.  Our guide telling us about the formations, the colors of the rock, the fissure, and looking upward was a unique experience.  We were treated to lamb stew afterwards."
Þríhnúkagígur: Outstanding!,"After a nine-day tour of Iceland (basalt everywhere!), my wife and I went to Þríhnúkagígur. The weather that day was lovely, so the 2-km hike to the vent was a delight, with spectacular views. Knowledgeable staff who are über-friendly made the walks a pleasure. The trip into Þríhnúkagígur was spectacular, frankly. It's not just the descent, which is really cool; it's not just the colors; it's the flow structures and volcanic drainage system on display, too, that make it fascinating. Yes, the experience is a bit pricey; nevertheless, it is distinctly worth it. (And the post-volcano soup is wonderful.) Highly recommended."
Inside the volcano tour,This is an amazing experience. Fascinating and unique for everyone regardless of whether you are interested in the geology. The colours are beautiful and the huge chamber makes one feel very small. Was amazed how clean and pure the air was within the chamber. The staff were all fantastic and if I had the chance I would do it again.
Just amazing!,"This is by far my favorite islandic tour. The 7mn way down into the volcano leaves you breathless just watching at the incredible beauty of the lava formations, but that’s only the beginning and once you get to the bottom 450 feet below, you just realize the power of nature. The colors are incredible. A MUST DO."
A highlight of our trip!,"On our last day in Iceland, we took the Inside the Volcano tour.  They picked us up on time (930 am) and drove us about 30 minutes outside Reykjavik to a lodge.  From there, we hiked 1.25 miles to their base camp right next to the volcano opening.  They helped us put on the gear (helmet and harness), and then we hiked up another 0.25 miles to the volcano opening.  We felt completely safe on the lift as it lowered us down (one of our group was very concerned about getting on to the lift, and she had no problem with it).  when we got to the bottom inside the volcano, we couldn't believe what we saw.  the colors, size and landscape inside are unbelievable.  They give you plenty of time to explore and take pictures, and explain what you're seeing and the history.  It's pretty cold inside the volcano (30F / 0C), so you'll want to dress warm, and bring gloves and a hat.  Plus, wear something water resistant: the rocks inside can be wet and it can drip a little in some areas.  There's plenty of hiking on this tour, so it's not for people with mobility issues.  However, you don't need to be in great shape; the hiking is not particularly challenging.  It just may take you a little longer than some others to do the hiking.  After a week of seeing and doing some amazing things in Iceland, this was clearly the best experience we had.  don't miss it!"
"Amazing, once in a lifetime experience!","Where else can you enter an inactive volcano?  What an amazing experience this was!  For those of you considering it, I would definitely do it.  Please know, however, that the walk to and from the volcano can be a bit strenuous, though not horrible.  There is about a 2 mile hike through lava fields.  There is a path but it is a bit rocky and uneven, so those with mobility issues should not do this trip.  Once at the volcano, the walk around inside the cavern is also a bit difficult.  There are large boulders and rocks to walk over and around.  The guides were very nice and helpful.  We also enjoyed seeing a baby Icelandic Fox while there - almost as good as going into the volcano itself!"
Once in a life time,"A must see attraction if you are planning on going to Iceland. Truly amazing experience. Be prepared to deal with a 4 mile hike, round trip. The weather was fine on our tour day, so we were fine.I felt that the price is a bit on the high side."
"Beautiful, but really expensive!","The colours in the volcano where really bautiful, the organisation was good and the guides nice. But I must say, that the price was to high for the tour. I spent 30 minutes in the volcano. The cave ist not big.You can walk a little bit around, and thats it. Later you can eat a soup in the hat. The colours great. But I wouldn´t say that it is a Must-Have. You can see more from Iceland if you invest your money in other trips."
Incredible volcano - but drive yourself if possible,"The hike was easy and flat, with the exception of the last 10-ish minutes to the volcano. Inside the actual volcano was beautiful and colorful. The lamb stew afterwards was very good. There was also a vegetarian option. The guides were very nice and helpful.As others have mentioned the time inside the volcano is only 30 minutes. The hike is about 45 minutes each way. The rest of the time gearing up and waiting. If you can drive yourself that takes out the bulk of the wait time. We were able to drive ourselves and the entire tour from start to finish was about 3 and a half hours."
Inside of volcano - the experience like no other!,"Highly recommend to take this tour! It's ones in a lifetime experience.It's not cheap! and you will need to walk 4-5 miles in good pace. It's NOT a leisure walk by all means! It's a hike! and a 'work out'. If you are not in a good physical form, do not take this tour. Bonus - the best lamb soup I ever tasted in my life! Absolutely delicious! They gave it to us after we come back from the bottom of volcano to warm up our souls. And so it did!"
A Must Do!!,"Amazing experience and excellent service! The tour operator is great- right from arrival, waiting room entrainment, knowledgeable guides and outstanding service. This is totally worth it. This is very doable with young kids- my almost 7 years old and 8 years old finished the only way hike in 40 mins"
Incredible Experience!,"While there is a decent amount of hiking involved getting to the volcano, the sights and experience made it all worthwhile!"
Amazing time!,We had an amazing time! The volcano is just stunning and the colours down there... you gotta see it yourself to believe it's real!
Lifetime experience!,"The only place in the world where you can actually go inside the volcano. The tour was expensive but worth! I really enjoyed the tour, got the good weather on the day and had a nice walk to the volcano. The staff was professional and friendly, cooked the good Icelandic meat…"

Truly awe inspiring,"I have to admit, I was nervous at the prospect of being lowered deep into the crater of a volcano, but it was an absolutely incredible experience. The staff was wonderful , knowledgeable, and I felt safe the entire time. The interior of the volcano is like nothing I have ever…"
Spectacular!,"It was truly incredible to be lowered into this dormant volcano. This excursion is a little expensive, but worth the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Also note that you must hike about 2 miles (3 KM) to get to the base camp. And, the walk is not particularly easy since it is not…"
BEST EXPERIENCE- GREAT GUIDES.,"We were family of four and really enjoyed the trip to INSIDE the VOLCANO. Guides are extremely knowledgeable of the area. You have to be prepared to do a 6KM back and forth, not a tough hike, but some areas are hiking up the hill. Well established and coordinated trip.…"
expensive but worth,"professional and friendly team, wonderful walk to the volcano, unique experience inside the volcano, tasty soup :-)although price is really high I would recommend!"
Truly memorable experience,"This tour was an unforgettable highlight of our Iceland trip. Our group guide T (or Mr. T) was great; in addition to his knowledge, he provided a beautiful brief solo vocal concert in the volcano base. A wonderful contribution to the otherworldly spirituality of the whole experience. Everyone was friendly and approachable (the assistant guide; the lift operator; all the staff at the outpost at the base of the volcano). And, delicious lamb stew after the descent!"
Unique experience,So much fun!  We drove to the site with no problem.  Guides were helpful and informative - we felt safe the whole time.  Fun feeling like you are experiencing something few folks get to do!
Awesome experience ,"This is a fantastic experience. The guides are friendly, professional and full of knowledge about the volcano. A bit of a hike to get there but you get hot drinks before going into the volcano. Inside the volcano is really beautiful and interesting. You also get some hot drinks and hot soup before heading back to the office. Highly recommended."
Great tour!,"The Inside the Volcano tour was amazing. We had some last minute changes in travel plans and when we called to change our pick-up, relatively last minute, they were very kind and accommodating! The tour guides were very sweet and friendly. The provided a lot of information about the volcano. The hot soup and tea was a lovely touch after going inside the Volcano. It was efficiently run and well organized. Thanks!"
Once in a lifetime experience,"We went Inside the Volcano in July 2019 and had a fantastic experience. Pickup from our hotel at bus stop 13 was easy and hassle-free. Our lead guide, Jonas, was funny and very knowledgeable- we learned so much! All the guides and staff we interacted with were so friendly and helpful. I was worried the hike might be too challenging- it is about 40 minutes to the base camp, but 99% of it is flat hiking on terrain similar to gravel. The last 5 minutes or so, you do climb a decent incline, but I did not think it was too bad at all (considering you are going to the top of a volcano!). We got very lucky with beautiful weather, but our guide said this is the rainiest region in Iceland, so definitely pack waterproof outerwear and layers. Soup and coffee at the cabin after the tour was fantastic and of course, the time in the volcano itself was unbelievable. I was worried that 30 minutes inside was not going to feel like enough time, but honestly, it was more than enough to hike around and even sit for a bit and chat with the guide before going back up. Yes, this tour is expensive, but this is an experience you cannot get anywhere else in the world and would do it all over again in a heartbeat!"
Unique in the world,"This is one of the must do once experiences in your lifetime. From the transport, guidance to the incredible experience of being in such a magnificent environment below the ground. Guide was really nice and knowledgeable, and those colours inside the volcano, its a thing that is impossible to describe. 10/10 experience."
Fantastic experience!,"This experience started by being picked up at our accommodation in Reykjavík. From there we were taken to the meeting point to meet our lead guide. The hike is 3 1/2km to the volcano and takes about 45 minutes. The guide stopped about 3 times to explain and show the group different features in the landscape. Upon arrival at base camp we were given a safety briefing and our safety equipment. The descent is in an open cage lift. This was amazing as we saw the different formations and colours as we slowly descended into the magma chamber. It is breathtaking as you stand on the floor of this volcano and try to take in what you see. It’s a one off experience as you explore the area for about 40 minutes. The walls of the chamber are a rainbow of colours. The sheer size of the volcano is impressive. On the way back up, if you look down, the people are so small they look like ants. Back at the opening of the volcano we made our way back to base camp where we had the traditional Icelandic lamb soup. Absolutely delicious! And also a hot drink. The staff are so friendly. Then it was time for the 3 1/2 km hike back to the meeting point. This is an experience I’ll never forget and always treasure. Although expensive, it was worth every penny. A must if you go to Iceland. Highly recommended."
Great experience with a very professional team!,The team were really informative and the experience was really well run. Very interesting and definitely worth a visit!
Great experience!,"Beautiful magma chamber! Descending there in the lift is very impressive, very nice and friendly guides and the lady manager in the hut, who fed us traditional icelandic meat soup, which was very nice and warming!Surreal landscapes all around!"
Amazing!,"This is an experience not to be missed!  It is hard to describe the size and color of the interior of the magma chamber, but it was stunning!!!  The guides were great, and the soup was yummy (thanks for including a veggie option!).  Definitely worth the walk across the lava field path to the volcano."
Terrific experience,"This tour was fantastic and well worth the time.  We had a rainy day, but it didn't detract from the tour.  You start with a 45 minute easy hike to the crater entrance and are then lowered into the crater in a specialized lift.  The lift takes about 6-7 minutes to descend.  You then have roughly 30 minutes to walk along a circular path in the crater itself.  This is the only crater of it's kind in the world apparently.  When the magma finished flowing, the crater remained intact, when normally it would have collapsed.  It's therefore a very unique experience.  You can see lots of colour in the rocks - caused by the minerals left behind after the eruption.  After the hike back to base camp, you get warm soup, coffee and tea.  I would highly recommend this tour."
You must do this,"If you are traveling to Iceland, you have to go Inside the Volcano. Imagine descending through a narrow crevice nearly 400 feet into a huge magma chamber containing rocks colored red, green, black and touches of white. As you wander through the chamber in semidarkness, all you can hear are drops of water and the murmur of other visitors. AND THEN: Your guide begins singing in Icelandic, and the sound echoes around you (at least our guide did). The guides will tell you folk tales that sound like darker versions of Snow White and Cinderella.Plus, afterward you get a steaming bowl of Mr. T's delicious lamb or vegetable soup - YUM!This was the coolest thing I've ever done - if you are wondering if it's worth the money IT IS. I don't think there is another experience like it in the world."
Once in a lifetime opportunity to get inside a volcano,"This was one of the most impressive tours that I have done in Iceland: a fantastic level of organization, the team is absolutely marvelous and the volcano itself is breathtaking. Must do in Iceland, as this is the only volcano where you can get deep down."
Add to your bucketlist!!!,"Absolutely amazing experience.  Well organised team and enthusiastic guides, website provides all the information you need to know about warm clothing etc.  Please take this seriously as you are at altitude near the ski fields and the weather is unpredictable and be quite cold.  However, it is totally worth the effort to experience this unique natural phenomenon.Short hike across the lava fields to the entrance, paced well for the less fit or younger members of the party, and then you go down into the volcano, which is just breath-taking and so interesting in its formation.Guides take your safety seriously, and they are well staffed, and we loved their stories about Icelandic culture and the singing was beautiful.It is clear that a lot of money and effort has gone into providing the infrastructure so you don't damage the lava fields walking or have an accident, becasue the lava fields are fragile, and the whole operation is well-staffed with qualified people. The tasty soup afterwards was a warm and welcome bonus.  We would not call this expensive for the quality and the duration of the experience, and we considered it worth every cent. We booked online several months in advance as it is very popular, and we wanted to be sure we would not miss out on our few days in Reykjavik.  They pick you up from your hotel, or you can self-drive to the meeting point."
Amazing experience and terrific people!,"This tour was the thing I most wanted to do in Iceland, and it met all my expectations! Everyone was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. The experience itself was unlike anything I've ever done. Yes, it's expensive, but it is a once in a lifetime chance. Go for it!"
Breath-taking Experience!,"The tour from start to finish was an absolutely marvelous experience! The hike to and from the mountains through the lava fields had amazing views of the surroundings and was tons of fun. Our two guides and all the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and made the experience that much greater. Inside the actual volcano is just absolutely breath-taking! No words or pictures can do it justice and it must be seen in person to fully appreciate the natural wonders. They served us a soup (lamb or vegetarian option) after we came back from the volcano and before we made the hike back; the vegetable soup was one of the most delicious things I'd eaten on our whole trip to Iceland! Just as a note, it can get very chilly on the hike and especially inside the volcano so definitely come dressed appropriately to avoid having your experience soiled by improper dressing."
What An Adventure!,"Our family of four did this tour (it was my husband and I and our two children, ages 18 and 12).  We drove ourselves from Reykjavik, which was a nice drive until we hit the thickest fog we've ever experienced along the volcanic roads leading to the meeting point!  It actually set quite a spooky and otherworldly scene for our volcano adventure!  Because of the fog, a lot of the people, including the ones being picked up in Reykjavik by the Inside the Volcano company, were late to the site, but they waited on everyone to arrive.The hike out was long and started out in a driving wind and rain and dense fog, so it was kind of cool in a wear-you-out while freaking-you-out kind of way.  I'm not particularly fit but I kept up with the quick pace of the group, only falling behind near the end when the final incline begins but even then I was just a maybe twenty steps behind the main group and there were some ladies probably forty steps behind me...they have a leader guide and a ""back end"" guide who stays at the end of the group in case people fall behind.  Once there, you get suited up to go in the volcano for about 45-50 minutes and when you return, there's soup waiting for you (lamb or vegetarian).A few things I think people should know.  They've obviously put a lot of work into the path through the volcano fields recently because they are now all cleared out with nice gravel and mainly even walking spaces.  If you were just doing the walk through the lava fields, I would say you could probably get away with trainers instead of hiking boots.  But what they don't really talk about is that, once you're in the volcano, it is extremely rocky and uneven and I can't imagine doing it without hiking boots.  There are places where you definitely have to use your hands to scramble up rocks and down steep slopes.  I guess you could go down the volcano and not do the exploring along the rocky paths, but that seems like a lot of walking for not getting to do a lot of actual exploring.Another thing I didn't see mentioned as we were planning this, is that they put you in groups before you leave the first lodge for the lava field hike.  Group one goes down the volcano first when you arrive  while the others sit and have soup, then once group one has been down for a while, group two heads down, and so on.  Once you're done with the volcano and the soup, you can actually head back across the lava field on your own if you'd like, which we did and honestly it was more enjoyable because it was just our family and we could go at our own pace.So if you need to be somewhere after the tour, you might ask to be in the earlier groups because you can head off on your own once you're done.  The website says to take 6 hours for the tour but we did the 8am morning tour and were back to our car at 12:30 even with the big delay at the beginning due to the fog.Overall, a magnificent experience that we would highly recommend.  It's not cheap, but you've come all the way to Iceland so I'd say this is a good splurge!"
Unique but overpriced,Unique experience to enter known now and preserved magma chamber. Single operator..really overpriced. Geologically real wonder. Impressd with concern for safety and knowledge of guide and staff there.soup taste extra delicious after hr of hiking .Thank god have some interest and background in volcanic mountains otherwise you will feel there is nothing same as first person who entered cave felt.enjoyed overall if we deduct over pricing factor.
Geological Wonder,"Fantastic geological curiosity!  No where else in the world can you enter a freak accidental preservation of a magma chamber.  Access into the chamber is excellent with very extensive safety equipment and precautions.  Tour sizes very small, so not crowded in the chamber.  Guides and base camp personnel very knowledgeable.  We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience!"
An awesome experience,We went on this trip on Saturday 22nd June 11am departure. We were extremely fortunate to have perfect weather - blue skies and no wind. The pick up was on time  and the walk across the lava was relaxing - we were in the third group to go down into the volcano. The waiting period was no problem. We had ample time to take lots of photos & walk around/scramble across the rocks with the aid of ropes.  The staff were pleasant & the lamb soup lunch was delicious. We are both in our mid 60’s and found the whole trip easy. The bus driver was kind enough to drop us off near the flea market once back in town. The whole outing was for 5 hours.
Awesome experience!,"This was an amazing experience, tour guides were great and everything was very well run.  Would highly recommend!"
Terrific views and Outstanding Soup !,"We visited the inside volcano today and despite foggy and misty weather the team there was very helpful. There are yellow raincoats available in case you donot have water proof attire. If the rain is heavy you may still get wet.There is a 4 km hike with some moderate upslope one way . But once you reach the volcano tube it’s a smooth way down the elevator into the tube cavern claimed to be the deepest and only truly original lava tube that’s stayed open.They give you around 45’ to take pics and pics do come  out fabulous.In return we were served with one of the best flavorsome vegetable ( vegetarian ) soup made by “Adda” at the base station of Prihnlika Gtgur as they call this lava tube . The soup is truely wholesome and for us strict vegetarians this was a heavenly surprise. It was by far one of the best vegetable soups I have ever had , even better than in India or UK! Bless Adda’s heart !"
"Accommodated our mistake, who does this?","We enjoyed a week touring around the island, returning back to Reykavik to spend two days in the city and looking forward to our ""Inside the Volcano"" tour happening the next day. When we looked at our receipt the day of our tour, we realized we had booked the tour incorrectly and had missed the tour by a day. Our husbands were so disappointed to have made this error but after making a few phone calls to the tour company they agreed to fit them in on our last day in the country. They certainly did not have to do this for them but we sure appreciated it. Thank you so much, the tour was amazing!"
Amazing,Well worth the money. I did not expect it to be so cool. Amazingly colorful. And fort hose of you who are afraid of heights: I am too and the lift is not a problem. It feels very safe.
Truly an Amazing Experience,"Inside the Volcano is a unique and our if this world experience.  This is the only well-preserved volcano in the world that you can go inside from the surface and look to it from within. You go down 400 ft. which is part of the fun. The photo and video opportunities are incredible. You would always ask yourself how are volcanos created and how do they burst from inside and how they end up.  Well, you will find out and look into it directly in this tour.  The tour includes hiking for about 45 minutes through a lava field with an amazing tour guide that is super knowledgeable and friendly.  Had the best of time with all tour guides. On top of the volcano there is a nice view of REK. This tour is a must for all geology-fans, and thrill takers.  This tour totally worth the money. An experience I will never forget!"
Amazing experience!,Well worth the money. Staff is excellent and enjoy their work which makes the visit even more enjoyable for the participants.
Possibly one of the coolest things we've ever done!,"We signed up to do this as an excursion through the group we were traveling with.  Several of our friends signed up, so we did too.  We didn't pay a ton of attention to the description / details ... just that it sounded interesting and our friends were going as well.  OMG!  What an amazing outing we had.  Very helpful and knowledgable staff.  We felt very safe.  The hike to the volcano was interesting and our guide stopped to point out several points / items of interest along the way.  And then the descent in to the volcano and our short hike around the inside.  TOO COOL!!!!!!!!  If you are considering this tour / outing, ""just do it!""!  You won't regret it!!"
Magical Trip with perfect team!,This trip is really awsome! Since 30 years I visit caves all over Europe and even explored them as caver. The volcano is outstanding and incomparable with any limestone-cave I know.
It’s a freaking volcano!!!,"The only downfall about the experience is the cost but with that being said...it was well worth it.  Our guide, Adda, was very knowledgeable about the geology of the surrounding area and was also entertaining. Prior to heading out on the hike, we were both given a neck gaiter. The hike to the volcano wasn’t bad, about 4 miles there and back. Once we got to base camp we were divided into 3 groups. We were provided with a helmet and a climbing harness for the ride on the lift to descend the 180 meters down inside the volcano. The colors inside the volcano are amazing and photos on the website are definitely not photoshopped. Since it’s the only volcano on the planet that has an empty magma chamber, it’s definitely a once in a lifetime experience. After exiting the volcano and walking back to base camp, you are offered soup to help warm you up. They have two different kinds, vegetable and lamb soup. The lamb soup is delicious. There is also a gift shop at base camp and the items seem to be fairly priced.  During the hike back, we had enough time to stop and explore a magma tube called Langihellir. Adda told us an Icelandic folklore story and sang us a verse to an Icelandic lullaby. All in all it was a great experience and would highly recommend this tour."
Absolutely dynamite!,"This was an amazing experience, from beginning to end. The operation was so smooth and the team professional. This is very unique and something I would do again in a heartbeat. If you aren’t claustrophobic then I’d add this to your top three things to do in Iceland. It is worth the price and you can tell they’ve put money into the operation to make it comfortable and memorable for guests. You won’t find any tourist buses here....I loved this experience, and so did the other 7 people in our group. Thank you!"
An amazing one of a kind natural site to see,It was a great experience and quite an amazing natural site to see. The staff onsite were very knowledgeable about the site and Icelandic volcanic history .The safety of everyone was always their first concern. A great big thanks to all of you and especially Helga for helping us get there.   (good soup!)
Simply amazing,"Well organized, very kind guides and amazing view inside the volcano. If you are in Iceland you should visit this place!"
Fantastic!,"We debated doing this adventure due to the price, but realized it was worth it once we were standing inside the volcano. It’s the only place on earth you can do this and we are glad we didn’t miss the opportunity to see this amazing, beautiful place for ourselves.  Great guides (and soup!) as well."
Volcano Experience,"Very knowledgeable guides who are enthusiastic and friendly.  Great experience for my wife, son, and I."
Expensive but worth it,"It will cost you a pretty penny, but it is worth it. You see the exact path the lava took during the eruption. So many colors!! I should also mention that the staff was relaxed and nice. We brought our 10 old knowing very well the wife and I would have to split up so we could watch him. Instead one of the female guides watched him for us, so we could see the beauty together. I promise you this tour is worth your time and money!!!"
Once in a lifetime experience ,"Photos don't do it justice.  After a short 40 min hike you descend 180m in a lift to the chamber. The change in colors and textures is indescriptible, totally recommendable."
A fun experience,Enjoyed the hike over lava fields with low lying fog.  The descent was beautiful.  Inside was an array of vibrant colors.  The hike around the inside was more challenging than I expected crawling over steep wet rocks.  Glad I did it though.  Back at the hut the hot soup and hearty bread was perfect.
An impressive trip toward the center of the earth,"Accompanied by a team of professionals. I was a little worried when we were put put in the same group as loud people; I did not want my experience to be spoiled by shouts in the volcano, so I voiced my concern to the manager of the station and our guide did tell the group that it is recommended to be quiet inside, therefore I had the most enjoyable time in the volcano :-)At some point, the conductor of the lift sang local songs that diffused in the entire chamber, it was magical and so much more appropriate to the site than noisy tourists!Thank you for that wonderful moment!"
Great way to kickoff our week in Iceland,"This was a great experience for my family. We drove to the ski lodge (meeting point) and enjoyed the hike to base camp with the group.  The trail was a super easy hike (gravel path to basecamp across lava field).  Honestly, this could be done with any type of closed toed shoes.  The experience inside the volcano was incredible.  The ride down was probably my favorite. All staff were friendly, knowledgeable and fun.  The lamb stew hit the spot at the end of the excursion.  Was it worth the high cost for a family of 4?  My answer would be DEFINITELY!"
Once In A Lifetime Experience,"This was an incredible adventure. This is the only volcano where you can descend 120m into the earth! The entire experience from beginning to end was done smoothly. We opted for a pick up in Reykjavik and the bus arrived on time and dropped us off with no delays (other than local traffic). Our guides, Yonas and Sholay were fantastic and accommodated all the different levels of hikers from our group. Yonas was funny, engaging and very informative. I highly recommend this experience!"
Amazing experience ,What a wonderful day. The only place to actually decent inside a Volcano. The staff were amazing and the lamb soup after the decent was an added bonus. Thank you
Best Birthday Experience!!,Want to make any occasion truly special and unique? Do this!! All of the tour guides are first class and went out of their way to make my special day special - THANK YOU ALL!!  Being elevated down into a volcano and then hiking around in a magma chamber should have been on my bucket list - revision made and checked off.  I had an unequivocal blast!! Highly recommend.
Great Experience!,"Tour included myself, husband and 11 year old son. This was actually my son's pick.  My husband enjoyed the hike most while my son and I enjoyed being in the volcano the most. It is very rocky and uneven inside the volcano and my son gave me slight heart attacks at times as he was climbing up and all over the rocks as allowed but the experience is incredible. The colors are simply spectacular."
Once you accept the price it is an amazing experience.,We are glad we did it although the price was really high. Once entering the volcano you will be spoiled with an amazing environment and plenty of colours. It really is a unique experience as it is the only magma chamber that can be accessed worldwide!
Inside the Volcano Tour,"This tour was everything I’d hoped it to be! Absolutely incredible and very surreal! From someone who has never seen a volcano... let alone get inside of one... it is was quite interesting to say the least! Actually, this was the tour that brought me to Iceland I’m the first place! I first heard about it over the course of some research I was doing on Volcanoes, when I came across this tour! I made it a point to go pack my bags and plan a trip! The staff there was absolutely incredible! Very knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and tons of fun! Overall, it’s a must see tour!"
Not to be missd,"Hike was about 2 mile with some incline but not hard. Dress warmly, inside volcano is cold. Amazing to be inside volcano and hike was picturesque."
Inside volcano,This was more than expected. You have to walk about 45-50 minutes to get to base camp before entering the volcano. This was definitely worth the walk. Amazing to be standing inside a volcano and see the changes inside
breathtaking is an understatement,I booked this not knowing what to expect. I was late for my free shuttle pickup and called the service. Immediately they sent me a shuttle to pick me up so I don't miss it. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. You hike around 40 minutes in an easy trail with a couple of interesting stops along the way. Then we reach a camp centre for refreshments and they divide us into two groups coz the lift that takes us 120 meters inside the volcano has a limited capacity. The ride was exhilarating. You get to see 5000 years worth of eruptions in 30 minutes. We spent more than enough time in there taking all the pics we like. After we finished inside a delicious lamb soup was waiting us. Vegetarian option was available too. All in all it takes around 4 hours. WELL SPENT. Highly recommended.
Great excursion,This was truly a great excursion. Enjoyed it with our adult daughter traveling with us. Being able ti see inside a magma cave was amazing. Hike up and trail inside are not for people unsure of foot. Our group tried both types of soup and enjoyed by all.
Awe Inspiring,"Absolutely a must see if you are in the capital area. It is about a 2 mile walk each way along mostly gentle sloped gravel paths. The last 10 minutes of the walk is pretty steep, but you are not rushed if anyone in the family has to take it slow."
Amazing experience!,Wouldn’t expect it can be so amazing ! Very very interesting tour and great service. Can highly recommend this tour :)
Amazing sights!  Well worth the trip.,"Definitely, pay attention to the clothing suggestions from other guests.  The weather changes quickly.  The hike was a long one for an out-of-shape 50-something like me, but it was worth it.  Get more from your experience by asking questions--the tour guides usually have good answers."
Surpassed Expectations,"Travelled to Iceland specifically to do this trip - and was not disappointed. From initial query, to booking, payment and other questions, right until the final farewell from our guide, everyone was so friendly and helpful, the guides knowledgable and personable. The 3km trek was very manageable - you’d need to have a little bit of fitness to do it though, although the wind was bitingly cold on the day we went, so layers, layers, layers. Descending into the volcano was otherworldly, in fact, I lost my words upon seeing it for the first time, and could only utter ‘wow’. Really worth it."
Amazing experience,"This tour takes you inside the Þríhnúkagígur volcano. The hike to the base camp is nice and easy, it´s about 3 km walk each way and we´ve been lucky to get awesome weather. The staff offers you coffee and teas before you hike to the top of the volcano where the lift will take you down for 120 meters. When descended, a new world opens up: shades of yellow, purple, red and black catch your eyes and mesmerize you. The tour guide tells you some facts and then leave you some time to roam around the magma chamber, there is a path but it´s a bit slippery at some points. therefore, good shoes are a must. It´s a truly once in a lifetime experience that blows your mind, especially if you try to imagine all the natural forces involved and the creation process! A good soup warms you up after the tour and gives you plenty of energy to hike back, I had the veggie soup and the portion was generous. Definitely recommended, 5 stars totally deserved, it´s a must to see and experience while in Iceland. (Tip: The tour gets fully booked quite easily and it´s wise to book it now if you are thinking about it)"
Just go for it !,Although expensive ( everything is in Iceland) well worth splashing out.  When are you likely to get the opportunity again !Great walk up to the volcano and then an amazing descent in the open cage . Very friendly guides and a very welcome bowl of soup after the descent .luckily we had great weather .
Excellent interesting tour,30 min hike from base camp to the volcano. 6 min descent to the bottom. 30 min time at the bottom. 30 min is just enough time to look around and get photos. Take time to look around and soak it in. After we came out there was free lamb stew before the hike back to base camp.
Interesting experience of on of the must see spots in Iceland,"I went on the tour in May and unfortunately we got very bad weather conditions. Walk front and back to the camp was quite difficult due to the constant rain, wind and zero visibility. In a normal day I believe it’s an easy walk with some beautiful sights of volcanic area and green moss covering the field.Bryndís was the main guide that day and she was truly awesome! Managed to talk to her quite a bit and it was always very interesting chats. Wished though the tour itself would still have more of a personal and local touch. The time in the camp wasn’t anyhow interesting for the visitors and probably it would be great for the next visitors to try to share with new guests some local experience, stories even to sing a song together would be interesting! It felt that as a group we weren’t anyhow connected what was sad since we spent few hours together :) Simply think there’s a room for improvement since you have a wonderful staff and guides :)The volcano itself and the experience of the lift is of course beautiful and very special. I enjoyed the time in the chamber and all the colours of the rocks inside. Something special indeed! The whole experience is generally great and definitely worth it! Maybe for a bit lower price all the future visitors would be fully satisfied (some previous comments are mentioning the high price vs value problem).Thank you Inside the Volcano for an amazing time anyway! :)"
Great tour and wonderful experience!,My family and I did this tour a few days ago- what a phenomenal tour. Very educational and well done. The tour guides and other staff were EXTREMELY informative and super nice. Great hike and beautiful scenery. Well done. Not hokey at all!
O.M.G.,"It's not often I'm speechless, but this trip is truly amazing. Can't praise the guides enough. I'm not that young and have arthritic knees but those girls really looked after me. We didn't have the best weather. ""Waterproof"" clothing does not exist!!! But my its all worth it. The colours inside the volcano are super, the guides knowledge fantastic. I can only say JUST DO IT."
Fascinating,"Wonderful experience, well organised, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Learnt lots and was fascinated by the views"
Truely unique!,"I went on this tour in order to test the tour for customers. The tour itself is truely unique and this is the only place on the planet where you can see this phenomenon. The guides were knowlegable and the tor was well organized. The equipment was in a very good state and safety regulations were first priority. They served a delicious soup and there was free tea, coffee and water. Great trip overall!"
Must try this!,This was the highlight of my trip to Iceland. The meeting site is about 30-40 minutes from Reykjavik. We hike to the volcano base camp for about 45 minutes. The hike is also a wonderful experience as you see the unique lava landscape. The tour guide team provide careful measures for our safety. The visit inside the volcano was fantastic and beautiful. We were told this is the only volcano in the world you can actually go inside. After the visit inside the volcano you get a delicious soup at the base camp (traditional lamb or vegetable soup). Totally worth the cost and the time. Total duration from my hotel and back was about 5.5 hours. I highly recommend.
Amazing inside view,"Since our pick-up was not finalised while booking, we called and mailed Arctic Adventures (with whom we booked), just a day before the trip. Recd very prompt reply and confirmation of pick-up point. The pick-up bus driver was courteous and patient when I told him that he had arrived 20 mins earlier. He patiently waited for the rest of my family. The pick-up from various city locations for various trips is organised by Gray Line Icleand. Hence the possibility of the bus reaching early happens. So please be at your pick-up point ahead of time. Our guide who calls himself T (Triggnoshome -  did I get it right?) was really hilarious. I just love the Icelandic sense of humour.After a change of bus at Gray Line Bus terminal , the drive took about45 mins to reach the meeting point. Here, we were provided with safety harness, helmet with headlight  and hot coffee. Washrooms are provided here.The trek from here to the top the volcano is approxi. 3kms and takes about 45-60 mins depending on the conditions. We were told that this area receives a lot of rainfall but were very lucky since it was just a cool sunny day with no rains. So, besides inner wear, and fleece / wind-proof jackets/pants, one may need rain pants/shirts if reqd.T was very knowledgeable and very very considerate of all the group members age and fitness. He gave us all commercial breaks (as he calls it ) every 15-20 mins and went on explain how the volcanoes are formed, what all we will see inside the volcano, etc. The last 100 mtrs stretch to the base camp was slightly steep.After a brief break  here (washroom provided) , we were taken in 3 groups inside the volcano. The stretch from the base to the top (75 mtrs)  is very steep and one has to wear gloves all the time. It was just cold out there. HFrom the top,  we were taken down 120mtrs via a lift. The safety precautions taken by the staff here is very commendable.The view inside the volcano is really awesome. My son and daughter (in their twenties) just kept exploring and exploring. Inside the volcano, it was just cool.After approximately 20-30 mins exploring the volcano, we returned to the base where we were served with hot tasty vegan soup as per our choice.The trip back by bus was also made interesting by the driver , who went on sharing his knowledge of the glaciers that were visible enroute.Overall, the trip was very well organised and full of fun. All we four adult family members thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful trip."
Fabulous! Loved it!,"As many reviewers have said, you must go on the ""Inside the Volcano"" tour. Our guides were friendly, knowledgeable and set a comfortable pace on the walk from the starting point, to the volcano and back. They even accommodated a guest in our group who needed extra time to walk in both directions. We loved the small group size, the soup was delicious and the colors inside the volcano were incredible. Truly an excellent tour that was well worth the cost."
It must bee seen,It must bee seen at least once in life.Organisation is perfect.Groups are small.Soup is great :-)Thank you guys
Volcano tour,This was one of the best and well organized tours I’ve done in a long time. The soup that they make you at the end is out of this world and is amazing
Inside the volcano,"If you are thinking about doing the Inside the volcano tour, stop thinking and just do it. Yes, it’s expensive. And yes, I would absolutely do it again. If I did, I would probably take my oldest, who is 10. My wife did the tour the day after I did, and we both feel the same way. This is a once in a lifetime experience, and you are not going to see colors and beauty like this anywhere else. So like I said, go do it!"
Very cool if you like hiking and caving,"The pick up process for this tour can be lengthy, so plan for this to be your only scheduled activity.  One bus picks you up at your hotel, you are taken to another site where you board the Journey to the Center of the Earth bus which transports you to the base camp. This involves a 2 mile hike on a gravel trail across a barren lava field.  The hike is a little steep as you climb the volcano to the gear shed.  Wear good hiking shoes and be able to climb over rocks. The guides break everyone into smaller groups so there is a bit of waiting for each group to gear up and go.  The cave is stunning but the walk is fairly short inside.  It is not any sort of paved path and much of it is scrambling over little or large damp rocks. The guides make a vegetable or lamb soup after the hike. There are good views of Reykjavik from the very top of the volcano. We were in the last group so we had to hurry a bit to hike back after lunch.  It is a pricey excursion so you have to decide if it is worth it.  We enjoy caving and hiking so it was a great fit for us.  We had beautiful weather.  In cold or in the famous ""Iceland sideways rain"" this could be a miserable 4 miles of hiking."
Great experience.,Great adventure if you can afford it!Relatively easy hike.  Dress warmly anytime of year.  Soup was delicious.
Entering another world,"It was really an amazing experience entering into the earth where volcano erupted and nature left it for us to visit and see what it has. Took so many pictures, but none of them really reflected what was visible to our eyes. Felt the price a bit higher per person, but it is all to do with the effort they are taking to take us safely and giving the experinece of inside the earth and bringing us back."
Spectacular Half-day Tour,"This was an amazing experience! I’m so glad I did it. The views were astonishing, and the tour guide Bryndis was fun, friendly, and helpful.  I totally recommend doing this, especially if you have a shorter stay in Reykjavík. You will feel like you’ve voyaged to another world.Overall, this is an extremely responsible, safety-conscious group , and I highly recommend this. Also, as a solo female traveler, I still felt completely integrated into the small group and enjoyed my time hiking in with them. Some of the descriptions of the hiking made this sound more extreme than it is. It is a flat hike on a well-groomed gravel path until the last 10 minutes, which takes you up a moderate slope after having a coffee break/rest period in their hut. I’m not in great shape, and I did it with no problem.  Pack mittens and a hat."
40th birthday celebration,"We came to Iceland to celebrate a friend’s 40th birthday and this tour was our #1 favorite activity.  To be inside an actual volcano and see the colors and rock formations was indescribable.  Everything about it was magical.  The colors are breathtaking, the tour guides engaging, and the soup at the end was delicious!  Bring gloves and a hat for the hiking portion!"
Great Experience,This was one of the few guided tours we did in Iceland and we were glad we made the decision to do this activity.  The walk to the base camp was flat most all of the way and the staff was friendly and welcoming.  The trek down the volcano was very cool and was do-able even for someone with a bit of a fear of heights.  The inside of the volcano is incredible and you are given the opportunity to explore on your own for a bit once down there.  I would highly recommend this activity!
Absolutely Stunning,The only place like it in the world. Stunningly beautiful and worth every penny and every step of the walk to get there.The guides were very excellent and knowledgeable and had excellent humour.I would thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone. You won't regret it.
A long walk but well worth it. ,"The tour is well-organized and run. You start out with a brief lecture and some tea/coffee/hot chocolate, then a detailed (but not too lengthy) briefing about how the tour will work.After that you head out on a 3 km hike on a relatively smooth gravel path to ""base camp,"" where you're divided into groups of six, geared up (helmet and harness), and led to the lift, which takes you down 120 metres into the volcano.The view is amazing, and you're down there where you can wander around (within a roped-off area) for half an hour before the lift takes you back up.From there, you head back to ""base camp,"" where you're given hot soup, then guided back the 3 km way you came to the starting point.Tips:1) Wear stable walking shoes. My girlfriend wore new runners and those did OK, but barely.2) Bring warm clothes. It's about 4 Celsius in the volcano.3) Bring a camera that works well in low light. The pictures here are from my Samsung Galaxy S8+, so you can be the judge of how well it did....and that's it as far as I can tell. It was a real once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I'm glad I did it."
The Best Tour in Iceland,The tour is amazing!  The staff was very knowledgeable and patient.  I couldn’t have asked for a better guide who stayed with me the whole time. No trip toIceland is complete without experiencing this amazing place!
Wonderful experience,"This tour was absolutely great!  The experience of hiking to the volcano to descend into the magma chamber, while being provided with interesting information from friendly guides, exceeded my hopes and expectations.  We had lots of time in the chamber and after returning to base camp, we had delicious Icelandic meat soup. Proper footwear is absolutely necessary. I went on May 18th so it was a little rainy, which I expected, so I had brought light-weight rain pants and jacket with me to Iceland, but they will provide you with yellow raincoats if required.  The 2 mile hike each way is at a brisk, but easy walking pace.  This tour was an experience I will never forget!"
"Great tour, Great guides","Really enjoyed this. Our guide, “T”, was great. Informative and funny. Approximately a 2 mile hike each direction but easy walking. The lift down inside the volcano is quick and it’s a great and colorful view down.  Once down, you get about 30 minutes to walk around and take picture. Time wise, it’s perfect as you start to run out of pictures to take and then it’s back up. They offer soup when your finished but I passed so I can’t comment on it. Walk back was on your own but enjoyable since you can stop and take pictures at leisure."
Fantastic,"Such an experience. This is my third time visiting Iceland and I had never done this before. Definitely would recommend to anyone going to do it on their top 5 things to do. I wish I'd done it when I first ever came here. The walk is fine, not bad ground however I wouldn't do it in sandals or shoes that don't protect your feet.... people did and found it difficult. The walk is on gravel and rocks on the ground and inside the volcano itself is very uneven and all rock based paths. There is a superb view at the entrance to the volcano as well!Both camps are nice. Tour guides etc. all very friendly. Soup was nice and at the base camp they even had a shop with tops etc."
Fabulous tour,"My husband and I took this tour to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  We loved it.  The whole concept is amazing to start with.  The tour is extremely well run.  The two mile hike isn't too hard; some elevation gain near the volcano but flat otherwise.  Amazing what the inside of a volcano looks like!  Our guide was wonderful; lunch soup great.  As the tour recommends, it's a very good idea to have adequate clothing and hiking boots or shoes."
Loved every minute!,"We had no idea what to expect but read that CNN said it was in the top 20 things to do before you die. Incredibly unique experience and really well done. 2 mile hike to base camp followed by the inside of the volcano tour, warm soup and a 2 mile hike back. I think the tour could better prepare you on clothing (think layers) and always bring a rain coat as it usually rains but overall we have never done anything like it. Do it, it’s a once in a lifetime"
Unbelievable,"This is just unbelievable. This is the only place on earth where you can go inside the magmatic chamber of a volcano.Once inside, the colors are just unreal.WOW"
Amazing!,The people running it were so friendly and made the whole experience so amazing. A great addition to my dad and I’s trip!! A must if visiting Iceland!
An expensive experience - but totally worth it!,"I was really sceptical about paying nearly £300 for this experience - but decided it looked to be the only place in the world you could do this... so I had to!Sure enough - this is the only ""hollowed out"" volcano in the world (that is known) - and so yes - a globally unique experience!The hike across the lava field, I thought, was actually one of the most interesting parts - our guide was very knowledgeable, and pointed out a number of things I wouldn't have otherwise been aware of.""Base camp"" is warm and comfortable while you wait for your chance to go ""Into the Volcano"".All of the staff were very friendly and helpful - and all very knowledgeable on the subject.The volcano itself, was of course, fascinating too - and an experience I will be telling people about for many years to come!Would I do it again?  At the cost - probably not - it's a little too pricey.  That's not really a criticism - I can appreciate it is an expensive operation to maintain - it's just a little outside my usual budget for something like this.Well done though - I had a great time - I would gladly recommend it to anyone once."
Fantastic experience,The trip was exactly what I expected. The guides were friendly and knowledgeable. I loved the hike on the way to the volcano. Inside was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was beautiful. It was fun talking to other tourists and the guides while eating our soup. The weather was terrible. Rainy and cold. It didn't diminish the experience one bit. We were properly dressed and the tour provided a last-layer raincoat. It was wonderful.
Exciting experience,"My daughter and I had the opportunity to go on this tour this week.  It was unique, exciting, and interesting. I’m so glad  we booked this experience.  The guides were great.  Base camp was warm and welcoming.  I would rate the athleticism as moderate.  Please be aware you will be hiking about 1.5 miles each way.  Once inside the volcano be prepared to walk over some rocky terrain.  Weather can change fast so rain and wind are pretty common. If you have a sense of adventure this tour is definitely for you!"
Once in a lifetime ,"Although the weather was not very good, I still enjoyed the tour very much! There were 2 guides taking care of us, one was leading the group while another stayed at the back, to make sure no one got lost. The tour guides were friendly, caring and knowledgable, so as the other staff members. They divided us into three small groups to go down to the cave, trying not to make the cave too crowded. Every small group had 20 minutes to stay in the cave, which I hope it could be longer like 30 minutes haha! After we came back from the cave, they serve us their homemade Icelandic meat soup (lamb) or vegetables soup and some other hot drinks. The soup was so nice that I had two bowls! The price of the tour is not low, but I think it’s worth it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends!"
Great experience but could be better,overall I thought this experience was super cool! I have never seen anything like it anywhere else. Hike is basic to volcano takes about 45 min and then they harness you up to go inside. Afterwards we are given soup and some hot cocoa. The views were amazing as was the experience. My complaint is for the price I would have liked more information. They are doing this all day long and having more geological information or history about that period of time or ice age would have been really helpful. Even a timeline on the wall. I’m just saying we can all look up basic knowledge. I expected a little more information other than basics.Overall I would go if you have the time and the money!
Best Excursion,"As a Geologist, this was an opportunity of a lifetime. The guides were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The food was great and perfect for the colder weather. They gave you plenty of time to explore the chamber inside the volcano. My wife and I almost didn’t go on the excursion and I’m glad we decided to go. I would have regretted it."
Awesome,"Absolutely amazing place; just book it. Yes, you have a 2 mile hike each way, but the views are worth it. Yes it's expensive (we paid approx. 300 GBP each) and if such places were available to see anywhere then maybe you wouldn't pay it, but it's worth it as it's simply unique!The 350ft ride down to the bottom really gives you a sense of the place as the chamber opens up for you in all of it's glory. The colours are beautiful. Just be careful down there as to get around it's very rocky, but making a smooth path down there would take away the natural ambience so keep it as it is.And as a bonus, the guide who took us across there was one of the main characters in Trapped Season 2 if you are interested :)"
Great Tour!,"We had a great time on the hike, into the volcano, and at the base camp. The soup at the end was amazing and a great surprise! Definitely a highlight of our great trip!"
Once in a lifetime!,"Amazing and breathtaking experience! Speechless! Although it is a little expensive, I 100% recommend! Amazing, helpful and friendly guides. Thank you so much for this experience!"
You MUST do this tour!,"How many times you will say that you went inside a volcano!Well it was an amazing experience. We met the 2 guides Solveig and Victor on location. The website of the company explains excactly how to get there. After the meeting there was a small hike for 45 min to the base camp. The landscape is amazing so you will not realise how the times passes. After we had a really nice and detailed briefing about the volcano , they separated us in groups of 6 so it made it more personal and off we go ! The pictures can't describe the feeling and what you see ! It is amazing ! After about 30-40 min the lift(Viðir another guide) took us up again and we had the best lamb soup ever by Mister T. I wanted to stay there forever ! Highly reccommend!"
Awesome but expensive ,In a location where most things aren’t cheap this was the most expensive one off thing I did. But it truly was remarkable. It was other worldly in a way I hadn’t imagined or could describe. I have been inside caves but apart from both being holes in the earth they weren’t nearly the same. I was surprised with the impression it made. The dusting of snow that had fallen when we emerged was the icing on the outing. I may well not have gone though if I was paying for more than me so was pleased I was alone.
Only go if you have time and money,"We went with two teenage boys last summer. We had great weather and the hike there was beautiful. The descent is cool and the overall atmosphere and colors were exciting and lovely. Overall it's fun. BUT there are so many amazing things to do in Iceland. This takes a big chunk of a day, and is very expensive. Though we enjoyed it, it was one of the less memorable parts of our trip, and is about $400 per person. So go if you have money to burn and have a week or more in Iceland, otherwise do something else even more fantastic."
Amazing experience!,"My 2 sons and I voted this as the coolest thing we saw in Iceland! Scenery was great, Hike to the volcano was beautiful. Staff was very experienced, welcoming and kind. Equipment was in excellent condition and being inside a volcano was a once in a lifetime event! Do this if you can!!!"
It was a surprise for me,"I had no idea what was happening, my husband planned the excursion as a surprise. There is a hike across a lava field at a quick pace. Then the hike up the mountain. I was good with that, it wasn’t until we began the decent down the volcano that I became anxious. It was worth it! The experience was second to none. This is a must do! The colors are incredibly fascinating.The soup after the tour was a delightful surprise after our adventure. I was especially pleased with the little Arctic Fox that visited the area."
Once In A Lifetime Experience,"Well worth the money! How often do you get to go inside a volcano? We met the group at a building off the main road (see last photo). We self drove but you can also take a bus from Reykjavik. Once the tour guided arrived they gave us a recap of our journey to the volcano. We began the walk to the volcano which was mostly flat but you have to watch your step so you don't trip on volcanic rock. Once you get to the base of the hill, there is a building on the left where they give you safety gear and tell you what you can and can't do when inside. Then they bring you up the hill in groups.There is an elevator that slowly descends and you get strapped in for safety.Once inside you can explore the volcano for about 30-45 minutes. So many colors! Our tour guide sang an Icelandic song to fill the quiet cavern for a tranquil and inspiring experience. A new group decends and signals it's time for us to leave. Wish there was more time to enjoy it but I understand they don't want people to destroy it either. Great view from the top too!Afterwards, they give you the most delicious lamb (or veggie) soup. They have souvenirs you can buy. If you self drove you can walk on your own back to the cars at your own pace."
You are free to roam the volcano!,"Expect a long hike along a rocky pathway. Once you arrive at the facility, you will be furnished with safety equipment. A short walk will take you to the mouth of the volcano. After an approximate 7-minute ride to the bottom (which feels so much faster), you are on the floor of the volcano. I love that once inside, you can roam freely. At the end of the tour, we had the pleasure of enjoying the soup which was include. Luckily, there was also a vegetarian soup available."
Breathtaking Experience,"Complete experience, from staff members, hike, volcano, lamb soup, is just amazing. There's absolutely no way I can put in words the fulfillment and happiness derived from the experience. If there's an excursion you want to take, it is this one no exception. A huge shoutout to the team, they are the most humbled, funny, friendly people I experienced in the whole country!"
Kaboom! True once in a lifetime experience!,"Holly sh*t, we are inside a volcano! Thats what you will be thinking as you decend into the depths of this antient lave Shute! Hundreds of feet to the volcano floor! There you will have an opportunity to explore. It’s amazingly colorful and awe inspiring site. Professional and friendly staff make this experience safe, without limiting your ability to investigate the environment. True once in a lifetime experience!"
Twice in a lifetime,"I have experienced this journey twice to date. What a journey. After pickup from the hotel, you are transferred to another coach at their coach terminal. The ride onward gives wonderful views; just like all of Iceland. Once arrived at the lodge, you are briefed and then start the hike out to base camp.The land is stark and beautiful. The hike to base camp is not hard, only time consuming. Generally, there are 2 guides with the group; one in front and one in back. Don't worry about keeping up with the others if you walk slower, they will never rush you. But please understand that you need to be able to walk at least an hour through uneven surface fairly easily to make it to base camp. All the while knowing, you must go back from whence you came.Base camp is where you will helmet and harness up, but it is also a place to sit and get to know your fellow travellers. You will also be offered some soup while you wait as they take only a small group out of your group at a time down into the volcano. Once it is your groups time, you again face the exciting weather of Iceland and start your climb up the volcanic hill. It is a lot steeper than the initial hike and can be tricky as rebar has been place in the trail to help give traction. But mind you don't trip on that odd step.The lift operator is great. He gives you thoughtful information on the ride down into the chamber. Once you land in the chamber, he will unhook your safety rope and your group will gather in the centre of the chamber for a brief talk from your guide. And then you have lots of time to walk around and enjoy the beauty of something that has the potential of being so destructive.The path in the chamber is rock filled with lots of ups and down. Mind where you step and take your time. If you have questions, ask. The guide is very helpful with information.When your time is complete in the chamber, you return to the surface and then wait at base camp until your entire group has completed their journey. Your return hike toward the lodge is filled with interesting information. The guide, if the weather is cooperating, will stop and explain the terrain as well as there is the possibility of entering a lava tube.The journey is wonderful. I have done it twice now. The price may seem to be a bit more than you are willing to pay for such a journey, but ask yourself this; what price pay for experience? No where else are you able to experience such beauty of the Earth in such a wonderful setting. The second time I went I took friends. It was a highlight of their holiday. Travel more. Experience more. Enjoy Iceland."
Unforgettable visit,"This is something you don't want to miss. The history of this place is unbelievable. Though it has a long hike before entering the volcano, it really worths every step. Markus and Helga are so amazing and all the guides are super helpful and awesome. Not to mention the soothing delicious Icelandic soup at the end of your visit! 😊"
What an amazing experience,"The tour inside the volcano was an amazing experience. Arriving at the ski cabin the very nice and friendly tour guides gave us a quick summary of the schedule for the next couple of hours. Afterwards we walked through the snow to the volcano which took us around 45 minutes. After the arrival at the foot of the volcano we could heat up with coffee and tee. Getting ready with safety harness and helmet we were good to climb up to the crater an the ""elevator"" which took us down."
Great Experience,"A friend suggested this trip and we finally got it in while in Iceland.  The hike may be a little long for those that are not in shape, but the way is not steep and it is a fairly even path. It was well worth the time and money and I would recommend it to anyone that is contemplating it."
Exceeded Expectations,"This is certainly one of those things that you have to do at least once in a lifetime. You hike through the lava fields to get to the volcano, experiencing some amazingly surreal landscapes. The tour managers take extra care to ensure your safety and are super-helpful should you have any questions. Just make sure to bring extra warm clothing. Highly recommended!"
Once in a lifetime experience,"Small walk from the parking lot to the volcano with interesting sights along the way. Once at the volcano, you are lowered inside and get to walk around inside for about half an hour. You are then returned to the surface where a hot soup awaits. Definitely worth the expense. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to see something very special. Especially interesting for those with an interest in volcanos and geology."
Amazing experience,"Three things I have to say first:- If you can afford it, DO IT.  You won't regret it.- Don't pay any attention to the weather in Reykjavik. The weather at the volcano will be totally different, and probably worse.- If they offer you rain gear, TAKE IT.This was an amazing experience.  The hike is not difficult, but long, and only steep for the last 5 minutes.  We did it in driving wind and rain, but the rubber rain coats they provide did a good job protecting us from the elements.  Good hiking shoes and water resistant pants are a must.  The descent into the volcano is otherworldly, and once inside the beauty of the rock formations and colors make it all worthwhile.  Too bad they only allow about 30 minutes inside, as we could have explored and be awed for hours.  Once out and back at the top base camp, the meat soup was delicious.  Perfect to warm us before the hike back."
Felt save and welcome all along,"The feeling was more like a trip with friends than a booked tour. The staff was great. But I felt safe the whole trip. They made me forgotten that I’m in an elevator in 100 of meters in the air. In the volcano it was mind-blowing: The colours, the freedom inside, to be in a place where such forces of natures has been one day. I could have stayed there longer although an other one said for him the 30-40 minutes where too long. He saw everything in half the time"
The only place you can do this!$,"Descending to the magma chamber of a once active volcano is an otherworldly experience that can only be done here. Why? Normally, volcanoes plug up with lava after an eruption. This volcano did not, and the lava apparently drained out of it. The colors on the walls and lava shapes are beautiful beyond description. The 2 mile walk to the crater gives an appreciation of the surrounding topography. I have heard  that there has been talk of drilling a hole in the side of the volcano to allow more direct access for more people. Hopefully that will never happen, as it would degrade the experience, not to mention permanently deface this unique volcano. As it currently operates, there is limited capacity. Hopefully, it will remain that way. This will be a high point of any Iceland vacation."
Great place to visit!,"I have to say it is a must done trip when you are planning your stay on Iceland. Amazing place, amazimg guides!!!"
A Singular Experience,"In the world today, advertisements and testimonials use every superlative word to sell one thing or another.  Hyperbole and exaggeration are commonplace.  So we become jaded. But there is nothing to sell here.There is just the opportunity for a singular experience on this planet.All of the rave reviews for this volcano pale in comparison to the beauty and grandeur that meet your eyes.Believe them."
Experience of a lifetime,"Wow wow wow, what an absolutely exhilarating experience.  My husband booked this as a special treat for our wedding anniversary.  The day we were supposed to go was cancelled due to weather conditions , but we were accommodated on a later date.  The walk across the lava field was led by Alexia who was lovely and took very great care of a young girl on our tour as it was very cold.  It was a little hairy to say the least due to snow and driving winds, I think I now know how arctic explorers feel as the visibility was sketchy at times.  At base camp a very warm welcome awaited by T, the basecamp manager who is charming, witty and funny.  He will no doubt soon get his own show.  The last few minutes hike up to the opening of the volcano is very exhilarating and safety is paramount.  The descent into the chamber is surreal and the trip of a lifetime.  You get a decent amount of time in the volcano to explore and take pictures before ascending back to base camp to T and his amazing meat soup.  He makes the best soup I’ve had in Iceland in all the years I have been visiting.  Yes this is expensive, however nothing is cheap in Iceland and it’s well worth it,  the trip of a lifetime, run by professional staff who really make the experience even more enjoyable if that’s possible. I would suggest taking waterproofs and wearing good footwear as a minimum.  If you don’t need waterproofs great, but you will be glad you had them if you do.  Just do it!"
"2nd time i go there, def not the last! <3","Ok so this is one of the coolest outdoor activity to do near Reykjavik and a once in a lifetime experience.Get yourself inside the lava chamber of the volcano and admire the magnificent colors  on the chamber walls.Definitely take some waterproof shoes and pants if you go in fall/winter. My 11yo daughter and I didn't and spent a few hours soaking wet at -4 degrees. Memorable experience :)The guides are super friendly. Alexia our guide was awesome and so kind to lend us some of her own clothes.Mister T's islander soup is to die for. Thanks for the chocolate too mate ;-)5***** activity, hands down"
Awesome experience,I can strongly recommend this excursion to everyone who wants to enjoy little adrenaline activity! You will appear in another world 120 meters below the Earth surface
WOW,"WOW.  This was on my list for a 3 day visit to Iceland.  Truly it is an amazing experience.  1 hour hike up to base camp through snowy lava fields.  Jaw dropping decent into a dormant lava chamber.  Great hosts.  Super professional.  Totally brilliant morning.The watchout is the weather.  We were due to go on Saturday - cancelled, rebooked to Sunday - cancelled, rebooked to Monday - brilliant.Worth the wait - but it’s cold and unpredictable in Iceland in October - so be prepared....Worth it 100%"
"Excellent, despite the weather...","Like the other reviews, being inside the volcano was exhilarating and highly recommended.  However, I can only look with envy on the people that had a pleasant hike to the volcano.  Don't get the wrong; I'd go on the tour to see the volcano once more but only if the weather was better...lol.  However, the weather was something to prepare for.  The weather that morning was forecast for light rain and was supposed to be windy (which seems to be the norm for Iceland, haha).  By the time we arrived at the start of the trail there were high winds and light rain.  Tip:  when they say use their rain gear USE their rain gear.)  There were high constant winds on the whole trek up there as well as lots of rain.  Fortunately, it was all coming from the back of us so it wasn't too bad.  Despite the rain gear I had and their rain gear my lower half and boots were soaked.At the top was another building where you could warm up/dry off and where you would receive the briefing on what to expect.  Heavy snow up at the top which was cool.  The last 5 minute ascent was highly windy requiring you to grab onto a rope railing set into the stone.As for the descent and exploration -- it was very, very cool!  The temps in the cavern didn't bother me because I was out of the wind and rain.  I can highly recommend seeing the inside - it's an experience you won't want to miss and well worth the price.Going back down was terrible since you had everything from ice flecks (top) to rain and wind literally pummeling you on the way back down to the second building (I had to grip the rope rail with a death grip while shielding my eyes from the ice flecks with my other gloved hand).  After a short respite there you start your way back down the trail.  I had my coat, rain gear and their rain gear on and was so glad that I had brought my hat along since the brim shielded my eyes from the constant rain and wind that blew towards us.  Visibility was about a 1/4 mile or less at best since there was a heavy mist that shrouded everything.  By the time we reached the bottom we were all tired and soaked.  In all, the weather reminded me of what the Arctic explorers must have faced in their explorations although they were a lot colder than I was!   We met a Icelandic couple at the bottom who were taking their young child to the volcano and I thought they were crazy even though the adults are probably used to such conditions.Bottom line:  bring your own rain gear as a precaution and enjoy the experience.  I would definitely go again if the weather was better, haha!"
Lovely walk through the snow was an added bonus !,"Other people have waxed eloquent, so read their reviews.  We are in our late 70's, and had no difficulty (maybe it's easier in snow, going along a track that others have made, rather than contending with the lava field)."
Amazing once in a lifetime experience,This was by far the best thing we did while in Iceland. It will be an experience that is never forgotten. The whole staff from the tour guides to base camp workers were all so friendly and easygoing. Also- the soup was sooooo good and perfect for after the walk to the base camp closest to the volcano.
Bucket list satisfied,"There are very few experiences you can do that make you feel truly small (usually you’re trying to achieve the opposite effect). Walking the floor of a dormant volcano, 700 feet down into the earth is one of those experiences. The colors are even more beautiful when you’re standing in front of them. What pictures can’t convey is the sheer size of the cavern, the feeling of being present in something ancient, and a quiet wonder. The cavern floor has been preserved in its natural state, so hiking shoes and a willingness to be slightly uncomfortable is a must. Expensive? Yes. Glad we did it? Absolutely."
Great experience! Loved the staff❤,"My dad and I did this together and loved it! The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly, especially Markus and our guide, Brindi (probably misspelled). The day before we were scheduled for our trip, I received an email saying they were calling for bad weather and the trip most likely would be cancelled but they said they could accommodate us the day before or after. I only had 1.5 days left in Iceland before I flew home but I talked to Markus and he was able to fit us in that very same day, which was AWESOME because I really wanted this experience! Also I requested walking sticks for my dad (who is in his 70s) and Markus was able to provide walking sticks on super short notice. Thank you, Markus! During our hike to the volcano, Brindi, our guide, was FANTASTIC! She had a friendly, fun and cheerful attitude which made for a fun experience and kept us laughing. She would take short breaks (which my dad appreciated) while we were hiking and explain things about the volcanoes and our surroundings. When we got down into the volcano and we realized my dad's headlamp was broken, she even gave him hers. She is definitely an asset to your team and added to our experience. Loved her! She's wonderful!After we finished going into the volcano, we came back to their base camp where they have prepared a giant pot of hot, delicious, Icelandic meat soup and vegetable soup, which definitely warmed us up before our hike back in the snow. Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend Inside the Volcano to any and all people considering visiting Iceland. How often are you going to get the chance to see a volcano from the inside?!?! It was VERY COOL!!!"
Really cool but a little bit expensive for young’s.,"Better than we expected, but if it didn’t have big snow before we go and the snow cover the whole way we walk, my wife might kill me just on the half way haha!"
Once (twice if you've got the money) in a lifetime experience.,This is the only place on the planet where you can step inside a volcano. If that's not enough for you then go see it for yourselves and it will be.
Absolutely Incredible-- Bucket List!,"This is THE ONLY place in the world where you have an opportunity to go into a magma chamber of a volcano. That right there is reason enough to go on this tour, but even more so, you will leave in awe. It's expensive, but so is every other tour in Iceland. It's extremely well executed and all of the staff are very professional. Note that there is a 3km walk each way to reach the volcano. The trek is not hard, but it's through an open lava field. We were freezing. Pack warm, waterproof clothing. Some people have complained about only spending 30 minutes inside the volcano-- this is ample time to walk around, get some good photos, and ask the guides any questions you may have. Any longer would have just seemed like we were standing around looking for something to do. The colors of the rocks and the different levels/formations is absolutely unreal. Just to think about what was happening right where you were standing 4,000 years ago is mindblowing. You will not be sorry you did this."
Mind blowing experience,"Expensive tour but a mind blowing experience. From the pictures it look like a bunch of rocks but u have to descend into the volcano to experience it. Very cold so make sure you are dress warmly and waterproof. The hot lamb soup which they served us after the tour was apt, thoughtful and delicious. I had a second helping!"
"Incredible tour, great company","This was such a great experience! We had a hiccup at the beginning of our tour (our fault), but we called the company and they were INCREDIBLY accommodating and we didn't end up missing out on anything. They went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great tour. We hiked in right after a snowfall, but they had made tracks in the snow and it wasn't difficult overall. The scenery was breathtaking. It was about a 40 minute hike to the volcano. The soup they provide after the tour is delicious as well! I would definitely recommend this tour and this company."
Amazing feeling and a great experience,"Even if it is overpriced just go, you do not have another place to experience such a trip.The staff goes extra mile for you.  Use their shuttle instead the car, it is easier to reach the top.The hiking is not difficult but depends of the weather. Reaching the bottom inside the volcano  is something… you will become a geologist and an adventurer.You will have nice memories for life a time, life is  to enjoy not to count money."
NO WORDS ...,"... which is meant in the best possible way you can imagine. Despite the fact that this tour is quite pricey all I can say is that it is money more than well spent and worth every single penny ... or krona. It is super professionally operated, more than well organized and comes with the feeling of really discovering a new world and pushing these limits (in a world where everyone can have everything within no time) just that tiny little bit. If you are in doubt go for it and you wont regret it. And take in every single minute as this is a once in a lifetime chance to get to one of the most remote places in the world. (As a bonus I got to enjoy a nice hike in fresh snow which added up to the overall great experience and made me even happier. :-) )"
Once in a lifetime experience,"How many can say they have been inside the magma chamber of a volcano? This is a really unique experience. They have a shuttle that picks you up in Reykjavik or you can opt to drive their yourself. From the meeting point, it's about a 1.8 mile (3km) hike to base camp where they will prepare you to go down into the volcano. The hike is relatively easy if you are able to walk for long periods of time but can get difficult during the colder months. I just went a few days ago (beginning of October) and there was a massive amount of snow, it was very windy and some ice. They dug a track for you to walk along and there's a guide that leads the way but it was a pretty grueling hike. Wearing proper attire will help a lot. I saw people that came in sweatpants and low cut sneakers and they really struggled. They have some waterproof coats and ice traction cleats that you can use if you need it. I highly recommend wearing warm water resistant pants and some high-top hiking shoes or boats. The elevator down is mostly slow and steading. As a person that is not good with heights, I found it to be very easy. Once down, you will be in complete awe, it's absolutely beautiful. You are rewarded with some traditional lamb or veggie soup once back up."
Amazing hike and decent into the past,"We booked this tour at our hotel after it being recommended by our receptionist, we were intially worries about the price but BOY was it worth it. It was really out of this world to decend into a volcano ( the only one if its kind in the world). Don’t miss this attraction, its more than worth it!"
Breathtaking experience for the rest of life,"This is really one of the best places to visit in Iceland and it is not far from Reykjavik. The buss picked me up at the Gray Line Bus Terminal and after around 1 hour we started to walk 3 km one way to the entry of the Volcano. It was snowy,stormy weather, sometimes icy rain, but all together I enjoyed even a walk because I had prepared myself. Clothes are very important for the walk. Going down in the belly of the Earth (Volcano) was one of the best experiences as a travel agent and a nature lover can acquire in the life. I am keen on volcanoes and to experience myself deeply in the centre of the Volcano was incredible, amazing, breathtaking, inspiring, surprising. It was far away from my imgaination that the crust of the Earth can be so colourful and vivid. I am thankful for everyone who helped me to get this experience. For sure, it is for the rest of my life! Really worth to visit!"
"Very Nice Tour,But Overpriced.","Everything in Iceland is expensive, but $360 per person for a 1/2 hour in a 75-yard-wide cave is a bit steep. We had to walk, in a snowstorm, for an hour, just to get there. The cavern is beautiful and the staff were fantastic. They went above beyond. But, whoever owns this is rich."
Amazing experience!!,"My daughter picked this tour on our vacation and I was so glad she did. It was incredible. The attention from staff even before the tour was incredible. They were diligent with communication re road conditions so that we could safely get to our meeting spot. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. In mid October, the grounds were already packed with snow (and it was snowing when we ventured out on the hike to base camp). The hike was a good workout. Not easy for anyone not in shape. Definitely needed waterproof warm weather boots. I also thought the homemade soup served at base camp made the whole experience feel so authentic to Iceland. I was also worried that I might feel claustrophobic but the area inside the volcano is very open and wide at base. Would highly recommend this one of a kind unique experience. Worth the price!!!"
IG worthy,This is one of those things that you have to try for the sake of trying it. Where else can you have an opportunity to do something like this?!? It was a great experience and I’m so glad I did it. I must say that my actual enjoyment came from the hike itself as well as the elevator ride. Once you’re inside it’s fun for about 10 min or so. It’s not very big so you’ll see everything you need to see in less than the allotted time. Just do it. It’s really a cool story to tell :)
Totally worth the money.,"My husband and I are not wealthy, so this excursion was 1/4 of our entire trip expenses - and still, it was worth it. Our guide was humble, knowledgeable, patient, easy-going, and professional, and everyone made us feel safe and welcome. The volcano itself is, to say the least, breathtaking and quite a unique experience. Difficult to describe how special it is that they offer this trip."
Inside The Volcano,Beautiful and exhilarating this is not to be missed.  The guides were the best I experienced in Iceland.  Very personable and accommodating.
Amazing Experience!!,"We had a fantastic time on this tour! The guides were kind and knowledgeable.  The colors inside the volcano were unbelievable and the views on the hike there were magnificent.  We are so glad we did this tour, it’s 100% worth the price!"
Epic,"Despite the cost, it was one of the coolest experiences of my life.  Worth every pennie.  Guides are great, lunch is amazing.  I would recommend this tour to anyone."
Thrilling,"The promo movie does not over promise. This was a truly mind blowing experience. If you go in October, be prepared with sturdy hiking books and your warmest, waterproof outerwear."
An Eye-opening Experience,"While descending into the dormant Thrihnukagigur volcano, my heart was pounding with excitement. And it’s so amazing to be surrounded by different colours and shapes of rocks that were formed about 4500 years ago. The stunning journey is actually not limited to visiting the inside of the volcano, but also outside. We walked on a path through the lava field and crossed between the North America and European tectonic plates when heading to Thrihnukagigur. It’s tranquil and beautiful. Thanks to the professional guides and the entire team for giving me this unique and eye-opening experience!"
Once in a lifetime experience!,"This was our ""big spend"" on our trip to Iceland, which for the prices of everything over there, says a lot! You meet in a ski lodge until everyone is there and the shuttles arrive. We drove ourselves, since we were not coming from Reykjavik. When everyone is there, you start the hike across the lava field, which is beautiful. It's a pretty easy hike but definitely rocky and open to the elements, so dress for the weather! You stop at base camp and they gear you up with a helmet/headlamp (check yours before you leave the camp - it should be 3 clicks to get brighter and that makes a big difference in there, my brightest light didn't work). You warm up with tea or hot chocolate and get all the gear on before walking up to the top. The descent on the ""dumbwaiter"" was beautiful and we got about 30 minutes with just our group of 7 in the magma chamber before the next group came down. It is quite a climb over rocks and such down in there, so wear sturdy boots if you want to walk to whole ring around the inside. Then back down to base camp where you can enjoy one bowl of meat or vegetable soup and tea/hot chocolate one last time. There is a wall of t-shirts and sweatshirts with the logo for sale, no one pushed sales at ALL, everything was pretty pricey. There was a toddler arctic fox running around base camp that the staff apparently feeds but they're expecting him to move on shortly. Still pretty cool to see. Then it was at our own pace back to the car since we did not need the shuttle back to town. Beautiful and humbling to be inside the MAGMA chamber of a volcano! No where else in the world (known) that you can do that!"
Absolutely awesome!,"Wow! This is a must do experience.We left this to our last day in Iceland, it was fabulous. We had a perfect day weather wise so the walk across the lava fields was easy. Our guide was T, he was full of information and didn't keep us standing in the cold for long. The elevator down into the volcano was quite peaceful. Then once down in the chamber, we were able to walk around. T began to sing and it just made the experience so wonderful. The acoustics were better than any cathedral. Thanks T for an awesome day."
Worth it,"If spending the money money means you won't be able to do anything else this trip, maybe skip it, but if money isn't a concern or it means buying pasta to make are your hotel for night or two of the trip instead of going out, this is totally worth it.  Given the hefty price I was worried I might be a bit disappointed, but nope, the experience is totally surreal and there isn't anywhere else you can get an experience like this.  They do a good job of making the experience seem longer and worth it, and the soup of delicious!Do make sure you dress warmly.  There is little to break up the wind for the hike across the lava fields and it definitely can get chilly if you don't have a few layers and a hat/gloves. Book in advance!"
A Once in a Lifetime Experience,"The Inside the Volcano tour was amazing!  The extremely knowledgeable guides could not have been nicer and more helpful.  The 2 mile hike was definitely not too difficult, and there was a guide in the front of the pack of about 20 people and one in the rear, so you could pretty much do it at your own pace.  I would, however, suggest rain gear as the weather changed every 15 minutes and I was quite wet by the time we arrived at the base camp.  Everything at the base camp was efficient and organized as they broke us into groups of 6 for our descent and provided us with the necessary safety gear.  The 30 minutes in the volcano itself was fantastic -- a huge chamber of beautiful colors and rock formations.  There was plenty of time to climb among the rocks and take all the pictures we wanted.  Afterwards they served us delicious traditional lamb soup.  The hike back was at your own pace.  This tour is pricey, but it's definitely an experience you will never forget."
Amazing Tour,"The tour was fantastic and worth the money.  The time in the volcano is only 30 minutes, but it is amazing to see the wonder mother nature created."
Impactful and exciting experience!,"The volcano experience was one that I will never forget.  The guides were informative and very friendly.  The views were beyond incredible.  The walk to the volcano is about 40 minutes, but it was very low impact.  It was windy, so I would advise wearing warm clothes.The time inside the volcano was like nothing I've ever experienced, and it is very worth your time and money.  It is an absolute MUST during your trip to Iceland!"
"WOW, Inside the Volcano!!",This was amazing! I wasn't expecting what we saw! The guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. I would suggest this adventure
Very unique experience!,"Overall, we really enjoyed this tour! The hike up to the volcano was a little difficult and the guides walk at a fast pace (stopping twice throughout the hike to provide details about the volcano), but it's manageable. Being lowered down into the magma chamber is cool in itself, but to look around at the bottom is simply amazing. I would recommend this tour!"
Not to be missed!!,What an amazing journey inside a volcano!  It was so much more than we wished for!  Nature at it's best.  Guides were great and very helpful.  A must do when visiting Iceland!!
"Don't think about it, JUST GO","What could be more incredible, more unique, more inspiring than going inside a volcano?Put this at the top of your list of amazing, one-of-a-kind experiences than you can only do in the extraordinary country of Iceland!You'll start off with a 45 minute hike across a stunning lava field before arriving at the base camp near the volcano.After relaxing at base camp and getting the intro, you'll soon find yourself on a small elevator making the descent into the dormant volcano.  Seriously, this is a can't miss, once-in-a-lifetime kind of adventure.  Also included in the trip are commemorative scarves, delicious soup and your team of warm, professional and highly knowledgable guides.Arguably worth a trip to Iceland just to do this, but of course, there are a thousand reasons to go to Iceland.  But make sure this is one of them!"
Once in a lifetime experience!,"Our experience started with a 1.5 mile hike across the lava fields to the base camp where we were given the safety lecture, given helmets and harnesses, and divided into small groups. After a short hike to the top, we were tethered to and crossed a small bridge that spanned the opening of the volcano and led to a small, metal-cage lift. Our guide and lift operator were both very knowledgeable and explained the geological history that was unfolding on the magma chamber walls. It was fascinating to see the sites of volcanic events. And even more exciting to be left at the bottom to traverse the area on our own. We were given about 30 minutes before boarding the lift to the top. Afterward, our lovely basecamp managers fed us some delicious and traditional lamb soup.  Yes, This was expensive, but when can you ever say you traveled to the bottom of a volcano? Breathtaking!"
Simply wow!,"Well worth the 3k hike to get to the volcano and back. Beautiful scenery en route.  All the guides were excellent - very informative and helpful. Words cannot describe the scale of the size of the magma chamber and you have to see it with your own eyes. Hilmir, our main guide, even sang a beautiful lullaby lament in the magma chamber - it was so moving. The soup before the return hike was delicious. The visit was just wonderful and well worth the expense."
A fantastic trip,"As a photographer this trip is fantastic, what a surreal and unique experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different."
Great experience,"This is really fun and worth doing- if you can pay the $375 price tag. I really enjoyed it and thought it was worth the cost. They tell you it's the only volcano in the world you can enter the magma chamber. Basically it's in the mountains outside Reykjavik (you can take a shuttle there or drive there). A guide will lead a group of 20 at a time to the volcano. It's a 1-hour hike that's really easy and mostly on flat ground (there's a 5-minute stretch at the end that's uphill). There's a small base camp where they give you coffee and water while you wait to descend into the volcano in groups of 6-7 (you may have to wait a bit while other groups go down). They fit you with a harness and helmet and take you down in a lift. It's really beautiful down there- well lit with lamps and you can walk around freely. You have 30 minutes to explore and take photos before they bring you back up. When you get back up, they'll give you a traditional Icelandic soup at base camp, then you're free to make the 1-hour hike back at your own pace. The guide was super friendly and told us a lot of interesting information.I loved it- it was really beautiful and a once in a lifetime experience. Pricey, yes- but I'm glad I did it."
The most unique trip in Iceland,"Inside the Volcano was amazing. If you think you know what this will be like you are wrong. A must see and worth the money!! Plus all of the staff are very knowledgable, fun, safe, and make a great lamb soup!"
Simply Amazing and the Very Best service,"From the booking to the end of the trip was outstanding service.  They are just great dealing with you.  We had a person that had a sore foot and we were not sure we could make it.  They were flexible with letting us book and unbook the person. The guides are friendly and fun to be with.We were contacted a couple of days before the trip saying they anticipated very poor weather on the day of our trip and suggested that we move it forward one day.  We were able to do that and instead of getting poor conditions on the actual booked day we had a beautiful day with sunshine and low winds.  Thanks to this proactive management of their booking we had an awesome day.The experience itself was amazing. A nice walk/hike to volcano at a fairly brisk pace but they did slow down if someone was going a bit slower.  The building near the volcano entrance is very comfortable. All the equipment used is in excellent condition and they are very concerned about safety.  They make sure the equipment is on properly and all safety latches are handled properly.  Inside the volcano is simply awe striking.  One of the best ""tours"" we have ever done. And great soup after coming out of volcano."
Amazing colours ,"It is certainly a once in a life time experience, but very expensive. I’m not sure how the cost is justified, but if you can afford it, do it!! A 45 minute walk over a generally very easy trail across the lava fields, a warm drink, a quick briefing, then the fabulous journey down the mouth of the volcano. The 30 minutes or so at the bottom does go quickly but  it’s enough time to walk around the circuit and take amazing pics and wonder at the beauty and the colours Mother Nature can throw up.A bowl of tasty soup awaits after your ascension, then the hike back to the bus. The girls at the base camp were so amazing and they clearly love their job!!Keep an eye out for Arctic foxes, like this little guy."
An amazing experience,"From pick up to return everything went smoothly. The activity was very well organised and involved a group of about 18 people split into three groups to enter the volcano. The hike from the parking area to the volcano was easy and interesting. Base camp supplied us with food and drinks before and after our journey into the volcano. The journey down and up as well as wandering around inside the volcano was amazing. All the staff except for one girl were friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. Safety was very important.  I would highly recommend this activity."
Worth the hike!,"Cool tour! We decided to drive ourselves instead of getting picked up at our hotel so we would not have to wait on others once the tour was done. The roads are very well paved in Reykjavic and the drive was easy to get to. If you are renting a car, its worth adding the car wifi..this saved us! Once there, the hike to the volcano over a lava field was long, but beautiful (maybe 30-45 min). There is a nice base camp you suit up at with restrooms, hot coffee, tea, and soup that the guides make themselves."
Amazing,"very good experience but quite expensive. However, I believe that this is a unique experience inside the volcano."
Once in a lifetime experience,"The tour operators have done a great job of setting things up so that they are safe for the general public, but keeping it natural enough to feel like you're on an adventure few have made. As you descend into the chamber and the light slowly illuminates down to the floor, the excitement (and maybe a little terror for those of us afraid of heights) is something truly remarkable. Bonus the soup at the end is delicious and the base camp employees are so welcoming (including an arctic fox orphan that was adopted by them; cutest little guy ever!)."
Amazing but VERY expensive,"Overall we had a great day. Hike was easy, guide was super friendly and knowlagable and the volcano is stunning... But even by Icelandic standards I think it is grossly overpriced."
Go for it!  Truly worth it!,"Incredible tour inside a dormant volcano that erupted 4500 years ago. Two mile moderate walk from starting point to base camp for instructions, helmets & harness.  Then a short (a bit steep) walk up to the top and onto the  lift which brings you to the bottom of  the volcano.  Amazing amazing to see the colorful lava formations.   Our guide, Hilmer was outstanding!  He was very personable and cared about your safety & comfort.  After your journey to the center of the volcano, base camp provides some delicious soup, coffee or water.  Open til end of October."
Unbelievable!,Great experience. My husband loved it !  We were with 2 guides the entire time.  My husband had broken a rib the day before and the guides were very accommodating.  We were able to participate in the entire tour.  The volcano is surreal once you are inside.  The way up there is absolutely beautiful.  Great experience.  Highlight of our trip !
An experience like no other,"Just an amazing experience like no other. It starts with a real friendly staff and the hike to to volcano just builds up the anticipation. Once down in the volcano we got to have around 45 min to take pictures. Being solo the tour guide was nice enough to take some pictures of me inside. To finish off the tour you get some delicious Icelandic meat soup.It's expensive but worth every cent, highly highly recommend it. Made this Canadian's experience unforgettable. Thank you to the Inside the Volcano team."
Amaizing! ,The tour is truly amaizing. You have to walk 40-50 min in a nice Path the views are amaizing! The y have a cabin close to the volcano with wc and a nice hot soup after the volcano visit. You will spend 30 minutes inside the volcano. Illumination is perfect and everything is very safe! Soup was great! Tour is about 4 hours long! Really worth it
Awesomeness,This was the most amazing experience.  T was a great guide and I was so impressed with the entire experience.
Worth it,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience. The staff was friendly. The weather was wonderful for us. We had about 45 minutes in the volcano and it was just awe inspiring. It's expensive, yes, but a once in a lifetime experience."
Inside the Volcano Was Fabulous!!!! Chance of a lifetime!!,So glad I spent the money to do this adventure as you can only do this in Iceland. And it was so cool and worth every cent!!  The beauty inside is spiritual and the colors are truly amazing it’s like being in a natural made basilica at some points. Very moving. And mind blowing too.  Must do in Iceland.
Worthy Splurge!,We thoroughly enjoyed our trip Inside the Volcano! The guides and staff were excellent. The beauty inside is hard to describe and something not to be missed on a trip to Iceland.
Inside the Volcano,"Great tour, very friendly and knowledgeable guides, definitely recommend the experience, the hike to the base of the volcano is flat and easy."
Amazing adventure,"Highly recommended! Tour was amazing & made my trip:) guide was awesome, organization is higher than expected! Absolutely breathtaking views ❤️"
Warmer inside than outside the vulcano,"It was truly a unique experience. The whether was really bad. We got rain jackets from the tour operator but I highly recommend to bring /wear rainprove and warm clothes. You walk 40 min to the base camp and if it is rainy and windy, you will not find any shelter before the base camp. The colors inside the vulcano are incredible and it is about the temperature of your fridge (any time of year)."
Unique experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed this tour and it was a truly unique experience to go inside the volcano.We had miserable wet & windy weather on the walk out to the volcano and ended up with wet jeans and wet feet as well.  However with the brief warm up at base camp we were set for the descent into the volcano.The colours and rock formations were amazing to see and it was beautifully quiet.We thoroughly enjoyed the lamb soup afterwards to warm up and prepare us for the walk back.  This time into the wind and luckily there was only a little rain.The walking paths are excellent and the last steep bit up to the volcano entrance was not too bad at all.Definitely recommend this tour, just make sure you have really good wet weather gear!!"
Amazing,"What an incredible experience. The weather was wonderful, nice & sunny so the hike was very enjoyable. The crew were extremely friendly & explained all information. Once inside, it was just beautiful. We were treated with a Icelandic lullaby from our guide. It was just a very special experience. Homemade soup was delicious also."
"Fascinating, but oh so expensive","Really unique, fascinating, amazing.  A wonderful experience inside the volcano.  Others have explained it well.  I would say that the walk is fairly long, but mostly level, so not particularly strenuous, although our guide set a pretty ambitious pace.  We were offered raincoats, if we wanted them, because there was a threat of rain.  It is pretty cool inside the volcano itself.  I would suggest that if you have your own car, you should drive yourself to the location.  Taking the bus adds a lot of wasted time on either end.  Having your own car also allows you to depart early from base camp, if you want, rather than having to wait until the whole group is ready to go."
Unique experience,"Yes its got quite a price-tag but if you can afford it - do it. We both agreed that not only was it worth every penny but we would do it again. This is the only intact magma chamber on planet earth. the hike is not as bad as it was made out to be - it is not a stroll in the park but it is not mountain hiking either. Be sure to have waterproof clothing as it gets quite wet on the hike. We were in a camper and drove ourselves - we had no trouble finding the place - put inside the volcano into google maps - takes you straight there. We had the added bonus of seeing the 5 month old arctic fox that lives near base camp. We also did the extra little walk from base camp to see the troll eggs. They provide helmets with headlamps, climbing harnesses and waterproofs if required. There was plentiful tea, coffee, water and soup. Would have liked some bread with the soup but that's just me. This was a once in a lifetime experience unique on planet earth. Do it!"
Well organized/planned,"The trip was well organized and we got the experience we were hoping for. Going down into the chamber was thrilling, amazing, a one-of-kind experience. The tour guide was knowledgeable about the history and science of this rarity. The soup provided (vegetarian/vegan or lamb) was awesome - very well seasoned."
RealAdventure,"Inside the volcano was a fascinating experience.  But this tour was a real adventure on August 30, 2018, hiking 2 miles in perhaps the worst weather, we have experience, very high wind and rain contributed to unexpected wind chill.  The wind easily caused many in the tour group to stumble.  The Arctic Adventure tour guides, were amazing and exceptionally professional in ensuring everyone's safety.  This tour is a must.  Thanks, Arctic Adventures!!"
Super experience,"Ok, it is not cheap but from the moment we arrived we were well looked after. Free coffee at the meeting point, after an easy hike of 2-3kms we were introduced to the basecamp team, who gave us a safety chat & gave us our equipment. Then we were lead to the lift and lowered into the volcano. Plenty of time was given to allow us to take in the awesomeness of the volcano. Then back to the surface and great homemade soup before the hike back to the meeting point."
Amazing experience!,"It's a rare chance to see the inside of volcano, which is super amazing. I rated 4 stars rather than 5 stars only because it's kind of expensive. You might want to take your budget into consideration. Also, it's not an easy trail. There are some huge rocks and cliffs inside the volcano. If you are going with your children or parents, you might want to think about it."
there is only one in the world,this is the only place in the world where you can visit the interior of a volcano. it is well organized and you have plenty of time to wonder in the interior. And they also serve an excellent soup! for the energies required for the long hike back to your transportation.
Worth the money for a unique experience,"My husband and I decided to spend the money on this experience as we are here on our Honeymoon and wanted to do something special, and we are glad we did. While it is not cheap, the whole day was great and an amazing experience we won't forget. We found the meeting point easily following the directions given on the website. While we waited for the others to arrive we had free coffee in the warm waiting room. When we were all ready our guide introduced herself and explained what to expect from the trip. Then it was a brisk but easy hike over the lave field to the base camp stopping a few times on the way to point things out. At base camp there was more coffee and water available, and toilets (long drop). We were split into 2 groups to descent into the volcano. It's a quick walk up to the top of the volcano where you get into the lift and are lowered down. I thought I'd be scared, but you are clipped in, and it felt very safe, I just didn't look down into the abyss! At the bottom our guide met us and explained a bit more, then we were free to explore round the chamber which was well lit for about 30 minutes. It was incredible seeing a volcano from the inside, and our guide was very knowledgeable and happy to chat and answer questions. Once back up at Base Camp we tucked into the hot soup which was welcome as cold in the volcano. At that point you're free to make your own way back to the meeting point whenever you want, but we waited to walk back with our guide and the rest of the group. Not far from the road our guide pointed out a lava tunnel and as we had our own transport and so not time restricted we clambered down into the tunnel and through it for a short way which was an added bonus to the whole experience. Overall a great day out and impressed by the professionalism throughout."
An excellent experience,"This is a unique and fascinating experience. There is plentiful parking at the meeting point, which is based at a ski centre. Hot drinks and water are provided at this point and toilets are available. Once everyone arrives, your informative guide explains how the tour works and you are then kitted out in large, bright yellow rubber coats (we arrived in heavy wind and rain so not sure whether you also wear these in good weather). Unfortunately, you are not provided with any footwear (unlike the Into the Glacier tour where waterproof over boots are provided) so by the end of the activity our footwear was saturated and everyone was wringing out their socks and various other items of clothing! I would strongly recommend wearing quick drying trousers if attempting this in bad weather. You then hike to the Thrihnukagigur volcano, following a path through the lava fields. This is well-marked but a little uneven in places so I would also recommend wearing sturdy shoes. The walk is roughly 2 miles in each direction and is normally completed at a gentle pace of up to 40 – 50 minutes, with pauses for the guide to explain points of interest en route. Unfortunately the weather was too bad to stop so we walked without pausing which was quite tough in the strong wind. Once at the volcano you are taken into a cosy cabin where hot drinks are provided and there are toilets in a neighbouring building. We were lucky enough to see an orphaned arctic fox which they are looking after – apparently this is the only native land mammal in Iceland. At the base camp you are given a safety briefing by the friendly staff and are then split into smaller groups of about 8 people. You are provided with a bandana (which you keep as a souvenir); this lines a helmet (partially provided to protect you from the potential of falling mobile phones as people are lowered in above you!) and a rock climbing harness. They have sufficient varieties to cater for all shapes and sizes of people.  When your group is called you complete the hike to the top of the crater on a partly roped path. From here you are clipped to a walkway and then to the ‘window cleaner’s cradle’ which lowers you 400 feet to the bottom of the chamber. I am afraid of heights but fascinated by volcanoes so really wanted to do this despite feeling very nervous. Thankfully I was able to stand in the corner of the cradle so was able to hold onto both an upright and horizontal bar which enabled me to feel more secure. Whilst everyone else was looking side to side, up and down, I just looked straight ahead – still able to enjoy the vast range of colours and different rock formations passing before my eyes.  The magma chamber widens as you get lower and whilst in the narrowest part there is some slight movement of the cradle as it passes the rock, this was momentary and the rest of the descent was very smooth. The journey down is meant to take 6 minutes but it didn’t feel that long and I felt more confident on the return journey, knowing what to expect. Once at the bottom, the guide provides you with relevant information about the history and formation of the volcano, pointing out its various features and you are then free to explore. Your helmet has a head torch which helps with illumination. There is a path of sorts around the chamber – it is up and down and rather rough with boulders but there is a rope around the edge. You get about 30 minutes at the base which is enough to take it all in, take photographs and pinch yourself while you realise you are standing at the base of a magma chamber – apparently in the only place in the world where you can do this. Once back at the cabin, there is a choice of hot drinks and either meat or vegetarian soup. We chose the latter and it was delicious – especially appreciated in such awful weather. This gives you the chance to chat with other people who have shared your experience, while waiting for the other groups to have their turn. There is a range of affordable souvenirs to buy – for example a T shirt at ISK2000 which was the cheapest T shirt by far which we saw during our whole holiday. Ideally you need your credit card on you to pay but if you don’t have it, they allow you to pay once you have returned back to the ski centre. Our walk back was horrendous because of the awful weather with the wind now hitting us directly in the face but a guide walks at both the front and back of the line so you are well looked after. It was a great relief to return to the centre and change into dry clothes! Throughout the whole experience the staff were friendly, kind and patient. This is an expensive activity but we learnt that everything that is at the base camp has to be flown in and flown out (including toilet waste!) to avoid damaging the sensitive environment. This undoubtedly contributes towards the cost. Ultimately I have had an amazing and unique experience which I will remember and treasure for a long time to come so I feel it is worth every penny!"
Breathtaking and way better than expected,"Amazing experience and one of the highlights of our trip.  If you have a chance to see this volcano, you should definitely do it.  It was a well run tour, and a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  The volcano is immense inside and it's an incredible ride to the bottom and back up again.  I think this is the only defunct volcano in the world that you can go inside, so treat yourself while in Iceland!"
Great adventure,This was a wonderful experience.  I was not sure what to expect and still hard to explain the experience and do it any justice.  Pictures just dont give you the same feeling and understanding as being on the floor of the chamber.  Thought it was expensive but it is a once in a life time experience and glad that I took it.  Pickup and drop off is managed great and all of the drivers and guides were excellent.  Highly recommend.
"WORTH IT, WORTH IT, WORTH IT","Great day, the guides were great, very helpful and friendly.  To be in such an amazing natural beauty is a once in a lifetime event.   While there is clearly a decent cost to go, it is just one of those things that is worth it.   It is incredible to see inside and view the enormous spectacle.  The hike is not that bad, the staff great and got to play with a resident young fox.  A MUST SEE!"
Inside volcano,Description met expectations.  Staff very friendly and knowledgeable.  Nice thought to provide homemade soup and hot beverages.Highly recommend as a to do in Iceland
Best tour ever!!!,"This tour was, unquestionably, the most awe inspiring experience we have had to date. Worth every last penny, and probably even more. The staff were friendly, hospitable, and accommodating every step of the way. The hike to the volcano was not overly difficult and had it been three times longer would still have been worth it. If you go to Iceland and do not take this tour, you are doing it wrong."
Great experience,This was one of three excursions that my boyfriend and I chose for our week in Iceland and it didn’t disappoint.
Great experience!,You have to pay a lot of money but the experience is really great! It's the unique volcano in the world you can enter inside. The guides are very kind.
fascinating adventure into almost-dormant volcano,"Although it was pretty pricy, the chance to visit a lava chamber and view all of the different minerals and colors was fascinating.  Guides were excellent, practiced good safety.  The hike up to the volcano was not hard, and the guides prepared us"
Fun!,"This was a unique and educational experience.  Started with an easy hike to the volcano.  Enjoyed getting out and being active, but it was not a hard hike.  Once at the volcano, they send you down the elevator in shifts.  It was not scary (but if you are really afraid of heights it might be difficult for you).  It was amazing to be inside a real volcano, got a brief education from the guides.  The guides were also happy to take family pictures for everyone.  Back up at the top they have 2 people making homemade lamb stew, it was delicious and a great way to relax before heading back.  Because we drove there ourselves (not a bus tour), they let us hike back when we were ready and at our own pace.  We enjoyed being by ourselves for a bit.  Definitely recommend!"
Unique experience,"A very well organized and unique experience going into a volcano. The drive to their base camp is one of the most scenic in Iceland. Once there, they can kit you out with long raincoats if required, then you are off for the 1hr easy hike to the volcano. Timing is very well worked out with the time you have inside the volcano perfect to explore the entire route. Afterwards the soup is most welcome!"
amazing journey to the center of the earth!,"This is one of the coolest things we've ever done.  You start with a hike across lava fields to the volcano.  Be warned it can be windy and rainy, so dress appropriately.  They give you long rain jackets which are definitely worth using.  Once there, you go with a small group into the volcano.  Its otherworldly!  You drop down a small opening into a massive cavern with colors of all sorts.  The guides help you understand what happened and you get 30ish minutes to take it all in.  The Icelandic meat stew after you get back up top is a nice bonus, especially on a chilly day.  All in all, highly recommend this!"
Highlight of Iceland,"This was an amazing and truly unique experience!  We were lucky enough to do this tour on a sunny day so the hike to and from the volcano was very enjoyable surrounded by the beautiful landscape of Iceland. While the ride on the lift was a bit scary, you felt safe the entire time and it was completely worth it to see the inside of the volcano. It was beautiful! The staff at their basecamp was very kind and inviting and even give you homemade soup after you come back form the volcano. We even were able to walk through some lava tubes on our way back!Definitely a highlight of our trip to Iceland and worth the high price tag!"
Amazing Experience,"This experience was our favorite of all the tours we booked while in Iceland. The pictures don’t do the inside of the volcano any just - it’s simply incredible to see. The hike to the base of the crater took about 45-50 minutes and is essentially flat but it is an uneven surface. The hike up to a the lift that lowers you into the volcano is much easier and shorter than described on the website. The tour isn’t cheap but it’s well worth the experience. They limited the number of people inside at any one time so you didn’t feel crowded. Each group was allowed 30 minutes inside the volcano. The staff at the base camp was very welcoming and they provided soup, tea, coffe, water, and hot cocoa free of charge. We were able to hike back to the parking lot by ourselves so we didn’t have to wait for the balance of the group to finish up."
Something different!,"Although quite expensive, this was a fantastic experience! We were quite lucky with the weather, so the hike there and back was very enjoyable too. And the view of Reykjavik from the top of the volcano was amazing! Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Nice soup at the base camp."
A Life Experience,"I took my 14 year old son for this tour and I know he will remember it for the rest of his life.  The tour is that unique and exciting.  Our tour guide, a lovely young woman named Obba, was superb, very kind and considerate.  All the staff were super-friendly and helpful.  The weather was foul with high winds and driving rain but for us it all added to the experience.  That soup was all the more welcome."
Volcano ,"What an amazing tour.  The guides were the nicest people, the views inside and hiking to the volcano are a “can’t miss” when in Iceland.  The Arctic Fox was just a bonus!!"
YOU MUST DO THIS!,"An absolutely incredible experience and not something you can do anywhere else in the world!   Despite the 3 km hike to get there, on level ground, but uneven, it was worth the effort,  A surreal experience in a surreal country.  All protective gear is provided and afterwards there is delicious soup ideal for the cooler weather!"
Unbelievable Experience,"What more is there to say? It's the only spot in the world where you can actual descend into a volcano, and it's as memorable of an experience as it seems. The hike is very easy, and you're given stew (lamb or vegetarian) which was one of the best meals we had in Iceland."
Amazing experience!!!!,"You literally descend into a volcano - it's amazing!!!  There are so many colors and different layers of rock to look at you feel you could spend hours in there.  The 45 minutes hike to the entrance is beautiful in itself, although when we did it we took it at quite a pace.  The landscape of Iceland is so gorgeous there is always something to look at.  Descending into the volcano on the open elevator system was amazing because as you went down you could see all the colors and layers of rocks.  It was definitely worth the price - it was a great part of our vacation to Iceland!!!"
Far exceeded expectations,"This is the only volcano in the world that you can go into.  That is why the price may seem high.  However, you get a great experience for the money.  However, it is worth the money if you can afford it (as other reviewers have mentioned).  They allow for a lot of time and exploring inside the volcano which is astoundingly beautiful.  The volcano is epic in every sense of the word.  Our guide was excellent.  the guys at the base camp were excellent.  Pick up from and back to Reykjavik went smoothly.  I'd allow 6-7 hours for this tour.  There is a mostly flat hike to and from the volcano across the lava field which is nearly as good as going down the volcano itself.  It requires an average level of fitness and mobility.  The website accurately describes cancellation policy and what to do if you are self driving to departure site."
Literally inside the volcano!,"Descending into a dormant volcano using an open elevator system was an experience to remember for life so it was definitely worth to pay for this tour! The hike up to the crater was breathtaking as well, so it was a good start to our 12 day road trip in Iceland. The groups were kept small and the guides were informative and experienced- they never compromised on safety with all the procedures in place.It was really a journey towards the centre of the earth!"
Inside of a silent volcano in Iceland  ,"The multitude of colours in the left behind rock at the bottom of 140 meter deep well is Mesmerising  The Walk through the Lava fields covered With Moss and only Moss is bewildering . Nature preserved with sacrosanct like attitude of Icelanders is praiseworthy   Coffee at the start and end of walk of three and half kilometres is welcoming. The guides are not Ina hurry to walk or explain the history , geography awesome landscape . Going into Volcano through the mouth is not scary and the child inquisition becomes manifold. Keep looking and taking pictures of fissures , rocks during descent. 4degrees centigrade temperature at the bottom in late August is bearable  you are also cautioned about footwear and clothes at the time of booking your tour. You are left free to walk through a rough passage of rocks by the help of helmet light Dont get injured at that place !! Awesome pictures make you feel wonder struck   See some pictures."
Fantastic Experience,"We had an amazing trip to Iceland and this was to be our final activity. First I must say that Markus in reservations bent over backwards to accommodate our group. He was amazing, we can't thank him enough. We arrived to Base Camp and met our 2 great guides and leaders who set the tone for an unforgettable 4 hours. The hike there was around 45 minutes each way and was not that difficult. Only the last 5 minutes were a bit steep. Once there we were offered food and drink, then they haltered us on up which greatly enhanced and set the tone for the anticipated highlight  The trip down was amazing, and the whole family had a blast exploring the inside of the magma chamber. Everything we learned about Iceland came to life in front of our eyes. All in all, it was an awesome trip and it was certainly a great way to end off our visit to Iceland. Also, knowing that this was the only place in the world that such an activity can be done made it that much more special. Every employee was as nice as can be. Thank you all so much again!"
One of the highlights of our time in Iceland!!,"Awesome.  Traveled all over the world, and never experienced anything like this.  Eventually, the masses will come, but for now, how amazing.  Descend into a dormant volcano crater in a lift.  See and sense the magnitude of the space.  Amazing colors and formations.  History.  A glimpse at the power of nature.  Yes - I sound like a travel brochure for this place, but I’m not - go if you can."
Once in a Lifetime Experience,"Visiting the volcano was amazing.  A quick, easy hike brought us to the base camp where we were outfitted and split into small groups.  Once we went down into the volcano come we were able to walk around an explore the area.  Our guide was friendly, open and informative.  We had 40 minutes to look around, take pictures and explore.  The rock formations and colors are incredible.  After our return to basecamp we were offered a tasty soup and then hiked back to the drop off point.  This was an amazing and once in a lifetime experience that can't be found anywhere else!"
Iceland adventure,"The wonder of nature was spectacular, but the enthusiasm, humor and friendliness of the staff made it a fantastic experience!  And tasty soup too!!!"
Spectacular,"We saved this experience for the last full day of our trip. It was phenomenal! The crew was great... informative and helpful... but the volcano gets credit. Standing inside the cavity of this geological wonder was awe-inspiring. The easy two mile hike gives you enough time to anticipate the experience on the way out and savor it on the way back. Mori (sp?) the arctic fox was a bonus. Inside the Volcano was the only organized tour we scheduled for our week trip to Iceland. It was a splurge, and totally worth it."
Amazing experience,"One of the highlights of our trip to Iceland, lovely guides and fascinating and very unique experience, the meat soup and coffee was yum and very welcome after! I would be interested to hear a bit more of the geology, and I remember being in a cave years ago in Australia and the guides played some music to demonstrate the acoustics, which could be interesting...    A fabulous day, highly recommended"
Highlight of Iceland ,"Loved the hike across the lava fields, the Arctic fox, the descent into the volcano, the walk around the bottom. Good to go on first trip of day, so nobody else is down there when you descend. It is expensive, but all activitivies in Iceland are expensive and this is unique."
Super Tour,"We booked the 12 o'clock Tour with pickup in Reykjavik. From the pickup to the end everything was great. Absolutly just in time. Inside the Volcano is absolutly unbelievable. It is unique in the whole world. If you expect some lava or an eruption you are at the wrong place. Better go to Italy and jump into the Vesuv. The Tour is not cheap but this area is a completely drinking water protection area. And to all those Loosers who can not read a description or book a Tour and don't know how much it costs and have to save every penny for a Trip to Iceland, better stay at home with Mummy."
Most unique and best experience ,The team were amazing. And the experience was  so authentic. Getting inside a volcano is a once in a lifetime opportunity and the guys made it so much fun and special. It ends with a famous homemade Icelandic sheep soup. Recommend you were good walking shoes as there is 3km trek to get to the volcano and you can never predict the weather so be prepared for cold and rain.
Beyond Incredible!,Wow what an experience! Took along my husband and 8 year old son and had the most amazing adventure.  My son thoroughly loved every moment but he is used to doing adventurous activities.  Wouldn’t recommend for younger children or more mature adults as the walk is 3 kilometers on uneven ground. You need to be fairly fit to do this and the experience goes ahead rain or shine. The staff are superb ... assisting you with everything along the way and very informative.  Cannot recommend this tour highly enough.  A once in a lifetime experience.
Highlight of Iceland,"Everything in Iceland is amazing. Inside the Volcano was a truly unique (only place in the world where you can go inside a volcano!) and breathtaking. Indescribable. Great hike through lava fields, very easy and comfortable descent down to the floor. Our sons (12 & 14) said it was their favorite part of the trip. It is very expensive and takes about a full day to do, but completely worthwhile. Photos won't do it justice. Phenomenal experience."
Breathtaking ,"The view from inside the volcano is breathtaking and a marvel to see. This amazing natural resource is lovely. The guides are knowledgeable and friendly. I was not happy with the rude behavior of the driver for Grey Line tours. This is very expensive, you are paying for the elevator ride into the volcano. It’s worth the money...I guess."
Obviously Amazing,"No doubts, it is an amazing excursion. First for what you see (unique) and second thanks to their wonderful staff (so customer service oriented). Thank you for that really nice time guys ! (If I would remember our guides names, they would have a big mention on this review: they were amazing !)."
Don't miss this opportunity!,"What a fantastic experience from the very beginning.  The guides were very friendly and helpful, the scenery was beautiful and the drop into the volcano was very safe.  There was a woman on our tour that was afraid at first, however ended up relaxed and enjoyed the experience.  Definitely something you shouldn't miss."
Unique,"Descending 120 m. down into this dormant volcano was an amazing experience. The feeling and sights of being inside an empty magma chamber, with its breathtaking depth, colors, and stone formations, were unlike anything else. The hike before and after was also very nice. Definitely worth going when in Iceland."
Expensive but worth-visiting,"It was the most expensive tour we joined in Reykjavik however we found it was the most interesting one ever. We were required an easy 1/2 hour hike to the base camp under heavy rain, we were all wet when we finished the tour.  The hot soup was another brilliant idea of the tour.  The guide provided useful knowledge of volcanoes and the members of staff were helpful and friendly."
Amazing and Mind Blowing,"The trek up to the volcano was very scenic and easy, the guides were super friendly and knowledgeable, the meat soup at the end was fantastic, and the volcano magma chamber was AMAZING... Even so, the trip is rather pricey. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it so much if my travelling companion wasn't a former geology student. Their excitement was very contagious :) Thus, it was well worth the $420 each to me, but might not be for others!"
Best thing we did in Iceland,"This was by far the best thing we did in Iceland - totally worth the price! You meet with the group at a ski lodge then hike/walk for about 45 minutes. It's not super strenuous but does get a little steep towards the end. We had a beautiful sunny day but definitely check the weather because it's really windy on the walk and if it had been raining it would have been way colder! So be prepared to bundle up. They have a link for weather at the volcano on their website so check that!You finish the walk at a shipping container that they call base camp. I was in the first group so we pretty quickly got harnesses & helmets on and took the final walk to get on the lift. The lift ride takes about 6 minutes, they let you out and you have roughly 25-30 minutes to walk around inside of the volcano. After we took the lift back up, we had soup and coffee and hung out for a bit. If you drive yourself to the ski lodge then you can hang out at base camp as long as you want and hike back at your own leisure. If you take the bus then you have to leave with your group at a set time to get back to the bus. We drove ourselves so we hung out and then did the 45 minute walk back when we were ready. The guides were really great and the inside of the volcano was like nothing I've ever seen. I know its pricey but it's totally worth it!"
"Stunning location, wonderful guides","Everyone working on the Inside The Volcano team was incredibly welcoming, kind, and professional. The tour itself and all the little extras provided around it (rain gear, bandanas, beverages, and that delicious lamb soup) made me feel like staying with friends - even though it's an extremely efficient operation rotating group after group of tourists through the different phases and stations of the entire tour. Somehow they still make everyone feel kind of special by being genuinely nice and interested. Not once did it feel like a routine machinery, and that is impressive. :)The volcano itself is stunning and unique - no other magma chamber on earth has been preserved in this way, which truly makes it a once-in-a-lifetime experience. (Although I might visit again if I ever come back to Iceland, despite my fear of heights and the discomfort that added to the elevator ride. It's still worth it.)"
Unique experience!,Amazing experience!   Only place where you can enter a volcano.  The staff were friendly and knowledgeable .  I was pleasantly surprised that they had raincoats available .  We were fortunate though that it did not rain during our visit until we were leaving.   We were also lucky to “meet” a local young arctic fox that was hanging around the base camp.  It was adorable and silly.  It hung close by for a while that morning.   It repeatedly chased its tail and tumbled along as he did so.  The staff reported that they were giving a minimum of support to this orphaned fox with hopes it would grow and support itself in the wild. The magma chamber is enormous!  It took a while to reach the bottom .  The lighting was well done. Beautiful colors made by the original eruption.  Good information from the staff.  The meat soup was perfect after that.  Wow!  So glad we did this!  My only criticism of this experience is that the staff hiked at too brisk a pace.  I like to walk.  The terrain was fine.  But it was not comfortable for me or my family to walk at our guide’s pace.
Unique,"Though very expensive, this tour is one of a kind. Being in the empty magma chamber is just eerie and exciting. The tour is very well organized: they pick you up at the hotel (or you can drive to the bus terminal or the location of the tour), provide you with the waterproof/windproof coat (highly recommended - it was cold, wet, and very windy - in August), and then you hike for 3 km to the volcano. There, they take you down into the bowels of the earth for about 30 minutes, where you are free to walk around and take pictures. Then up you go, track back for 3 km, eat absolutely amazing lamb soup, and head back to where you were picked up from."
The only place in the world to go inside a volcano!,"Iceland is expensive. Just accept it. So while you are there, what do you want to spend money on? We decided to do this trip because it is so unique. We were not disappointed. There is a lot of infrastructure and staff involved in this exhibit, so I felt the cost was justified. Really well done exhibit. The inside of the volcano was very colorful and the guide explained the various minerals that created the colors.The lamb soup that people have mentioned was the perfect hot food after being in the chamber which is refrigerator temperature.The walk to the volcano and back was at a brisk pace but the path was pretty even and not a difficult walk. I wore LL Bean boots and others wore hiking boots and even sneakers. Luckily, it did not rain while we were there.The folks working there have adopted a baby artic fox, so cute. He hangs out by the base camp by the volcano. I got to pet him!"
Amazing,My husband and I booked the private tour.  The guide was very nice and knowledgeable.  The walk to the volcano was quite windy so I would recommend bringing more clothes/accessories than you think you will need.  It was great being the only two people in the volcano.  It was something I had never seen before.  They made us Islandic soup after seeing the volcano and it was delicious.
One of a kind,"This is an amazing adventure. The tour is very well organized from start to finish. The company will pick you up and take you to the gathering point. You will be organized into small groups and then the adventrure begins. You begin the 2 mile walk to the volcano led by the guide who will stop at a couple of predetermined location along the way for rest and explanation of the special features of the lava field and volcanos. At the end of the walk is a trail house where you are given snacks and suited up for the descent. It is a nice warm space that has all a small gift shop, food and drinks. After everyone is suited up you go in groups of 5-6 to the descent. Everyone is harnessed into the lift and you are lowered down a few hundred feet as they explain the geology of the area. At the bottom you are given some more details and allowed to wander around for 30 minutes and take pictures. It is amazing, colorful and other-wordly. You then get taken back up the lift and return back to the trail house for soup and more drinks before the walk back to the gathering point. Excellent!"
Inside the Volcano,"This was one of those experiences of a lifetime. It was raining, windy, and cold. I was the straggler of the group and struggled to keep up, but our rear guide, (Stephana?) was very helpful and kind. She let me go at my own pace without pressure. Once we were inside the volcano, it was a breathtaking experience totally worth the weather and hike. Hot soup was served by friendly staff at base camp. I wasn’t feeling well afterwards, and again our rear guide was wonderful. She walked us back at my own pace. I am so thankful that this company made this experience possible for us."
Amazing tour!,"Fantastic tour! Just the hike to the volcano is worth it, you even get to check some lava tunnels. Then you get inside the volcano, and, WOW!!! The colours are just amazing!The tour guides were super friendly and knowledgeable."
Excellent,"I took the tour solo, the group was excellent and the guides were nice. Soup and tea were good and it was a nice warm up. The volcano was amazing, for sure a once in a lifetime experience!"
amazing,this once in a lifetime tour was well organized and something to see. The only dormant volcano in the world that you can actually visit from the inside. Anybody visiting Iceland should put this on the top of their list.
Greatest Birthday Present,"We were spending some extra time in Reykjavik before going on a week long tour. So my travel partner had her birthday and the best present I could think of was an adventure.  It was something neither of us had done before. You don’t have to be Superwoman, just normal walking ability to do this activity. I know they wouldn’t let us do something REALLY risky.  They took double safety precautions for our decent into a real magma chamber, not freezing  and not windy inside!  I was wondering if this was just a tourist trap, BUT IM VERY GLAD I/ WE went. IT IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD! The colors left on the walls when molten lava melts minerals is AMAZING.  MY FRIEND LOVED HER BIRTHDAY PRESENT!"
Excellent and unique experience,"I really loved this tour. It is so different from anything else you can experience. I had to choose between this and the Into the Glacier tour. I chose the volcano tour and have no regrets as there will be other glaciers in the world to experience. However, this is the only place where you can go inside the magma chamber  of a dormant volcano. A lot of beautiful colors and formations to view and photograph. Although I had no problem with the hike to the volcano my friend who came with me was not as enchanted. Of course, she is not in as good a shape as me, so that needs to be taken into consideration. Our day was  misty, some wind and later on some light rain with stronger winds. This made the return trip a little bit more challenging. It is very expensive, but well worth the money. Even my friend admitted that she was glad she went but would not do  yet again, mainly because of the hike, not the volcano interior itself. On the return, we were treated to a bowl of Icelandic soup, coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. A very welcoming way to warm up before the trip back.  For those who are older or not in good shape, the hike to the volcano can be challenging.  Our group had split on the hike to a faster group that war with the lead guide, and a slower one that was escorted by the guide at the back.  That was a good way to get us all to the volcano base and no one was left behind or had to knock themselves out to keep up.  Well done."
Worth it!,"The 2km hike is more of an easy walk, with a bit of hiking up for the last 5 minutes.  Guides were nice and helpful, the base camp has hot beverages and water and the soup after the trip down was very tasty.  They do provide helmets and a harness to strap into for the lift into the volcano.  The lift is a bit nerve wracking if you're afraid of heights or claustrophobic, but worth it once you reach the bottom.  Amazing sights!"
An excellent tour!,"This tour was one of our favorites that we did in Iceland. My 10 and 11 year olds loved it! The hike across the lava field was enjoyable and made us feel like we’d accomplished something. I had a touch of claustrophobia as the lift began lowering into the volcano which I fortunately recovered from quickly. Once at the bottom, we had a blast climbing on the rocks and going into the “hole” and taking all kinds of cool pictures. The temperature was fine down there because it was out of the wind. Just a little damp from the groundwater. We loved the hot tea and coffee and soup back at the top and seeing the tame Arctic Fox made the kids’ day! Definitely recommend this tour!"
one of a kind experience,"This is a very expensive trip, but as it is one of a kind it is worth it. We went for our 12 year old and he said: COOL - THE BEST! Staff is very friendly, qualified, safety oriented and skillful. We were Lucky With warm sunny weather, but you need to dress according to the weather in the Mountains, when rain and snow may come in short notice. Not a difficult hike, but you need good footware"
Unique ezperimec,A fantastic experience to see inside a volcano and all the different colours. You are well looked after with rain coats and then some lovely warm soup after being down in the volcano.
Inside The Volcano,"Very unique experience. Once in a lifetime. Expensive but not unreasonably so given the cost of operations and number of staff. Staff are excellent, very knowledgeable, friendly, and able to answer all of ur many questions. Our guide has a masters degree in geology.Definitely recommend this adventure."
Things you ought to know about Inside the Volcano,"There were a number of things I wished I knew before I went on the Inside the Volcano tour, so to help you out, here are a few pointers:The bus takes you to a ski lodge. From there you have to walk about 45 minutes to the base camp. It's an easy walk across flat, rocky terrain, if the weather is nice. If it's stormy, that's a really long walk. And you'll have to walk back to the ski lodge afterwards. So try to pick a day with decent weather.Only 7 or 8 people can go down at a time, so if your bus has 20 people on it, you'll be divided into 3 groups, about ten minutes apart. You'll stay at the bottom for about 30 minutes and come back to base camp for some soup. Between the bus ride, the walk, and wait, 30 minutes inside, and then coming back up, it was about 3 hours from the time of departure until we had food. I was really hungry by then. The 8:00 or 9:00 departure is ideal, or wait until after lunch, or bring snacks.A building window washing contraption carries you down into the volcano. It really isn't scary. I expected that there was a hike inside, but not really. You're in a fairly small area. There is a path that goes in a loop around the inside to see everything closely, but it takes only 5 minutes or so do the loop if you don't stop and take pictures every few steps (which you will). Shockingly, the t-shirts and other gifts sold at base camp are cheaper than in town. Their t-shirt which they sell for 2000 kr is nicer than the generic Iceland t-shirts sold in the regular gift shops for 4000 kr. Now for the big question - is it worth it? It certainly isn't cheap, but keeping in mind that they can only take 20 people per hour, they can only operate during the non-winter months, and the number of people it takes to operate and guide, and the general cost of everything in Iceland, the price isn't unreasonable. My wife, who is incredibly cheap, says it was a unique experience and totally worth it."
Quite a Unique Experience,"The tour begins with an approximately 2 mile very brisk guided walk across a lava field to a base camp/cabin. Optional long raincoats are provided - we definitely used those on the way out to the crater, but got a little warm and removed them on the way back. Once you reach the base camp, you’re divided into groups of about 7 to 9.  Each group is outfitted with a helmet and climbing belt. About every 20-30 minutes a group is led up the final walk to the crater (a fairly steep 150 meters or so - it was a bit of a struggle for the 70 plus year olds in our group) to the open elevator. Refreshments (free) are available for waiting groups. At the top, individuals walk across a short metal platform and then are clipped to the elevator. The descent is fairly slow and takes about 4 minutes. Upon reaching the crater floor you have about 20 to 30 minutes to walk around and explore. The reality of being inside an actual volcanic crater is  mind-boggling. Traditional Icelandic soup (meat or vegetarian) is provided at the base cabin after your tour. You walk back to the entry point at your own pace. We quite enjoyed the whole experience. You should be in decent shape for the walk to/from the base camp and the final ascent (not too long) to the crater opening."
Fabulous experience! Highly recommend! ,"What an experience! Trek across the lava fields with sun rain and wind and descent into the bowels of the earth in a very small platform ! Guides really knowledgeable, helpful and friendly - even if you’re scared of heights they are there to assist! Highly recommend 👍👍👍"
Unique experience,"We loved everything about this tour: the expirience inside the volcano, the short hike to the spot, the perfect organisation and the kind add-ons like tasty soup, hot drinks etc. On top there was a young arctic fox around."
Inside the volcano,"Amazing tour, amazing guides n super tasty soup 🍲 We had a ride about 30 min w the special shuttle, after 3 km walking (the company provides the equipment), 6 min by the special elevator inside the volcano, around 20 min to explore the gorgeous “bottom” n after soupppppp yummy 😋 u can also choose the soup (lamb or vegan one). Nice experience, we loved everything what we’ve heard, seen n tried. Thx for an amazing day! N I also loved your baby fox 🦊 ❤️"
Unique,"If you are picked up and returned to your hotel, this is a 5-6 hour investment. About an hour after pickup, you begin a 45 minute hike across a lava field to base camp, where you are fitted for harness and helmet. The 24 person tour group is split into three sub-groups and dispatched at 15 minute intervals for lowering into the magma chamber, which is quite an experience.  Upon return to base camp, you are served a nice hot stew before the 45 minute return hike. The hike is across relatively flat ground until the final couple hundred yards at which point it is quite steep. Regardless, 45 minutes of steady hiking across a lava field is not a leisurely stroll. It can definitely be an issue for the elderly or the infirm, and even for those in marginal physical condition. And at $400/ it is certainly not cheap. If you can afford the time, the money and the physical exertion, it is well worth it."
fantastic!!!,"this tour was incredible for us. we spent a unique afternoon. they drive you to the location, then you have to walk for around 45 minutes to the volcano. it is a simple and flat hike, but getting ino the volcano is an outstanding experience. it was one of the most beautiful things we ever did. the guides were all very friendly, competent and keen to explain the basis of the geology the led to the formation of the magma chamber of the volcano. nice plus: you get a soup at the end of the tour! it is a very expensive tour, but seriously, was really well spent money!!!"
Worth the money,My first thought is this is exy but l found the experience well organized and really exciting and interesting. I recommend it.
Unique life experience with highly enagaging and informative guides,"Enjoyed each of the well trained and prepared guides that brought the history of this only accessible volcano in the world, to life. Breath-taking sights inside the volcano with lots of opportunity for questions and viewing."
An easy hike to a beautiful volcano... also soup.,"An easy 45 minute hike over a pebbled trail to base camp. Once there, your group (about 5 to 6 people) saddle up into harnesses, helmets and head lamps and perhaps catch a glimpse of the baby arctic fox. From there you have a 5 minute uphill hike to the mouth of the volcano (all were winded). You clip into the modified window washer ""elevator"" and descend down. Once inside, you get a 10 minute history info session with your guide then 20 minutes to walk around the roped areas to explore. When called you hop back into the ""elevator"" and ascend. From there you can have a bowl of hot soup (lamb or veggie), coffee or water. My partner and I asked to hike back on our own. It is beautiful and a novel experience, however the price does not reflect what it is. Information is shared, inside the volcano is beautiful and interesting but it is not an incredibly personalized experience. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you the guides name..."
Unique experience,"Our family of four (12yo and 14yo kids) booked this experience a few days before the tour day. Luckily, there were 4 spots left on the day we wanted to visit.This is basically how it works:It takes approximately 6 hours starting from hotel pickup stop to hotel drop off. After all the pickups, the bus will drop everyone off at the main building where you can go to the washroom. This is also where you can borrow a (highly recommended) sturdy yellow rain coat. You are given an option to lock away anything that you don’t want to carry.Next, a relatively easy hour walk/hike to the Volcano’s base camp. This is where they gear you up with safety belts, hard hats and a souvenir bandana. Washrooms can be found here too.Small groups enter the Volcano on a window cleaning lift/elevator which takes about 7 minutes to descend.You can wander down below for about 30 minutes. There is a roped path that circles around the base that you can follow.When it’s time to leave, you head back out to base camp for a hot bowl of veggie or lamb soup, coffee, tea and hot chocolate.We were lucky to see the baby Arctic Fox exploring the base. Afterwards, you trek back to the main building and catch the bus back to Reykjavík.Loved the whole experience! Wonderful people working there to make the day memorable."
Too much waiting around ,"If you have limited time in Iceland, and are looking to make the most of your time and money I would recommend against this experience. We spent over an hour idly waiting (tour left around 20 mins after schedule) and then at the ‘base camp’ had to wait around an hour for our turn to go down the volcano. For the price you pay you would really not expect to just be sitting around in cabins for such a period of time.In hindsight, it would have been a better decision to do the glacier hike or snowmobile- there are much better options in Iceland for your time and money.The volcano itself was an interesting experience but using up the best part of a day wasn’t a good use of time.They have priced this as a premium offering but in reality it’s run more like a standard / low cost tour."
Worth every 100 dollars!,"Yep, this adventure is expensive! But worth every dollar, rupee, sole or euro! Nice little hike across the lava field then up to the top of the crater and then down, down, down into the inside of a real ""dead"" volcano. One of the most unique activities in the world. Don't miss it! We were there in July 2016."
Venture 130m inside a volcano just outside Reykjavík.,"This is a must do tour when in Iceland. Just 30 mins out of Reykjavík you hike a few klms to a volcano then jump into a cable lift and descend 130m into a volcano. For the thrill seekers in all of us. Tour only operates 4 months a year and is well worth it so book in early. The hike is easy, the soup afterwards is tasty and the guides are super friendly and informative"
Adventure,Amazing once in a lifetime descent inside of a volcano.  Two mile hike in an out.  They were very professional and safety was a priority.  Learned about volcanos and soup and hot drinks were included.  A must see for thrill seekers in Iceland!
Wow,"You can expect a hike of 45min through lava fields with two short stops where the guide gives you some background information on what you are seeing and are going to see. After that you will be split up in groups of about six people and to be lowerd 120m in a basket into the magma chamber of a volcano. Through a yet unexplained event the magmachamber drained after the eruption and therefore you can visit the chamber. There is no other knwown volcano where this is possible!. The descent takes about 6 minutes and you will spend about half an hour in the magma chamber itself. I have hardly any words of what you will see; beautiful colors and structures fo something very old, rough and violent. Then you go up again and get a nice bowl of hot soup and hike back. Guides always guard your safety. We were there on a very misty day and, though cold and wet, it added to the mystery of the experience. If you havethe budget; must do! Dress warm, rain overcoats are available."
An Experience you Will Not Find Anywhere Else,"Let's consider the implication of this attraction: there is a volcano out there that you can climb inside. For a lot of people, like me, that's enough to convince them this is an opportunity that should not be passed up. But if you need a little more convincing, how about an invigorating hike through lava fields, the guidance of the friendliest team we saw during our week in Iceland, delicious soup to warm you up, and so much more that I know I'm going to forget parts of what made this such a delight as I write up this review. Suffice it to say, Inside the Volcano was the absolute best experience we had on our trip, and it easily ranks up there with the greatest attractions we have visited around the world.Before we get too far into this, yes, the price is daunting. Is it worth every penny? Absolutely. Should you spend the money necessary to do this? Absolutely. With all that in mind, let's go.The trip starts with a bus ride up to the lodge. This is maybe 25 minutes outside of Reykjavik, and really sets the tone for where you'll be spending the next few hours. On the day we visited, it was overcast, gloomy and raining. Which sounds like typical Icelandic weather, I guess. Was this enough to deter us? No way, especially since they provide you with raincoats you will absolutely want to take with you.There were about 20 of us and our guide, Thora, divided us up into three groups so we would all take turns going down into the volcano once we got there. We were then guided downstairs to the bathrooms and the raincoats, and with everyone ready to go, we were off!The hike is about 3km each way, and it's pretty forgiving. Yeah, there are places where it is uneven, and the last 50m, or so, are kind of at an incline, but it's a good walk the majority of the way. Does that mean you need to be in decent physical shape to do this? Possibly, but I look at it like this: I work a desk job and was once in a gym about 11 years ago. I like to tell people ""I'm built for comfort, not speed."" And if I can do this hike, you can do this hike.Plus the picture opportunities along the way, even in the rain, are worth it. Yes, it rained the whole way up to the volcano, and yes, the wind blew the rain into our faces, but you soon get used to it. And hey, there's coffee waiting for you when you get up to the cabin by the base of the volcano!Once there, we got suited up with our harnesses and hardhats, and took a moment to say ""hi"" to Mori. He's an arctic fox who periodically comes and goes, and he somehow has fantastic hair even in the rain. The guides up here have adopted him, and he has personality to burn. (Though, to be fair, there's no guarantee you'll see him during your visit; he's got a lot of terrain to explore up there!)With all that in mind, we hiked up another quick trail, and took the three-minute ride into the volcano. The lift may make you feel claustrophobic, and you'll be going down from a great height, but it's not that bad. The view is spectacular, but that's nothing compared to what awaits you once you're down in the volcano.And this is where I want to make a special shout out to Thora. There's probably nothing she cannot do. She was incredibly supportive of our group during our hike, she was knowledgable of all things Iceland, she took some amazing photos of us in the volcano, and she was a warm, positive force to everyone she talked with. Which is not to take away from the rest of the team - all the guides were welcoming and engaging, but we could not say enough kind things about Thora.But really, now that we're 10 paragraphs into the review, I suppose we should talk about the volcano. The only problem is there are no words to do the volcano justice. It's colder inside the volcano than the hike you took to get there, but you will not want to leave. There is so much wonder and splendor to surround yourself with, and your time inside the volcano will be unlike anything you have ever experienced.We got back on the lift and enjoyed some hearty Icelandic lamb soup back at the cabin. It warmed us up and prepared us for the hike back. It seemed like the walk back went quicker, despite being almost completely engulfed in fog. Once there, we hung our coats back up, got back on the bus and headed off knowing what we had just done was an absolutely once-in-a-lifetime experience.Take the time and make plans to visit Inside the Volcano. I promise you it is an adventure you will talk about for the rest of your life."
The Highlight of Our Trip!,"This was the best part of our trip.  The hike was easy, the group size wasn’t too large, the soup was delicious and the guides were amazing.  Thanks Unnur and Solely!  We had a great time!  Go and do this!"
Unforgettable,A magnificent glimpse into the heart of a volcano. A truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. Every aspect of the experience was well-managed but a professional crew.
Excellent trip,"The bus took us on schedule, the tour guide had 30 years experience and helped us to understand the other parts of Iceland.  Overall, this trip is a learning curve.  We love it.  Thanks for having us."
Amazing experience!,Easy contact with organizers before the trip. Vegetarian/Vegan option of the food served available. Going inside the volcano - unforgettable experience!
One of the most unique experiences near Reykjavik,"This excursion was both the most expensive and my most favorite of 5 Reykjavik excursions I took. This experience is so unique and so beautiful, I would recommend it to anybody up for the physical requirements. After a 30 minute drive to the meeting point, you’ll hike across lave fields (about 2 miles) to the basecamp for staging and a safety talk for the final ascent to the entry point. The descent in a cage takes about six minutes and is absolutely beautiful. After your adventure you’ll return to basecamp for a complementary steaming bowl of traditional lamb stew. You have to try it!"
A Unique Experience,"A very well organised, unique exploration of a beautiful phenomenum. Friendly, professional staff and reliable technology. Awesome !"
Interesting ,"Interesting place to see as it is one of its kind, the only accessible volcano to visit, around 4000 years old. Very friendly and informative staff, nice and easy hiking to the crater. They serve delicious and warm soup after the tour. However to be honest I believe it is over-priced"
Wonderful journey to the center of earth,"Me and my husband decided to take this trip at the last moment since this is an expensive trip. We are glad that we went for this.There is a 3km walk through the lava field which is light walk and beautiful. The last 50m is hike. It was cloudy and windy and some shower. So please put on a waterproof pants and Jacket. The wind made it feel chill so I was wearing  gloves. Once you reach the bottom of the Volcano they serve you with hot coffee/tea. And soup after you return from Volcano, which was really good.Inside the Volcano is cold but beautiful. Once a life time experience. We had more than enough time (was waiting for the lift for at least 5-10mins). This is a definitely to do item if you are visiting Iceland!!"
Unique Experience,"First off - yes this is expensive.  However, everything in Iceland is.  This is a one of a kind experience.  We loved the hike out to the volcano with the amazing landscape all around us.  The guides were warm and informative.   The base camp was great.  They had coffee and water and (after the tour) delicious lamb soup.  When we were there they had a friendly young arctic fox roaming around.   Being inside the volcano itself was incredible.  The geology was fascinating and beautiful.  Would definitely recommend."
Amazing experience with a special surprise,"Definitely a must do tour when in Iceland- the volcano is gorgeous, and a fantastic bucket list item. That being said, the real star of the tour was an unexpected one- the tour guides have taken in a baby arctic fox, Mori (2 months old as of July 2018) is the most precious angel and if you’re lucky you’ll be blessed with his presence. I can’t promise he’ll be there if you visit because he runs around and does his own thing, but definitely keep an eye out"
Definitely worth it,"Expensive but a once in a lifetime experience. A nice hike in. We were late as our bus didn't pick us up and they were super accommodating and waited for us at the volcano (tip: if you book through a tour company make sure to also book the pickup as it is separate, though not an extra cost- our tour company didn't make this clear and didn't book the bus when we asked them to, I think they expected us to do this ourselves with a tiny link embedded in the pdf ticket). Don't expect a lot of science with this tour. Guides were super nice but were not scientists or volcano experts. Well worth doing."
Fantastic Adventure,"My husband and I had a wonderful time - this was definitely a highlight of our trip to Iceland. The guides were the best - friendly, helpful, outgoing, and they made everything very easy. Yes, it is an expensive adventure, and more then I’ve paid for other excursions, but honestly it was worth the price. The delicious Icelandic meat soup served at the end is the perfect finish to this trip."
Amazing tour,"A once in a lifetime experience of actually going inside a volcano chamber! The guides were very friendly and fun to talk to! They even made us Icelandic soup! On top of that, the volcano over looks Reykjavik for a stunning view. A nice hike through the lava fields was refreshing and not strenuous. If you are here, you definitely should check this place out!"
An amazing experience,"We had a great time during this excursion. Everything from the guides and staff to the hike and going into the volcano were well managed. From the very first to the last we felt welcomed and in good hands by the staff and guides. It is in many ways a family run business and it feels that way by the way they are proud of their business and passionate about what they do. We actually enjoyed the hike out and back almost as much as going into the volcano itself. It’s a beautiful landscape. Being in he volcano, of course, is almost indescribably cool. As they keep each group small the experience was intimate and not stressful at all. One last note. I am a person who gets nervous about tight spaces and sometimes with heights. I was bothered by neither. I had no problems going down on the lift or walking around in the caldera. If you have the time and the money I would highly recommend this excursion. Just remember to book ahead as they always sell out."
A Unique Experience,Did this as part of motorhome tour round Iceland & drove to the start point going through an amazing landscape.Very lucky with the weather being sunny and not windy.The walk is an enjoyable part of it.The descent is different in the window cleaning machine.Inside the volcano is truly humbling and mind blowing knowing there is no where else in the world you can do this.The colours almost defy description.All the staff were very good.The soup is very welcome when you return to the surface.Yes it is not cheap but how often are you going into an intact volcano and you can't take your money with you.JUST DO IT!!!!
Unique adventure,"My wife and I took this tour 3 days ago and both feel it was well organized, informative, invigorating & awesome. The walk to the volcano entrance allowed you to really get close to the Icelandic topography that isn't always possible. The trip down into the volcano and stay at bottom revealed magnificent colors and a layered history of Iceland. Make sure you have good walking footwear for the uneven path. They do supply raincoats if you don't have your own gear.As a bonus when we arrived back on the surface the staff had soup ready for all.  It was so good I got the receipt. The typical Icelandic weather probably helped how good it  was to have soup at that time.I highly recommend this tour."
Magical Adventure,"Beautiful views and interesting tour. Delicious soups at the end of the tour. The hike was medium difficulty, but very enjoyable. Rain coats were provided. Highly recommended!"
Excellence Experience,"This was one of the highlights of our trip to Iceland.  Even the drive to the lodge was beautiful.  It is a gorgeous 45 minute walk each way, and the team kept the activity moving.  It is expensive but it was worth it.  My 13 year thought it was amazing.  Better than Fortnight!"
Perfect adventure,"I did this with my family on the next day of our arrival to Iceland.  Could not have picked better.  Not too far from Reykjavik and a fun trip.  You walk for about 30-40 minutes on a rocky but flat ground to the volcano.  Easy and nice walk.  Then you go down the volcano and learn all about it.  Staff is very nice and knowledgable.  Finally, you get this great soup that just makes your day.  Take this trip, you will enjoy!"
Inside the Volcano was amazing!,"This experience was an awesome addition to an already great trip to Iceland!  Yes it's expensive and yes it's a good chunk of your day - but you'll be smiling for days after you do it!I was a little apprehensive about the height, but turned out that I was never scared.  I can also be claustrophobic at times, but never felt that way inside the volcano.  All the staff were very nice and patient to answer everyone's questions.  The pickup service went well (the Gray Line bus was already there when I arrived so that was nice).  They take you to the Gray Line bus depot where you get on an Inside the Volcano van for the ride.  The hike to the volcano was not bad(I'm 55 and in ""ok"" shape), there's a guide in front that goes a little faster for those that want more of a brisk hike and one in the back for those that go slower.  Also, for those that are curious, there are restrooms available before you start the hike and again at base camp at the foot of the volcano."
Bucket list excursion.  Highly reccomended.,Great adventure if you like seeing things we rarely get to see or do in person.  It is not inexpensive but is well worth it.  Even got to see a baby fox.  Take your good camera and not just your cell phone.
Inside the volcanoe Iceland,An absolute magnificent trip! The company does everything to make this experience the best. The walk is quite a hike but doeable even as an older couple in good shape. The actual descent is like nothing else. Safety first is clear. The commentary during the experience is excellent and no one should miss this. The soup was delicious and the team so professional and welcoming.Don’t miss this. Highlight of our Baltic experience.
"High adventure, deep under ground!","This was easily the highlight of our week in Iceland. The weather was perfect for Iceland: cool, with moisture and a steady wind. The hike is breath taking along a well laid out path through the lava field complete wit Lava tubes and channels that align with the continental rift some 70km away. It was clear enough we could see that park. Base Camp is lovely with a quick coffee then we climbed the volcano. The view of Reykjavik was breathtaking. Then we climbed aboard the abseiling basket which is similar to those used to wash the windows of sky scrapers. The 120meters (400ft) trip down into the magma chamber is exhilarating. The colours burnt into the rock clearly show the fissures, the sulfur, the copper... it really makes you see, understand and appreciate the chemical reactions that are happening when a volcano is erupting. This adventure should be taken over some of the other... trivial things Iceland offers. Skip the hot blue water thing, and come see this volcano. This is the only place on Earth where you can go into a volcano like this."
Unique Experience!,"We had a terrific time on this tour!  Our guides were extremely knowledgeable. Descending into the magma chamber was truly an unforgettable experience.  We had plenty of time to explore once inside the volcano.  Great hospitality at base camp!  Definitely a ""must see"" when exploring Iceland."
"Stop The World, I Want To Get Off!","We had an absolutely incredible day, and we did get off the world. This may be one of the great experiences of our life, and no YouTube video could have replaced it. The staff was superlative.  I am a 70 year old, old fart, and while the walk was a little trying, it was completely doable.  You could keep virtually any pace you wanted and the guide periodically stopped for all to catch up.Safety was a paramount issue and everything was done with that as the first priority. With that said, the ride down into the volcano was breathtaking and the lift operator was adept at making those with fear of heights, falling, or just melting, quite at ease.  The views at the bottom were breathtaking and the explanation by our guide was comprehensive and knowledgeable. On return, we were served a delicious soup and even managed a very, very close encounter with a very young fox!  I couldn't finish without any criticism so here goes.  The soup would have been much better with a slice of that thick crusty Icelandic bread. That way we could have skipped a $150 per person (not really an exaggeration) dinner.  Seriously, if you've spent the money to come here go the extra million and do this excursion, it was a once in a lifer."
Unforgettable Experience!,"Inside The Volcano was a wild, but memorable experience. It is one of my favorite memories from my trip to Iceland! First, the staff was incredible. They are hilarious, and they make sure you are comfortable every step of the way.Unfortunately, we endured this experience in poor weather, so it was definitely something I will never forget because of trying to walk in the pouring rain and high winds. So, make sure to ALWAYS check the weather. If you're feeling adventurous, just make sure to wear rain pants and come prepared to get a little bit soaked. Overall, I loved going inside the volcano because the tour guides gave us awesome information about it, made sure we were safe before going down, and provided us with a view like no other. Truly something spectacular for any age. Get ready for the hike of a lifetime if you do it, because it's worth every penny!"
Unique Experience and Great Tourguides,I was incredibly impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of the tour guides and the experience itself. Going inside the magma chamber of an inactive volcano is just incredible. The set up of the elevator and being able to walk around inside is surreal. The traditional soup afterwards felt hospitable. They give you protection gear. The walk through the lava fields was educational but not as necessary. You also have to wait  for everyone to finish before the return to the parking site.
Incredibly Unique,"My husband and I like to celebrate our anniversary each year with something more exciting than a nice restaurant; travelling to the Prihnukagigur volcano was the best anniversary yet.  And for any adventurous couples planning their wedding, I urge you to consider this amazing location!!!!"
Lifetime experience ,"I was definitely impressed. The operation was so well done and smooth. The thike was amazing, very easy 40 minute hike with breathtaking view. The volcano was marvelous . It’s a different world in there. And best of all, our tour guides. They took care of us from the beginning of our journey to the end and even sang us a song at the end of the tour! Well done team Inside the Volcano! Jackie- centerhotels thingholt"
Once-in-a-lifetime adventure ,"Inside the Volcano is just as adventurous and unique as it sounds; you truly experience a life altering trip. The company offers pick-up at certain locations but also allows you to drive yourself to the main building. The staff is all so genuine and they are extremely well-equipped to lead. They provide long rain coats if you’re climbing in bad weather and there are 2 guides for each group. The walk is about 2 miles up to the “base camp” where coffee, water, and heaters can be found. After the short break, the staff helps harness and prep for the lowering into the volcano itself. The walk is 100% worth it!! You get to spend half an hour in the volcano, which is lit up spectacularly, and then return to “base camp” for lamb soup. Even though the weather wasn’t ideal, our trip was still made amazing. This is a day I’ll never forget."
Only chance to dive into that volcano!,"Apparently this is just about the only volcano in the world you can go inside of. We didn't hike through the volcano like I imagined, but that was mainly due to my lack of knowledge of how volcanic eruptions and structures work. This tour was one of the favorite parts of my Iceland trip. If you're looking for something adventurous, this is a great choice."
"Extremely difficult hike in high wind and rain, sopping wet shoes and pants, check the weather.  ","$400 each for 20 minutes inside the volcano.  Most of the time is spent walking/hiking to and from the base camp near the volcano.  Guides and base camp staff were very patient and helpful.  They were wonderful.  However I think the company should take into account the weather factors and how much more difficult it makes the hike.  I walk 3 miles 4-5 x a week.  I am in very good shape.  At least I thought I was until this hike .   Not used to walking on lava and in high wind and driving rain that I thought at times would blow me over.   We had full length rubber raincoats on but it did not prevent water from soaking my pants and shoes and socks.  I wanted to enjoy the scenery such as it was, but I couldn’t see out of my glasses from the rain.  And it was all I could do to keep my eyes down to watch the trail so I didn’t trip and fall.  Only once did we make ourselves stop to take a picture. Once we got to the base camp after the hike, I had to remove my socks and wring them out...also my gloves and pants. One of the staff took pity on me as the bottom half of both my legs had red welts and hives from the wet fabric rubbing on my lower legs.  She took my pants and put them in the dryer and loaned me a pair of hers as well as rain pants.  We had to buy dry socks and put plastic bags over them before donning our soaking wet shoes.  Then we went into the volcano.  Another 15 minute hike up rocky lava and steep steps while gripping a rope to keep from being blown off the trail!  I was so frightened.   The ride down on the window washer device was easy but I was so exhausted and shaken I couldn’t enjoy anything.  I think I was in shock actually.  The helmet had a tiny inadequate flashlight on it which didn’t really help at all.   Also I was thinking that soon we had to go back on that trail and back into the high wind and driving rain to get back on the bus.  Would this torture ever end?  The area down below was so dangerous for walking.  No hand holds.  And my legs were still quivering from the hike.  Awful.  Thank goodness for the guides who helped me hike the last 20 minutes of the trail back to the waiting bus.  I want to emphasize again how wonderful they were.I would tell anyone thinking of doing this to check on the weather on the volcano, wear rain pants and boots, or more simply...don’t go.  Don’t waste your money and watch the YouTube video instead."
Terrific,"We are a couple in our 60’s who did this tour on 16th July 2018.  It was brilliant - very well organised and always put safety first.  We had a perfect weather day, a fantastic guide, a brisk walk to and from the volcano, on-time transfers etc, but the very best part was of course, down inside the volcano. The ride down and later coming up again is smooth and seems much less than 6 minutes. The colours inside the volcano are rich and varied. Yes, you could say it’s expensive - but there is no other tour like it.  Total outing time hotel/hotel was 5 hours - an afternoon well spent in our opinion."
Unique experience,The Inside the vulcano tour is a unique experience. It’s well organized with pick up at your hotel in Reykjavik. It starts with a walk through the Lava field to a cabin where you get prepared for the descending into the crater of the vulcano. You go down in a small group so you have the time and chance to take pictures and experience the crater without being disturbed by anyone else. Although it’s expensive it’s worth it for this once in a lifetime experience. I would recommend it!
Amazing!,"This is seriously one of the highlights of our trip!  No where in the world can you experience this.  In 2010, National Geographic made the first trip down.  2012 first tourists.  So, you are one of the few that have had this experience.  The team is also first class.  Two thumbs up!"
Once in a lifetime experience!,"A very unique scenery! :) The staff was simply amazing and kind.We enjoyed the hike up to the to Volcano and the view from inside was simply stunning!I have never seen anything similar!!The guides were nice, full of knowledge and extremely kind!They took care of us during the whole tour and made us feel very safe and looked after :)They also offered us a delicious traditional Icelandic soup, very well prepared!!I would definitely recommend this tour!!"
Once in a lifetime experience!,"We went INSIDE a volcano!  What an amazing experience.  Yes, it is a little pricey, but there is no where else on earth you can actually go down into a volcano magma chamber.  This was one of the highlights of our trip to Iceland.  Even the hike to get to the volcano was incredible, 45 minutes over lava fields, like being on another planet.  Then you get to base camp and suit up for the descent down into the volcano on this tiny metal/glass platform.  Once inside you'll see incredible colors and rock formations, and our guide Einar was really interesting and informative.  We learned alot about volcanoes and geology. What an amazing experience, I recommend it to everyone."
Just too expensive for what it is,"This tour costs $40,000 ISK or so. Basically, you get a lift to the track, walk about 3k to the volcano, take an elevator down and then have 30 minutes below ground. You don’t really see much more than in a decent cave."
Amazing and unique experience!,"Inside the Volcano is a truly amazing and unique experience!  My husband, myself and our 19 year old son absolutely loved it!  The tour is extremely well run by experienced, friendly, informative guides. Booking was easy on the web site.  Tour guides were fantastic. The path through the lava field to get to the warming hut at the base of the volcano is interesting even by itself.  It is not a difficult walk (about 40-45 minutes) and fairly flat on a gravel path with some rocks jutting through. One very strong recommendation is to either have your own rain gear (including pants) or borrow their long raincoats.  Do not just wear a regular length rain coat with jeans - my son found that out the hard way!  The weather is often rainy and very windy during the walk to the volcano.  We looked at wind and rain as part of the Iceland experience so it did not bother us.  Also we were very glad we had hiking boots.  The journey into the volcano was very interesting as you descend down on a safe platform with 5 others at a time.  I am usually very nervous around heights but was fine on this tour because the guide gave us lots of information about the rock layers we were descending through so you end up not really looking down (unless you want to).  Once inside the volcano, you can walk around on the rocky path to look at the ""walls"" up close. We had about 30 minutes inside the volcano which was a perfect amount of time to walk around and ask questions of the tour guide.  Then its back up on the platform and a short walk to the warming hut for delicious, homemade lamp soup.  There is a bathroom at the warming hut.  You then walk back on the same gravel path through the lava field.  Amazing experience and well worth it!  Definitely a highlight of our trip!!"
"A truly unique experience, and a well-run tour","It's not every day that you get to go inside a volcano! Echoing previous reviews, the weather was rainy and windy but raincoats available. The guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. A delicious lamb soup was served. Highly recommended!"
Amazing and must do experience ,"Magic and really safe. Friendly guide. quiet and respectful organisation...🙏My 11 yo son loved it. The walk is nice and the pace adapted to people...No fear at all, just do it !!!😍you will not regret it"
Overall great experience,My husband and I participated in this tour and we are so happy we did. The weather was rainy and windy but they had long raincoats available (xs-xl). They also had harnesses (for going down the volcano) available for bigger bodies. The guides were great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. A delicious lamb soup was served (a veg option was available).
Unique experience,"This was a great (albeit expensive) tour. I enjoyed the hike to the volcano, but prepared for inclement weather. We were also served delicious lamb soup after the trip down into the volcano. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!"
A wonderful and memorable experience,"It's exactly what it says and if you really want to do it, you should do it.  Where else would you get to go 400' down into a volcano? And yes, it costs more than you think it should.  There is a mild guided hike to and from the volcano, taking 35 to 50 minutes each way based on if you walk fast or slow.  Does the volcano still erupt ?  Don't worry, there is an 'Erupt On/Off' switch on the outside that is always Off.... ;-)"
Great Time!,"This was a great tour!  It was a 3km hike in over amazing landscape and then, 3km back.  Follow the clothing guidelines.  They provide excellent rain coats, but your lower legs and feet can get soaked, so solid water proof hiking boots and pants were key.  The staff were awesome.  The stew was magnificent.  Of a week in Reykjavik, this was my 18 year old daughter's favorite excursion."
Iceland Trip,This unique experience to get the opportunity to go inside a volcano and experience all the rock formations and color is something that everyone visiting Iceland should experience. The  walk of about 3km to get to the staging area is a nice hike and the guides do a good job of explaining the history of the area and the volcano. The six minute ride into the volcano via a high rise window washing like platform is just a fabulous ride deep down into the earth. You have a chance to walk around and experience all the beauty the volcano has to offer and then to end your trip you get a nice bowl of soup to help warm you up for the return hike back to the starting point.
Worth every penny.,"Amazing adventure. The folks were super friendly.  The lamb soup was yummy!  Follow the suggestions for clothing, etc."
Unforgetable,"It was my partner’s 40th birthday and this trip was a part of my birthday present to him. We are Icelanders, living in Reykjavik which is only about 20 minutes away from the volcano, but we decided to be tourists in our own “backyard”. We took the bus which was on time, and the ride to the volcano was quite pleasant. After a 3 km hike (on a fairly even ground) we reached the cabin that is used as “base camp”. There we were offered tea, coffee and water before going into the crater. The group (of 17 people) was split into smaller groups before going down to the volcano. On the way down we were asked what brought us there, as it is not very common that Icelanders go on this excursion. I mentioned that it was my partner’s birthday and that this was his present. Once we were down in the crater we were blown away by the colours and the shapes of the lava, it is extraordinary. We got between 30-40 minutes in the crater, the time flew because there was so much to see. Once we came back to the cabin, my partner was greeted with a birthday hat, a birthday “cake” (a candy roll with a birthday candle) and a birthday song. We then got traditional Icelandic lamb soup. This was an unforgetable day, made so much more special by the guides and the staff. Tips: take good walking shoes, warm and waterproof clothes (this is Iceland, there is a good chance of rain) and a good camera (you will want to have pictures and phone cameras will not be any good with the light in the crater).Takk kærlega fyrir okkur, þessi ferð er ógleymanleg og maðurinn minn talaði sérstaklega um hvað hann hafði gaman af móttökunum þegar við komum aftur í skálann. Mæli með þessari ferð við hvern þann sem vill hlusta :-)"
Interesting experience,It is a 2+ mile hike which is relatively flat until you get near the volcano when it is uphill. They provide raincoats if it is raining. Would recommend waterproof pants if raining or chilly since the wind is more severe there as well as hiking boots. The inside of the volcano is dark but they do give you a hat with a light.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,"It was an amazing experience and well worth the 3km hike across the lava field to get to basecamp.  We happened to take a tour when the weather was rainy and very windy, making the 3 km hike ""exciting."" The tour is well organized with strong attention to safety.  We were very impressed with the staff and absolutely loved the 10-minute descent into the volcano.  The colors were spectacular!  All safety gear including helmet, harness and cap lamp are provided by the tour company.  It is suggested to dress warm and if it is raining, wear rain gear."
Awe Inspiring,Into the Volcano is a great trip. The whole experience is well managed culminating in the 30 mins spent inside the volcano chamber. The colours and the shapes of the rocks are spellbinding. The walk to the volcano was in very poor weather but otherwise ok. It would have been positively pleasant in different weather. The descent was handled well with good safe precautions taken. The way you’re lowered in stops you seeing just how high you are. Thoroughly recommended but check the weather and be prepared.
Unique Experience,"It was an amazing experience! Was drenched by the end (thanks, Icelandic weather) - but oh so worth it. Although we were quite a large group overall, we were split into smaller groups for the actual trip down the volcano, which meant that there was space to soak up the ambience and the immensity of being in the bowels of the earth. The trip down the lift was quite something too!On top of the above, the guides were excellent and the operation professionally run."
Incredible!,"This tour was definitely the best tour I have been on during any of my travels! It was spectacular! That said, I did study geology in grad school so I may be a bit bias. However, the sites within the volcano should appeal to everyone. The price point was high so I was nervous to pull the trigger on this tour but I am glad I did. I have no regrets. I will let some of my pictures wrap up this review for me."
Stunning Experience!,"Inside the volcano is one of the honestly once-in-a-lifetime things to do. Sure, it's expensive but, when you consider what's involved in the infrastructure and the fact that it is in Iceland, where everything is expensive, it's a price worth paying. It is visually and physically exciting. The walk across the lava field is neat and the short walk to the volcano entrance builds the event. The descent is amazing. Once you've reached the bottom, you are free to roam within the perimeter that has been set up. The colors are vivid and you get a nice explanation of their cause. The whole operation is run by friendly and professional people. There is even rain gear provided for those who need it. We like volcanoes and have traveled quite a bit to see them, but this is the first we've been been inside!"
Tour Inside the volcano,Amazing experience beeing into the magma chamber.Easy to.take pictures inside .Nice and easy hike to get there
Worth the investment!,Inside the Volcano was a great experience.   We've traveled to Iceland previously and had exhausted most of the typical tours.  This was great.  A nice hike to the warming hut (long raincoats provided) and then suited up in the safety gear and down we went.   30 minutes inside doesn't sound like a lot but it is just one cavern and it's plenty of time to take in the beauty...and lots of photos.  I don't really like soup but the vegetable soup and lamb soup were delicious.   We walked back to main building on our own so there was plenty of time for more photos and enjoying the scenery
"A unique experience, worth every penny","We stumbled across this whilst booking our recent trip to Iceland, it was barely mentioned in the guidebooks, but when we found it we had to go.We drove ourselves to the meeting point, and were led by a very informative guide up to the 'base camp'.  Here we had our safety briefing, warm drinks, and then headed up to the top to go 'inside the volcano'.  And afterwards there was a very tasty soup!At every stage, the staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  At the bottom of the chamber, the lighting has been carefully thought out, so you can see the most amazing colours that naturally occur in the rock.  It was just stunning!Yes, it is a little expensive, but as my partner said ( a typical Yorkshireman who can often be heard saying ""'ow much?!""), it was absolutely worth every penny!"
Worth the time and money,"This tour was amazing.   I’ll admit that it started out weak...we drove ourselves and the bus bringing other guests was late.  The person at the main lodge was not terribly friendly, there was no TP in the bathroom, and I wondered if I made a bad investment,   However, once we got started it was great.   The hike across the lava field was nice- the time inside the volcano was excellent!   Afterwards we enjoyed the lamb soup.    It was a high point of our trip"
Once in a lifetime experience ,It is quite an experience to be able to visit the inside of a volcano.  Everyone in the crew is very professional.  I also enjoyed the walk to the volcano from the base camp (with fair weather on that day) and the traditional Icelandic meat soup after visiting the magma chamber.
Breathtaking & exciting experience!!,It's a wonderful experience to go inside a volcano and stay so close to the centre of the earth. Thanks to all the excellent guides. Highly recommended.
Out of this world!,"The trip inside the volcano blew my mind away. It's been a few days now and I still can't quite believe I've been inside a real volcano! It's breathtaking, awe-inspiring and spine-tingling and at the same time unreal as you feel as if you've been to a different planet. At the same time, you really feel you've been to the centre of the earth. That isn't just because of the experience inside the volcano; the hike across the lava field, in the mountains (and inside a cloud when we were there) really adds to the experience. I think the organisers could make a lot more of that hike in their advertising. It turned out it included crossing a gap between the tectonic plates so we could actually stand with a foot on each plate. That was a pleasant surprise, as we had expected to experience that at the Thingvellir national park, but were a bit disappointed that there the plates were 6km apart. And then suddenly we get this experience as an added bonus - Inside the Volcano team, you should really upsell that :-).The team were brilliant. They all seemed like young, Icelandic pioneers expertly guiding us through their almost alien nature. I loved the basecamp pit stop and the feeling of a hiking community there.Just one small glitch: it wasn't clear in any of the information that the bus journey from Reykjavik was only a bit more than half an hour. That was great of course (another point that could be upsold, considering how long some of the coach trips are) but it would have been nice to have known that so we could have been ready on arrival with our waterproofs etc. on. The bus driver didn't give any information at all during the journey (it might have been nice to have been told a bit about the landscape) and as a result it was a bit of a scramble for us to get ready for the hike. But that is just a detail and I'm now telling everyone they must go to Iceland and do this trip!"
Must See!!! Breathtaking!!!,"If you do only one thing in Iceland, you must go to “Inside the Volcano.” It is the only place in the world where you can go inside a volcano and it’s an unforgettable, once in a lifetime experience! The colors - from the different minerals -are vibrant and spectacular. Our guide, Vidir, was absolutely amazing and so informative. He was one of the mountaineers who explored this volcano before it became a tourist attraction. While I love a lot about Iceland, this was the one tour I was looking forward to the most and, to say it was the highlight of our trip, is an understatement. You can either do the 2-mile walk to the volcano and back or take a helicopter. We took the helicopter and I’m so glad we did. While it was double the price, it was worth every penny plus more. The tour groups in general are small anyway which is great - 9 people go down at a time - but my husband and I were the only ones flying over, so we ended up getting a private tour of the volcano, which was incredible! The volcano folks work with Nordurflug Helicopter Tours. It was my first time in a helicopter and the pilot was terrific!  Also, at base camp after the tour, you must try their homemade lamb soup, which is amazing. They also have a vegetable soup option. This tour should be a MUST SEE on everyone’s list!!!"
Once in a lifetime,"We booked our tour a couple of months in advance. We had no problems there. However the weather was not so great. Very foggy and rainy. Be prepared to hike a 1,7mile path, on rocky terrain. Bring hiking shoes and waterproof/windproof clothing. The hike to the volcano had some impressive scenery. We had a nice guide too, who was happy to answer all our questions. At the end of the gike you arrive  at basecamp. A (hot and cozy) cabin, where they serve lamb soup. Which was very welcome! The volcano was simply beautiful, impressive, ... I would surely recommend this to my friends! Since this is the only place in the world where you can see this type of volcano."
Big win,Strongly recommend you take this trip. It’s aExpensive but worth it. The walk over to the volcano is long but beautiful and very easy even for an oldie like me. Once inside you understand so much more about our earth and just how it works! Inside it is a little tricky walking around but easy for young people. I think a must do beautiful.
This is a tale of two tours. ,"On the 5 star side... it’s a once in a lifetime experience that you will never forget. Not only do you have the chance to go inside a volcano, but the layers of rock are spectacular to look at. The walk out to the volcano is peaceful and scenic. The guides are warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. On the 1 star side... it was an almost 8 hour tour that was 2 1/2 hours of activity. The rest was waiting around. The disorganization is not what you would expect when you pay $400. The guide was 30 min late on arrival. The group was too big so there was sitting and waiting for over 90 min while everyone got to experience the chamber. Most disappointing, on the return to Reykjavík, the shuttle bus driver took all the employees home so they could go to an employee party and me (a paying guest) was the very, very last person on the bus. Bottom line: 1. Would I do it again? Yes, but... if the company had a higher focus on organization, things would be worlds better.2. Don’t make 7:30 dinner reservations for a tour that starts at 12:30 pm. You won’t make them."
YOU CAN'T MISS THIS!!!,"This Icelandic adventure was amazing!!! Yes, it is expensive, but it is definitely value for money spent.You start by driving or being driven to a parking lot where you set off with your guides (one at the front/one at the back) after being fitted out in a yellow slicker (if needed because of rain) for the 3km walk to the base camp at the foot of the volcano. This walk is through lava fields, more or less flat, on a path. With decent weather, this walk would be beautiful and easy...but with the stormy weather we experienced, it was tough. Outfitted in our yellow slickers, we set out, but before many steps, our supposedly waterproof shoes were completely soaked!!! The wind was gusting behind us and the rain was coming in at an angle! There was no opportunity to take pictures because of the weather. Being seniors, we were the last in our group, but we were not rushed in the walk by Stephanie, our 'rear' guide. If anything, she was encouraging us to take our time.Once we arrived at the base camp, we had an opportunity to sit, relax and have a hot drink. While doing that, the base camp staff were telling us about going down into the volcano, safety harness and gave us a unique souvenir head bandana  to use under the safety helmet we wore. From the base camp to the top of the volcano was about a 5 minute or so walk, all uphill, not difficult, but not easy peasy either. There is a rope 'handrail' to use which was very much needed due to the gusting winds. Descent into the volcano via a window washing platform takes about 6 minutes down and then up again. They take about 6 adventurers at a time, plus a guide and platform operator. Once down, you have about 30 minutes at the bottom of the volcano to explore and admire the environment.They have some lights fitted down there so that you can see more easily the beautiful  rock formations. It is quite something to be down there where 'fire' once raged and see what it left behind...definitely a magical experience.Once up at the top again, it is the short walk down to the base camp, but challenging with the gusting winds. One definitely needed to hold on to the rope 'handrail'.Back in the base camp, we were given a delicious bowl of traditional lamb soup, and without doubt this was the best one of our time in Iceland. We both love soup, so gobbled it up!The 3 km walk back to the parking lot was, to say the least, brutal. The winds had not changed direction, so now we were walking right into them, plus it was still raining hard. We were already soaked!! so getting a little more wet made no difference.I cannot say enough good things about Obba, our guide who led us back. She literally took my partner by the arm and guided him back, shielding him from the wind as needed for short breaks. Once back to the parking lot building we were able to rest, again have a warm drink, before being driven back to Reyjkavik.I don't think the weather conditions for us could have been any worse, but we were able to manage, with help and support of the guides, the adventure. Everyone of the Inside the Volcano staff were fantastic, wonderful and truly exceptional in their love of their job.If two seniors, the oldest 82, can experience this adventure in the worst of conditions, I reckon just about anybody should be able to take up the challenge, especially with more favorable weather.Of all the experiences we had while in Iceland, for sure this is the one we will be remembering the most.Our sincere thanks to Obba, Stephanie for all their help, and to Brinsi who made the soup!!And, by the way, if you are wondering what you can do with the head bandana you are given, think about making a 'kidney' cushion out of it, works fantastic!!"
Wow,"Wonderful experience, a little pricey but we'll worth it. Just stunning once you get to the bottom. We brought a family of 6 and everyone just loved it."
A unique adventure,"If you love volcanoes as much as I do, this is for you. My family offered me a trip down inside for my 40th birthday. The little hike to the volcano is manageable, a bit tough maybe in high winds. But base camp takes good care of you and is a welcomed break to help you realize what you are about to experience. The descent into the volcano is magical. Colours inside are unbelievable. The experience is unique. The staff is very reassuring and outstandingly friendly. They warm you up with a nice warm soup at base camp afterwards and answer all your questions. I really enjoyed this trip and would recommend this to all those who are curious about nature and its wonders."
ATTN: Adventure Seekers-This is a MUST DO on your bucket list (Recommended by @wander_whereweare on Instagram),"Recommendation from @wander_whereweare (Follow us on Instagram for more adventures).....If you seek the ultimate level of adventure, then look no further. This tour is an epic discovery that has only been happening since 2010. The tour is truly ""Inside The Volcano"" and is the only volcano in the WORLD you can descend into. The 45-min hike to the top of the volcano's opening is a fantastic journey all its own. You feel like you are on the ultimate trek and witness to the most stunning landscape that embodies the beautiful country of Iceland. Once at base camp, you are hosted by amazing staff that make you feel like family. We traveled with our 2 year and had to get special permission to bring her, and the staff welcomed her with open arms and hearts. You are given rain suits which help to keep you warm and dry and they even give you scarves for your head to add comfort for the head gear. The descent into the volcano is one that cannot be explained only experienced, but believe me it is a once in a lifetime story you will want to add to your book of life. The experience is humbling and priceless. Once on the floor of the inside of the volcano you get 30 min to explore. It is a moment to meditate and contemplate the true natural wonders of the world. We were so grateful to the incredible and knowledgeable team that hosted us. They truly made this one of the greatest travel stories we will tell for a lifetime...I mean...Not many people can say they have traveled to the center of the Earth inside a volcano."
Amazing experience,Is it expensive? Very. Is it worth it? Heck YES !Guide and people on the site were extremely friendly and gladly answered questions.Crater was visually stunning and the way down was a lot of fun. Would recommend without a doubt.
Absolutely beautiful!,"We did the Inside the Volcano tour on Jun/21 at 10am. It is just as beautiful as any of the pictures you see online. It's about a 45 min walk to and from a small lodge near the entrance of the volcano. The weather the day we went was awful, rainy and very windy but they provide rain slickers which I highly recommend using if it's raining the day you go. You get about 30 mins inside the volcano to walk around and take pictures, the colours are truly amazing. Afterwards, they take you back to the lodge and they offer drinks and soup which was delicious (they even had a vegan option which was a nice surprise). All the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. This tour was worth the price, a once in a lifetime experience."
Raw and riveting,"Outstanding experience.  Extremely well organized.  Enjoyed every moment from hiking across the lava, chatting with the informative fun guide, exploring the depths of the volcano, to eating the soup.  Pricy but you can't do this anywhere else in the world.  Travelled with 11 and 14 year old kids - they're fairly fit and did it no problem.  Strongly recommended."
Amazing experience,Great attraction! The trip into and out of the volcano was a highlight. You spend about 45 minutes in the magma chamber which is more than enough time to explore it fully. Waiting for you when you come out is hot soup made by the guides - a delight!
Truly unique in the world - but be prepared,"It's really a unique attraction--the only known empty magma chamber (the lava went up the same way you're coming in) in the WORLD. But it's the little touches that made it stand out as an attraction. They serve you great, homemade hot soup after you tour the volcano (it was pouring rain with gale force winds so we all really needed it). They're very accommodating of groups (they walked side-by-side with some elderly visitors on our trip) and extremely professional no matter the conditions. If you have rain, the hike up to the Volcano is 2K, very exposed and was the biggest wind we encountered in South Iceland. Wear wool socks or you'll be walking in puddles (as happened to a couple people in our group) Take them up on the long, water-proof jacket no matter what. The weather can get bad fast and the hike in and out isn't short. Also, it's cold in the Volcano no matter what the weather outside, so bring warm layers so you can enjoy the amazing sights."
Volcano,"We got dropped off by helicopter at the site. We were greeted as we got off and escorted inside where we received instructions on how to put on our gear and not to take rocks from inside the volcano. When our group was called we had a short walk up the hill and walked across a short bridge to the lift for the slow decent into the volcano. No elevator music was played, which was good.At the bottom one of the guides gave us some scientific information on how this cavity was formed. We were then able to walk around and not pick up rocks.This was a beautiful sight. Awesome. When we got back to the headquarters, we were treated to some great soup. We chose the vegetarian option. Delicious."
Inside the Volcano - Put it on your bucket list.,"We travelled from Australia to visit Iceland and we targeted the Inside the Volcano excursion as our number one priority and it certainly met, and definitely exceeded our expectations.I don’t process the volcabularly  to adequately describe what you will see and personally experience; suffice to say it was   absolutely  awesome,What I can comment on is the Staff; they are knowledgable, fit, friendly and truly make all feel welcome and part of the experience; not just a select few.  Congratulations to them as their all encompassing nature made for a very rewarding day.If you visit Iceland, put this trip at the top of your list; if you don’t, you will regret it."
Amazing Unique Experience if you can afford it!,"We went inside the volcano and it was an truly unique experience. We met at base camp and walked about an hour with our guide who was very friendly and knowledgeable. The weather was raw but they had long 66 north hooded rain coat that kept us warm and dry. The walk is among an apocalyptic landscape and you feel you are on your own science fiction adventure. The descent down the magma chamber is impressive and the color inside it are simply incredible. This is definitively a bucket list thing to do. You spend about 30+ minutes in the chamber but I wish we had more time. The place feels totally surreal. After the ascent, base camp will offer you a delicious lamb or vegetarian soup. We loved the experience. It is an expensive activity but if you can afford it, I would recommend it."
Amazing,"The experience of being inside a volcano is unique!You can choose two options to get to the meet up point, a pick up bus that takes you there or to drive. If you drive, google maps has the exact location and the road is in excellent conditions.When you get there, some amazing guides will give you instructions and a rain coat if you need it. After that, a 45 minutes hike through a moon like terrain with some guide interventions about interesting facts will take place and you will reach to the base camp, where you can rest a little bit. After that, you can go down and see the Thrihnukagigur volcano from the inside, take some pictures, contemplate, meditate about the beauty of our planet. After some time, go back to the base camp and eat the most delicious soup before going back again to the meet up point. I'll always recommend this tour."
A very unique place operated by very nice and professional people,"Took this tour as part of an 8-day package, with no expectations at all. The guide claimed it was a very unique place, and I hold my judgement until I went down and checked by myself. Well, it is a UNIQUE place, very interesting, full of colors and very professionally operated from the walk across the lava field to the lift taking us inside the magma chamber to the walk inside it. And...then the wonderful hospitality of their staff: free bandana with their logo, a delicious lamb soup and then some sweets. Absolutely fantastic.PS: the prices of their Volcano merchandise (t shirts, particularly) are very inviting, compared to the prices all over Iceland.Highly recommended, really.Miguel. Sugar Land Texas"
Nothing like this adventure,"When we arrived at the meeting place for Inside the Volcano, we were warmly greeted and given details for our adventure.  They even offer outer wear if you don't have your own.  I'm glad I had the right clothing and was ready to go.  Then we started our hike to base camp.  At base camp we were given a harness and helmet with light for the journey into the volcano.  Then we were led in small groups to the top of the volcano.  Safety is taken very seriously.  We were harnessed before crossing the short bridge and then harnessed again once on the lift.  The decent into the volcano is amazing.  It goes from a narrow opening to a wide area with the most amazing sights imaginable.  We had plenty of time to walk around and explore.  Pictures are a must.  This experience is like nothing you have ever had before.  We were so lucky to experience this unbelievable outing.  Once back up and in base camp we were served delicious soup and warm drinks.  Then it's back over the lava fields to the starting point.  So glad I had the opportunity to experience this."
"Incredible experience, worth the money","My partner and I went to this while on vacation. It was truly awesome, in the original sense of the word :) With our guides, we hiked to the volcano, put on safety gear, and descended via lift into the mountain. Soon enough we were inside a gigantic dome of stone, where magma had once been. There were lights illuminating the walls, the rocks a rainbow of color because of the oxidized metals on their surfaces. The sheer scale of the space boggled my mind and despite many attempts, none of my pictures quite captured how huge it is. It truly seemed like we had traveled to another world; our only connection to the outside was a tiny shaft of light coming from far, far above.Afterwards, we took the tiny elevator back to the surface, took off our safety gear, relaxed with some soup (lamb and vegetarian options available and included in the ticket price), and hiked back to the drop-off point. The whole experience took us 4+ hours, not including the drive to/from the location. The guides gave us a lot of interesting information about the geology of the area, how the hot spot gave rise to the volcanoes and mountains in the area, and why it is safe to walk inside this particular volcano.I normally don't wax poetic in reviews, but this was a special experience, and I want to emphasize how special it was given the pretty high price ($400 / person). I also want to mention that the hike, over a lava field to get to the volcano and back, isn't super strenuous, but is definitely a bit of a workout, and that going down and up the open elevator box with just a rail and a safety harness protecting you in a tiny shaft for several minutes can feel a bit scary if you don't like heights / enclosed spaces. That said, I think Inside the Volcano is absolutely worth it if you can make it work!"
Wonderful,"Don't miss this experience!  A little pricey but well worth it.  We were fortunate to have clear weather and the views were amazing before we even got into the volcano.  It's a longish trek so bundle up if it's chilly.  The inside of the volcano is beautiful, and the guides were very informative and friendly.  Plus some hot soup at the end!   Grade it an A+."
Laura M.,"This is a must to do while visiting Iceland!!!! I will admit it is pricey but worth every penny!!  We had a great tour guide who new her stuff and extremely pleasant.  It is a hike across the volcano and then to the top but just pace yourself and you will make it ... they don't rush you and they do make a few stops to point out things and give some history on the way so it gives a you a break.  I highly recommend using the long yellow rain coats they provide because not only do they protect you from the rain, which it does a lot in Iceland but it gives you an extra layer to protect you from the wind, which is constant. I highly recommend you get yourself a pair of hiking shoes/boots ... no sneakers.   You are split up in groups of like 6 to 8 and get on a platform similar to what they use for window washing and then you are lowered into the chamber.  The colors are unbelievable inside.  Your are able to follow the roped path once down inside but you will need to climb over rocks through out the entire path ... well worth the effort to do it but not to worry if you can't climb over the rocks because you can stand where you get off the lift and enjoy the view from there.  It is just amazing to be able to experience such a thing ... it gives you a better understanding on how a volcano acts. We had 30 plus minutes to explore once we were inside.   I would highly recommend doing this over anything else while in Iceland ... apparently it is the only one in the world you can go down inside.  My understanding is the tours book up quickly so I recommend you book your tour as soon as you book your vacation ... that is what we did.  One gentleman on our tour was saying he was in Iceland a couple years ago and was unable to do the tour because it was booked so he came back this time just to be able to go inside the volcano."
Amazing trip,"Amazing experience! Once at the top, it is so exciting to be lowered down into the volcano.  Seeing all the magma splashes and mineral deposits were unreal. Very attentive staff and guides. The Icelandic Soup was perfect to warm with. The walk from the check in center is through a lava field, where the view is amazing,  on a rainy day offers no protection from the extreme wind and rain.  We were drenched. You need warm and waterproof clothing and shoes. This is very important! It's a long walk up hill in the cold.  My limited athletic ability made it,  but I stop very often.  Still worth the climb.  Amazing"
"One time in your life, you should spent the money.","This is a one time experience. I dońt think i will do it again.Because I‘ve seen it and it is a lot of money.The most time you are walking. to the volcano and back to the camp house. The time inside is just a small part.But this was amazing. The coloring, the atmosphere, the down and up driving.I don‘t regret it and I would recommend it.We came with our own car and after the lamp soup we could go back on our own. We were so lucky this day because during the walks we didn‘t had any rain. Just strong side winds but this was ok. On the way there were still snow fields. Wear trecking shoes.At the starting point we still got some free coffee and tea,nobody was looking at you and chased younout. We calmed a little bit down and headed back to reykjavik."
Impressive,"If you have the imagination its awesome! We had a perfecr day over there. Sunny weather, able to see 100km to glacier on snaeffnelsen."
