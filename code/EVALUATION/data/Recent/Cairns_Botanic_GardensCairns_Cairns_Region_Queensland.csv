Great Day A Lot To See,We enjoyed our morning here. If you're into gardens you will enjoy it. We couldn't find the Saltwater Lake but the rest was very good.
Beautiful,"We spent over 2 hours waking the sounds and still didn't see it all (after the school holidays,  so very peaceful,  and very few people). The Watkins Munro Martin Conservatory was a great highlight.  Photos taken on Samson mobile (I'm no photographer)."
Stunning,My partner is a horticulturist and he was like a kid in a candy store as there are so many tropical plants that we simply can‚Äôt grow at home. A stunningly beautiful gardens!
Great little playground and walking trails.,"Lots of shady spots to sit. Kids enjoyed the playground- dinosaurs to dig for, water play, climbing cranes and slippery dips ( can get a bit hot in the sun)"
Disappointing,"Unfortunately didn't get to see all of the gardens as the staff told us to leave as we had our dog with us. Travelers with dogs might be best to avoid Cairns as it is not very dog friendly. Dogs are also not allowed on the Esplanade, near the lagoon or any part of the CBD of Cairns. We are grey nomads living permanently on the road so leaving our dog at home is not an option. Also most of the swimming spots and waterfalls are in national parks so obviously can't go there with your dog."
Highly Recommend,"This is a ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù place in Cairns. The gardens are well kept and have a huge variety of beautiful, interesting and extraordinary plants. Give yourself a couple of hours at least. There is a cafe for a bite to eat."
Great place for a walk,"Great place to take a walk and see the various types of vegetation.  Trees, flowers, vines, birds, and fish.  Shady boardwalks.  Hot sunny ponds.  Places to sit and catch your breath.  A good place to walk off the stiff legs from a long flight!"
Green Visual Paradise.,"We visited twice and still didn't touch the sides of these BeautifulBotanical Gardens, there is so much to see and do, and the cafe is a welcome break before you indulge into the greenery again, the multitude of different species is astounding, The best idea is to bring a Picnic lunch to enjoy on the many seats and Lawns in this park.Congratulations  for a wonderful job to  All the Staff of the gardens that make this possible they do such a Demanding Passionate  job  of making us extremely happy after you visit this place of Beauty."
Well worth a visit,"The grounds are absolutely beautiful and really well maintained, the huge variety of plants with their names at the base makes it a great place to visit. There were a few butterflies around which made it even more interesting. It's great to see seats around the grounds so people can sit if need to or sit and reflect. Definitely would visit here again."
Wonderful heritage gardens,"Absolutely loved these gardens, we were staying close by in Edge Hill and could easily walk there so we went every afternoon and did different areas. Loved all of it, but if you only go there once then do the rainforest boardwalk, you feel like you are far away from any city..."
Beautiful,Beautiful and well maintained. Great walking tracks and very accessible for all fitness types and abilities
So beautiful,"Very beautiful, love the centre area with the wide variety of plants and butterflies, just jaw dropping really!"
A must to do,"Amazing, Wonderful place. Only saw a small part on our tour, wished we had more days in Cairns to go back and spend a full day there.Beautiful plants and flowers."
Peaceful oasis in the city,"The Botanic Gardens has a variety of walks including rainforest boardwalk, lakes, ponds and creeks to wander around. Beautifully maintained with wonderful plants and wildlife. Great play areas for the kids and barbecue areas for families."
Situated in two different streets!,"Lovely peaceful walk within these grounds. Seating in shade can be found, and there is a Cafe within. An elevated walkway allows one to comfortably enjoy the tropical rainforest."
Beautiful walks,So many varieties of tropical plants. A joy to walk the trails. Accessible by bus from downtown. There is a cafe on site for coffee or light meals.
Absolutely stunning,"This has to go on your list of to do's in Cairns if you love gardens! The plants, landscaping and paths are a real delight, and cooling to walk through in the heat of the day. There are so many amazing and interesting tropical plants to see. Pets are not allowed, so leave them at day care. The ladies at both of the information centres are lovely and very helpful. The restaurant/cafe serves great tasty food."
Tropical paradise,"We went to Cairns Botanical gardens and had a lovely day . The perfect winter August day was just the right temperature for walking around the lush tropical plants . Parking is good and a very short walk to the first cafe for a very good coffee and fresh fruit juice . The bromilliad garden was my favourite but all the different tropical flowers and trees are great to see . I also loved the butterflies , will come back again for sure."
Cairns' unsung hero for tourism,"To do it justice, you could spend up to two days wandering the tropical experience that is Cairns Botanic Gardens. Central to the city (you can get there on the local 131 bus). A credit to its fouders, the gardens are served by an active ""Friends"" group who provide guided tours. Our guide was Bill, who offered a wealth of information. Also, fulltime staff member Peter in the butterfly house-conservatory gave us a lot of interesting facts and backgrounds. Plenty of wonderful, shady areas and, admission is free. Great coffee shop/restaurant on-site and adjacent at the Tanks Performance Area."
Excellent free attraction,"This is an excellent free attraction and we were a little surprised that the Gardens do not feature more prominently on 'Things to Do in Cairns' listings. Fantastic collection of native and foreign tropical species, very well kept grounds, informative descriptions, themed areas, pleasant lawns, conservatory with butterflies and a handy cafe. Easy to combine with longer boardwalks through native forest and around lakes over the road. Plenty of parking just off the the main road turning, but not so much directly outside main entrance. Could maybe do with a few more posts housing the guided walk leaflets as these are very useful for numbered species descriptions."
What a beautiful place ,"We called in and checked out the Cairns botanic gardens rainforest boardwalkman then moved onto the flecker gardens and visitor centre precincts. The parks are well kept, restful and best of all no admission cost. Go there talk a walk and relax it is beautiful."
Great walks,We were staying at the Cairns colonial club which is within walking distance of these lovely gardens. You would need to visit on more than one occasion to see all of it but it is definitely worth the visit.The information centre is very helpful and the cafe next door has really lovely food and drinks.A very good day out that I would recommend and you can walk as much as you like or as little as you can.
‚Äú Tell me and I forget; Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn‚Äù,"‚Äú Tell me and I forget; Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn‚ÄùBenjamim Franklin is quoted as saying this many years ago but it translates exactly to the tour at the Botanic Gardens tour that I participated in last Wednesday.I had a relaxed, yet enthusiastic morning guided by Barry, who made all the difference in our day, he shared his knowledge about plants and involved us. I learnt a lot about the history of Cairns.  Barry, who works as a volunteer, had charisma and conducted the tour with promptness. He also showed us the diversity and value of this wonderful place. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend going on this tour, especially if you are curious about botanical science like me. I‚Äôm sure you will have a great time too. Esmeralda Amim - Brazil üáßüá∑"
Terrific place to visit,"Allow at least an hour to visit these interesting gardens. Helpful staff, and a great place to take photos."
Great Experience,Barry was a really good and kind guide. He did not just show us plants and butterflies but also the history behind them which made me feel more interested in.Thanks barry and botanical gardens for allowing to have this great experience.
Beautifully maintained tropical gardens - Must see,"Beautifully maintained gardens in a compact area, but still offering a variety of tropical habitats.We'd spent several hundred dollars on a tour to the Daintree a couple of days earlier and to be honest we should have just come here for free. I'm sure the natural rainforests are beautiful if you can get off the beaten track, but let's face it most organised tours don't and can't, so what you're left with is the weed-infested roadside. Far better to come here.We'd bought beautiful fresh made rolls and a coffee two minutes down the road at Victor's Gourmet Delicatessen (can highly recommend) and ate them sitting on a bench, feeling the serenity...."
Jurassic Park with good coffee,"Everything about Cairns Botanic Gardens is bigger, more lush, greener, fernier with massive variety. Bit overwhelming for one morning visit - needs at least a week to begin to appreciate the magnificent plants. Brunch spot in the gardens is idyllic."
"Free to tourists, lovely place.",One of my favourite places to visit in Cairns (restaurant/cafe on site). What is better than free? Nothing! As an ex tour guide I always told my customers of this wonder(so close to the city hotels) I love it sooo much I know live (bought an apartment close by) 10 mins walking distance from the place. Cannot praise enough.
"Beauty, Beyond the i can see","Baz or Barry our quite uniquely styled tour guide this morning was an amazing journey into the beauty of nature beyond what you first see. Barry's amazing story telling and near perfect information on any plant had me fascinated from parent plants that kick there kids out of home by literally exploding there pods, pelting seedlings up to 20 meters in any direction and than using poisonous sap from there leaves to stop there seeds growing under there soil. To the earliest ever primitive Dicot flower.I highly recommend you visit and if you stop by the cafe, i highly recommend the caramel latte"
Amazing nature contact,"I am really grateful with Barry, because he make it great experience, and guide as around the place, sharing stories and very interesting information."
Beautiful tour with great guide! ,"Enjoyed a beautiful tour through the stunning botanic gardens today, gaining lots of interesting knowledge and information by our tour guide Barry! I especially loved all the stories he was telling us relating to interesting facts and the Watkins Munro Martin conservatory!"
Beautiful plants,"I highly recommend this place.There are various plants and I really enjoyed it.And also, I joined a tour and a tour guide has a lot of knowledge and he taught us story about plants.I had a very nice time."
Excellent guided tour!,"We did the walking tour this morning and it was excellent! Barry was our guide and he gave us a lot of information about all the plants we saw. He has showed a lot of knowledge and passion, specially about the microbiology and chemistry processes specific to each plant. It`s always really worth getting a local guide on your tours!"
Informative and overall awesome Tour!,"Was lucky enough to enjoy a quick tour around the gardens with Barry, and i can honestly say i had a fabulous time! So many interesting facts and stories were told which kept the tour exciting and overall the gardens are stunning."
Beautiful display of plants,Spent nearly all day wandering around checking out this wonderful area. It has an outstanding variety of plants from all over the world.
All things bright and beautiful,"A Sunday afternoon stroll through the beautiful botanical gardens will certainly relieve stress, anxiety and worry. The conservitorium with orchids and butterflies is extremely therapeutic and a photographers playground. Remember to support the lovely ladies at the Cafe...a bargain for sure @ $2.50 was a small coffee cup filled with 2 scoops of creamy vanilla icecream and yummy home-made caramel topping. There are plenty of bench seats and tables for a peaceful place to read, play a game of backgammon or enjoy the goodies in the picnic basket."
Not to be missed,This place is remarkable. The plants are so vivid and colourful. We were amazed. There were also some interesting birds. It was raining heavily so the butterflies were hiding. We found two.We were disappointed that signs said dogs no allowed. We left ours in the camper. We then saw other people with dogs walking around. Who knows?
Nice walk,Very nice to have a walk or a picnic There are also a few hikes that can be done red - blue - yellow arrow
Gardens visit,Visited this as part of tour very well cared for by volunteers we'll set out easy to get to  the tour guide gave us a talk on the gardens history @ about the various tropical plants very worth while  visiting this attraction   allow about 1hr to see without hurrying   you will enjoy
Great garden & Tank Arts Centre,"The botanic gardens are all they should be, and a wonder to those not from tropical climes - both in terms of specimens, and walking tracks & boardwalk. The bonus is the Talk Arts Centre which doesn't  advertise itself nearly enough, a brilliant reclamation of embarrassing old wartime structures, and when we visited was showing a wondrous exhibition of contemporary indigenous artworks - and obviously does exciting performances too."
Always an adventure and so many beautiful plants to see!,One of the best Botanic Gardens in the world.  What a beautiful hidden treasure!  so many individual areas make up the greater gardens and each have their unique collection of plants.
Relaxing,So many different plants to see. Beautiful varieties. No butterflies in the enclosure which was disappointing.
Cairns Beautiful Botanical Gardens,Beautiful subtropical gardens with lots of lovely orchids and ferns. Definitely worth a visit especially if you have a few days in Cairns.
One of my favourite places in Cairns,We visit the gardens every time we are here. The celebration of tropical plants is a celebration. The gardens are well kept. The orchid house continues to delight. We love these gardens so much we got married there a few years ago. Definitely a favourite of ours.
lovely free day out,"Walked out to the gardens (about an hour from town at a relaxed pace) and then caught the bus home. Wondering around the gardens was very pleasant. lots of information supplied around the walkways. the information centre was closed but the cafe was open. they are however facing restricted space problems so  if you are unable to get a seat there, there is another cafe in the gardens themselves (something the first cafe neglected to tell us at the time which I found more than a little annoying). Really enjoyed our day."
Thoroughly enjoyed the Flecker Botanic Gardens,"A lovely day out. We explored several of the garden areas, but particularly enjoyed the butterfly house where your patience is rewarded by close flying butterflies - a magical experience. The walkways around the gardens vary - some are rougher than others, with steps etc, but there are also large well paved areas easy for everybody. Cafes and souvenir shops available with lovely art and treats to keep you going."
Beautiful little spot,"Beautiful place with heaps of areas to set up a picnic, read or excercise, a really fun kids playground, good trails for amateurs or experienced hikers. A fresh water lake, saltwater lake and a lot of interesting plants and animals to see. I personally recommend seeing the butterfly‚Äôs."
Amazing variety,"Easy to get to with regular bus's, need more than one trip to take it all in. The butterfly's are an experience and the whole place is very well set out and maintained. Much better than expected and well worth the visit. Not just for gardening types."
"Compact botanical garden with beautiful paths, plants, and flowers","Walkable visit allows an opportunity to appreciate the tropical vegetation, flowers, and an immersion in nature, all in a tranquil setting."
nice walk,a peaceful garden to wander through lots of beautiful orchids and interesting plants only found in the tropics
Bus tour,"This was a bus trip with Cairns Discovery Tours and the gardens are absolutely fabulous very beautiful and the amazing trees are  enormous, the orchids many of various species and colourful. This was such a bonus for photography."
Photographers delight ,We spent a couple of hours walking around the gardens. Excellent walks meandering through the plants. Photographers delight! Restaurant seemed busy. Small gift shop with well priced souvenirs.
lovely gardens,"A must see on your visit to Cairns, beautiful gardens and a lovely walk.Always a little cooler in the gardens all tres and plants have signs for identification."
A long way out of town,This is well worth visiting if you like flowers and plants but make sure that you spray yourself with insect repellant if biters like you. The garden itself is well worth the trip but it is not within walking distance and you will need to take a taxi or the hourly bus that starts from the stop in between the Station and the Shopping Centre. You can spend several hours walking around and it is free so you can afford to say fares. Plenty of choice of food and drink is available.
Walk in gardens,"One of our favourite places to visit. Beautifully presented tropical gardens with so many varieties of trees, flowers and plants. The boardwalk is so lovely with different type of vegetation. The salt water and fresh lakes beautiful. A must see is the dome full of ferns, orchids,butterflies and rare plants."
Staff need to learn manners.,Arrived 10 minutes before the gardens were to close. I wanted to grab a couple of photos quickly from inside the gate to show a family member. Staff were super keen to lock the gates. I mentioned they were ten minutes early. Couldn‚Äôt care less. Very disappointing.
Large selection of native plants,Had a great walk around the beautiful gardens. The selection of native plants are amazing. There is a fantastic orchid house were you can sit and listen to the water will looking and the colors of the different varieties. If you are here at the right time of the year there is a huge Jade vine that will amaze you. After the walk we had a big breakfast at the cafe surrounded by trees. One meal does both of us.
Whow This place is spectacular and so worthwhile,"This place is just whow - you need heaps of time to do it justice, days in fact could be spent here.  Went to the Tanks with the art etc inside, amazing use of space.  The plants in the garden were fabulous & a photographer could spend forever here.  There was also a small info centre in the gardens which was informative & well presented.  Saw a lovely looking cafe there too but we did not have time to try it out, definitely need to go back.  There is also FREE tours that happen here with volunteers which are a great asset so for anyone staying in the area or those living there this is a very special place"
Beautiful tropical botanic garden visit,"Lots of interesting plant displays - well set out and labelled. Great to wander, especially as there‚Äôs a lot of shade to enjoy along the paths"
Great little gardens,Disappointing experience at welcome desk. However loved repurposed tanks and history of gardens. Took bus from Cairns and short walk from stop.
Really pleasant walk,This was a great walk to do by myself and so accessible without a car.  I especially enjoyed the rainforest boardwalk.
Beautiful scenery ,I recently moved to Cairns and live right next door to the Botanical Gardens. I always look forward to this walk and observing all the beautiful trees and landscapes it has to offer.
Better in cooler weather,What we saw was very nice. But it was 105 F /40 C so walking too much wasn‚Äôt enjoyable. Wish we could have seen more. Certainly many places to see in the large area it covers
Excellent but take insect repellent,Loved taking a casual stroll around the gardens. There are a lot of exotic plants as well as some beautiful native plants & trees. It has a butterfly & orchid area also a cafe. Just a little tip though because it is quite tropical there were a few insects and mosquitos so insect repellent is a must.
Cairns City and Surrounds Tour,"Our guide Eric explained a lot about the history of the gardens and the features of various plants. They plants were tropical delights, such as orchids, picture plants, timber trees and giant ferns. It was not too hot and plenty of shade. Easy walking for me as I am not young! Seats on the way. Grounds being well cared for by gardeners. I would like to come again."
Day out,We visited here for the day and walked there from Cairns harbour. It was a very nice day out and would definitely return. I took some lovely pictures. We stopped at their cafe for a coffee. We saw some food coming out that looked really good. The rainforest boardwalk was good to walk out back to the main road. Nice day out.
Good walk with Grandkids,When we have visitors we take them to the Botanical Gardens and check to see what‚Äôs new  thats been added to the gardens.There is an enclosed area with birds and butterflies and collection of plants. From the gardens there are 3 kinds of walking tracks to the top of the hill good exercise for all.
Stunning,"Just wow! this rain forest is utterly stunning and so pristine, its a joy to walk through and learn from the helpful cards about the native trees and animals"
Flowers,That place are so clean and the flowers are so beautiful and different unknow what the name are they wow love to walking round
Stopped here on way back from a flight over the great barrier reef,"Fortunately, the company that took us flying proposed to drop us here.  We were not disappointed.  The outdoor ""gardens"" are spectacular.  It's actually more like walking through a tropical rainforest.  Birds, butterflies and a spectacular collection of trees and ornamental plants all in a natural setting, there are well marked paths to wander through at one's own pace.    In addition, the Tank Galleries are just next door.  Easy bus ride from the main road, back into town.  Highly recommend."
Beautiful spot in the city!,We visited the gardens on two occasions.  What a beautiful place with so many places and trails to walk. It‚Äôs like a small tropical city within the city of Cairns. Would highly recommend a visit to stroll around and experience various plants and wildlife or if you are looking for some exercise.
"Wonderfully Garden, you feel being relaxed",Nice preety clean and wonderful garden where butterflies ü¶ã land in your hand if you are genuinely gentle
Lovely!,"Great free thing to do with the family. We spotted two varieties of frogs (watch out for the grassed areas near the lakes as there are hundreds of miniature frogs there and they are easy to squash if you're not careful), heaps of interesting caterpillars, insects and birds. The tropical plants are amazing and it's all well presented. Centenary Lakes play area is on one side of it and this is great for kids. Bring the Aerogard, but other than that this is a great place to visit."
Tropical Gardens and Great Walking Tracks Nearby,Everything is lush and green - great gardens with secluded coffee shop. The adjacent Red Arrow Walking Track is a must do in Cairns with views over the Cairns Airport from the Whitfield Range.
"Smaller than thought, but shady with cafe, easy to reach by bus from central cairns","Easy to get toFlat and shadyEasy for people with walking issuesFreeLovely faunaCafe serves snacks, drinks and meals"
Back to nature,We had a pleasant couple of hours walk looking at all the Tropical and Australian Native plants. So much to see. Then on to the Cafe for a coffee. Worth a trip.
Beautiful in the wet with umbrellas ,One of our hilights during our Cairns stay.Was very lush on a rainy day and all the family enjoyed it. Take an umbrella each.
Another World,"These gardens are fantastic,you can spend hours there and also have a feed.The butterfly and orchid house are fantastic. These gardens are a great place to visit on a hot day.make sure you look up."
Beauty all Around,An afternoon spent wandering around the Tanks Market and then the Cairns Botanical Gardens. It was so relaxing but also breathtaking with the stunning floral displays all around the gardens.
Excellent gardens,"If you‚Äôre staying in Cairns and are interested in the tropical vegetation, then definitely visit the Botanic Gardens. I only had time to do a quick walk through the rainforest boardwalk and Flecker Garden, but was impressed by both. If you have a couple of hours spare it‚Äôs a lovely natural area to walk around and get a feel for the tropical environment."
Beautiful ,"Beautiful gardens just outside of the main area of Cairns.The gardens are set up with lot of different areas including wetlands, rainforest and European and Chinese gardens.Walkways throughout provide easy access and it‚Äôs a beautiful place to visit for either a casual stroll or to get some exercise."
Beautiful and Lush! ,"So peaceful and lush!! Worth a visit for a nice stroll, lots of interesting looking plants and flowers. The butterflies are beautiful!"
Beautiful gardens in Cairns,Just beautiful to have a wonder through whether you are a visitor or local. Best when all in flower but still worth the visit seeing our tropical plant species etc.
A pleasant stroll in tropical nature,Exotic flora and fauna. A chance to see birds that you will not see in the city. Tropical rainforest without travelling far.
AUSTRALIA TOUR,"this was part of our city tour,it is a nice place to spend some time.we had a guide so was really helpful to get all information"
Beautiful gardens and free!,"The Cairns Botanic Gardens are very well maintained, with an interesting array of vegetation and birds.  The gardens are fairly compact, so a visit might take an hour or two.  The enclosed green house includes tropical and unusual plants and butterflies.  There is a coffee shop too.  And it's free to visit, with local bus stop out the front.  Nearby is the Red Arrow Walk and Centenary Lakes - both also worth a visit (and again free!)."
Just beautiful!,"It was a delight to visit this Botanical garden, I think the best of Australia! I spent a whole morning between a vast variety of trees, plants and flowers of the tropical rainforrest. Afterwards, I had lunch in the cafe."
A very nice stroll through the gardens!,"They have quite a wide range of plants and trees from similar climates all over the world. Annabelle was our guide for the 10:00 am to, which was very worthwhile and informative. A beautiful place!"
Cool place under gorgeous shady trees,"Lots of interesting tropical plants, love the orchids most.  Great variety of trees both Australian and from overseas."
Best botanical gardens that we have ever visited.,"Absolutely beautifully layout and an incredible number trees, plants, and flowers. Even if you aren't a plant lover, you will be impressed. I could have spent the whole day wandering."
Fantastic ,"Always loves to visit botanic garden wherever I go. In cairns, there is no exception. It can absolutely make to the top in terms of variety of the spices. The place is extensive and well maintained."
amazing and free,the highlight of my trip. this is free and good for sightseeing and chilling out. I walked from the top to the bottom was dropped off and collected by uber drivers. its a must see.
Great activity for free with a Butterfly House,"A free activity with a beautiful gardens and a special surprise of a Butterfly House, free entry to both."
Well maintained Gardens,"This free attraction can be visited for a good three hours or more.We can see that a lot of effort has been taken to maintain this beautiful Garden.A must see attraction in Cairns.Plants from all over the world are being grown here.Wish I was a botanist to fully appreciate the gardens.There is a restaurant here, if feeling hungry after the walk."
Brilliant,"One of the best gardens we have ever visited. Free entry to these really extensive rain forest based gardens is great.The trees are huge mature specimens, it's like walking through a rain forest. You can spend many hours here. Highly recommended"
Native and exotic beauty! ,"This would have to be one of the most stunning botanical gardens I‚Äôve had the pleasure of spending time in. The variety and colours of the flowers, the well laid out paths that guide you through the journey of tropical rainforest... just sensational. Make sure you have plenty of time and that your phone/camera have plenty of storage!"
Tanks at Botanical Garden,"This was a quick walk from The Lakes Resort, where we stayed. Lovely walk past Bamboo and other plants and trees. It's a paved trail, no worries.  The tanks are repurposed from WWII oil storage. Now they operate as various venues for art and music. One services as a cafe and outdoor space for the Botanical Gardens. Enjoy a coffee, breakfast other meals after you challenge yourself to the adjoining land conservancy, which takes you up, up, and up to the top of the mountain for a look over Cairns."
Relaxing,"Great walk, easy access. Relaxing walk around seeing all the nature. The conservatory  was amazing with the butterflys and beautiful Orchids in bloom."
Most parts open 24/7; gentle strolls to challenging hikes,The free gardens are on a public bus route and only special areas are only open when staff are there.A wide range of gardens to enjoy. This is also the starting point of some bush walks. These range from short and easy to steep and challenging but all are very easy to follow.
Must see if in or going through Cairns!,"If you are a garden lover you must go.  It's free!  Flowers, trees, winding paths. It's small but we spent a lot of time there.  Each path had more to look at.  There are some paths with paths or steps that might be hard if you have stability issues; but there are many paths that are easy, the volunteers there are happy to help you know what to see.  The Rain Forest boardwalk across the street is a must do also."
Best Botanic Garden,"I had one day free, so was looking  for free attractions in Cairns. After consultation with information office expert,   decided to  visit Botanic garden. On 29 October  on  one day bus pass  by  bus 110 to palm cove beach where we spent 2 hrs by walking on shore of fine  sand & surfing water. Then again  by 110 bus we got down at stop where   people  met on way gladly helped us to reach garden. A display with big painted  board of  Cairns Botanic noticed.  Garden is magnificent divided in 3 parts  One Flicker garden which is named after a dedicated plant lover and a scientist doctor who identified many new plant species in Cairns. Broad road runs between parts of  garden where Rainforest boardwalk located on one side and garden information centre, Flecker garden & tanks arts centre on other side .. After roaming in Flecker garden  we enjoyed rainforest boardwalk for 20-30 minutes. One can see variety of plant & flower species with different colours in the Flecker garden. we also saw a section displaying Gondwanan evolution garden which is very much interesting.  Tanks arts centre means big spacious halls constructed in the form of big tanks where in one of tanks we could visit painting display. we climbed up some distance of Mt. Whitfield conservation centre which also worth to visit.   we also visited salt water and freshwater lakes  But in fresh water lake nothing much can be seen. After spending more than 3 hors we took bus 134 to Cairns CBG   truly educational informative and  historical garden."
Beautiful,Very diverse and interesting place! All these tropical plants look amazing. My favorite thing is Rainforest Boardwalk :)
"Lovely gardens, join the free talks and walks ","We visited these botanical gardens several times during our stay in Cairns. Fantastic paradise, with lots to see but the reason we went back and back were the volunteer talks - birds and botanicals! So much to hear about & so different to the rest of the world! Go and enjoy.... the cafes are good too!JW"
Very Pleasant,"Lovely botanical gardens. The link to the art exhibitions was wonderful. I had lunch at the restaurant in the botanical gardens and it was ok but quite expensive for what was on offer. The caf√© at the entrance had lovely juices (I had two on the day, couldn't get enough!). The walks around the gardens were also a must do for anyone that has the time (although there were a lot of stairs!)"
Fabulous Fantastic Fardens,The Botanical Gardens were sensational. The variety of plants and little critters were very friendly. Loved the icolours and symphony of sounds as we walked around the trails. So stunning with some natural history  included.
Crazy jungle so close to CBD,Immerse yourself in the jungle in two steps. Lots of birds and plants. Boardwalk down to the fresh water lakes was great.
Tropical retreat,Don‚Äôt miss to visit when in Cairns. It is so captivating that you feel like staying there forever. I‚Äôll go again next year.
Calm & Quiet,Really nice place to visit and relax. Interesting fruits and plants and also nice to bike or run through! Definitely recommended if you're hanging out in Cairns for a few days.
Beautiful Gardens,"Cairns Botanical Gardens are beautiful, full of lush greenery and wildlife. There are multiple gardens to explore and a few nice, easy-going cafes. In the wet season, make sure you have plenty of mosquitoes repent as there a lot of bugs. There is also an arts centre there that has a gallery, which is worth a look. The suburb of Edge Hill is just up the road, which has a wider variety of cafes and shops."
Fascinating!,"You could easily spend a day her - there is an awful lot to see. It is not just a sample of rain forest but an extensive collection of exotic plants. We only spent a relatively short time there, but a more leisurely stroll would have been nice. Thee is a decent cafe there as well."
the best kept secret in cairns!!,"This place clearly is the best kept secret in cairns!  I come here nearly everyday to do the hiking trails.  There are numerous hiking trails for all levels.  I would encourage everyone to go to the visitor center to get maps of the entire garden and walking trails and cites, along with the separate ,map for hiking.  Everything is free here and there is a small cafe to purchase food and beverages.  I would encourage hikers to start off by doing the red and yellow arrow trails.  When you are ready for the real challenge you have to do the massive and challenging blue arrow trail!  Do not do the challenging green arrow trail because it leaves you in the middle of  a suburban district far away from the main entrance of the garden with no transportation options but walking.  I was so exhaulsted from the very long hiking trail only to have to walk a couple of miles more just to get back to the starting point.  You must wear comfortable shoes, bring plenty of water, insect repellent, and the entire gardens is very safe in all aspects. There are some splendid views from the mountain tops and you need to be able to take photos, as well!"
Free gardens & glasshouse with butterflies,"A wealth of interesting trees & shrubs, glasshouse with orchid displays, shrubs, pond & butterflies, small cafe, free entry, well worth a visit."
Enjoyable for nature-lovers,The plants are amazing here! The variety of different types of trees was really impressive. The conservatory has butterflies and countless varieties of beautiful orchids. The walking paths are easy to follow. There are several different parts/themes. We enjoyed the broad walk on the other side as well. I don't recall it being very hilly but there are areas that require stair access. You could probably get away with not going to those parts and still see a lot.
Much uphill walking,I had a sore foot so wasn't able to enjoy much of the gardens but it seemed like an excellent walk although difficult with a sprained ankle.
"Small, but beautifully formed","Well cared for gardens with lovely plantings. In the middle of the city but felt peaceful and was quiet. Shady areas to avoid heat/sun. Level areas and very few steps. Good parking, cafe nearby, no entrance fee. Well worth visit."
Good bird walk,"There is no question that these are some of the best Botanical Gardens that most people will visit, and it‚Äôs free.We went on a Tuesday morning to the bird walk that happens every week. John, who takes the walk, is very knowledgeable about the gardens but especially the birds. His walk lasts about 2 hours. No need to book, just turn up.Bring the insect repellent as the mosquitoes are vicious üôÅ."
Visit the tropical garden in the heart of Cairns,You will be impressed with the lovely tropical plants in abundance in the Cairns Botanic Gardens in the impressive suburb of  Edge Hill. Easily accessible by public transport
Magnificent plants,"Went here in the morning to enjoy the coolness produced by the plants ,for me the amazing part was that plants we grow as indoor specimens are growing in the wild as in some cases beautiful trees. The conservatory had a terrific array of unusual plants. We finished our exploring with coffee and cake at the cafe which was also delightful. Would recommend a visit here for some cool relaxation."
Bring mosquito repellent,Very enjoyable morning walk. We took our 1 1/2 yo there. Very relaxing and a good way to break the day up. Only downside was the copious amounts of mosquitoes that kept biting us. Repellent is a must
Great experience by Segway,"Went through the gardens as part of a Segway tour, was great to see the gardens this way. Beautiful place, does not compare to anything back home. Recommended."
Very Nice Visit,"Lovely tropical gardens, have a coffee in the cafe to see the bush turkies, rather than sparrows to steal the tit bits from your table"
"Great botanic garden, and free","We had a free morning in Cairns and decided to visit the Botanic Gardens. It was a short taxi ride from our hotel. There was a very helpful visitor information person stationed outside the gift shop that had good suggestions on going through the gardens. As others have commented, the grounds are well maintained and restroom facilities are conveniently located. A wide variety of plants and trees throughout. We would have liked to tour the Tank pavilion featuring repurposed diesel storage tanks from WWII, but it was closed getting ready for another exhibit.Well worth a couple of hours, or more time to see the whole gardens area."
Fantastic,Well signposted and eady access to this beautiful botanic garden. Lots of unusual flowers and the biggest tree I have ever seen. The boardwalk opposite was great with the sounds of many different birds. A delicious lunch at the cafe. Don't miss out on a walk through this great garden. Accessible by bus from the CBD
A lovely park and a reasonable cafe,"This trip we didn't have a lot of time to spend in the gardens but we enjoyed a stroll, a look at the gallery in the amazing pipes, then a coffee. Next time I hope to spend a few hours here."
Exotic gardens,A peaceful place to visit with exototic plants including a spice garden. Very different from boticanical gardens of other cities.
A must do if you like plants!,Great gardens showcasing amazing plants.  Easily spend several hours wandering around and having coffee or lunch!
well worth the visit,"difficult to find a park on market day, but well worth the walk of several blocks....well kept, clean and good to have most plants named"
Must go,Beautiful garden. Free of entry and close to the city. A lot of beautiful butterflies and tropical plants.
FREE experience! Highly recommended!,"The staff of the resort recommended I visit and once I learned it was free, I had to visit. The weather was very pleasant and I really enjoyed the scenery. I really enjoyed the conservatory with the butterflies and orchids. There is a display of plants and their uses according to Aborigines and it is definitely worth looking at. It does not take very long to walk the garden and I would highly recommend stopping by."
"Beautiful, a must see.","Gorgeous well maintained gardens. Plenty to do on the regular, for example Markets, and Starry Night Cinemas!"
Do not miss the garden!,"If you are in Cairns and miss the botanic garden -- then this is your loss.  It is beautiful and we came back three times.  So much to see and learn. Also, make sure you plan some time for the art exhibitions and if you have kids they have a wonderful new playground."
BEAUTIFUL GARDENS,Beautiful gardens to wander through with a couple of lovely cafes that offer a good selection of healthy food and drinks. Also a great staring point if you want to explore the tanks and if you are up to it there are several hiking trails that start next to the gardens.
Stunning Botanical Gardens,We just loved walking around here...absolute delight. So much to look at and had a great meal at the gardens cafe. Do this earlier in the morning before the heat gets up.
Beautiful and Free,"A lovely park, especially the conservatory, with lovely peaceful walks.  Easy parking as well.  I ran thru and we walked thru."
Nice to visit,"I am a local Cairns resident and finally, after a long time, i visited the Cairns Botanical Garden last weekend, with a visiting colleague from Sydney. The enclosed Garden have a lovely flowers display and butterflies, most of them appeared to be the beautiful Birdwing sort. Worth a visit. But beware of biting insects in nearby salt water Centenary Lake, i will write a separate review for that."
"Nature, wildlife & Tropical paradise","I love visiting Cairns Botanic Gardens.. it's peaceful and beautiful. Lots of birds, insects and amazing plants. The butterfly house is nice.. crazy ancient plants and stunning flowers.The rainforest boardwalks are cool too.. just make sure you cover up from the mozzies! Then enjoy a tea or coffee in the cute little cafe surrounded by rainforest"
Beautiful botanical gardens,"Wherever I go I like to visit the local botanical gardens. Cairns does not disappoint. It is well laid out and well tended, focussing on tropical plants, with an excellent conservatory. Don‚Äôt miss this free activity. There are extended connecting walks for those with extra time, and a very interesting gallery and arts centre made out of old water tanks. We really enjoyed this activity."
Gorgeous,"You feel like your in a rain forest as you drive through with beautiful boardwalks and paths either side of the road,huge palms and so much lush greenery then you arrive a t a small village called Edgehill.Once inside the gardens it‚Äôs so peaceful and serene with many hundreds of trees plants and well mainted paths to meander,we didn‚Äôt visited the cafes.Would definitely recommend a visit here."
"Amazing, a must see!",What a fantastically well maintained collection of exotic tropical plants. It is free. The conservatory has a beautiful orchid collection. A  photographers paradise. It's very close to the airport so very convenient if you have 2-3 hours before you need to check in. I walked the 50 minutes from the marina so I could explore other parts of the city. If you need to save time it's about 10 minutes by car from the Marina area and there is plentiful street parking around the gardens. A great place to go when it's really hot. If you are into  plants or nature then allow 6 hours or  so for a decent tour of the Flecker Garden and all associated  areas between Collins Avenue and  Greenslopes street. If you want to hike you can take the tracks up to Mount Whitfield. The Tank Arts centre is right next door for those not so interested plants. Highly recommended.
Tropical Gardens,"Unlike most other botanic gardens, this one is informal and tropical. There's lots to see, so plan to stay for at least a couple of hours. Walking tracks provide additional routes for those keen on a challenge. Check out the Watkins Munro Martin Conservatory to see cycads and local butterflies. This is a relaxing day out, but bring the insect repellent, as the mosquitoes are hungry."
Botanical Gardens,"Absolutely fantastic, the gardens are a mass of colour with so many different species that Ive never seen before, some of the palm leaves are lager than my sister or myself. Everything is gigantic, eventhe carnivorous plants!!!!  All I can say is, just go and see for your self. Oh there are two great cafes there also."
Surprisingly a great garden right in the city,I love that the Botanic garden is right in the city. It is huge so I do understand that not all parts can be cleaned up at one time. Lots of plant species from tropical countries around the world which makes it more interesting.Give yourself at least 3 to 4 hours to walk around.
Lush greenery,We were there for the Cairns Jazz Festival and took a picnic.  There's a bus outside to take you to Central.  Well worth the visit.
Nice and relaxing escape,"If you like something to do on your lazy Sunday, you definitely have to come to this botanic garden! They have plenty of little unpaved walk way that was fun to venture around!"
Hidden Gem,I had not originally intended to head here.  It's a good mix of parks and pseudo rainforest.  Both the lakes are interesting as well.
Stunning Gardens,"Wow. What a place, easy enough to get around, loads of plants that look very, very healthy. Walkways and paths walkable. Parking not an issue. Cafe fine. Could be more seating throughout the gardens so people can chillax on seats. I loved it. Been back already. So many plants  I'd not seen before."
Loved it! ,"Went here on bikes as quite a walk from the centre but absolutely loved the gardens, excited to go back and do the lakes"
Lovely gardens to visit,"We found the gardens in beautiful condition and to see mixture of local and overseas plants living in harmony was great.   The design of the gardens is well thought out and the whole area was very clean and tidy.  Lot of bird life also.  On down side, found the cafe expensive.  Overall well worth the visit and free to go in."
"Very spacious, lots to see and free","The Cairns Botanic Gardens are very big and it would take a few days to see everything and doesn‚Äôt cost anything. We visited twice and were very impressed. We did a guided tour lasting about 1  hour which is conducted by the friends of CBG, and it was very informative and also free. The tours start at 10am. The gardens are very well laid out and have information placards in many places."
Beautiful gardens with some special features,Well worth a visit. Schedule one to have a tour with the volunteer guide. Netted butterfly and other tropical exotic plants enclosure is interesting.
Good place to wind down,"Located within cycling distance of the city, this has many areas/parts with a rich array of tropical trees.  Cafe within to have a bite and relaxing areas located conveniently, makes this a place to visit, different from the tiring tours out of Cairns"
Something special for treelovers!,Great way to experience local flora for free. Rainforest part when you walk in it - was the best! Don't miss the smaller part of the park - it is really beautiful too!
Gardens gardens everywhere ,What a great Botanical Gardens!When visiting Cairns a definitely must see. There are often markets/festivals/night movies through the dry season.Free Tours! - sadly the bird tour & garden tour don‚Äôt don‚Äôt finish when the other starts. Megapodes digging everywhere are great to see.Gingers everywhere.Indigenous food plants areaIt‚Äôs a credit to the staff at how well the gardens are kept.Three parts - the gardens                     - the Melaleuca wetlands                      - Fresh & Saltwater lakes
Fascinating gardens. ,Our family thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the gardens. The walkways were easy access for the baby pram and the number markings on the various trees and palms useful when looking for information on the park map. Beautifully kept gardens.
Great Bike Ride,We had a great time riding around and having a look. It is a lovely gardens and the cafe was great too. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have a nice relaxing day looking around.
Beautiful!,A visit to the Cairns Botanical Gardens is well worthwhile. The tropical garden is beautiful & well maintained. Enjoyed the butterfly sanctuary & orchids too. We had lunch at the the cafe & the gluten free carrot cake & waffles were delicious üòã Highly recommend for a relaxing well shaded morning or afternoon.
Stunning gardens,One of the best botanical gardens in AustraliaBeautiful and colourful flowers including orchids and carnivorous plants
Exotic plants,"Lovely visitor centre, extremely helpful staff, and coffee shop. Exotic plants and trees to wander through and a glasshouse with plants and butterflies (very pretty). On the opposite side of the road are lakes. Free admission to both."
Beautiful Gardens,"Our visit was on the 4th August 2019. We spent many hours admiring the beautiful plants and exotic flowers. Very easy to walk around and a credit to the ground staff for the way it is presented.Saw Brush Turkeys building their nest, and orange -footed Fowls"
Paradise in the suburbs,"Although I have been to the gardens a few times when I visit, it never disappoints and there is always something new to see.  August is a good time to visit with flowers everywhere.  A number of strange plants that makes for a very interesting few hours looking around."
A must visit for birdwatchers and plant lovers ,What a great place! Exotic plants and exotic birds. Best is to start at the Centenary lakes and walk to the botanical garden on the boardwalk. We went there twice and enjoyed it each time. The only part that closes (at 5:30 pm) is the Fletcher garden. But the whole place is interesting.
great,great to walk around and very interesting.The trails are fairly easy to manage and the coffee shop is really good.Great breakfasts served there
Very pleasant and interesting.,A lovely park which highlights lots of different plants. Well established and relaxing. Ideal fr weddings. Loved the lakes. Flat for old people.
Splendid Plant Collection plus more,"I always visit Botanic Gardens in places I visit.The  Cairns Gardens collection is a MUST SEE .Spice gardens, Aboriginal Plant use, Rainforest Gully, enormous rainforest trees, colourful collections of beautiful plants in the conservatory & a great cafe/visitor centre. Over the road is centenery lakes, pristine rainforest with boardwalks and separate freshwater & saltwater lakes. Need a FULL day to appreciate everything, and then some more time."
Nice FREE way to spend a few hours,"loved it was free!  Amazing variety of plants, trees and vegetation.  Very relaxing after fun filled days of playing int he water"
Lovely,The gardens are well worth a visit. They are large and well set out. There is a nice cafe near the entrance too.
We always like to stroll through Botanical Gardens.,"Obviously tropical based, these Cairns Botanical gardens are a treat. Beautifully coloured plants and exhibits.  Loved the Butterfly enclosure and the landscaping. Also enjoyed the boadwalks too, & the coffee at the end of our visit."
Just beautiful,The botanical gardens are beautiful. They are so big so allow plenty of time. So many birds and butterflies. Loved the gift shop to.
"Relaxing, beautiful and free!",Stopped by the Botanic gardens and just did a short walk thru. Fun to see plants and just slow down.
Just ok,"This botanic garden was free to enter, had a few nice plants and a good greenhouse but that was about it. There were workmen making noise and dust in one area so we couldn‚Äôt go there and some really rude people in the greenhouse meant that we didn‚Äôt enjoy our time at the gardens as much as we hoped. Parking is also an issue as the gardens doesnt have dedicated parking and instead it is on steet parking near to the entrance."
Cool free activity,"I enjoyed the Botanic Gardens in Sydney more, but this was still a cool spot. Much more greenery than flowers - free and only about a 10 minute drive from downtown Cairns"
Lovely way to wipe away the day,Beautiful and well annotated botanic gardens. Superb collection of tropical plants and all very nature. The self guided tour is excellent-get it from the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù house. Beware the cafe is expensive for a simple lunchAlso make sure you have bug spray on before you venture onto the Boardwalk.
A stunning lovely place to visit,"We always visit Cairns botanic garden when we are here. It is a peaceful place with the orchid house conservatory a standout place to visit. The butterflys are relly exotic and you good close to them. One of the coolest places in Cairns. Free to visit Take a picnic and enjoy,"
Delightful Carns Biotanic Gardens,"We walked 3 km (2 mi) from the Hilton down Esplanade and another km over to the gardens. It was all worth it. There were many areas where you felt like you were in the middle of a rain forest. Many trees and bushes were blooming (mid-August). We had walked around the Sydney Botanical Gardens (don‚Äôt waste your time) the previous week and the difference was huge. If you travel to Cairns, don‚Äôt miss this treat."
Beautiful place,We visited for about a hour. It‚Äôs a lovely place and the highlight was the butterflies in the conservatory
"Beautiful, peaceful, relaxing place","I had 4 hours to amuse myself before returning the hire car and jumping on a plane and the Botanic Gardens proved to be the perfect place to relax and enjoy the wonders of nature during that time, plus grab a cold drink and use the amenities.  I especially loved the conservatory but the whole place is lovely."
Must see for garden lovers,"This is a well established and maintained tropical gardens. There is an extensive range of palm trees that are impressive. The gardens are organised in sections to demonstrate a variety of tropical plants and environments. Tour the Gondwana garden to understand the evolution of early plant types. The enclosure houses wonderful orchids, bromeliads and butterflies. Walk through the rainforest to the lakes and saltwater environment. So much colour and variety."
Beautiful Gardens,"We had a very pleasant and relaxing wander through the gardens, and really enjoyed seeing lots of different tropical plants & trees that we don‚Äôt see at home."
"Beautiful, relaxing, and free","Had a lovely afternoon wandering around the Cairns Botanic Gardens before my flight.  It's well layed out, easy to navigate, and there are a massive range of stunning tropical plants. Free entry but there is a cafe/toilets if you need them."
Fantastic,"If you are in Cairns, visiting the botanic garden is an absolute must. Incredible flora and fauna.A little rainforest with nice walks."
What a terrific place to spend a few hours while in Cairns,We loved this place not only for botanical abundance but that the access was clearly defined for of us that cannot handle lots of steps.  The barramundai lunch was the best we have had anywhere!  A must place to visit!
Free! Really?,Go anywhere else in the world and gardens as good as this would charge entry. We had a good 2hrs walking around beforw gorgeous juices and cake at the cafe. Remember to wear insect repellent or you will get bitten!
A good substitute for the Daintree,"A real gem, many different micro gardens within. The gardens are on both sides of the road and extend to Centenary Lakes. It‚Äôs all worth looking at. We felt this offered more in some ways than the Daintree, which required a lot of driving and didn‚Äôt provide much in the way of walking, just shortish boardwalks."
So much to do and see!,We had a great time visiting the many gardens on display in the Cairns Botanic Gardens. A fun and cheap day out that anyone can enjoy.
So much to see and do,We went here twice during our recent 5 day stay and didn't see all of the aspects. The arrow walks make it a fitness and walking/hiking destination. The great coffee shop is a good place to stop and there are plenty of other features that we will need to visit in the future.
Free to roam among the world class fauna and flora,"My wife and I were rather jaded and tired from too much earlier activity when we entered the Botanical Gardens. A bit numb and unmotivated. But before very long at all, we were reinvigorated, in tune with nature and ourselves, had our eyes and all senses informed and delighted and satisfied. We appreciated in particular the freedom to roam at our own pace, to longer or move on. A very pleasant welcome cafe in the centre is to be recommended and praised. As was the highlight: the glasshouse with its butterflies, aromas, orchids and lavish vegetation and exotic trees and other flowers. Be deeply refreshed right here!!"
Very pleasant,"Right by the airport, so the gardens have become a regular spot for us to kill an hour or two between hotel and plane. Easy short strolls around the interesting formal gardens, or something a bit longer and more challenging ('many steps' means what it says in the walk guide!) In the rainforest.  There is an old fashioned tea rooms in the formal garden, a modern cafe not far away."
All Bigged Up,"In July,very little colours but lots of huge tall trees and ferns,which is lovely coming from a drier part of the country.Even the leaves are gigantic.I learnt something about orchids,looking at them in the greenhouse.I didnt know they grew like that with the roots so long.If you have little time,do the Flecker garden and the rainforest boardwalk,can do in an hour if walk fast"
Casual day,"A well spent visit. So many beautiful plants. You will have green-envy! Be sure to visit the cafe, gift shop and Tank Gallery."
Botanic Gardens were great,This is definitely worth a half day of your time.  The price was also one of the best deals in Australia (free).
Beautiful gardens ,It was lovely walking through the gardens & exploring such beauty. Love all the tropical plants. Beautiful butterflies in and around the gardens. Plenty of parking & free entry. There are lovely picnic areas or you can order something at the very quaint Tea Garden.  A very enjoyable morning.
Amazing Gardens,"The variety of palms and plants along with the colours of the foliage was spectacular. Then came the flowers, breathtaking orchids, heliconias and others, wow! We are from way down south and just can't grow these plants in our hyper dry climate."
Worth a visit,"Easy way to wile away the time. Beautiful gardens full of tropical plants & trees, nice rainforest trails etc.  Certainly worth a visit."
Worthwhile,"Dragged my friend along here on a recent trip to cairns and after her complaining all morning it turned out to be her most enjoyable day while visiting. The gardens are beautiful and easy to walk around. Went into the butterfly house and was given some great information about the variety of plants and butterflies, he even helped me with my questions about which plants are best for bees, he explained to me about how they cant get nectar from orchids which I found quite surprising! Would be a lovely day out for anyone, bring a picnic and make a lovely day out of it."
Bautiful,"Lovely grounds, great for a walk, picnic, lunch at the cafe, walk through the butterfly home. Went there went the tanks markets were on and there were a lot of stall holders, this is a must if you market stalls."
"Easy to walk around  ,lovely orchids,","Easy to walk around, orchids beautiful colours, butterflies around everywhere. Cafe we had cake and coffee at was lovely food.pleasant morning out."
Recent visit,"We haven‚Äôt been to the gardens for a while, however, the improvements were very noticeable. The Orchid house has been revamped for an excellent visit."
relaxing time,"spent  a lovely afternoon just wondering around the gardens ,looking at the different areas  it was so relaxing and a way to  fill in an afternoon"
Tropical gardens in Cairns city.,The Cairns Botanic gardens are 10 minutes for cairns international airport and a world away from the modern city life. From plants that predate the dinosaurs to hothouse orchids the Cairns Botanic gardens showcases everything green the wet tropics has to offer and you can walk or ride from your City accommodation.
Loved the rainforest walk,"We spent a Sunday morning at the Botanic Gardens walking through to the TANKs at the top. There are a number of different elements to the Gardens, a rainforest walk, an aboriginal plant section and the Flecker Gardens to name but a few. Oh, and, importantly, a coffee shop! Open every day and free entry."
plant lovers,so many wonderful tropical plants to see awesome good way to spend a day to relax enjoy and take in the beauty of tropical plants
Well set out gardens,I did the gardens by Segway. They are really big do you need s Nike or segway to view it  properly.nthechardens are beautiful especially the enclosed one with. Orchids and tropical plants
Lovely gardens and trails in Mount Whitfield,"Highly recommend, beautiful gardens, and very good trails to hike on Mount Whitefield if you would like to be active for a bit. Lovely restaurants at the gardens."
Well worth a visit,We by accident parked b the children‚Äôs play area which has just been revamped.  What a lovely way to enter the gardens.  Amasing play area wish I was a child again or had children with us.  Loved the walk along the boardwalks towards the visitor centre. Butterflies ü¶ã tall trees and ferns.  Really enjoyed walking under the canopy of the trees.  Big lake area with ducks and pelicans.  Very relaxing.
Lovely botanic gardens in city surrounds.,We love the Cairns Botanic Gardens. The Flecker Gardens are beautifully maintained with the orchid house being a highlight. The volunteer guide in there was friendly and informative as he talked about the captive butterflies. The new boardwalk through to the Centenary lakes section makes the area very accessible being wheelchair and stroller friendly.
Great location and very interesting walk,We visited just as we were driving past and were glad that we stopped there is a lot to see and it was a great walk. So great experience all the different plants and flowers. Lots of people walking and exercising and riding their bikes.
Nice but exhausting,I walked nearly the whole trail in the garden which is nice but a little bit ohysically demanding. There even were small wallabies jumping around.
Wonderful walk through nature,We decided to take a visit to the gardens and were really impressed by the lay out and facilities. There are multiple trails that are a joy to walk and a very good cafe for a good coffee or light meal and a glass of wine.
Quite compact but very informative,"Loved the Cairns botanical gardens.  We saw the Tank art exhibit as we entered which was quite interesting but unstaffed it seems, so we weren‚Äôt sure who to talk to. The gardens were beautiful - a fair bit to see and read, making it quite an informative place. They did seem to be small though - considering the variety of tropical flora and fauna, as well as, what we can learn from the native aborigines - there is plenty more that can be added to the place."
Easy walk to look at rainforest ,Close by and free look at a rainforest. It has eating and toilet facilities. Staff are friendly and informative. They let you know if various walks to suit you time and ability
Lovely Gardens and settings,Such a beautiful Botanic Gardens with temperatures a few degrees cooler than out in the sunshine. The gardens are restorative and a wonderful place to spend a few hours.
Do the free tour with a guide ,We learned a lot here from our volunteer guide who pointed out many things about the plants and the garden. It‚Äôs on the spectacular side and easy to reach from town. Find the jade vine and go inside the conservatory.
Free activity for all ages,Wonderful day exploring the gardens. So much to see here. Easy access to all pathways. Great food cafes.
A wonderful way to start our day.,We began each day by walking around the various walks available. The boardwalk takes you through a lovely rainforrest walk.
Brilliant ,It was a boiling day but when I went there I felt so relaxed because of the plants. You can find lots of kinds of tropical plants and it‚Äôll definitely make you satisfied!
Walking in the Forest,Walked around the Rainforest boardwalk and then back via the Bamboo forest - highly recommended. There is plenty of parking
Lush & lovely ,"If you come from the southern states of Australia, you will find this botanical garden very different to what you have in your own state, it's so much greener, lusher, and colourful. So yes, visit this place ! The conservatory is just beautiful !"
Beautiful,Went on a half day tour and visited the Botanic Gardens lovely tranquil place would recommend a visit you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
Lovely gardens for a stroll,"We went for a morning walk in the gardens, and it was luscious and peaceful. The butterfly enclosure had a few, but predominantly resting so we really had to search for them. The orchids were gorgeous (very small in scale if anyone has been to the Orchid Gardens in Singapore). We had a break in the onsite cafe, had a great liver detox juice there. The south side of the gardens were completely closed and under construction, so it was a shame we were unable to see the full park. To explore the full gardens, you would need half the day. Bring a compact umbrella for unexpected weather."
Splendid Gardens,I always love plants. Botanic Gardens in cairns has to be one of my favourites. Lots of plants from all over the world. It has lots of varieties and in splendid colours. Absolutely stunning.
Stunning gardens,I wish we had allowed more time here as it is so tranquil and beautiful. I could spend a whole day here with a coffee stop in the cafe.
Stunning and Free,"The Gondwana garden was one of the best I've eve seen at a Botanic Gardens - unique to take you through time that way.  We enjoyed killing 1.5 hours here and walking around and that was only seeing half the space (the other side of the street we didn't get to).  It wasn't crowded in June when we visited.  The gift shop I felt was the only let down. I love gift shops at botanic gardens and there was so little for sale here I was kind of disappointed I couldn't even buy a postcard that said ""Cairns Botanic Gardens"" on it."
Have to visit!,Each time we are in Cairns we visit the Botanic Gardens. An asset to the city and we love it very much!
Bike ride to the Botanic gardens,We rode our bikes to the Cairns Botanic gardens from the Esplanade and really enjoyed the lovely gardens and scenery at the botanic gardens.  Worth the ride.   We were there when it was a bit overcast and too early for the butterflies to be around in the atrium
Little Oasis in the heart of Cairns.,Worth a visit if you are in Cairns. The gardens are easy to navigate your way around and has a diverse range of plants and historical interests. Walk around to the Tanks Arts precinct next door while you are there and see this fantastic conversion of old oil tanks.
Peaceful & Beautiful,"Cairn Botanic Gardens are simply stunning. It is a great place to meander and take in the scenery. When visiting I was in awe of the variety of plants and their wild colours! The conservatory was lovely as there were butterflies everywhere, there‚Äôs something so magical about them! Definitely worth adding to the itinerary when in Cairns!!"
Relaxing ,Very casual place to walk around and enjoy the flaura and fauna. So relaxing and peaceful. Beautiful plants with the butterfly display.
simply the best place to visit in Cairns,"Every time we visit Cairns, the Botanical Gardens are a must , never get sick of walking around the lush gardens."
Great fernery,A wonderful couple of hours wandering through the Botanical Gardens is topped of by a visit to the fernery.
Beautiful,Spent the day wandering around the beautiful Botanic Gardens. The flowers are just stunning! A must see if travelling through.
Lovely place to wander,We enjoyed the butterfly conservatory and wandering through the gardens.  It's worth a walk over the the lakes too - great playground for kids there.Highly recommend the high tea at the cafe in the gardens (near the conservatory).  The scones were delicious and the staff are lovely.
Beautiful Gardens,Spent a couple of hours walking the gardens-very enjoyable. Make sure you grab a map to guide you. Lunch at the cafe also enjoyable.
Beautiful Gardens,"A huge range of tropical plants and of course no greenhouses as they don't need them.  This is a great place to go for a stroll and enjoy the experience.They have recycled a number of storage tanks from the Second World War and they are used for displays, rehearsals and various cultural events.  This is a wonderful idea.There is a restaurant in the grounds of the Gardens although they close at about 2 pm.  Your visit to the Gardens is free !"
Beautiful gardens,"A variety of plants set out with great winding walkways. Whilst a little hard to navigate, just spending a while walking round is very enjoyable.The butterfly house is really good with lots of interesting plants in and being able to identify butterflies from the signs was a fun activity. Sad that quite a large section was closed when we visited and this wasn't listed on the website.Easy to get to by bus from the centre of the city."
"very impressive, lots of Butterflies","very impressive, lots of Butterflies! Staff comes out sometimes to bring little new born Butterflies. It¬¥s free, you should go there!"
Meet the locals,"Before you start exploring the Daintree and the Reef, acclimatize at the Cairns Botanic Gardens. The gardens are interconnected with walking paths that lead right into the centre of Cairns, through a cultural precinct entirely created from upcycled water tanks, and into the Mt Whitfield Conservation Park. Mt Whitfield has walking trails for most levels of fitness with rewarding views over Cairns and its surrounds at the summit of each. A great way to introduce yourself to FNQ & get an overview of your location FOR FREE!"
Wonderful morning walk,This is a fantastic botanical garden. We came from Cairns city on the 130 bus and walked across through the rainforest to get to the visitors center. The gardens are a joy and you will need about 3 hours to get the most from the trip. You could spend all day as there is a good cafe. The best return bus is the 131 which is directly outside the gardens. Highly recommend.
Green Bathing,"This is one of the best botanic gardens in Australia (maybe the world). Great tropical species, beautifully cared for, right in town, lots of information."
Amazing plant life. Magical setting,We walked from downtown out to the gardens. It was a long walk. But were greeted by some truly spectacular plant life. Just amazing. Do get a map when you arrive from the shop (free at the desk). You will want to make sure you don‚Äôt miss anything.
"Nature, on the town's doorstep","One visit to the butterfly & orchid enclosure. Delighted to spend a time here, amongst the lillies, orchids, pitcher plants and of course the butterflies. relaxing and serene. One visit for a run up the ""red trail"" with views down on Cairns and glimpses of paleo plants, tropical plants and bush birds. Passed a number of runners using the trail to get a puff up. Was a great place to go, to get out of the town centre."
Stunning!!!,The gardens are truly beautiful with some many different species was well worth our visit. A must see.
Peaceful ,We went here straight from the airport. It was a great spot to unwind from the hassles of traveling and settle into holiday mode in a very peaceful place. We had been there 4 years before.
Cairns Botanical Garden Magic,"We had an hour to kill while waiting for our flight out of Cairns and visited the Botanical Gardens right next to Cairns Airport (very convenient location). We spent most of that hour in the greenhouse observing tropical delights and many incredible Northern Queensland butterflies!!! Well worth a visit, the orchids and unusual selection of tropical flowering plants didn‚Äôt disappoint."
Beautiful flowers,"We love this tropical garden. Many different flowers, especially  the orchids, tall teak trees and beautiful butterflies.  You can find a peaceful place in this city and enjoy the lovely flowers and plants.  Highly recommended."
Beautiful Tropical Experience,"The gardens are beautiful. Lovely tropical vegetation with exotic flowers and beautiful butterflies. Lovely spot to walk around, relax and enjoy the plants. There is a wide range of trees, palms and vegetation to explore. The trees are quite magnificent with their extensive spread of branches. They are a whole environment with goodness knows what living up in the canopy. Lots of exotic birds also."
Beautiful place,A beautiful place. Well worth the Red Arrow walk up Mount Whitfield as there is a fantastic view from the top..
Great way to experience the rain forest in the city,A very pleasant way to spend a morning or afternoon stroll. It is well signposted with toilets and BBQ spots so great for a picnic.
Neat place to walk around,"Our family of 4 (2 teenage daughters) went to the botanical gardens when we had a couple of hours in the morning before our flight out. It was a little tricky getting here, as we originally got on the wrong bus, but the bus driver called ahead to the correct bus and took us to a bus stop to transfer.  Make sure to take the SunBus and it will take you to the entrance. The bus ride was only $ 2-3 AUD from our hotel. The botanical gardens are free. There is an information center where you can get a map. You can spend several hours here, but we could only spend an hour, which was OK because our feet were tired from several days of walking. We tried to take the bus back, but it never came to the bus stop (construction going on), so the information/gift shop lady called a taxi for us and it was just a couple of more dollars for the 4 of us than the bus. I would recommend coming here if you have time."
Lovely day out,"Such beautiful scenery, so much to look at. Enjoyed walking around and taking photos of all of the different plants!"
Go on the Talk/ Walk  - Free,"We got Bill as our Tour Guide.  A walk that was advertised as 60-90 mins took 2 hours as Bill knows just about every tree. A man very passionate about  the Gardens, and full of knowledge. A must do"
A great day outing,"If you like to walk, take yourself down to the water and keep walking and walking and eventually you¬¥ll hit Cairns Botantical gardens, which in addition to having a vast array of bamboo trees, ferns, and other foliage, has a place to view many gorgeous butterflies. It is also right by the Tanks, where an interesting exhibit of local art was going on when I visited. A great place to spend a day in Cairns."
Stunning gardens,"The Botanic Gardens are well laid out and delightful to stroll through.  Cafe is a wonderful bonus.  The staff was incredibly helpful when I stopped by to ask for a map of the hiking trails (Red, Yellow, Blue and Green Arrow Tracks) above the gardens.  I was given the map and detailed suggestions of the best routes.  Well worth a stop."
Great chance to get out for a quick walk ,Lovely spot even in the rain. Was nice to get out and have s wander through the gardens- lots in flower. Easy to get around.
Just beautiful.,"This is a wonderful tropical garden, close to the Cairns airport. It is well set out, beautifully maintained and very restful. The butterfly enclosure was very special. A must do place whilst in Cairns."
"Great place to spend the day, highlighting the superb plants of the region.",The conservatory is stunning and the plants are splendid. The orchids in flower and butterflies in their hundreds. Excellent job.
1st class gardens,Full of unique and fascinating plants. Lots of flowers that are not seen down south. Well worth a visit by anyone.
"The sort of plants and trees that I have never seen, Fantastic",The quantity and quality of these gardens are truly amazing. If you are not from the tropics you will see things growing that you never knew existed. Truly spectacular and all free.
Delightful & free!,I took the bus to the Botanical Gardens & an Uber back as I missed the bus which only ran once per hour. I can't believe these fantastic gardens are free! They weren't crowded and were fascinating with various trails up & down small hills. I went by myself. Everyone I met was very friendly!
Good food in the Botanic Gardens,"Had breakfast there upon arrival in Cairns. Food was tasty, with generous servings. Service was very good, staff were friendly and accommodating. Capped the meal with a leisurely stroll in the gardens. So many interesting and beautiful plants."
A beautiful Experience,"Plenty to see and a trek up a little big hill next to it if you're up for the challenge. Red, Blue or Green trail!! choose wisely"
Beautiful and well thought out,This is not really what I expected to find in Cairns but have to say that someone had a fab idea in thinking this place up. It's a definite must do/see. Lots to see and enjoy.
Gardens galore on steroids ,"This place is stunning! In fact, my daughter likened it to what the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may look like if they still existed. We visited on a gorgeous day with bright blues skies and sunshine. The flowers on the trees are colorful and exotic. There were tons of butterflies in the conservatory. It‚Äôs a simply beautiful place and all for free! How can one beat that?"
Gardens and Butterflies,"It was our last day and we wanted to do something that didn't restrict us on time or money.  There was no entry fee, so you can't beat that price.  It's beautifully maintained with an enclosed area that hosted a number of butterflies.  Got some great pics from that.  We used Uber to get there but there are a number of bus stops right in front of the Visitors Center."
Hike before flight,"Quite close to the airport, a great place to get in a bit of exercise before a long flight.  A number of routes to choose from depending on time available, beautiful trails and terrain with amazing views."
Cairns Botanical Gardens,"The bus tour of Cairns allowed us a 20 minute time in the gardens , so we only saw highlights with a volunteer guide. Well set out and very worthy of a longer visit."
"Beautiful, fascinating and relaxing",The is nothing like sitting down with a hot cup of tea surrounded by Lucy tropical and exotic plants...
A day in their garden,Was impressed with the presentation of all the sections of the Gardens. We entered from the street on the side so a few more flyers for visitors would be great. We wondered around until we fell on the visitors centre. Visited the visitors centre and the girl was helpful .
Gardens visit,Wow what a place to visit amazingly beautiful our guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly higly recommend
So lush and beautiful!,"Compared with Brisbane's botanic gardens, the Cairns botanic gardens are soo much better. It was really interesting to see all the different varieties of plants that grow up in the tropics compared with down in Brisbane."
Tropical garden,"A lush garden of green with little pops of colour. A range ofvunusal leaves with variegated colours on them. The gingers were lovely with unusual and interesting flowers. A small garden over all, easy to fit a visit into day. Allow up ty o 2 hours. Easy bus access from Cairns, aboutc12 minutes. Free entry. Cool in shade of lush foliage."
Definitely worth a visit,Amazing different areas in the botanic gardens. We saw some wild mud skippers and there is a free greenhouse filled with butterflies and indoor plants.
Not much to offer,"I was disappointed by the gardens, specifically made the trip to see the Chinese Friendship garden but there's not much to it. The visitor centre closes early so make sure you check the times and lots of paths had half hearted attempts at signage to say they were closed... not sure why. Plenty of better things to spend your time at in Cairns."
This is a must with kids! Loved the Butterfly Garden too!,"I was sceptical taking my two kids (5 years & 3 years old) - but we all loved this place! The kids had the best time, running through the rainforest under the trees through the bridges along the streams, it was such a nice morning!There is a free Butterfly Avery, full of lovely orchids & butterflies are everywhere :)The gardens also connect through to the Tanks art precinct, and also across the road & river to a great kids playground.We spent all morning and had lunch on the way back at the cafe. I would highly recommend to anyone with kids, it is such a nice place where the kids can run free & not disturb anyone. The plans and design was super nice too!"
I love this place,"serene, beautiful and free. a must if you're visiting Cairns - there's a cute cafe/restaurant on the grounds too"
Better than ever: And free!,We last visited over fifteen years ago and were surprised and pleased to see how it had grown in both size and diversity. The garden had a wonderful collection of well signed plants and trees. The conservatory housed a great collection of orchids and pitcher plants and a scattering of butterflies.The  Gondwana forest hours a great collection of primitive plants and trees including a variety of magnificent Kauris.
Awesome place,"A simply great place , the plants are so tall and lush .Inside the water feature and plants were surrounded by gorgeous butterflies .Dont forget to pay a visit to pay a visit to the tearoom We can highly recommend the sticky date pudding and the cream teas !"
Beautiful place!,Amazing place to take a walk and relax... perfect for a weekend picnic with family and friends... highly recommended!
Beautifully presented and maintained,"Loved our visit to the Botanic Gardens. There was a massive variety of plants, easily accessed and well maintained. The Ulysses butterfly was superb in its natural habitat."
Magical place for getting positive energy and connecting to Mother Earth,"Wow our Botanical Gardens is just divine and perfect for connecting to your roots and getting into the realms of nature. I always feel charged with positive energy after visiting the botanical gardens in Edge Hill, Cairns. Great food at the cafe too."
Amazing wildlife ,Came here with my little girl she loved the gardens . A lot of bats at dusk but that‚Äôs just cairns . Amazing animals just watch out for the poop .
Nice gardens and walk,"Been here in the morning for a nice walk. Made the short Red Cross walk up to the Mt. Whitfield second lookout, that was nice and not so difficult to reach - just 50 minutes return (didn't have time). Many people go for jogging in the park. The Flecker garden with the Conservatory deserves a visit even if I just found 4 butterflies there. The plants are gorgeous anyway. Unfortunately the Rain Forest walk was closed so I couldn't be there. The centenary lakes were peaceful and I reached them following the road instead of the paths inside the park."
Breakfast in a tropical rain forest.,Coming from inland Australia enjoyed sitting in a rain forest experience for breakfast. The cafe was well set out and the food was very good at a reasonable price. The service by the staff was very friendly. After breakfast walking through the gardens was a lovely way to start the morning. Highly recommend.
Plants indigenous to the region,A well designed botanic garden using regional indigenous plants. We were shown around by an enthusiastic volunteer guide in a group of 10. Plenty of wheelchair friendly access. They are missing a trick by not having better refreshment facilities.
lovely gardens,Beautiful place for a couple of hours' stroll through huge trees and shady walks. Free too! And a good cafe. On local bus route 130 / 131.
Beautiful botanicals,Lovely way to chill after a morning of touring the rainforest. The butterflies inside the arboretum were impressive. So were the many equatorial plants and flowers which were new to us. The cafe in the Gardens was also a pleasant quiet lunch spot.
Fun and informative,"We had a great time joining volunteer guide Dave on his free guided walk of the gardens! We learnt so much and saw lots of beautiful greenery from around the world. Even though it was extremely informative, it was kept so fun with Dave's personality and ability to relate trees and plants to real life situations so that you gain a better understanding and appreciation of it all!"
Tranquil gardens ,Love wandering around the gardens. So much to see. The atrium with the orchids and the butterflies is best. Theres also a cafe which has good food and coffee
Awesome walk,"Just awesome, lakes with lots of birdlife.Easy walk, stroller and wheelchair friendly. Fantastic interactive playground for the children. The friendship garden was lovely."
Pretty,Lovely free place to walk around in. Interesting plants and you may spot some lizards and snakes there too
Lovely Tropical Gardens,"Cairns is a subtropical climate so naturally their Botanical Gardens are going to be representative of that.  Our bus tour guide was not particularly great so she wasn‚Äôt too clear as to what was best to do & had trouble finding the garden maps (which were by the Cafe‚Äôs counter).  It would have been nice to have had more time to explore.  Be aware if you have allergies, the damp environment & flora will impact you."
Beautiful place to spend half a day,"Visited Carins Botanic Gardens recently and just loved it. Also had lunch at the cafe. Before we realised, we spent hours at this place."
Beautiful,This is a good place to walk around. There are a few different walks for different abilities. Definitely worth a look
Beautiful,"Apart from the unlucky weather, I had a beautiful stroll in the gardens. We also had lunch at the garden caf√© which was yum but a little expensive for a backpacker."
So many beautiful plants!,"I visited the gardens today as part of a Segway tour with Cairns Ninebot. Excellent tour, beautiful scenery. And, the Segway allowed me to see much of the gardens quickly and easily."
Beautiful area.,"Lots of area, walking tracks, boardwalks, a caged indoor area with some of the highlighted plant species.Close to restaurants and shops of the great suburb of Edge Hill.Can spend a day walking around the lot!"
It was okay,Many objects was closed in time I was there. But anyway those which was open was very nice. I liked it.
Tropical Paradise,These gardens may not be the biggest but absolutely worth a visit. Has a nice cafe located in the grounds. Really nice spot for families to picnic and admire all the beautiful tropical plants at there best.
Nice free day out,"This is a good place to walk around, especially if your on a budget as it‚Äôs free!!  There are a few different walks for different abilities Well worth a look"
An asset to the city of Cairns,"Loved our time at the gardens. Is it a credit to the city of Cairns, so many great species of plants, and so many in flower when we visited."
Beauty and the rainforest ,"This wonderful botanical gardens is the home to many exotic flowers and plants.  It has good walkways from which to enjoy the fabulous displays.  The cafe as a rest stop is to be recommended, where the staff are very friendly.  There is a rainforest walk opposite.  Sadly areas of the botanic gardens were shut.  Visitors should check opening times carefully."
