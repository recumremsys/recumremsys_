top of the beaches in mauritius,well yes top of the top private beach and also a lot space on public beach its amazing but we felt strong currency in the water on some spots so be careful but enyoj one of the best places
Simply stunning ,"My wife and I visited for the afternoon and found the beach and colour of the ocean breathtaking.There is lots of broken coral in the sand, which can make walking barefoot uncomfortable, but from our experience this is common in Mauritius.I‚Äôd certainly recommend a visit!"
Gorgeous swim and beach,"Lots of white sand.  Good area for swimming.  Very clean.  Beach does have a lot of broken coral, which are sharp and can cut easily.  Not too crowded so experience was very pleasant.  We spent the whole day there."
"Gorgeous, but rocky!","This beach is visually stunning. White sand and the most beautiful blue water. However, the sand is SO rocky and therefore very uncomfortable under your feet. Once we had eaten lunch, we only stayed on the actual beach for about half an hour because it is definitely not suitable for bathing!"
Just a coffee stop,What a fantastic place!! Just stopped for coffee and Vik and Rodee treated me as if I was the queen myselfüòä Beautifully situated right at a white sandy beach!!And not unimportant....the coffee is wonderfull‚òï and a true piece of art!
Loved this place,"Our favourite beach on the whole of Mauritius. Lots of white sand, very clean, not many people there (slightly away from all the kite-surfers and car needed to get there). Definitely worth a visit if you have a car."
"Amazing sunsets, not very suited for bathing","Not the Best Beach to bathe, almost all the time it is windy. Has a lot of corals and algae.BUT it is an amazing place to look at and has the most Beautifull and romatic sunsets."
Calm Beach with Green Blue Water,"We rented a car to drive around Mauritius and drove from the Westin Turtle Bay in Balaclava. We came for a quick visit before our lunch reservations at Le Chamarel Restaurant.  The parking lot had plenty of parking and it was free.The beach is calm and the water has a really pretty blue greenish color.  We came on a Sunday, September 15 and it seems to be a popular beach for locals."
Stunning beach,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I've seen in my life! You can walk up Le Morne mountain and then see kite-surfers on the beach. Reserve whole day for being here! I think hotels in this area are quite expensive having St.Regis and Lux Morne located here.
Le Morne Beach,Nice beach popular with kitesurfers so very windy especially in the winter months.Beautiful backdrop of Le Morne mountain.Fast food available and toilet facilities.
Favorite beach,This is definitely my favorite beach in mauritius. The colors of the water are sooo beautiful and le morne in the back is beautiful as well.
Good beach ,We stop by Le Morne beach on our multi stop trip. The view was beautiful. However the beach was not as good as some others that we have been too. We stop at Le Morne for lunch. There is also a stunning view of the Le Morne Brabant Mountain and Ile aux Fournase.
Best beach in Mauritius,"Nice beach and clear water.Notice: July and August are wintertime in Mauritius, rainy,windy and the water is too cold for swimming."
Lovely beach,"Yet another beautiful Mauritius beach with soft sand and crystal water.  This is a decent stretch of sand so a good place to stroll.  Parking is easy, plentiful and free.  Popular with wind and kite surfers during certain months - they are fun to watch!"
Mauritius' most beautiful beach,Mauritius has a number of pretty beaches but this one is considered the most beautiful and one of the ten most beautiful beaches in the world.  It's situated n the southwest below the Le Morne mountains.  Worth a trip to or a divination while visiting other sites in the southwest.
Camp in tents with family and friends,We decided to camp in tents with family and friends at the public beach of Le Morne. The weather was beautiful and fine. We left Friday morning and went back home on Sunday afternoon.  We had a wonderful weekend there. The sea was good and there was a beautiful sun for a winter time. We brought all our belongings and the beach was for us.
Beautiful,"Very nice beach, and very clean as well.  We enjoyed a sunset walk here after a long day before heading to our resort in the south."
Another great beach on Mauritius!,I had really enjoyed coming here as well last month given that the views were awesome; the sand smooth and the waters suitably sparkling!
THINK TWICE before doing a dolphin swimming trip!,"I've read a lot of great reviews about the dolphins swimming trips in Mauritius but after taking a trip this morning,I find it hard to imagine how anyone can class it as 'one of the best experiences in my life' or 'totally unforgettable'...?! For me, it was quite the opposite. Don't get me wrong for the very short 3-5 seconds you 'swim' with the dolphins it was really nice, but it takes away from the experience when there's more swimmers than dolphins and when there's anything from 9 to 14 boats swarming around the ONE school of dolphins!  I asked the skipper if they Govt limits the number of boats which are allowed to swim around the dolphins and he said 'no', there can be as many boats as people like.In order to be fair - Dolswim as a firm were efficient and well-organized (this is, after all, a well-oiled machine with hundreds of tourists going out probably per day);  the communication with the company via WhatsApp was prompt and they got me on a trip after only booking the day before. Dolswim, from what I understand, is perhaps one of only a few companies which limits the number of swimmers (2 people from each boat at anyone time) to swim with the dolphins. Sadly, some other companies and private boats, allow the whole boat to jump off (sometimes up to 10 people from one boat, where we had only 2). This is a credit to Dolswim, but the experience for me was not particularly enjoyable. It's pretty frantic with the skipper shouting ""go go"" for us to jump in so we can get our 5 seconds (maybe a bit more if you're lucky) with the dolphins. Obviously, they are wild animals and move pretty fast, so if you have any notion of this being some intimate experience with you and dolphin spending quality time in the water, then you'll be disappointed. I knew this would be the case but didn't think the sheer volume of boats would be surrounding the animals. Watching the dolphins from the boat was honestly more enjoyable.Skipper & crew were average. Nothing bad but also nothing good to say. ZERO and I mean no information was provided on the dolphins, other than 'they are spinner dolphins'. That was it - no education, no little nuggets on their species, behavior, etc.Snorkelling was about 15 mins and uninspiring - saw a couple of black&white fish and some brown corral.Would not recommend."
"Dolphin watching , snorkeling, sunset seeing , lunch on √Æle aux Benitiers   ","Spend  a full day trip on √Æle aux Benitiers , including 2 and half hour dolphin watching , snorkeling . Our boat captain might swim and guide you , and swim with dolphins ."
Very peaceful,We reached here late in the afternoon and stayed till sunset. The beach was not crowded and one could have privacy. Very nice scenic and clean too. Loved the beach.
Very picturesque,"We were staying further up the coast but wanted to see this beach. It is really nice but having seen it not one we would look to stay at.There are a couple of reasons for this. The sea seems quite rough and make swimming and snorkelling quite treacherous. Also, there is not absolutely lots of things to do around the place in terms of bars and restaurants.That said, the views are amazing and it would be great for a long beach walk."
Great local beach to hang out,"When you are in the water you can make great foto's of Le Morne Brabant. Also the public beach is amazing, friendly local people come te relax here. I loved every minute of it."
Cristal clear and Sandy beach,The beach of Le Morne is easy to find and to access with good parking place. Clean neat and some small local stalls shops to buy some fruits or pashminas saris. Great üëçüèª
Long attractive public beach,Long beach backed by shade providing trees with a few food outlets and toilet blocks.At weekends it is busy but still with plenty of spare space if you walk a short distance from the car parks.
Great public Beach,"The public beach (the one nearest the town) is superb and better than the hotel beaches further up the cost. There is a good array of bars, restaurants and street food just behind the beach.We were not hassled by anyone and the people we met were very kind."
Beautiful,Pretty much ticks all of the boxes. Take your snorkel and your water shoes but just keep an eye on all of the kite-surfers while you're swimming with the fishes.
Perfect,"We had a great time here. It has white sand and clear blue water. Trees are close enough to have some shade but the best parts is going for a walk towards the resorts where sea is cut with a low shelf and you can find sea cucumbers, starfish and crabs. Also, the beach has  a nice view on the sunset."
"Beautiful beach, but sometimes a bit rocky","The beach itself is almost picture perfect, with palmtrees and the Morne Brabant in the background. The water is crystal clear and turqoise.But some parts of the beach are a bit rocky, with a lot of dead coral.The area is pretty windy and offers perfect conditions for any wind related water sports.Due to its location it's also the perfect spot for viewing sunsets."
Great spot to watch kitesurfing,"But beware it can get busy on windy days. There is often somewhere to buy fresh fruit and coconuts, but do not rely on this. It is a popular spot for experienced wave riders, with One Eye and Le Manoir on the reef with surf for kiters and surfers, take some binoculars if you want to see this as it is a little way out.  Sit, relax and enjoy."
The most scenic beach of Mauritius,White beach with a sea full of shades that surrounds on three sides the spectacular basalt block of Le Morne Brabant (pity for me not to have climbed up). In my opinion it is the most beautiful and scenic beach of Mauritius. Although there are many resorts the beach is entirely free and anyone can walk around freely.
Kitesurfing Mecca,This lagoon is a kitesurfing mecca and if your not experienced at waterspouts then Id advise you book in with a professional for a lesson. The setting is beautiful and if you don't like sports then you go further down the beach to relax
A lovely drive and fantastic kite surfers,"After visiting Chamarel we decided to drive down to Le Morne and see the beach.  The mountain is a fantastic back drop, we parked up and bought lots of sarongs from a local stall, a lovely couple with a parrot.We drove along the beach road eventually we got to a very uneven section and almost turned back, so glad we didnt as we ended up on the kite surf beach, it was spectacular to see all the bright colourful kites skimming across the water, weaving in and out of each other.UNfortunately, we didnt get chance to revisit as we moved up to the north of the island after this."
Pretty,"Lovely beach, as are most beaches in Mauritius.  Worth stopping if you are passing and if you are staying at Le Morne it is a nice way to spend your holiday"
Incredible piece of coastline,Great trip and le morne beach is stunning and well worth a trip or 2 even. Do hire a car and drive around and visit at different times of the day. Morning and evening is best as it gets busy with locals trippers during afternoon.
Perfect place for a beach walk!,"Beautiful, quiet and peaceful...great place for a picnic or long walk. Also perfect for watersports!"
Awesome Place,"Beautiful landscapings, beach and serenity. You'll be glad you visited. If you are into, photography, you'll get nice and beautiful shots."
Swimming in front of Le Morne Beach,Took a speed boat from the hotel to snorkel on the corals in front of Le Morne Beach. A very nice and interesting experience since the waters were crystal clear and we saw the fish on the corals. The only problem was the place was a little crowded and the coral were not as large as expected. But definitely we had a great experience and would do it again.Dr. M. AlShaibi
Kite and wind surfers,"The long beach wraps around a peninsula which is dotted with beachfront hotels and resorts. A road leads past the hotels and resorts to the tip of the peninsula where wind and kite surfers gather to enjoy the strong winds.It was enjoyable to watch the kite surfers prepare on the beach and launch themselves from the water when the wind picks up their power kites. Many of them are experienced as they perform flips and somersaults on their kite boards. The wind is particularly strong in this area.Further away from the tip of the peninsula, the wind is calmer and the beach is ideal for swimming and picnics. Nearby, visitors can trek up the 556m high Le Morne Brabant mountain.We had an enjoyable afternoon and picnic at Le Morne beach."
What an experience!,"To do PLEASE: Submarine in Port Louis, Catamaran, South Tour.. Stayed at Riu Le Morne (Riu Creole if you have children). You go back home refreshed with a new experience. You can drive your Scooter under water (Yep, you read correctly)! ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"excellent location, poorly maintained","having seen almost all the beaches and facilities in Mauritus, I feel this is one of the less maintained beaches....excellent coast line....wide stretch of beach front..but stinking toilets...non responsive staff.....maybe, I visited at a non touristy time....the Slave route monument facing the beach is a must see....could not see any of the kite types too....the Le Morne Brabant has an overbearing presnecr just above the monument......"
Lovely lazy afternoon watching kite surfers,We have been before and we will certainly visit again as the beach is lovely and there is always a welcome breeze. The kite surfers offer a lovely‚Äôs spectacle watching their stints.  I attach some photos for today‚Äôs visit
A mixed day of weather,"The last beach on the headland is great if you just want to sit or watch the kite surfers - today was quite hot at mid day and most people were enjoying the sun - later the wind was more prevalent and the kite surfers were out - great to watch, stalls selling food and beach wear"
Beautiful,"Only stopped for an hour for a swim and snorkel, beautiful beach and much better than the beaches to the north of the island which is where we were staying, if we go to Mauritius again this will be the area we come to."
Kite,If you you are coming right now probably you will find a lot of people because now is the season for kite starting and day to day the wind is getting stronger. The place is beautiful but you can not find any restaurants or snacks at the beach so you must bring water and food if you don't want to drive around 5 minutes by car to the next decent restaurant. Water a little bit cold so you will need a neoprene. And you will find a lot of people renting so I recommend asking three or four times before taking a kite.
Crystal clear blue water in January/February!,"Surrounded by all kinds of beaches, Mauritius surely has a lot to offer for a beach lover! Le Morne beach is absolutely one of the best, especially in January/February (when I was there for a short stay), when the weather is fine, and water is crystal clear blue. We spent two days on the Le Morne beach: one day just relaxing on the sand and some snorkeling, the other day we did horseback riding on the beach, and swimming with the horses. absolutely extraordinary experience! I'd definitely recommend to stay in an airbnb in La Gaulette. Fair price, easy access to all the destinations in the southwest (15 mins drive to Le Morne beach, right behind the major route to Chamarel etc.), and close to a big supermarket.Follow my Instagram ""ambswang"" for more pics from traveling the world!"
stunning place with stunning views of ocean,We stayed at Riu hotel for one week and we enjoyed the beach so much especially our 1 year son. however some parts are a bitt stony so i would advise to wear shoes. The views of the ocean are amazing and water clean with loads of places suitable for snorkelling.
"Very nice beach and ocean view, incredible colours","If you like the ocean view, and the excellent colurs of the ocean don't forgot to make a short trip to Le Morne beach. You will find, especially on sunny days, the most beautiful pictures view for the beach and ocean, from this south part of the island.When planing the trip take taxi with AZAD the best driver we meet there, corect prices, very good and patient driver, call him on mobile/whatsapp +23057019495"
One of the best beaches of Mauritius!,Nice and clean beach! Especially during the week it is a nice and quiet beach with good opportunities to snorkel and enjoy the Mauritian weather üòÄ
one of best beach in Mauritius,very very beautiful place with white sands beaches. perfect place to lay on the beach for all day long. it hs very bautiful views to La Morne Mauntain.
Beautiful beach,"One of the most beautiful beaches in Mauritius! We went there after one excursion, and we relaxed quite a bit. But be careful with the strong current :)"
the best beach in Mauritius,"This beach is a stunning piece of Mauritius. Classified as a World Heritage Site, thus kept in pristine condition. the diving here was stunning and the coral beautiful."
Good beach,But not the best of the island (that would be Pereybere). Still worth a stop as part of a drive on the west coast. The Morne Brabant offers a nice backdrop to the beach.
"THE BEST BEACH LOCATION OF MAURITIUS, HOWEVER SAND STARTS TO MISS AT SOME PLACES !!!","Le Morne Beach is probably the most beautiful beach of Mauritius, because located between the awesome Le Morne mountain and a magnificent lagoon with blue colors and not deep. However, after more than 10 stays in Mauritius, we noticed that the sand starts to miss more and more ! Specially around Dinarobin and Le Paradis Hotel, it easily lost 2 meters of height since our last stay 4 years ago. Nature and erosion is removing this beautiful sand to put it more and more between Ile aux Benitiers and Le Paradis Hotel. Enjoy the beach now if you can, because nobody knows how it will look like in 10 years...I will soon post some photos for you to see how it looked like in December 2017, you can also check my previous photos of 2013 and check the sand level difference.So, enjoy and see you there as soon as possible for me to come back ;-).otterboris (#wherethehellisboris)."
Beautiful Beach,"We walked along this beach and it is quite hard to walk on an uneven surface, the sands are rough however the beach further along this place is beautiful and very natural. lots of shells in the sand, the seas are calm when the wind drop, this is heaven for wind surfers and we saw many activities along this coast wind surfing, there are areas in the sea that is clear enough to swim many visitors were swimming, sea shoes are advisable. The scenery is spectacular, far views of the mountains are quite breath taking- The sea breeze is welcoming and fresh, during peak hot season it feels very cool, overall a very nice place but public transport are limited."
Not what you would expect,"The beach is nothing special, far from the perfect postcard image that one usually associates with it. There are nicer parts (where the hotels are) but there are many rocks. You will need shoes! The sand is not as white or smooth as we expected. It makes for a couple nice photos but we were disappointed given that it‚Äôs the most famous beach in Mauritius."
Idealic but be aware,Lovely beach though can be course underfoot. Not much to snorkell and can be quite windy though east and west a bit does provide some beautiful shelter with fantastic views to the reef.
Beautiful beach & lagoon,"Beautiful beach, lagoon and really hot weather. Nice relaxing place , you can have views of the magnificent mountain in front of the beach, islands not far. Chamarel where you can have lots of activities is 10 mins drive. We choose to take the sky parachute from this beach. Was unforgettable experience."
Nice for kite(surfers),"Nice beach not overcrowded. Take care, like everywhere on Mauritius, there is a big difference if you visit this beach on sunny day or cloudy day. Uncomparable feeling. There is also a lack of restaurants and bars. If you are lucky, you'll find some truck (mobile restaurant) with simple snacks and juices in a nearby park.All in all, you can spend a few nice hours on it."
Great beach for an afternoon,"Nice public beach, quiet a bit which hasn't been occupied by resorts. Like all other public beaches were we missing any nice restaurants and bars. Water was perfect."
Unspoilt public beach,A beautiful natural white sand/coral beach backed by pine trees to provide shade. There are cordoned off sections of the sea where it is safe to swim protected from the speed boats. There are various water sports available. Along the beach in both directions are exclusive boutique hotels but the public are allowed to walk along the beach in front of them. There are a few street food vans in the car park at the public beach which are very welcome and unobtrusive. We visited during the week and it was fairly quiet and peaceful.
Nice scenic quiet beach,"We went there towards late afternoon and were there till sunset.Nice quiet beach, not at all crowded. And great views. Not sure if it's ideal for swimming."
Best beach on the island ,"If you go there during the week, avoiding crowded periods you will get a little piece of paradise all of your own. You‚Äôll get the paradise Twain have been talking of. Just breath deep and close your eyes..."
Nice Beach with Slave memorial cross the street,"The Beach is located next to Beachcomber Dinarobin resort. In fact in Arabic before Europeans ""finding"" the island it was called Dina Arobi, which can be translated Desert Island or Square island. We stopped here to cool down after climbing to Le Morne Brabant and hiking back from there.Beach is very nice, at parking lot was a food truck selling food. Also public bathroom is available. Consider wearing swimming shoes because of the corral.Cross the street is the Slave memorial park called ""International Slave Route Monument""."
Nice beach ,"The public beach is long and nice. There are public toilets, free parking and some luxury resorts. There was very windy. There was only one fast food."
Wonderful setting,"This public beach is situated along the coast from our hotel, Riu Le Morne, a few minutes walk away. It is on the west coast of the island. The beach is easily accessible from the coastal road.¬†There always seems to be a breeze/windy here so very popular with wind surfers and kite surfers. It is a¬†spectacular scene to see a large number of surfers and kite boarders with their colourful sails and their manouveurs across the water and in the air.This is a white coral sandy beach with clear but sometimes choppy waters, it is also ideal for snorkeling. There were some local people fishing in the water as we walked by.It is advisable when walking the beach to wear rubber or plastic beach shoes as there are some rough bits of coral which could hurt walked on.Enjoy a stroll along the beach with the amazing backdrop of Mourne Barbant, World Heritage Site. We walked from our hotel down the beach past the impressive Saint Regis Hotel after the hotel, we took the pathway up to car park No.2 and took the roadway back to our hotel. In total it took us over an hour, however we were stopping along the way."
Picture perfect,"Le Morne beach is a picture perfect tropical beach with the stunning backdrop of Le Morne Brabant (mountain top). Only draw back is that most of the beach is lined with luxury hotels, offering sun beds for their hotel guests. But the beach itself is public. The far end of the beach is windy and popular to kiters."
Definitely one of our favorites!!,This beach is absolutely gorgeous! The beach is clean and the sea is picture perfect. There is ample parking for your vehicle. The food vendors are friendly and their food is tasty and not expensive. Its a must!
Beautiful island,"In my opinion, the most beautiful beach in Mauritius. If you start your stroll at the beginning of this beach and continue south, up to where the Kite surfers are,  you will get to see some really beautiful sceneries. There are also various places for eating, and also a cart with nice bracelets and some other souvenirs. The marine life is great for snorkelling, especially in the part situated in front of St Regis. Free parking options you also find a lot. In front of the resorts, it is also very clean, but the rest of this beach is, unfortunately, like most of the beaches in Mauritius, also with garbage.."
Scenic beach,"One of the best public beaches we visited in Mauritius. The water and sand are gorgeous. Too, the grounds were kept clean and the toilets are accessible. As a whole, the beach attracted a diverse group--families, individuals, foreigners, locals, muslim and hindu. This is a great place to see the diversity of Mauritius. Parking is ample and free."
Pretty Public Beach,"I prefer the private beaches, but this is definitely one of the best public beaches in Mauritius. The sand stretches for kilometres, and it is very pretty, and quite clean. You have great views of Le Morne (which is the mountain) and the sea is quite clam until you hit the reef which is nearby."
Windy beach,If you are a keen wind surfer this is the place for you. There is also a good restaurant with reasonable prices
One of many beautiful beaches,"Well,  it's a beach.  Beautiful white sandy beach leading to a shallow lagoon before the reef.  Much like many other beaches on the island."
Don't know were to look ,We were staying in the North of Mauritius and we went to the South Le morne for a few days. Le Morne is beautiful and has lots of nice things to offer. In the North they say that the weather is better. But the South is more dreamy to stay. In Le morne you can easy go to Chamarel and Tamarin. Also you can do Deep Sea fishing and enjoy the few ad the mountains. You have the 7 colors earth. And a Long Beach were you can walk along. So if you wanna stay in the best place with a priceless view. Stay in Le more.
Beautiful serene beach : must see sunset,Beautiful beach with a great view of the sunset. Many locals visit and set up chairs to see the sunset. Clean beach with lot of small corals and peaceful public.
The best beach!,There is no one!!! Corals are fantastic!!! Absolutely calm beach!!! I think is the best beach in all the island!!! No one screams and people are happy!!!We were
Paradise,"This is the most beautiful beach I have ever been to and I have been to a few! It's just crystal clear water with white sand, not too many people and a paradisiacal location !"
Worth the drive ,"Nice and large public beach on the west coastClean with public toilets that is maintained, good for kids tooBusy beach but still makes a nice time out with family"
Most beautiful and isolated beach in Mauritius,"After 2 months on the island, I can highly recommend this beach and even say that is the most beautiful... White sand, crystal clean water, nearly not waves.... a real paradise. Suitable for children and adults that want to enjoy an isolated, relaxing place. A recommendation, to get around on the island you better rent a car as the taxis are excessively expensive, especially around Le Morne as there are only 5 stars hotels."
Great place to relax,"While in South West of Mauritius you should visit this place and relax, not great to swim due to corals, rocks. but a great place to relax with a view of Le Morne Barbant Mountain behind."
Stunning,"Has to be seen to be believed. Absolutely glorious. White beaches, stunning mountain backdrop, crystal clear water..."
Nice beach,"We have spent 1 day at Le Morne beach and enjoeyd it. Sunset wasn't great as there were clouds covering, Nice food in the local shops by the beach. I would recommend visiting this beach as it is different to East side of the island."
Nice clean beach,"We had a couple of trips to Le Morne.  There were plenty of available parking spots both during the week and at weekend although the beach is busier on Sundays when the local families are enjoying themselves too.A walk across the grass and through the trees brought us to the beach, it was clean, the sea clear and plenty warm enough to swim in. My husband is teaching our friend's 8 year old son to snorkel so he will try at every chance he gets but they reported there was nothing at all to see underwater.The big let down with a day here are the public conveniences/changing rooms, both ladies and gents.  They are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  The floors are wet and there was no running water let alone soap or towels/hand drier. I'll leave it there."
One of the best beaches in Mauritius,"It is a long beach in front of the big rock of Le Morne, or at least this is what we visited - there may be other sections of the beach. It is not very wide, but the sea is shallow and the sand and the many trees next to it are pleasant for swimming, sunbathing and lying in the shade - as you like it."
Best Mauritius Beach,"Great beach, mostly occupied by resorts (LUX* La Morne), but there is also nice public beach area. You have big free car parking space available, so no problem to find a free spot."
A beautiful if popular beach,"The beach at Le Morne is set in a beautiful area where you have to wander through the Casuarina trees to access it. It is very popular with locals, particularly at the weekend. Views are spectacular looking over an azure sea to distant wind kiters. Worth a visit"
The most beautiful beach where I have been,The view from this beach is out of this world thanks to the mountain just in front. The water here is the most cristalline... paradise
Mesmerizing turquoise waters,"Beach here is absolutely beautiful. Not as many rocks as flic en flac beach but still recommend having water shoes. Water is clear, clean, and hardly any waves. Few places to eat around the area. Great for families, couples, friends or even solo travellers."
Lovely public beach,This public beach sits between lux le morne and Dinarobin and is definitely worth a visit. Surrounded by pine trees it is a relaxing and beautiful setting.
"White sand, blue water","Le Morne beach is a beautiful long white sandy beach with brilliant blue waters. The current is not strong here, so is good for swimming, however, the beach is not the best for snorkelling as there is simply not much to see underwater.Le Morne itself is slightly out-of-the-way, so you would have to plan to go there. We went in a hire car. Parking for the beach is easy, and we got an insight into how the locals relaxed as many were having BBQs on the day that we visited.There are many snack stalls near the beach, we would recommend a fresh coconut.Beautiful setting with Le Morne Brabant as a brackdrop."
A Lovely Beach for Wind Surfing,"When you are in Mauritius, there are so many beautiful places to see & visit that sometimes one feels , the time planned for this lovely place is too short for fully enjoying the Holidays. The whole country is a enjoyable Picnic spot.Le Morne Beach is one such place in the south - west of the country surrounded by a beautiful Golf course on one side & rock solid tall mountain on the other side. This Beach is famous for wind surfing as you get good breeze suitable for enjoying wind-surfing. Wind Surfers will enjoy this Beach which is not very crowded but has wast long spiraling beautiful beach to enjoy your holiday here"
Beautiful beach,"As a Mauritian, my favourite beach is definitely Le Morne beach. The first public beach (in front of the restaurant Embafilao) is really nice. The beach is white and the swim is excellent. To top it off, there is a nice restaurant on the beach where you can have a nice beer."
nothing special,You definitely need shoes - many rocks and shells. There is windy just near the mountain where are kite surfing center - that is nice. But in the small bays there is extremely hot. Far away from all places. You will need a car.
Beautiful ,"Love this beach!  Very much like Maui ( without waves ).  The green lawn in front of actual beach makes this very attractive and a great hangout or picnic spot. Nice and laid back, good swimming area ."
"Must visit public beach in Mauritius, one of the best beaches on the island!","Wonderful beach hidden away in the south of the island, you can get there by car, bus or taxi, plenty of parking available. Beautiful sandy beach, peaceful, with beatiful clear blue water. I visited in May/June 2015 and water calm suitable for anyone, in December 2016 water a bit rough but still ok for confident swimmers; though weather had been rough so that might be the reason the water had a current at the time so if you have children swim with them as it changed during the day! You can take your own food or buy food and eat at cafe which is clean & has clean toilets. There are also public toilets and sometimes stalls where you can buy food. Access to the beach if looking on a map is next to the Lux hotel, if you have a family it might be worth checking out local hotels and b&b's for more reasonable places to stay so you can spend a whole day here! This is my favourite beach on the island, beautiful views, water & sand; can be very peaceful. It is a very safe location, clean and once again amazing views of the coast and the hills. Take your own chairs, mats, as well as towels I don;t think you can rent them there, take a umbrella if you want to relax on the beach and remember suntan lotian as if there is a breeze it can seem cool but the sun can be strong! Great for children and people of all ages, couples, families and groups."
the hidden mauritius,"Le morne peninsula has it all,numerous 5 stars hotel, an authentic village that is nothing like the other places in maurius,different kind of beaches.By the hotels you have nice clean aseptical beaches.... after the village you have the kite surfers spot  and just before the village you have nice quiet beaches ( Pointe d amour)  and in the village itself you have a pier  and if you are a good swimmer 200 mts off the pier you have a small island, isle aux fourneaux..."
Nice Beach,"A large tree lined beach with plenty of parking. Nice beach restaurant. If you put your towel down on ground make sure it's clear of pine needles , seconds to adhere and ages to remove them."
loveliest beach,"the softest water, good ambience among other sunbathers, dramatic setting with beautiful montains and filao trees. i loved this beach!"
Possibly the best public beach on the island,"We came here after the hike at Le Morne Brabant and it was so refreshing to just dip in the water. There is public toilet to change and I'm taking off a star because the condition is pretty bad for a nice beach like this. Otherwise, surrounding area is clean, sand is soft like most beaches we are used to in South East Asia and water is crystal clear. Be warned though the public food stall only starts operating from noon onwards so you may find yourself starving for a bit if you've worked out earlier during the hike."
"Amazing stretch of beach, especially on the east side for kite surfers","We spent and afternoon on both sides of the beach at Le Morne. One at the public beach, which was so-so. One at the south tip, which was very nice. The best, for my family, was just chilling at the kite surfing beach, where the water was at most knee deep. Watching the kite surfers was quite relaxing. The beach there wasn't the best, but it had some stretch to lay down, chill and enjoy the sun, and wind. Spend hrs there on the last day just to relax."
Amazing beach,I came there in the evening time. Place was empty but amazing ocean view and white sand. Love this place and recomend to go. For me it was little bit quiet and prefer north- west of the island.
Prettiest beach in Mauritius,"We traveled from west to north and east.And stopped by at all kinda beaches in mauritius..Le Morn is by far the prettiest beach there is.It is quite It is empty.it has perfect tricolor that makes it magical.It is perfect.Be careful of the stone fish though..Locals have been warning me that there are sighting of stonefish..which is quite venomous.And another note, if its quite windy..the wind surfers are coming.If can be quite a sight..with colorful sails moving everywhere..But if you like quiet...try to go in the afternoon."
Great Beach,just a fantastic beach... from private hotels to public parks this beach is just awesome. nice spots to swim or relax on shore.
ideal for stay,very nice long beach where you can be alone if you want. amazing panorama. nice white sand and clear water
Surfer's beach,"When we visited Le Morne beach, it was full of surfers and even few enthusiasts with drones. Nice views of the ocean, not too crowded, one of the beaches that is not too ""touristy""."
Could be nice .... but ...,"This beach has all it would take to be a dream-destination ... however pollution spoils it all. And with polution I do not only mean the empty bottles, plastic plates and wrapping paper of the last picknicks ... but more than anything the noise! Jetskies start at - or rather before 6 am (as they were there already, when I arrived), long before people came to the beach. I was surprised by the dirt and the smelliness of the water - I thought the Ocean had some selfcleaning properties. But obviously within the lagoon created by the coral reef, this system could not cope with the amount of sewer being introduced there. Mauritius has no sewege plants, so most waistwater goes straight to the sea. It's o.k.to know this, but it's not o.k. to smell it. So I went there once during my trip, as I lived close ... but there are better spots on this island!"
Lovely beach,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was reasonably quiet compared to other nearby beaches such as Flac en Flac.There are facilities nearby and the usual ice cream and soft drinks vendors too.The water was great, probably a little choppier than other beaches but typically beautiful and clear, great for swimming."
Worth a visit,An attractive beach with lovely views along the coast. Where we stopped there were no facilities but the water looked most inviting
Dirty,Very windy it is suitable for surfing. No way for swimming. Lots os stones and seaweeds. You have to wear sea shoes
Nice free beach! ,"This beach is located between two hotels in the morne, it is just in the tip of the peninsula. The sand is not great as it is quite thick but the water is splendid! Refreshing and beautiful blue. Great for a dip after hiking Le Morne Brabant!"
very nice beach,"One of the best beaches in Mauritius, with breathtaking view and just seeing the Morne Brabant is spectacular"
Hot !,"Beautiful beach, lagoon and really hot weather. Nice place for children, you can have views of the magnificent mountain in front of the beach, islands not far. Chamarel where you can have lots of activities is 10 mins drive."
Excellent beach,"We visited it after hike to LeMorne. It has a great vibe, it's very clean, Access to water in just perfect. A lot of shade and free parking near by. There are also locals selling food."
Perfect for a calm day,"Sea is at great depth and temperature, facilities not so clean but managable. If you want to be in a calm atmosphere with great nature then this is definitely the best beach of mauritius."
wonderful,"very often my clients ask me to bring them to le morne.Not only for the beach but also for the mountain.Specially during weekends,the beach is full of people coming to relax or for having fun"
Kitesurf and winsurf,"On a previous visit, Le Morne beach was lashing with rain. This time the weather was better and the kite surfers were out in force which was a wonderful sight. It is not a beach I would swim in given the amount of activity going on, but the peninsula is definitely the place to be if you want to do windsurfing and kitesurfing."
WOW.  What a lovely beach.  Picture perfect!,"Le Morne beach is a narrow strip that stretches for a long way.  It is a beautiful spot to just chill out for a few hours and dip you toes in the crystal clear sea.  Wade out a little and then tunr back towards the beach and you will have the mountain in the background.  This makes a stunning photo.We loved this beach and visited more than once.  You also have the slavery memorial adjacent to the beach.  This is interesting, and well worth stopping in to see."
White Sandy Beach,the crystal water with the white sands is the greatest combination that you can have in your honeymoon trip. Just you need to ask for this location where you can enjoy this combination (since there is some reefs)
Beautiful white sand beach,"A really beautiful beach. Judging by some of the beaches we saw from the coach from the airport, this could be one of the best on the Island."
Coral reef,"The beach is nice and quite and very shallow which makes it ideal for children. The sand and coral is not like the Maldives, but still there is many different fish"
Kiting Mecca,The backdrop is stunning! Totally loved it. The culture is chillax and everyone is helpful. You gotta drive right to the end past the cobbled roads to get to the public kite beach.
Kitesurfers Paradise,"This is really a hot-spot for windsurfers and kitesurfers!They are reaching incredibly high Speed.Even so, there is also an area which is closed to them where you can swim."
Best beach in the south.,"Must visit for a relaxing day under the sun. Its a little steep, but thats the fun part. There are trees for shade, nice food and very less people!Water sports options aplenty."
Great sunset!,Getting here was a little tricky for us but somehow we managed. It is a very nice beach with Le Morne mountain in the background. Beautiful place to spend some time. Sunset in this area is stunning.
Beautiful sunset,"This beach is stunning, if you walk down the left side there is beautiful mountains and scenery.  Here is where you could get the best sunset I'n Mauritius. It is a brilliant place to go if you like water sports such a wind surfing, left go the beach is really windy so is perfect for that if you walk 1-2 minutes to the right there is no wind at all."
beautiful :),"really nice beach :) think its mostly for surfers, not really to swim far, underwaterfall near by. but we settled in front off known resort, nobody seemed to mind. we managed to convince the staff to sell us cocktails, thanks a lot for that :) just set there, in the water, drinking mojito, enjoying the view :)))"
Mrs,Our family had a lovely time at this beach the water was clean & clear & we throughly enjoyed the watching the Kite surfers. Warning though there was a very strong sea current.
Amazing Beach,"This is among the best places to watch the sunset in Mauritius. The white sand beaches add to the beauty. However, there are lots of corals & stones so ensure you wear proper footwear."
Le Morne Beach @ Mauritius,One of the best beaches in Mauritius with glorious views of sunsets. White sand beaches have a special appeal and visually the Le Morne beach does not let one down in that regard. It can however be hard on the feet as there are a lot of stones and coral in the sand. Do wear appropriate footwear for this one lest you hurt your feet.
Nic beach,"You'll get a beautiful sunset there. The place is a bit windy, which makes it best for kite surfing."
Best place in the world to watch the sun set,This is such a beautiful beach and by far the most amazing place to watch the sun set that i have ever been too
... best beach of Mauritius ...,"... if you wat to choose the best beach of Mauritius than its definitely Le Morne beach... I was in three places during my stay on this beautiful island /in Le Morne, in the north - Trou Aux Biches and in the south near the airport/ and I have to say that Le Morne was the best... it is really stunning beach and if I can give you advice than choose LUX* Le Morne hotel which I will not forget :)"
Very windy...,it is a must place to see drive around the mountain since there is a lot to see. there is the kite beach but it is windy. you can drive around it and see it. The hotels offer a tour to see it and climb it but we did it alone. We drove there and we walked
Day out in Le Morne was heaven ,"Took a taxi to Le Morne for the day from bel ombr√© took about 20 minutes.. Wow what a stunning place.. We lazed around the public beach next to Lux Le Morne.. Beautiful beach stunning water, swam relaxed and ate a super lunch at the cafe on the beach.. Took a walk too.. Such  a relaxing  stunning place.. Next time I want to stay here.."
Pristine waters surrounded by reef.,"Because the whole island is surrounded by a reef, the waters along the coast are tranquil and clear. The sand, which is more ""shelly"" than I am use to, does take some getting use to as it was a little uncomfortable to walk barefoot at first."
Lunch on the beach ,We enjoyed a loverly home cooked meal on the beach today ... loverly clean sand and clear ocean ... friendly people and lucky us there was a concert on yay
The best beach in Mauritius,"We have spent ten days in Mauritius travelling around and spending the afternoons on different public beaches. And this one was the best for me. Open sea, the view at the mountain when I was swimming, very peaceful and quite, just great atmosphere for relaxing day out. The sand was beautiful hot and the water warm so I did not want to come out at all. There are few stands with refreshment and an outdoor hotel restaurant. There was also a wedding on the beach which looked so romantic. I really loved it!"
A must for a kiter!,"The best spot in the island for kiter,, nice landscape and coulors; if not into sports restaurant and facilities are provided not far frm the famous beach"
Beautiful beach and clear water,One of the most beautiful beaches with the mountain behind you and crystal water in front of you. Definitely worth a visit to go snorkelling and one of the few beaches with a bathroom for public use.
Very nice beach,"Very nice beach in Mauritius. Especially when you stay on some of the hotels beaches. Nice relax, white sand and blue sea :)"
Water Sport paradise,Our hotel was situated on la Morne beach.  Due to the reef it is a waterproof parodies especially for the kite surfers which is exciting to watch.  Sand is not the fine refined sand that can be founda little way around the coastline but I d hours my time here
Great blue beach,"Very nice beach because of it's blue water, perfect for windsurf because of the wind. There's not much sand though, but you can lie on the grass !"
Great day on the beach,"This beach was great, turquoise waters and nice sand. Nice little diner on the beach, serving simple but good dishes. Beware very strong currents even only a couple of meters ashore. We did an hours trip with a glassboat, and had great views of corrals and fish"
Just walk and swim!,"Astonishing stretch of white sandy beach with gently sloping sand under the water. Some great coves. A lot of locals visit the public parts of the beach at weekends, but they're very friendly and no bother."
Tropical paradise,As we had rented a car we were able to see numerous parts of the island and loved this beach. The water is so clear and you can see the tropical fish swimming off shore if you go snorkeling. Just beautiful
Really nice beach,"We visited this beach during our car drive around the island. It was actually one of the nicest beaches we seen in Mauritius - delicate sand (but not as delicate as on Baltic Sea), clear warm water (but unfortunately not much to see when going into it with snorkeling equipment). Also Northern part of this 'hammer-shapped' peninsula had nice beaches than the Southern part where are hotels - there were more algea in water and on the sand.We spent there quite a nice time resting, swimming and sunbathing."
Clean beach,I loved the beach of Mauritius which has clean water and white sand which is great experience to go through this whole area
Beautiful...,"This is the beach where you will experience the perfect combination of peace, white sands and blue water. It is a MUST to experience in Mauritius. You will love it..."
very clean water,"good beach, enjoyed spending day on the beach side and crystal clear water. Hotel provides excellent beachside service."
Stunning Honeymoon Setting,"Absolutely beautiful! Crystal clear shallow waters, filled with tropical fish - perfect for snorkelling. Paradise on earth!"
"Beautiful beach, gorgeous sunset",Le Morne was one of my favourite places on Mauritius. The beach is lovely and the shallow turquoise waters are perfect for snorkelling and swimming. There are several options for water sports enthusiasts here.The best part about Le Morne was the beautiful view of the setting sun
Kite surfing paradise,"Beautiful Beach and more Wind then on the West coast. I like coming to this Beach, a Calm Beach, with a few food shops. One with god coffee, pancakes, and panini with nutella."
Land of Paradise,"Le Morne is one of the prettiest place in the planet i ever seen... Deep blue sea and group of dolphin dance can make the trip joyful... It is also famous place for Kite surfing, most importantly Under Sea Water Falls is one of  the amazing tourist attraction around the world..."
A ideal beach beach,Since the all-inclusive hotels take up most of the beachstretch it gives the rest of the public beach a sort of closed in kind of feeling. There are no sunbeads there and the only shadow is under the trees where the ground is very hard to lie down on...
Big game fishing,"A trip of a lifetime.. Rented out a boat from SOLEIL.. You can see them at the beach.. Two skippers tata and franco""francois"".great guys.. High waves and rain didn't stop landing a 45kg yellow fin tuna after an hour and fifteen minutes fight"
Top 3 beaches in Mauritius!,It¬¥s a exciting feeling to be at the southwest point of Mauritius where you can feel the wind blow from both sides. Kite-surfers love to surf there since the conditions are perfect. When the wind blows on one side you just lay down on the other side of the beach and there the wind will be perfectly still and the water crystal clear. There usually is one food-truck with good food in the afternoon. There is some surf there as well but you need to get out quite far to get to the waves.
Mix type of beach!,So you have some areas of the beach which have crystal clear water while in some areas it is wavy and full of rocks! It is honestly the best beach in Mauritius for me.. It has scenary view over the mountain and the beach! Surfers and kindsurfers might enjoy the wave on the other side while kids and parents may enjoy the blue clear water on the other side.. It is the perfect place to relax. Note that there are no closeby shops and restaurants so make sure to bring enough foods and drinks..
great surfing spot,"this is the beach in Mauritius where you can enjoy nice waves for surfing, and very popular for kite-surfing as well."
Pristine beach at Le Morne,The beach is located right below the Le Morne World Heritage Site and is one of the most beautiful pristine beaches around Mauritius. There is plenty of parking space and gets crowded during weekends when crowds throng the beach. The beach offers a good view of Mount Le Morne. We were unfortunate to not get enough time to spend at the beach and it was just a waypoint on our trip around the island.
Beautiful,"Our hotel was located in Bel ombre where the beaches were lovely but the sea had very strong currents not suitable for snorkelling.  We visited Le Morne first by taxi but could only access the public beach which did not live up to the photos we had previously seen on trip advisor.The best part of Le Morne has definitely been taken by the hotels, we then took a boat trip from bel ombre which took us past st regis hotel to outside the paradis hotel, where we did some snorkelling in calm and beautiful waters, definitely the nicer part of le morne"
Love this part of Mauritius,Love this beach area always nice and peaceful and great place to swim and snorkel. There are toilets near by but take your own loo paper or tissues as they dont use toilet roll. Some nice shady trees around for those that want some shade away from the Hot Summer sun.
Great to just relax,"Do not go to Maritius if you want to travel and see the history. It is pure relaxation, welness, great food, sun and the ocean."
Amaizing beach,"The best beach in mauritius ,blue clear waters white sand ,but i think is even betere by le morne golf club hotell there the beach is just beutiful"
Paradise in the Earth,"Everything about staying in Le Morne was excellent.The place is just like paradise, and if you take the honeymoon package, everything is included, which i think its worth it. They provide additional water activities through the boathouse, which makes the experience fun and entertaining. Nice people, nice place, perfect vacations."
Beach with a view!,I have visited a lot of different beach on the island however this is a bit different to the others due to the mountain behind the beach. It gives it special atmosphere. On one side see is relative stable on the other side rough so you do not need to travel far to experience all. What I was missing is stunning clear water (which you can see for example in Sardinia).
Beautiful Location,We visited this area for a short while & it is truly stunning with the Hill/mountain behind you & the stunning light blue sea protected by the Coral so that it seems to be like a huge swimming pool.Well worth considering a Hotel here- even though they are very expensive.Many sights to visit here too- if you get bored by the sea!
Stunning ,What a beautiful beach! White sand lovely turcois waters you can stand in the water and see the fishes beyond beautiful you can also ride horses on the beach! Restaurant are on the beach with clean bathrooms! A must see
Lots of colour,This is the home of kite surfing and sail boarding in Mauritius. It is a wonderful place to spend the day watching the spectacle of kite surfers jumping out of the water and doing tricks in technicolor. Food is available from a caravan on weekends. There are public toilets available. The winds are best in winter and the European invasion is usually in winter. Close to la Gaulet where reasonable self service accommodation can be found as well as lots of restaurants.
sunrise,Nice beach beautiful clear water. The sand is a little scratchy due to the broken shells and coral. Nice to watch the sunrise over the mountains in the morning.
Wonderful place for a break!,I spent a weekend at the Lux Le Morne and enjoyed thoroughly the beautiful beach and lagoon. Not too much live coral or fish and other creatures to be seen though.
DO NOT USE PHILO DOLPHIN,"In staying at lux*le morne; but on the beach are ""cowboys"" that have licences to use the beach in front of the resort. They have matching blue t-shirts. DO NOT USE!! Always book through the hotel or beach house: as we made that mistake on Tuesday. I thought it was part of the hotel but it turns out the are not. we paid ¬£8000 rupees ( approx ¬£170 ) for a private boat for me and my partner to swim with the Dolphins out at sea. We arrived at 730 am to get on the boat; drove around for about and hour and saw nothing, he then went to the black river and we managed to see 2. Tiny Dolphins so far out you couldn't really make them out. There was over 30 boats all driving around chasing them was a horrible experience.Philo also said the sea was too rough for the good Dolphins and we should try Saturday. In my way of thinking this meant due to we didn't really see them let alone swim with them, we got another chance on Saturday. WRONG. We got off the boat a bit gutted as prior to booking he showed us his book with lovely pictures of people in the sea with the Dolphins, and he had a no dolphin- no pay motto(apparently) and I said should we pay you today or on Saturday? he then said no you pay 8000 today and 8000 Saturday!! I was shocked and started to explain how we didn't see the Dolphins or swim etc and he then got quite intimidating. Stupidly I handed over the money we ""owed"" for that day and he walked off. I spoke to the hotel who was very helpful but explained that he is registered with the local council and there is not much they can do . Please if you want to see the Dolphins book through the hotel!!!Today the hotel offered me and my partner free of charge to go on the boat with another couple for the inconvenience; which they didn't have to do at all! Just shows how dedicated this hotel is with making the holiday the best it can be ; even if I made the mistake!!!"
Swim around,a very clean beach to take a swim and that too not very crowded..peace loving people who want to say out of crowd then this is a place to be.
Beautiful beach,Also very interesting snorkeling. Not the best but give it 45 mins or so and you will appreciate it. 100 percent worth a visit and a sun bath :) Enjoy .
mesmerising,one of the most mesmerising beaches in Mauritius.. nice white sand beach .. windy though and perfect if you like kite surfing .. there are few schools around for kitesurfing... we went in the evening and had a great sunset view .. swimming is bit dangerously ..
Mauritius is the best place.,"Mauritius is the best place I have ever been before. Incredible beaches and nature in general and such wonderful parks made me love this place so hard. All the people were really amiable. Also, I want to make a good point and to say how I appreciated the great organization of my vocation made up by elite voyage team. This journey wasn‚Äôt cheap but worth every cent."
Massive Construction Developments at Le Morne Beach,"We visited Le Morne Beach on an overcast day but it was still beautiful.However, because it's located on the south-western side of Mauritius, it is exposed to winds.Compared to the beaches of the north and north-east of the country, it is not as protected or as spectacular.At the time we visited, in February 2015, there was massive construction development along Le Morne Beach. It was quite incredible to see hundreds of people frantically working to complete a number of up-market resorts."
Beautiful but dangerous,"The beach in this area looked beautiful, as you might expect.  The sea is a lovely turquoise colour and the sand, whilst slightly gritty, is golden and very clean.  There are, as you would also expect, palm trees to add to the tropical feel.  However, it is not easy to swim there.  We travelled in July, which is winter in Mauritius, so it may have been that it was a bit cold and rough because of the time of year.  However, there was often a red flag flying due to strong currents, there are lots of coral that you have to be careful not to step on and there are also dozens and dozens of kite and windsurfers in the area.  Sugar beach in the north is much better."
Lovely day trip,I liked the drive around Le Morne I think is one of the prettier parts of Mauritius. The Beach was lovely and clean. There is a memorial across the road from the beach with the big black and gold gates. Take a drive around the other side where all the kite surfers are and you can drive all the way around the bottom of the big hill. We drove from Flic n flec sown to Le Morne then up to Charamel falls and the seven coloured earths then back down to Rochester falls then on to Gris Gris back through Curepipe and back across to Flic n flac. It was a lovely  day trip. Caution not all the fuel stations are open on a Sunday so make sure your fueled up.
Beautiful,"This was a beautiful beach, on a stop on a trip I took with my parents in November 2014, the sea was a beautiful blue, the sand was soft between my toes. x"
Fantastic Beach with Amazing Speed Boat Trip.....,"Whilst your lying on the beach lapping up the sun, listen to Carlos the Boat Man selling his speed boat tours! We were apprehensive at first as when your sun bathing last thing you want is an interruption. However, this man sells the most fantastic speed boat trip and at a lot cheaper price than the hotel. After looking through the fantastic photos from the trip we booked it. We got picked up at 8am and it was like being on a private boat, just 7 of us from the hotel, whom we had alraedy made friends with. We jetted off on the boat, the waters were slightly choppy, but it was enjoyable. Once we got past that, saw dolphins swimming in the wild, saw lots of fantastic sites, then saw some lovely monkeys in the wild and a waterful. We then headed to the most beautiful island called Iie aux Benitiers for a fantastic bbq lunch with all you can drink including fresh lobster, amazing! After lunch locals singing and dancing for you which was also superb! We even joined in dancing as we loved it so much! You then head back for a relaxing trip along the ocean and stop for snokelling in shallow water with lots of fish. What a wonderful day out :-), couldn't recommend any more highly, but be prepared for the camping style toilet on the island! :-)"
quiet,serene and clean beach. white sand but not fine to walk on. mostly attached to the respective hotels. Kite surfing at one end of the beach.
Kite boarding in Mauritius,The kite boarding mecca of Mauritius. Most days have very favorable winds allowing speed and stunt boarding. It can however become a little over crowded requiring relocation around the bay.
Gorgeous beach,"Le Morne beach is one of the best beaches in Mauritius.  You have access to plenty of shade, a little restaurant called Emba Filao, and toilets (if you're a paying customer at the restaurant!)  Protect your feet in Mauritius--we do have stone fish, especially in the hotter months.  Paddle or swim out for unbelievable views back to the beach and on to Le Morne Mountain (with an incredible, but sad history)."
Pretty nice sandy beach,"Pretty nice sandy beach with a bit uncomfortable limestone stripe along its major part. Completely unexpected was that no one was entering the water. Just few young Italians were taking photos of sea urchins and starfishes at a knee depth. More widely - all beaches and hotels at Mauritius at mid June give impression of death of tourism at the island. As indirect proof of such sad conclusion may be considered absolutely heavenly clients' treatment (Dinarobin Hotel & SPA, Le Morne)- waterfall of free of charge extras: lunch free of charge, late check out, boarding passes right to your room, free snorkeling trips, amazing parade of old-timers at the entrance area etc."
Amazing spot,"This beach is found after hotels and is just incredible. With a view on Le Morne Brabant, it offers the perfect spot for people looking for a really quiet place to spend some time. Besides, it is also where you can find and learn kite surf."
Beach and Mountain,Lovely white sand beach with clear water. A lot of boats in the area.  Very pretty with the huge mountain behind you.
A beach as a beach should be,Like: white pristine beach and really blue waters and very cleanDislike: beach is a bit narrow but very long and some parts are less narrow
Beautiful beach with an a beautiful landscape,"The water is so clean and transparent that you are able to see all those fishes swimming in the ocean. That was a must, be seated in the water line look front you can see the beautiful blue ocean and if you look back you can see that Le Morne rock that is amazing! Truly beautiful spot!"
"beautiful beach, doesn't appear to get as busy as others at weekends.","We visited this beach twice during our stay.  We pitched up on the beach in the vicinity of the cafe/drinks/showers/toilets.  A beautiful stretch of beach.  The amenities were good.  Toilets clean throughout the day.  Showers to rinse off after a day at the beach.  We ate dinner her on both occasions.  The food on offer is reasonably priced - today we had burger/chips, special fried rice with chicken/prawns & prawns/salad/chips with three drinks - around ¬£16 total.  There are boats & canoes I think for hire but we didn't bother so can't comment on price but they were well used.  We also regularly saw people horse riding down the beach - think there is a place you can do this near by."
"Dream Team 2 boat excursion, a must!","very comfortable and clean boat, excellent captain and guide, amazing swim with wild dolphins, snorkeling etc.top security and very profesional, so perfect for us and daughter of 12 and grandma as well!!"
Lovely Historical Beach,"So there is a very sad and poignant legend about this beach, as it is at the foothills of the Le Morne mountain which is where a lot of slaves committed suicide it is said to escape the slavery. There is a small memorial at the base, and the beach is of course a public beach where you can take a picnic and spend the day."
Picturesque drive to one of the best beaches,The drive to Le Morne is rather pretty with all the mountains and sugarcane fields and gives you something to keep calm given the windy roads and Mauritian drivers!!! Le Morne is an absolutely gorgeous beach with beautiful water and few corals to cut your feet open!!!
UNESCO,We were here to experience the UNESCO sights as listed in Mauritius. Nice stopover as a tourist attraction.
Excellent!,Le Morne Beach is an amazing spot to just chill with a book or do something fun & adventurous like wake up very early morning to swim next to Dolphins in the beautiful Indian Ocean.
best public beach,"Le Morne 1 (after Dinarobin resort coming from North) is in my opinion the best public beach I have been to in Mauritius. Water is clear and green, the reef is quite near and there are not to many boats buzzing around. Mont Brabant dominates the beach in a spectacular way.Forget about spectaculous snorkelling, which in reality I still didn't find in Mauritius.Cars have a parking and cannot reach the beach, so you don't have to put your towel between a chinese and a japanese hired car.Trees guarantee a good shadow and a first shelter for the unwanted showers.Sadly, as it happens in many other places in Mauritius, very long stretches of sand have been ""privatised"" to luxury resorts. Even worse (in my humble opinion), these resorts built golf  courses that occupy enormous amounts of land right next to the beaches. As a mauritian, which I am not, this would really upset me. Nothing against luxury, but I find it really invasive this way. Moreover, the beaches of these 300 stars resorts are almost always empty, as luxury turists I believe like drinking Margaritas at the swimming pool. All these said, I believe that Le Morne 1 is very nice. I didn't love so much Le Morne 2, at the south-west edge of Le Morne peninsula. Cars there are parked almost in tne water"
Nice Beach for a short stop,"We stopped at Morne Beach for snorkeling, but we haven't been satisfied. maybe we were snorkeling on the wrong place, because we have seen just dead corals. Nice Beach for an hour or two."
Lux Le Morne,I need to make a correction to my review on the Lux Le Morne Mauritius.The name of the extremely helpful guest relations manager was VINAY and not VIJAY as printed in my review.
Paradise on Earth,"Le Morne is to me one of those places that deserve to be called paradise. It is breathtaking, Stay there to see the sunset, there are no word to describe it. It is so peaceful, beautiful, calm, relaxing. It needs to be seen!"
Kite surfing area,Visited this windy southern area which is paradise of kite surfersThe sand is nice and white and the sea crystal blue
Beautiful beach beautiful Maritius,"We went onto the public beach at Le Morne  beautiful white sand  and good facilities  (toilets) the small beach further up was brilliant for kitesurfing very very windy fun to watch the people flying and surfing, although not a good place if you want to just relax. The local hawkers can be troublesome but act a bit thick and say you don't understand they go away.  The backdrop of the Le Morne mountain is fabulous walk out into the water and  take some great photos. The locals come out in force at the weekend which adds to the whole experience very friendly people fantastic music and great atmosphere."
Visit in October for clear skies & gentle winds,"We were told the above by a thoroughbred Mauritian kitesurfing teacher. Spent a week here in August. Managed to kite 4 days only. With poor wind & rain on the other 3. Stayed at St Regis. Relied on taxi to send us and kiting gear to Le Morne Beginner's Bay, 200 rupees/ 7 USD, one way over 2km distance. Indian resort is nearer but is closed for renovation. The bay is wide, choked full with beginners & teachers. Can kite well without interruption upwind & away from crowd. Picturesque setting. Lessons with one of many independent kite school operating from minivans are cheaper but good, at 100USD for 2 hours."
One of the best beaches in the world,"I've been lucky to travel widely and have seen many lovely beaches from Australia to the Caribbean.  This one takes your breath away.  You can walk half a mile into the ocean in clear beautiful water, the beach is never busy but the view backwards at the shoreline when you are in the water of mount Le Brabant is the most amazing backdrop.  Don't go to Mauritius without seeing the south coast and the particularly the south west.  It is stunning.  Fantastic sunsets."
Beautiful Tropical beach under the watchful eye of Le Morne Mountain,"Le Morne combines a palm fringed, white sandy beach with  offshore coral and the looming beauty of the nearby mountain. Snorkel a few meters into the sea with countless fish. Although there a a number of high end resorts along the beach, a few public beaches ensure effective access along the stretch. Public beaches have toilets and shade. When you are bored with sunbathing you can watch kite surfers do their thing at the far end of the beach.  Very busy during weekends with happy locals enjoying a party vibe. Have this UNESCO listed area to yourself during the week."
STUNNING! ,"A fantastic beach with the best view of Le Morne mountain. The water is crystal clear. The only thing that didn't make it perfect was the vast amount of coral mixed with the sand, but that's nature for you!"
Best beach on the island,This is one among the best beaches on the island. Its the perfect place if you want to spend with friends or family. Its calm clear lagoon is perfect for swimming.
Gorgeous quiet beach with Le Morne Brabant as your view,The beach here is perfect if you want a get away from it all quiet experience. With the large Le morne mountain as a backdrop and beautiful clear water that us calm enough to swim in its a joy. Don't expect restaurants and bars - there's one at the end of the beach which is great but otherwise it's just paradise beach
Beautiful beach,Beautiful beach with good snack bar. There is a strong side current which you need to be careful of if you are not a good swimmer. No problem if you stay close to the shore
Le Morne Beach Mauritius,This is a very beautiful beach in the south west coast of Mauritius. The public beaches are nice to spend time with family and good for swimming.
"BEST LAGOON AND BEACH OF MAURITIUS, DUE TO MAJESTIC LE MORNE MOUNTAIN LOCATION ALSO !","I have stayed several times for my holidays around Le Morne Beach, staying in Le Paradis Hotel & Golf Club, in Dinarobin, in Les Pavillons (now renamed Lux Resort) and I can definitively say that the best part of this beach is located on Le Paradis Hotel & Golf Club side. Why ? Because you are closer to coconut rock (incredible rock on the lagoon), because you don't get shadow from Le Morne mounatain (not as it happens in Dinarobin), because you can easily fish in the lagoon with local fishermen and because it is less windy than on the side of Lux Resort and St-R√©gis Hotel. You will also see that a lot of rocks/black corails are lying in front of the beach at Dinarobin, it is really not the best place to swim, but from Le Paradis Hotel, all is perfect !I will soon post some photos of this long beautiful beach, for you to see what I'm talking about.So, enjoy and meet you there one day ;-)."
Great beach,"Nice, long, clean and very white beach with a slow slope into the ocean. Good restaurants, especially at the Lux-resort!"
Best kitesurfing beach ever,"Great place for kitesurfing. Also if you take family who dont surf, there is a public beach next to Lux hotel that is sheltered from the wind and has a great eatery with fresh fish where you can leave your kids/wife for the day. Best to have a car to move around. Also i stayed in a flat 8 min away in La Gullete village where there are a few surfing bars/shops.My advice is to get in touch with one of the kitesurfing schools and ask them to suggest a flat and car rental....i got mine for euro 50 per day for both and was very happy with the standard."
Everything you are looking for...,"I loved the beach of Le Morne - the waters were so clean and blue, the snorkeling was great, I loved seeing all of the tropical fish and bright corals... however, minor forewarning, it is winter in Mauritius in August so the waters were brisk which felt quite refreshing but after awhile I was freezing!  Also, bring sand shoes as the beaches have a lot of coral and can really hurt your feet!"
west almost good weather always. too much windy for some people but good wind for others.,Really good beach. Recommended to visit ...... weekdays better than weekends WC praticable.....the hotels around provide you indirect security so you can stay till late.
Near to perfect as it gets,"The travel brochures show a perfect white sand beach and it is just that! Swim, walk and just enjoy."
So beautiful!,"This beach is rightly considered one of the most beautiful on the island. Beside the private stretches of beach occupied by the resorts there are quite a few bits of free each. On the beach you can practice lots of sports, specially diving is recommended as in certain periods of the year the pass of fishes is excellent right around the reef. Beside the restaurants of the resort there are quite a few good spots for a tasty lunch."
Lashings of wind and rain,"Le Morne Beach is in a peninsula where the weather conditions favour surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing. It has the right type of water breaks and windy conditions. Public beach access is available but the best spots are through hotel grounds.On my day of visit the wind and rain was lashing down on Le Morne beach, me and my camera definitely felt the force of the rain! The sea was rough but there were still a few hardy wind surfers out there.On a later visit I saw the beach in better condition from a speedboat trip."
great beach,it is very pitoresque! Most of it is in hotel property so securit guards will chase you off long chairs if you dont stay at the hotels. But there are several sections that are public. at the very end close to the Club mistral you can go kite ( or normal) surfing. The Le morne brabant is also adding to the beauty of the beach!
Looks gorgeous but no swimming,"Le Morne Beach is very pretty, reminded us a bit of Heron Island on the great barrier reef in places. However, the only part you can safely swim is on the posh hotel's bit and they have buoys close to the shore so no good for snorkelling. Worth a stop for photos if you are in the area."
Le Morne beach and surroundings,It's an imressive beach embedded in a beautifula landscape but the public beach is reduced to a minimum. Best beach access have guests staying at the St. Regis Resort and Paradise Hotel.
The most beautiful beach in Mauritius.,"This is definitely the most beautiful beach on the island. Relatively far for tourists without a rented car, and relatively far for native people also. So the beach is almost like private, there is a bunch of highly rated hotel complexes, but the visitors stick to the swimming pools in those hotels, so you can enjoy the beach just for you. Perfect, perfect, perfect...a must try beach when in Mauritius."
Public/private,"Just remember that whilst all beaches in Mauritius are public, the fancy resort hotels employ sucurity guards to keep you off their part, so check to see where you can get access (fairly obvious) and don't think of putting your towel down in the less public parts! The swimming is good, by the way!"
Kitespot,"Very good kitespot, for beginners and advanced kiters. beautyfull resorts and familyhouses for rent. Nice people and good fish."
Kite surfing!,"nice place, though a little dangerous for inexperienced kite surfers, around the corner is a great lagoon for the beginners, but no beach worth speaking of.  All the good cheap beach eats are on the trunks around the kite/wind surfer spots."
My favourite beach on the Island,"The beaches on the SW end of the Island are my favourite - deep enough for swimming, secluded, scenic and not as crowded (kind of more exclusive) as those on the east or north coast -either with fellow tourist or with local trades people.Lots of fun sea activities can be paid for at the Le Morne, Les Pavillons Hotel. BTW, the hotel restaurant is fabulous.Public toilet is crap though - although there are cleaners on hand, but it is very poor."
Lovely public beach,"We stopped here when visiting the west, hawkers playing the drums and singing lovely atmosphere! Worth stopping for an hour"
Great place,"Visited as part of a speedboat tour from the Sands Hotel.Lovely clear watewr in the laoon, fantastic snorkelling"
Nice beach,"Great beach, clean clear water, white sand and  lots of shade. Busy on the weekends."
La Morne Beach,"Beautiful clean white beach, sea clean blue water very pretty. Lovely place to picnic"
"Le Morne Beach, Mauritius","Le Morne Beach is a fantastic beach in the southwest coast of Mauritius. We could say that this beach has two parts, the windward side, in the left, where is the best spot in the world for kitesurfing in waves (it is my second trip there) and the leeward, in the right, where the water is like crystal.In the windward side, if you are not kitesurfer o windsurfer, you will be a little bit uncomfortable du to the wind, despite the beauty of the place...In the other side, leeward, the temperature of the wind is 5 degrees higher because the absence of humidity and the water is calm without waves, perfect to swim and relax in the sand watching the fantastic sunset in this point of the island.Remember, it is a windy spot but only in the left side."
Great Sunset,"its a has a great public beach, the sand is soft, there is a great large extent of clean water where you can bath, an ideal place to spend the whole day and do not miss the sunset out there, its Fabulous! and very very romantic."
