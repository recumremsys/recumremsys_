Karla caves and temple,"Karla caves is one of the most popular place to visit, if you go to Lonavala. Karla caves also have temple of goddess Durga. It's is Also one of the most visited temple in Maharashtra, during Navratri. Temple can be visiting through train or by road."
Ajanta,"A trip to Ajanta is a journey into the beautiful ancient world of caves, with amazing frescoes, beautiful sculptures and amazing history! This is a dream trip!"
Karla Caves visit,"These are near Malavli railway station, District Pune. The main cave with the stupa has wooden rafters on its ceiling. There is Ekvira Temple at the entrance of one of the caves. The steps leading to the caves are lined with shops on either side. There are lot of visitors to the temple situated here."
Karla caves,One must visit this heritage place and will enjoy the place very well.The kids below 10 may not like but for history we must visit.
Great climb to exceptional carved caves,"We were in Lonavala and wanted to head to the Karla caves.  Being adventurous, we took an auto rickshaw (the most modern we could find) and roared up to the caves.  The ride up was half the fun of the trip to the caves.  It is worth doing if fit as there are some 200 plus steps up and down.  There are places to stop for food and drink on the way and also many stores with religious bits and pieces.  The caves are stunning.  The whole temple is carved from the hill side.  Worth a visit."
Two points at one place,"At Karla caves, there are two points one is caves itself and another is Maa Elvira Temple. Caves entry closing time is 5 pm. There are about 150 stairs to reach at the caves and the temple. Enjoyed Sunset at the Karla hill."
Crowded caves,We went here after Bhaja caves (10km away) and these were far busier! So many people around and a long line to get into Ekvira temple. Foreigners have to pay 300 rupee and be prepared to be approached to get photos with the locals!!
Religious trip,Karla caves a good location for architecture students close to Mumbai and Pune plus visit to Ekvira mata temple
Karla Cave Is Most Crowded Than Bhaja & Bedse Caves,"Karla cave attracts large crowd on account of Ekvira Devi temple beside the cave. Otherwise Bhaja & Bedse caves are maintained well & also looks much more better than Karla caves.Date of visit: 9th Nov. 2019A) Route from Pune BibvewadiOld Pune Mumbai Road till Bhaja Karla JunctionAt Bhaja Karla junction you will see signboard arch of Ekvira Devi on your right.Take right turn & proceed straight to Karla cave. Other landmarks at Bhaja Karla junction are:Left side: Sarthak Snacks Center & Hotel  Ekvira Snacks CenterRight side: Hotel Karla GateTip: At Bhaja Karla Junctioni) Left side road leads to Bhaja caveii) Right side road leads to Karla caveB) Distancei) Pune Bibvewadi to Bhaja Karla Junction - 67 kmii) Bhaja Karla Junction to Karla Cave Parking - 3 kmC) Road Toll after Dehu:Rs.70 for one way & Rs.105 for two way.D) Parking:Prior to entering Karla cave hill, a toll post is there collecting Rs.30 for car in the name of Gram Panchayat tax. Those who stop, end up paying & those who don't stop becomes lucky. We stopped & we ended up paying. Since we stopped our car the other cars took advantage & drove fast to become lucky. i) There is parking at the ground level Park your car here if you are visiting on Saturday or Sunday or Festival day because this place attracts enormous crowed.From here it is long trek of more than 30 minutes till starting of steps. Autos are there taking Rs.40 per person.ii) At mid level on hillFrom this point it takes 15 to 20 minutes till starting of steps. iii) At the starting point of the trek to Karla caveEven though it was Saturday, it took us lot of efforts to get thru traffic jam & parking space availability at this place. Rs.10 for car park.From this place it takes 10 to 15 minutes walk thru steps to reach the Karla cavesE) Trek RouteOn both side of trek route there are shops, restaurants, snacks juice center as well as garland & flower stall.Because of these things there are shelter thru out the trek route to avoid sun & rain. Shelter in the form of plastic tarpaulin blocks the views from the trek route.F) Karla Cave & Ekvira Devi TempleEkvira Devi belongs to Koli (Fisherman) community so one will find Koli music & visitors doing Koli dance in front of the temple or main cave.It is the most crowded & noisy place.From cave one can see scenic views in front.G) Timings for cave: Early morning to mid night or 24 hours during festival H) Entry FeeWe didn't saw any counter to collect entry ticket at this cave during our visitI) Best Time To Visit:i) Rainy & Monsoon Seasonii) On any weekdays other than Saturday, Sunday or Festival day.NB: On Saturday, Sunday & Festival days, it attracts enormous crowd.Don't try to drive your car to the topmost parking point on these days because it is very narrow road on the hill for two cars to pass each other & our people are great in following unethical driving practices to create unwanted traffic jam chaos on road.J) Photos:Photos can be taken freely without any restriction.K) Recommendation:I will recommend readers to choose:a) Karla cave from religious point of view. I am unimpressed with this cave.b) Bedse caves from calm serene peaceful & scenic point of view. Impressive cave. 3) Bhaja caves from best scenic point of view. I am impressed.L) We had done one day trip in following sequence:1. Gaatha Mandir at Dehu2. Shirdi Saibaba at Shirgaon3. Bhaja Cave4. Karla Cave5. Tiger Point at Lonavala6. Lonavala Lake7. Bhooshi Dam at Lonavala8. Rajmachi Garden at Khandala9. Sunset Point at KhandalaHope the above information will enable you to plan your trip in best way."
Nice Ancient caves with Hindu pilgrimage ,"I will try to review it honestly. Pros : The caves are serene experience altoghether . I wonder how the rocks could be carved to such finest details . I felt very peaceful  and calm . Wikipedia has all details about it and you may want to read before visiting ASI ( govt body) has taken efforts to keep it clean inside caves and guards are very helpful . Costs 25 rs for indian and 300 rs for forgein national Temple nearby ( at chityagruha entrance)  is fishermans beloved goddess and I felt blessed There are many rituals to be  seen en route to temple Local people and other visitors are very friendly . My native is costal district of maharashtra and i know fishermen community well Cons : I am sorry but disappointed with plastic mess around base and en route Needs better litter mangementI heard loud music at base village and parties No proper management for parking It is choas if you go over weekend Police and locals try best however we desi people need lane discipline and patience , i mean it !!!I felt this ancient place is overtaken and needs better overall makeover This is afterall 2000 year old history and what we are  gone keep for our kids and next generations ? I experienced USA preserved even 300 year old history with such pride and dignity Tip- Avoid weekends or Hindu festivals time upper level parking gets full early, try base parking and walk more Try auto rikshaw from where you turn to Ekvira temple road from old mumbai pune highway If you are not indian , i would say you visit during weekday and when no festival or public holiday round the corner ( that too early morning to beat rush ) Elderly and kids below 4 may need help to climp up around 350 odd steps"
Very badly maintained,Dark & slippery steps very dirty not worth visiting  I was given to understand ASI is maintains it whwhere does the  ticket money goes sorry ASI
Wonderful architecture,"The cave was built around 120 AD, therefore, interesting to see the sculpture of those times. Has a climb of around 250 steps, which can be fun if you are physically active and a pain otherwise. Go there if these two are of interest to you. Also, the cave has just one hall where you can see the exquisite sculpture."
What a climb,Going to see 2000 year old caves was exciting prospect but we underestimated the climb a little. There is a road that takes you halfway up the climb so you can go by car to that point but if you go when there are lot of people then the police may not allow. We happened to go during Navratri and since there is Ekvira devi temple next to the caves there were lots of people. But since we had a senior citizen with us they allowed our car to the halfway point. The climb from that point is quite steep. But there are shops on the way to take your mind off to climb. Once you reach the top you are amazed by the structure. Nominal ticket price. Though the structure is beautiful it hasn't been maintained well. People have vandalized it over the centuries. But the peace you find is astounding. Though it was warm outside the caves were cool.Since it was Navratri time there was a lot of rush for the temple hence we couldn't go inside. So next time temple for sure.
Very Less to see these days,"Karla Caves are nowadays have nothing to see, The cave is closed, the water in waterfall is very less, only the temple is holding this place together, First I had visited Karla Caves in 2013. Back then the cave was open, Waterfall was very big, the mountains are open, free to roam, but now everything came to halt due to some accidents.Reaching Karla caves is very tough, you have to climb many stairs if you don't want much physical activity, take an auto reach halfway, then from there start climbing.This place is a holy place for KOLI People who are basically Fishermen."
A good physical visit,A climb to the top is refreshing. Many places to eat on the way and at the bottom. The caves are beautiful! You have to visit If in Lonavla.
Awesome place to visit!!!,"Awesome place to visit. Specially those people who love historical places. The Architecture of this cave is mind blowing.. just you can notice one point is the way natural light entered in to the cave.. just superb planning. Must visit for adventure lovers, history lovers and for archeology students there is lot to learn... good luck and must visit place for sure."
Ancient caves must visit,"Karla is a village about 11km from Lonavala station, 2km off Old Pune-Mumbai highway and rickshaws or cabs will take you there. Caves are located on hilltop and your vehicle can arrive either at base of the hill or the upper parking. From base it is a climb of 350 stony steps, or about 150 steps from upper parking. Better to start from base if you want to enjoy the views, water streams, and the climb itself. My yound kids also were able to make the climb easily. Try to start climb early, by 9am or so, to avoid crowds. Wear good grip footwear and be prepared to walk through water streams at some steps. There are lot of vendor shops along upper steps selling offerings for the Ekvira temple, and also snacks. Keep in mind most visitors are not coming to visit the caves, rather are devotees going to temple which is right in front of the main cave. They are mostly from fishermen community. When you reach the top there is a ticket office for cave entry, pay Rs25 per adult, kids go free. Adjacent the caves there's a beautiful water fall (alive atleast during monsoon). Then there are rock cut hermitages. And then the main cave itself dedicated to Lord Buddha, the stupa inside is believed to contain some ashes of Buddha's own remains. The security guard will double up as guide if you wish, for a small tip. Getting guidance is highly recommended, else one won't make much sense of the visit, will just click some pics and return without getting to know much. Carvings are brilliant, so is the remaining Ashoka pillar. The other pillar had to go as the Ekvira temple was built in its place. It's sad to see goat/chicken sacrifices are made in the temple built right in front of the caves which have carvings of Lord Buddha and Lord Mahavir, who were some of the biggest proponents of nonviolence. Believed to be constructed by Pandavas (but in reality built much after the caves were built), the temple appears to be uncharacteristic of this originally Buddhist site. The caves though, fortunately are now managed and protected by ASI. It's a must visit for tourists going to Lonavala. It's little distant from other popular spots like Khandala, bhushi dam or Lions point etc, but certainly worth a visit. The climb, visit and descent altogether can take 2 to 2.5 hours."
"Karla Caves-often missed out place, but worth Visit.","Ancient buddhist Cave ,next to Ekvira temple on a hil top. The road is motorable and there is parking lot. Some 250 steps from there. you can spend 1-1.5 hrs easily and enjoy the sculpting done."
Good place,Karla caves had beautiful work done on the walls but only issue I found is that the tempo Traveller can not go to the parking place so we had to walk so much which was difficult as we had people around 55 years also.moreover on reaching there was only one cave which was worth seeing that too a very small passage.the other side had nothing to see. Their is a temple alongside where locals come to seek blessings in large numbers.
Amazing cave architecture,The main hall in the Karla caves is very impressive. The cave is huge with impressive pillars along the length of the cave. It was worth climbing the 750 steps to reach the cave.Word of caution.People park their cars on both sides of the road leading to the caves making the journey irritating and time consuming. The tourism department should take strict action against vehicles doing double parking.
Pretty normal caves,"I don’t call it caves, it is more of a Buddhist sculptures and a big round sthupa . It can be watched once as there is nothing much to do in Lonavala. You can also skip if short on time. All the best"
Karla caves,Me and my friend from Austria had been to this place was disappointed with the lady in the ticket counter me being an indian citizen she charged me 600bucks which was a foriegn citizen price when I said I am indian I can show my I’d proof she said she will refund when we get back as we were done watching the caves she said she cannot refund the tickets me being an indian felt shamed infront of my foreign friend who had come to see India she is an indian girl lier sitting in front of the holy temple with no respect to the guest .
rustic spiritual experience,The way up to the caves is steep but lined with little shops. All worth it at the top ! Caves are just the one but what a terrific cave it is !! Like a hallway of kings form a long long time ago. The temple itself is not a must but go if you want to partake of the rustic adulation and ritual of the fisherfolk who go there to appease the goddess. We saw a goat being taken up with a bunch of villagers who were to sacrifice it after showing her to the goddess. Tourists are mere onlookers on a very alive ritualistic place. Felt very rejuvenated.
Interesting caves and temples made 2500 years ago,"These are on the lines of Ajanta. But far crude. There is no guide, or any written material about these attraction.They are also dirty. They look quite good, but if one wants to explore them, that cannot be done. Even a guided path is not available."
Majestic views of Lonavala,"Situated on old Mumbai Pune Highway, these Caves are a nice stopover and a religious abode. Housing the Ekvira devi temple, this hill has proper stairs lined with lots of shops selling various Pooja सामग्री and sweets. The stairs have handrails for support so the elderly devotees can make it to the top as well.In rains you can see a beautiful waterfall right as you reach the top. Caves have Buddhist history andcan be visted at a fee of 25 Rs. The birds eye view of the city is another attraction."
Worth seeing,The place is really worth seeing for its historical value. The steep height is a bit detterant but once u get in the flow it is really easy to acess. There is also a temple there AKVIRA mata mandir and due to that there is lot of traffic.
Karla Caves Visit,"I'm sad to give this review. This is were our Devi is and as a family we visit this location for blessings. I was deeply saddened to see the plight of the place. Plastic all over, right from the foothill all the way into the temple. People were a havoc as there was loud non-religious music which is unlikely in a religious place adding to the Noise pollution. The caves are 3 layered and absolutely stunning but the beauty and heritage is deeply destroyed by the people who visit. I saw some tourists as well who were very keen on the caves but I could see and feel their disappointment."
Adventurous Place ,This place looks ordinary from outside but a kind of hidden gem having a little tough track to reach. I have seen foreigners visiting this place and enjoying the ancient architecture.
Heritage,People who love to explore must visit. These are old caves. Linked with buddhist monks. Exact description as we use to find in history books. I really loved visiting it.
An awesome experience ,I went there to explore the place and it was really one of the best places i have ever seen. This place has its own beauty and you should cone to visit this place 👌🏻
Bad smell of blood on stairs,"Carla caves is Buddhist caves was in use by Buddhist Monks for dhyan and studying Buddhism.Caves is accompanied by Ekvira Devi Temple, the Kuldevi or Goddess of Koli & Agri community of Maharashtra. The only worse thing here is that worshipers sacrifice goats and Chickens openly near stairs going to Caves."
let us see the caves build by the old generations,One who have intrest in history must visit these caves and overall view is good but look poorly maintained by the authorities
Ancient Buddhist Caves ,It's a historic place which can be good tourist attraction if taken proper care by the people in charge. This place needs to be maintained well.
Beautiful but can do we better maintenance ,Beautiful caves situated in lonavla. Picturesque landscape. Pleasure to visit during the rainy season. Can do with better maintenance
Buddhist caves,"After a hike of about 200 steps, we reach the caves.There are many caves of Buddhist origin built by Emperor Ashok.They were the centres of meditation.A temple is located besides the caves which is a very sacred place for the locals."
Tiring yet adventurous,We visited Karla caves with faMiky in March 2019 and we didn't know it is on top of a small.mountain and has 60 steps to climb..we had a small baby and we got too tired when we reached the caves. There are lot of shops on the way to caves that makes the ascend easier.we had a great trip and adventure
A divine place,Next to karla caves is aai ekvira temple. It's our community...CKP kuladaivat means community goddess. It's a divine place and you get total peace of mind here and goddess ekvira's blessings will be with you throughout the life. Must visit place.
Buddhist caves taken over by an Hindu Iconic temple,Extremely well defined and articulated icon of Buddhism. The climb is exhilarating but juxtaposed by Hindu religious pilgrims visiting a temple bang in front of the caves. The paradox is are you visiting an archeological site or a piligramage
Travel down to the days of Jain Monks,Visit the caves to understand why the monks built such structures and how they lived up the mountains.
Great visit 👍,The karla caves are quite similar topographically to the Ajanta caves. Marvellous piece of wonder. There are stone carvings of gods and goddesses and various sculptures inside the caves. You would love this place if you’re a first timer like myself.
Beautiful caves,It's a really beautiful ancient cave that we have in Lonavala there is also a small Temple located there. You will have to climb to reach the cave because there is no other means to reach
Ancient rock cave,It was great place for weekend hangout. Best time to visit this place was monsoon. Vehicle parking was not good. If you love historical place then this is great place for visit.
Great example of natural excellence,"The rock-cut structures in several parts of India are one of the most primitive architecture forms. One such type of structures is the Karla Caves. These caves in Maharashtra were built by Buddhist monks, one of the finest architectural examples. These caves are engulfed with the hills that run up along a narrow and winding path. These were also one of the main trade routes of the caravan. These caves are a great example of natural excellence. The monks built the cave shrine here are considered as one of the best places."
Fantastic Experience ,"Total thumbs up for these caves! They were fantastic to see, located about a 20 minute drive from Lonavla’s Main Street.They are located towards the top of the hill, around 150-200 steps up from the car park, along the steps are stalls selling everything from footwear to water, dependant on your needs.The steps are uneven on the way up, so watch your footing, I slipped and broke my shoe on the way up, but managed to buy another pair on the way back down!The caves themselves are very impressive and amazingly well preserved given their age, there is also a temple next door to them.We would very much recommend a visit!"
Awesome rock cut caves,"Karla  Caves was the first  stop in our Lonavala trip and was so worth it ! There are a lot of steps to climb to reach the top  which takes some time and effort.  When we went ,there was some festival happening there and lot of local crowd had come .On the top  , there is some local temple near the cave entrance and there was long queue to get in . But the cave itself is a historic site and can be entered easily (no queue n all ) .   Coming to the actual caves , these are 6-7 th  century Budhist rock cut caves with one impressive central hall , and many nearby viharas . I felt the lack of proper trained ASI guides to give more info about the site .Authorities should take better care of this amazing site.  Must visit if you are into ancient Indian history.25 RS per head entry fee."
Nothing Much,"Just visit the site for mataji mandir, nothing much to see except if one is intrested in archeological exploration."
Peaceful place to visit,Visited today and place is good for 2 hours or short day trip ... after visiting here you can drive to Bhaja caves which are 15-20 mins drive.. there you can spend 1-2 hours... overall a good experience.
very Good place,very Good place . must visit. too many stairs but worth to visit.very Good place very Good place very Good place
Visit for Temple,This place is near Lonavala and is located on a height. You have to climb stairs to get to the top. It is a refreshing place with an ancient Ekvira Devi temple in the vicinity. The caves are not in a good condition and i don't think it is even worth 25 rs that you pay for admission. There is no sanitation or drinking water facility around. The toilets at the foothill near the parking area were stinking with no water in tap. Parking area is poorly maintained. Even the road leading to parking area is poorly maintained. This is when there is no dearth of money as Ekvira Devi temple gets ample donation from devotees.
Worth visiting ,"It is a must visit place close to Lonavala. It is nestled on a hilltop and there are quite a few steps to climb. It is a two in one purpose climb , also covering the holy shrine of Ekvira temple. The caves date to one century BC. They have been built by combined efforts of Buddhists and Jains. The architechture of the main hall is awesome. Do take a guide with you, if you want to understand the historical details, otherwise you will not understand anything. If you are fit to climb don’t miss it"
Good small hike,"It was a good visit, the only downer was that there is an adjoining temple nearby due to which there are lot of people crowding the walkway and parking issues too"
Caves with Temple,Karla caves is very good old site to visit along with temple over there. Caves are good and shows old time.
Another wonderful place,"66 kilometers from Pune is located Karla Cave. It dates from the 1st century BC. The magnificent chaytyagriha, the largest and best preserved of the early Buddhist caves in the Deccan. I would like to draw attention to the majestic sculptural courtyard, the facade with a height of 14 meters with a horseshoe-shaped window and an extensive column hall with a monolithic stupa."
Nice place,Must visit. Peaceful place. It's like the one day picnic. Should visit with friends. Will enjoy. Nice experience
Old and unique..,Karla caves is a very old type of caves in lonavala. It would be great if you can arrange and take him with you if you encounter one
A twin Treat Karla Caves and Parvati Temple,"A Short drive up the hill off the Old Pune Mumbai High way. Ample paid parking at the foot hill. The climb of 200 steps is peppered with small shops, eateries and for large parts shaded. Unlike the climb to Baja Caves. Top of the hill and you have the Parvati temple on one side and Karla Caves on the other. The temple revered by locals is normally very busy. But we managed a quick Darshan on a week day, past noon.Karla caves though similar to Baja are more impressive. The main prayer hall is very large with intricate carvings. A ideal place to rest and relax. The residence quarters ( or rooms) are cut into the caves , although no longer used.Set aside an Hour to visit the caves and temple"
Not bad,"You will definitely find the good sculptures,. But half of the cave is closed because of the security reasons. Govt. Should maintain the history related spots."
An excellent edifice of Buddhist Era sculptures,"A wonderful structure of massive rock carved sculptures in caves on a mountain. It takes less than half an hour climb from parking area on a tile paved narrow path. Amazingly beautiful carvings of more than life sized elephants, men & women etc. The main cave has one of the largest prayer hall with a series of columns with superb carvings on top. Other caves are small and a few are closed for entry. Ekvira Devi temple is adjoining to the main cave. This invaluable treasure could be preserved & maintained better. Reaching this place could be challenging in view of poor sign boards en route. A must visit monument."
"Karla caves,Ekviramata temple,Lonavala","It is a historical place located 8km away from lonavala. Good sculpture and religious temple of Ekvira Mata. Car Parking is available but little bit steep roads are there. Around 200 steps to be climbed up to reach caves after car parking. While climbing u can purchase buttermilk,sugarcane juice or lemon juice from local vendors. Overall good place to visit but not well maintained by ASI (eventhough they charge Rs. 25 entry fees/ person)"
Great Place. Meditation Hall is Superb and well maintained!,"These Buddhist caves are about 20 mins from main Lonavala Bazaar. Once you reach the main gate, you have to pay a small entrance fee and then the coming road leads you to top of the hill where the main parking is. Road is not very wide but can easily accommodate a sedan or an SUV. Though I would drive with caution in rainy season as it has some steep climbs. There is a small parking fee you have to pay and that is where the climb for the caves begin. It took us about 20-30 mins to climb to the top to see the caves. You have to pay separate if you want to take the video. This place is a great piece of architecture and is very well maintained considering how old it is. The main attraction here is a meditation hall and which is so grand that it reminded me of many scenes from Lord of the Rings trilogy! There is also a huge Ashok Stambh out side the main entrance to the meditation hall. The security guards can give you a guided tour for as little as 100 Rs. It took us about 25-35 mins to complete the tour including visit to Temple of Goddess Ekvira which is in the same premises.A very good place to visit if you are in Lonavala."
