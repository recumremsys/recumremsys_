A Walk In The Park ..... Literally,"Although it was a winter day and nothing was in bloom our visit was still an enjoyable experience.  There were lakes, ponds, creeks, waterfalls, stone walls, foot paths and an abundance of well manicured plant species in a well designed area.  We regret not having time to visit the former residence."
A Must Visit Location!,"We’ve seen many homes and gardens in Japan and Senganen was one of the most impressive. The house is not just historic it is gorgeous. The staff are helpful (some English spoken) and clearly proud to be working there. The gardens are really remarkable with ponds, small buildings, fountains and great walking areas. It’s March and there are lots of trees and flowers in bloom but it must be gorgeous most of the year. There’s a lot of English signage which is helpful along with young, enthusiastic staff. The shops are interesting with local traditional sweets along with beautiful crafts. We aren’t so fond of cut glass but the production here is a quite remarkable. Expensive and wonderful. We spent 3-4 hours wandering around and having lunch in the cafe - which was also quite good. Keep a watch for someone ordering one of the deserts with tea - the making of the tea is an interesting exhibition."
Beautiful gardens ,Huge garden with the residence houses facing the volcano in Sakurajima. Enjoyed the walk round the gardens n the great view of the volcano. There are also some shops selling souvenirs as well as some local snacks.
BEAUTIFUL GARDENS,"It is a park that consists of various gardens. You will enter through the commercial part however the further you go you will go along paths that will take you on a magical adventure, landscapes, exotic plants, lakes and rivers that cross everywhere. It is a relaxing experience, to enjoy some peace and the opportunity to take great pictures."
Gorgeous house and gardens,"Don’t miss Sengan-en if you are in the area. The gardens are stunning with beautiful views of the sea and volcano. The house has explanations in English and one can easily imagine the lives of the family that lived there. Plan to spend a few hours exploring. There are tasteful cafes, gift shops and a restaurant on site as well."
Very good place to visit,I visited Sengn-en in early December 2019. It was old buildings of Japanes style with good landscape environment. It provided a good location to view Sakurajima.
Beautiful insight to Japanese culture and history ,"The whole complex is lovely, but the house is the highlight! So beautifully preserved, authentic cedar house. It gives a great insight into Japanese history and culture."
Great view of Sakurajima,Overall an interesting place to visit because Sakurajima is part of the design. But I prefer the gardens of Kyoto and the wonderful Kanazawa one. The house is worth a visit.
good view of Sakurajimi,good view of Sakurajimi. nice short walk to enjoy the nature and the viw of Sakurajima. temple there and focus on cat but no cat there haha.
Beautiful gardens with view of Sakurajima,"We visited Sengan-en which has shrine, ponds, streams and cedars trees. There is an open ground where you can get a perfect picture of Kinko Bay and Sakurajima Inland in background. Must visit and see."
Great view of Sakurajima,Recommended if you like gardens. There's also a shopping area for food and souvenirs and some restaurants. We also bought the full priced ticket to visit the house as well and it was interesting.
Nice view,No need to buy ahead. Not a big savings. No crowds.Nice view and shopping area. Some renovation taking place.
Well maintained ,A more professionally managed attraction than most I saw in Kagoshima with plenty of ‘spending’ spots tactfully scattered along the ‘suggested route’ but then they can as they have plenty to shout about with the glass manufacturing and so on. The garden itself is stunning with some delightful shrines and plenty of explanatory signs. All that is missing for botanically minded tourists is plant/tree labels. Easy to get to as the tourist/city bus gets there but it does get very crowded.
Wonderful,Large garden that is well kept. Ample parking spaces. Like most Japanese gardens a lot of attention to detail. Good for an hour or two.
One of the very best,"This wonderfully complex garden built on the side of a mountain, overlooking the bay and the volcano is really special.  It is less formal than many of the other strolling gardens and has modern buildings housing cafes, restaurants and a variety of quality shops integrated into the garden.  We were quite surprised to find the well  preserved house with wonderful long corridors and rooms providing views of its own series of miniature gardens.  We rate it as one of the very best of the many Japanese gardens we've visited."
Highlight of the city ,"Kagoshima doesn't have a lot of big name attractions and what is listed as an attraction can turn out to be underwhelming. Sengan-en is probably the only attraction in the city that is worth a visit. It's slightly outside of the city area but not too far off-about 3km from Dolphin Port. I got on one of those hop on hop off sightseeing buses and it brought me there and back to Kagoshima Chuo station. The sengan-en garden is beautiful, and so is the home, against a backdrop of forested hills. From sengan en, you can see sakurajima and the view is breathtaking. The add-on ticket also allows you to visit the industrialisation museum next door. It's not a big deal but kinda wraps up the visit."
BEAUTIFUL!!!,It's lovely garden and house which is overwhelmingly beautiful. So well designed and maintained for few hundred years. The view of sakurajima is the best!!
 Beautiful Japanese gardens with head on ground level view of volcano,"Worth the visit.  A stop on the tourist bus or a $15 cab from hotel.  An hour walk is enough.  Mostly trees, bushes, water and views. Not a flower place."
Zen and nice tourist attraction,This is indeed a zen place to visit to feel the tranquility.  There is also a matcha cafe where matcha latte is served in a unique way. One can have a drink after walking around.
Nice view of Sakurajima. ,"If you only have time to visit either Sengan-en or Sakurajima, I would recommend visiting Sengan-en. It has a nice cozy collection of gardens, eateries, houses and shops. Walking paths are easy. Accessible from Kagoshima Chuo Station, through the Kagoshima city view bus. There is a pass for ¥600 a day. However, a one-way ticket is ¥190 for adults, so if you are just going to Sengan-en and back, it is better not to get a pass. A guidebook with bus timings are also available at the JR information counter next to the shops at Kagoshima chuo station.Admissions are split between the Garden+Museum, as well as Garden+Museum+House. We opted for the former. (Nice sweet potato soft serve ice cream near the entrance row of shops.)"
Beautiful Japanese Garden in Kagoshima,"Another must see tourist attraction in Kagoshima. This place can easily reached by bus. Would recommend slowly walk through the garden to enjoy scenery. Also, there is a museum next to this garden. One can buy a package ticket for two attractions."
Beautiful landscape garden with great view of Sakurajima,"Driving down from Kumamoto, I chose Sengan-en to view Sakurajima, rather than go to the observatory or the prefectural building and I am glad I did. The gardens were constructed in the 1650's by the Shimazu family, which ruled the area for a considerable time. They couldn't have picked a better spot with its stunning views of Sakurajima and Kagoshima Bay. The residence, which was rebuilt in the late 1800's and the rooms show life at it was in those days. There are two restaurants and a matcha cafe, gift shops with local crafts of wood and satsuma kiriko (cut-glass crystal), and snacks, sweets and delicacies. Entrance is 1300 yen for the garden, museum and house (recommended) or just 1000 yen for the garden and museum. My wife and I spent about 3 hours there. This is one place that shouldn't be missed."
Not exquisitely manicured but beautifully situated,One can readily understand why the site was originally chosen as it is beautiful. But do not come expecting the exquisitely manicured variety of Japanese gardens
Well worth a visit,"The Sengan-en Garden, a World Heritage Site, was absolutely beautiful and, as there were few people around in the morning, we could wander around and really enjoy the gardens. The variety of shades of green was stunning but there was little in the way of colour except for the blossom still left on a few cherry trees. There was a restaurant which apparently has a good reputation and a shop selling high quality goods. It was possible to taste a variety of local gin. We also looked around the Shoko Shuseikan museum with its history of armaments and Samurai swords."
A must see when you visit Kagoshima,"check our their beautiful website; you will be mesmerized.  This is an extremely well preserved historic site with excellent restaurants, shops and preserved buildings.  One can easily see how the ruling lord of the area could enjoy the daily view of Sakurajima.  It is worth planning a full day there.  Easy access as a tourist via the City view bus (get a daily bus pass)."
Tour the house and gardens ,"The house makes you feel like you’re back in time. Kimono dressed ladies greeting you, Japanese gardens with statues and shrines. Gift shops, restaurants and food shops. A wonderful view of Mt Sukurajima across the harbor. Must see. An easy bus ride from the port or downtown."
Beautiful ,"These gardens, on a hillside were beautiful with well kept lawns and many flowers and trees. There was also a house to visit and great views of the volcano. There were also shops and rest rooms and a restaurant. The stone lanterns were impressive"
Beautiful Garden,This is a really beautiful Japanese Garden. The volcano and bay serve as the backdrop. There are several old buildings used as restaurants and gift shops but they are not intrusive. You have many different paths to take and can easily get away from the crowds
Access by bus,It's a bit far from downtown bit worth the trip. Bus can be very busy depending if a cruise ship is in port.
"Beautiful, Not Cheap; Allow 2+ hours","It's a bit pricey at 1300 yen. But it's nice. Good photo ops. Beautiful gardens and shrines and vistas. Allow at least 2 hours to get the full appreciation of the place. 3 might be better for those seeking meditative solace, reconnecting with nature, or looking to do some more involved photography. The best way to get here is with the 600 yen all-stops all-day bus/tram pass, specifically on the City Sightseeing Bus, and which can be purchased at the info desk at Chuo Eki (terminal), and which allows you to hop on & off anywhere along the route all day."
Beautiful gardens.,"Well worth the visit, easy to get to, easy to get around. Close to other parks worth seeing. They had food and shops inside and great museums as well."
Elegant with amazing borrowed scenery,Sengan-en is a little out of town but easy to get to by bus. It's well worth the trip. The  gardens are beautiful and well maintained. There are various pockets of the garden to discover. Sakura-jima is constantly in view and provides an awe-inspiring backdrop. There's a small extra charge to enter the Shimazu clan house but don't miss it. You can see how one of Japan's most prominent families lived.
Beautiful garden with Sakurajima view,"This beautiful garden used to be the resident of the Shimadzu family . Love the beautiful Japanese landscape with the view of Sakurajima right in front of the front yard. The house is huge with many rooms with maze- like corridors. The middle is a small yet elegant small garden with a small pond. Well maintained & well designed,definitely a must visit if you love the ancient japanese architecture & landscapes especially the residents of the rich & famous."
a wonderful look at the past,"this is a really great historic home to visit, with minimal visitors and of course, boasting the best views of the amazing volcano. We couldn't work out the buses so just took a cab, which was cheap anyway. The gardens are beautiful too, i'd say you could spend 2 hours here."
Very beautiful,"A very lovely garden and very interesting shops too. Strange, unique flower protectors around the peonies. Parking costs 300 yen."
Better than I expected,"I'm normally a person who prefers city nights rather than daytime visits to serene gardens. So it was a surprise to enjoy the Sengan-en Gardens and grounds. Walking around this historical site was enjoyable and I learned a lot about the Shimadzu family and this era of Japanese history. It's also nice to take in the view and scenery, along with the fresh air."
Pretty garden,The subtropical gardens designed for a samurai lord overlook Kinko bay and sakurajima volcano.  They are not exceptional gardens but we visited during the chrysanthemum festival so the grounds were full of beautiful blooms and exquisite colours. The garden has a few moderately priced eatery's and shops. Try the purple sweet potato or green tea ice cream both local delicacies and both surprisingly nice.
Pretty,Fairly pretty - well signed in English with shops and a nice view of the volcano. can get there by the tourist bus. Pricey though.
Magical garden,We went a bit before sunset and the garden was simply stunning! Leave enough time to explore all of it!
Mmmmm and....,"This place was ok.... some real nice garden bits, not amazing, it was expensive though I thought. I got yelled at to use the ticket machine despite there being people to sell tickets to us. Lots of expensive shops. Reading up on the place I appreciated it. But didn’t really impress"
A unique Japanese garden,Have been in different Japanese garden.  This one is unique because the garden is facing ocean and Sakurajima.
Better to visit during sunny day,"When I visited, it was rainy and wasn't good to take a look slowly.And the view of Sakurajima was just okay.I think it's nice to visit for 2~4 hours during sunny day."
Must visit,"This is a must see location in Kagoshima, it is a heritage reservation, a really beautiful garden and house where the lord of the province used to live. It has a great view of Sakurajima, and a lot of feng shui settings in the garden. There is a Starbucks nearby which is used to be a gold mine."
Nice UNESCO garden,"Pretty Japanese garden with lots of greenery for a relaxing stroll. Also a good view of the active volcano from the garden. The place is quite big, so there is some walking to do."
Nice garden with beautiful scenery of sakurajima,A nice place to spend half day there. Good for photo taking and a short visit to the Iso Residence is a must.
"Beautiful Gardens, Lovely Tea Room & Shops","Easily accessible by city bus from Kagoshima, this is a worthwhile destination for the beautiful gardens, the history and the lovely shops and tea room."
Nice Japanese Garden,"One of the major sites in Kagoshima, the garden is mapped out nicely with a nice order and the upkeep is very good. There is a glass museum/shop next door. Inside the garden, you have numerous opportunities for shopping all kinds of Japanese trinkets."
Samurai history I never knew,A group of us were traveling to Kagoshima on business and our local friends gave us a tour of local places. This old samurai 'palace' garden was beautiful and the displays were interesting. There were many English translations from which I learned several new facts and interesting history.
Gardens in the Rain,"It was pouring down most of our visit here but well worth it the gardens were very well looked after. We watched a team of 3 workers slowly trim a tree a sprig at a time, in the rain. There are several features to the gardens, river, waterfall bamboo area &  impressive trees that I do not know the name of. Entrance to the house of the Shimazu clan is an  extra charge. Price to enter gardens is 300 yen per adult and includes Shoko Shuseikan museum. There are shops, cafe & a restaurant inside the complex."
Great feeling,Walking around you get a great feeling of ancient life as a royal... the grounds are well marked out. Make sure you go around back up the very old stone stairs..
Beautiful gardens,"These are beautiful gardens, well worth a stroll.  You can even see reminders of the beginning of industrialization in Japan."
Enjoyable view and walk,"Undoubtedly offers a great view of the volcano, but also worth taking the time to walk around the entire garden and the house.  Recommend to allocate more time to enjoy this place. For shopaholics, there's a tax refund counter in Sengan-en, super convenient."
Exquisite Views of the Bay & Volcano,"Also called Iso Teien, the garden is a serene Japanese style landscape garden constructed in 1660. Offering exquisite views of the bay and volcano, the former villa of the powerful Shimazu clan includes artificial rivers and mountains, a bamboo grove, cascading waterfall and traditional poem writing garden. The adjacent Shoko Museum fee is included with the garden entrance fee.... don't miss it."
Clever Use of Borrowed Scenery,"Having visited 4 superb gardens in Tokyo & 1 in Hrioshima, this garden came as a dissappointment although in fact it is a very good garden. The major aspect is the opportunity to visit the House.To gain entry to the garden a ticket can onlyt be purchased using one of the Automatic Machines. The attendants at the gate were rather brusque which for the Japanese I found very surprising.The site cleverly uses the backdrop of the hills and across the water to Mount Ontake (& its smoking Volcano).The site is basically long & thin. From the gate travelling east the garden stretches about 550m and at its widest (around the house) about 110m. Westwards from the Main Gate there are the musuems. Outside the site and to the western edge is the factory with it's showroom & visit to the glass-blowing.Walking around the garden the parths are of shingle and this has a habit of getting into open sandals (best to wear shoes).When we were there the main pond had been drined for maintenance and obviously could have looked better. Of note (apart from the House) whilst walking around was the Tin Gate, the Original Main Gate, the Jumping Lion Lantern, the Oniwa Shrine and the water-powered Rice Pounder.In the shops the was very beautiful & expensive glassware for saleJust outside the Site (by the car park) was the simple Tsurugane Shrine"
"Enjoyable, despite the rain","It's wonderful to be a tourist. Why do I say that? Because it enabled us to visit Sengan-en (Iso-telen) garden in Kagoshima, Japan, which was very enjoyable, even in the rain and rain it did the day we visited. The grass was sparkling. Trees were greener than green. A delight for the eye and the mind. Visibility was limited. If not, we would have been able to enjoy views of Sakurajima. The garden (and villa) was the private property of the Shimazu family (and of the last Samurai), combining, said our guide, Edo period gardening and Meiji modernization. It's now a UNESCO heritage site. The Samourai used to arrive by boat. The main gate has direct access to the sea. Must have been an imposing sight indeed.    The gate into the garden proper – not the outside gate – was for the Samurai only and for his son.    He was tall, 1.80 meters, weighing over 100 kg.  An imposing figure in his time.  There’s a statue of him in Kagoshima and Tokyo.       There are no queues.  No discount for students. No dressing code. It's a garden."
Nice view of Sakurajima,Nice traditional Japanese garden. When we visited in Feb there is a few cherry blossom which makes it more beautiful. Inside there are souvenirs shop and tea house which you can have tea and sweets.
Enjoyable. Great view of Sakurajima. ,"The grounds and the views are very nice. My favourite section was at the very far end of the garden, where it was quiet.  Crowds were not excessive , even for Golden Week."
Fantastic and informative,"The weather was wet but it almost made the gardens seem more fresh and beautiful.  A visit to the house is a must, and there are helpful information boards in both Japanese and English that reveal the interesting story behind this amazing structure."
A must see place of history ,"With lovely gardens, an impressive Japanese mansion, an views of Sakurajima volcano in the background this place is a must see. Read the history of the Shimadzu family before you go to get a feeling for what was going on then - or better yet go with someone who can explain the history and all the nuances that go with it - and it will come alive to you as you stroll through it. There are shops that sell the glass, and cedar wood products made during that period. Also, stop at the sweet potato candy and vinegar shop. You can easily spend a day there."
A beautiful example of why Japan needs more garden parks,"Beautiful gardens and traditional Japanese buildings. Entry fee is perhaps a little, but when nice gardens and parks are such a rarity in Japan, it is worth it."
Amazing!,"Really nice garden, perfect for sunny days. You can walk around the place, have some sweets, while having the best view to the volcano."
Peaceful and quiet,This site is definitely worth a visit. Probably the best site for me in Kagoshima.The grounds are well kept and you get an excellent view of Sakurajima island and the volcano. There are many different paths to take to walk around and get a sense of the peace and serenity of the environment.Easy to get to with the one day Cityview bus ticket which is only Yen 600. well worth it.
exclusive Japanese sweets available only in Goten,"Sengen-en garden was created for Shimazu clan.  The house where Shimazu lived is called Goten.    When we visited, Goten was accessible only by the guided tour.  At the end of tour, there was a tea ceremony,  Kimono-lady served Green matcha tea and a small sweets.  That sweet was so delicious.   With a hint of citrus,  the taste matches the matcha green tea.  The sweet is called Hiryuzu.  Only available in Goten.  If you like Japanese sweets, this is must buy. It will require extra 300 yen to see inside the Goten, but with this tea ceremony and a chance to buy this sweets,  it is worth."
I went as close as possible to the main residence to command the best view of the garden with the borrowed scenery.,"Sengan-en’s home page writes “Sengan-en is a traditional Japanese garden and stately home in Kagoshima, Japan, that has been passed down in the Shimadzu family for over 350 years. The garden boasts spectacular views of active volcano Sakurajima, and the house provides a glimpse into the lifestyle of a powerful feudal lord.” We paid the admission fee of 1,000 yen that allows you to visit both the gardens and Shuuseikan and as we made our way to the residence and main garden area there were gift shops with an extensive range of local products from food to craft. Following the gift shops we came to a recommended photo site with a spectacular view of Mount Sakurajima. The best view of the garden with the borrowed scenery in the back is admired from the best room in the residence. So I went as close as possible to the main residence to command this spectacular view. We next followed the path to the Kyokusui garden, where Kyokusui events are held. Sengan-en’s home page tells that the event “is an elegant poetry game originating in ancient China in which small cups of sake are floated down a winding stream. Participants dressed in traditional clothing sat along either side of the stream must write a waka poem before the cup passes in front of them. On completing their poems the participants take the cup from the stream and drink the sake.” I understand that if you pay an additional 600 yen, you can take a guided tour of the main residence. Unfortunately we didn’t have the time. In any event well worth the admission fee. Brochures are available in multiple languages."
"Worth a visit, serene and well laid out","We loved this garden with its lovely stone bridges, waterfalls, temples and twists and turns. It was a gorgeous sunny day when we went which made it just perfect. Well worth a visit."
Exquisite ,"This is a beautiful Japanese garden. Typically understated, with beautifully shaped trees and wonderful Rick formations. You can spend a few hours here and come out refreshed, mentally cleansed."
A beautiful and historical Garden,"Taking the local bus service to this location provides you with a fabulous couple of hours to wander around and see the landscaping, various flowers and the results of early interactions between the local people and western sailing vessels."
Nice garden and remains,"The garden showed a nice collection of flowers in november. Compared to the sublime samoerai gardens in Chiran, an hour from Kagoshima, the Sengan-en Garden was less astonishing. A nice garden with some remains  of the first industrialization of Japan."
Just lovely,The gardens are well worth taking your time and exploring all the walkways. There is a terrace with a great view of Sakurajima. There are lots of gift shops and cafes when you first enter but leave them till later and explore the well set out gardens. If a ship is in port then it can be quite crowded.
Beautiful,Beautiful and quiet garden with an unobstructed view of Sakurajima. It's probably best to visit it earlier in the morning or later in the evening as the sun is very harsh even in mid-October.
Beautiful area,Superbe garden with a lot if history which is explained during the visit. In the beginning it seems like many giftshops in a row but the part in the back can be quiet and is very beautiful. Views to Sakurajima are great. One can get to Sengan by sightseeing bus or a short taxi ride from Dolphin Port mall.
Beautiful grounds,"I'm a fan of Japanese gardens and I always find something unique for each garden.  This garden of Kagoshima stands out as using Sakurajima (the volcano) and Kagoshima Bay as borrowed scenery.  Further, there are tropical plants which are not seen in gardens in other parts of Japan.The grounds are bigger than I thought and one should allow enough time to stroll through the grounds.  This garden is a popular sight of Kagoshima.  I think most tourist groups visit sites in the morning.  I didn't get there until 3:30pm to avoid the crowds.  It was quiet and very enjoyable.  The lighting at that time of day also works well with photos."
A Kagoshima Staple,"A short bus ride away from the heart of Kagoshima City, Sengan-en provides the perfect sanctuary for locals and tourists alike from the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden, which doubles as a UNESCO World Heritage site in conjunction with the adjacent Shoko Shuseikan, is where the powerful feudal Shimadzu family once resided. The site includes several restaurants that highlight the local cuisine in Kagoshima as well. For the penny-pinchers, you will be glad to learn that visitors can get TAX-free for souvenirs and even snacks that do not have to be consumed on site. Despite visiting the site in the summer, without any special event going on, we found the gardens beautiful. For us, it was particularly interesting to note the Chinese influences, such as feng-shui and bamboo groves, that were incorporated into the garden. Remember to strap on a pair of sneakers as the garden is huge and even has a hiking trail leading to a panoramic view of Sakurajima and Kinko bay that you won’t want to miss. Although simple, don’t forget to pick up a fan at the entrance as it can get quite hot in the summer."
Good Japanese park,It's was a rainy day on my visit The view is good and there are beautiful flowers in the garden However the entrance fee is a bit pricey
Nice retreat,Beautiful gardens well-maintained. Learn a bit more of the relationship between the Shimoda family and Saigo Takamori.
Charming Japanese garden and temples.,"Senganen is a charming Japanese garden, filled with Banzai trees and manicured lawns. The garden and the residence  was in possession of the Shimadzu family for over 350 years.  Today it's open to the public, for a small fee (around $10).  Take your time there.  Enjoy the beautiful greenery and the architecture.There is a small Cat Shrine, in the complex, dedicated to, well.. cats.  It's a part of the tour.  It's small so don't miss it.  A gift shop next door sells hand-made bamboo sculptures and ""jewelry"".   Don't miss the Ramen restaurant nearby.  It was my first time trying the real Japanese Ramen and it was delicious.To get there take a City View Bus, ISO line.  It operates every 30 minutes or so, from 9am to 5:30pm. Senganen Garden has its own stop.  To get back to the city take same bus.  It makes a one-way loop around town.  Word of advice - see Senganen in the morning.  Not because it's crowded - it's usually not, but because on the way back you can hop off the ISO bus at Ishibashi Park and visit the bridges there.  But, that's a different review. :)"
Must come at the right time!,"It's a big garden facing a beautiful mountain across the sea. The only setback for our visit was that we were just few days earlier before the sakura were fully bloom. However I could envision the beauty of the surroundings. Even without the sakura, it still big and fun to explore. I particularly enjoy climbing up to the mountain top. The air is fresh and you can have a great view of the coastal area. There's no stalls along the way, so it's kind of like jungle trails. Be prepared to bring water along the way. You'll have no regrets!"
"Nice garden, but uneventful","It was our 8th day of our trip to Kagoshima after several days in more rural spots and volcanos before we have reached the city.  By this time, we feel that we have seen all the nature, so the entrance price didn't feel justified."
Not bad to pay a visit,Nothing very special but u can view the Sakurajima Mountains here. Not as expected as seen in the tourists leaflet. Not bad to pay a visit if u have time.
A favourite,"We visited this as part of a tour from a cruise.. This certainly was a highlight. Such an amazing complex.. Gardens , Temples, ponds etc.. And the view out to the volcano was an unusual feature also.. Saw a submarine out in the water too.Luckily had quite abit of time here to admire everything.."
Beautiful Gardens ,"We arrived here just before midday and had an excellent lunch at the Ohkatei restaurant, an ice cold Beer to start with and cool down, then a sea bream set lunch with cold sake.  We followed this with a peaceful walk through the grounds and climbed up to the first viewpoint - this is not marked on the guide map but is easy to find and not too arduous whilst it is cool.  A beautiful setting and well worth the visit"
Nice gardens with Volcano as backdrop ,We came here as part of a shore excursion on a cruise.  There is a museum of the factory that was here which has a film to watch.  There is also a garden which has remnants of the factory plus the gardens with hiking trails and waterfalls.  There are numerous shops and a restaurant here.  I tried the sweet potato ice cream.  The cat shrine was cool and you can post a prayer for your pet.
Beautiful. That is All,"I thought this place was absolutely beautiful.  It offers a lovely walk with some pretty plants, great scenery and some lovely water features. I enjoyed wandering around on the sunny lunchtime I visited...it wasn't packed and was really very nice.The view across to Sakura-jima is probably one of the best on offer in Kagoshima. Don't miss it.The entry fee of Y1000 includes a museum in the price, but I didn't have time to visit it. There are a few restaurants, some shops and gift shops on site.If you have mobility issues you will be limited to the lower half of the garden...which would be a shame as some of the nicest parts are a climb up step/uneven steps. I used the cute pass to get here which I purchased from the tourist info desk at JR Kagoshima-chuo. It has plenty of frequent buses to the garden from the station and around Kagoshima."
Not to be missed,"We were late arriving at the garden but although we did rush it,it is not to be missed. The views of Sukurajima are fantastic with gingo bay.I knew before I went that the garden borrowed the view but I had no idea how spectacular it would be."
Garden with the best Sakurajima view,"The great garden of the city lord, with a nice view of Sakurajima. The garden is quite big with a 400 meters mountain trail, which has a great and clear view of the famous volcano mountain. The garden is about a 40 mins bus drive from the central Kagoshima city, and is easily accessible through the 'city view bus', which ran through major attractions within Kagoshima."
Good place to understand the history of Shimazu Clan.,"This park is good place to understand how Lords of Shimazu Clan lived and how they prepared for The Meiji restoration, years of political change.They tried to catch up with developed nations by building various factories and iron mills.  You can also see the factory of Satsuma Kiriko, a local cut glass factory.  The local restaurants are also available.It takes about 45 minutes from the Kagoshima Central Station by city but.The thing is, entrance fee is a little bit expensive."
Beautiful garden,"Sengaen garden is a big n beautifully designed garden. U can see typical Japanese style structure. From there u can also overlook the great volcano Sakurajima. A few eateries there. One is serving the famous Satsuma chicken. The cityview bus has a stop there, but make sure u check the last bus that returns to city centre, I think the last bus is around 5:00-5:30. It's quite far away from city center like Tenmonkan area. So don't miss it."
Wonderful stroll,Very nice view on the Sakurajima volcano. The stroll through the gardens (quite diverse) is really beautiful.
Peaceful serenity ,The garden was very peaceful and beautiful. It took me a while to see everything as its beauty caught my eyes I could do nothing but take it nice and slow. It felt quite romantic and the food there I could not have enough of.
Beautiful Garden,"Located outside the city, in a nice area with great view on Sakurajima. The garden is lovely, you can take a walk for around 30 minutes and also visit the main house including tea ceremony. There are some restaurants and souvenir shops. There is also a longer trail to go on top of the hill with great views on the bay and the island.I really like the garden which is really pretty! And it is a calm place to relax!"
Spectacular private garden worth your visit,"1) Different spots for photo sessions and sightseeing. You can view the Sakurajima from here. 2) If you're hungry, don't worry. There're 3 restaurants in the garden, which serve Japanese cuisine. We tried the satsuma ramen and it's good. For snacks lover, you can find sweet potato softcream ice cream, grilled mochi etc at the shoplots nearby the entrance. 3) Spare at least 2 hours for sightseeing and a meal. Tips: Wear a comfortable shoes for the walk."
Not to be Missed in Kagoshima,"If you are in Kagoshima make sure to visit this old former estate with beautiful Japanese gardens.  We were there in early spring and the trees were just beginning their blossoms -- really beautiful.  In addition to the gardens there are a number of interesting shops selling food and souvenirs including Satsuma porcelain and other local items.  There is an interesting museum with exhibits on local production of armaments and other industrial equipment from the 1800s and 1900s, plus a fascinating doll exhibit.  Excellent view across to Sakurajima Volcano.  Good washroom facilities as well."
Japanese natural style garden at its best,"Very varied with plenty of blossom of various types despite it not quite being Sakura time. Peaceful despite the other visitors. Lots to explore. It starts out as a museum to some captain of industry with outdoor relics and the opportunity to try a martial art involving whacking sticks but soon becomes a series of different garden styles with little streams and waterfalls, lanterns, gentle steps up and down, bamboo water features. Very zen. There are several shops and restaurants which are not overpriced and we had a delicious pork ramen bowl at the end. Nearby you can also see glassblowing and the creation of the local coloured cut glass."
Good garden visiting ,"I rated it as 4 stars based on the clearness, size of garden and the shops.well trimmed vegetation and trees with zen ambiance.The sculpture there were not attractive which is out of expectation.size of garden is good and visitor can walk and finish trail within 2 hours. Wide diversity shop types there, price is acceptable as well."
Beautiful,"A really nice garden. Great view of Sakurajima. Make sure you go on a clear, sunny day. Recommend getting the one-day city sightseeing bus and tram pass."
Do the residence tour and be prepared to pat,"It was a nicely maintained garden, which explains the pricey admission rates. If you make the trip there, You have to do the residence tour. It is interesting and informative. The garden promises photo opportunities especially in the right season. Hopefully you manage to avoid the crowds and take a peaceful stroll around."
Beautiful garden and a scene of history,once you get away from the entrance this garden opens up to it's full beauty and you see why the rulers of the day made it and lived there.  Take the time to walk to the boundaries of the garden and you will be rewarded with some spectacular views
Pricey admission,"Sengan-en garden, built by the Shimazu clan, is a pleasant spot for a stroll.  We skipped the residence as it required a separate admission in addition to the already steep 1000 yen ticket.  While the garden area was nothing special compared to some of the other famous Japanese gardens, the bamboo forest and some of the pavilions were very picturesque.  On a clearer day, the Sakurajima volcano backdrop would have looked amazing.  There was a small shop serving the local version of mochi called jyanbo mochi, drenched in sweet thick soy sauce, where we ended our visit."
Quiet and peaceful garden for knowing 藩主life ,"Paid some more to go to the 主殿. You can have a taste of the matcha and the little cake. Unfortunately, there is no audio guide in English and Chinese, but merely enjoying the view is enjoyable enough. If you have watched the drama 篤姬，you can certainly recall the filming scenes in the movie :)"
Wonderful,It was such a nice place to visit. Cost 1000yen for 1 person tour of the grounds and museum. So picturesque and calming. Make sure to complete the hike at the top of the route to  see the most magnificent view of the bay and volcano. Took around half hr one way. The museums were also interesting.
Too expensive,US$16 visiting a house and gardens is too expensive though it includes a sweet and Maccha. You can enjoy the same great view of Sakurajima near the place
Beautiful garden and hike,"This garden exceeded my expectations. Spectacular view out to the volcano and a great hike is available if you're of medium + fitness. You can wander around as long as you like, and even feed the koi carp. I recommend going early as it's popular with groups, even Japanese tour groups! A great way to see the city and get to the garden is by the city view bus. These leave the JR Shinkansen station very regularly (bus stop 4)."
Must go place in Kagoshima with breathtaking view,A world cultural heritage japanese garden. used to be a shimazu residence overlooking sakurajima. there is also short path up the hill. try to visit late afternoon sunset view of sakurajima is amazing.must also try the mochi.
Expensive garden ,"When we visited the garden on the late September, the sun is still very hot. garden is nice, but it's expensive (2000yen/person). Parking is at 300 yen. There are some restaurants inside with a nice view to the sakurajima, it's one of the best place to spend the hot afternoon at the garden."
A MUST SEE tourist attraction in Kagoshima -,"Seagan-en Garden & Museum is one of the MUST SEE tourist attractions in Kagoshima. The gardens are located a little outside of town, but have a stop of the CITY VIEW Bus tour. Hence easily reachable. From there you have great views of Sakurajima (volcano) and Kinko Bay."
Beautiful Short Walks,"Lots of short walks through forest, rocks over streams and footpath to many buildings.Souvenir shops, small restaurants and toilets, all immaculate. Entrance fee 1000 yen.This includes a small but interesting museum just opposite the gardens."
"Get the tourist bus downtown, less than $10! Don't pay for the cruise tour - this is a GREAT place to see on your own!","Don't-miss location: Kagoshima was THE easiest coastal city we visited. Downtown, hop on the bus just for tourists; stops at all major attractions for under $10 per person. Bring kids to beautiful Sengan-en Garden for outstanding hikes - wonderful trail to a waterfall at the top which you can see if you are not on a cruise tour! Koi ponds, a GORGEOUS palace. Also some of the best shops we saw on our cruise - beautiful, affordable Japanese craft items."
A must visit when in Kagoshima! Try visiting in the morning or late afternoon when it's not too hot.,"This was of the highlights of our visit in Kagoshima. Very well preserved, Japanese gardens with beautiful trees and flowers. We went there during lunch time and it was very hot, almost annoying walking around with so much heat. The gardens provide fans at the entrance and you can take with you while walking around. That was a relieve along with cool wave machines around the place. Thanks also to the big trees we found some shadow at times. The gardens include little shrines, lakes, waterfalls and a small bamboo forest. Personnel is very friendly and we even had a short conversation with a woman there, not very common in Japan to talk in english and she was excellent in english I have to say! We appreciated a lot! I was impressed by the cleanliness everywhere including the toilets! Although it is a public place toilets were spotlessly clean and well supplied! This is not very common in public toilets in our western cultures... no offense though!"
Lots to explore,"Being quite large, garden offers many different views. You can also climb up the hill (15-20 min) and if weather is good, enjoy Sakurajima's wonderful profile."
Breath-taking views.,"This is now my third time visiting the Senganen Gardens of Kagoshima.  The beautiful landscape, and history of the gardens is truly magical.  English translations are availabe for maNY of the exhibits, and do not miss the Residense tour."
Well designed old Japanese garden,"Went to visit the large garden of Senganen in Kagoshima on the East coast of southern Kyushu in May 2016. The park faces the active volcano, Sakurajima on the island just off the coast. The garden is very old and has beautiful rock work, streams and small ponds. This is the most southern major Japanese garden on the main islands of Japan, and has quite a few palm trees as part of the flora.  There is a shaded turf area on the upper part of the garden that hosts special festivals beside the meandering stream.  There are several Japanese museums located within the garden's confines and require separate fee.  The history of the garden is explained in the garden brochure and explains the importance of the garden and the various buildings.  The garden faces the sea and choice (limitations) of plants is interesting.  Maintenance could be better, but it is well worth a visit."
Beautiful garden,"Senganen is a nice place both for history lovers and nature lovers. Indeed, its traditional Japanese garden is historically valuable and worth to visit, and at the same time the view of Sakurajima from the garden is unforgettable. You can imagine how the life of Satuma Lord was."
Must go place in Kagoshima,"Kagoshima is a unique place in the Japanese history. Located at the edge of southern part of Japan and far from major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, it played a significant role in industrialization of Japan with a series of great leaders. This Sengan-and Shusei-kan area is the great spot to learn it. Highly recommended to hire a English translation machine at the entrance. Also 20min tour for Shimazu general's residence is very interesting. It is not a huge place but you can enjoy a good 3hrs. If you love Japanese history, this is a great place to come. Even if you do not care the history, you can still enjoy its beautiful garden and great view of volcano mountain; Sakurajima. Must go place !"
"Beautiful garden, with the volcano as the picturesque background","A must see when in Kagoshima, the path up to the lookout is worth the climb, and gives you a good view over some of Kagoshima and the volcano."
Fantastic,"Superb gardens and interesting museum. But do not miss the view from the top of the footpath that leads to a couple of high terraces where one has a great view on Kagoshima and Sakurajima. Quite a hike, though."
Soooo beautiful,The garden is very beautiful its worth to see it...there is a nice view to Sakurajima...its very close to kagoshima so with bus (2 child.pix are on it) takes u there i think nr 11.
must go place in kagoshima,although this garden is a bit far away from city center but there's tourist bus directly stop at the front door of the garden from JR station which takes around 30-45min. The garden is a bit walk and you can even hike to the mountain.  Don't miss the royal garden which has beautiful layout and great view to sakurajima. And it's also splendid under Sakura trees. there're quite a few dining options and shops. The museum next to the garden is a bit boring though.
Fabulous Garden in a wonderful setting,"The friendly greeting by staff to this beautiful garden would encourage anyone to return. It's setting opposite Sakurajima Volcano is quite unique & despite being on the nearby island dominates the view. This Japanese garden is full of surprising groupings, stone, statuary & topiary in various forms. Only wish we'd had more time to take the hill walk, so leave time if you can to explore ! Beautiful."
A nice garden worth looking at,"We visited in cherry blossom season, although despite some other reviews suggesting so, I don't really think you really need to visit this garden in spring to appreciate it. It's well designed and nice to stroll through, we found it one of the highlights in our trip to Kagoshima."
Learn the japanese history from this home,Beautiful home and garden of the feudal lord of japan.  You feel like that you were back in time.  Don't miss the residence visit though you would need to pay a bit more for the admission.  It is an eye opener for those who are interested in japanese culture.  The garden itself is beautiful and serene.  Do spend more time to walk and explore the upper part of the garden though there are some slopes and stairs.
Beautiful garden plus history,It has historic display of the western influence and Japanese industrial revolution while the scene is set in a beautiful Japanese garden.
Excellent view of sakurajima and kinko port,Climb the short trail to where the lord of the clan once walked to aid his thinking. Beautiful view of sakurajima and the port at the observatory points.The area around the feudal lord residence has been beautiful landscaped. Impressive and peaceful scenery. Definitely worth a visit if you are a nature and history kinda person.
Nice Japanese Garden,"This is supposed to be one of the residence of past feudal Lord Shimazu of Kaogshima. However, if you want to visit the actual residence, it's an extra fee and not cheap. Just strolling along the garden is nice, but there are very few exhibits that speaks to that piece of history. Visit the museum next to Senganen which is included in your admission fee is better"
Beautiful in November with chrysanthemums in bloom,"We spent a day wandering in the Senganen Garden, participating in a tea ceremony, watching glass making and eating a fantastic tonkatsu lunch in a restaurant with spectacular views of Sakurajima.  The chrysanthemums were in bloom and displays were everywhere, including bonsai chrysanthemums.  Interesting and beautiful. We enjoyed our day very much."
Historic + Scenic = Not to be Missed!,"The Gardens are built on a historic site, which includes some early irrigation systems and a preserved home. It's a great place to walk around and take photographs. The kanji carving in the side of the mountain is really incredible to view as well. The cat shrine is a plus, too, as are the gift shops. On a clear day, you can see across the bay to Sakurajima, making this a very scenic location in northern Kagoshima City. TIP: Wear good shoes and take the hiking trails up to lookout spots."
Historical and Beautiful,"I visited this place twice (with a friend and then with my wife). I cycled from central Kagoshima to Sengan-en the first time which took about 40-50 minutes so the second time I caught the 600¥  sight-seeing bus service from Chuo-eki station (600¥ per stop but you can upgrade your ticket to last the whole day and is valid for 3 days). An added bonus of this bus tour is that it stops at all the main sights within 30 minutes driving from central Temonkan (i.e. Meiji Restoration Museum, Terukuni Shrine, Saigo Takamori caves/statue/burial site,Tsurumaru Castle ruins, Shiroyama Observatory AND Sengan-en Gardens to name a few). I recommend visiting Sengan-en in early Spring (when the cherry blossoms are in bloom) or in mid-Autumn when the weather is cool and beautiful daisies and the deciduous tree leaves begin to change colour (avoid rainy days or the rainy season). Sengan-en is set as a traditional Japanese garden which was owned by the Shimadzu family (leading clan) for over 350 years. The garden has amazing views of Sakurajima, and the house gives you an insight into the lifestyle of a samurai lord. You can also take a hike up the trail to the lookout (400m elevation and get a better panoramic view of Sakurajima and Kagoshima City - great photo op!). Sengan-en was a vital area during  the modernization of Japan and it is where western industrial technology was introduced into Japan via its factories. Next to it is a museum (entry fee inclusive of Sengan-en fee) and boasts collections from the sites illustrious past. You may visit nicer gardens in Kyoto or other places but at only 1100¥ per adult, this site is worth visiting when you are in Kagoshima. It is simply fantastic!"
Beautiful,"Beautiful scenery, stunning gardens that are extremely well kept, quite a bit of history and some shops, with high quality local foods, absolutely out of this world handmade glass craft of such exquisite quality that I have never seen in my life and all kinds of other cool stuff! Go and spend at least 4 hours there... So beautiful..."
Don't bother,"Decided to check this out based on the positive reviews. Boy, was I disappointed! Big piece of land but nothing spectacular. We saw nicer gardens while driving past some residential areas. Don't bother if you've been to much nicer ones like those in Kyoto."
full of interest took us a whole day,Hired and English audio and learnt so much about the development of the whole area. Excellent chrysanthemums on display. can extend the walk round the attractive gardens by going on a trail. Also interesting museum and good restaurant and good quality souvenir shops of the local produce
Japanese garden at its best,"Loved this garden plus museum with the full use of the natural surrounding elements of water, hills and volcano across the bay.  To do it justice allow around 2 hours minimum.  Both routes of the city view bus calls in here."
Beautiful garden. Beautiful view.,Lovely place. Amazing seeing 350-year-old trees. Visit the museum right beside it. Don't forget to try the matcha soft ice cream. The best match ice cream for me!
Impressive,Was lucky that it was a clear day and and manage to get a clear view of Sakurajima.  Garden is big. Wish I have more time to hike to the top. Would have been better in Spring as there is not much color in the garden. Still plenty to explore.
Beautiful Sight To Behold,"If in Kagoshima' it is a ""must"" to visit.It is truly an extremely beautiful sight to behold.The surrounding of the garden in itself is a great place to walk around and relax.On top of that, one can also have a fantastic view of Sakurajima across the straits.You can take half a day to move about at your own pace. When hungry, you can have a great meal at the restaurant within it's compound."
great view for Sakurajima and Japanese garden design,it could be one of the greatest view for Sakurajima from far and you will not regret for visiting here if you like Japanese garden design and Bonsai
A bit disappointed,"Our disappointment perhaps, was with our guide, who did not seem to know very much. She tried to rush us through this lovely sight. I think we would have enjoyed it more either by ourselves or with a better private guide."
Sengan en garden is a must view,"One of my favourite  places in kagoshima is the sengan en garden.  The garden is so artfully  displayed with typical Japanese  structures. You actually  feel  that you are in a  different  place.  If you have some extra imagination like me,  lol, you might actually  try to find the hobbit there ☺The best part is when you climb up the mountain  to see the amazing  view of sakurajima,   the sea in front of it and the greenery of the mountain. You have to be there!!"
definition of Japanese (Kyushu) beauty,This is a must visit if you're in Kagoshima. The garden is a beautiful traditional Japanese style with Kyushu influences and Kyushu native vegetation. It's like traditional Japan and Hawaii. Let's not forget the amazing view of Sakurajima and the volcanos in the background. Breathtaking views. You can take the several different tourism buses to this location. The buses in Kagoshima are excellent!
A perfect place to spend the afternoon,"The garden is huge and requires a lot of time.  There is much ground to be covered - plan to spend half a day at least.We arrived in Kagoshima too early to check in to our hotel, so we took the bus to the garden.  The annual Chrysanthemum Festival was on which was both a boon and a not so very.  The chrysanthemums were spectacular, but they disrupted the plan and beauty of the garden itself.  Pots of them lined the walkways, displays of all sorts were covered in the flowers, and placed randomly on the lower grounds - samurai, children’s playground toys, mikoshi etc.We were most interested in the numerous old stone lanterns scattered throughout the grounds.  The shapes were fascinating. We had read about and seen photos of two of the lanterns, but there are many, many more.  We tracked down the tin gate, another structure often written about.  The garden is know for its borrowed scenery.  The afternoon we visited was a bit overcast.  The distant views were cloudy.  The further in we walked and the higher up we got in the grounds, the better the view of Sakurajima was.  We found a flat spot of land, overlooking the train tracks with views to the volcano.  If you stand on one of the tables (probably frowned upon and should not be done) you can avoid the power lines for photos.Sago palms, moss, autumn blooming flowers, a wandering stream with stepping stones - the garden was still very vibrant this late fall day.  A huge, ancient tree, braced by enormously thick wires, loomed over the pond and the open space near the Residence.  There were no koyo to be seen - the color was mostly green, or brown from the dead grass, though a few flowering plants were in bloom - and of course all those chrysanthemums. Near the entrance are foundations of the Shuseikan Industrial Complex.  For our autumn much of this were hidden behind chrysanthemum displays.  The large iron cannon was quite impressive.  The furnace where the cannon was cast is behind the cannon, and also behind the chrysanthemums.  These were  listed as world heritage sites in July of 2015 as Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial RevolutionThe entry fee also covers Shoko Shuseikan Museum next to the garden entrance.  We did not visit this and regretted it afterwards. ¥1000 entrance.  We did not pay the additional ¥600 to enter the Residence, but were satisfied with taking exterior photos and looking in to the rooms that were open to the outside."
A nice Japanese style garden,"*this Japanese style garden is nice and spacious, in which you can relax yourself* the garden can be reached easily by the sightseeing bus. *you can enjoy a spectacular view of the sakurajima inside this garden*you can try a traditional mochi-like snacks (two flavour: meso, soy sauce ) inside the garden which tastes good!(don't miss it if you will go to this garden)*a museum also nearby which you can get access by the same entry ticket.* you can get a small gift (traditional candy) by showing the bus pass of the sightseeing bus inside the garden.*wood-crafted souvenirs (especially chopsticks) are excellent , however quite expensive*a few restaurants are available inside the garden ( but have not tried )* you can join a guided-course (Japanese only however) and participate in a sado lesson"
Great Views,"Sengan-en is a well-preserved piece of Kagoshima's history. Walking through the garden is a magical experience, and it feels like stepping into Edo Period Japan. The views are spectacular all around. We took an unplanned trek up the mountain and were met with a wonderful view of Sakurajima at the top. The lunch at Ohkatei was a treat, and the kind staff graciously made changes to the meals to accommodate us vegetarians. Afterward, we had one of Kagoshima's specialty desserts, shirokuma shaved ice - very refreshing! The shops are very cute; my favorite was the one next to the Cat Shrine that sold really adorable cat-related products. The garden is easy to access from the Kagoshima City View Bus."
Beautiful garden,A very beautiful garden with spectacular view of the volcano. The mocha class is highly recommended. The mocha itself is also very tasty.
"Peaceful, serene and memorable","This is the first place I visited when I arrived in Japan, so it has a special place in my heart. I arrived in Kagoshima on the Shinkansen late the night before so I couldn't see much.  In the morning I visited Senganen Gardens. It was really my first impression of Japan. With the active volcano Mount Nakadake in the background, the pristine gardens were a work of art. The trees, streams and buildings were so peaceful and beautiful. I learned about ancient Japan and it was a great first impression."
Urban Sprawl Affects the Garden's Tranquility,"We absolutely love Japanese gardens, but we were disappointed with this one.  The garden itself is beautiful and tranquil, but there is scarcely a spot in the entire garden where you can go and not see a power line or hear a train or car going by.There are gardens deep inside Tokyo that feel more secluded than this one.  I can only imagine that there must have been a lot of battles over the years between the garden keepers and the urban developers.  Apparently the urban developers won out."
"If short of time, visit the foreshore park instead.","Staff were very pushy and hurried you to feed 1000 Yen into the ticket machine. Average gardens and seemed to be just a place to sell gifts, food and beverages."
what a place,brilliant the gardens are immaculate very informative and extremely quite with views of the baythe history of kagashima is fasinating
Wonderful garden…,"This history filled garden is a must while in Kagoshima!We payed 1600￥/adult for an enterance ticket to the Sengan-en / Isotei-en , Shuseikan and Shimadzu family house tour (Japanese)+ green tea set.My 8 year old had a stamp rally with an easy questionnaire at the end…got a clear fille as a reward.We enjoy  this garden every time we visit the city. Enjoy!"
Beautiful gardens with great view of Sakurajima,"We only had half a day in Kagoshima so had to prioritise what was most important to us and we chose to go to Senganen gardens. The garden was extensive but we only managed around a small part of it before we had to turn back to get the bus to the sea port.There are cafes, restaurants and a few souvenir shops. Unfortunately it was overcast the day we were there so we didn't get as clear a view of Sakurajima as we had hoped however, regardless of the overcast, the size of the volcano was obvious and pretty incredible."
great views of Sakurajima with Japanese garden,"The views are excellent, and the garden itself is wonderful- Japanese and Western all at once. However, there are too many shops, restaurants and other attractions inside it that take away from the feeling of the place."
One of the best gardens of Japan,"Perhaps the best garden I saw in all Japan. Take the hike up the mountain to the waterfall viewing platform if you can. It is a joy to walk in the indigenous forrest. The view from the top is also great.There is a great little eatery inside. Also a more formal restaurant, which I didn't try."
Serene garden,"Water, rocks and trees are the components of any Japanese garden and these are very nice.  With cherry blossoms on the way there, and rhododendron just starting to bloom, it added some color.  Over looks the sakurajima  volcano."
"""Beautiful landscape and gardens""",Well-maintained landscape and gardens make strolling within the large compound very relaxing. There is a path to top of the hill which presents magnificent view of the city. A guided tour will include cultural and green tea experiences.
Beautiful Gardens,"Sengan-en is a beautiful garden. It is a relaxing stroll through the different gardens contained within the grounds. We were rushed because dusk was approaching. If you want to relax, set aside an hour or more to wander the garden.Nearby are several other attractions.The city bus stops at the gate and is a cheap and convenient way to get to and from the gardens."
Nice Japanese garden ,Nice garden with good view of sakurajima.     Only problem was that the waterfall here is not worth the climb of steps as it's a super small waterfall that could not be seen on my camera.
Nice view of Sakurajima,"A quite place where you can take a break from your busy travel schedule, drinking tea or coffee, looking around glass art work, munching Japanese mochi. But the best is the view of Sakurajima, which was the purpose of building this garden in the first place. Fantastic view of the volcanic mountain!"
Fascinating both old and new,"The Shimazu were not favorites of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but they were far enough away to act reasonably independently. So in this garden, with its beautiful borrowed landscapes of Sakurajima (now you need to stand in the right place so as to avoid seeing the highway and railway too) you'll see a multiplicity of gardens of various styles as well as the Daimyo's experiments in Western technology at a time when the bakufu would not have approved.if you have the time, climb to the top of the hill. The whole garden is beautiful."
Must visit,Me and wife visited the garden it was amazing we could see sakurajima mt . The garden is s real Jp style
"Unknown treasure, one of Japan's best gardens","This quite simple one of the best Japanese gardens to visit in Japan.   As its in Kagoshima, its relatively unknown and so delightfully, if you are lucky, can almost have it to yourself on the right day.What makes it so good?  What do you want in Japanese garden?  Senganen has almost anything that you wish.The Garden: The garden is relatively large by Japanese standards so this allows you to explore it at your leisure and if you do it slowly will take up to 2 hours depending how long you want to linger.  The garden has many nooks that are hidden around corners, behind moss covered stone walls and hedges cut in pristine condition.  The whole garden is maintained immaculately and the attention to detail over such a large area requires a dedicated team.  Small shrines, a mountain stream that bubbles through garden, changing seasons, the back of the garden framed by mountains and forest and you would never know you are just 10 minutes outside Kagoshima city.Borrowed scenery:  Perhaps the best in Japan!!  They talk about borrowed scenery of Kyoto gardens but I have never seen any place better than Senganen.  The garden is situated no more than 50 metres from Kinko bay that looks like a vast pond right before your eyes.  The bay stretches across to Sakurajima, an active volcano only a few kilometres away which is simply stunning! as it rises magnificiently before you with its smoking peak.  There is no better view in Japan from a garden, a must see for anyone who loves Japanese gardens.History: Sengan-en was built by local Lord Mitsuhisa, the 19th head of the Shimadzu family in the early Edo period so this allows you to enjoy some ambience of old Japan as you imagine days gone past.I went in summer, the green was a beautiful green but it seems that in different seasons the garden changes with the rhythm of nature.  I was lucky, very few people were there during a weekday and and most of the time I could enjoy the garden by myself and soak up its ambience.  There are grassed areas as well and some seating so you can rest and take your time.  You could spend a whole afternnon there if you enjoy Japanese gardens and have the time.Restaurants:  There are some restaurants on the ground, modern buildings and tastefully done.  You can go to the 2nd floor of one establishment and it has full sized windows with unobstructed views across Kinko Bay to Sakurajima. When I was there it quiet so you could stay as long as you wished and just enjoy the incredible view over a delicious lunch.  Shopping:  As you come inside the Garden entrance there are some shops with local crafts, especially wood products from Yakushima, Kagoshima glassware and of course shochu!, the local distilled alcohol usually made from sweet potatoes that is famous all over Japan.  Once again the the shops have been built tastefully, no hawkers outside, and you can just leisurely look through and pick up something if you like.  If you aren't interested in shopping just go straight past them onto the garden.I have lived in Japan for over 10 years, visited Kyoto and its gardens on numerous times, seen the most reputed gardens from all over Japan and I found this to be among one of my favourites.  If you happen to be in Kagoshima you must go, you won't be let down.  For those who really love Japanese gardens it's worth making the effort to to go to Kagoshima for an experience you will never forget and and a memory of sublime beauty that you will have for life."
Senganen Garden,"Absolutely fantastic relaxing environment, not busy, very peaceful and tranquil, you can spend hours in there walking around at your own pace or go through quickly.  The attention to detail is terrific."
Garden with the best view of Sakurajima,"I could know the extraordinary history of shimadzu family by visiting the place.A guided tour to see inside of the villa was great.The villa is  excellent of taste, and we are served green tea and wagashi.It was a great experience, and I want to visit the place again someday."
pretty amazing,Decided to get out of city tour view bus at this station as it was looking pretty interesting. Staff at the counter was extremally happy to help. Gardens.. they are just beautiful. Amazing place to have a walk around. Everything looks so nice and tidy around. There are some little restaurants and souvenir shops where you can try a sample before you buy something. Really worth this yens you have to pay to get in. Extremaly great place to take a nice photos as well.
A historically important site,"The grounds are nice but not spectacular, but I found the museum's explanations about the history of the Shimazu family and how instrumental they had been in introducing and developing Western technology in Japan during the Meiji Period very interesting. There are regular guided tours of the interior of the residence, but we did not partake. There is a nice restaurant with a view of the garden (if you can get a window seat), and  for those interested in shopping, the shops offer a wide range of high quality Japanese crafts."
fabulous samurai garden,"It is worth a visit.Satsuma clan annex are built along sea shore with japanese style garden,samurai houses and no matter what people say overviewing Mt.Sakurazima.adding a taste is having 'iambomochi',yammy. Furthermore is hitorical place for the first furnace io japan and so on.Kagoshima natives are proud of this garden"
"Charming gardens, great residence visit","The Shimazu residence and its gardens are, as expected in Japan, kept simple and neat. Although the visit of the residence is in Japanese only, there is a leaflet in English and the guide will surely help you out. There's even a little surprise at the end. Special thanks to the gentleman welcoming guests at the entrance and all his explanations."
best place to see Sakurajima,"This garden is very beautiful garden and also best place to see Sakurajima!I couldn't go to the short trail course,  but they have the waterfall.   I went to there by bus,  Kagoshima has some around buses,  ""Kagoshima city view"" and ""Machimeguri bus""   both are nice veiw!   If you don't have much time to stay,  I recommend this place!"
Better than I expected,"Wow, what else can I say. This is a must see in Kagoshima, you wont believe the beautiful gardens and walk trails, I spent about one and a half hours including lunch and could have easily had a longer stay and walk. The spectacular gardens, streams, bridges, water falls are breathtaking. Thankyou to the Shimadzu Family for giving us such beauty."
Worth Staying for Hours,"This garden is beautiful, and has so many different parts to discover. We were fortunate to have time to hike up the mountain within the gardens, which I highly recommend if you don't mind a bit of exercise. The view over the city was wonderful, and the hike itself was one of my favorite activities in Japan."
Shows the history of Japan's industrialisation,"Treat this garden as a working lesson on Japan's shift to a modern industrial nation - this is not an example of a sublimely beautiful Japanese garden, although it has majestic views of Sakurajima, it just has too many practical and industrial elements incorporated within to be appreciated as a typical stroll garden. And has been marred by concrete paths and souvenir shops for the hords of visitors. For historical reasons it is however quite interesting to visit, especially if you are interested in Japan's modernisation - the museum next door should be visited also. But if you want to see a really lovely Japanese garden there are many much finer gardens to be seen elsewhere.I also found the garden became quite crowded when overseas tour buses pulled in but noticed that many visitors did not explore the garden fully and there were many interesting 'hidden', quiet corners."
Great stroll through time,"The Shimadzu Clan was very impressive in its development of industries.  And, even more impressive is the garden that embraces their home site.  There are all elements: waterfalls, ponds, hill paths, stone lanterns and beautifullly manicured grounds."
Beautiful grounds,"This garden was very beautiful with lots of Japanese landscape and character.  Went with tour group.  From other's pic it doesn't appears that there's more to see than what we saw.  We had an explanation of the Shimadzu main house and drank tea with a little manju.  There's several gift shops as you exit the property.  Across the street, we went through the museum first.  That museum showed the Shimadzu's family history."
Tranquil and Serene,"This place is serenity personified.  We would love to jettison our current garden and lay it out in Japanese style, specifically like this one. Fair enough very few flowers in bloom as we had missed the Cherry Blossom season by days :(. Several eateries on site and also souvenir shops."
Worth the Visit,Excellent gardens and Original home. Do the tour of the house and take some tea. Great view of the water and the island. Walk around at your own pace.Well worth the visit.
Senganen Garden (aka Isoteien) & Restaurant,Garden is beautifully landscaped; historical site; built by powerful Shimazu clan who ruled the area for 700 years before the restoration; has been used in the NHK TV taiga drama Princess Atsu.  They have beautiful Kagoshima cut glassware on display and for sale at a shop.  Our group ate a very nice lunch in the restaurant in the garden park.
Lovely Japanese Garden,Another excellent garden I Japan. Plenty to see and walk around with good views of Sakajima Island on one side and the hills behind. Yen 1000 entry fee without going around the house (add another Yen 500). Last entry is around 4.00 (maybe a little later) so ensure you arrive in plenty of time. If adventurous try the famous sweet potato soft cream (Yen 300) - not to my taste but worth a try.
Give it time and do some research first,Delightful environment and exceptional giftshop displaying some super high quality glass and ceramics. It's worth taking a bit of time over it all ( half day) and doing a thorough walk through the gardens.
Beautiful  but too commercialized,"The gardens are beautiful and well maintained but the surrounding souvenir shops ruin the ""old Japan"" experience. They sell everything from tea (which is fine) to crystal vases (why?). The sensor activated doors do little to help maintain the samurai era atmosphere.The entrance fee is a bit steep."
So quiet place,"I have loved visiting the whole place, with  our guide, it was really so pleasant ; then we have had the traditional Tea Ceremony, very Japanese ceremony !"
Great Introduction to a Japanese style Garden!  Beautiful!,"This garden is such a beautiful garden! For nature lovers, I think you need at least 2 hours to really enjoy this garden.  Good place to go for a leisurely stroll! This garden is a good way to see a Japanese-style garden. My husband and I, and our 12-year old son really enjoyed it and wished that we had more time. Very beautiful and scenic! Admission is around 1000Y ($10 USD) each with a child discount available.  We also took the Residence tour (extra 500Y/250Y elementary grade child ($5/$2.50 USD extra to get this tour). This guided tour enables you to see how the Shimadzu lived – you’ll actually see the inside of the house. Note, we had a Japanese guide but fortunately we were with somebody who spoke English.  Even without having an English translator, however, I think it’s worth the extra $5 bucks. There are set times for the tours and each take approximately 20 minutes. In addition, you will be served green tea and a small piece of dessert which has the insignia of the Shimadzu family (short tea ceremony). Note the green tea is a traditional Japanese tea, which is substantially creamier than the green tea you find in the US. It has a stronger taste, too. Note, my 12-year son did not like the dessert. My husband and I, however,  enjoyed the tea and the mini dessert. Glad that we paid the extra $.  If you're here, pay the extra $ for the Residence tour."
An oasis of greenery,This traditional Japanese garden at the outskirts of Kagoshima is a real must. Great views towards Sakurajima as well.
Beautiful & quiet,We went on a quiet day - very tranquil and so beautiful.Look out for the little red crabs hiding in the rocks by the pool
Classic Japanese Garden,"Well manicured gardens created for the pleasure of the Shimazu ruling family of Satsuma (old Kagoshima).  You can recognize scenes from the Japanese docudrama ""Atsuhime"".  Views of Mt Sakurajima across the Kinko Bay as a backdrop to your photos are incredible.For foodies, try the toasted rice dumplings ""shinko dango or jambo mochi""  on bamboo skewers.  It's sweet and savory.  I can eat a whole plate by myself.   mmmmm"
Very cool,"There are some absolutely stunning gardens here, as well as trails up a wooded hillside.  Lots of nice water features.  Sakurajima is supposed to be part of the scenery, the gardens were laid out with the bay and the volcano in mind, but it was very cloudy the day we went, so we didn't get the landscaper's intended experience!  We could barely see the water, and couldn't see Sakurajima at all.  There is a ""residence"" in the garden that you can tour for an extra 500 yen, but part of that was sipping maccha at the end...I don't like maccha and have been in my share of edo jidai houses, so we passed.  The museum that's included in garden admission is small, but worthwhile.  The artifacts aren't exceptional, but the story told by the museum (counterclockwise from the entrance) through the labels and storyboards is well worth the visit."
Nice place to visit,"It's a nice place to visit in Kagoshima. Garden is very pretty including Sakurajima scenery.  However, since they hardly have  cherry trees, March was not a good month to visit. They were cleaning the garden to get ready for the golden week which is from ending of April to beginning of May. April to October should be more colorful and pretty. We enjoyed small museums adjacent to this garden."
Peaceful place!,"Go here and feel the tranqulity of a Japanese garden, and also have a great view across the bay to Sakurajima. Sometimes you may see the tea ceremony done here or hear traditional musicians at play. Nearby are also museums showing the influence from the West when they introduced some technology and engineering. Great area to spend time and relax."
WORTH A VISIT,We arrived a bit late but it is worth a visit and take your time to walk around and really explore the place. There is a lot to see so give yourself at least two hours. You can also have a tea crememony if you like.
A beautiful garden steeped in history,"Senganen is a lovely Japanese garden along the coast of Kinko Bay. The Shimadzu family built the garden and completed it in 1658.The garden is huge, about 50,000 sq metres, and has beautiful trees, waterfalls, streams, pavilions, shops, a shrine for cats (Nekogami Jinja), and a great view of Sakarajima.I took 90 minutes to walk around the garden and look at the interesting items in the shops.Two spots in the garden stood out for me - it was very inspiring looking up at the three huge Chinese characters (Senjingan) carved in the hillside and looking at Mt. Sakarajima spewing ash cloud across the bay."
worth to treck out to the garden,"very nice place to relax for a few hours, with nice views on the mountain. It was surprisingly popular, with lots of people there on a weekday morning. There are also lots of shops and restaurants, so a place to nibble a bit and try a few things. Overall, a nice activity in Kagoshima"
History and beauty,"We took the city view bus from Kagoshima-Chou station - we caught the bus which goes the long way round, which gave us a look at various points of the city. If you buy a one day pass you can hop on and off the bus and see the other sights, but we chose to just ride out to Senganen. There was a group of very happy friendly women working at the gate who made sure that we managed the ticket machines and that we got an English language brochure. Being the late Fall it is chrysanthemum season and there was a fantastic display of the flowers all through the garden - big ones, small ones, bonsai versions, mums covering buildings - flowers everywhere! The grounds of the estate are lovely, and at all times there is the presence of the volcano across the bay - Mt Sakurajima was visible, perfecting the experience of the grounds. The story of the estate, it's inhabitants and their position in Japanese history are all very interesting. There are many restaurants and gift shops on the grounds. The gift shops carry particularly high quality merchandise.When we left we took a different bus that returned via the waterfront and dropped us in the downtown shopping district. All in all, and interesting and entertaining excursion."
Definitely worth the time and effort~,"To say that it's a beautiful park is perhaps an understatement... I agree with the rest of the reviewers that it's a park filled with its own history.. Although I wasn't able to see the full view of Mt Sakurajima due to the (very stubborn clouds as it was raining quite heavily shortly before i'd reached senganen, it was nevertheless, still a magnificient sight... If u have the time to spare, do go for the hiking trail... I'm sure that the view up there would leave u, kinda, breathless..."
It is all about the view of Sakarajima,"On a tour of Japan it is easy to become blasé about the gardens. This one is larger than many but perhaps as a result seemed to lack that attention to detail that is such a feature of the most famous.But the location by the sea with the views across the straights to Mt Sakarajima is what for me it was all about and this did not disappoint. After exploring the garden we took the waterfall walk which involves 30 minutes or so of uphill walking along a path through semitropical forest before arriving at the viewpoint where a vista of the gardens, the sea and the volcano is spread out at your feet. The view of the waterfall framed by trees comes almost as an afterthought. This for us was the highlight of the garden.On a practical note the gardens are easily reached using the circular tour bus which departs from Kagoshima station. There are two rival companies which do not accept each others tickets, busses run every half hour throughout the day."
This Garden tells story,"Not just beautiful garden, but also carries big story about Japan turning to new ideas, opening to other countries."
gorgeous garden with history,"Despite visiting in pouring winter rain when the famous ""borrowed landscape"" view of Sakurajima was mostly shoruded in cloud, my family and I loved this garden.  The grounds are extensive and of course beautifully landscaped. Amazingly,the peonies were in full bloom (in January!) and charmingly protected from the weather in a way that exemplifies Japanese horticulture.  The history of the property, as recounted in the optional tour of the homestead, shone a light on the role Kagoshima played in the modernisation of Japan.  Fascinating.  There's also a huge restaurant with lovely views and a superior gallery/shop worth a look even if you're not in the market for top quality glass and ceramics."
Traditional Japanese garden,"Just another traditional garden.But the garden has a good view to Sakuragima island.If you like to walk and hike, the garden is good. You can see the museum before entrance to garden.The museum is good, too.If you will get there, you have to take a city view bus(fee=600 yen)"
"Lovely Park: Confluence of Nature, Culture, and History","This historical flower garden [also called Iso Flower Garden] is well preserved and developed. It is simply a delight to walk through its flowers, trees and shrubbery, water channels and ponds, shrines, and other architectural features. There are some stunning views of the Sakurajima volcano from many places in the garden. If you have more time available, there is an hour-long nature trail inside the garden, with even more spectacular views. A great place to sample some good tea and bean cakes. The City View Tour Bus stops here. A day-ticket for this bus (available at the information desks, or on the bus itself) will get you a discount for entering this flower garden."
