Tula State Museum of Weapons,"What shell I say , Simply amazing and great what they have done in Tula with this Museum . Incredible Museum in 4 levels , from historical weapons for hunting and war till the most modern weapons , guns and Tanks, Respect for this museum and all the effort they have done"
Amazing time,"Visit Tula on business travel , walked around the city, visit the guns & weppen museum , very interested the historic evolution."
Amazing Museum,"Visited the arms museum in Tula, Russia. Went with a group of 2 others and had an english translated tour. Very informative and one of the absolute best museums I've ever been to. Many different decades covered as well as many different types of weaponry. A definite must visit if going to Russia."
For gun/war lovers ,"If you're into wars, guns or military-related topics, you will love this museum. You can find the most famous weapons used throughout history in Russia. You can take part in shooting simulator. Didn't impress me, because I hate guns, but it's interesting. It's always good to learn something new"
Kalashnikovs. Check. Buks. Check. Stuff wolf. Check.,"Every Russian weapon of recent vintage on display and some going all the way back to old battle axes. Seemed to be family entertainment since it was a Saturday night and half the town seemed to be there with their enthralled. children, or boys, anyway."
Awesome! ,That is an awesome place! Must visit even if you are not fond of weapons. Interactive and you will not find rusty examples.
Comprehensive small arms history,"This is a newly rebuilt museum of small arms and Tula-made automatic cannons. Yes, some of products of KB Tochmash from Moscow are on display, but are much less annotated.Tula effectively owns Russian auto-cannon market with its GSh brand, so it is no surprise this brand is showcased more prominently.For firearms history buffs, like your truly, this museum offers a look into designs that competed with AK-47. See all the bullpups that never made it through trials. Browse displays with all the generations of AK down to the latest -12 and -15. An extensive exposition covers the history of Western arms, too. There are displays on WWI machine guns, on Browning handgun designs, and on antique muzzeloading firearms.Given the current (summer 2019) construction on M2 highway, the best way to visit from Moscow is to take early morning express train to Tula, and a cab to the museum, rather than spend couple of extra hours stuck on a highway reduced to a single lane. Couple that visit with a walk around Tula Kremlin, and you make a day trip out of it."
Museum,"The building of this museum is unique in its shape. There are several floors of exhibits, mostly arranged chronologically. There are a lot of old guns."
Touristic place,"Amazing storage of old weapon. 3 levels about guns, machine guns, rifles etc. Ticket costs 450 rubles per adult."
Amazing visit with English speaking guide!,"4 floors of 4 centuries of weapons, majority produced in Tula. We had a very nice tour with Margarita. She speaks fluently English and knows the museum very well. Must do in Tula! P.S. try the pies in the cafeteria, they are very tasty!"
Amazing experience,"Brand new building with ample parking nearby. Interesting exhibition, lots of things to see, they do have english speaking guides."
Pretty amazing,I am not a big fan of weapons but the museum was really interested.  Exhibits were well organized and our tour guide was great
"Lots to see - in a compact, user-friendly, and well-presented form",One of my (kids' :-) favorite weaponry museums. Some of the pieces are beautiful works of art; the layout and presentation are done almost impeccably. Lots of interesting historical info on Tula and Tula weaponry  works (TOZ). If you don't have much time - opt for a smaller (but still excellent) branch of the museum located on the grounds of Tula Kremlin.
Fun museum for all ages,"Moscow museums could learn some things from the Tula State Museum of Weapons - not only is the layout very well designed, but all the exhibits have information available in both Russian and English. The exhibits feature a nice diversity of old and modern weapons on display as well as more interactive features catering to younger visitors. The museum is relatively silent on the moral and human impact of the many weapons created in Tula, but that is perhaps a subject matter for a different museum."
Jewel in the Crown,"An extraordinary collection brilliantly set in a contemporary museum space. Solid information displays, in Russian and English.  Word on the street has it the new floor with displays on weaponry since WWII is now open.  Time for a return.  Tula offers a second collection, largely sporting firearms, at a smaller display within the charming and well-preserved kremlin.  An appealing community, the historical armoury of Russia since Peter the Great so designated this metal-working (samovar) centre around 1701.  The State Museum is, however, the jewel in this crown.  Enjoy!"
Very interesting collection of Russian weapons,A new building with middle age and mid 20th century weapons form Russia majorly form Tula.  very well placed and well explained.
A must location to visit,The Tula Arms Museum is a must place to visit while you are in Tula. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. The history of the arms factories in Tula is amazing. The gift shop is very nice and the snack bar area in great for a quick snack.
Up to date and interesting,"This is the new building of the Weapons museum, as of today (Nov. 2017) only two storeys of the exhibition space are open to public (plans for opening 3 more in Dec. 2017). The museum is packed with information: visual, audial, interactive, touch-screen labels with info on the exhibited objects. Unfortunately videos, displayed in the little movie-corners scattered around the space are subtitled in Russian, but maybe the Audioguide could help with this."
A place where men turn into little boys.,A very interesting Museum. A lot you can learn about the history of weapons. But perhaps the strongest impression I got at the stand of toy guns. When my husband took a shot of them for ten minutes and couldn't stop. And of course another shock this weapon under a microscope. Be sure to visit this Museum. You will get a lot of positive emotions.
Nice museum also see the companion museum inside the Kremlin,"As others have said this is a very nice museum with a couple floors concentrating on weapons produced in Tula (though there are weapons from other places as well).  The ticket for the main museum is 350 rubles for adults (children under 16 free), but for 550 you can get a combination ticket that also gets you admission to the other museum building which is inside the Kremlin wall.At the main building kids will enjoy the chance to try to hold a World War I rife and pistol in a fake trench.   Each of the exhibits has an ipad where you can get detailed descriptions (in Russian or English) of each of the weapons.  There is also play zone where for an extra fifty rubles kids can go in and use some equipment under supervision.  We did not try this but it look like the children would probably need to speak Russian to participate.   At the museum inside the Kremlin walls the first floor has hunting and ceremonial weapons, many of which are elaborately decorated.   The second floor has more ancient weapons from the 12-16th centuries.   to get from the first floor to the second their is  a stair at the back of the exhibit hall but than you need to exit the second floor from the other side,  just past the door of the main exhibit hall off to the right is a small room where you can hold a rife in a mock trench, or try on a Soviet Uniform.  You than exit down that staircase to the front of the museum.  This museum unlike the other building has almost no  English signage."
good collection of historical weapons,"very good collection of weapons dating from 17th century and up to date, good descriptions. situated in the city centre"
One of the best museums in our country,There were in this museum 3 times. Several floors and a lot of interesting things to see. There are virtual games for children. Films about the war. You can hold a weapon in your hands and take pictures
Great addition to the city,"The architecture of this building alone blows me away, also the landscape around it is pleasant to walk around on. The city cleared up the river along it well enough so that you can see this beauty when arriving/departing Tula by train. It's a great improvement for the city and will definitely drive more and more tourist in each year. The city is known for manufacturing weapons, and this is a perfect way to commemorate the contribution Tula made to Russia throughout history. Anyone who is into history will enjoy this, and people that are into military history and weapons will be thoroughly impressed. The displays are gorgeous, everything has comprehensive labels. The staff is alright, just your typical older ladies making sure you don't touch anything. PS, don't touch anything.. unless it says you can that is. The ladies are vigilant, and will stalk you around if they suspect you as a troublemaker, which I am not, Promise! Anyways, this is a museum that I would suggest taking a self-guided tour, and just take the time to focus on things that interest you most, as there is so much to see and it can get time consuming. Also note the little gazebo like thing near the river, its a good place to rest your legs and a perfect spot to capture a photo of the building."
"Weapons, weapons anf again weapons",If you are a group of 5 girls it would probably interesting for you but I'm not sure. We didn't have much fun. There are some multi-media things but that's it. Price didn't worth it.
modern and interesting,"new building fo the famous Arms museum. Innovative architecture and very interesting exposition, from ancient times to hi-tech new guns, etc. It'll be of joy and discovery both for children and adults."
Very modern and very interesting museum,Highly recommend to both youth and adults. A lot of cold and fire weapons exhibited. Very interesting multimedia set ups.
Modern miseum,It was attractive with a hugely detailed information about everything you wants to hear about war and especially history of weapons.
"Interesting, interactive exposition","We spent around 4 hours in this museum. It has a lot of latest and greatest electronic equipment, tablets, cool audio guides that are reading electronic labels and many computer games and holograms. it is one of the best contemporary museums that I've seen!"
interesting museum,"This a verry informative museum, it is in a total different set up than we see it in Western Europe.Modern building that shows many different weapon systems produced in the Tula area."
Nice museum ,There are so many kind of weapon!!! The museum has 5 floors of exhibits. There are a little bit interactive historical places and some funny things. On the first floor you can buy souvenirs.
Land of perfect weapons,"It must be the best museum I have ever visited, being a knowledge- thirsty -girl, I always want to widen my information. And the Tula state museum of weapon is the first place I taken first step when I was in Russian, and it worth much. Highly recommended this place, especially for some excursion."
Interesting,"Having visited the other weapons museum which was great, I expected this new one to be better.It wasn't but probably because it is still too new.At least they do have the language narrators which is a help, but only on a couple of floors at the moment.Very reasonable entrance fee and well worth a visit to kill a couple of hours."
"Interesting architecture to take photos outside, interesting arms inside","Another must-see place in Tula. Located near the Upa river, this museum is one of the favorite places to take photos by tourists and weddings. Inside you will find a lot of ancient and modern arms from Russia and other countries. One the first floor, near the entrance, you can buy some souvenirs and Tula gingerbreads."
Best Museum in Russia,"Very interactive, with outstanding collection of weapons.You can even hold some weapons in the trench model on third floor."
Brilliant museum!,"I excpected a stuffy and boring exhibition of weapons, in which I'm not particularly interested in, however I got a thrilling and entertaining exhibition. The museum is very well designed, with many interactive pannels, hands-on sections and lots of information provided on the electronic pannels. Good gift-shop as well. I was surprised in the best possible manner.My thoughts after visiting this museum were the following: Who had thought it all out and my, he should come to Moscow to do something about the Red Army and Zoological museums..."
interesting for men,"this museum is nearby to the Kremlin. No doubts, it would be interesting for men )) but it can be useful for women too"
If you have nothing better to do...,"I'd normally love this kind of place but for some reason wasn't impressed. There are many displays but not a lot in the way of information of historical context. Since there is not much else on offer in Tula, this may be best bet if in town, especially with kids."
Best weapons collection,This museum is situated now in 2 buildings. One is the temple inside Tula Kremlin and their is the main part of exposition. The other is new museum building behind the Upa river. In future all will be combined in new building.The weapons collection is excellent and you can spend few hours to exam it. There are as guns as cold weapons created through hundred of years beginning from 16th century.It must be seen if you are guested in Tula.
Very good quality for a provincial museum,The museum has moved to a new building across the river and at the time of writing only two full floors out of a total of five are open. As such they only have a limited part of their collection on display but it is very good and interesting. One floor has 1800s - modern era weapons which is not too interesting unless you are a real gun nut but the main historical floor is interesting in - it provides an interesting insight into the history of Russia rather than being just a bunch of guns/swords/armour. The pieces are of very high quality.
Very interesting museum,";Been there three or four times, with different guests each time. Interesting and well presented, from the Middle Ages to 2000s. Focus on Russian weapons of course, but many collections of European, American and Asian weapons. My favorite are big navy heavy weapons at the end :-)"
Tula Bragging Rights,The museum reviews the history of Tula as a main source of weaponry to WWII.  The citizens of Tula are very proud of the fact that was never occupied by German forces during WWII in spite of the fact it was nearly surrounded and encompassed during that foray.   My friends were requested to step aside when young Russian military personnel were brought to be oriented in the older Russian arms.
great collecton of weapons,"Tulas was very well known for their manufacturing of arms from 1712 serving anyone who ruled RUssia. The museum was moved to a new building that has a shape of a helmet. There are all kinds of pistols, rifles and knives on display. Very nicely set up. A very interesting museum for those who like to look at weapons."
