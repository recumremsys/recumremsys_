Great View,Big part of our day trip tour to Mount Wellington. A fun day with stunning views and enjoyable walks.
Not a road less travelled,Went to show the visitors the view... The road up the mountain really needs an upgrade. Our tourists were sure they were going to die when one car took a corner a little too widely.
Wonderful Views,"The drive up the mountain is a little scary if it raining or snowing, but once there, the views are incredible and well worth the journey. Must do experience when visiting Hobart!"
Brilliant on a clear day and amazing in winter,Easy to travel up to and outstanding views all round. Great place to picnic and enjoy the panorama and views of Hobart and the Huon valley and across to the eastern shore
Night photography ,"Quite windy and cold but plenty of people still braving the weather, luckily we spent most of the time inside the shelter.  Plenty of wildlife so be careful driving, good views to be had on a clear night."
Superb Views,This is a must visit from Hobart. The views here were stunning. There are various viewpoints and so many photo opportunities. Also saw some wildlife up here.
Great view of the city,Definitely worth a quick trip. It has a beautiful view every looking the city. There are also some great trails to hike!
Beautiful place ,Lovely drive to the top of the mountain. Amazing views but wowsers you will need some warm clothes. It was freezing and so windy. Next time I’d wear my hair up so I can see more clearly without looking like Cousin It.
On Top of the World,"The summit of Mount Wellington looks nearer than it actually is but the twenty to thirty-minute drive is well worth it.  You can drive your own car to the summit, or you can get a local bus.  Some hotels take shuttle buses up there and of course, other tour operators take tours to the summit also. You may also decide to park halfway up and walk the rest of the way but I would only advise this if you are an experienced walker and are prepared for such an adventure.The road is windy in places and care should be taken driving up the summit road, especially if it has been raining or snowing.  At the summit, there is plenty of parking and it's worth taking warmer clothing as it is considerably cooler up there whatever the season.  There is an indoor viewing platform with several interesting stories displayed of people who have ascended Mount Wellington on foot.  The best viewing platforms, however, are outside and there are several of these, accessible by steps and ramps.  The views are spectacular unless of course there is low cloud, and while you may set off on a beautiful sunny clear day, there is always the chance of a lonely cloud drifting by to spoil the view!  The views are easily some of the best I have seen taking in the sea, coves and bays, the city of Hobart and mountain ranges all around.  I have only ever been to the top of Mount Wellington in the day time but you can go up there at night time too and I guess the view would be amazing in a completely different way."
Awesome lookout over Hobart,"Was very cold & windy during our visit - Awesome lookout over Hobart, good to see a nice weather shelter with informative posters, toilets etc. Fairly easy access, well worth visiting for a look."
mount wellington,stunning view of Hobart and behind. you need a clear day otherwise encased in cloud a must see if weather good. Need warm clothes
Good views,Interesting drive to the top. Gives great view of Hobart and the harbour. Remember to rug you tho as does get breezy up there
Cold and windy mountain,"Headed up the hill on Sunday morning but only got as far as Ferntree due to a bicycle race, so down to Margate Beach for breakfast (terrific). Finally got to head up to the peak around 11am and the drive is not for the faint hearted - narrow road and steep drops on the side. Got to the top where the wind was blowing at about 40knots and the temperature had dropped remarkably (to 10 c). Great views but not a place for t shirts and shorts."
Stunning viewpoint from the observatory.,"On a cold, wet & very windy day we were driven to the top of Mount Wellington. Good job as apart from the freezing cold & driving rain the gusts of wind were approaching gale force it seemed. Once in the observatory all is forgiven. Allowed to dry out & warm up, the views are incredible. There is a telescope provided which helps. As a free attraction I would strongly recommend it."
Depends on the weather,"We were looking forward to the views from the top and enjoyed the drive up, stopping once or twice to look at the city below.  Unfortunately, before we were able to reach the summit the weather closed in and the view was lost in a cold, damp cloud.  Try to go when the sun shines."
Spectacular view,"It is a very windy road but definitely worth the drive for the amazing views. It was absolutely freezing the day we were there so you need lots of layers of clothing, wind cheater, beanie etc."
Great trip,"We booked the express coach trip which was 2 hours including 50 mins at the top. At minus 2 degrees and 96kph gusts we didnt need the full 50 mins! But worth it for the views, stunning"
Definite Must Visit,"Be it summer or winter, definitely rug up when heading up.The views are spectacular!There a places to stop either along the way up or down to soak in the views if traveling up by car. A definite must visit whilst in Hobart!"
WELL WORTH THE DRIVE UP HERE,It is much cooler on Mount Wellington but well worth the drive and the view from the top.. There is an observatory and several boardwalks from which you can view the city below.
Wild weather added to the great experience!,"We took a drive up the windy road to enjoy panoramic views. How quickly the weather changes, fortunately we had the clothing to handle it. It is worth a drive. Interestingly Mount Wellington was at some early stage called Table Mountain ; when you get up there the terrain and flora has a most similar look and feel about it"
Must go on a clear day,"If Mt Wellington has even the slightest cloud cover then don't go up to the top as you won't be able to see a thing but if it is clear then the views from up there are the most amazing that I have seen. It is a very steep, narrow and winding road to get there but it is worth it. It is free and you should go if you get the chance."
Beautiful Views.,"Travelling to the top of mount wellington by car is easy, there is ample parking at the summit, and the views all around are stunning."
Amazing views over Hobart,"A half hour steep drive up from Hobart  on a winding road with fantastic views from the various viewing platforms. Good free parking and toilets. Would strongly suggest not starting out on this trip unless you are more or less certain that the clouds are much higher than the 4000ft summit. There is a brief history of the early settlers and explorers who visited the island and walked/climbed to the summit. Coach trips from Hobart are possible and if you are a keen cyclist bikes can be  loaded on the back of the buses to enable a free wheel descent, for the real enthusiast you can cycle up as well!"
Fascinating visit after snow in March,"I enjoyed the coach tour of Hobart which started with a visit to the top of Mt Wellington. At the top there was some ice on the shrubs and plants, as well as little icicles on the wooden railings. There was some fog which obscured most of the view of Hobart but it looked mysterious and fascinating. I hadn't anticipated such a  wintry sight as it was only March. I loved the big boulders on the top of the mountain and enjoyed the whole trip."
6 degrees below but 1271 metres above,"A beautiful sunny day, awesome days climb and spectacular view from the roof of Hobart.  Take the time to hike the Mountain and you will enjoy it even more than a drive."
A long road for a great view,"Very long and winding road, but still ok in a small campervan - wouldn't do in a large one!Fantastic views at the top though sadly very windy and cloudy on arrival.  So worth it and a must do if you have transport.  There were many visitors as well as small bus tours around."
Mountain above Hobart,A short drive up to Mt Wellington from Hobart a nice quiet drive up hill. Unfortunately the top was in cloud from the weather so we didn’t get to see much but it was still a good visit. We did see lots of Hobart on the drive up and down since the lower parts weren’t in cloud so could imagine what the view would be like from the top! Well set out with walking platforms and a nice glass building to get inside from weather. Best to go on a sunny day but we ran out of time. Will go again when next in Tasmania. Would be great to have a coffee shop built up there in the future.
An amazing climb by the coach to the top of Mt Wellington,Well worth the money as you then get a proper idea of the lay of the land around Hobart which helped us a lot.The summit was packed with people but again well worth the walk around
There’s no sunshine on a cloudy day,Limited opportunities to see a view. Only a small number of stopping bays/look outs. Picnic area/coffee shop has no view. No point to visit the summit on a cloudy day as it is above the clouds. Very good parking area and viewing decks at the summit but nothing to see on a cloudy day. Accessible by bus and car.
Beautiful view and scenic drive ,"Such a beautiful view, the drive there from Hobart was very beautiful and scenic. A must see when in Tasmania."
Respect!,"This is what kunyani looks like on a day when the weather is unpredictable. Cloudy one minute, completely closed in the next! A beautiful place to be anyway. Just rug up warmly."
Interesting view point,"Worthwhile going, especially if the weather is good. Very windy and cold up there, so take along warm clothes. Well maintained for visitors with the in room outlook to protect you from the stiff and cold wind. Easy to walk around and when we were there sufficient car parking. We enjoyed it very much"
Spectacular view!,Freezing yet beautiful 🥶🥶 was definitely worth the drive up the mountain...take a moment to breath in the beauty!
Such a great view!,"I love that you’re able to drive all the way up by yourself and don’t have to rely on transport or a long hike to see the sights. It’s freezing at the top, though, so bring appropriate clothing. It really gives you such a stunning view of Hobart and the surroundings. The drive up is enjoyable as well, such gorgeous scenery."
Beautiful Views,"Beautiful breath taking view of Tassie, able to see as far as the eye can travel. Make sure you go on a day that there is no cloud around."
Stunning views,Freezing cold on the day but an amazing views. Lots of people visiting. Roads a little scary at times.
Must do,A great location. The views of the surrounding area are amazing. A long way up and very cold so make sure you are suitably attired.
Great experience,"A must do when in Hobart, Mt Wellington is incredibly beautiful and varied in its landscape. We caught shuttle up to top and walked down. The view at top is amazing and the walk down through the natural terrain was really special. A reasonable level of fitness required as down a steep decent put quite a strain on my 54yo yoga fit leg muscles.. not on the climb, but the next few days after. Totally recommend:)"
Beautiful vista of Hobart,"Because of the overcast weather, our tour guide was able to take us only half-way up Mt Wellington. Nevertheless, the panarama was wonderful."
Great views on a clear day,Great views but need a clear day. Well worth the effort to take the trip up from Hobart and allow and hour or so the enjoy the views.
"Windy road, but view is worth it (if fine)","The road up to Mt Wellington has lots of twists and turns, and is steep, would not like to get stuck behind a bus or slow-moving vehicle. Checked the live webcam and saw it was fairly clear so went then. Had a really nice view over Hobart and the Derwent until the clouds rolled in. Well-built boardwalks and paths. Very picturesque."
Mountain View’s. ,A very tight windy road up to the summit of the mountain. The drive is exciting in its own right. Up top you have magnificent views of hobart and the Derwent River.  Don’t ever go up on a cloudy day as all you will see is white.  A must do part of any trip to Hobart Tasmania.
Mountain views of Hobart,A very tight windie road to the summit. The ride itself is exciting. The views up top are wonderful - both of Hobart and also Derwent.  If it’s a cloudy day don’t bother as you will only see white and be very disappointed. Otherwise this is a must see location.
WHAT I CALL A ROAST MEAL.,"WHAT I CALL A ROAST MEAL.What I am going to show you is what I call a roast meal cooked by my lovely wife of 58 years.There is not to much meat but proper roast potatoes (just crispy) carrots, sucinnni, tomato plus gentally boiled silverbeet and gravy + pepper to pamper my pallet. A glass of whit wine did not go amiss.This took about 20 minutes to savour and totally enjoy.Below, I show our view of Mount Wellington, my roast before and after my meal.kypainting"
Beautiful lookout.,"Beautiful lookout, If you visited Hobart, this is one of your must do attractions. Its bit cold up there, so pack your warm clothes with you."
"Take warm clothes, watch for vague tourists driving in your lane","Finally a clear day to head up here, worth the trip.  We dodged the majority of vistors on the way up by approaching from a different road.  Amazing views when the sky is clear!  A bit to read too whilst up there but most history is online.  Be warned though, many tourists from overseas drive their hire cars up here and are not familiar with tight roads and the vehicle they are in.  We had a number of close calls as they get scared of their left wheels near the edge of drains and tarmac.  Otherwise, a worthy trip up the 51st highest mountain top in Tasmania."
A Must when in Hobart,We chose was seemed like a nice day in Hobart to drive to the summit of Mount Wellington. Unfortunately the top half of the mountain was shrouded in cloud and drizzle and was very cold and windy. We descended to the mid station below the cloud where the views were still spectacular and it was warm enough to walk about and have a coffee. A must when visiting Hobart and easy to do if you have a hire car like we did.
Bicycle tour,"Bus up the mountain, freewheel down!Great way to see the scenery. Very exciting at times! Loved it."
Such a beauty,"Loved Mt Wellington, go on a lovely warm clear day! Skys were blue and welcoming, such a lovely view! & FREE - a must do. Try the cafe on the way up"
High on the hill,"At the bottom of the hill to the mountain there is a warning and sign to indicate if the road is open, a winding road to the top and a big carpark with breathtaking views of Hobart and the Derwent River"
A 'Must Do' When in Hobart.,Just don't miss an opportunity to go up Mt Wellington. Best views of Hobart and surrounding landscape. Lovely wild flowers along the way especially in Spring. Feels like the top of the World. Sheltered Lookout and Info & Rest Rooms but no Café as yet. Really worth the time to go and see.
Amazing view,A must see attraction while visiting Hobart. Freezing cold and extremely windy so take something warm but omg the view is amazing. Well worth the drive up. If you are into hiking there are plenty of different tracks to choose from.  Enjoy :)
Great view of Hobart,"Drive up a steep narrow road. Plenty of parking, lots of different vantage points to take pictures.Also stops along the way to take more pictures."
What a view of the Derwent,"If the day, morning or evening is free of cloud this is a must do when visiting Hobart.  You get 360 degrees views of the Hobart area. There are some walk around the top and selective ones to get to the top."
Stunning view and lots of walks,"No matter if you are into walking, on a clear day, the view is absolutely stunning and you can drive to the very top and park your car in a pretty large car park. From short walks on the top and in between, to long hikes that lead from top to bottom of the mountain (or vice versa), you will find a suitable walk for yourself.Best chance to see Hobart from another perspective."
Wonderful views on a sunny February day,"We took the bus up and back, passing some brave souls on bikes and on foot. It is quite steep! When you get to the top there are fabulous views from various lookout points. It can be quite windy, so it’s worth taking a jacket, even on a sunny day."
Boys trip,"Well worth a drive, not far from Hobart and the views are amazing. Can get very cold up there make sure you pack a coat"
Worth the effort,"Amazing views, beautiful landscape and excellent facilities. I am scared of heights, so did not venture too far out onto the walkway, but still a beautiful site"
Good views ,Been up here before 16 years ago but then it was cloudy. Today it was cold but crystal clear.  Great views over Hobart and the Derwent river.
Look for clear sky before you head up the mountain.,"The drive up the mountain says it all, up, up and away! The cloud cover can blow in before you get to the top, nil visibility on the day we went due to a short time in the city, but worth it. Remember how high you are going and take the coat and hat. Worth the challenge."
Stunning views ,Great views and not too far of a drive from Hobart cbd. There are toilets there but not much else at the top. We expected some more walking tracks. Views are stunning and a nice local trip.
Mount Wellington has lovely views,"we are fortunate that an ealry 20th century governor had a road built up Mount Washington, so that cars, buses and coaches can ascend and give mnay the beneoft of the lovely views down across the city and surrounding area, recahing to the mountains of central Tasmania on a clear day.  It can get busy on a good weekend."
Spectacular views,A great drive to teh summit with spectacular views over Hobart. Although we visited in January (summer) the summit was windy and very cold at 7 degrees so the viewing building was really appreciated. Rug up for your visit.
Amazing view,"The view from Mt Wellington was amazing. The drive up the mountain was scary in parts but quite ok overall and well worth it when you arrive. Take in the views, the history, the cool and the clouds all part of how high up you are.Tasmania is such a pretty place."
Amazing Views,There are a lot of times that the mountain in shrouded in cloud so if you can see it go there! The views are spectacular. The road is a bit hairy so if not a confident driver there are lots of shuttle buses that go up there.
Beautiful views,Took a tour bus from Hobart to the Pinnacle at Mount Wellington and would highly recommend. Beautiful views down to Hobart CBD and surrounds
Wrap up but worth the view,It is much cooler on the mountain but worth the effort. We were lucky enough to have a clear crisp day. Views were outstanding.
views,"well worth the awkward trip up, magnificent views of hobart but can be very windy and cold so wrap up. unfortunately due to short sighted council theres still no cable car or facilities at the top... hardly believable it should be a must visit tourist spot"
graet when it is clear,Sadly we chose a cloudy day but Dave our driver certainly helped us make the most of it. He really went out of his way to make the journey memorable and we finally found a great and clear lookout on the way down. Well done Dave you are an asset to your company
"Terrific Views of Hobart, Bruny Island, Tasman Sea",It's a long way up but worth it for the great views of the area. Beware of taking pictures inside the overlook. You often get window reflections in the picture.
God’s personal painting!,"Wow wow and WOW! If you are in Hobart this is one place you should most truely visit. Personally Mt. Wellington is my favourite place in Australia. It is so peaceful up there and the air is so pure. I took an Uber from Hobart cbd but you can always take a bus there but have to keep in mind about the return bus. Luckily the uber driver who took us was kind and a friendly who decided to hang with us and took us back too. There are many view points to look into the city but I was a little cheeky and went really into the hills. If you’re a nature lover like me, you should definitely walk into the hills and explore the real Mt. Wellington. 110/100!"
Must go! ,Must-go place when in Tasmania. One can easily reach the peak by car. Road is highly accessible too. Worth the view.
Fabulous views on a clear day,A twenty minute drive up a winding  but good road from Hobart the views on a clear day are fabulous. Plenty of parking and walkways and vantage points ensure you get that perfect picture.
"Scenic views of Hobart, worth the visit",We drove here from Hobart. Nice drive with little bends and curves up the mountain (good for people with travel sickness).  The mountain has toilets and a beautiful lookout across Hobart.  Photos don't really don't it justice. You get a real sense of how large the Derwent River is.  There are history plaques around the lookout which outlines the history of climbers/hikers and settlement. Try and pick the day you go. The mountain is usually in cloud cover which inhibits the view. The mountain lookout attracts a lot of tourists and buses. We went around lunch time and avoided the crowds. The Cascade Brewery is at the base of the mountain which is a good place to visit after the Mountain. Recommended whist in Hobart.
Clear with snow,"Went up the top on a clear cold morning & there was still snow about. Views sensational, information centre great (& sheltered)."
Excellent place to visit on a good day when in Hobart.,We drove up to Mount Wellington and it is an easy drive with car parking on the summit. Very good facilities and well worth it to see the superb views all around. A ‘must’ to visit if staying at Hobart
Amazing views,The drive up Mount Wellington is an adventure but so worth it when you reach the top!The view is so amazing!Warmer clothes are necessary because on Mt. Wellington the temperature is on average 8 °C colder than Hobart CBD.
Stunning Views,I had the opportunity to visit on a clear day in February. After a winding drive up to the summit we got out to find the most sensational views over Hobart and surrounds. Well worth the trip up on a clear day.
Pete’s place of the day ,A trip to Hobart is not complete till you travel up the mountain. At 1271 meters you get a fantastic view on a clear day and also notice the temperature drop
Beautiful landmark ,Mount Wellington serves as a major landmark when visiting Hobart Tasmania. Majestic views of the harbor and surrounding vineyards.
Wow!,Drive up was a little harrowing but well worth it in the end. Spectacular views and informative displays.Went on a clear day and you can see for miles. Not too busy and amenities available
Can say we went,"Cloudy day, foggy up top, could not see city but had a view half way down. Shame the driver was a right pain"
Get above the Cloud’s!,We travelled up the mountain in overcast weather.It was fun to transition from dark sky’s to the top of the mountain where we were above the clouds with clear sky’s.Kids enjoyed the area while adult learnt a bit more about the area.Was a short trip but enjoyable for all.
"Great view, great hiking",Well marked trails and scenery make this a great place close to Hobart for a day trip. Facilities are along the trail so very civilized hiking.
A must visit in Hobart,"I have to say that Mt Wellington is definitely a must visit attraction when travelling to Hobart. We drove to the top for a spectacular view of the Hobart city, there are also some trails for tracking if time permits."
"Brrrrr, but brilliant","It was quite cloudy as we headed up and didn't think we would see very much but after getting to the top for a very brisk walk to the viewing platform the clouds seemed to part only for a few moments and the view was great.Got a couple of quick snaps before almost jogging back to the car. Take all the layers, beanies, scarves and gloves. It was absolutely freezing up the top!Lots of sharp corners, take the drive slow."
Must do in Hobart ,"Excellent views over Hobart and beyond. Look out for Wallabies and echidna. It was very cold, so make sure you take a jacket and beanie."
Great views over Hobart and the surrounding areas,"We did this as part of the Mt Field, Bonorong and Richmond day trip from Hobart.  The views over Hobart and the surrounding areas are terrific on a good clear day and are well worth the effort to getting there."
A must do,"The view is simply fantastic you won't get any better than this. Would highly recommend, try to pick a clear day as weather will determine your view"
Stunning views,We drove up (can’t imagine biking) and the views were incredible.  Highly recommend it.  Dress warmly.
Extremely windy and cold,"We went on a sunset tour which was really easy and organised. The drive up in daylight is interesting as you wind around and across the mountain but when you reach the top, the views are amazing. However, I cannot stress how windy and cold it is. In January (summer) the temperature was 7 degrees Celsius and the wind was gusting at 130 kph. You need extremely warm windproof gear. I would definitely do this again (with the right gear next time). There is a glass sheltered space where you can view the whole city but the sunset is on the other (unsheltered) side of the mountain and the wind comes straight off the Antarctic."
Great day out,I was travelling alone and found the $30 shuttle bus option great value. Beautiful drive up with interesting local commentary and the view from the top is great. The timing was great as well- 40-50 minutes at the top just gives you enough time to see everything and get some good photos. We were lucky that it wasn’t too windy on that day but make sure you pick something warm as it is usually 12 degrees cooler up at the top than in town.
Great View,"Really good to visit, great view of Hobart. Wear warm clothes. It was freezing the middle of Summer. Take the bus tour. The driver was great."
Breath taking views,Well worth the long coach ride up the road. Absolutely beautiful views of Hobart. Check the weather first. It’s usually 15 degrees cooler at the top. Also if it’s cloudy or rainy you’re wasting your time going up there.
Excellent mountain top views of Hobart,Must go to climbing the mountain top of Wellington in Hobart and you can see the beautiful views of the whole city Hobart under your feet even very strong wind over there.Make sure you bring your warm clothes and drinks with snacks and enjoy your safety rocks climbing selflessness.
a highlight of my Hobart visit,"Leaving from the Information Centre in Hobart at 1pm we arrived 50 minutes later on Mount Wellington, 1270m asl and about 10° C cooler than down by the sea. It was a small bus from the Hobart Shuttle Bus Company with a knowledgeable und funny driver. All in all we spent another 50 minutes on top, which was enough to walk around and have good views over Hobart and the Derwent River as well as towards the flatter backside. Interesting were also the rock formations, eroding a bit like granite, but it was another subvolcanic rock, a dolerite, what in the USA would be called a 'diabase'. Around it and sometimes covering it was a struggling tundra-like vegetation with mainly lichens.Besides the Pinnacle Observation Shelter, reached on a boardwalk, there is also a Telecommunications Facility, to which there is no access. There are toilets."
Breathtaking view,I just loved mount Wellington. The view from trop of it simply breathing. Heard the sunset is just mesmerizing which I hope to in near future.Carry extra layer(s) as it could be very windy and chilly over there and might drizzle/rain up there.
Great view of Hobart and Surround,"About 35 min outside Hobart. Great view of Hobart and Surround, worth the windy drive up the mountain.Its about 10 degrees colder than Hobart (see attached photo)"
Nice view of Hobart,Bit of a winding toad up the mountain but the views are worth itSome nice tracks around and a boardwalk for the less adventurous
Must be seen,Fantastic view at 1200meters.Possibility to drive to top.Roughly 10°C less than in Hobart.Possibility to park all along the road and walk to top.
Beautiful drive up the Mountain,"We took a drive up to Mount Wellington one morning.  It was a lovely drive up the mountain even though it was a bit windy. and narrow.   It was worth the drive up as when you get to the top the views are amazing.   The clouds were very low so some of the views were obstructed.  It was very cold on top of the mountain, so remember to bring a scarf and jacket when going up.   I would probably not go there in the morning again, I would wait until later in the afternoon once the clouds have disappeared.   There is a lovely rest area up there with nice bathroom facilities so you don't have to stop on the side of the road to pee."
Superb views,We drove up to Mt Wellington. It was super windy but has stunning views of Hobart and surrounding. Definitely recommend visiting
Great for a short hike,Have limited time but want to get the local flavor?  This is it.  35 minutes from downtown and lots to choose from.  I can personally recommend Lost World and Old Hobartian tracks.
aeroplane like views over town for free!,amazing view and its free! try to make sure you get up here. easy in ur own car and probably a bus also?
breezy,"Great drive up to the point of Mt Wellington,plenty of accessible parking, Ensure you take a coat, because even on a sunny day in Downtown Hobart, There is a cool breeze blowing up on the mountain.Great pictures to be got, on a clear day - beautiful outlook."
Fantastic views,"Interesting drive along winding roads, plenty of parking, good information boards and amazing views."
Stunning 360 Views from the Top,"We took the auto tour to the top of Mt Wellington on a beautiful clear blue sky day. Views at the top were absolutely breathtaking. There are several lookouts at different locations at the top so you can take advantage of views of Hobart, the bays, ocean and surrounding farmland and forest. Worth the 10 km drive on a very narrow 2-way road to the top. This is an outstanding free activity especially on a day with good weather."
Quick trip up the mountain ,"Quite a long drive from where we were staying in Dodges Ferry, but not far from the centre of Hobart.Nice easy drive up the mountain, with great stopping points on the way.Good viewing points at the top and information boards in the viewing area.Walking route options listed at the top looked good, probably no fun with toddlers."
Mt Wellington with Grey Line,This was a mini-bus tour with a local driver. This is ideal if you wish to take your time.We had sufficient time at the top which we last visited in 1974. On the way back we had a look at the former Cascade Women's Factory.Recommend you go with Grey Line.
You need warm clothes,We had to wait a day for the wind to change direction before we could visit because of the smoke.  The 360 view from the top was magnificent. We could see the whole of Hobart and the river right down to the sea. A perfect place to start a visit to Hobart and Tasmania.
Stunning view from Mt Wellington,"This is a must do for visitors to Hobart although you do have to cross your fingers that the weather is good. The road up the mountain is a bit intimidating and if you don't like heights, don't look down. the view from the top was stunning the day we were there even though there was still a bit of smoke around. Take the time to read up on the geology, it is fascinating in itself.  !"
WOW,The view from the top is just amazing.One of the most beautiful locations and views in entire Tasmania.We would definitely say: you can live Tasmania without going on the top of the Mt.
More for cyclists or mountain hiking,"We drove up to mountain top, it was a very winding road,  a bit narrow for both directions. A busy roads with cyclists, cars, coaches. On a beautiful day, it is ok. I can imagine if rainy and snow season, it could be dangerous. Suggest check the road open before heading up in extreme weather. It could be closed.Up on the top, no restaurants or any shops. Viewer platform, you can climb up to lime rock, but pls follow the rules. The local is against the cable car, otherwise it could add more attractions. Not a fun place to me."
Mt Wellington,So worth it. Took hop on hop off bus. Really good deal. Beautiful views. Commentary on the bus was great. We had half an hour to roam at the top. Just right.
Location location ,"We planned to be there for sunset,  but the sun had other ideas. Nonetheless the views were magnificent. Looking down through the clouds is amazing, so well worth getting there before dark. Dress warm & wear walking shoes, as there is a fair amount of boardwalk, plus the Pinnacle if you want to climb the rocks. The road up is bumpy & unlit."
Spectacular views. ,Surprised by the incredible views and a variety of choice of options at the top of the mountain. It would have been great to have had a description and some detail on the significant radio mast on top of the mountain. I left the top of the mountain not knowing what that was all about. Views fantastic though. Essential to go up when visibility is good.
Mt  Wellington,A sight well worth visiting. It offers a majestic view and many photo opportunities. There are various points you can stop off and savour the beauty but make sure you continue to the very top. You won’t be disappointed.
"Freezing cold, even in summer - bring your winter clothes! ","Given that Tasmania is already quite cool, and Mt Wellington is at least 10 degrees cooler, it was 8 degrees on the mountain when we went in the middle of summer. Even the wallabies had a fluffier looking coat. And apparently the echidnas have a fluffy layer under their spikes up here too to keep warm. Sadly it was a foggy/overcast day and it looked like we drove into clouds so there wasn't much to see in terms of views. However, it was still pretty cool (no pun intended) to walk around, and on the way down you can stop by the side of the road and see some views of the city. There's also a toilet up the top and an enclosed look out where you can take shelter if it is too cold and windy outside."
Beautiful!,This is definitely worth doing in Hobart! Beautiful views and a scenic drive! It’s worth going to the very top.
"Fantastic location, but obviously weather dependent ","We visited on a hazy Wednesday morning. The drive up to the top is on tight, twisty mountain edge roads. Very picturesque, but to be driven carefully. Once at the top, there is ample parking and fantastic panoramic views. Due to the day we visited, our visibility was limited, but still great views. If you visit on the right day, they would be stunning!"
Mount Wellington ,"A 30 minute drive from Hobart, we left at 9am and we only passed 1 car coming the other way. It was quite cloudy on the summit and there was smoke haze, but it was still worth the drive. We didn’t think the temperature drop was an issue in summer and we got away with a jumper and shorts. A very beautiful mountain."
A must do!,Very rarely does one get the chance to see such an incredable site from such a well maintained site. The view of Hobart and all the surrounding areas is breathtaking.
Amazing. ,We spent a good few hours once we finally got to the top.  Quite a drive to reach the top.  A little disappointed that there was so much smoke haze from the bushfires but that couldn’t be helped.  So beautiful views to be see and lots of interesting bits of i formation placed around for people to look at. Toilets were disappointing as someone had not used one correctly and there was quite a mess.  This was not the cleaners faults as only cleaned 30 minutes prior to us arriving.  There was no soap to wash your hands properly.
Breathtaking,"The drive up was a little nerve wracking but the view was lovely. It was a clear summer day for us, slightly smoky from fires but still great views. Slight breeze and was cool up top."
Great a View but soooooo Cold,The view from on top is great really it’s high up. But when the wind is up it’s sooooooooo cold. We went from 28° in the city to 6° and that’s not accounting for wind chill - it was truly freezing.
Beautiful View of Surrounding Area,"The top of Mt Wellington has great views of Hobart and the surrounding areas.  In addition, if you are there after a rain showe as we were, r you might be able to see a rainbow from the top."
Mount Wellington summit kunanyi,A friend and I drove spontaneously up to the springs carpark on a sunny day from where we had hiked up mount Wellington on the Pinnacle Track 591m up. It took us 2 1/2 hours because we did lots of stops for photos. It’s a really nice track to hike up.
Panoramic views,"Visiting Mt Wellington is a must. The drive is about 20 minutes from the CBD and it’s such a nice drive (however, be careful on the narrow road up the mountain)!Once you get up there enjoy the views it’s magnificent and will not disappoint. Take warm clothes as the wind can be chilly."
I was petrified!!,"I’m Sure this was an amazing view and a fabulous place for tourists to visit when in Hobart - however for anyone who is afraid of heights and suffers vertigo, the drive up to the top and back down was absolutely  terrifying!!! It wasn’t like any lookout I have been to before - the road up Mt Wellington winds up the side of the mountain with sheer drops to death just off the edge of the road. There is not much of a guard rail to speak of (rope held up my tooth picks ready to be plucked out of the road when hit!). I am sure that most people love this place - this is just a warning for those scaredy cats like me!!"
Disabled travellers can enjoy view from observatory,"The view is amazing from the observatory.  Although as disabled traveller, I cannot go out to some of the boardwalk as there are steps, I still can enjoy the view from the observatory.  Same reminder - remember to bring enough clothings to keep warm, even though you might feel warm in Hobart.  As you go up the mountain, the temperature can go down by more than 10 degrees."
Bring your cardigan,"There is only one rule for Mount Wellington summit...Bring a warm top and wear long pants as it's cold and windy. It offers beautiful views of Hobart. Accessible by car, bike or for the very keen on foot. There is parking at the summit but it can be a bit of a wait for a free space. There are viewing area's and one of the areas is enclosed and sheltered, handy for those people who wear summer outfits."
One day trip,Wonderful views & stature . The weather was windy however it was worth as the views were tremendous.
Amazing views,The drive up is windy and narrow in places but very accessible.  It is well worth it to see the views across the city. Windy up there even on a nice day- take a jumper!
The view is amazing.10/10,"We love this  place. All times of the year it is so inviting it draws you back over and over again. It does get chilly up there though, it can be 10 degrees cooler at the lookout then in Hobart so dress accordingly. But worth the effort."
Spectacular views,"We had our own vehicle to drive up to Mount Wellington.  The drive itself is interesting. You realise you are going high as the weather changes as you are driving up.  The day we went it was extremely windy and cold once we got to the top so we did not stay long.  Rushed to be inside the building at the top so we could enjoy the views of Hobart in comfort, which were spectacular."
Great Views,This was the last stop on our tour and a gamble whether the weather would be good enough to see anything. As it was we had snow and strong winds but the clouds parted to allow some spectacular views of Hobart. A plus was on the drive up we spotted a wild echidna.
Very interesting visit,Going to the Mount Wellington is like going to another place very far grom Hobart.Actually when you go up the weather changes completely as it become very windy and foggy and of course also much more colder.When we up it was almost impossible to stay longtime outside because it was really cold. Anyway there is a building where you can have a magnificent panorama on Hobart and so if it is cold it is always possible to go inside this building.
Great walks and MTB trails,"We started at The Springs and took the North South Trail to Glenorchy MTB park and return.  The track is physical with quite a lot of rocks and bumps, and a long, hard uphill on the way back, but it’s well worth it for the views and variety of terrain. Definitely needs a decent suspension and MTB experience.  Great exercise and the coffee afterwards at the coffee “container” at The Springs was awesome.Afterwards we took the car to the top of Mt Wellington for outstanding views. Can highly recommend."
Magnificent Sky over Mt Wellington,Never sick looking at the different views of Mt Wellington - whether looking up at it or looking down from the top.We were lucky to catch these photos from South Hobart the past two days.
Magnificent views of Hobart and beyond,"This is a must-see!  Yes, it will be windy, most likely, so hang onto your hat! Stunning views of the city below.  Next trip I will do it at night."
Spectacular views and blowing a gale ,It was blowing a gale yesterday when we went up the mountain. A great view and the temperature was about 7 degrees lower than Hobart. Well worth our time for the beautiful views. We also did the Lenah trail walk halfway up the hill which also had great views.
What a mountain!,"We visited Mount Wellington in the evening, views were so beautiful from there. The biggest wow was the mountain it self. The drive up there was amazing and the vegetation was very special! I think this is a must when visiting Hobart!"
"I mean, it's a mountain..",Ended up cycling up this mountain. Took around 50mins. Fairly challenging. View from the top is well worth the effort! Then a beer after hehe
Magical Mount Wellington,"Most people will rush to the top of the mountain for the spectacular views of Hobart. It's a great lookout and photo op - be ready for cold winds as the temp is at least 10 degrees lower than Hobart. However don't miss out on some beautiful easy hikes before the pinnacle. We took the Sphinx Rock Circuit from The Springs>Sphinx Rock>Octopus Tree>The Springs. This was a beautiful walk, relatively easy except for one small part of walking down some rocks. Breathtaking views, stunning nature and a run in with a wallaby made this one of our favourite parts of our stay in Hobart."
Quick trip to lookout,"Wind chill was -3 C in January. Don’t think it won’t be cold.  An amazing view, roads are a bit scary. Well worth the drive"
Its big,It's a great drive winding up to the top with great views over the surrounding countryside. Make sure it's a clear day just toilets on the top with some vantage points points to take photos
A must in Hobart,"Wonderful views from so high, and interesting change in vegetation as you get higher. Be prepared for at least 10’ drop in temperature and very windy."
Go at sunset its worth the effort,We loved Mt Wellington and the views of Hobart from an altitude. It was my first time to Mt Wellington even though I have been to Hobart before.
Worth the drive,The journey took about 45 mins by car from Hobart. Plenty of parking on site. Come in a clear day and the view is amazing!
Stunning Views,The views from the top of Mount Wellington are a must see. The wind is intense at the top though and the weather is cool so a jacket is a must in all season. The roads to the top are also very windy and narrow so make sure you are confident to make the drive as once you get started it there are very few places to turn around.
New Year,"Great place to visit and see in the New Year, check the weather first, you want a cloud free night so you can see the fireworks"
That view,"Wow, last minute decision to swing past... Was not disappointed, definetly rug up the wind from the top was freezing but the view did not disappoint! You can see everything it is amazing, lots of little trails all around too walk a bit and take some great photos."
A must do thing at Hobart,At only 30 min of Hobart this site offer a spectacular view of Hobart. You can park a car in a lower parking and walk one hour to arrive to the site or you can directly park at the top. It is all free.
Great view from a soaring height,"Probably easier to do it in a car but we did see buses doing the road as well.  Remember to take a jumper no matter what the weather in Hobart, it gets cold and windy up there.Great boardwalk that takes you to different spots to see the view below.  Haze at times does spoil the view but if you wait 10 minutes it is bound to clear up again."
spectacular,"Great views, good boardwalks to vantage points and modern and clean toilets. The view is panoramic and you can see all of Hobart"
Tourist,"This is amazing  it was great to see the whole of Tasmania from up here, it was freezing up here but well worth it."
Surprisingly worthwhile: a must-see in Hobart,"I've climbed lots of mountains, and taken the occasional tram up to a high place above a touristy town - I was expecting more of the same - boy was I wrong.Mt Wellington rises about 4,000 feet above Hobart, and that's enough elevation change in this climate to go from high-latitude temperate climate to a fairly extreme alpine climate. All I can say is WOW!.  The temperature change was from roughly 60°F in Hobart to near freezing on the summit of Mt Wellington. The vegetation varied from no trees (above tree-line) to alpine scrub - and it was windy, oh so windy (25 mph gusts, steady 15 mph).  That might not sound appealing, but it is a way to get into the back-country of Tasmania, right in Hobart. And then there's the drive up the mountain - a winding narrow mountain road, that starts out in a neighborhoods, but rapidly becomes a set of alpine switchbacks.I was expecting a high viewpoint above the city - I was not prepared for the climate change, the beautiful rocks and vegetation, the winding challenge of an amazing mountain road.Don't miss it. We drove our car up there -- but you can take a tour, or even take a city bus. Lots of options. Make it happen."
Fantastic - don't forget a jacket!,"Depending on what kind of day you go, it's hard to have a bad day here.We did a sunset tour and the clouds were just creeping in, making for a very dramatic photo.You must come up here to see the beautiful views!"
wow,"we had a beautiful Coach ride from the information centre at Hobart up to the top of  Mt Wellington the coach driver very knowledgeable and funny, no snow that day and is the only coach that will go though the gates if they are closed during snow.as they have the exclusive requirements to be able to drive in up to 1 meter of snow. be prepared is an excellent look over the town the only walking you need to do is from bus to lookout."
Amazing Views,"Outstanding views of Hobart, and very easy to access as a short day trip.  Wish we had booked a bike tour - gradient is hectic but not cruel and lots of companies offering downhill trips.  If driving - go early as the bike groups (especially when cruise ships are in harbor) gobble up the narrow road & really slow the drive down.  If you have time - the. You can grab some great photos from the car window."
"Great 360 degrees view from the top, especially during sunrise/sunset!","There are lots of open air lookouts that offer 360 degrees stunning view of the surrounding area, including Hobart.  There is ample parking at the top for visitors.  Pinnacle observation shelter is open to the public during the in the period 1 September to 30 April from 8 am – 10pm, and from 1 May to 31 August from 8am – 4:30pm.Before driving up Mount Wellington, do check the City of Hobart website as Pinnacle Road may be closed at any time of the year due to snow and ice or other severe weather conditions.  It's closed right now due to severe fire danger while I was typing this review."
Spectacular View,Well worth the drive. We took our binoculars so we’re able to pick out our accommodation which was good to see and pick out many other land marks. Toilets at the top as well as a sheltered observation lookout for windy days. Walkways to the other three lookouts are an easy walk for any fitness level.
What Views!!,We had a beautifully clear day on our visit so the views were spectacular!  I am so glad I saw Hobart from up top!
360,"Must visit first, before you try any other tours. Gives you an idea of Hobart landscape - helicopter view."
"Great view from, not so good to.....","It's worth the trip up; so unique to have a city under a mountain of this size.  Views are wonderful!  Can even park at the Springs and walk up - strenuous, but you've then earnt the view even more.  The drive is easy but just watch the halfwit cyclists who seem to think the speed limits don't apply on their downhill slalom taking up both sides of the road.  The one amusement I find with the locals is they're against a cableway to the pinnacle, yet they have these towers on top which are an absolute eye-sore and detract from what is an iconic attraction."
Fantastic look out,You have a Great lookout by sunny and clear Weather. You can go round and have a great overview. The way up and down by car is spectacular and nothing for scary driver.
Well worth doing ,"A must see in Tassie! It really puts the great city of Hobart into perspective. The views are breathtaking and it’s an incredible 360 degree view - great for families, kids and couples."
"Dress warm, with hats, layers and windproof jacket","Even if you were just staying 15 minutes hour for photos, dress warm. It was icy windy and hailed/snowed when we were up there in mid summer day.  Most people knew to put on a warm hat and had wind breakers on.  The view was nice but that was all you go there for.There was also a nice washroom facility. It looked almost like a nice outlook rest area with all-glass exterior wall where you can enjoy the view while you wash your hands."
Fabulous view,"Ok the drive can be tricky, but so worth the view when you get there. Make sure you take a coat no matter what the weather. Will be at least 10 degrees colder up the top. There are a couple of great viewpoints on the way up. Road can be closed in extreme weather."
Fantastic view and amazing experience,"Loved Mt Wellington...  it was pretty cold and windy, but still worth the trip up there.  A great place to go on our 20th Wedding Anniversary...  will be very memorable."
Superb views,"The main reason to go up the mountain is for the views over Hobart and beyond. We drove up the mountain to the top and initially we were greeted with no views and snow, temperature of -1c and strong winds giving a chill factor of a good few degrees lower than this.....in December. However we waited as it was only a shower until it passed and were rewarded with fine views making the trip worthwhile."
Well worth the winding ascent.,"Te winding road led to the Pinnacle of the Mountain. Very well set out to accommodate tourist viewing of Hobart almost 800 metres below. The car parks, the enclosed fully glazed viewing area, the paths and boardwalks all geared to enable visitors to take full advantage of the excellent vantage point.Well worth the drive. We travelled with a 6 year old boy who enjoyed looking through the telescope and his 14 month  old very energetic, independent little sister. We were grateful for the closed viewing area."
Tourism,"Went to tour Mt. Wellington, with a tour company, Hobart Tours, the driver cum guide was knowledgeable and cheerful, he had lots of jokes, made the tour interesting, good tour company to recommend, Mt. Wellington was nice and cool in summer,good views and facilities. Good experience."
"Fabulous location, views are stunning","Have been lots of places seen lots of scenic views and I don’t thinks we have seen anything as majestic as this. Even on a slightly cloudy, hazy day it took the breath away."
Visit to Summit of Mount Wellington ,"I took a mainland friend to the summit of Mount Wellington/kunanyi to see the amazing vistas of southern Tasmania and Hobart. Being Summer, there are crowds of people, so take the first available car park if driving. Take a jacket and other warm clothing also as it’s much cooler than Hobart city and can be very windy. The drive to the summit requires care as roads are narrow, winding, and busy. The views are breathtaking and superb. Well worth the time and effort. Great photo opportunities!"
Best view in Tasmania ,I love this place I could sit here all day and stare at its surroundings. After a careful drive up the mountain the 30 mins from Hobart is well worth it. Pack your beanie though it’s not what o would call warm!
Must see attraction,"This was the second time here. If you want to remember that summer is not everywhere in Australia this is a a must. If your lucky the clouds willl part as you reach the summit, if not, you have to dream about what the view would be. I’ve always been lucky, the views are stunning and the weather is always cold. Going to port Arthur you can look back and say...I’ve been there. Such a dominating feature to the landscape. A must see attraction"
Interesting,We got a cruise tour to the top and the guide said it was a white nuckle trip and he was correct.It takes a while to get to the top and if the weather is good the sights are wonderful.On the day we visited the Temp at the top was 3.5c and boy was it cold and windy.I think i actually got face cramp it was so cold
10°C drop from coast to summit,"I took a 40 minute drive from MONA (sea level) to the summit of Mt Wellington (1270m above sea level), and the first thing I noticed was the drop of temperature. It was a warm 20-21°C at MONA but it was only 11°C at the summit. (There is a thermometer at the entrance of the observation shelter.) Thanks to the constant howling wind, it felt like below 10°C. I was amazed to see some people dressed in shorts and flip-flops. (They were either brave, or ignorant...) There are only 2 shelters at the summit: an observation shelter with nice views and some educational info panels, and the nice and modern toilet. From the shelter/toilet, there's a 200m path to the south west viewing platform, with nice view of the mountain-top plateau and the radio tower. (The platform is facing west so you can get a nice view of the sunset too.)"
Experience true climate change,"Never had a hot day up the top. Can be windy, wet, snow ridden, unpleasant, but still worth a drive to the top."
Take your winter woollies!,"Even though we went here in summer, it can still snow and the road is closed, but we were lucky and had a clear day and could go to the top. It is very cold and windy, so make sure you take something warm - we had jeans, jumpers, beanies, scarves and gloves! Amazing views from the top looking over Hobart"
Fantastic views and interesting history,"Charles Darwin climbed Mount Wellington, although it took him 2 attempts. It was much easier in a car and when you reach the summit the views are panoramic. We were lucky to clear skies and dry ground to explore the area. I would like to go back and hike up the mountain."
View from the sky!,The clouds lifted after 2 rainy days giving us the opportunity to drive up the mountain and enjoy spectacular views.
Spectacular views of Hobart and and surrounding area,"After about a 30-40 minute drive to the top from the centre of Hobart you are afforded great views of Hobart and the surrounding area (assuming that there is no fog or cloud to obscure your view - its best to check the weather forecast before you go!). Also be on the lookout for groups of cyclists descending the mountain at speed as the road is particularly windy in places.There are some walks to be had from the car park, although these are probably best undertaken by people with experience of walking over rough terrain. Probably not suitable for those with young children, due to the nature of the rocks / cliff edges.There are no shops, restaurants or cafes at the top, unlike some other European mountains so be warned (there are toilets and a viewing area though)."
Great views,"There are wonderful views from the top but sadly no ‘panorama boards’ to show what you are looking at. Why have boards at the top of a mountain asking kids to count the arches on the Hobart Bridge (that is not why you go to the top of a mountain!) but not have a board that shows all the mountain tops, islands and towns etc, that can be seen."
Impressive Views,"Mount Wellington allows for either a hike or, as in our case, a drive at just the right time as the sun was going down. Experience a unique view of Hobart, the harbour, suburbia, an impressive horizon line and great photo opportunity.Be prepared for a sudden change of temperature as you experience the cold winds on the other side of the mountain, understanding how this beautiful landmark protects Hobart from the worse winds."
Best view ever,Great views and lots and lots of photo opportunities that will blow you away. With the harsh rocks and shrubs and the wonderful water views you will click to your hearts content
Spectacular,"Spectacular scenery from the Pinnacle. Despite the strong winds and weather, we enjoyed the cold and snow from the night before."
Freezing but fun ,"A must visit when in Hobart. Stunning views!! But make sure you rug up, and I mean beanie, gloves and layers — so cold. We absolutely loved it though. Such a blast (literally 😂 and as an experience)."
Beautiful view of Hobart,"It's a short drive from Hobart, and the view up there is definitely worth the relatively short drive. Road was also comfortably wide, but gets slightly narrower at certain sections as you go higher. It's still enough for 2 full sized SUV to pass each other though. Just need to slow down as you pass.If you are heading up, do prepare a jacket or wrap as it's colder than in the city with strong wind. This will make you enjoy the view even more."
Amazing ,"What a view only 20 minutes out of Hobart CBD totally worth the drive and  to top it off the best coffee we had in Tasmania was half way up at Lost Freight Cafe, great service as well a must!!"
Great view ,"Only a short drive from the city centre up a steep, winding and narrow road (if you’re not confident driving on this sort of road it might be worth getting one of the buses) but the view over the city is amazing. There’s an enclosed viewing area which is handy if the weather turns in addition to several large viewing platforms. Worth a visit."
Outstanding Panoramic Views,It would be the best views over an Australian city with your feet still on the ground. The drive is not too far but make sure you give yourself plenty of time as the road is windy and slow.Prepare yourself for some wind chill and enjoy the fantastic views.
Amazing Height above the City of Hobart,"See everything below! Bring a very warm jacket and hat! Its much cooler up the top! Many walks off the top and stop your car along the hairpin bends to walk the forest trails within. They are very easy walks for children too. Find the Elephant Tree??? Stop at 'The Springs' car park half way up, for good easy walks or climb to the top from there? A cup of coffee is available and toilets too in this spot. You need a car or a bus tour to access but you can walk up from Cascade Brewery, great tracks from just behind there. Take a map! The Fern  Tree Tavern has them plus Tourism Tas office."
Snowing in December,We just arrived pick up hire car and drove to the top to be greeted with snow in December it was great. Worth the drive for the amazing views of Hobart.
Winds That Will Blow You Over,"30 minute Switch Back Road to top for magnificent views of Hobart and environs.  But the winds on the day I was there practically knocked me off my feet, despite that fact that I still maintain my NFL Linebacker Physique.  Ordinary people had to hang on to whatever they could grab.  Thank god they've built a glass observation building, because it was impossible to stand outside.  A downhill mountain bike tour was set to launch, but there was no way they could ride till they descended to the tree line."
Excellent views of Hobart!,"Make sure you rug up for this! Exceptional views of Hobart and if you are lucky, it may even snow in December."
Good view,"Scenery is soooo good than Bruny island i think. But very cold, recommended to prepare the jacket !!"
Must see,My Wellington is a must see.  Good drive up and fantastic views.If you’re  fit there are walking trails. Even saw some snow
Blooody cold all year round,"Bring all your clothes when you get up here! Note that this road can be closed due to weather conditions, so plan accordingly"
The best thing to do in hobart,After a 30 min drive from Hobart the view you get at the top is stunning. remember to take a coat it is mighty cold on top.
Still freezing in November,Still had snow on the ground and chill factor of minus9 in November. But great views etc. Make sure you wear VERY warm clothing.
Beautiful drive,The best part of Mt Wellington is actually the drive to the mountains. You feel like you are driving in the clouds. The views are stunning from the top point. Always carry a thick jacket as the temperature can drop from 15degrees to 4degrees in just few minutes
Beautiful Spot,The summit is absolutely beautiful and it's a must to drive up to the summit. The view is breath-taking.
Fantastic ,"A must do activity visiting Hobart, check the weather though. Very cold on the mountain but there is an enclosed viewing building.We went there when the weather was variable, was the best time, sprinkle of rain, clouds drifting by, then sunshine and expansive views, just incredible.Drive carefully if self driving, can be dangerous, also some parts of the road can be closed with icy weather."
Nice challenging walk,"We parked at the Chapel and took the Organ Pipes then Zig Zag tracks to reach the summit. Back down the road cutting across via the Panorama track made for a nice round trip taking just over 2 hours. Nice views from the top, a cafe or something up there would have been nice but there was nothing like that unfortunately. Definitely worth the trip, freezing cold in the wind up the top though. And watch out for snakes, we saw one - tiger snake possibly - crossing the path just in front of us around the organ pipes."
Changing weather,Well even in summer you may need your woolies. Changing weather is the go but what a view.  Great rock formation and walks. Really a time to remember. Make it a day stop pack a lunch and enjoy Australia really down under
AWESOME!!,This is a must see! Incredible views and amazing experience! Very fun outing for the whole family! It was very windy and cold but definitely worth the trip!
Not to be missed! Fantastic 360 degree views. Wow!,"It is definitely worth a drive, regardless of how much time you have. The views are amazing and there are many hikes to make this a day trip."
Blistering cold wind but magnificent views from the summit,The title says it all. Definitely worth the effort to drive to the top. Halfway down there is a cabin serving hot drinks and light  snacks situated in a well kept sunny picnic area from which there are numerous woodland trails to explore. The trails are graded from ‘easy’ to ‘challenging’ to suit your ability.
Chilly and windy,Enjoyed the view from Mount Wellington but didn't stay long as it was cold and very windy. Was recommended to go out onto the boardwalk and wasn't  disappointed. Spectacular view. Even in November you need to rug up.
Mt Wellington summit,"Drove to the wind and cold too for awesome views, then walked down for 2 hrs in the shelter. Took the shuttle bus back to the top to get the car. Well sign posted and great tracks"
"scary, cold, wonderful","the trip up and down the mountain is challenging if, like me, you get vertigo, but it was well worth it, the temperate at the top was minus 2 and there were little patches of snow; the driver of the tour bus was fantastic with his commentary"
"Good hiking, bring rain gear","The 1 hour Sphinx Circuit hike from The Springs was pleasant and not too taxing. The Pinnacle lookout at the top had great views but bring a wind breaker and rain gear, as even on a hot spring day there were showers of rain and hail at the freezing summit!"
A must do,"Highly recommend taking the time to get to the top of this mountain, make though you don't drive up as the road is VERY winding and VERY narrow.  It is cold and windy at the top but the view is totally worth it."
My Wellington,"Wow what a great view from up here, very windy the day we went, but that didn’t bother us. Was ok inside the viewing facility.  Highly recommend this short drive while in Hobart!"
Surprising beautiful so close to Hobart,The original tourist searches were uninspiring but the short trip to the summit was well time spent. The views at the well appointed lookout points were fantastic. Breathtaking.Our trip was especially surprising as it started with bright sunshine in Hobart CBD and ended at the peak with a snow fall. A wonderful addition to our day. Do not be put off by any bad weather alerts as there is a warm viewing station that can be used instead of the out-door viewing platforms.
Magnificent,It's high. Fantastic views over Hobart and the River Derwent. There is a shelter to get out of the wind and cold. Wind was 132 km/h.
Just amazing! ,"Boy was it cold up there, and windy! But the view was well worth braving the road and the wind. Spectacular views overlooking Hobart and surrounds, lots of parking, toilet amenities and a viewing platform inside for those who don’t like the wind and cold combo (like me) A must do!"
Spectacular views,"This is a must do if in Hobart.  If you can see the top of the Mountain from the city go even if cloudy, for you will be able to see the views.  If you can't see the top from the bottom, go another day.  There is a sheltered or enclosed glass observatory at the top so do not let wind deter you.  Grandeur and majestic  describes the views."
MOUNT WELLINGTON HOBART TASMANIA,"It was worth the drive, via bus, up to Mount Wellington as you could look over the town of Hobart and see out to sea. Very cold and windy so be prepared."
Fabulous Views,"Best to go when fine with a few clouds, also mornings probably best before cloud builds up. It can be quite warm and sunny down in Hobart, but once you have got to the top it can be pretty chilly and windy. The weather can change quite rapidly.  It takes about fifteen to twenty minutes to drive up the windy road to the top, or many people walk, run or cycle.  Appropriate clothing is a must. And of course a camera!"
Great views but oh so cold,"Great views to the city and beyond. When we visited it was so windy, 85 kmh. we did have a laugh when we tried to walk and didn't get anywhere."
An experience you'll never forget,"What an absolutely beautiful place to visit!! Even though when we got to the top (we drove), and the clouds stopped our view of the surrounding areas at first, the view of the top of yoke mountain was exquisite! I never would have imagined it looked so amazing. It even SNOWED while we were there! We had an amazing time.Just be mindful that the roads are narrow getting to the top... we encountered many drivers who didn't stick to the far side of the roads so be careful and drive slow going up and down (and obviously taking into account the hikers and bike riders)."
Very Windy & Cold But Awesome view!,"Please be prepared with winter coat or Good windbreaker as the wind + low temp will keep in the car! If you are prepared, you will enjoy the view and even catch wild wallaby!!"
Wow what a view,"We went up to the summit with Hobart Shuttle Bus, $30 tour the ultimate trip and it was fantastic. A must do on your visit to Hobart, worth every cent. Guide was fantastic, views were sensational, bus was comfortable. felt very safe at every point  throughout the tour. Highly recommend"
Amazing walk! ,We walked from our hotel in the Salamanca area to the summit of Mt Wellington and then back to the springs car park. 18km in total. We were a bit nervous about the walk but are fit and healthy 35 year Olds. We loved every step. From Hobart to the springs was a lot of road walking with a few paths through the mountain. From springs to the top was beautiful goat tracks up my Wellington. Some parts were quite steep and rocky but going slow and steady doable. Getting closer to the top we saw snow and the views were bloody outstanding. Make sure you have a wind proof jacket as it gets very cold at the top. This is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable walks in have done in some time. It took us around 3.5 hours to get to from Hobart to the top.
Amazing view of Hobart,"The drive was a bit challenging, the temperature at the summit was much colder than hobart, however the view was amazing, and it really shows off hobart and its surrounding suburbs. You could even see all the way out to Port Arthur. Well worth a drive."
Stunning views and a little bit of snow !,"We (5 ladies on a weekend away) drove up so one of our group could see snow - she has never seen snow before !  The road is very twisty and there are a couple of places where passing is narrow but drive slowly and carefully and it will be fine.  At the top it was 6 degrees (17 degrees in Richmond only an hour earlier) but we had coats, hats and scarves and wrapped up warmly.  It was very windy and a little bit drizzly but we were still lucky enough to have clear enough views.  The view is spectacular !  Also there are interesting facts and history in an enclosed area too.  We also saw wallabies hopping around the rocks. A word of warning - there are no toilets at the summit.  This is well signposted and the last stop for toilets is well identified."
Nice view ,Drive up is a bit frightening but the view is worth it! Very windy on top and busy with people. Best to go in the early morning or late afternoon and make sure you have a scarf..
Must do!!! ,I came here with some friends and it was breath taking. The views were epic. It was pretty windy at the top so definitely recommend bringing a jacket. We drove up the top and there was plenty of parking. It’s definitely worth the trip.
Beautiful views and snow! ,"We were rewarded with a lovely, clear view of Hobart atop Mount Wellington. It even snowed briefly while we were up there. This is a fantastic option for those with a car looking to spend a couple of hours."
Amazing views don’t forget your warm clothing,Very clear day from below so decided to head up to the mountain 19 degrees in Hobart but don’t be fooled Easy drive but weather dropped significantly as we made the climb On arrival it was cold and windy but worth the visit
Breathtaking,"A must do visit in Tasmania, the sites are breathtakingly unbelievable. Make sure you take a jacket as it is very windy and freezing there."
"""The long and winding road""...(but totally worth it!!)","Take your time..... and hope you haven't got impatient people behind you, as there are places on the way up to Mt Wellington, that are narrow, and cars coming the opposite way sometimes can be coming at speed around tight corners.  Once arriving, we had to wait 10 minutes for a park, as it was a very busy day, probably because the sky was clear and the view amazing.  I think everyone decided to go up to the top that day!   Having said that, it is worth doing, the glassed in lookout is new since we were up there in 1982!!, and the boardwalk also...Both are amazing, and they are well done.  As others have said, the temperature is cooler there than in Hobart, but one would expect that.  It was a beautiful clear day for photographs of the harbour and the city.  Definitely a must do if you haven't been up, but pick the weather and be patient on the drive up as well as down!"
stunning vistas,there are truly incredible views from the viewing areas atop of Mount Wellington. The drive up the mountain is not for the faint hearted though
Freaky Weather One Minute & Sunny the next,The drive up to Mount Wellington is pretty steep and windy. During our drive it was raining and by the time we reach the top it was frosting. But 15 minutes later the weather clear up and the sun was shinning to reveal stunning views
Never see a sunrise like it anywhere.,"In the gloomy early morning darkness allow about forty minutes to drive up from the Hobart CBD. On the Pinnacle Road native wildlife abounds, wallabies, pademelons, wombats, native rats and there are also lots of rabbits. So take your time getting up there.But, if you want to see a sunrise with a panoramic view this would be one of the best places to do so in Tasmania. But get up there before the sunrises! I promise you that if you are up there on a good day you will not be disappointed.....cold, but not disappointed.Whatever the time of the year take warm clothes and be prepared for wind. For those not quite so intrepid there is the Observation Deck from which you can watch from a sheltered position.So whether a local, and I am a local who never tires of the mountain, or a visitor from mainland Australia or from overseas get yourself up there and don't forget your camera and tripod!"
Wonderful,"Allow plenty of time. Don’t go on a cloudy day. Spectacular!Very windy and narrow drive up, watch out for push bikes"
Coooold at the summit!,"Awesome drive up to the summit.(Luckily before the sky opened up)Defo RUG UP.. as it was 10C colder up there PLUS wind chill! It was a mild 23C in Hobart, 12C at the summit, but felt like 2C.... brrrr...Great vista."
"Great views, take the explorer bus","Mt. Wellington was one of my favorite things I did in Hobart. I was fortunate enough to go on a sunny, non-cloudy day, so I was able to see everything perfectly. I highly recommend taking the explorer bus up to the summit. I had Tony as a bus driver, and he talked not only about Mt. Wellington but the history behind Hobart as well. He stopped at a few spots on the actual mountain so we could get out and see different views. He was really informative. We had 30 minutes at the summit to explore (you could stay for longer if you wanted, the explorer bus was an all-day hop-on-hop-off pass). I only stayed for the 30 minutes because it was quite cold (and I had a flight to catch). Tony recommended to stay and do some of the hiking trails if you had the time. The only recommendation I have is to check the weather before you book anything and make sure you get a clear day. It will always be chilly up on the summit, but it was worth it."
"Beautiful Views, great walk down","We hired a car to take us to the top of Mt Wellington.  The views of Hobart and the surrounding area are spectacular!  Then we walked down the trail, which was beautiful.  The first part is a little steep, and has a lot of steps.  It took about 2 hours.  We were looking forward to a beer at the restaurant at the bottom, but it's closed on Mondays!"
Enjoy the view but take a stroll,"Great 360 degree views of Hobart and its’ surrounds. Once you’ve soaked in your fill of the sights and scenery below, hit one of the many trails for a walk"
Amazing views,"The 30 minute trip up a winding, thin road is worth it. Although the road can cause issues with 2 big cars passing its done by thousands every day. There is sufficient parking for small and large vehicles and public toilets (currently under renovation) There is a viewing deck, walking paths and tracks and the view is amazing!!"
Anniversary ,Flew in at lunch and grabbed a car and headed up the mountain. What a wonderful surprise divine views and a stubby breeze that took the heat from the day. Meditated on some rocks facing north with the winds washing away the days flights .
A mountain climb,Take a trip up to the top travelling on safe but heart stopping roads and be rewarded with the most amazing viewsof hobart and surrounding areas right down to huonville. Expect freezing winds that are strong enough to makejust walking seem impossible and feel like you will be blown off the mountain. If byou are lucky there may even be snow. All worth it to see the most wonderful views in australia
A place with a View.,Driving to the top of Mt Wellington is a long and winding road at very slow speeds you will encounter other traffic either on the way up or down. The road is narrow so take most care when the car in the other direction approaches. Once at the top there is a lot of parking and it’s Free. The views if weather permitting are spectacular but as I mentioned be aware of the weather as it changes quickly. I saw they have local busses running to the top I don’t know the times or places they leave from. For the photographer in you you’ll have a great time getting that great shot. If in Hobart it’s a must do. Just make sure you have the appropriate clothes for the day. If you have walking disability you may find this a bit to hard to get around. The place has boardwalk and steps and sealed surfaces but it’s still a challenge for people with walking disabilities.
Great views of Hobart and surrounding area,Best place to see Hobart and the area around Hobart.Definitely cooler up there than in Hobart. Needed to wear warm clothes to go up there that day. Enjoyed the board walk around the lookout. Toilets were available too.
A must do when visiting Hobart,"We picked a clear day to go up to the summit. It is not well sign posted so a map is essential. Easy drive to the summit and as advised, the weather can be very cold and windy up there, even on a good day. The views are fantastic, and you can see a quarter of the island from this view point. Well worth the drive, and also there are buses that travel up here regularly."
The walking trails are a must if you enjoy nature walks!,"Very cold, but great view at the top and beautiful walking trails at around half way. Your surroundings are like something out of a fairy tale. Just gorgeous."
A must see,"So glad we went after friends said to go, spectacular views. It's a very winding road so if your not a confident driver there is the red bus service."
It’s worth it ,"The long windy road incorporates some beautiful scenery, native Australian bush and incredible views. It then gives way to the brutally beautiful peak. Pack clothes and gear for all weather - this isn’t a place you want to get caught out."
Those views...wow!,"Made the drive up to the Mt Wellington lookout. The views are amazing from the top. Be warned that its cold and windy at the top, but totally worth it."
freezing but worth it,"Went up there for the view, instead we were in the clouds and could see very little. It was cold and wet, but the place still had a really pretty and cool look about it. We even got to see some wallabies roaming around. Worth the visit."
Lovely drive on a crisp clear day,"If you want to see all of Hobart in one hit, this is it. Such an incredible view and anyone can go there for free."
must see,"If you're in Hobart, you must make the time to visit the Wellington summit.  The view is awe-inspiring, and my group even enjoyed a little snowball fight in the parking area.  One can only imagine how difficult it must have been to build that road during the Depression with the tools available then."
Good free trip,Really good views over Hobart. The parking area at the top is free. Good view points. Some interesting information. An indoor viewing area was good in the cold.
Cold but amazing view,"When we visited it was cold - but the view was amazing  - and the lookout had heated seating The cloud came over and we lost our view but we stopped on the way back down the mountain and under the cloud cover, we saw and took photos of the city lights"
"If you can't see the peak, don't bother driving up","Also, check the website for road closures. We learned the hard way when we made it to the top one day only to find white out conditions and there was nothing to see. On or second attempt the road was closed halfway up. Third time's a charm and it was a clear day, we were glad we kept trying. Mount Wellington is a must see when in Hobart. Simply breathtaking."
Breathtaking,Drove up for night view of Hobart. Even though cold and drizzling night still stunning. There is no night lighting so be aware very dark. Parking available
Mount Wellington,The view is tremendous- although can change quickly.  The mist began rolling in while we were there.  Lots of snow there the day before but only a little while we were there.  Beware of bike riders coming down
Fantastic views! ,Made the most of the fine weather and made the drive up today..it was totally worth the effort. Amazing views..the wind was bitter but worth it for that view! Some people really need to be considerate of others on the narrow steep drive up though..they think it’s a race track! Slow down and take your time!
Extremely high,"Personally ... hated it.  Did not make it to the top, as my vertigo set in and I was TERRIFIED...  the road is extremely narrow and extremely windy with hardly any side/guide rail. Scary..scary.. scary.Anyway, if you're ok with the above,  I'm sure the view is lovely   :)"
Amazing views!,"The easy drive up to the summit winds around the mountain, with glimpses of breathtaking views. Once up the top, a couple of viewing decks allow for picturesque photos with the whole of Hobart in the background. Still quite chilly up there in the warmer months, with snow over night. Rug up!"
The Views!!,"If you can see the top from the wharf, then make the effort to go up. Fantastic views and only a short drive (30 mins) from Hobart. It will be very cold so take extra cloths."
Bus up and cycyled down,Nice spin up on a tour bus.  Then a very fast trip back to Hobart. Nice views but a bit cold on top! Bus driver gave a good history lesson on the way up. Good value at 25 dollars
On top of Tasmania ,"We felt like we were on the top of the world on Mt Wellington The road was very good, ample parking, spotlessly clean facilities and a views to die for...."
Great view,Very cold so take lots of layers. Beautiful views from the top.Free to enter and a nice pLce to have something to eat
Be prepared for changing weather,Scenery changes as you climb up in elevation from Hobart. Take care on the roads.  And be prepared for weather changes up on top.
I'm reviewing a mountain,"The mountain is rad, ah nature etc. Nice and cold, so bring all the things. What I'm really reviewing is the long and incredibly shoddy/slim road, and that after this strenuous journey there are about 100 other cars up there all lined in a carpark. It's like rocking up at a sky supermarket, which was bizarre. Beautiful view etc, but crowded. Definitely good to do when the car isn't yours, and the driver is ballsy."
Breathtaking scenery Mt Wellington,Mt Wellington is a must visit place when you are in Hobart Tasmania. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking. There is 1 cafe at Spring area called Lost Freight cafe. It is a great place for coffee in cold weather.
Dress warm and lower expectations of seeing a view from the top.,"The entire time we were in Tassie, it was cloudy. We still decided to head up there on our last day, just to see what could be seen. As we drove up, we admired the view of the Hobart area. Such a pretty city! During our journey up the mountain, we saw glimpses of snow on the road (my first time seeing snow!), and as we got even higher, there was more of it. We arrived at the top and it was actually snowing and very cold. Luckily we had our luggage in the car and could layer more clothes on. So, make sure you are prepared and have warm clothes and proper footwear as it can be slippery.Unfortunately once we reached the top of the mountain, there was not much of a view due to the thick clouds. So, also lower any expectations unless you go on a very clear day.There are a few safe places on the way down to pull over and take some photos/admire the view of the city, so not a total waste of a trip up if it's too cloudy up top."
"Watch the weather, but definitely worth visiting","It is possible to drive right the way up, but the road is closed if the weather looks questionable, definitely worth visiting for views and seeing the local forest.  Various walks available, but be prepared for changes in the weather."
Best view in the world. Just like Google Earth! ,"I went on a very clear day (important disclaimer!). Don’t plan to go, wait for the sun and drive up. In the very cold the top section of roads may be closed though, so do check before setting off. The drive up is fun too! I’ve been up lots of mountains around the world, and many much higher, but the view here was stunning."
Holiday,Good place to visit with the family..Good views of the city..Good location..Good place to for a drive...
Totally amazing view,Oh my god awesome view however check temperatures before heading up. It was very cold. The viewing station is so warm and very informative. A compass station would have been helpful. Good drive up and very pretty views of the city.
Lovely day for a tour,"We booked a tour at the Information Centre to Mt Wellington. It was a lovely day... the sun is up. Our tour guide from Hobart Shuttle Bus Tour, Adrian, was so friendly & funny. This is the kind of tour we are expecting especially it's our first time to visit Hobart."
"Worth the drive up, don't forget your beanie and coat!","great way to see all of Hobart from a birds eye view, it's about 10 degrees colder and extremely windy up top so don't foget to take a warm coat and a beanie! There was a small coffee van at the start of the road, looked popular, and a nice place to stop. If you want to climb over the rocky top be sure to wear good shoes with grip. Definitely worth visiting!"
Mountain Trip,Love this place. Have been up in Summer and Winter. Amazing views over Hobart. Got to experience snow.
Great View,"A steep hike or run if you want to walk up the mountain. We decided to drive. View from the top is spectacular. Take a jacket because it is cold up there. Appreciate the labour that were used to build the road up the mountain, all done by hand. A must do when you visit Hobart."
Hire a car and drive to the top ,An incredible view of Hobart. Take a jacket it is freezing up there and make sure you go on a clear day as the view make be impacted otherwise.
worth going up for a look if its a nice day,very interesting tour and great views well worth doing if its a clear day as the views are amazing  should see it
Pack a jacket it’s cold up there,This place is so good. It’s so close to town so you don’t have to drive for ages to get there. The temp is 10 degrees cooler than Hobart so pack a jacket. Great view up the top but prob not worth going if you can see cloud on the top.
Awesome and breathtaking,We drove up after the Salamanca Markets.  Take your time as we had a clear sky day so it was quite busy by late morning.  The change in landscape on the way up the on top 360o views were awesome.  Take your time to absorb.
Trip to Top of Hobart,"Stunning vista. While the road trip up was a little scary when one gets to the top it is well worth it. Great photos taken, well worth the effort to traverse the winding road on the way up."
Stunning view,Mount Wellington summit had a stunning view and it was definitely worth the drive all the way up. It gets colder as you go higher and higher but the views are worth watching.A must see when you are in Hobart.
Mt Wellington,"The road up to the top can be hair raising but the views fantastic. We were there late September to early October 2019 and there was still patches of snow between the rocks. Wear warm clothing as the wind can be freezing cold, especially coming from a warmer state like WA."
Breathtaking,"It's a view. Theres not a whole lot you can say. But WHAT a view! Mt Wellington looms large over Hobart, always beckoning you to visit until you finally succumb. Locals plan their day by her moods. From the summit you can see, well, everything. The Derwent Valley way past Glenorchy in the North and past Bruny Island in the South. Absolutely breathtaking!"
What a View,"The trip up to Mount Wellington was an experience, firstly from the change in weather reasonable  to cold and then the view, amazing."
It was covered in snow.,"Well worth the drive up, the views of Hobart are spectacular but it was VERY cold... It's a good idea to stop at the container/cafe on the way up to buy something warm to drink."
Saw snow drifts!,Definitely worth the drive! Could see snow drifts....take warm clothes!! Check that the mountain is mainly clear at the summit (just cast your eyes and take a look from Hobart).
Must see in Hobart,Mt Wellington or Kunanyi is a must see in Hobart - beautiful view - be ready for 10 degrees colder that the city though - dress warm!
"Well worth a visit, close to Hobart",Magnificent views of the city. An easy drive. We played in the snow. And it’s free! Rug up as it’s 10 degrees colder than Hobart!
Well worth it,FREEZING! But amazing views and well worth the drive up.  We got a bit nervous because the road gets a bit narrow half way up but it is fine so long as you don't pass a bus!
Amazing Views,Prepare yourself for the cold. The difference between Hobart and Top of Mount Wellington is 1deg for every 100mts up and at 1200m it can be cold. The day we went up with wind chill factor was - 9 deg. It was snowing :)Coming from North Qld it was extreme for us but worth it. The weather comes in fast but clears fast also. The view from platform and also indoor viewing area are stunning. Well worth the drive up.
Worth the wait AMAZING sights,For 3 days the wouldn’t let us up due to ice. But on the morning we were leaving we were allowed to. And it was a beautiful drive to the top and was about 2 degrees. With snow at the top. We were lucky no clouds were around and the views were amazing it’s a must do while here
Must see,Self drive up was easy and the view.. wow. We even got to play in a little snow. Bring your extra jacket as it was so cold.
Stunning... must see!!,Amazing view of the city below and surrounds!!! We were lucky to play with some snow even!! Lovely little coffee shop (shipping container) on the way up near picnic/BBQ area.... must do!
Must drive up here,"Drove up here with my rented car from EasyRentCars.com and it was super worth it. There's lots of snow on the floor and super duper windy, so layer yourself properly. If you come around 4.30-5pm during winter period, stay for the sunset. That's what me and my partner did. We sat in the car and snack away while watching the sun set before our eyes. So beautiful."
It snowed!!,I had heard that it’s possible to see snow on Mt Wellington but I couldn’t believe it when it started to snow. I was so excited but so cold as I wasn’t exactly dressed for it. The view from here was impressive. As a bonus on the way down we saw a double rainbow.
