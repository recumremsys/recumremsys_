Popular sea front,So this is a popular sea front road that stretches for miles. The road can be very busy and there are always crowds of people on the promenade. You will see lots of couples pending quality time sitting facing the sea. Occasionally you see an entertainer or two.We were in Mumbai over new year and had the pleasure of being on Marine Drive on new years eve. It was absolute madness with so many people out celebrating. The road was closed for this.Early morning is the best time to walk down the promenade. You see many people out walking or for a jog. Nice cool breeze and before the sun comes out.
The Queens Necklace,Always enjoy to drive up here and view the sea. The heart and soul of Bombay with eateries dotted about. The evening draws many people and it’s a place for the locals and those eating to absorb the spirit of India. The Cricket Ground is near by as is the colonial landmark - Wilson College. For a better view of Marine Drive take the road to Malabar Hill and see it in all its splendour - very photogenic. Worth a walk or drive depending on your time. Careful of the street beggars!
Do not miss to see if you visit Mumbai,Martinez drive is a tourist attraction in Mumbai.  Every tourist came to Mumbai visit this place once.  Very beautiful scene along with the bridge.
Drive,"A great way to walk by the eve .. near the sea Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai, India.

Great to watch the sun set,This area is very popular with the locals to watch the sun go down. The best place to watch is by the cricket grounds and Marine Plaza Hotel area. If you go to the beach the sun goes down over the Hanging Gardens area and not the sea
good drive way near the coast,good driveway along the coastline. it has a nice walkway like all cornices. u will find many ppl are taking a walk or running along this way.
A place to go! It is called Queen's Necklace!,Marine Drive is a place to cool down in the evening. Lots of people gather to see the sunset. Also good to take a long leisurely walk.

A pleasant respite,We found a drive along Marine Drive to be a pleasant respite from the manic yet fascinating streets of Mumbai.  It is very pleasant to watch the locals stroll along the walk way or sharing a picnic.

The quintessential landmark of Mumbai,"Marine drive, also known as the Queen's necklace, is the quintessential landmark of Mumbai. It attracts one an all and come rain or shine, it never disappoints."
A Lovely  walk along the promenade with partner licking a BaskinsRobbins  ice cream,What  a vibrant city mumbai  is . We stayed at the ambassador just around the corner from Marine Drive. The first evening there we went out to explore the vibrant city and once we negotiated the hectic road we strolled along a Jewel of a promenade overlooking the Arabian Sea. The night lights of the high rise cityscape were on the promenade busy with runners walkers young and old what a delight . Best time is at night to walk or early morning to run
A bit smelly and smoggy,Another of those must do activities. (?) It was very busy (late Sunday afternoon as sunset approached)Unfortunately the views across the water were interrupted by smog. The stench from the water as the tide was going out was a bit much.. hidden only by the traffic pollution.It would be a really nice walk if it wasn't for the above. There are people everywhere and the atmosphere is good. I'm sure on a clearer day the view would be worth it.We took a stroll.. people will approach you to take your photo as you walk along..we just politely said no.. but some people still tried and secretly tried to take our photo. In the end we just ignored it and went with it.
Beautiful drive,"Marine Drive is beautiful and also called “The Queen’s Necklace” because of all of the lights on it at night making it sparkle like jewelry. The Drive is a horseshoe shape and encircles a large expanse of sand and the Arabian Sea. Very nice in the day and even prettier at night. A slight warning here... even though the setting is lovely, the water is highly polluted. I certainly wouldn’t swim in it."
Great position to stay in Mumbai,"I stayed in a small hotel on Marine Drive and absolutely loved the area. It looks right out over the Arabian sea across to the Gulf of Aden. It's a great walk down the Drive to the Gatteway of India. at night you can go up to the lovely Hanging Gardens, from where one can view ‘The Queen’s Necklace’, which is essentially the whole of Marine Drive magnificently lit up by its streetlights, so that it does indeed look just like a necklace."
Scenic view and relaxing sound of waves,One of the best things to do in the city if you just wanna chill and relax. I love going here as it gives me a chance to clear my head and just get lost in the sound of the waves. Also a budget friendly option.
Dazzling,"The Marine Drive is dazzling to view in the night time. The horseshoe shaped Drive is littered with bright lights (from the buildings) that slowly fade into the water. You can also get a carriage ride there. If you walk for some time along the Drive, you can also see  the Hotel Trident."
Popular spot throughout the day,"Went here during my short trip to Mumbai. I was told that this is one of the most popular spot in the city. Indeed, even in the afternoon, there were people sitting around & taking pictures. The view from here is very nice. One can see the expanse  towards the Arabian Sea & feel the sea breeze."
Leisure,"Walk the promenade at sunset .. fabulous views of bay,  filled with warmth and people out enjoying ... couples’ romantic paradise and tourists’ dream stop off ..."
Stunning ,Great place to just chill and walk along the Drive. Stunning view. Traffic  a bit crowded but seeing all the people enjoying themselves.
A definite stop when touring Mumbai ,The Queens necklace is a lovely place to go for a stroll and enjoy the fresh sea breeze. It’s set adjacent to the Arabian Sea that uplifts your soul and spirit. A must do stop when touring Mumbai
A great place to watch the world go by!,"Marine Drive is basically a seafront promenade along the Arabian Sea. It's a great place to watch Mumbai's  life go by.... at different times of the day you can see runners, joggers walkers, newly- weds taking photos, locals watching the sunset etc etc."
Motorway Stroll,"Way overrated, if you like to walk along a seaside path with a motorway on one side and a polluted sea on the other, accompanied with dubious air quality, then go for it.I read somewhere that this was a romantic walk however, my wife nearly divorced me after taking her there!"
Beautiful drive ,We hired a car to take us around to see the sights. What lovely places you’ll see. Some areas are cleaner than others. Amazing homes.
Daily excercise,"Glorious daily walks up and down the Marine Drivr to stay fit after several dinners in South Mumbai. In the same time you join the Mumbai people relaxing, doing fitness, eating, drinking etc. A vivid experience"
Marine Drive in Mumbai...serene,It’s always a pleasure to walk along Marine Drive in Mumbai.  The Locals and Tourist are found walking and jogging along Marine Drive.The Queens Necklace is a great view but with the pollution can be bothersome at times.It’s advisable to stroll along Marine Drive when one visits Mumbai.
Beautiful and safe,"I was there during the day, and was not too crowed. Clean place. Relaxing. I didn’t see the lights at night but I bet it’s beautiful"
Nice place to roam around,The Marine Drive is a fantastic place to roam around with fresh atmosphere and a beautiful environment.
A nice walk,This is a lovely walk along the coastline so many locals or Indian tourists promenade along here. Very friendly area and as English tourists we were asked by Indian families if we would pose for photos with them. A lovely area.
good place to enjoy sea breeze,it is a long sea side walk area. people come here to pass leisure time and for physical exercise like walking or jogging. In the morning and evening it becomes crowdy but still remains a good place to pass time.
DIAMOND NECKLACE !,"This is the most beautiful place in Mumbai. It is crowded every day of the week. It is visited by almost all the visitors to Mumbai. There won't be a person who did not visit Marine Drive who has come to Mumbai for any work. This place appears to be like Diamond Necklace at night. You experience the vagaries of nature in Monsoon here. In monsoon, we get a spectacular view of Ganapati Visarjan throughout the day and night on Ananat Chaturdashi day. Married as well as new unmarried couples visit this place and enjoy the beautiful sea here. Friends and groups of people flock to this place every day as well as night."
Nice evening ocean walk in big city,A very long curving promenade adjacent to the Arabian Sea that is a very popular evening stroll for thousands of locals and tourists. Many locals sit on the wall to watch the sunset. There are very few commercial enterprises to spoil the view.
Excelent and amazing place to sit and relax!,"I absolutely loved this place! I love to have a glimpse of water! Just went by here and manage to experience it for a few minutes! But I´m definitely coming back here with my spouse to spend time here! Got to see many young couples here, catching a breeze... Really place place!"
Nature Lover!!,"Such a beautiful place it is! You will surely have a great time here with your loved ones , not only loved ones but also alone , its so beautifully structured!! its our fav place to spend the evenings!!"
We should priortaise environment conservation first .,"Visited on 06 February 2020 with my friends the marine drive area is neat and clean but seems sea area with heaps ,litter and fastfood garbage even sometimes you feel there bad smell too , hygiene is poor municipality or other concerned authorities shold improve there sanitation and hygiene which is need of the hour ,place is really beautiful and attractive I recommend everyone should reach once here when you visit mumbai and I suggest and appeal all we should think about our environment and future generations so don't pollute and save environment and ecology in any cast on priority.thanks Best RegardsMushtaq Pahalgami,Environmental Activist from Jammu and Kashmir(India)."
Calm place with a good view but..,"Marine drive possesses a nice view of the city's bay area and sunsets over the sea. It's normally, pleasantly windy in the evenings although crowded and if you can find a nice spot, a good place to read a book. Great place to watch the full moon and its effect on the waves. What's changed over the years is the kind of crowd which comes here, some of whom are loud or lacking basic public decency/ civility. Tobacco spit inscriptions can be found in many places meant for sitting. This is the biggest con. Other than that, a part of marine drive has a foul smell to it and pollution makes it an unlikely spot to frequent. I normally get here to escape construction noise elsewhere in the city. Cops can be seen patrolling. Garbage bins around."
Paranomic view,It is situation in sounth Mumbai and had paranomic view .it is also called as queen necklace . Very calm and serenity to can observe.
Beautiful place to walk,The Marine drive offers a beautiful scenery and is really a bliss in enjoying and walking together to the other side.
Nice Evening ,We went around by 8:00pm after dinner. Walking by seaside feeling the sea breeze. Clean O2 air. Hundreds walking by.
The necklace of mumbai,"If u r in mumbai and if u miss this beauty then you haven’t seen mumbai . A must spend time with gushing water around , the view of the hotels on the other side and the place is alive at even 12 pm .."
Marine drive,Not as much good as expected.. I will neglect if someone approach me to visit marine drive again....
A great tourist experience,"This is a long, beautiful walk along the ocean. It's a great way to spend time walking with friends and family. A great picture spot."
Great seafront drive ,Just make sure you leave the driving on this corniche to early morning and a weekend when you will get to see the road without traffic. We even saw a Bollywood movie shooting at the famous Cricket academy that is located along the drive.
Evening Spot for relaxation,Nice place to spend your evening with your close ones. Been here couple of time during my stay in Mumbai. One side you see the Seaside and busy traffic on the other
Beauty of queens necklace,A gorgeous promenade very regal royal befittingky called the Queens necklace and still a 99 percent residential area only in the wilderness of concrete jungle of mumbai calms your soul and nature at its best in the mudst of the cityIts the golden mile of Mumbai and hopefully will be cared for and maintained by the younger generation R
Marine Drive,Visited in the evening when the place was all lit up and the lights on the sides of the long smooth road looked like golden beads of a necklace. The sea is very calm and the steamers which were lighted up for Naval day celebrations looked beautiful. It is a nice place to have a long romantic walk or just sit and enjoy the view.The tall swanky buildings add to the grandeur.
Peace amidst mad rush,"My friend and I visited marine drive around midnight. The change in view from Andheri to South Mumbai is striking. So take a cab all the way. Marine Drive with the vast sea ending into nothingness is an unforgettable sight. The beautifully lit ""Queens Necklace"" The lights at the sea link, the tall buildings around, all make the view breathtaking. January is pretty cool so we had to wear jackets. Also the cab ride costed us around 1000 rupees to and fro. The local train would have costed 20 rupees, but then we would have missed the beautiful transition from West to south. The cool breeze, the chai  and the massage waala dodging the cops is a routine and quite funny. There's always hustle and bustle here but in a good way though. A must visit place."
Great for a walk or bike ride,"Great for a long walk, romantic stroll or bike ride. Kids can run, skate and just enjoy geing outdoors! Few street vendors and view is remarkably peaceful."
Great,Marine drive is alled as queens necklace and it's located in South Mumbai area and I totally loved the vibes there
"Marine Drive, Uncomfortable Drive","Once upon a time, the road was concreted, the traffic was light, the signals were coordinated, the lanes were wide. Now the road is unevenly tarred, the traffic is chaotic, the signals are uncoordinated, the lanes are narrow. Bicycles, two-wheelers, old cars etc invariably occupy the fast lanes. People jump across the dividers without warning. The rating is gradually dropping : Excellent to Good to Average....shortly it will be Poor...if the authorities do not do something about it soon."
Awesome late night walk,"Marine Drive is undoubtedly the most popular hangout in Mumbai. It’s very popular in tourist and local people equally. You can enjoy beautiful views. The sun set is wonderful. It’s crowded but very pleasant because it’s strech can accommodate very large number of people. Many local love couples sit here for hours. We visited many times during our stay because of pleasant sea breeze. The best time to visit Marine drive is late night. During the night you will never forget the reflection of  road light  in sea, the cool breeze, sound of crushing waves, vibes around it. If you are visiting late night please note that police vacate the place by 1:30 AM."
Queens necklace ,Marine drive is too cool and superb place just to hang put with any age category..sea view is just beautiful
Just sit by,Gorgeous to sit thru the sunset and then see the entire Mumbai skyline lot in front of you inch by inch... very safe place with enough police roaming around. Must do
Nariman Point to Chowpatty,"Being a local, I have been to Marine Drive many a times and never get bored. The Marine Drive starts from Nariman Point at South end and ends at Chowpatty in the North. It's about 3-4 km drive. Although the drive can be pleasant the real pleasure is seating and enjoying the sunset. The esplanade is crowded most of the time, but you wouldn't mind the crowd and can enjoy the views with some snacks sold by hawkers."
Marine Drive/ the Queen’s necklace ,"We stayed at the intercontinental and the views of Marine Drive were wonderful - early morning walkers, families during the day and couples jostling for seats at sunset and well into the night. And it really does look like it’s nickname, the Queens necklace, when it’s all lit up at night. Beautiful."
love the Marine drive,loved it beautiful drive except if you get caught in the traffic ..very clean ..January is not the month to have a clear view of the Queens necklace as there was an over cast
Marine drive,Beautiful drives with lots of shopping and food outlets Very neat and tidy areas People are so friendly however the downside are the sales people that force you to enter shops as they obtain a commission
Great,"Marine drive , famous place and also crowded with tourist and local peoples, great atmosphere for enjoying few hours"
Bling bling,"Known as the ""Queen's necklace"" as its semi-circular shape looks like a beautiful piece of jewelry at night when it is lit up.Stunning sight"
A pleasant walk along the drive but not much else.! ,We went for a walk along the drive. Not much to see in the harbour and we couldn't see the buildings across the harbour due to the smog.!Wouldn't recommend this.
Beautiful. ,"Lovely sunset, very clean and great views over the Arabian Sea. Fantastic. Peace full in a very busy city. Worth a visit and walk on the promenade."
Night life place,If in Mumbai you have not spend your night life here then must go and visit. This place is famous to spend the best night life. There is always a crowd over there. One can find some massage person and many thing more
Nice place to visit,Any we can visit the Marine drive but morning and evening are best time to visit Marine Drive. We will experience fresh sea with sun rise between 5 am - 8 am.

Most calm n relaxed place in whole Mumbai,"Be with friends, family, girlfriend or just come alone you will always feel the calmness n relaxation.Rainy season is the most i love to visit here.Standing here one would always have the hope n belief that he can own this city or atleast become successful."
Beautifull,I would recommend visiting this place just before midnight. Warm tea with the midnight stars and street lights hit u in a different way. Bring out the love for mumbai
One of the iconic landmarks of Mumbai.,"A visit to Mumbai will be incomplete without a stop over at Marine Drive .Also called 'Queen's Necklace ' as maybe that is how it appears from up above .Over the years it has been cleaned up and maintained well ,one can go for a morning or evening stroll,jogging and enjoy the gentle breeze .However it can be quite crowded depending on the time of the day ,also on weekends"
heart of mumbai,"marine drive is the best place to visit when you in mumbai, even before the sea link this was the most important tourist attraction of mumbai.many movies are shot at this iconic site of mumbai.go in the evenings to see the beautiful sunset and chill by the water. and little at the night go towards walkeshwar to view this marine drive in a new site ""The Queens Necklace."" it's beautiful."
Peaceful Place,A very calm and peaceful place in the heart of Mumbai to spend some quality time. The sunset view is the best of all to experience.
Queens Necklace in Night,Also known as Queens Necklace in the night for a beautiful drive along the sea although high traffic conjunction during office hours
Rejuvenating Therapy,"It’s a great place to sit around and watch the sunset. It’s lively to see so many people around. You will find people jogging, friends chit chatting, families spending time together, children playing. Mumbai police keeps patrolling so is safe."

Great to walk in the evening,Watching sunset on marine drive is amazing. You can walk for a hour with beautiful sea view and feel great! Only missing part was absence of local vendors with amazing local food.
A Must Vist,The Marine Drive is a must visit if one is visiting Mumbai.The entire curve seems like a necklace and it is best viewed at sunset. Take a taxi or travel by local train to churchgate .It's walking distance from th station .
Just another part to the Mumbai puzzle,"Not exhilarating,  but good to get a wider view of the city. Apparently and unfortunately could be a lot more impressive minus the smog haze."
go to see the sun set,"in the daytime, the area is very quiet but it comes alive at night. go to the beach and try the street food"
Typical Mumbai ,"Typical Mumbai walk and hang out spot for locals. Boardwalk of Mumbai. Beautiful sunsets. Many dogs, joggers, lovers, and families."
Pride of Mumbai,Marine drive is the most prestigious roads in South Mumbai.Along the Arabian sea it has nice pavment to walk or sit on sea side.Evening with sunset is fabulous.Don't leave city without walk at marine drive.

A Nice Walk !,"The best place in town. Inspite of the thousands and thousands of people who throng this place, you will always have your own privacy.

Awesome place,I have never been to a place where it's so calm and amazing. The gigantic waves took me to the different world altogether.
Sea front,"Everyone goes here, it is one of the nicer places in Mumbai, it was very very busy, a bit noisy but obviously a place people go to be seen and lovers go to sit and gaze out to sea."
Best view of sea and city,Visit the place in the evening. The sea view is best and most clean.  Enjoy the scenery with Bhelpuri  and similar things .
Mumbai Marine drive was well worth the....,Mumbai Marine drive was well worth the wait via toll and travel waiting due to traffic.  Please have money ready for the toll road is my advice.
Good place to visit during night time,My family and my brother’s family visited the Marine Drive in the month of Dec...the best time to visit this place is either early morning or late evening. We had visited it during late night and it had a stunning view...no wonder it is also know as the queen’s necklace because of the streetlights in a semi circle fashion...the only downside is that there is no parking place to park you mr car and enjoy a leisure walk
New year's eve,Worth every moment of visual pleasure to be with your loved one at this pearl.Although a bit crowded but beauty of it is the hustling crowd soaking every bit of Bombay.Worth a peep surely.
Marine Drive,Best for sunrise and sunset walksLots of people come for walks jogs and catch up with friends Good relaxing atmosphere

Queens Necklace,The place is a beautiful site for travelers as it runs along the shore of the Arabian sea. This is of maximum beauty at night as the street light give it a shape of a shimmering necklace.
Jewel of Mumbai,"There must be a reason for this to be called a jewel of mumbai. The first visit of mine, a I am in love with it. Really calm and beautiful just to relax and sit here and ponder upon the beautifull scenery of Mumbai ."
Free Escape from the City,"As you know, Mumbai is a busy city. If you need free escape, you may visit Marine Drive. Sit, chill, and feel the wind here. Best time to visit is golden hour because it won't be too hot. Other advise, you may bring some food & beer here. There are some foot massagers who walk around if you want lil bit reflexology. Hope this help ;)"
A must when in Mumbai,Watching the sunset from Marine Drive is one of the best memories I take with me from Mumbai. Simply stunning.
Feel the sea breeze ,Best time to visit is before sunset. Just feel the sea breeze and watch the huge Arabian see.As the sun goes down the crowd increases and the semilunar shape of the city lights up like a queens necklace.You feel so peaceful inspite of surrounded by people.The queen necklace view is actually jaw dropping.when in marine drive rustoms ice cream is a must try.
Pleasant and tree filled,It is chilly in the morning and cold at night.It is worth visiting for its view of the Arabian sea.At  night  the light shines like diamonds.I was walking on the parapet wall with my family members it was so beautiful.
Spectacular views,"Marine drive is a must visit while coming to mumbai and one can sit back and relax.... Especially during the evenings, you will witness lot of ppl jogging, sitting, chit chatting etc. Overall a great place...."
Pleasant evening at Marine Drive - glamour & glitter of the city,"On 22nd Sep'19, a fine Sunday evening, myself with my hubby visited Marine Drive - glamour & glitter of the city. Marine Drive is actually 3.6 km long, arc-shaped boulevard along the South Mumbai coast that starts at the southern end of Nariman Point and ends at Girgaum Chowpatty, popularly known as Chowpatty BeachWe had a relaxed walk there in the evening. It was more crowded due to weekend. The sound of the waves, a view of the Mumbai skyline and the starry sky easily make Marine Drive one of the most romantic spots in the city. Enjoyed the pleasant evening at this romantic spot."
Beautiful,"Beautiful especially at night. Many families and couples come to sit on the wall along the water. Spectacular hotels, boutiques, etc."
Nice views but smell and mosquitos,We probably didn't go to the best area of the marine drive.  The area we went to though had some nice views at night smelled and had lots of mosquitos so wasn't able to enjoy.
Interesting,"I guess this is a place you need to visit at night. Unfortunately we only drove along the length of it during the day so I can only say 'been there, done that'"
Evening stroll lead to a small video shoot,"We were strolling around this place, and then sat at the sitting area. A colllege group came and asked us for a small chipping/ shoot for shunning the patriarchal mindset that boys don't cry. we enjoyed the shoot, this was a kinda different experience. Last year we saw a dance shooting. Hang out there ..no one knows what surprise awaits..."
Stunning view of the Mumbai skyline,"Marine drive is the crowning glory of our city. Lined with Art Deco buildings overlooking the Arabian Sea, it is one of the top attractions in mumbai. Love to sit by the promenade and watch the beautiful sunsets as the world goes by."
Marine drive ,Queens necklace 💓 Amazing place to have a walk with your friends or family members. The place is beautiful and nothing else compares with this place.
Beautiful views! ,Seen on my tour with Magical Mumbai Tours. An amazing way to see the skyline - incredible panoramic views. Wish I could go back around sunset.
Pleasant Morning/  Evening  walk,"Marine drive (MD)one of famous tourist spots in Mumbai, I often visit it. I was staying near Marine drive for 12 years when daily I use to take morning walk along Marine drive. Specially evening time many mumbaikars and tourists visit Marine drive for  walk with pleasant breeze.  While walking along queen's necklace which called popularly one can see vast  view of Arabian sea & on  opposite side famous hotels and heritage buildings. While walking along MD people are in their own world. MD clean, spacious pedestrian road without any food / hawker stall is the best tourist place. Specially on rainy days walking on marine drive one can feel like in walking in heaven. One can sit and chat with friends for many  hours on the wall of MD."
Never ending sea view Great Marine Drive😍,"This is one of the famous places in Mumbai. It has a beautiful never ending sea view. It has a very long stretch of pathway surrounding the Arabian Sea which resembles like a Queen 's necklace.Night time is a best time to see it.we walk thereand visited many places near marine drive such as Narima Point, Malabar hills, babulnath temple etc. all places have more crowd  and no privacy . I don't like these places. It is a safe place and one thing is best of this place is many Bollywood stars are also walk there in early morning jogging."
Breeze,Superb place to nightout chill. You can sit here as long as you want and you never think of moving out from this place
Nice spot for some relaxation!!,After a tiresome morning in gateway and Elephanta one does require a rest.  But after that you can head to the Marine drive.

Amazing place,"One of the best sea view, had a great evening watching sun set and just at start of Marine drive is Chowpati beach heaven for foodies."
"Nice, but could use some shade trees","It’s a nice corniche, with lovely views of the city and the Arabian Sea.  Given how hot it is in Mumbai, it would be nice it there were more shade trees along the way.  Also, there are not really places to stop and grab a drink right along the way."
Famous place for time spent,Marine drive is famous place and area for time spent with family. Beautiful view of sea. We have seat and enjoyed there with friends.
Worth a long walk ,We done this walk at sunset and it was excellent.The sun set is brilliant and it’s a very nice walk with the Mumbai sky line in view.Would recommend doing this if you are in Mumbai. But start north and work down south for the best views of the sunset

Victoria's Necklace,"I was incapacitated and sitting in my room in the Intercontinental hotel and I had a great view of the bay.  Not a moment passed when there was something to watch, a constant procession of colourful families and young people walking up and down, especially at weekends and evenings.  There was constant beeping from the traffic along Marine Drive which lends an atmosphere at night."
A must visit,"If you are in Mumbai, you must visit this place. A great place to be at in the evening. You can go for a walk, sit and watch sunset, relax and listen to music... whatever. You won't be disappointed."
A Disappointment,"I was told that the view at night when it lit up like a necklace is amazing, but as I could only visit during the day I was disappointed.  The sky was heave and gray from pollution. Impossible to take a photo."
Beautiful,If you are in Mumbai don’t forget to visit here . It’s a beautiful place in Mumbai . I visited here with my kids . I visited here at night time and it was looking very very beautiful . We felt relaxed and happy after visiting here.
Fantastic Views,One gets fantastic views of the surroundings of South Mumbai when one drives over Marine Drive. It is a historical place. Certainly would very highly recommend experiencing a drive over Marine Drive to anyone when in Mumbai.
It's ok for a walk.,"when we visited chowpatty beach we walked a bit of marine drive, If im honest it was a bit boring, i thought things would be happening in the area but it really is just a long walk in a nice area, nothing special at all."
Iconic Drive,One of the best routes to drive on in Mumbai.Great for walking & jogging in the early hours.Not very crowded .Offers the view to the sea and you can see the skyline of the Malabar hill's well as the Nariman point.You pass by the Taroporewala Aquarium.
All about being single ,My one of the most favourite place marines . It started with my 11th std and it is stilll going on. No replacement found. A place to sit and watch sunset. Listen song and walk. noticing each and every person by giving smile☺️.
Marine Drive,"I walked it during the day and then Amish from Mumbai Moments took me up to a great spot after dark and showed me the Queens Necklace. A more spectacular scene, I have never seen. The lights of Bombay reflected in the Sea. If you go to Bombay, you cannot miss the beauty of Marine drive during the day and Queens Necklace by night.I didnt take any pictures of the Queens Necklace, I will for ever have the beauty of that scene forever etched in my mind."
Queens neclace,An iconic road along the arabian sea in south mumbai also called the queens neclace die to the glitter of lights by night.
Great place to walk,Enjoy walking down the shore to the sound of the waves lashing the shore. Beware of few beggars who will keep pestering you to give them alms. But otherwise breezy and relaxing atmosphere
Just immeasurable experience. ,"There are certainly most cherishing moment's I have had with the marine drive , which are undoubtedly etched in my mind.As I was staying at a hostel near churchate it was just few meters away. In fact we were most privileged as we could enjoy the Marine drive whenever we thought of visiting it .Especially for the morning walks or for the evening walks. As I am the most romantic person I would undoubtedly visit marine drive in the evenings with my girl friends watching the sunset and having a long chat. The scene at the sunset was always most amazing. The sky turned golden and the sun piercing it's colourful rays through the clouds made the sky look  just outstandingly beautiful. Perhaps most unique. I may certainly say that I am most privileged person witnessing the sunset with the waves hitting the shores .The sounds of the waves made the scene look more real and amazingly vibrant. These pleasures are definitely immeasurable."
Must visit ,One must see and experience marine drive in Mumbai. beautiful sea view and best place in Mumbai for chill. It look superb at night
Lovley,Nice place to go for a walk along or sit. It provides a great view of the city and open ocean. Would recommend!
Queens Necklace,"It's awesome. Popularly known as queens Necklace. It's very nice and has a soothing effect. Especially evenings are even nicer. Just be careful don't stay very late night. Great view, fresh sea breeze and nice topography."
Nice walk ,"Nice place to walk late afternoon / sunset time. I would recommend staying on the path, as the beach is very dirty."
cool place,"This is a really clean and well managed area to visit and it gets very busy later in the day.  The atmosphere is great and there are so many things to look at, spend money at, or do along the way.  A good stop over when in town."
Queens necklace ,One of the most visited places in Mumbai that is famous across India . This place is simply amazing go there be it any time of the day during the week it will always offer a new experience. I looks like a queen necklace in night . Be it a morning run or night out with your friends or a walk with your special ones by the side of the sea this place never disappoints you.
A breath of fresh air,"Can spend hours sitting at this place in front of the sea, where the breeze keeps coming making it even better. Plenty of street foods to try out. All in all, a good place to go with friends or even alone."
Amazing Subset and Views,Don’t miss this n one of your tours of Mumbai to the south. The locals still call this area Bombay and they are sticking to that name with a great deal of pride.  The streets here are as clean as those in Singapore and equally as safe.
Nice place,An evening in Marine drive Mumbai is fabulous.Very beautiful view in night. Lot of shops and eatery's around.
Busy City Life on the sea side,"I stayed in Trident so Marine drive was next door. I had the luxury of time to spend by the bay and it was such a wonderful experience. The drive is smooth, people around are nice and life is at ease with this clean place and winds around. Must go and experience place in Mumbai."
Stunning view and the peaceful breeze,"One of the Best place to visit post sunset in Mumbai. The most calming place with a beautiful skyline view. I have been there during sunrise, at midnight, in evening and everytime it has a charm of its own. The calmness contradicts the rush of Mumbai, hence peaceful. Also on high tides the water splashes on u which is quite fun."
Calm and beautiful,"As a person who was born in a coastal city, I was not expecting anything special when I visited the Marine drive. But I get why Mumbaikers flock to this place. It's serene. It's calm which is rare in this city. You feel relaxed think beyond your immediate worries and try to chill there. I'm a person who when visits a beach make it a point to have some some fun with the waves, walk barefooted on beach. So was pretty disappointed to find that such beaches are harder to come by in Mumbai. It's either dirty or waves are harsh. So it was a different experience for me!"
Crowded but more beautiful only in daytime,"Crowded throughout the day. More scenic in daytime than night. Skyline is like the usual city but not well-lit at night. Overall, I would say worth going only during day time."
Queen's necklace.,Beautiful view all around this drive with Armenian sea at one side and beautiful heritage structures on other side.A clean beach maintained by corporation and Paradise for walkers.My favourite place always.
Evening at Marine Drive,A great place to spend the evening with family. Vendors are there to serve tea and light tit bits.one can see the famous Queens Necklace.

"Nice, quiet walk","Nice quiet walk and we were relatively left alone, I was expecting people would try and sell us things but it didn’t happen once. Very busy but worth a walk down while you’re here. Took about half an hour start to finish."
Traveling,"Best place for chilling with friends..located in South Mumbai also known as queens necklace, because at night the bright yellow lights looks like the golden neckless.."
Great drive,Stayed at the Oberoi Mumbai. Loved the view from our suite   Loved the vibe of the area. Our driver enlightened us as to the beauty and use of the area around the drive
Hmmm,"Well coming from the land down under where the water is blue and beautiful, it was a little difficult to see the beauty here. I wish there was less rubbish in the water. The locals really love marine drive, and love hanging around getting slashed by the water. The positive was there was alot of restaurants to choose from."
What a great place,"Awesome place to sit and relax on the edge wall, hanging your feet onto the sea side and have a great life thought.Approx 10 mins walkable distance from churchgate local railway station."
Calm in the chaos!,People usually come here to sit and ponder over thoughts while enjoying the beautiful view of the sea waves.
Place to calm your mind,"I visited this place after 1 am to experience the wind and sea noise to nurture mind, well the wind actually works your some part of mind would relax just sitting there and doing nothing"

Happiness,Who doesn't like to sit somewhere close to nature.Marine Drive is basically the perfect place to sit to chill and get relief from chaos.I am very frequent visitor to this place.Mostly we drive at night with friends and sit there for hours just fell the beautiful breeze and sound of deep ocean.

Joy ride after a shower,The night view of marine drive after a shower for a late night drive is a thrill by itself. The glittering roads with reflection all through will give a boost to your romantic mood.

A bus tour of Mumbai ,"We were on a tour and the driver and guide took us along Marine Drive which the guide said has a kick name referring to Miami.Following the bay, the road has fantastic views of the ocean and the guide said that lots of people gather there to watch the sun go down.We didn't stop to get off the  bus, but there is a path that runs alongside the road for those that want a stroll."

Beautiful Sea Face,"An extremely beautigul sea face which is also known as wueens necklace for its curved road and the lights in the evenings which forms the shape of a necklace. Lovely place in the evenings to face the sea or spend some time cooling off. Opposite are some tall to medium height towers which has some eating joints but are costly. No hawkers zone but is a crowded place every evening. Great for health freaks who enjoy jogging and exercise in the morning. Reachable by public transport and has bus stops like nariman point, charni road, churchgate etc.Amazing place, must spend time here."

A classic Mumbai destination,We walked to Marine drive to have a view of the sea and to feel its cool breezes.  There is no access to the sea here but there is a sea wall that you can sit on.  There is lots of traffic on Marine drive itself and my children delighted in seeing expensive cars driving by.  I've been told it is popular with couples on weekends but we were there on a week day.
Best tourist place in Mumbai,"Whenever I want to have fun with friends I straight away come to this place. This is one of the best and my favourite tourist place in Mumbai. It is near wankhade stadium from here you can see full view of the sea it is very peaceful place with cold breeze you can have fun with your family, friends and with your girlfriend as well. You should definitely visit this place once in your life if you stay in Mumbai."
Queens necklace,My family loves visiting this place during rainy season. It has the best view during rains. The place is so crowded on 31st of December. Must visit during winters in the morning. So cold and chilling.
Heart of Mumbai,It's always Serene to sit or have a walk by the tracks to enjoy fresh breeze and the calmness of Arabian Sea.
Mumbai MERI Jaan ,Marine drive is yet another place where people visit when they are in MUMBAI. This is also popularly known as Queens Necklace.

Nice walk,"It's a nice place to see how people relax no matter day or night. Although the sea is not thst clean or blue, it is ok to spend there a couple of hours."
"""Most visited and  all time time favourite spot in Mumbai""","The Marine Drive is a must walk drive in Mumbai, same way as you love to walk around the Pondicherry beach or the Chennai Marina beach. It's beautiful, not a dull moment as you watch the waves kissing those huge boulders and stones and watching the sunrise or sunset. Unfortunately, we could not enjoy the Sun, but the feel and momentum of the place were unforgettable."
Dancing waves,"It was raining day n night. Young netizens walking, jogging, chatting n singing in groups. Couples enjoying each others company in close proximity. Loan wolves staring blank at distant approaching waves or at black sky thickened with dense cloud. Late night chap left the pavement in favour of early morning health conscious jogging Tom."
Nice,Marine drive it's specially called Queen necklace lovely south Mumbai sea beach it was great weather .lovely place
Relax by the sea at sunset,"If in Mumbai, this is a place to visit in the evening as the sun sets.  As darkness steps n lights switched on, one can hava a view of the Queens Neckless, its a beautiful view so natural n georgous."
Not good for families and young kids,Avoid going to this place. Known as marine drive. Its very famous but police is not taking care of this place. Its not so safely. The guys sitting there are very bad and they are robbers. Its danger to be on marine drive now a days with young kids and families.
Lovely by Night,This is one of the highlights for me every time i stay in Mumbai.A walk or just sitting by the ocean admiring the Skyline.every visitor must experience this.
Mumbai Marine,"If you stay in Mumbai and you don't know the place where you will get peace and fresh vibes, nature to experience the moment of wavy water and to see a beautiful sunset in mumbai....So you must visit Marine Drive, it is one of the best spot in mumbai, you can reach here through any Railway station between Marineline - Churchgate its all connected. Mumbaikar named it as a Marine Drive which is very famous all around world its lies in southern mumbai near coastal area, whole area is designed in C shape covering the Coastal sea there's a huge sitting area made of concrete, where you can sit lying your legs down, facing the sea enjoying the cool breeze makes you stay there for as long as you want, you can take a walk to explore all around marine drive ,you can find all rocks shaped as a Tetrapod (structure) down balance the waves of sea.....Its very wonderfull experience, whenever I visit here,I vanished all my stress before going back home"
Beach in the city,Last 15 years I have gone to Juhu numerous times. I remember the first beach I saw in my life is Juhi beach so it has its own importance even though I have seen many in country and outside. It's not great beach as far as it's maintenance or beauty is concerned but it's one of the refreshing spot in the crowd capital of India. You can take a sigh of relief forgetting hustle bustle of Mumbai once their. There are numerous hotel along Juhu beach and I stayed in some like J W Marriott and Sun N Sand etc. The USP of all these hotels are the same location along Juhu beach. Mumbai visit without Juhu beach is incomplete.
Nice beach,"Marine drive is nice beach. Here many people are come to visit this place. This place is really nice, clean and peaceful. You can go alone to enjoy the cold fresh air, with your partner if you want to be in a romantic place or with your friends for having good quality fun. Amazing place.Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long Boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai, India. The road was constructed by late philanthropist Bhagojisheth Keer & Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay."
Beauty of Mumbai,Marine Drive is the beautiful place in Mumbai to chilled out and enjoy the time with friends and family. Every one should go there and take some fresh air.
Good place,A very iconic bridge availbale in Mumbai which is a symbol for Mumbai and also very provides good view.
Relaxing Walk Along The Front,A nice Sunday afternoon spent walking along the seafront admiring the views and the expensive residences littered along the way.Be careful if you are a smoker as you will be fined - not all lost as you can always bribe the officials (who are already on a good salary) and this is easy money for these jobsworths so you can get away with paying half the amount of the fine...
Marine Drive is the best place to visit,"Best place for friends , family and couples.I had been many times and still not boredFresh Air.It is near Wankhede Stadium and located in churchgate"
To a peaceful day!,"There are times in life when you feel low, upset about everything that happens with it! Quite a lot of times, I get such feelings too, at such hours, this place is my only rescue! For a lot of people, it's just a long sitting belt near the seaside, but for lot others this place is spot for lot of lessons! When I feel upset, I often go here, all alone, but always return back making some friends! Some dogs, some crows, some little vendors! This place juz gives me peace and another level of satisfaction! It looks all the more beautiful at night! Trust me,this queen's necklace shines brighter than the one she wears it down her throat! And besides,have you heard that sound of waves gushing up to the rock, or the sound of the wind twirling in your ears, those sunrays during a cloudy monsoon morning? It's literally the ray of hope for us! Isn't it? This place is serene and the cleanest one in Mumbai, great place for long strolls and jogging, catching up with friends and spending time with your loved ones, a place to sit alone and introspect! And after a dosage it always makes me feel better! Like it did to me just yesterday! 😄"
Queen's necklace is beautiful!,"Marine drive if observed from height looks like a necklace and hence is called queen's necklace also. It has got a very positive vibe. You can enjoy even if you come here all by yourself. Take a stroll on the long promenade from churchgate to charniroad or simply sit on the promenade sitting area to view the wide expanse of Arabian sea, enjoyment is guaranteed! So many people flock here - joggers, friends, couples, groups, singles, locals, foreigners, young and old. All come with different mood but go back with positivity and smile!"
Awsome place,This place very good and a must see for every visitor visiting mumbai as this gives a very good view.
Evening stroll ,Marine drive is a place which gets crowded during evening hours with couples. It can be easily reached by public transport. I clicked some good photos of Arabian sea from here.
Chill. Sit. Relax. ,It is the most renowned place to sit and chill in Mumbai. You can sit with your friends and hear the sound of the waves. You are not allowed to sit here from 3-4 at night.
A perfect place to hang out,It's a beautiful sea side place to hang out. You can sit and enjoy the cool breeze and the sound of waves. There's a choupaty on the end of the Marine drive where you can have different types of Indian food and desserts.
Brezzing Sea,"A wonderful sineary of sea give a exceptional joy and the dazzling air let you relax you can walk along it give you relax feeling can seat there as much you want, can think about yourself nicely.Good place to visit in Mumbai"
Refreshing,We were brought here late morning by our private tour driver. It was a very pleasant sunny day and the breeze was so refreshing. This time of the day was fairly quiet so we made the most of it.
"You can experience a clear divide between the  hustle bustle, chaotic traffic & peace","Marine Drive is a must visit not just for Non Mumbaikars but also for every Mumbaikar residing in the different and long , extended stretches of the city. As you sit on the shore, if facing the sea you can witness sunset and the beautiful hues that colour the sky each evening. You also get to see the finest buildings of South Mumbai alongside the long coast. Wait till sunset and witness the street lights adorn the entire stretch and then you will probably understand why it is also known as the queens necklace. And if you sit facing the road with the sea behind you, what you will witness is the rushing & honking of cars each wanting to drive faster than the other. You will also find people going for their daily walks and some jogging as well.  It is the place that has a clear divide between chaos and peace with you  in the centre with the option of choosing from both. There are also very few hawkers these days. Best time to visit is 6 pm onwards to visit the sunset or in the rains, with the waves splashing water all over the shore too. Especially in monsoon, If you are lucky, you may find a hawker selling fresh hot corn cobs."

Mumbai - marine drive,"MUMBAI!!!!AKA Capital of Indian economy.It is said that if you survived in Mumbai you can survive in any city of the country.  So many different languages , different culture, bollywood celebs and many more. This city got every thing you can see in an normal country. This city has skyscrapers as well as on the other side it has slums like playing snake ladder.  People over here are always in a race, race for catching local or race for finding a good job or race for grabbing “vada pav” at food street. It’s true that Mumbai never sleep, people are out of there homes at midnight hours enjoying the blissful breeze at marine drive (queen’s necklace).  Most of people are humble and helping but some are rude and mean . But one thing is common in every mumbaikars i.e. love and hate for rains. They wait for it desperately and when it get started at its upmost level  at the same time people  start hating it.  This is how life is in Mumbai."
"Queens's Necklace or Marine Drive , must visit place in Mumbai","I had travel almost 25km to visit this place and it was amazing , people from mumbai come to  this place for night out and i had found many groups who were sitting their and singing , we can enjoy with your bae , as the sunset and cool breeze help you to relax and enjoy together."
Queen's Necklace Marine Drive,Great place to hangout with your friends or family. You will get Awesome climate in rainy season. One of the popular places in Mumbai. Also it is famous for its stunning Queen's Necklace like view.
Nice End to A Hot Day,This is a great way to end a hot day. The breeze coming off of the water is cooling and relaxing. Go before sunset so you can grab a place to sit on the wall. It fills up so go early and catch the beautiful views.
Blissful Evenings,"If you wish to have blissful evenings with your family or your loved ones, head straight to Marine Drive during sunsets. While sitting on the promenade facing the sea, you will surely forget all your worries and look forward to the sight of the setting sun. Have spent hours over here, chatting with my wife about random stuff in our lives. You will surely have the best conversations here with your friend or lover."
A very popular place for the locals to exercise and hang out,"A MUST visit location in Mumbai. I went there, early AM (8:00) and again, after 7:00 PM. The place was bustling at night. A good vibe and great views. In the AM, there were less numbers of people, but many were exercising and walking to keep fit."
Bustling yet peaceful.,"This place has a special corner in the heart of every Mumbaikar. It is a perfect way to escape the busy and hectic life of the city. Even in the middle of a huge crowd, you can feel one with the sea and one with yourself!"
Another life,A place where relations are created. A place where people hangout with their loved ones. A walk by the sea with fresh breeze is always the best with the sound of waves and the feeling of sand on your feet
Spectacular,Marine Drive is the best place in Mumbai. It looks amazing at night and is aptly called the Queen's Necklace. The rickshaw ride was a memory of lifetime.
Fun place to be,Fun place to be with family and friends. Long walk way good exercise. Didn't find any mischief mongers
Universal Spot,"Yes it’s a true Universal Spot...and is a very unique one in the sense that one side of it is a very busy heavy traffic road separated by a wide walkway cum footpath from a very Beutiful part of Sea. South of Bombay originating Near the Gateway Of India, the Marine Drive is a very Beutiful place to sit/ walk around or even Jog... and you can find people of all age groups doing so indifferent of each other. Morning and Sunset time are the best and during rain it is best for Couples.Peaceful morning, Bustling Sunset and a Glorious Necklace view in lights at Night with the Mumbai Skyscrapers standing tall and Handsome!"
Just Crazy Place,far too busy by any standards! I wouldn't rate food any special neither the crowd but I assume this is that Mumbai is!

Pleasant in evenings,It's actually a half kilometer road alongside the sea with rocks in the edges.the night atmosphere here is very beautiful with city view and lot of people usually hangout here.
Always favorite place...,"When you feel hot anywhere in Mumbai,, Go there and feel fresh and cold air...As my title says,, my favorite place is Mumbai and Marine drive..."
An evening spent well on Chaupati,"Who does not love Marine Drive and Chuapati?  Everyone who live in Mumbai or visitor to the city wants to go to Marine drive. Best sunset view point, Enjoy Paani puri and bhel puri along with sunset.For enjoying queens necklace...one must go to Hanging Gardens , Walkesshwar."
Oceans Hug!,"Marine Drive also known as the Queens necklace is definitely a must go zone if you are in Mumbai. The view of the sea along with corn or tea to relish your throat  just adds up to the beauty of the place. Visit during the day may turn out hot and sweaty unless it's rainy. According to my experience, late night visit is really peaceful, calm and quiet. Since, the traffic and crowd is minimum at night so the place becomes more relaxing. Hope this help you all. Have fun!!!"
"Beautiful views, beautiful people!",Take a stroll down the Queens Necklace in the last hour or two before dusk ... see Mumbai's young and those who are tretching their legs. All of Mumbai is to be seen here!
Beautiful in monsoons,"Marine Drive is always beautiful, but it's charm increases in monsoon even more.All nice eateries are close by and every accessable from Churchgate station.One can easily get a cab also.Even their are neat and clean washroom facility on the stretch."
Super fun,"I had been to marine drive with my family and 18 month old daughter.  She was seeing water body for the first time and I must say my daughter loved it...  She was not ready to get down the promenade and the best part was,  it started raining. We all enjoyed a lot in rains and it was my daughter's best outdoor trip. It was super clean and hardly any hawkers to bother you. It is indeed the one of the best places we have in Mumbai."
Old and evergreen Charm,You will love this place from childhood to adulthood.Simplely because one side sea and otherside skyline remain same.
best place to sit and enjoy sea when in mumbai,"must visit place in Mumbai to enjoy sea view both in morning,evening or when its raining.just sit and enjoy sea."
Cool breeze,"It is one of the most popular places in Mumbai to hang out or chill. The amazing sound of wave, chilling breeze and the crowd will make you day and you will love coming to this place again and again. Specially on weekends."
Mumbai,"What would I say about this place😍Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long Boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai, India. The road was constructed by late philanthropist Bhagojisheth Keer & Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay."
Pleasant evening,"A visit to Mumbai will be incomplete with going to Marine drive. We went in early evening to enjoy sunset and stayed till the magnificent lights came on.I wish the high pollution level is brought down so that we can enjoy looking endlessly at the sea, listen to the sound of the waves and enjoy the occasional splash of water."
Amazing view.,"Words can't express the feeling of seeing it is reality. Such a big circle around the beach, proper cemented bench to sit on and so many people siting to have a view of sun set..........My surely first experience to see sun set with so many people together....Night view is even better, try to see it both time, in day as well as night."
 Queen's Necklace,"Marine drive is a famous spot along the coastline of Arabian Sea. Road is about 3 km long. It is one of the most famous spot in Mumbai, a great place to watch sunset. And it looks awesome when lit up and that's why it's called ""Queen's necklace"". The view is really stunning at night. The distance from Churchgate railway station to Marine Drive is 2.1km and it would take you about 10 minutes to reach by auto or car. If you decide to walk it would take you around 30-40 minutes to Marine Drive from the station."
Pleasant ,Pleasant place to hang out and relax during sunset. Good place to see Mumbai life. Avoid going in the afternoon.
Zindagi beet jayegi samudra ko dekhte dekhate,Its that place which fills you with positive energy. Just go observe sea waves listen to the nature & it's music.
Best attraction of Mumbai ,I would definitely say that Marine Drive is one of the best attraction of Mumbai. You just need to ensure that you visit this place at night after your dinner or even more late.
