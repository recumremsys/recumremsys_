Also, there are a lot of fun activities to do inside the garden:* Swings*Laser Show*Tasty food*walking paths*Kankaria Zoo*Mirror MazeIt is open from Tuesday to Sunday. (Monday being closed).Also, there is an entry fee of Rs25 for adults and Rs 10 for children above 3 years.P.S- I would personally recommend to visit it in the evening as it is very hot during the day time."
Wow.....,Kankaria Lake.. A great place to go out for  a walk or jogging or sit .. great natural place so nicely maintained.
revive child hood memories,"It was great to come after so many years, took a train ride and saw all the attractions ,balvatika etc"
Perfect evening walk,The place has been really well developed making it perfect to spend some time here. The. Lake is well maintained and the laser show in the evening attracts a lot of crowd. The eateries serve decent food at reasonable price. The place is generally crowded but a morning or an evening walk here is always worth the efforts. The place also has a lot of rides and attractions for kids helping them to spend a lot of time here.
Just beautiful,I visited Kankaria lake with my grandchildren and we enjoyed a lot ..it was very beautiful with lovely fountains.. we have to buy ticket to enter...zoo and Bal vatika and so many places to enjoy with kids.
Perfect place to spend your evening,"A well designed place with many options that you can't cover in a day as the day starts in the evening here due to high temperature in the presence of sun but this place has very good options like toy train, Zoo, fish aquarium, boating, cycling, kids zone and many more.... Wow"
Ahmedabad's Own Lake,"Enjoyed toy train ride all the lake around, ahmedabad's own locals lake in between the centre of the city, always crowded with locals, so many eateries, parachute ride - my favorite one. had a good time there."
Fun place and must visit.,Great place for the kids and family to hang out. Careful with the rides as just heard the incident once we were done with our trip. Too much rush though!
Awesome trip,"If you want to visit kankaria lake than u have to spend full day here.lots of rides,botting,zoo,water park.we also seen fountain dance.every one should visit once."
Really really nice place to hang out!,It is nice to spend a morning here along the lake! It is huge! Can have a train ride all around the lake... but I think it should have stops so people can see other places as well! I could see the place on the center unfortunately... had to walk a lot to get there from the entrance I came from!
Nice Lake ,"It was a nice visit in the evening, nice boat ride in the lake, very neatly maintained. Nice boat facility. With a zoo attached and children play area"
It's a beautiful and famous spot,"Picnic spot in Ahmedabad. Very beautiful and famous. There is zoo, rides near by this place. Enjoyed with family. Small train is main attraction here."
Management should raise the entry charges,Overcrowded as it has just 10-20 rs entry tickets. Such people throws garbage all over. To attach non localities and manage cleanliness the management should raise the charges.
Kankaria visit,Really good place..It's clean and beautiful.It has many things for time pass and enjoyment.Zoo is also good..Nice variety of food available
Nice place,Good place great ambiance at evening time like the place most it is the best place ever I visit Ahmedabad. Really interesting thing is the fish.
Good Place to hangout,"Must visit in Ahmedabad. Big lake with many options in the surrounding area. Atal express train is must to explore all. Zoo, food stalls, boating, amusement parks. Above all Gujarati people are good and very cooperative."
its a good location but pain to reach,its a good location to take kids - though there was a collapse of a ride recently. Its reasonably well maintained and clean. The problem is reaching there if you care staying anywhere in the western part of the city - take a cab. Another problem is lack of clean toilets. Other wise a number of the kiddy attractions are quite good.
Well maintained lake in the heart of the city,Lake is located in heart of the city with sprawling area and with lot of activities including laser light show depicting the culture and tradition of Gujarat.Well maintained and lot of food outlets for your evenings.
Great,Kankaroa lake is one of the iconic best place in the gujarat.its located in maninagar area in ahmedabad .such a lovely lake and its joy train is totally awesome
Excellent outing with the kids,"Went to this place which had plenty of attractions like the zoo, nocturnal zoo, toy train ride, Haunted House, speed boat and many other activities and it was truly a fun-filled experience. Highly recommended for family with kids."
Fully enjoyable place,"Best place for visit with friends and family in Ahmedabad we can spend whole day there with water kingdom, scary house, Adventure sports,zoo and lot more rides for fun..."
Refreshing evening ,"If u r in Ahmedabad , you can’t forget to visit Kankaria lake . The place where every activity is added for each generation , teenagers can take segaway rides and thrilling tree walks , where as small children can take chuk chuk train ride. Boating for every age . Where as adults or elder can take stroll on the sides of lake . No of eating joints for girls and ladies. Clean waters of lake refreshes you up."
Visit,Great place. Nice place to spend time. So many activities to do. Take a speed boat ride and it is cheap. You can take a slow boat ride. Train ride is great. Butterfly park is good. Zorball ride. Lot of eateries and street food. Lighting was very good including lighting show. Very nice for long romantic walk. Very clean well maintained. Toilets are adequate and frequently available. People are helpful and good. Evening visit was very pleasant with all of bird chirping due to lights but return to hotel was little difficult after 8.30 pm due to difficulty in finding ride. Overall experience was good.
Happening and wonderful ,"Was lucky to visit here in last week of December when the Kankaria Carnival was there... it was just a delight.. you get everything live songs performance.. boating, air balloon, night animals zoo (do not miss if you are with your kids)... you get everything... just be ready to spend 4 hours from 6 to 10 in evening for 2/3 days... it was beautiful"
Overly rated - but Yes a Lake with Activities,"In simple terms it is a lake with a good pathway and lots of amusement activities. If you are interested in amusement parks, this may be a place, else mostly touch and go."
Excellent,Very well planned place.There are lot of activities for the kids as well as Adults.lots of food stalls also.
Most Happening place in Ahmedabad,"Well visited on 31st December 2019, overcrowded, but enjoyed a lot, my kids enjoyed a train ride, speed boat here"
Best Place for kids and adults alike,"This place has lots of activities for kids and adults like boating, toy train, cycling, amusement park and many more. Lots of food joints are available with a aide range of fast food, icecreams and beverages."
A day out for picnic ,"A place meant for all. Specially for kids it is the place to enjoy many things in one go. This includes boating , toy train , Zoo , and food too. The only thing is , it will take almost 4 to 5 hours if one needs to check all."
Nice place,It was a very nice place to visit. Enjoyed the train ride and boat ride. No digital payment for purchasing the train ride tickets. People will have to buy the tickets with cash only.Boat ride digital payment was accepted
Another must visit place in Ahmedabad ,Well to start with this is a huge place with many things to do so if you want to visit then you got to ensure few things:1) be prepared to walk a lot2) make sure u have good walking footwear to give you less stress to your legs3) many things to do so make sure you give enough time atleast from noon to nightMust things to do:1) Kamala Nehru Zoo2) Nocturnal Zoo3) Segway ride (90 inr for 100 meter ride)4) laser light show5) boating6) train ride around the park7) njy the birds flying formation in the eveningThere are many other things to do too but didn't have time for it.
Carnival,Very nice place and nice decorations in kankaria carnival very nice performance by kirridanbhai gadhvi
Clean lake within the city,"Entry is on payment. Hence, the place is very clean. It also has a zoo and games for children. Zorba Ball is also available. Entry fee for zoo is separate. There are tigers, lions, bears, foxes, crocodiles, deers. There is a train which is supposed to go around the lake. It wasn't working when I visited. The speed boat ride is a rip off. For a ride lasting less than 5 minutes, one has to shell out Rs.130 per person!One should compare this lake with Hussain Sagar lake which is in the middle of Hyderabad city. It stinks to high heavens. Telangana government should take a leaf from Kankaria Lake maintenance and try to improve Hussain Sagar."
Kankariya karnival ,It's very important place  for ahemadaba city.. in the zoo and more special animal..in the big lack in the boat
"Once a shabby lake, now centre of attraction for all age groups","Completely turned around lake, is now centre of attraction for all age groups. Water sports, rides, boating - slow & fast, baloon ride (opens only if wind speed supports), various food served at the eateries.People can jog around, children can choose rides as per their age group. Senior citizen can relax sitting in garden. Toy train rides also available. Whether family or friends or young couples, all are welcomed here. Children can also experience fire trucks, BRTS, ice-cream manufacturing etc in a private auditorium.It get lit by lights during the evening - just looks like a new bride.Dont miss whenever in Ahmedabad, while locals already are enjoying it."
Great place.. A real good example of what Indian cities can be,A very good family place with lots of fun activities for kids. The Nocturnal zoo was a great experience. Will take couple of hours to see the place. Each city should have a place like this. Kudos to Ahmedabad corporation and Gujrat government for developing such a beautiful city
Completely renovated with many attraction spots,The lake is completely renovated in last few years...Here you can get the good natural view of lake.with cold breeze on your face...The lake is having numerous food stall in it's circumference with many rides...Major.ride is hot air balloon and train ride of full lake...Best picnic spot..
Biggest attraction of Ahmedabad,Kankariya lake is biggest attraction of Ahmadabad. Many people came here for spending time. Good to visit with family.
Very famous place,This very famous and good attraction in ahmedabad. Must visit with family. There was zoo very near from here. Many people came here for morning walking.
A Great place for picnic,"A great place for picnic and hangout with family and friends, having fun rides, food court, boating, night light show, nocturnal zoo, drinking water, rides for small children"
Could be better,"It was a great location to hangout once it was upgraded with walls and other architectural stuff. Now its not maintained properly and cleaned ineffectively, which makes the water body smell"
nice happening place,its one of the very happening place in ahmedabad there are mutiple food and ride options available inside the park
"Although I enjoyed it, I would have to say that it was more for families with children","Kankaria Lake is an amusement park built around a large circular man made lake. When I visited with my friend, many of the activities didn’t seem to be in operation, possibly because it was low season. My friend and I did partake in the speed boat ride, archery and the butterfly park. The latter was just about the worst butterfly park I’ve ever seen. It’s mainly a garden area and yes there are a few butterflies, but there’s not structure where you’d find lots of them.The whole area is a clean and peaceful place. Although I enjoyed it, I would have to say that it was more for families with children."
Good place,Excellent place to spend some quality time with family and kids. Small train ride good food stalls good walking path. A must when u visit Ahmedabad
Enjoyed...,"We get full enjoyment here, games, toy train, a very large option for food, a complete full day enjoyment here..."

Best Place To picnic ,"This is the Best place to one day picnic , too Good Place , nice Amusement park , nice Rides and many more thing s there.."
Must Visit Place,One of the must visit place in Ahmedabad. Hosts multiple activities around and in the lake. Enough for one whole day outing.
Kankaria Nocturnal Zoo is horrible,We visited the nocturnal zoo expecting large enclosures where animals could roam with a recreated habitat. Instead animals were in close to bare cages going nuts walking round and round. Disclaimer: I'm not sure if they have another larger enclosure where they can roam during off zoo hours. We didn't see any.
Walk Around the Lake,"I do believe it's possible to have more fun here than we did. We entered before sunset and were able to enjoy watching the sun go down over the lake while the bats came flying in looking for dinner. We didn't take the time to enjoy any of the side exhibits such as the zoo or the arcade or boating; however, we had a very pleasant walk around the lake enjoying the views and the breeze. We skipped the evening musical dance number show."
waterbody having 300 years legacy.,"A huge lake having annual big volume of water intake ,which attracts people from nearby city to evening outing.....it has a muslim dargah in the centre and a zoo on one bank ,which visited 58 years back as a child with my family.....to stop the errosion the lake has stone steps embanking , which can be used for evening seating to watch sun rise or sun set..... recently various fun and sports activities are introduced with lot of street food stalls."

Good for time pass.,"I had visited on 14th August'2019 between 12 noon to 3.30 pm. I found nothing there to attract people or something deferent. A simple place to visit in Ahmedabad. They have to do a lot to attract people like boating, water fountain, etc.Zoo is smelling too bad, animal cages are dark & dirty. Finally I feel bad to visit that place."
Kankaria in rainy season ,"Kankaria is the place for all ages, it's a worth time spending spot, it got good gardens, a toy train, a zoo, a wonderland, boating and tasty food, everything is at the same place"

The nicest place in whole of Ahmedabad - Kankaria Lake Front,"for a city with no real legal night life, Kankaria Lake Front is the place to go for a sun downer.   Actually it is an absolutely delightful place to do a sun downer minus the booze.   It has plenty of attractions for the complete family, from a lovely zoo to mini train rides, hot air ballooning to boating in the lake, to enjoying some yummy snacks at nagina wadi to a gaming zone.   A vast space of fun which is largely clean, save the bathrooms/toilets which really is a public usage issue."

Must visit place in Ahmedabad,"This is a must visit place if u r traveling to Ahmedabad. Inside the main gate of lake, it exists a whole different world with lots of activities going on for all age group"
Lake,I visited this place several times since my childhood. It changed shapes and became more busy. Don't visit on Mondays. Goid place for children.
Lovely day out,"Kankaria lake is a lovely place to visit to take some time out and enjoy the atmosphere.We went in the early evening so got to see the lake before the sunlight vanished and the place lit up with lovely night lights.There's plenty to do here but after reading other reviews on here we decided to avoid the food outlets which didn't seem that great (they should stop shouting out to tourists trying to get you to eat there as it can get annoying).We had a lovely walk around the lake, a few ice-creams, drinks and even a boat ride!The boat ride was only 130 rupees which is great! But sadly it only lasts about 1 minute so don't expect a long trip.They also have other rides and a funfair section but you need to buy a pass to get into that section so we weren't able to see if it would have been worth the money for us or not.Worth a trip here for a good day out!!"
one of the best place to go with family and kids,"this is probably the best place to go with family, specially with kids, trust me they are going to love it. specially the boating.. and all those food stalls.. i loved it."
It was a pleasant experience,"Entry ticket price - Rs.15I was amazed by the way that AMC has maintained this beautiful lake which offers some fantastic views and opportunity to people of all ages to get involved in some or other activities.You can go for a fast boat ride for Rs.130/person or Jet Ski for Rs.250/person.You can also take a round of the lake by a toy train which is accessible to people of all ages.It has a small theme/adventure park where you can do a combo of 5 rides for unlimited time for Rs.200/person and a combination of 7 rides including the gigantic and mysterious swirl for Rs.360/person.After all this, you can relax in the vast gardens or have some snacks/food at any of the shops lined up along the gravel stones paved pathway."
Good place.... too big to explore completely ,"It was one of the only places where me and my friends had a good time. From rides to zoo to gardens , everything is there. The place is bit costly but worth the time. The place is even good to just chill out or have a memorable time with friends on the lake side."
Alluring Lake,"From childhood, life moves around this lake. Its been transform from small and old culture to modern and new design. Though I really love old lake as during that time no charges, you can eat anything by purchasing and seating on lake chair. Naginawadi was most loved place ever. I really like kankaria lake out of all places visited in my life. Its my true companion of day and night."

Leasure visit with Family,Very nice for Family or Couple outings. The train ride gives a overview of the entire place. Recommended that you stay till sunset.
Amazing Entertainment part,"This is one of the main attraction in Ahmedabad.This lake till a decade back was used to be dry and empty.

Picturesque lake,The lake is excellently maintained with lot of activities for kids and family. Scary house is very good.
Kankaria Lake,"A huge lake within city. There is a lot of other theme based activity surround the lake is available with fee. In fact one need around a half day to cover all these activities the place offer.We found this place too big to cover on walking as the temperature outside was humid & hot. we took the Toy Train to move around which hardly take 15-20 min to take round of entire lake.Wonder why there isn't many water activities are included until now. There is great potential to introduce various Water activities such water scooty, speedy motor boat or even small AC cruise with lunch/Dinner options."
A beautiful Evening,"One of the attraction in Ahmedabad. It was build many years back and it has now been redeveloped by Goverment. Since then this place has been simply amazing. You can spend entire day here. There is Zoo, Balvatika, New zoo. There is a train which takes around 25 min to take one round. Lot of food stalls for street food. Surely to visit place"

There is a famous zoo also."
Students visit,Awesome Toy train rideAtleast 7 times in a year we goes to this place with studentsEveryone like this place
Good place to get out of hussle and bussle of Amedabad traffic ,Good place to chill out and relax. Area well kept and looked after. Very clean. Small entrance fee but worth it. Could do with more eating places
Good,"Kankaria lake , superb place to enjoy few hours, we walk here, and enjoy lots, a must visit place to enjoy a day"
Family Fun,Kankaria Lake is an amazing family spot to go to especially if there are kids with you. There are so many fun activities to do here for both kids and adults. There are food stalls inside that will cover your hunger pangs. Must ride the Atal express (toy train) that circumvents the entire lake. There is a laser light show at Nagina wadi which is great. Visit in the evenings preferably. Kids would love the place.
best place for couple,good atmosphere fantastic arrangements eco friendly and pockets friendly also.all fully cleanliness
Cleanest place you can find in Ahmedabad.A must see for all visitors to Ahmedabad.,"Cleanest place you can find in Ahmedabad.A must see for all visitors to Ahmedabad,Was really surprised to see one of the best places resurrected in Ahmedabad.The lake has Skegway,a real Pontoon boat,circumferential railway,golf carts.It is a novel idea to take a deposit of Rs.10 if you want to take a drinking water bottle inside which will be refunded if you bring the empty bottle whilst exiting."
A Picnic Spot,"A must visit place right in the heart of the city with a lot of activities for all age groups. For those who have seen the lake some years ago and the renovation/facelift that has been given at present would surely appreciate the hard work put into it. Boat rides, toy train, cycling, games, etc. you name it and it has it all. You can gaze at the sunset in the evenings and enjoy the fine array of lighting which is really pleasant and a fun place to chill in the company of family and friends enjoying the various food stalls surrounding this place.

loved the toy train experience,what i didnt like about the traun ride was that it stops no where once you are in the traun it will do a whole round and leave you from.where you started so you basically are unable to enjoy the snacks stalls that they have...nominal ticket charges but they dont have any concessions for the senior citizens as well...i would suggest if you want to enjoy yge snacks dont go for the train ride have snacks and then you can enjoy the ride...the seats in the train are alloted as per the staffs whims wghich is quite not happening

Must visit in Ahmedabad,"We have been visiting this place ever since we were kids. Then it was a total mess but now things have changed completely. Easily accessible by BRTS bus from Paldi, Danilimda,etc, gate number 2 is exactly opposite to Maninagar Bus Stop.Entry fee for adults is 13rs per person and for kids above 3 years, it's another 7/10 odd rupees. To visit this place at leisure, one needs either a full day or at least 7-8 hours. This place is frequented by people of all classes, castes and even by couples (spotted mainly outside the naginawadi laser show)..They have different options for kids of all ages, right from mirror maze till tree climbing, Ahmadabad eye (parachute) till atal express train (Om shanti for Vajpayee's soul), rides, gaming zone etc. Make sure you cross check the prices before entering the mirror maze, it's ridiculously priced at 35 rs for barely anything inside. So is the 35 rs kids zone where rides don't extend for more than 2 minutes. Half of the mirrors in the maze are broken with literally no maintenance at all. They also have various types of boar rides, right from the lowest affordable ones ie 20 rs till 250 rs ie speed boat, all plying on the same circle. Their sound and light show at naginawadi is a must watch for those who are going there for the first time. Nothing extraordinary but explains about Ahmadabad through a dancing fountain show.They allow outside eatables and water as well. There are multiple free water coolers inside with dedicated food zones as well serving all kinds of delicacies. There are plenty of benches, lawns to sit and relax with cleaners constantly cleaning it up.In short, a perfect day for family outing. Easily accessible by BRTS, Auto rickshaw etc."

A Small refreshment trip for Ahmedabad,"Good and refreshing gateway for weekend for Ahmedabadis. If you have less time and looking for refreshment within city then this is very good option. Also many activities available for children , so good for family trip."
very good lake between city of ahmedabad,This lake is between city area of maninagar area in ahmedabad and many younger age children here to hanging and fun like place.
Kankaria lake review,This is a pleasant lake where people from nearby daily used to visit it. This is a nice place for the people who likes natural beauties.
Kankaria lake visit with family.,It's a huge lake. Kids friendly place. Adults will enjoy too. It's a huge lake and water body. Ideal time for visiting this place is between the months of October to February.
Best place to hang out.,"We had visited Kankaria lake with Family. Before some years it was very dirty and poorly maintained lake but after 2009 Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation made it like heaven. No vehicle zone. All pedestrian walkways are very well cleaned. Lake Water is also very clean. Children's play areas, food zone, Zoo, Balvatika (Fun Fair), Nagina Vadi (Island in the center of lake), Amusement park, Balloon ride, Boating, ATV ride, Bungy Jumping and the best are ATAL EXPRESS & SWARNIM EXPRESS toy trains which ride you around lake circumference. In evening there are very good eyecatching lightings arranged all around. You can enjoy the beauty of lake and so many birds by sitting on a side or indulge yourself in any of your favourite activity. Best for photoshoot too.Plus Public utilities at every few meters and also very well maintained... I love this place..."
A happening place to kill a half day,"the lake is nicely maintained.i visited along with my kids and they really liked it. zoo is good. one can see a lot of variety of animals.i specially recommend to visit reptile section. it consists of a lot of reptiles.the option for food is also there, though i donot recommend it."
A good place to have picnic,"This place is good for family picnic. They  have a lot of activities for children, such as train, zoo, outdoor activity, etc. A lot of sellers along the lake."
Lovely Place,"I visited this place lot of time when I was a kid. Now, when I visited Kankaria Lake with my family, its totally turnaround. It has become more beautiful than before. Lot of things to see here like, the Zoo, Balvatika, Nagina Vadi, Children Play Zone, Light and Sound Show. Must visit place for all."
"Casual place, good for kids.","Lots of activity for kids and eating options for everyone. Zoo is good, especially the nocturnal zoo offers a close look to animals like cheetah!"
Beautiful,Another spot in Ahmedabad must visit; huge periphery of lake and plenty of activities for people of all ages. Specially glittering at night!
Kankaria Visit after 10yrs,"Visited lake after 10yrs. Some good development on enclosing the lake with gates. More information and direction needed on the roads. Don't try food near gate no 3. Very high price, poor quality food. Can't imagine it's in Abad. Doesn't suit Abad for its foodie culture."
Came back again and again!,Loved the coolness of the lake with sooo much to do. There were lots of food retailers and boat rides and other activities.   Got on the train in my 2nd visit treated my friends for 30 rupees each that’s abt 30 cents Canadian. Had cooling Amul buttermilk - chaash in a Tetra Pak for 15 rs. Will come back for lights show next time. Lots of walking done each visit.
Good place for kids but zoo is not maintained well,"The place is located in old Ahmedabad & is good to spend some time with children in the evening.It also houses a big zoo inside it's premises. Although the lake area is clean n well maintained with a host of eateries along the line of the lake, the zoo is ill maintained."
Kankariya lake,What a redesign of lake by amcSuperb atmosphere here in early morning and late night also activities are superb need some improvements in food quality
enjoyed a lot,"a place where you can enjoy much more with family and kids. zoo, toy train, kids house, boating etc. are the major attraction for family and kids. The food quality at the various stalls are also good."
Nostalgia everytime I visit,"The place is just amazing. Whenever I visit it reminds me of my childhood days. It was the only attraction in those days which you would love to visit once every month.There is a train ride that will help you quickly take a rapid view of the entire lake at a very nominal rate.In the evening ,you can take a walk alongside the lake and enjoy the cool breeze plying around.There are several food stalls near the lake which helps you satisfy your hunger. Starting from munching's like bhel, corn, chana jor etc, you have a variety of food to have as the tummy fillers like pav bhaji and chinese. There is a Zoo near the lake, which I think is the only zoo in Ahmedabad. The zoo is big enough to help you spend 3-4 hours but its doesnt seem to have maintained that well.There is a section for kids as well, Don't remember the name, but it had many rides for infants, kids and adults too. It was fun being in their.Suggestion: Avoid touring the place during hoildays and weekends to enjoy the beauty. The lake is jam packed over the weekends."
Weekends with kids,Many activities for kids. Apart from mall you can bring your kids Kankaria lake for outdoor activities. There is entry fee for both.
good place to spend evening,a great place in the city to spend time with family n young children . there is a syncronised water fountain show and can do hot air balloon as well
Vacation ,"Great place to spend in evening with family. Games, boat ride, Air Ballon ride and many more activities for kids. Not to forget food joints in and around the lake complex."
Pride of Ahmedabad,"It is an most devloped lake in ahmedabad.Children park, rides, musical shower show, zoo park, boating, food stall all are included in this lake. Also mini train is available around the lake to see the lake and enjoy the train."
Decent but could be much better,It's a nice place for a walk and the mini train ride is fun. Good place to take the kids out thought it will be very crowded during the weekends and holidays. Wish there were better  food joints.

All day fun and more,"You can spend the whole day here with so many different things to do. mini zoo, aquarium, mini rail, an amazing zoo, boat rides, food, fun zone and joyrides. Good family destination when in Ahmedabad.Go ahead and enjoy."
Nice lake ,The lake every after being developed is a great place to visit. There are a lot of food stalls and boating is also possible..
Great view,Very great place and very good for the boat shikar and happy to visit there fresh air and great environment
Beautiful lake,"The lake is surrounded by parks, Baal Vatika, chindren's gardens, a boat club, natural history museum and a zoo. There are many sparrows flying at the evening time on upper of lake. There is toy train on this train you have to see the Lake on this train"
Calm place,I was visit here a long time ago. this is very calm and naturally beautiful place. everyone must go at once here
Must Visit,"It has lots of activities to offer. We had taken a ride in the speed boat, which charges Rs 130/person; short ride, but worthwhile. We had also been to the light and sound show, which charges Rs 20/person. It's quite beautiful and my kid enjoyed it. There are food stalls near the show, which offer items such as boiled corn, handva, khichu (served hot).There are many other activities catering to various age groups, including the mini train, aquarium, Kids City, Balvatika, slides, swings, etc. which the kids of all ages will definitely enjoy. There are also many restaurants, which serve a variety of food. We look forward to visiting Kankaria Lake every time we go to Ahmedabad."
Place of Ahmedabad,"Kankaria is one of the few places in Ahmedabad to enjoy a walk without the fear of being hit by a vehicle.In the evening it fills with crowd, food stalls and informal entertainment. There is also a water and light show. A zoo, a natural history museum, a toy train, a special garden for children called Bal Vatika, and an open air theatre are placed around the lake."
Nice place to Visit in evening time,"The place where you can get everything. Peace, Food, amusement park, activities for kids everything.. ITs really nice clean place.. where one can enjoy and spend Good times, this facility having naginawadi (short of Graden) in centre of the Pond/Lake."
Amazing place for family time,"We went there thinking to spend 2 hrs only but stayed there for half day, could have easily stayed there for full day but we had someplace else  planned to go. This place has train ride which covers the whole kankaria lake, speed boat, mini golf, archery and much more.  We had 3 year old child with us who loved the train ride and other activities. Due to lack of time, we could not cover all the places but all the activities and places we went were amazing. Must visit place if you are in Ahmedabad"
Perfect hanging out spot,"This is one of the cleanest and well maintained spots in Ahmedabad. It has something for everyone. It is scenic, offers you lot of food varieties, there are attractions for adventure lovers, a zoo and butterfly park for animal lovers, a botanical garden for nature lovers and a train ride as well as boating. Rating it 4 due to over-crowding of this place on sundays and weekends, however, it is still a must-visit."
Family place,This is a perfect picnic spot in Ahmedabad and Las lot of options to spend time if you are prepared to walk. This place has 7 enterance and has a toy train also .
Family time,Nice place with lot of activities and joy rides. Proper food courts are present. The toy train is a must do here. Very nice family outing place.
Must visit ,"Kankaria lake is a must visit place. It is huge.Kankaria Lake, formerly known as Hauj-e-Qutb, is the second largest lake in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It is located in the south-eastern part of the city, in the Maninagar area.  A lakefront is developed around it, which has many public attractions such as a zoo, toy train, butterfly garden, kids city, tethered balloon ride, water rides, water park, food stalls, and entertainment facilities. There is a week long festival held in December. Shore length is nearly 2 km. You can use free cycles available to explore this place. The lake front is lighted at night. There is laser show to be witnessed at night. There is train ride also on the lake front. A days time is also short to explore this place. You should definitely witness sunset here. You can click beautiful pictures here."
Should have brought some kids,"Looking back, this must have been the cleanest place I visited in my month in India. I really did not know what to expect before I went there, all the street vendors had told us to go there, all the architects said ""It's nothing"". So I had to find out ;-) It's closed off and there is a entrance fee, but not a big one. They have some rules about what to bring inside though. Inside It's a bit like an amusement park. There is the train that goes around the lake, an area with carousels, a butterfly garden, some plays, food courts, plenty of different things pops up every time you go around a bend, which is all the time, since it's round... I did not have a great time, and I would not tell my friends to go there if they did a similar trip, but that's because of me, not the park. I'm not the target for this place.If I had gone with a bunch of children I would have had an amazing time, so I will not give a bad rating. All the tings I looked at and thought, ""No, I've done that somewhere else..."" they would have wanted to do, and they would have loved it. With kids, this would have been a whole day of fun, with just a group of adults, a couple of hours I think. Don't go on your own. I did get nice pics though, so bring a camera."
Well maintained facility,Kankaria lake is very well maintained. It has become a tourist place with lots of eateries varying from Chinese to Indian cuisine to continental once.
Perfect spot to hang out on weekend,"Kankaria lake is well maintained by the administration.Lake has been developed as tourist spot with great places to eat out from Chinese to Indian cuisine to continental once.Lake contains various adventurous ride like rollar coasters,trains to take around the lake,tora Tora n various other rides ranging from adult rides to kids ride as well.Lake also offer rimpling activity to.All n all its a nice weekend destination were u can spend quality time ."
Great place for visit,"It is really great place for visit. You can walk ,Listen music ,nice atmosphere , best fun for children. Really best place for visit with no cost for your family."
Happening place,"This time I found the place totally reformed since my last visit in 1990. I learned that it was renewed in 2008. Earlier the place was used for spending leisure time and vehicles were allowed around the lake. However, this time I found that there is no entry for vehicles around lake. The entire area has been enclosed and access is given through 7 Gates. There is entry ticket of about 13 Rs for adults. Your beggage is cheked at entry point and the staff specially looks for gutka and supari pouches which are not allowed inside. The lake front has been covered with masonry and coloured  lights have been installed all around. The entire circumference of this lake which was  for long known as Hauz-e-Qutb, has been provided with entertainment facilities such as Zoo, nocturnal zoo, butterfly park, planetarium, aquarium, rides, theater, balvatika, amusement park (developed by Netherlands based company) tethered balloon, segway, water sports such as  zorbing ball, speedboat ride etc.There is an island in middle of lake which was known as Nagina baagh since it was like a studded jewel in raing shaped lake. These days the island is known as Naginawadi. The attractions are mainly concentrated on left half of entry Gate no. 1. The eye-catching attraction is a toy train which is closest to Gate-1. The train has 5 coaches each having about 10 rows for 3 persons each.It takes about 15 minutes to complete one round of aboout 2.3 km. The train was introduced on 25th Dec 2008 on birthday of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee (former Prime Minister) and has been named Atal Express in his honour. It has been manufactured by Severn Lamb, London. Toy train ticket costs Rs 30 for which you have to stand in queue. Tickets are given to one train load and as the quota is filled the ticketing is suspended temporarily till the train is about to arrive. By this time the ticketed lot waits on chairs in an enclosure. As soon as the train is in sight the ticketed lot is asked to queue up for boarding the train and ticket counter resumes issuing tickets to persons waiting for their turn.  There may be more activities that I have missed. To enjoy everything you need a full day or perhaps more than that. Last but not the least was sight of an elderly person who had come of his own and playing melodious old songs from hindi movies, mostly sad. He had no motive to earn anything from crowd and was distributing candies to children. We had no courage and time to know his story as we had a train for Somnath but I am sure he has a rather sad story to tell."
Kankaria shaan of ahmedabad,"No less then piers of UK or lighted display around niagara. I was delighted to see the richness and musical fountain, lights on Lake front, lights of a all rides and trains around the lake for children. Its well organised taking into account the population visiting it. Zoo was a great disappointment but lake is wonderful"
Thourough entertainment,"So, what is the right timing and right season to visit the lake? As for season, definitely the wintry months like Dec and Jan, But as regards timings opinions differ. The hotel owner and all the autowallahas were against an evening visit because of the over-crowded looks it wears in the evening. I was told I would have to wait at each and every point for 20 to 45 minutes for my turn. So we decided in favour of a  morning visit and entered the park at around 10 A.M. We don't still know what we missed but thoroughly enjoyed what was on offer.Certain rides would open only in the evening and may be we missed the evening glitter and razzmataaz also! But still made us believe that morning is the right time to visit the place. At least you are not pushed around and blissfully enjoy everything including the mini zoo which closes at 5 P.M."
Have a Walk or Jog Over there,"While in Ahmedabad , its quite worthwhile for nature lovers to spend an early morning at the Kankaria Lake have a walk or jog over there. The atmosphere there is serene , pleasant and less crowded as compared to the evenings when it is likely to become quite crowded. A place to refresh, relax and warm up !"
One day picnic place,"Kankariya lake was perfect place for one day picnic. I have spent full day here. perfect place for visit with family and kids. There were zoo, balvatika very near."
Cycling!,I love to do cycling here! Its a very cool place! The length to ride is long! You have the best atmosphere to be pumped!
A complete package for 1 day. Excellent place in Ahmedabad !!,"Lots of attractions to be visited like , beautiful lake , toy train riding , Zoo,Evening laser show etc. Laser show is must to watch. You will be amazed by birds flying here and there middle of lake. Zoo is not good enough to attract."
Worth visiting,"Good maintenance, nice upkeep, a lot of avenues specially for children. Merry go round train,temple, water body, boating, different children games, shows,cycling track, a lot of eateries..everything is here."
