Canton Tower,Too many people on holidays. Good to visit in evening or night to view canton tower in ligts. You can have a visit by tram on river side by 2 rmb. On river side there are many other places on river side. Each stop of tram has a specific visiting spot.
Colour and contrast,"Walking towards the river, the tower is unmistakable.  It is colourful at night, cutting into the night sky in a beautiful display of light.  It seems busy at night and gets busier as you get closer.  The vantage points of the tower are really quite good and well-designed.  Pictures don't always do it justice."
Quene & Quene but worth the time ,"Went to the xiao man yap, Canton Tower today . Checks were strict due to covid. Masks, temperature taking are a must. Tickets are personalized with name and passport number printed on the tickets. There's 3 rounds of ticket checking before reaching the tower. Everything was smooth and fast although there was some jostling and shoving during the quene for the lift. However this is typical of daily situation in China so behave accordingly to maintain your place in the quene. To get the best value for your tickets, go up around 6pm, hang around until 630 pm and join the quene for bubble tram to be on the tram just in time for sunset (sunset is now 705pm daily in summer but check the timing to be sure before you buy the tickets). With this timing, you get to see daylight, sunset and night time with 1 ticket price! I would also suggest reserving tickets 1 day in advance to avoid disappointment."
Most beautiful when lit up at night,"Beautiful from below, and wonderful views from the rotating observation deck of this 604-meter-tall tower and icon symbol of Guangzhou. Nice location beside the Pearl River."
Vacation ,Canton towers buzzes at night. There are crowded areas in the centre. Close by is a shopping mall and the subway station can be accessed easily.. This place is breathtaking and has many tourists looking for a place to catch the perfect photograph.
The only sunset view is recommended ,"I went to canton tower just once even though I live in Guangzhou and always have guests to bring there. It's a very crowded place and to be straight a bit overpriced. But still ”must-see” attraction in GZ, no doubt. We celebrated my wife's birthday on the top floor restaurant and I'd not recommend eating there even if you're very hungry. The food was looking nice but absolutely tasteless and in the end disgusting. Instead of doing anything inside or around canton tower, I'll recommend having dinner in Canton place or in any well-rated restaurant in GZ. Also for a better view its good to check the weather because if it's a bit crowded and you hardly see the building 1 km away means it's not the best day to go up to the tower. As an any big attraction in China, it's better to catch it during the sunset. You'll see how the city getting darker and puts the lights on and totally changes from its boring grey fog to the multicolor silhouettes."
Great view of the city,"Great view of the city, and went up at night after a conference held in Guangzhou. Easy to see the local sites of interest as they are marked and would recommend for a good view of this busy city at night,"
Modern architecture,One of the best places to visit in GZ. Love the surroundings the place is very organize and green. The tower itself is very unique with its design and stylish. I didn't go up to the top just took photos on the ground. Maybe the view during daytime is not as beautiful as during night time because of the position of the sun the photos taken were too bright. If I have another chance I would really want to go during night time.
Nice View of the City,This place is super nice on a Bright sunny day or at night. The view is probably the best in the city!
Stunning Views,The Canton Tower offers stunning views of the city. If you go in the evening on a clear day you can really see the city in all its might and glory.
Tall Tower with Great View of Guangzhou City,"The Guangzhou Canton Tower was at one time the tallest tower in the world - from August 2009 to March 2011.   This tower is unique in its ""twist"" shape design which is very distinctive and nice to look at.  The Tower interior is quite spacious, clean and modern - it is a very inviting place to visit.The view from the observation decks of Guangzhou city is nice - even though the view was somewhat ""foggy"" on the day that we had visited. Upon leaving the Canton Tower, everyone gets to go through the LG OLED Tunnel which is a state-of-the-art ""light show"" as you walk from one end of the tunnel to the other - very nice!   Overall, I feel that a visit to the Canton Tower is worthwhile and fun."
Stunning view,"Its the 3rd tallest free standing structure in the world.  Day view on top was stunning,  Night view from outside was beautiful.  There is only one small portion of glass bottom view.  Was expecting more glass bottom area.  Nevertheless, the view is still awesome."
"Marvellous view, except from the smog limiting it","The Canton Tower is quite remarkable! On the top, you can take the ""bubble tram"", and see the city below. When we visited, the smog limited the view quite a bit. Nonetheless, it is a breathtaking experience, and well worth a visit."
Colourful ,A bit bland during the day but very colourful at night when lit up amongst the rest of the surrounding buildings.
Bubble team and tower,We went there by day...no queuing at all. Great experience and bubble tram must do. Nice view and funny experience when in guangzou
Didn't make it up - too hard to buy tickets.,"We were already put off by the taxi trying to rip-off without using the meter, so not in the mood for further difficulties. I'll give you the tips anyway.  Best to visit on a clear night for the city light show. Main entry is at the West Entrance. Take your passport.  First go to a machine at back right, scan your passport and receive an ID ticket. If you need to enter details, hand-draw your letter on the left grey panel, press OK, then the right panel pops up with a range of English and Chinese characters. Tap on the letter to match and press OK. Then draw your next letter etc.  An ID ticket is issued.  Take to ticket office and buy a ticket, either the lower view, upper view or a combo with bubble wheel and/or zip line jump.  There is a discount concession ticket for seniors > 60 if you manage to explain.  Or buy online for a timed entry, but you still need to obtain the ID on arrival.  No English is spoken or displayed in the ticket office.  The Tourist Office next door may provide an officer to come and help you.  Shame we didn't have the patience to make it through, as I was looking forward to the view. Anyway we saw the lights walking around the river front and central park, which were really nice."
City Landmark,"Impossible to miss. If you are in Guangzhou, then you must be impressed by this beautiful tower. At night it is breathtaking."
Impressive Tower,"You should go there on a day, where is no pollution, in order to have a good view. The view to the town is great."
Canton Tower,"its a good place to visit, but remember its good in night only, so better plan to visit after evening, in dark you can see the beautiful color full lights, near to it you can go for fairy ride with dinner or snacks on that, you can go by Line 3 of subway (metro line), avoid on Chinese holidays and festivals times, because it will be so crowded and could take more then 1 hour to back to Subway station again, on the opposite side of river if you will walk for 5 minutes there are 7 eleven and some other store, where you can grab beer and can enjoy the evening."
Amazing views ,This is a great tower to visit with different levels We took the 450mts level with the balls tram and it was stunning . The tickets price for that level is around 30 € per person but it is really worth it .
Canton Tower,"It’s a tall building so be ready for hordes of people and expensive tickets. Overall, it is worth it. I went at night so it was fun to see the city lit up. That being said, you do miss other sights at night. The tickets are done in 3 hr blocks so be aware that you have to go up in your ticket window if you aren’t planning on heading up straight after purchasing them. There is also a deal on the tower+a river cruise, but I did not do that option."
Impressive,Beautiful sight at night with the changing colors. Amazing view from the top of the tower. The bubble tram on top of the tower is a must do as you will experience the best views of the city from there.
Looks beautiful in night.,"It's the 2nd largest tower in the world located on Canton metro station on line 3.Make sure you go in the night because it is illuminated with beautiful lights. There are many things which you can do but they are costly such as bubble tram (for 360 view of city), sky drop (100 foot free fall) etc.There is a mall below which is free to access.And make sure you see beautiful skyline from pearl river, its located near tower"
Great Views,The view of the city is amazing. Make sure to take a light jacket with you as it will be windy at the top. only one issue - the capsules obstruct the view of the city which means you must buy capsule for good view
Seen from across the river ...,"I did not actually go into or up the tower. But took pictures of it from across the Pearl River. At nights, it is garishly coloured, but yet, a captivating light show."
Mesmerizes in the night,Being third tallest tower it awes you as you stand beneath this majestic tower .Its more Beautiful in the night with all the light glittering all over .A must see if you happen to be in guangzhou.
A must see place of interest,"The world's third largest and China largest Tower, designed by Dutch architects. Went there with my grandson, little bit scary for him but later he told me it was super, take an outside gondola at the 111th floor, spectacular views over the city. Great fun to do."
Awesome Landmark In Canton!,This is an awesome landmark in Guangzhou. The light up at night was beautiful. The view at the observation deck was exhilarating and the are quite a number of nice restaurants at the lower deck!Awesome!!!
stunning views from the top,"Absolutely interesting to visit , best at night with the city lighted up. great experience. very fast elevator!"
Try the sky drop to remove stress!,"Wow! Amazing experience. If this is your first time in the city, you should go to the Canton Tower. Enjoy the 360 degree view of the city! If you’re not scared with thrilling rides, go and try the sky drop! It’s definitely worth it for me!"
Horrible experience,"Horrible place if you want to take nice pictures of GuangZhou.First of all, I came at about 4h00PM and it took me 30min of waiting to buy tickets, and 30min to take elevator.Then, when you finally reach the top, it was overcrowded, there was so much noice (chinese people speaking so loudly) that you can get a headache.In the end, all your pictures will look awfull because of tower's design. You can't take a nice picture without a pillar obstructing the view.It was a really waste of time, money and energy."
High tea time afternoon,We went for high tea at the Lucerne restaurant on the 105th floor. The view and experience were fabulous. We were able to go up to the observatory floors afterwards to see the sunset and city at night.
Night view,One of the best attraction in Guangzhou. Best time to visit during night time when it lit up with different type of lights.
Great views,Spectacular views of Guangzhou. Recommend visiting towards end of day so you can also see city lit up at night. Liked the “bubble ride on edge at top of tower.
Wish there was support for Foreigners,"I came from Toronto, Canada expecting to take the ride in the bubble carts + see the sights however, nobody was able to tell me that it was Out of service for a while and was scheduled to be available at 5pm. I learned about all of this at 12 noon."
Pretty at night,I did not climb it but was staying at the Park Hyatt hotel nearby and their rooftop terrace is the perfect place to see it well and take pictures at night when lights change all the time.
Nice but expensive ,"Because it is one of the highest platforms in the world we visited Guangzhou Tower.The views are incredible and the ride on the bubble tram is great.However you pay almost € 50,.. For entrance. Don't forget to bring your passport..."
Guangzhou must visit scenic spots,"I was in the WeChat small program Canton Laowai above see this scenic spot, Canton tower is very beautiful, the landscape is super good, up is need to buy tickets.This is a must visit place in guangzhou"
at night it is colorful,very colour place and big. it is nearby thr river. very beautiful place. recommend to come. it is the landmark.
Expensive but well worth it! ,We took the bubble combo around sunset and had amazing and clear views of the city. The bubble tram is also quite a lot of fun
Better at Night,"Canton Tower is the symbol of Guangzhou, you can enter and go up as the prices vary with each different levels from 50 yuan to 200 yuan I guess, You have a pretty decent view.At night its a good walk through the park and all the surrounding buildings and lightning gives it an effect, a picture moment."
Better to view it at distance at night,"We took the cab from Sofitel to this Guangzhou land mark; a engineering marvel to be admired. The lobby is full of shops and eateries; very tourist oriented. The price for the entry varies, depends on how high you wished to reach and you could enjoy amusement style ride on the very top. The area is nicely maintained and safe; I just enjoyed to view the spiral structure afar at night from the river cruise or from top of building to experience the true magnificent of this iconic structure."
"Amazing, especially at night","This place around Canton tower ia amazing. Big park, underground shopping mall, restaurants, walk by the river. Be sure to come during the night, while everything is shining."
Nighttime light show fabulous ,We went on our dinner cruise and enjoyed the views and lightshow including the Canton Tower. An extremely tall building in a city with thousands of multi-storey buildings stands over everything else. Well worth a visit to Guangzhou.
Amazing ,It’s iconic tower in Guangzhou downtown. See it from different views. I found best from Four seasons hotel’s 99th floor.Lighting is amazing. Worth the see
Very nice tower with light,I have chance to have a look at this tower when I was in night tour by ship and it was very beautiful with colors
The landmark of Guangzhou.,The Canton tower is the new landmark of Guangzhou.I came to Huacheng square twice to take pictures of the tower.The first time was at the 2200.The lights of the tower was fantastic.The second time was at 1400.The picture I took was more clear.I like to stay at the Huacheng square.That is the best place to view the Canton tower.You also can buy the ticket to reach the highest level to view the whole city.But the ticket is very expensive.
Its very nice when you see from the river or the bridge,You can see Canton tower from various places. I went to a river cruise and saw nice view from it. If not you can have good view from the bridge as well.
Amazing construction,We bought the whole package to go up to the highest level. The only thing we did not do was the sky drop. Do take the stairs up to the top balcony as we felt that was where you really experience how high you really are as it was an open & windy balcony.The bubble car was something different though it was quite smoggy when we were up and could not really see much of the city.
Unprofessional staff (Bar and restaurant),"This is hotel need to employ the professional and bilingual workersThe front desk is good but the normal services like bar, restaurant... nightmare,The worker can’t express themselves.That way they always upset because they can’t not speak other language apart from Chinese.I had arguments with Batman STEVEN regarding his manners. This can’t not be 5 star’s Hotel"
a must-see site in Guangzhou,"the canton tower is a must see in guangzhou. it changes color every few minutes, and it is really a site to behold. it is near Pearl River, another must see.  nearby are lines and lines of restaurants for every kind of canton dish and cuisine imaginable.  i'd recommend this to visitors of all ages."
Must do in GZ,"I’ve been in towers all over the world, however the picturesque scenery of the night lights revealing the modern center on Guangzhou admired under free sky at over 450m is breathtaking. You have a thrilling ride on top too, I suggest the full ticket price (398 yuans). Passport needed! I you visit during fairs you will receive a small discount when presenting the Canton Fair badge. Last entry @ 22:00, but if you want to take all rides on the top, you should be there latest 21:00.Enjoy!"
Amazing view of Guangzhou ,"Go straight and get 488M tickets to experience the best view. You will avoid all the crowd in any of the lower view deck. They only allow 40 people on the highest deck. If you can afford the price and have time, purchase all in 1 ticket, RMB398. Try to get a Chinese friend to purchase advance ticket online to avoid long queue and sold out timing. Do remember that online ticket require your full name according to your passport. And BRING your ID to enter. You can do the Ferries Car, Sky drop, access to all the deck. But do plan your time, each access is one time only. For example, we wanted to get pictures of the view during sunset and night view, we had to stay on the 488M deck the whole time. We couldn't do the ride and go back up. When we came back down, the queue for the Ferris wheel was too long. Too bad it was a bit hazy the few days we were in GZ. If not, it's so spectacular!Avoid any China holiday period! It was the National Day Holiday when we were there. We couldn't even get to the train station to get out of the island. Luckily we found out they provide shuttle buses at RMB5 to the nearest station!"
"Hope on, get some selfies",Visit there at 615pm. Find yourself taking lotsa of selfies as light interchanges.Then go over to Hua Cheng Da Dao to find some nice dinner.After which stroll around and find yourself taking more selfies from afar the tower.
"Nice visit any time, even in a cloudy day!","Place is amazing and the city has amazing architecture, not only the Canton Tower, yet it's the most iconic. Nice shot from the Four Seasons Guangzhou"
Not as great,"The ticket gets you up to the top floor where you walk around and have a 360 view but taking photos is not great as there is alot of reflection at night.  You go up, walk around and back down in 10 minutes, fun but disappointed that this was all to it"
China 12 hr transit visa,"If you’ve only got a few hours to kill and have a limited budget, the metro rail takes you right to most places for very cheap. The tower was one stop on our itinerary and gave us a nice layout and aerial pics of places we had already visited. Finished with a lunch downstairs at one of the many places available."
IMPRESSIVE!,"I started with a dinner, followed by a tour at the top, around 1/2 km above ground level. Very well organised; excellent elevators; stunning views."
Surreal view,The view at night is amazing! There are some “games” on top of the tower (if you are not to scared). Usually is gonna be full of people so choose a non-holliday day to go and try to be there for sunset 😉
Don't cheap out!,"I would usually never say this, but buy the most expensive ticket so you get out of the star observatory. I bought the 150 CNY ticket and the observatory was loud, the facade of the tower blocked your view and there was lots of glare on the glass at night. I paid 100 CNY to do the drop tower just so I could go to the deck and be outdoors, the view up there was better but the bubble tram blocked my view, but it was way better. The drop tower gave me the full unobstructed view, which I'll never forget. The drop was pretty standard, not worth it if you do it for the thrills, but now I get to brag I've been on the world's highest amusement ride. If I were to do it again, I'd pay for the 450 m lookout and go at daytime. The view at night was spectacular but since I don't know guangzhou well it was hard to be too engaged with it. Looking up at the tower from bellow was my favorite part of visiting, it's such a beautiful structure."
Would Recommend,"The Canton Tower is definitely a must when visiting Guangzhou, it’s an amazing landmark with great views.  Access was easy and elevator ride to top was fun. The surrounding plaza can be very congested and is safe for travelers, but I would suggest you watch your belongings. Canton Tower is a ""must see"" building when visit to Guangzhou and we took Pearl River Cruise which permitted us to see the Canton Tower lit up in a multicolored display. Would recommend a visit."
Gorgeous sight to behold,"You do not have to be at the Canton tower itself to see it, best viewed from a distance away by staying at a hotel near Zhujiang (Pearl River). The colourful rainbow lighting from this tower is certainly a sight to behold and the ever changing patterns are amazing and breathtaking, it’s able to display wordings as well. It is an iconic structure that represents the vibrancy and beauty of Guangzhou. It is a must visit place. Will certainly be back. Lights out at 11pm every night and greets you good night too!"
Awesome Place,"The Canton Tower is truly iconic and majestic. It is definitely worth a visit at night to watch the light show, its truly an awesome experience."
Main Attraction,"Came here as it was one of the main attractions in Guangzhou.  Even though you have an unrivaled view of Guangzhou, when you are inside the tower it feels like they are trying to hard.  I felt for what you pay as an entrance fee was not worth it.  There are a variety of tickets you can buy, each of them including a higher floor or additional experience, such as the thrill ride or the bubble tram.The one big positive for me was the open air viewing platform.  For me that was the main selling point."
KKChan,Seems to be one of the newest landmarks in Guangzhou. Beautiful place especially when all lighted up by night.
I am afraid there is no choice but to get on a bubble tram.,My only suggestion for Trip Advisor users is to purchase the bubble tram ticket even if it is expensive. This is the only way to enjoy the view from the top. The view from the observatory deck is really poor due to the external structure of the tower that limits what you can see. Needless of me to say that taking the bubble tram at sunset time is the best option.
Vastly overpriced ,We have been travelling in China for nearly two months now.This 'attraction' must take the prize for the worst price/value ratio of anything we have seen.It's just too darn expensive for what it's offering.
"Spectacular views, but not really worth the price","The views are great, but the entrance fee is crazy even by Chinese standards. Go there only if you have a huge amount of money and no idea how to spend it"
Fascinating view!,"Fascinating view all around Guangzhou, Bubble Tram up there proved to be big adventure. Smooth ride up and down."
Bubble Tram,The bubble tram at the top of canton tower was a slightly expensive but fun stop for us during our layover in Guangzhou. You get excellent views of the city for photos and the tram is a fun and unique experience.
Must see with its lovely coloured lights at night.,"We were in Guangzhou for 24 hours and the 24 hours subway pass at 20 yuan is extremely handy and value for money.  We bought it from the service counter at the subway station in Guangzhou South railway station on arrival.  We stayed at One and One International Apartment which is linked to People Park station.  This station has two very useful lines, 1 and 2(to airport).In the evening, we took the subway to Canton Tower followed by the APM to Guangzhou Opera House.  We could see the beautiful lighted Canton Tower across the Pearl River.  Again we boarded the APM and it travelled across the Pearl River to Canton Tower.  From Canton Tower, we walked along the promenade along the Pearl River.The next morning, we came here again to take the Guangzhou Tram which starts at Canton Tower.  It passes through many scenic spots including the different bridges across the Pearl River, the Canton Fair ground and a lovely park in the suburb with a tall pagoda.  We rode it to the terminal station.Canton Tower at night is a sight not to be missed with a walk along the Pearl River."
Love it!,I've been there twice and I can see the tower from home. View of the whole city can be seen on the tower.
Grand,Architectural marvel very nice amazing built. A soothing site from any visible angle. The light effects at nite is even better. To seen it up close and from a distance is a wonderful thing
Wow One of the Best Architecture,It is really very good to see the Architectural view of this Tower. I will suggest everyone to go there and see the Beauty
Nice,"Especially nice at night with the lights on. Symbol of the city, I really like its peculiar shape, recognizable even from big distance."
A site to see at night,The area is booming with life at night. Beautiful pictures can be taken by the river. The lights make it a spectacle to see.
Superb and breathtaking view & sky drop,Too good place to see with world record of skydrop at this much high tower Tickets are bit costly But skdrop is must so forget costBreathtaking view of city Must see place Very good location good connectivity with metro buses and road
Nighttime views best,"Similar to many towers like this, nighttime views from the observation deck are best. At night the city is lit up, and some buildings are ever changing in colors. Also, the tower itself is the most beautiful of the nighttime colored structures."
Fun Travel,I loved the commanding views. I enjoy being downtown. It realky is a place to get lost and eat some great food and an exceptional environment!
Must visit in Guangzhow - 488m high highest tower in Asia,"A must visit, Cloud observation deck, Buffet restaurant, sky bar, Bubble tram, mesmerized with the arrangement. Only they accept Alipay, Wechat and Yuan. They dont outside accept cards.. pl carry cash. Even the photo shops gives u photos on wechat, they dont use google/ email etc etc.. whatsap is also not working there.. Excellent experience.. lift speed is 10m/ sec.. so the entire journey took less than a min."
the symbol of Canton,"Is the symbol of Canton (Guangzhou)! Beautiful and lighting in any circumstance.From the big square, visibile everywehere and from where see Canton is simply an experience!"
great way to get high,"I came pretty late (2130) with last entry being at 2200 and the tower shutting down (officially) at 2230. I got the ''most popular ticket'' for ~228Yuan, whilst it does say ''bubble capsule'' on the ticket it seems that this is an extra 180Yuan once you get up so the only adventure ride they let you on is the drop.Regardless of this is a well-organised tower, however, the interor lights on the lower viewing floor make taking photos difficult (not impossible) so I would HIGHLY suggest the top viewing area (sans-windows) where you can get great photos and get a slightly better view."
Awakening,"This place is good to visit since you'll get to see the area in 360deg view. And if you love some adrenalin rush you can try the rides on top. LG technology display is included inside. It's my first time in Guangzhou and this place made me realize how China made it big on trades (nice transportation land or water, no traffic, very clean and organized)."
Canton Tower ,"Need booking online for bubble tram, sky drop and after for boat. Now in China for each hot spot, better booking b4, some time 3 days .. Forbidden City"
Big Ediface,The Tower can be seen throughout Guangzhou.  It is a very poplar site for visitors.  You can purchase tickets on line.  Lines are very long especially at night to see Guangzhou's night lights.  I wen in the day time and lines were very short.  You need your passport for ticket purchase.  I went to observation deck at 422 meters. Great view and photo ops!!
Amazing!,"I visited the tower and it was amazing, If you do not visit the tower do not go to Guangzhou. Nuff said"
Magnificent,"At night, singing fontain, many many people. Whole squere is wondeffull and worth to visit. You will spend one-one and a half hour easy there."
Attractive But Pricey and Messy,"Canton tower is a good landmark to visit while at Guangzhou. However going up is pricey and messy, with very long queue. There are some restaurants, very expensive, but food quality is just so-so. The restaurants also closed very early at around 9.30pm. We were dining at 110th floor (408 meters above ground).The lookout floor doesn't really give a clear view of Guangzhou. The glass window was dirty, very difficult to make good photo of Guangzhou from above."
Taking A Break,Nice place to go at night but be aware that there’s always been crowded specially weekends. Really beautiful night view..
Wonderful view ,"We did the bubble tram ride and definitely worth the money. View is amazing (surprise, surprise). Crowd was a bit daunting and online booking required a wechat account."
Must go place in Guangzhou,"It’s a mesmerizing place. Colorful light beams, colorful sky, music., basically it’s a happening place in the night. At around 8 -9 pm water fountains with colorful lights and music starts in canton squire. You can sit on Pear river bank and enjoy the sight of mighty Canton tower in the background all night if you wish wondering magnificent modern architecture of it."
nice view,"Went there by subway, getting off at the Chigang Pagoda station. Had a late dim-sum lunch at ""Chopstix""restaurant in the basement which was almost deserted at that time. Then we purchased rmb150 Zone E tickets to get to the highest viewing floors. Hardly any queue when we were there, so it was easy and fast getting the lift up.There were 2 floors to explore but you needed to pay more to go up to the roof for the ""bubble car"" ride. Would highly recommend going in the evening to enjoy both daytime and night-time views of the city. The city lights and boats cruising on the Pearl River were beautiful."
This will keep me quiet while I look at the Canton Tower,Being in the dentist's chair kept me very quiet while I looked at Guangzhou's iconic Canton Tower. This time I got to see it from a different height and perspective. The most marvelous time to view it is at night when it is beautifully lit up.
Best Nigh View,Go there in night to see beauty of lights and feel cool breeze on edge of pearl river also enjoy walk in same environment
go there when the sky is clear,if you have plan to go Canton tower it is very important to make sure sky clear in good weather. because most of the days in guangzhou is foggy and rainy . to get to Canton tower don't miss to take AMP line to get there because the train pass river side and it is very beautiful .dear reader i hope this review is helpful for you . i lived in guangzhou for 2 years .if you have any questions please feel free to message me .
Beautiful Creation Of Modern Architecture ,Beautiful piece of architecture! Amazing work done by Chinese engineers. At night lighting is beautiful and truly colorful. Underground couple of places are available to eat including a Starbucks. Must visit place in Guangzhou!
Another tower and Ok,It was a bit long winded to get a ticket after entry.Staff were so soLift was ok but not as good as some towersOnly went to first level but really good views Glad I visited.Best view is in the evening from the outside rather than going up.
Great view!,"Awesome place to take your family to visit if they are not afraid of the heights, especially the Ferris-Wheel, its the highest in the world and provides extraordinarily view of Guangzhou from the tower."
Very expensive and most of the time inside of clouds.,Entrence fee is very high. Most of the time during my trip inside of clouds. Enterence is very poor. Find something more interesting instead of to visit tower if it is rainy.
Amazing ,It’s an amazing tower. Looks wonderful in night with Color changing lights. Beautifully decorated.Must watch
Magnificent,One things Chinese know is how to make great structures of architectureLying on the bank of the river one can get spectacular views of the Guangzhou skyline
Beautiful massive structure,Offers beautiful view of the city. Amazing to see the tower when lights are on. Has an amazing display electronics
Not just another tower!,Go on the bubble rail car ride!! It adds something extra to the more usual glass floors and fast lift experience you find elsewhere. And the views are wonderful
Amazing view,"Visited with relatives, place is within walking distance from Huacheng Square, the view from the top was really impressive, make sure you pick a day with a nice weather otherwise the fog and pollution will definitely disappoint and spoil the view.What I really didn't like was the whole process of getting a ticket and having to go to a separate booth to register your details having to wait in the queue for a long time, they should review the process and make the whole experience much easier for tourists.Pick the right day weather wise and the right time to avoid the crowds!"
Average experience. Make sure to bring your passport!,"Really important point to note; Bring your passport! When purchasing tickets you must produce ID and input your passport number into a machine, along with it taking your picture. Only when you do this can you purchase tickets to go up the tower.This was a huge surprise as it's not advertised and it caught out several tourists whilst we were there.Security into the tower is tight! I'm talking tighter than going up The Empire State Building. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty busy. The queue up for the lift is a bit lengthy. At the top of the tower theres lots of room to walk around and view the city.Unfortunately Guangzhou is extremely cloudy/foggy. This can result in zero visibility at the top.It's not cold on the upper levels which makes it pleasant. We also tried the bubble cars at the top. These are small glass cars which slowly revolve around the top of the tower for 1 lap. It's not really worth it as you see nothing extra by doing this.Overall it's an average tourist experience. It's not a ""must do"", in my opinion."
Astonish view,"Very nice view from top,  perhaps a little bit expensive, but if you are there you should not miss it"
Just Beautiful and well organized!,"If you plan to go to Guangzhou, you must visit the Canton fair. I had a great time there with my friends!"
Center of the skyline,"Cool views from the top. It is the central part of the GZ skyline though, so probably better to go up another building. IFC has a restaurant on the 82nd floor for example. From there you get views of the skyline and of the tower. Or even the views of the tower from the New Town park are good."
Fabulous views,"We went up the tower for dinner. The food was ok for a buffet- good variety. I had lobster which was dry and lastless so that was disappointing. Plenty of food. The view was fabulous! Worth going up to see.After dinner we went to the observation decks which were really busy. It took over 30 minutes in a que to get in the lift to come down.Thought it was expensive for the meal, but it was worth it for the view.You should book if you want to eat in the tower."
Canton Tower,Great views from here Don’t forget your passport though or you won’t be going up! Well organised to get in and clear routes around the tower We didn’t go on the bubble ride but looked exciting !
Awesome night time experience,"Definitely worth a visit, especially at night when it lights up beautifully and there are all the other lights of the city to enjoy from the river bank.You can go to the top of the tower, get your ticket online before you go. Easily accessed using the subway or the tram which runs from Canton Tower to Wanshenwei."
"""First"" skyscraper in Guangzhou","Canton Tower marks Guangzhou's golden age in urban construction. Occupying the south bank of Pearl River, it forms the city's ultra-modern skyline. Worth a look."
The best view in Guangzhou,"The best view in Guangzhou is from the top of the Canton Tower. If there is only one place to go, this has to be at the top of the list.  At the top of the tower there are two levels inside at the top and then one level at the very top. The two inside levels are very spacious and comfortable and I enjoyed the amenities, comfortable places to sit, small glass floor areas for the brave people like standing in the air, and the shops for gifts and snacks. I really enjoyed the 'Skytram' at the very top, comfortable protected tram so you can sit and travel around the very top and see every different direction. Definitely worth a wait if there is one. It was very nice to go late in the afternoon and I was able to see things when the sun was out, but also catch the sunset and linger a little longer to enjoy the lights at night in the city."
Beautiful tower. ,"Completely different than CNtower or any other towers. In evening colourful light work what they have done is amazing. I Didn't went in to the tower, I was in the boat ride in the river and saw it for an hour. One must do their river boat ride as well."
Beautifully lit up,We did not go in...but the view when its lit up at night is quiet a sight! Will go in next time around!
Good experience.,"We enjoy going up high for a look at cities we visit. Canton Tower isn't a low price, but still affordable enough. We got there around 5, and went straight up. It was a great view, especially as the weather was clear enough. Had our photo taken on the glass floor part, but didn't buy one as it cost almost the same as entry! After about an hour we went back down, had something to eat, and then it was dark, so we saw the Tower all lit up. Beautiful! Some building along the Huangpu River are also lit, and the river boats too, so it's a mini version of The Bund in Shanghai. Well worth the visit."
"Great building, but do not go up.","Is very expensive to go up, you better enjoy it from below unless you really want to have dinner there."
sightseeing,One of the venue u need to visit when u are in gz. visit the tower at 4pm spend two hours to tour the amaing sight of the whole guanghou. if u like a little of fun go to the top of the tower n have a cable car ride.Service staff friendly n also there to seek assistance. u can have a drink n buy some sovenior in the lobby. Booked a pearl harbour tour from the tower n enjoy the lighting of the building around the river. i will be back as no time to dine in the restaurant. Thank u cantontower.
Charming,The tower is beautifully lit in the dark in the evening. Take a boat trip down the river around the tower. It's a wonderful experience.
One of the best places in guangzhou ,The canton tower is one of the best places that the guangzhou visitors needs to visit The prices will start from 150 yuan
Breathtaking,"Amazing building. From outside, as inside. The full ticket worth all the money. The view from top to see all gz and the Pearl river, on clear skies is awsome. Plus the free fall ride, included in the ticket is the tallest in the world, so things to tell home :)"
Nice view,"I don’t have much to say about the Canton Tower. I didn’t visit it from the inside because I find these towers to be the same, so after visiting a few, you no longer have interest in doing so anymore. But it’s a nice view from the outside, and good to take a couple photos too if you want a memorable photo from Guangzhou."
Nice view,The highest tower in Guangzhou . Nice place to see the city from the sky. Unfortunately we have been there in a cloudy day so we couldn’t see everything we hoped. We will come back in October!
Best time is at night time,"The lights come on just after dusk. There is a tram to the bottom of the tower, ideal for selfies. But a night river cruise is a better way to see the Tower change colours"
Breathtaking Views,"Well if you are in Guangzhou then you must check out the iconic Canton Tower. Best to visit when the skies are clear to see the gorgeous views of the city. My favourite time to visit is during the evening, so when the lights get on, it looks fantastic."
Fabulous tower,State of the art Tower. Great view from the top even though it was overcast. Loved the cable car ride on the 107th floor. Well organized and friendly service.
Must visit in Guangzhou,This is a must visit place in Guangzhou. Go in the evening to enjoy the lighting show.Please avoid going on public holidays.
Amazing View,Amazing view of the Canton tower from the opposite via the APM line. Its was very crowded the time I visited as it was the QingMing holidays. However do spend a few hours roaming around admiring the magnificent view of the world number 3 tallest tower.
Beautiful night view,"A popular attraction. Crowded is expected. We did not going up to the observation deck, we just enjoyed the colorful lighting decoration of the tower. A good photo spot.Visited on June 2018."
Long queue but overall is a good experience,Travel with a baby to the Canton Tower.  The bubble tram offer a very nice 360 degrees sight of Guangzhou!
Lightshow is amazing.,"Good lightshow, especially at night! Pearl River is nearby and a lot of restaurants are nearby. Perfect for tourists :-)"
Good visit,"Jogged to the Tower from Ramada Pearl, about 1km away. Good eateries and some shopping around. if you want to, go up the observation deck for a bit to take a look at the city from a high. some tight security so just be mindful."
Crowded but Fun,Amazing place specially in the night with colourful atmosphere lights around the canton tower!!  Peaceful atmosphere delicious food around
Amazing views if sky is clear,We visited the Canton Tower last night and were blessed with clear skies. The view was spectacular. You can buy several packages to experience Canton Tower. The basic viewing costs ¥150 but you won’t get the great outdoor view. We chose the second best package for ¥298 which included the bubble tram. It was epic! Another option would have been to go on the sky drop but we are glad we didn’t do it as it’s only a few seconds long.Pricing options are attached in the photos...enjoy!
An amazing experience,Visit The tower was an amazing experience in the night. The view was terrific. Bubble tram was nice.
Really cool but a shame some of the views were blocked,"Unfortunately the balls around the edge of the upper floor of the tower were not working and where they are placed definitely impacts your ability to view.Going up in the lift is really awesome, seeing yourself go higher is very scary but awesome.Still even with the above said the views are awesome and the record drop on the top is great.Definitely worth a visit. Make sure to take your passport."
Beautiful sight!,We stayed close to the tower and it is such a sight in the night. Its iconic and you can't miss it. It is one of the remarkable highlights about Guangzhou.
Site sewing ,Great way to see Guangzhou. Recommend the ride on the roof . Easy to get to and very well organised. Highly recommended.Haysam
Sparkling tower,"I saw the beautiful and glittering Guangzhou Tower both in the park outside and the Ascott ifc Guangzhou apartment where I live.  I saw it very spectacular and it also emits colored lights. It is very attractive. It’s a great place to go to watch the tower, especially at night"
Don't go on Rainy day,"Getting to Canton Tower is a hassle if you intend to take APM train. It's always jam packed. We gave up after seeing 4 sardine packed trains one after another. Buying tickets is not foreigner friendly cos passport's not acceptable. You need to generate a foreigner ID in another machine at West sales booth. Views at 108 storey was no big deal, unlike IFC, Shanghai which shows 360 views of great buildings. Pearl River view ain't great plus obstruction by the many V shape supporting columns, makes a great photo challenging. IFC got a plus of looking down which the taller Canton Tower does not have. Another disappointment like Pearl River Cruise."
"Awesome view, abusive tickets","The view is just awesome, however the ticket prices are just absurd. 150yuan for the lowest floor, and DOUBLE the price for the bubble tram and skydive.We are unlucky and picked a cloudy day so the view wasn't that especial, but still was nice.Also, the photos they take while you are there are charged highly (120 yuan for a single one).The LG LED tunnel was even better than the tower itself lol."
Highlight of Guangzhou,The Canton Tower was the absolute highlight of Guangzhou. It's a beautiful building and the colourful lighting at night makes it very nice to watch. I could literally stand there for 30 and just watch it cycle through different colours.Take a stroll alongside the river and enjoy this magnificent piece of modern architecture.
Beautiful place ,"I like Guangzhou, this is city of new technologies and nice people , TV tower nice place , but in Guangzhou all places very nice. I can talk for hours about the charms of this city, but I will tell you the main thing. People are very kind and helpful. I like that they all play sports. Every day on the waterfront dance, run. The Chinese are very simple people, do not forget that every second millionaire and he will come to you without any problems and ask you to take a picture with you) I advise everyone to read Guangzhou"
Canton Tower,"I was told that to go go the top of Canton Tower you have to pay. So I decided to enjoy it from the other side of the Pearl River. By day it just looks like an hour glass. By night it comes alive, glowing with different colours, sometimes just one colour, but also with two. I viewed it from the ground and also from the top of the IFC Tower, which is on the opposite bank of the river, and you can go to the top for free."
Visit ,We visit the canton tower with family. Wow too any people..The view is great and the building is very tall.
Stupid way to spend ur money,"Spent 2 hours in line just for nothing, take a pics and have to pay huge amount of money. This is a robbery. Not recommended at all. U wasting time n money, better plan a romantic dinner in fancy restaurant. Staffs are confusing, nothing good to say. First time visiting and not ever want to come back 👋🏻"
Most Famous Landmark!,"The Canton Tower is the most famous landmark in Guangzhou.If you visit Guangzhou, then you must definitely experience the Canton Tower.You can go either during the day or evening. However, the evening is more interesting with a popular light show and a lot of activities happening around the tower complex.Guangzhou people are very proud of the tower and will ask if you have had the opportunity to see it."
360 view ,Canton Tower is one the iconic tower in Guangzhou and I love the 360 ride on the top and you can see the hole city. I suggest night time
Nice place to visit in the evening ,I have visited many towers in China but this place is little different.  The toy train running nearby along the riverside is added fun. You can access to  many places nearby. From the top of this tower you can see all guangzhou if the weather is clear.
Guangzhou’s iconic rainbow-of-colours tower,"The footsteps/ground-area of the 595.7-metre Canton Tower (Chinese name: 广州塔), is home to at least part of most major celebrations in the city. It is a common gathering place for celebrations. I’ve enjoyed going up in the transparent-walled elevator to the 108th floor. On most days, from the observation platform you’ll get great views of the city and the river which flows through it. The Chinese seem to like glass-bottomed floors, as they seem to be on many high observation platforms and glass-floored pedestrian bridges. The local area is also an excellent place for evening and early night walks, when it is often crowded with locals and tourists. For going up the tower, I’d tend to avoid weekends and holidays, when the queues can be over an hour long."
an iconic landmark,"You didn’t visit Guangzhou if you didn’t at least walk around Canton Tower. There is an admission cost, and packages with prices that rise with each height level. There’s much to do within the tower itself: a bubble ride at the top, TV & radio transmission things, various observatory decks, gardens, revolving & non-revolving restaurants, shops, and a cinema. There are two types of elevators that take you to the top: slow pano & fast double-decked. The underground area contains the bus and metro access points and a parking area, as well as  exhibition/commercial halls, more shops, and a food court.It’s worth seeing day or night... just make sure you avoid those that are heavily polluted (otherwise all you’ll see is nasty smog, and it won’t be worth the time or money spent). I personally prefer ogling the views at night with everything aglow with colorful lights! Try and catch the light festival when it occurs, as well!"
Nice Views In Spite of Haze,"The day was hazy, but there were still incredible views to be seen. I went during the day so I could see out. The observations deck are on the 107th and 108th floors with very high speed elevators to take you up there. The 109th and 110th floors have a ""Science and Technology Discovery Centre"" that was not well visited. It did show some intersting features about the tower and how it is designed to behave during an earthquake and during a typhoon (hurricane). Overall, a good place to see Guangzhou from the sky."
Great Place with rides at top ,"I would come here again. Beautiful views. If you go purchase the tickets with the three “rides”. Two are seats you sit in and get dropped, and one is the globe that goes around the tower."
Iconic Tower,This  tower is an icon of China. I like the design of this tower. It is directly connected to subway. I missed the nightview. Canton Tower Scenic Spot is awesome.
The highest tv tower in China ,"Recommended!See the video about the elevator in my ig: so fast!Metro station to arrive, shops and Starbucks closed to the entrance, the view is stunning!"
Interesting to visit,There are lookouts but also many shops and cinema in the Tower. The Metro is also here allowing visits to many other sites
Gorgeous at night!,Not to be missed. There is so much to do around and within the vicinity. My only beef is that they keep posting outside the ticket booth the Observatory/Day Cruise at Y170 but in reality totally unavailable. We even went back twice but to no avail. I think they put it there to deliberately piss you off.
Nice view can touch the Sky ,"Love the view at night time , we really recommend to everyone here . A bit expensive 290¥ Chinese currency .  Must calm for making a role following the line as more local Chinese people there.  Waiting more than an hour a line. Love this place ."
A must seen landmark !!,Simply it is the city icon. Easily accessible by metro. Tickets prices are varying depending on which activities you want. The staff took photos for everyone and if you want the photo you will have to buy it at the 108th floor. The view is incredible. The elevators are fast and safe. Really it is an experience that must be tried
Daytime visit - great views thru the smog,"About 15-18 tourists are crammed into a small elevator for the quick ride to 5he top. There is not much to do at the top - great 360 views but when we went during the day, visibility was poor. There is a glass bottom platform where you can look straight down that is good for photos - there are assistants who will take a nice overhead photo which you can purchase, or they are also happy to take a photo using your phone. I would only return if I were here at night. We went on a slow day so there was not much of a wait but I would be really disappointed if I waited in line for a long time to do this."
The landmark for Guangzhou,"The tower is the centerpiece for all things Guangzhou! At night, with the ever changing lights, this is a gorgeous scene and the star if many tourists’ scrapbook! I wouldn’t recommend paying the exorbitant fee to go up - you can get an equally good (if not better) from many of the high level  hotel bars and restaurants in the area."
Spectacular view,You get a great 360 degree view of the whole city.  Definitely a must see attraction when visiting Guangzhou.
endless beauty,"very beautiful view! This tower is colorful and very high, from there you can admire the wonderful city of Guangzhou!"
Good,"Canton Tower is on the Iconic establishment in Guangzhou. At night more beautiful when different color Light shows from Tower.best view we found from Pearl River Cruise,  Boat cross the Tower that was Amazing view. like that"
Value for money.. very good,I liked the Pearl tower in Shanghai and this the most attractive.. bhur khalifa is has too much formality at the ground level.. WTC at New York is also the best
Amazing birdview 600M height tower in Guangzhou,"When I reached there almost sunset time, I found one open air platform at 450M, very good for photographying, and also with Ferris Wheel, the highest one in the world. When I tried to reach platform 488M for morephotsgraphing, I was informed the ticket I purchased not included that platform sightseeing. So if you like go platform 488M, you need buy the relative ticket. It is a little bit pity that day the air is foggy, not good for clear birdview photos, so I just have some photos at the stairs with ferris wheel, and even some wedding photos.The total height is 600M, easy to arrive by subway line 3."
Above the City,"To see the whole city, this is the place to go.  Third highest tower in the world, the Canton tower marks the center of the city. Surrounded by parks and walkways, it is a very nice spot."
Late evening walk on riverfront,The tower looked amazing with changing colours at night. We also had a chance to see the light show which happened at around 8pm. The weather was pleasant for the walk and then we moved to party pier for late night.
Bubble tram,"We arrived at 7:30 pm with it light enough to see daylight views although very smoggy. We travelled on the bubble tram which was a little scary boarding with the children as the bubbles continuously move slowly and there is the feeling of being so high above the ground. Up to 6 people can ride on each tram which was perfect for our family of 6.Our visit took just under 2 hours in total to ride the tram, admire the view from the inside observation deck with the city lights turning on, purchase a photo (only prints in frame, no digital options) and head back down. The changing vibrant colours on the tower against the dark night sky are beautiful."
The Landmark of Guangzhou,"The 600 meter high tower that is really beautiful, especially in the evening when it’s litup in different colors."
vere interesting,"It is very interesting to visit. The outside is wonderfull, but going up to have a fantastic view of the city"
Very well prepared tower,We visited this plas acctually just to get photo with this iconic spot of Guangzhou.  The place itself is very large lobby with many shops and cafe. The ticket to go up a bit high. But if you want to take photo with the full tower scene... you must take trai to oher side
Breathtaking by night,"Near the Zhujiang River, the Canton Tower is best to visit just before dusk to watch the Tower and surrounding buildings transform into a theatre of lights.  Super crowded though but probably because of NYE.  The queue to get into and out of the metro was insane!  Fortunately it was ponly two metro stops away from our hotel (Sheraton) so we walked it.  The view of the Tower looks better on the bridge.  You can easily get onto the overpass bridge and cross either side of the river.  There is a City Garden Park on the opposite side to the Tower which is also very nice by night.  To get to the Canton Tower take Metro line 3 to Canton Tower exit A."
Expnsive,"We bought a combo Tower + night cruise.Tower tour is nice, night cruise is just ok.Don""t forget your passport, or they won""t let you in."
Must see in China 🇨🇳 ,"Breathtaking view of this 600m tower, the lights change adding to the glamour. Has eating places below and prices for viewing range from 150 yuan ( per Adult) to 398 yuan depending on activities you pursue on the top of the Tower. Please take note ... no tickets without passports so carry your passports. I enjoyed the views from the outside and this is totally free .... have a wide angle lens ... or go pro with a selfie stick to get whole tower in the frame A must see and also 5 minute walk to Pearl river"
Superb way to see Guangzhou from a height of 488 Metres or more,We had planned to go here to see the sunset and enjoy the night view. We were slightly delayed but enjoyed the night view from the observation deck at 488 Metres.The view from the top of the newly emerging skyline of Guangzhou and the Pearl River including many strategic parts of the city is stunning. The bubble tram at the observation deck offers a 360degrees view of the city. It moves round the tower at its edge (has cabins like the London Eye with 6 passengers being allowed per cabin) and has been built with impressive technology. The architecture of the tower is impressive too.The photos taken by the Tower staff offer a good memory if taken well. We bought three photos which came with one free frame. Photos were of reasonably good quality. Three photos cost 200 Yen.The OLED Tunnel was a nice way to the exit where the impressive impact of self-emissive display technology is showcased. One clip in the tunnel shows the Guangzhou skyline which is nice to see.The authorities need to correct the caution display at the observation deck where blood pressure is spelt as bold pressure.Enjoyed the visit. Good and relaxed evening in Guangzhou.Munir D.
Great Views at Night,One of the best places to spend your night and evening . Beautiful lights but the price is too high to enter inside the building
Must see attraction in Guangzhou ,A beautiful tower with a wide array of colors in the evening. A Must see attraction in Guangzhou. The view on the top of the tower is amazing. You can view it indoors or go to the top which is outdoor. Day and night view has its own charm.
"Canton Tower, my fav view in Guangzhou","I visited on a Saturday.  Long line, but easy to get a ticket once you navigate the line.  I got the 288 yuan deal.  Two floors and a look out (and bubble tram).  Fantastic view.  Best part was leaving the tower as it lit up for the evening.  Great photos!"
Amazing ,Ok be of the tallest structures in Guangzhou.... bru impressed with three architecture and engineering in designing this tower....A worthwhile busy for sure....
Impressive ,"It’s a Beautiful Tower and very impressive. We enjoyed our visit and love the view from above. It was said that Canton Tower is the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in the world by pinnacle height (604 m). We took a subway as it is the most easy way to get there. Subway line 3 to the station of Chigang Pagoda, take exit B. It was open daily until 20pm. We went up to the observation deck and it was 433.2m high. It was beautiful up there especially at night where we could see the beautiful colourful city lights. Before entering the tower we were just walked around and it was nice to explore it’s surroundings."
Must visit in the city. ,"Awesome building to see when you visit the city. Really nice and wourth the ride. We also did the hop on, hop off bus. Only 4 dollars and you see a lot of the city."
"Don't Miss, Must Visit","Please take your time and must visit to this place, this is landmark of Guangzhou.Best place to visit, you can see whole city from top."
Good place to relax,"The tower has a 360 view of the whole city. It is very nice to just sit in their cafe and relax.They have restaurants in the basement, ground floor and even on the top! The top restaurants were quite expensive. It was fortunate that there was a McDonald’s on the ground floor. :)There is also a glass floor area for picture taking. Be sure to bring a long selfie stick!For those interested in construction/engineering, they also have an exhibit of the Canton tower construction.The faces in the photo are the ones in front of us so we covered their faces for privacy."
A place to view!!!,"Nice place, suberb view. Better with having a meal there!But not ideal for cloudy day!We only went to level 108!Also to add on, it is a bit costly compare to all other spending in Guangxzhou"
Impressive,I was there when the typhoon landed and had to leave the area.  Came back a few days later and got there and didn’t go up it because the clouds were to heavy to enjoy the views. However the view of it from the ground is very cool. Next time I’m back in the country I will try again.
Stunning view of tower and Guangzhou city!,"Great place to experience Guangzhou city and not to be missed event especially at night. Do enjoy the changing of colours of the tower as well as the beautiful lighting in the surrounding buildings. At the site, you can also view and walk to the public library which is so artistic and modern. At the tower, there is a mall and plenty of food for you to try. Do enjoy!"
Beautiful experience ,"It is a good experience when your in canton to watch this massive tower and view from that height where u can see entire city . It’s not only view but there some activity like sky drop, bubble tram and lot many good to try out everything ."
Outstanding - take the bubble ride,"Canton Tower can be reached via a metro line that has a station right at its base.A range of different ticket options are available, to cover the height you travel to and what other benefits you choose. An explanatory card at the ticket office, also in English, explains your options. Tickets cover a specific entry time period in order to manage the number of visitors at any time — we arrived at 11am and were in the 9-12 time slot- we were surprised how few people there were, but do not know if this is normal or not. All the organisation and arrangement on the ground and on top of the tower are smooth and professional.The view from the top is great, but obviously strongly influenced by the smog levels on the day you visit- we were lucky, and had relatively good visibility.The highlight for us was the “bubble ride”. Right at the top of the main structure, glass bubbles run on  a track that circumnavigates the entire structure. The bubbles extend out beyond the tower, so you have an unobstructed view— we were lucky enough to have s bubble to our selves, so lots of photo ops. Overall, a must do activity in Guangzhou"
Canton Tower,Nice light show. Nice views but try to go on a clear day as the smog really keeps alot off sight! You can watch the light show from across the river if you didn't like long lines at the tower entrance or arrived close to 10pm!
China's 2nd tallest tower,"Nice place to observe all of Guangzhou. Prices are reasonable, though you pay more if you wish to experience what it has to offer (i.e. higher floors, thrill rides, etc.). As with any tourist attraction, be ready to stand in line for long periods of time, plus note that some days are more smoggy than others."
Beautiful ,Beautiful views. Worth the $150 yuan entry. Great view in late afternoon into evening. Easy to get there on the APM Metro line.
Amazing Light Show at Canton Tower,The Guangzhou International Light Festival is being held. Canton Tower as the major part of the Show presents a colorful night from 7pm to 9pm to all travelers from home and abroad.
Beautiful place,"Always use to walk there with friend or solo when have free time, get away from work and city life.., also good place for show friends who visiting Guangzhou, beautiful view, location in center! Have mall and many restaurants near."
"Canton Tower, Guangzhou","I would highly recommend to view this tower and if you are prepare to pay, go to the a-la-cart chinese restaurant in the tower. There's a minimum expenditure, but u can access the higher viewing levels. They have a French and a buffet restaurant as well. Both these restaurants don't seem to hv much good opinion, that's why I chose the chinese restaurant. The prices are high, a quarter goose + wine+ extras for window seat, tea , towels is more then enough for the minimum expenditure.View is very good ,but the queue for the lift can be quiet long."
Amazing spectacular tower,This tower is amazing. It is brightly and colorfully lighted up with colours at night. The change of colours is mesmerizing and spectacular. You can stand still attracted by the constant change of colourful light  on the tower.Never miss it when you are in Guangzhou.
Phenomenal views on a clear night,"This is the third largest tower in the world. It is only worth going on a clear day/night otherwise all you see is clouds. I went up at night and the views across Guangzhou were incredible. I only did the ‘drop’ ride at the top, but would recommend getting tickets for the lookout, drop and cable car at the top. I personally think the city looks better at night given the variety of lights that come on from all the different buildings."
On a clear night....!!,"After a couple of overcast nights, we had a crystal clear evening and went to the 450th meter  level.  There are a few options, but at 450 meters, you are on an open deck with 360 degree views of all of Guangzhou.  The architecture and lights are fabulous."
Unclear ticketing ,Came here on a cloudy day - view was on unclear. Ticketing isn’t very clear and is confusing. I purchased tickets that seemingly included everything then when I was in queue - was told not included and “CANNOT” even add-on (for the peak view). The top view is in the tower of the Thrill Ride. The thrill ride was quite disappointing but the 5 seconds view above was stunning. Need to purchase the most expensive ticket of $398. The tower does not have clear directions. An external visit of the tower is sufficient.
Nice View on Canton Tower,"A major landmark in GZ city, alongside the Pearl River and bustling city skyline. Night scenery is breathtaking especially if you go out to the 450m viewing cable car platform."
at night!,take a night river cruise for 60 yuan and enjoy the lighted tower. what a nice evening tour. we took the local bus back to our hotel for only 2 yuan. highly recommended. meutermedia
Free day on business trip,This is one the many places to see in Guangzhou. This time i was lucky also since weather was great and visibility. For some reason there we practically no gueues to get in.Just needed to identify your self. The highest level was closed but got to 433meters.Great view indeed and you can find out how big the city is.
Architectural marvel,We were a group having dinner in the restaurant on the 108th floor (I think). View from restaurant was good. Also later went upto the top of the tower. The view from there is great. They have a mono-rail but it had closed by the time we reached. The staff is young and manages the crowd movement very well. The tower itself is a great architectural achievement
For Hight Spots Hunter,"Canton Tower (formal Guangzhou TV Astronomical and Sightseeing Tower )was opened 2010 for the Asian Games. In that time it was tallest tower in the world, but then 2012 Tokyo Skytree went over.  It was the tallest structure in China prior to the topping out of Shanghai Tower on 3 August 2013. Is now the second tallest tower and the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. So if you like to hunt high spots, that's the one of these. Otherwise it is quite normal sightsee place with restaurant, souvenier and before that standing in queue and go through security ceck (no lighter!) Nice is that up there is two attraction: Ferries Wheel, to carry four to six people, travel on a track round the edge of the tower's roofdesign and freefall ride.At night, the tower glows different colourfull lightshow...And now good tip: Opposite other side of Pearl River there is Park Hyat hotel, where is very nice outdoor terrace bar. There you can see tower as well citylights below ."
Guangzhou sight seeing,Awesome structure! Too bad SMOG didnt help with the visibility! 100 plus floors and with awesome LED tunnel show!
Cool but crowded ,"Too much people, it’s a tourist trap I deeply believe you can go to better places and have twice as fun!"
S shape tower,"Canton tower is he name card of Guangzhou city, everyone come to Canton should be go to the tower, specially in the night with the lights are more charming and same as lady S shape."
Perfect view,"If the weather is good, it is a very good way to spend time in Guangzhou. You will see all the beauty from birds fly. Don't be afraid to spend more time and make a ride in rail tubes on the top."
Top in Guanzhou,"One of the hihest building and the highest place I have ever been. Thi is an amazing place where you could also find shops, bars,supermarket and really worth visit."
Amazing views of Guangzhou,"Not cheap but worth the price for the amazing 360 degree views of Guangzhou. There are many ticket options, including riding the ""Bubble Pods"" on top of the tower. Not for the faint of heart."
MUST DO!!!!!,"Waited 5days for the smog to clear - glad i did! my last 2 days in China were amazing weather so ventured to the Canton Tower, payed $280Yuan for the bubble tram combo - which included ride up to 103floors to first observation level, then to level 111 which was the top with bubble tram ride. 111floor was outside, and views not that great as the bubble tram blocked alot so wort actually paying to do the ride. Nighttime would be spectacular with the city lights! i went up just on 4pm, and it was the best, the sun was low setting, made spectacular photos! if you are visiting - DONT forget to bring your passport! no Passport no entry! Got fooled into the compulsory entry photo - which one printed image (and free glass photo frame) was an extra $105yuan) but was a once off visit so had to be done!"
Artistic design,Great place.Main atrrActiom.Must visitGreat place.Main atrrActiom.Must visitEnjoyed lot watching from close distancr
Good ,Went with friends.  The view and the parks around are good.   We arrived at 9pm.   Walked around to the stadium and river.  Took pictures.  But at 10pm.  Security closed the park.  We went to the tower base.  It was under renovation so we left.
Beautiful place,Beautiful tower to see specially on clear nights. Most of the nights unfortunately there's quite a bit of smog around the tower and cannot be seen properly.
Good views but long queues,"A trip up the Canton Tower is almost mandatory if you visit Guangzhou, however be prepared for long queues to get into and out of the tower. The views from the tower are pretty good, however the lighting inside the tower needs work to reduce reflections which spoils the views a bit, along with dirty windows."
Beatiful panorama,"I was here for business trip, the pleace it is beatiful. The many lights of the tower and the background are marvellous"
Perfect place to see the city ,Yes you can get a little discount with your canton buyers badge. Great experience in bubbles tram and sky drop. Best to buy 298 元ticket. Overall mist visit in gz.
Beautiful building,Went to visit the tower with friends but did not realise we needed our passports to get in. Would not accept our drivers license so we missed out.Prepare to queue with the locals who like to push and shove so watch you space!
Canton fair ,Was here for the fair and did a bit of sight seeing. The canton tower is good. We went during the day and the visibility was not great. I think because of weather and also pollution. All and all very good. Souvenir shops are good.
Good place to visit when in Guangzhou,"We visited Guangzhou for the Canton Fair. So as part of our trip we visited the tower. Its better to see this place at night so you can appreciate the magnificence of the light changing. Not much good food stalls outside. To get here from the metro, you can alight the ""Canton Tower"" station. The fee going up the observatory deck is 150 yuan. But you can get in at 135 yuan if you are a guest at the CantonFair, just show your ID. The ticket for the Pearl River Cruise is also available at the ground floor of the tower. The place isnt big but its just the appreciation of the lights."
"great view, loads of people","very beautiful building, and easily accessible. however they need to really improve on their payment methods when getting the tickets. bring cash if you do not have a union pay credit card. try out their boat ride nearby, its pretty relaxing"
Very nice,"Very nice place, also very high tower. It take times to go up, because of the security by every entrance. I can recommend an visit"
Great place,"One of the main sights in Guangzhou! To see the city from above especially in the evening when all the city lights are lit up! And there are many souvenirs and also 2 attractions. Have been in two. One of them the drop is very frightening and your adrenaline gets high, but it was unforgettable"
Beautiful Architecture,"The Canton Tower is a beautiful landmark in Guangzhou. Getting there is very easy, one only needs to take the metro and pop out. It is a very busy landmark, and the gift shops highlight this. My view of the city by day was obstructed by the haze, and of the tower from afar, but it is still a great example of modern architecture that is also beautiful to behold."
"Architecture is a visual art, everything is designed. Few things are designed well.","Canton tower - one of the largest architecture in the world, the design is inspired from a woman’s waist. We had a great long visits during May to September, the tower is located in banks of pearl river, the tower twisted shape corresponds adziogol lighthouse in Ukraine’s dnepr delta.The tower is designed by Mark Hemel and Barbara Kuit, wonderful thing is lightening design. At night, the tower glows and emits light, rather than being uplit. Every node is individually allows for animation and colour Ganges across the entire height of the tower. The canton tower has a total height of 600m making it the tallest tower in the world from 2009 to 2011.Yes it’s a visual art, everything is designed. Few things are designed well!!"
Impressive ,"We alighted at canton tower metro stop. Metro is a safe and convenient way to travel around in Guangzhou. This is a very crowded place. The entrance ticket for an adult is 150 yuan to go to the observatory deck on level 106 n 107. We skip the snakes of queues by going for a meal at the restaurant instead. There is minimum spending of 800 yuan. The view can also be viewed from the restaurant window and u can also go to level 106 n 107 after your meal. We didn’t go to level 110 where all the excitement is though as it is very crowded on our day of visit. It is just the usual “360 Tower View” with a souvenir shop. There is also a souvenir shop on the ground floor of the Tower selling the same thing. Restaurants are also on the ground floor of the Tower. To get a Tower picture, go to the Bus parking area."
No Head For Heights!,"Having visited Guangzhou on business my guide persuaded me to go up the Canton Tower, I don’t have a head for heights and wasn’t looking forward to it, it was okay but not really for me. The little mono rail that runs round the top is a bit rickety for my liking and the way it teeters on the edge is a bit unnerving, quite glad when the experience was over, having said that the views were pretty good from the top."
lighting tower,"beautiful view of lighting at night  and you can also take river side walk ,there isa short tram ride also you can enjoy,view of canton tower from either side of river is great espesially at night"
Beautiful at night,Beautiful tower especially at night when its lighted up. Did not go up to the tower but enjoyed taking pictures from the ground.
Remember to visit levels 106 & 107,"It was the china golden week, so each ticket had a 30rmb discount (we paid 120rmb instead of the usual 150rmb)There were plenty of people taking photos, and due to the confined space it was quite noisy and loud. Not recommended to stay more than an hour.If you have Wechat pay, you can scan the qr codes and use the telescopic lenses.The night scene of guangzhou is beautiful, thought it may be difficult to take nice photos. Do go to both viewing decks and take a walk around."
Must See,Great experience to reach the top of the tower Great experience but service is not the greatest with no proper signage
A must see while in Guangzhou!,"You can get better views from the IFC tower, but here you can go outside to see the views which provides a much different experience.  I will recommend doing just not only the observatory but also the bubble tram which also gives you the opportunity to go outside.  Depending on when you go, there are long lines to get into, get in the elevator and then get into the bubble tram."
Impressive by night,My hotel was relatively near the tower so I visited the site a few times but refused to pay the extortionate fees to travel to various floors in the tower. Rather I walked around its perimeter and in the evening enjoyed the display of lights.
"Around the place, it's great.","We walked to the tower, but had to take a ferry to get there. Unfortunately, it was the wrong time to visit due to being the Mid Autumn Festival, and people were simply everywhere!The grounds on the approach were fantastic, even nicer when all the water fountains are engaged! The Opera House, Museum, the Park Plaza (forgot it's name). The latter had so many places to choose from for lunch. Our lunch was great at a Chinese restaurant.Today was a great day indeed. As for wearing a hat, it's strongly advised or al the least, bring an umbrella."
Beautiful Different tower,"I have been in many different towers around the world , but this one is unique with the cables the turn around the top point of this town, and also the ride the takes you to the highest point in Guangzhou were you can enjoy the view for few seconds then it drops you down just few meters which was not scary. The scary feeling is when you reach the highest point- it just gives you the feeling that you will be dropped down from there to the ground but actually you will be dropped down only few meters. Also the glass floor on the 100 floor where they take a picture for you and it is your choice to buy it or not . You can also choose to buy a ticket for the view deck only without the rides that are on the top ( cable + drop ride )"
Attending 122 Canton fair 2017,"Really enjoy a lot with friends to visit Canton Tower,It was a wonderful experience.There is lot of small Cruz ship at night that you can have a ride.Ticket price is normal like10/15 USD.If you are not from china then you need your passport to buy a ticket.No traveler are aloud on board without a valid passport and visa."
Canton Tower,"I caught the metro to the Canton Tower. I paid the top price 398 rmb for the chance to go to the highest point able to access. Views were amazing, although pollution does reduce visibility. The bubble tram was cool. I chose to miss the ride, a drop style ride, which was really enjoyed by braver souls than I. Had lunch at a cafe up there too."
Awesome! ,"Great place to watch The City of Guangzhou! We went here during lunch time, it was very crowded. The best time to visit this place is weekdays and during night time as the night view is spectacular! It cost 150 Yuan per person. And there is a time slot which determine when you will be able to enter the elevator to the top."
great View over Guangzhou,"I recently visited for work and a private function but was able to go to the top to get a view over Guangzhou on the revolving floor area and it was great at night with all the different lights and neon around the city, it was moon pie festival weekend and there were thousands of people around the site as it was like a bank holiday in England, lost of families and kids around.a great attraction if you like landmarks although i did not see too much round to do.lots of food outlets in and around worth alook if you have time."
Spectacular Views!,Well worth the wait! Queues are insane so be prepared to wait. Ground staff didn't speak much English. You have to figure it out.
Just for the lights show,At least I did not go insideBut just from outside ITVs stunningWith the light displayAnd with all the cruise boats that pass by at the river just front ofMagic
AMAZING experience ,We bought the most expensive package (around 400) but it was worth it because we got to go to re very top and have the most magical view over the city and also try the crazy rides at the top.
Nothing of special,"Not so much as Guangzhou symbol!!!I was lookinf for the tower but when I saw it , it disappointed me! Enough to not pay to go upstairs More charming during the night ...."
Excellent visit on a clear day,"I loved my visit to Canton Tower.   Easy to access from the metro station and would advise going quite early in the morning to avoid the queues as it does seem to get very busy.  Buying tickets was very easy and we went to the 108th floor. There are higher areas and attractions that can be visited at an extra cost - but the 108th floor was high enough for me !   Lovely views of this enormous city from the tower - all very well organised with high security presence, and elevator attendant.   Enjoyed coffee and cake on the 107th floor coffee shop while admiring the wonderful views."
Canton Tower,"You can probably spend most of the day at the Canton Tower then finish the day with the River Cruise a short walking distance away.  The best deal is to purchase tickets to the highest view point as this includes all the other benefits of the tower.  My daughter and I purchased these tickets.  We started at the top.  This is an open air landing so they advised not put our hands and items over the ledge.  Here is where you get a great view of Guangzhou. We then headed down to the next lower viewing point which has a ride with enclosed carriages that go around slowly on the outside of the ledge.  This provided great picture opportunities for us. At this level our tickets also allowed us to go on a ride that  goes to the top of the building and suddenly drop.  This is for the 'brave riders' so my daughter enjoyed this by herself while I took a video of her.  This level also has a larger viewing point with the opportunity to take pictures with the City of Guangzhou in the background.  We went to other lower indoor viewing levels and enjoyed taking pictures of ourselves and pictures from the professional photographers they at a couple of the photo op stations.  There are restaurants on a couple of the upper floors but we ate lunch at a fabulous restaurant on the main level.  By the time we were finished exploring the upper floors, going on the rides and eating, dusk had fallen.  We found that our tickets allowed us to enter a large outside balcony on the second floor.  The outside entrance is on the main level.  There is security posted there so we had to show our tickets.  I don't think many people realized that tickets in the category we purchased allowed this access as there were few people on the balcony.  This afforded us the opportunity to take pictures on the steps with the lit tower in the background.  The balcony was an amazing place to take pictures of the tower at night.  The balcony also overlooks the river so we were able to take pictures of the lights of the buildings across the water as well as the lit boats sailing by.  We had reserved tickets for the boat ride at 8:10p.m. so we ending our night with that."
You haven’t seen Guangzhou until you’ve done the Tower,If you can get up to the viewing decks on a good clear day you will be amazed.Super fast lifts. Well organised. Easy to find with good access from the metro line 3.
Good,Having beautiful loactions which makes me to attract and having place which was very good atmosphere and makes to stay there
Breathtaking Views,"Iconic tower, stunning night lights and truly majestic. A symbol that represents Guangzhou. A place to must visit if you are in town. Amazing !"
Super tower,Great heights! Great views of the city of Guangzhou. Don’t miss this place if you’re visiting! Canton tower is one landmark that will give you a clear Birdseye view of the entire city.
Really attractive,We were there at night. It was a little crowded but we had no problem going up. The view to colorful buildings and the river was perfect. It was really high enough to watch a vast area of the city. It's so fascinating. Recommended to visit seriously.
Nice!,Recommended to everyone! You can visit the Canton Tower at night to see the colourful lights or during day!
A bit of repair going on,"HiIf your looking to experience the view . Yes it is a winner. The science emporium is closed at the moment, also the ride. If you decide to experience the top platform, you can pay cash at the gateTake your passport."
The World's tallest TV Tower- with great views!,"At 604 meters this is a really tall structure [at one time the World's tallest]!  The iconic Tower is located beside the Pearl River-- opposite to Huacheng (Flower City) Square, and its many outstanding attractions and huge underground shopping  mall.  The Tower offers several views (from different heights and costs) as well as restaurants [the excellent revolving French Restaurant also offers a trip to the higher observation areas] and bars.  One of the viewing areas also allows one to walk around the tower [590 meters] and view the surrounding suburbs!   One can also take a river cruise-- and at night the Tower is well lit up-- making for a spectacular sight!!  I hope that this review has been helpful."
Maybe the most beautiful tower..,"Yes, for us it is the most beautiful tower.. also because there are no other skyscrapers or buildings next to it what makes it even more special. It‘s beautiful shape should represent the first female tower.. that‘s what we have read.To visit the tower and enjoy the views you have four different options, starting at 150rmb per person, -> check picture. With the cheapest ticket it‘s not possible to get to the Bubble tram platform. (Bring your Passport).Unfortunately we didn‘t have very nice weather, evenzhough while it‘s dark the surroundings and the skyline can be seen quite well. Don‘t know how it is if the weather is really bad.Furthermore, on the normal indoor observatory platform there is the highest post office in the world. 2 postcards to Europe incl. stamps had a cost of 15rmb. You can put a stamp of the tower into your passport as amemory :-)Even it was a weekday and weather not very good, make sure you plan enough waiting time for the ticket and the elevator if you want to be there right before sunrise or around a specific time. It took as about 35min to get to the top.Overall, it‘s a great experience to visit the tower itself. Nevertheless we really enjoyed the views of the tower from different perspectives after dark. So if the combo ticket is too expensive or you expect weather conditions to make views miserable, don’t worry, we were happy with 150rmb platform and enjoyed the free ground views of the tower from different perspectives in the city even more. For us it is the most special tower especially when the lights start to illuminate this incredible structure."
Amazing views of guangzhou from the tower,We had afternoon tea in the French restaurant and the restaurant was amazing with the revolving. The best way to view the tower is to buy the restaurant ticket and you get to visit the Upper Tower. Nice experience l.
Nice tower but quite pricey to go to higher levels,We went to the tower but time did not permit us to go to the higher heights so we took a river cruise to watch it from afar with the lights ablaze. awesome sight
Standard fare for tourist travel in Guangzhou,I not only took the tour to the top of the Canton Tower but I lived just a few blocks from in near the Pearl River.   The kaleidoscope of colors can be mesmerizing.   Canton Tower is also a focal point for night time Pearl River cruises.   We have some great photos of it from the river cruise.   There are plenty of places for high rise views in Guangzhou but the Canton Tower is one spot that is impossible to forget!
Private Dining like no other ,"After a day sightseeing in Guangzhou, my local guides treated me to a private dining experience in the Chinese restaurant at the tip of the tower. Fantastic views over the city. A great way to end the holiday."
Beautiful from far away,"This tower is the symbol of Guangzhou today and although beautiful from a distance, the experience of visiting is as expected, a hassle, a drag, and mostly boring (not to mention very expensive). When they first opened, some 7 years ago,  it was great. Not many people. Quick climb to the top, a lot of crazy attractions, and even a small outdoor balcony at around 500 meters high (!) Absolutely Incredible.However, that’s all in the past. That balcony is closed. Most attractions are closed. The climb upstairs takes a long long line of waiting and then some more waiting, and a weird lecture in Chinese, then more waiting, and then if you’re lucky, maybe you can get a place in 1 of the 2 elevators available. An embarrassment. Stay away."
Must visit but getting a taxi is a issue,Wow moment.if you are in gun. Please make sure u will visit canton tower .taxi is a big issue as taxi driver will charge you extra money .
Restaurant is not too good,Old restaurant but food beautiful   Price was ok. Not too expensive. But the view is wasn’t nice as I expected.
The Gem of GuangZhou,"If you can read chinese, pls get your ticket via online website. Can be access via metro station/local taxi If you taking taxi, please don’t get directly at the venue, walk further away 5-10mins and hail. So it don’t show you are foreigner that just visited Canton Tower.Insist for meter taxi , walk away if their give you flat rate price"
Nice at night,"Place was really crowded as I visited on a weekend night but the tower was the centre of attraction. If you want nice photos, might be a good idea to walk slightly further away from the tower. The colour of the tower changes from time to time."
"Great Views, then what?","I’ve been to the top of the New and Old World Trade Center, Empire State Building, Eiffel tower, Tokyo Tower, and John Hancock Tower.The view rivaled the Old World Trade Center.  It was spectacular.  Crowded of course, as this is China.  Nevertheless, we got through the lines and to the top quickly.  We ogled the views for 15 Minutes, and figures that we had checked the box.My suggestion would be to have lunch at the Mediterranean  or French restaurant, and soak up the sites.  It is also better to come thin the Daun especially one where the haze is lower."
River and Tower side by side.,"I visited Canton Tower on 31st December 2017. It was too much crowdy . I was able to see young beautiful faces  chines and other . Aloud music across the river , lighting and fun. Perl River was flowing silently..  It was full of peace and calmness."
good view,"was recommend by locals, top view ok, price expensive, service ok, food average at best, not sure if I'd do it again."
Up up in the Guangzhou sky,"If you have been to Guangzhou and not been here ... you are missing out !!Easy to buy tickets onsite , efficient staff , great views... and surprisingly great coffee on the observation deck cafe! Great part of Guangzhou, big open areas .. worth the visit :) Day I was there the open deck was closed due to bad weather , views were amazing even in a cloudy day !Highly recommend this as tourist stop."
Must visit ,Should reach early as there is lots of rush . Do carry your passport as it is mandatory to buy the tickets ... not much of English there but it’s a nice view
Amazing,"The landmark of Guangzhou that stood beautifully at the center of the city. You should go inside the tower and buy the ticket to the highest level! The view of Guangzhou and Zhujiang river was too breakthtaking, especially at night. It was definitely my favorite place during my study in Guangzhou."
Tower,"Honestly, it's just like any tower in different city around China. Pricey to get to the top. Building next to the tower actually look better. Surrounding area are good, below the tower there is an AMR line, so easy to access. There is a huge underground shopping center below the tower are, and huge selection of high end restaurants and bars across the street."
Stunning!,This amazingly beautiful tower can be seen from many miles around. Called the narrow waste tower by locals when you see it you will know why. Colours are incredible!
Disappointed ,"We were there about 8pm and it’s very crowded so we didn’t managed to get up, luckily we managed to get the ferry ticket to see the night scene"
Wonderful icon of the city ,I've not been on top but just down looking at it.During the night is plenty of changing colour lights.Amazing icon of the city visible all over.Near it there is also nice view of river and skyview
Tower in the skyline,"Headed to Guangzhou after our Zhuhai trip and first stop was this Canton Tower or the Guangzhou Tower on top. Its not so attractive because we went there in the middle of the day and its so hot. we cant get a nice view of the tower thus, went to a nearby park to get a view of the tower. our tour guide it would have been beautiful if we were there in the evening because of the lights. Nonetheless, it was an attraction in Guangzhou worth the visit"
Magnificent ,"Beautiful, if you don't plan to spend $ going up then don't go to the tower,  go across the river bank where u can take a better pic of the tower.  On level 2 of tower can take great pic of the buildings across the river bank"
"On the top or bottom, river tour","Nice to have a tour by boat, to see all around the tower and well-lightened surroundings. i had a chance to have a boat trip, next time to try on the top is a must."
Went twice...,"Did this at night the first time to get the night time skyline for photos and the line was a solid 40 minutes to get to the inner/inside observation deck.  Came back next day to go to the top, outdoor deck and ride the infamous ""orange spheres of death!""  Worth the time and wait.  Very cool.  Elevator down is GLASS DOOR and on the side so make sure you are the last people/person in."
Spectacular views,Absolutely breathtaking views from the top. Lines are long though and staff are not always friendly. But the experience makes that completely irrelevant. A must visit when in Guangzhou.
A towering achievement? - yeah kinda,"No two ways about it - the Canton Tower is a pretty impressive.Interestingly, they charge by elevation - the higher you go the more you pay.We were a little gob-smacked by the level of security with photos taken and three showings of the passport to get to the elevators.  (yep - don't forget to at least have a photocopy of your passport)Once you are up there its pretty impressive however and you get a real sense of just how huge Guangzhou is"
Good site,"Great views, particularly from the bubble car tram. And the drop ride was a thrill.  Lunch at the revolving “Mediterranean” buffet was a disappointment - you expect it to be pricey, but you don’t expect mediocre to bad food.  Would do it again but skip the restaurant"
Rainbow candle stick in the middle of the night,"It is not necessary for you to get up to the tower if you have been to many. But it is definitely worth it look at the tower at night from Huacheng Avenue. Worth to spend  good evening stroll down the avenue, if you really fancy to go to the tower, there is Metro station bring you there. The view under the tower is very nice, especially right beside the river."
Too many people.  Too hot,Cramped No airconNoisyLines too longToo expensive Views pretty good but the pillars often obstruct viewRestaurant on 106 floor is average and VERY expensive.  View from table is not goodBest item was the LG Digital display on level 1 when leavingWould not return
Nice but chaotic,"Of course the view is amazing. The lineups to get tickets were long. 3 times you had to show your passport, like going airport security. Then lineup for the lift. Then at the observation deck you have to line up to get a spot at the window. Just too many people. The line up for the bubble tram was just too much for us to do so we didn’t do it. It was ok, but can’t say it was worth what it cost."
Stunning Views of Guangzhou,"If you are visiting Guangzhou you must visit Canton Tower. The viewing deck offers stunning views of the city, and if you are willing to spend a few extra RMB you can go even higher in the tower and climb a glass staircase, ride around the top of the tower in a glass bubble and experience the incredible thrills of the worlds highest vertical drop at the top of the tower! Canton Tower is a must see!"
Canton Tower,"I great stop on a tour of Guangzhou. Have a beautiful view of Guangzhou from the top of the tower, especially at night. Up at the top you can also take a ride on a bubble car that goes round the building or for the brave, try the Sky Drop."
This it something special,"I really enjoyed the magnificent views and intresting exebitions. It is a bit pricey, but there was few people and no lines on the day I showed up."
Beautiful at Night,"Definitely go once the sun sets, the colours are beautiful. We didn’t get to go up the tower but a walk along the water with all the night lights on either side of you is lovely to see."
excelent view,Better visit in the evening to see Guangzhou. Perfect panoramic view. High speed lift on the top of the tower.
Beautiful place to visit,"The tower itself and all surroundings are a really nice place and completely worth the visit. Make sure to have a good weather to enjoy the most of it,"
WOW,"The Canton Tower offers some of the best views of Guangzhou to be seen anywhere.  The tickets are priced by how high you want to go.  To go to the highest lookout was ¥488.00, this included the slow 360* ride and the sky drop ride.  These at automatically included and there was no bargaining.  The access to the tower is very secure.  You will pass through a security check point and many passport inspections.  YOU MUST HAVR YOUR PASSPORT AS A FOREIGNER!!!  My family and I went up at 4:30pm.  We spent sever hours walking and looking.  There are several lookouts points on the way up with many picture spots.  To be honest, watching the sunset from the top of the tower and seeing Guangzhou light up was amazing!!!  I will do that again."
must see in guangzhou,very beautiful place must see while in Guangzhou especially at night or from the riverside it looks beautiful
Good View in the evening,Very good view at the observation deck at 400+meters high.  The staffs were nicely to guide you to the route of the high-speed elevators.  It may cause you spending more time waiting than expected as the queues was a little bit long when you takes the elevators down to the lobby.
Beautiful at night ,"It's beautiful at night, but don't come to Canton tower station. To take a photo with it, it's too crowded and you can find betters  spots, like zhujiang new town."
Great view at sunset,"This is an impressive building with fabulous views and I would recommend visiting at sunset for the lights of Guangzhou. That being said, this is very expensive place to visit. The price starts from RMB150 for the indoor observation deck at 433 meters but you can spend up to RMB 398 per person if you want access to the outside observation deck and rides. The queues are very long and you will need a passport to buy tickets. I only went to the indoor observation deck and queued a long time but once there, it didn't take long to admire the view and take a few photos. I'm still not sure if it was worth the wait and cost."
Great view of Guangzhou and fun amusement ride,"The view from the tower is amazing. If the weather is good and the skies are clear, go on the bubble tram outside at the top level and you can get great views of the entire city from above.  This costs extra money compared to going just to the windowed- in ""view decks"" which are crowded and have some girders blocking parts of the view.  Among the stores available at the ground level is Pacific Coffee, which is one of my favorites."
Superb view by the river with F&B outlets,"A nice place to have evening walk from Malls of the world to canton tower. Beautiful light up buildings around the area. place is clean. After a long walk, spend some time at the bar to chill out. Month of May tend to be very hot and humid."
Fabulous view but not worth the visit ,Super crowded and expensive. Experience was somewhat similar to Taipei 101. View was great but would not visit again.
Foreigners be prepared,"Foreigners need their passports to buy tickets and gain entry. I had a copy of mine and the lady was hesitant to even take that. Advice is to just atleast have a copy of your passport anywhere you go. All these tourist places all of a sudden won't let you in if you are not a native and don't have it.There are a ton of ticket vendors, not all of them or just for the tower. If the vendor is inside (in a closed space under the tower, i.e. the west ticket gate) then it is for the tower. Only the ground part is free. To go up any floor requires a ticket. The price from floor one up to the observation deck is 150 yuan, or about $25USD. Further than that is more money, and the amusement park rides at the top each require their own payment I believe. The only way to get up into the tower is to go through the ticket vendor and then through security. Beware of misdirection. If you simply walk under Canton tower and go down the escalators in the middle, that will take u to the subway and away from the tower. On the plus side, there are lots of restaurants and drinks shops on ground level. Pearl river is across the street so you can easily do a city bus tour or boat cruise afterwards. The boat dock near Canton tower is always crowded with a huge line, so I suggest finding another one down the river. The one near sun yat sen south gate is never busy. And to purchase tickets for the boat cruise it is best and easiest if you have wechat pay or allipay on your phone. Alot of places have automatic machines where cash isn't excepted and the human teller usually has a swarm of people around them. Many people were presenting their IDS so you may need your passport there too."
What a view,"You can see how big is the city from the tower top and, let me say, it is impressive and never ending. We god also a buffet lunch at the 108 floor.A touristic spot and not an hidden gem but I would definitely recommend to pay a visit if in GZ"
Mesmerising view ,Very good place to see. Specially at night. There is a ride available at the top scary but must try. Must see place in Guangzhou.
