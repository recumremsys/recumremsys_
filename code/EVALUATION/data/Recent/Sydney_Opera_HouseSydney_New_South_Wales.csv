A peaceful visit to our amazing Iconic structure,The current significantly reduced tourism numbers in Sydney meant we could enjoy the beauty of the Opera House and it's surrounds in peace and quiet.
Family Night Visit,Fantastic and family safe environment (night time)Busy as you would expect for a tourist destinationClean public areaWorld class views
One of the world‚Äôs most magnificent opera houses & a jewel in Sydney‚Äôs crown,I wanted to take in the magnificence of The Sydney Opera House‚Äôs architecture.It is iconic. I climbed the stairs & I walked around & marvelled at the beauty of this building against the surrounding deep blue waters of Sydney Harbour. Bring your family. Bring your friends. This visit shall stay with you always. Bring a hat on a hot Summer‚Äôs day. Bring your bottled water. So many great places to eat. You may even bring your own lunch & enjoy on the stairs. Spectacular views.
Sydney's World Heritage Site,"Danish architect Jorn Utzon  (1918-2008) was only the second person to have his creation declared a World Heritage Site in his lifetime.  The Sydney Opera House, when it opened in 1973, became known as an Australian icon. Take time to look it over inside, you may never have the chance again."
Australia's most famous building,"The Sydney Opera House is Australia's most spectacular building. It is a unique design, and went wildly over budget. It was paid for by a special lottery. The Opera House is fascinating, it was worth the money -- not only did Sydney gain a world-class Opera House, it gained a building that put Australia on the map."
Beautiful,"We hadn't had the chance to go inside, but the outside is very beautiful, it is a futuristic monument, what a great job"
Best city in the world,"Great architecture,  you might see a seal sunbathing down the back and just outside the entrance to the botanical gardens."
A functional attraction,Elegant and graceful sails make this a big attraction on its own. A complicated piece of engineering that is now part of Sydney's skyscape.
Wow what a building,"Wow, what a great building.  Interesting how it was built.  The photos of the construction project are amazing!! We could not get tickets to a show.  But we did go back in the evening for the light and slide show projected on the sails of the opera house.  Very very cool!!"
Its always fun to take a way around,"Its always busy but such a nice walk, stop and listen to the various poles that talk about the history, really interesting"
Opera House,Not too bad if you haven't been before.Great view to the inside and different areas of the opera house and some history of the building. Magnificent structure
One of Sydney's spectacular attractions,"Even if you don't attend one of the Opera House's plays, symphonies or operas, all visitors to Sydney should go and wander around the outside and inside of his architectural wonder."
So beautiful!,Nice place.The Sydney Opera House!  It is a multi-venue performing arts centre  and one of the 20th century's most famous  buildings
Beautiful!,Simply beautiful and amazing this iconic structure. Nice place to visit while in Sydney. Highly recommend!
Interested Most in the Hall Not the Concert,"We arrived a few monutes late for the concert and found it easy to get seated.  The Hall is spectacular, of course, and that was the main reason for our visit.  The Concert was not in our keen interests, but we marveled at the musicianship - and the unending encores (30 minutes)!  A gorgeous setting at the Harbor.  When we exited the Hall, the lighting, people, water, and views of the Sydney were wonderful."
Nice walk,"Just a sight seeing trip, was really enjoyable to see a great feet of engineering ! Especially with the harbour bridge so close ! Area close is expensive but good to see !"
Walking tour of opera house,"The main hall of the building was closed, but we weren't informed of this. The guide was pleasant but kept going off on tangents that were irrelevant to the building. Wasn't really worth the money."
Smaller than expected,Judging from the photos I had seen I expected a much larger building. But it's very nice and harmonious.  Both on the outside and from inside. There are numerous restaurants and caffees around it for pre-performance meal.
"The good, the bad and the uncomfortable","Just barely pre-COVID, we spent five days in Sydney. We bought tickets to see the opera, Carmen, months before because...Sydney Opera House. It worked out that we were booked for a backstage tour earlier that day, so we picked up our tickets while we there.The tour was fantastic. Our guide was knowledgeable and so helpful. He managed to get the headphones working for two members of our group who had hearing problems, His insights on the architecture, history and  politics were witty and entertaining. The building is beautiful but the seats we had were very uncomfortable. With nearly a foot difference in height, both of us were uncomfortable. The acoustics were wonderful, even detrimentally so, as one of the leads had quite a screeching voice. We decided to leave at the interval and spent quite a while sitting outside of the opera house, enjoying the harbour lights, the parade of life around us, and the wonderful balmy night. It was quite magical.Other companions on the tour discovered that they could reserve seats to the opera and got a fabulous deal on seats for the next night. I think they could choose from any available seats in the house for $99, which meant they saved about $300 on the seats they got! They also decided to have the set meal and raved about the food. We had decided to go to one of the outdoor restaurants along the esplanade and thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered there. Frankly, we couldn‚Äôt get enough of the views and the atmosphere."
Wander around the quay. ,What a picturesque part of the world. We loved walking around the area & as there weren‚Äôt many people around it was really quiet. Every venue we went to had hand sanitizers & followed Covid processed üëç
Beautiful architecture,Don't miss this at all! It is not only beautiful to look at from afar but internally the architecture is just stupendous! Take a tour ! It is worth!
Beautiful Building,The Opera House was everything that the photos show to visitors around the world. Up close it is even more impressive. One has the opportunity to take a tour of the three Halls but since there was no guarantee that the Halls would be available to see (due to rehearsals) we chose not to take a chance.  We walked underneath the building and around it and could see the upper floors but just could not go inside the Halls.
Majestic site,The opera house is truly a majestic site. Very overcast day. Very popular with tourist. The tour was fully booked out. The is a really nice restaurant there so you can enjoy a meal while overlooking the harbor. Well worth a visit to see this iconic land mark
A wonder of the world.,"Almost 50 years old this amazing building still takes your breath away. Its free to walk around the exterior or you can take a guided tour inside. Even better, catch a show or a concert there. Dont let the name mislead you though. Its not just opera thats available Bands such as The Cure, Morrissey, Patti Smith have all performed there. The drama theatre a smaller space is used for plays. And dont forget the sublime Bennelong restaurant is there too."
Timeless and iconic ,"No matter how many times I have seen it, it wows me every time. No matter how many photos I have taken of it, I always want to take more. Its magic lasts forever."
Still Remarkable,"At this certain times, a simple photograph with friends behind this means something! Still and will always be a lovely place to check it out!"
"Unique designed building, worth seeing.",You won't find something quite like this elsewhere in the world as its shape is very unique. I haven't had much reason to go inside but sitting outside is great for relaxing and absorbing the scenery.
Screams Sydney!,"The most iconic building in Sydney is a feast for the eyes with an interesting history.  It juts out into the harbor and at times it appears larger than I expected and then surprisingly smaller than I expected, depending upon the angle.  The late modern expessionist design is one you don't see every day.  It covers 4.4 acres of land and is 600' long and 394' wide with over one million shell-like tiles.  Architect Jorn Utzon designed the masterpiece that was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973.  There are tours as well as various performances throughout the year.  Book ahead if possible since it has over 8 million visitors each year."
Impressive building,"The Sydney Opera House is synonymous with Sydney and Australia. Its beauty is internationally recognised and there would be few people, or at least very few travellers, who would not be able to identify it. We often come here for a walk around the building or in the vicinity. It is a place you can never get tired of visiting."
World Famous,"This is one of the most famous building in the world. Beautiful architecture especially at night. Its beautiful whether you see it from the ferry, from Sydney bridge or close up. A must see Iconic building when in Sydney."
Enjoyable visit to an iconic spot!,"I honestly don't know if this was the specific tour we did or not, but it was a guided tour of the opera house.  I really enjoyed seeing this iconic location!  The tour guide made a few accommodations to avoid steps for our older group of visitors, which was very much appreciated."
Beautiful architecture.,"Spectacular architecture, we bought a ticket to visit inside the Opera House, it was a guided tour with details of the history of the building."
Iconic of Sydney,"No mistaking where you are in the world, synonymous with Sydney. From the river or up close it is a stunning building."
A Must See On A SHort Layover,"I was on an 8 hour layover o my way to New Zealand and the Opera House was a short trainride away. As you alight from the train coming straight from the airport you can already see this important landmark of Sydney.If you are on a short layover in Sydney this is an attraction that should be in your itinerary, My only regret is that I wasnt able to go inside because there was a scheduled performance."
Beautiful Building,The entire opera house complex is truly spectacular and well worth a visit.  There are a number of tours.  We did the breakfast tour which was  disappointing but overall the whole water front area and the opera house is a place you should visit.
A True Icon,"Now, we didn't go inside the building some take that in mind - but seeing this icon in-person was a delight. There's great people-watching. It's hard to really understand just how large the opera house is - it's massive and easy to get to."
Stunning Building,This is a great tour. Guides are well informed. I didn't know any of the history of the building but its construction was full of scandal. The interior is even more amazing than the outside. I was disappointed that the main performance hall is closed for renovation but discovering so many other details about the structure satisfied my curiosity. I have some health issues and there are many stairs but I was able to handle them.  I would only suggest that the Opera House maybe add some posters of the main performance hall so the tours can have a glimpse of the inside.
Unique experience. A must do when in Sydney,"Got ourselves tickets for the opera. It's one thing to look at the building from outside, but 10 times the experience when go inside to watch a performance. The atmosphere is marvellous. The views are wonderful from the terraces before and after the performance looking back to the city and over the water."
An absolute must-do. Don't miss it,"We managed to get on an early tour without a booking, and we really came up up trumps with our guide (can't remember his name......). He was warm, welcoming, passionate about every aspect of the Opera House covered in the tour and very knowledgeable. He had the ability to make you feel you were an important and special group. We saw and learnt so much during the tour. This is a 'must do' for anyone visiting Sydney. And great value too."
A great Visit,"This was a fantastic visit to an iconic building, seen the pictures but to go inside and have the tour was great, it was very interesting and made up of separate sections.  Tour was well organised and the guide was excellent, shop was good and loos were very clean. It was also a  lovely sight when we sailed out at midnight and it was all lit up - very memorable"
Great tour,"We had a great tour guide.  She was very knowledgeable and friendly.  She also took us into a theatre where they were rehearsing for one of their upcoming shows.  At the conclusion of our tour, some individuals in our group were able to purchase tickets for a show that evening that is normally sold out.  We returned to the Opera House at sunset to view the Badu Gili Water Light display that was projected on the eastern Bennelong sail.  This was available twice a night with the first one at sunset.  It was a free experience and very well done.  I am not sure if this was just being offered while we visited in February or if it‚Äôs available year round.  Check with the Opera House to obtain the viewing times."
Excellent tour!,"This was a"" must"" tour for me and I am certainly glad that we persevered through the gale force winds and rain to make it happen!  We were staying at a harbour hotel close to the opera house but still needed a taxi to get there due to the terrible weather. But it was so worth the extra effort.  The guide was a young woman full of energy and excitement for the opera house. She gave an excellent history and background for the opera house and we walked through many sections of it. The main auditorium was breathtaking with even an explanation for the flooring and type of seating (which was funny and memorable) provided. Small gift shop with unique offerings was located at the meeting point for the tour. The many eateries outside (underneath the walkway above) were nice and provided snacks while we waited for our tour to begin.  Don't miss this tour!"
Beautiful Place,"One of the beautiful place to visit once in a life time with your friends or family, awesome architecture, must see attraction.."
L√° Boeme opera,Sydney Opera is an √≠con of arquitecture and Sydney postcard. We assist the opera LA Bo√©me and was fantastic. At night the several lights of the building turns it attonishing.
The outside is the best part,"I was impressed by the tiles of the opera house. The tour guide or docent said if all the tiles were white then it‚Äôd blind people.  There‚Äôs about 3 colors. Inside looks like the 1970s, but there are some windows that are cool and main auditorium has great acoustics."
Lived up to expectations ,Has the wow factor. Lived up to expectations. Arriving by ferry coming around from Darling Harbour & gettingcthat first glimpse was breathtaking
A masterpiece of design and engineering,"We were unable to enter the Opera House, but walked around it caught ferries to see all sides of it, and looked at it from the window of our hotel in Circular Quay. Originally the cost of building the Opera House infuriated the people of NSW, but now everyone recognises the genius of the Danish architect. Mind you, I've read that the main theatre inside is not really suited for performances of opera! The stage is too small and the wings and fly space above the stage lack space. As a consequence,Opera  Australia has to make sets fit the Sydney venue but they are too small for Melbourne's State Theatre. That's what trying to cut costs does!"
Iconic Opera House pity about the brutalist interior.,"This was going to be one of the highlights of our trip to Australia.  The Opera House is not pretty inside as it is finished in brutalist cement. Moreover, the toilets are situated in awkward places. We wanted to have a bite at the Bennelong Restaurant and Bar, probably the best restaurant in Sydney.  A helpful member of staff took us to the restaurant, which is inside the Opera House.  Unfortunately, Bennelong serves a fixed menu (there is no a la carte) at A$150 per person, which I would have paid happily but  I was not hungry and my wife is a light eater. Fortunately, not all was lost and we got in for the light supper, which was better than nothing and so my wife ordered some sort of vegetable ball, which was very good according to her. I had the Tasmanian Yabbies (a small crayfish), which was perfect.  We moved on to the Northern Bar, with a great view of Sydney Harbour. There are no tables or chairs  where to sit and there is no waiter service. .The auditorium has good acoustics but does not have the majesty of other Opera Houses around the world. We saw Carmen but the performance lacked the sexual frisson that attracts Don Jos√©.to Carmen ( Veronica Simeoni I think), who   looked as though she was not happy showing her thighs.The choreography was too fast and contrived. Finally, the costumes were just too shiny. I have never seen such a long queue to use the men‚Äôs facilities during the interval. It is clear that the place does not have enough toilets."
Beautiful Opera House Architecture iconic of Sydney,"This is not a review of the complete architecture of the Sydney Opera House.  However, is is an appreciation of the exterior beauty of this gem of Sydney.  The placement of the building on the harbor is just brilliant.  The peaking arches of the roof line resemble a ships sails jutting out to sea.  The lighting, the walkways, and the General design of the entrance mall draw the viewer in to experience the entire building.  There is a really nice establishment also on the grounds, though I was unable to take advantage of it, I am told by local residents it is excellent.  Superior food and beverages.  With a harbor view of the busy ferries on one side and the Lovely Opera House on the other, along with an entrance to the botanical gardens a very short walk away."
Peter Hayen ,Hotel very good but caterers food awful. Unfortinately hotel seems unable to change caterer.Looking forward to going home on Saturday.
Amazing Performance in an Incredible Venue,I went to see a Jazz Band at the Opera House. My first show seen there.  It was amazing and I just couldn't believe how excellent the sound and acoustics were for such a big room. Just beautiful.  What an experience.
Sydney in One Picture,"Nothing more symbolizes Sydney more than the Opera House.  Easy to get to on foot, and easy access to walk around the outside...I can't review the inside due to not going inside...but the outside cafe does a very good latte, and has brilliant views of the harbour.  Outside of the Opera House gets very busy with people jostling for picture opportunities."
See something at the PAC!,Great harbor stroll and one woman play: Songs for Nobodies. Had a tour the previous day which was very informative and made going to see a show that much more special.
Most Visitors Never Get To See This,"My wife and I didn't really know what to expect. Frankly we aren't theatre people and don't really have a grasp of what happens behind the scenes, so this was really an eye opener for us. We were so impressed with the entire operations of the Opera House below the floors and behind the scenes. This is one giant, constantly moving operation. I was blown away at how they get the sets moved around and keep so many plays, shows and performances happening at the same time.So even if you're not a theatre person take this tour. You will never look at a play or performance the same again - and you'll be seeing behind the scenes of the most impressive theatre/opera house in the world."
Fabulous evening!,"Went to see Carmen by Opera Australia.  Booked seats several weeks earlier online. Very straightforward process.  Wonderful evening. Had drinks beforehand in Opera bar, silly prices but hey!   Then ordered interval drinks in one of the  bars. Again despite the huge audience, all very easy and no queues.  Enjoyed the interval on the theatre terrace with fabulous views over the harbour.  The show too was excellent, fabulous acoustics, great performances from all the cast.  A must do in Sydney"
Tourist visit,Went to see the Opera House. Spectacular! Took the hour tour and it was well worth it. Just walking around it was enjoyable and relaxing. Ate outside and food served there was very good. Need to go back to attend a concert.
Just a tour of the Opera House,"The Sydney Opera House grounds and the story behind the design and construction are very interesting. Our tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable. It has so many different venues inside, crowd control must be a nightmare. Definitely a ""must see"" when you visit Sydney."
A must do for a real Opera Experience.,"Wow wow wow! The Opera House is a sight to behold, for us it was love at first sight and we knew we needed to experience an opera first hand.We managed to get very reasonably priced tickets for the final performance of Don Giovanni in the Dame Joan Sutherland Theatre. There are not enough words to say this was a world class performance with world class performers. The staging was understated perfection. The whole experience of being in such an iconic building was overwhelming."
Totally iconic,"So many reviews for this iconic land mark, so I attended a performance of Carmen here totally awesome experience absolutely loved the theatre, as good on the inside as the outside. You really can‚Äôt visit Sydney without seeing this building it dominates just about every tourist photos ! of course there‚Äôs more to Sydney than one building but it is simply iconic, love it or hate it ! My impression was I thought it was bigger, not to say it‚Äôs not large it is but from the many photos I thought it was more prominent but it remains a stunning building !"
"Cream, beige, taupe, ivory, mushroom, milky coffee, dirty?","Sydney Opera House (SOH) is photoshopped. Why has no one told me it's not white?  Perhaps there's a conspiracy of silence and tourists sign a declaration stating they will not divulge the secret of its colour. I didn't sign up.I'm a very visual person, I like my eyes to be pleased, and if you're expecting one thing and are presented with another, it's a bit of a shock. Truthfully, SOH would be better white, but I guess a paint job would be a never ending task, unless they use the souped up variety that the Forth Road/Rail? Bridge is bedecked with these days. Once I'd recovered, I concentrated on the interior, which is keeping itself up to date, construction work currently improving, most importantly ,access to amenities for everyone. I'm not sure what's woke these days for 'disabled'.Our Official Guide (of long-standing) loves the place, and communicates that passion such that it's contagious. Of special note was the history of the award to Jorn Utzon (Danish) , as Architect and the dance that was conducted between Utzon, the construction process and the Sydney big-wigs. Not a happy tale, but it was eventually alright on the night.To be honest, it was the Guide and the delivery of his knowledge that will stay with me. Opera Houses/Concert Halls without performers interacting with audience are a little barren.I hope you have the same bloke as us on your Walking Tour."
Great tour of a beautiful building,Informative and interesting. Saw several theatres . Guide was lovely and knew much about ttthe venue.
Iconic,We sailed into Sydney Harbour and was greeted by the awesome opera House. When we had a walk there one night on close inspection we found it to be very concrete looking and showing it's age. There are nice bars and restaurants to eat by the harbour. It's a must see but in my opinion a little disappointing close up.
Excellent tour  of this Iconic building.,We were so impressed with the building we decided to book a tour and were pleased we did it was so good to see the inside and learn about this globally recognised building.As all events had been cancelled when we were in Sydney the tour was the only way to see inside. The guide was excellent and definitely recommend this entertaining and informative tour if visiting Sydney.
Must read the construction history about it!,"We only visited the outside and around areas and found it a marvelous architectural building.  The serenity of the location at the bay location is perfect. At night, it even locks better.  The public bathrooms are a must visit."
Lovely city and residents,"The Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge alone are fantastic to visit, but there's so much more to Sydney. However don't miss the tour of the Opera House to get a real view of this fantastic structure. And if you're daring and have plenty of money to spare, try the Harbor Bridge climb to the top for an incredible view of the area. The very walkable downtown area is lovely. Other terrific places to visit include The Queen Victoria Building which is a lovely mall inside this historic building. For more shopping there are other places too like the Westfield Mall. The Darling Harbor area is another not to miss. Several tourist attractions are located around the scenic harbor. Hyde park offers some tranquil spaces right in the city. Besides different churches, don't miss St. Mary's Cathedral, it's worth a visit. Sydney offers a lovely mix of classic buildings and totally modern ones. They recently installed electric modern trams throughout the downtown. Did I mention how friendly the residents are?"
Do not miss the symbol of Australia,"Walk around and discover the Sydney Opera House from different angles. Do not forget to take the ferry and take photos from the water side. The ""sails"" of the Opera are amazing!"
Such a mind blowing experience!,"We had no idea what to expect coming into this tour and have to say it was money well spent! I moved to Sydney from California 3 years ago and my mom came out to visit for the first time, we did this tour before seeing an opera that night. This tour absolutely made the experience! Our guide, Tom, was so passionate and full of information about the opera house and opera in general. We got to see the props they used that night, even walked on the stage and through the orchestra pits. Just an incredible experience for anyone interested in the Sydney Opera House. Make sure to ask for Tom when you book this tour, he really made it special!"
Dream come true ,Always wanted to visit Sydney and the opera house.. Didn‚Äôt disappoint.. It is a truly magical place and 100% worth the visit! Definitely worth doing the harbour cruise also as you can see it from different angles!
Iconic building with an interesting history,"Everyone knows the iconic SOH from the outside but it is quite different on the inside. Definitely recommend a guided tour to understand how the SOH was created (design, funding, fabrication, etc.). Our tour guide was very knowledgable and insightful. The inside is very contemporary and smaller than I expected. Many design vs. functionality trade-off that are evident from the inside. We tried to see Six while we were in town but unfortunately it was sold out."
Interesting Tour,"The tour lasted about 2 hours and was interesting to see the various concert halls and rooms. Most interesting to me were the ceilings, roof, and the discussion about the original architect. I really liked the wood ceilings - made of various types of wood - great craftsmanship. The roof was made of tiles imported from Sweden- surprise, surprise, the first architect was Swedish!! The original architect was Swedish and was fired after a few years by a recently hired minister and replaced by Australian architects. I will bet that this was a political move (hmmmmmmmm) and resulted in some, if not most, of the huge cost-overrun,and  long construction time. I wish that I would have asked our guide how close the current opera house is to the Swedish architect's original interior and exterior designs. Word to the wise - get to the opera house early since you cannot make an advance reservation for a tour time. We got there about 11 am and the earliest tour time available was 4 PM. Se we had to each lunch and consume a number of brews before our tour start."
Enjoyable Tour,"I really enjoyed the tour of the Opera House. It was great to find out the history about it and I found the story behind the construction really interesting. The main auditorium was under construction but got to see the Opera hall. The tour itself convinced me to book into a show which I absolutely loved. I would definitely recommend the tour, it puts so much more context behind the numerous photos you will inevitably take standing in front of it."
Excellent tour!,"We loved our tour of the Sydney Opera House.  Alex could not have been a better guide.  We are sure he has been a guide numerous times but his passion for the building and theatre in general made the tour ""live"".  We were able to see all the ""tour"" theatres as we were fortunate enough to visit when there were no rehearsals or performances.  We would highly recommend this tour."
One woman show.  Wow.,"We had to see a show at the Sydney Opera House while in Sydney.  We chose, ""Songs for Nobodies.""  What a talent!"
Opera house tour,Visited the opera House for a tour. Interesting and highly recommended. It‚Äôs huge and I can see how they run everything.
Hamlet at Sydney playhouse,Seeing a play at the Sydney opera House complex with a dinner beforehand was a great experience and worked wellThe food in the restaurant good standard a bit pricey although the ambiance a bit basic hidden away in a corner very near the corridor of where the box office I'd situatedThe performance in the 350 or soa modern setting and pretty big standard auditoriumPerformance modern with hamlet played by a woman fine but not outstandingOverall a good night outFor a first night at the opera good to do but not fantastic
A Wonderful Tour,Our tour of the opera house focused on the architecture and history of this iconic building. It was so fun and informative! Loved it!
"Interesting, but not exciting","When you stand anywhere outside, the Sydney Opera House is indeed spectacular.  We took the tour - a little slow, a little bland, but still worthwhile.  Seeing the actual performance halls is nice.  Getting up close to the amazing structure is wonderful.  No fireworks, a little pricey, but we believe it was time and money well spent"
Guide not interested,"The guide gave a boring unenthusiastic tour. The orchestra hall was closed for repairs and the major message in the other halls was: ""Don't take pictures."" Not worth the money except that it goes to a good cause."
Iconic Sydney views for free,"Accessible by rail and bus from all over Sydney. Bus to Wynyard or Town Hall, and or train to Circular Quay. Million dollar views surround you from the forecourt to across the harbour. The manic face of Luna Park taunts you to venture the ferry to Milson's Point, or the Northern Pylons and Kirribilli where you can lose yourself in flowering lilac Jacarandas of McDougall St. The Sydney Botanical Gardens are adjacent, featuring marvellous displays of so many genus of plants.The white ""sails"" beckon you to dream of past and future sea voyages. If lucky enough, January is when Sydney  goes into overdrive with festivals ongoing to Late Easter.For the diehards, do an Opera House tour for the behind the scenes lo down."
Learn the History of the Opera and Enjoy a Good Meal,"We did the Sydney Opera House Tour and Dine right afer we left the zoo.  We walked the short distance from the ferry to the Opera House where we took the tour, which lasted a little over an hour. The guide we had was a walking encyclopedia of information on the Opera House. The many years it took to build, the different architects, the amazing renovactions (that are still in progress). We visited the many theatres and studios, and watched while they were in the process of setting up one of the stages for an upcoming perfformance.  All in all a very intersting experience topped off with a meal at the Opera house Bar.  You choose one of three meals offered after the tour. Drinks are extra.  The  Opera House Bar is a lively place with inside or outside seating right on the harbor."
Not to be missed,"Tours are very interesting including the history of how it got built (slight overrun over original budget, about 14 times).  Be prepared to climb a lot of steps!  Also try to see a show there, tour ticket includes discount.  Area around there includes a number of cafe/restaurants."
Wonderful building with great shows,"Obviously a must do in Sydney, no other building like it in the world.But apart from its beauty and grandeur, it also has wonderful shows. I normally prefer the smaller more intimate shows in the Drama theatre or the Studio but Rock the House in the Concert Hall was irresistible.So many top performers from the 60's, they were having so much fun they had to be dragged from the stage.My only problem was that with the Hall being so big, my seat was way back and I missed the connection and emotion I normally enjoy."
"Iconic, crowded",Truly iconic in the Sydney harbour. Seen the opera house countless times but i'm still amazed by it everytime. There's always a crowd around here. The pub nearby has great vibes so do check that out.
Lovely walk,Great walk to the  iconic Sydney Opera House. Lots to see and do at Circular Quay. Plus feeling the anticipation leading up to the Iconic Sydney Opera House is worthwhile.
World class tour for a world class building,"Thank you Peter for such an enjoyable and engaging tour! We were thoroughly entertained by Peter's extensive knowledge of anything Sydney Opera House.What an asset he is!We viewed three spaces and some foyers and we were regaled with stories about the history of the Sydney Opera House, it's architectural features, current and upcoming shows, politics and controversy over Utzon's departure, humorous anecdotes, and we were very impressed that he actually worked with Peter Hall, the architect who took over from Utzon. How authentic is that!! We highly recommend this tour for not only tourists but locals who are interested in one of our architectural icons."
Truly Stunning!!!,Everyone says Wow! And it really is Wow!Stunning out and in!Tip....stop taking pictures and let your eyeballs feast!In daylight and nighttime a hive of activity....make sure you do both. The tour is very good and informative and can be combined with a great meal outside for a fab price....super steak!Right now make sure you see ‚ÄòSix‚Äô fabulous show...amazing singers and vibe!
Stewart Hall,Well worth seeing behind the scenes. Very good. Except it was a pity on the restrictions to be able to take some fotos
"Under construction, but still a must-see","We visited the Opera House when the main auditorium was undergoing renovations. While we didn't get to see the largest venue, the tour was hardly diminished in our view. We still got to see all the other halls, learn about the construction of the Opera House, and get up-close and personal with the beautiful sails. For a great price and short duration, I think it is an easy activity to incorporate into nearly any holiday  to Sydney."
Sooo interesting,A great way to see and hear about how the Sydney Opera house evolved and was built. - well worth it. We got to go in a number of the theatres and even back stage
The tour of the opera,Well it is not worth the tour it is over priced and not worth it 73 dollars for two..if you would have gone to a show thee you would have seen more
Very Beautiful ,"Yes, we were doing everything touristy but in the most non-touristy way so that when we go.there the next time, we can do the non-touristy thing üòù. And how couldn't we see the Sydney Opera House It was amazing but all under locks, and the promised light show with a theme dedicated to Aboriginal Art never happened (we waited for an hour with the hope it will happen as promised on their website) and that is why a star less"
Beautiful as expected,"The Sydney opera house is just a must see in Sydney, and it really doesn't disappoint. You don't have to pay to get inside, but they do tours. We chose to go and see a play which was really a great experience too! I would highly recommend doing that"
Stunning,"Couldn‚Äôt believe I was actually there, I was in awe to see how amazing the Opera House is - stunning.Everywhere is clean. Easy access to the Botanical Gardens"
Totally worth it ,"The Opera House exceeded all my expectations. I highly recommend taking a tour and seeing a show. It is so spectacular inside and the shows, regardless of what you go to is top notch. Be sure to get a view from the harbour on a ferry and from the bridge!"
Review of opera house,"The iconic Opera house looks beautiful during the day or at night. it has a various plays/musicals inside it during the week, check the website for ongoing plays or shows. The harbor along has many restaurant/cafes/bars bustling with people. A great place to visit, eat and get pictures with the backdrop of the Opera house or the Bridge."
Amazing building.,The tour of the Opera house allows you to get close to the design and history and construction of the building. It was interesting to see the various spaces within the building but more interesting was the details regarding the construction. A must visit when in Sydney.
Iconic building,Loved visiting sydney opera house. Beautifully designed building and good bar/ restaurant overlooking the harbour. Would love to visit again some day.
Wonderful Experience,"We visited Sydney for 3 days this month on the way back from visiting our grown up children in NZ. My wife loves opera and we were fortunate to get tickets for her favourite opera Carmen at a very reasonable price.  We also had the pre performance picnic with Charcuterie , cheese and bubbly which was a nice extra. The whole experience was wonderful, albeit the audience were a little more indisciplined than you would normally expect and there was some annoying talking during the performance. Notwithstanding, it was a truly great experience and one not to forget. The setting of the opera house is stunning and the building itself deserves its iconic status. Overall a night to remember."
Best hits of Opera,"Attended the Sydney Opera house best hits of Opera this past Sunday night and all i have to say is that they should stick to signing Opera in English.Many of the songs from Carmen were sang in French and being French Canadian, I could not understand the words being sang!The 4 Opera signers should probably spend some time learning to speak french first then sing the words with correct pronunciation ."
Great harbour views,"I haven't been inside the opera house for many years, but I can certainly recommend that you walk all the way around the outside of the opera house as the views of the harbour and bridge from the back (or is it the front ?) are fantastic."
Iconic,"How could you go to Sydney and not see an opera at the Sydney Opera House, I ask you. We chose to see Don Giovanni at the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the opera house. The venue was outstanding and our seats were perfect, yes pricey but worth every cent. You were able to see the translations above the stage which would help you understand what is going on but honestly you should read up on whatever opera you are seeing to have some idea of the story. Beautifully done, sets magnificent and performers wonderful. A great evening even if my husband and my friends husband dozed off a couple of times, yes that does happen!"
Opera house tour with dinner,Great way to see behind the scenes of the Opera House. You can finish it off with an awesome meal at Billabong restaurant located right there.
Great package at a stunning location,"While in Sydney recently, we arranged a ""tour package"" at the famed Sydney Opera House.  This started with a late afternoon tour of the Opera House, visiting several of the performing venues, backstage areas and public concourses with a thorough presentation on the design and building process.  The Opera House is an iconic building which truly merits the praise it has received.  After the very interesting tour, we had dinner at the Opera Bar with a choice of three possible dishes.  We each had the steak which was excellent, even if it wasn't one of the prime cuts of beef.  OUr package concluded with tickets to a performance.  They have operas on a rotational basis every night they're open, but they also have other types of shows.  We chose to have tickets for the musical ""Six"" which is about the six wives of Henry VII, though it uses very contemporary music to have each wife present their story.  I had seen this show in London, England a year previously but my wife hadn't and I thought she would enjoy it.  The production in Sydney was possibly even better than the one I had seen in London's West End.  Overall this was a great visit and one I would heartily recommend to anyone visiting Sydney."
Good viewpoint,"Good to see in real size, so many pictures make it look huge, but in reality it's not that big.Defo worth a visit"
Great walk from Circular Quay,"Ideal location, unique design, well worth visiting when in Sydney. Relaxing walk from Circular Quay with plenty of cafes and bars to drop into on way there or back."
Picturesque setting,Only walked around and took in the architecture and view of this place. Has a great view of the harbour. Good photographic setting. Lots of steps to the entrance. Not everyone in our group wanted to go inside for the tour. But was pricey. very hard looking as not much foliage to soften the exterior walking area. Didn't realise how large it was until walking around the whole building!
The Real Story,Fascinating tour of the Opera House with even more fascinating details about its history. A definite must do while in Sydney. And they even take the price of the tour off concert tickets. Got to see Atilla for almost half price.
A night at the opera ,We seen Carmen - fantastic music and performance although I struggled with the modern setting. The opera house is amazing from the outside and is quite awe inspiring. The auditorium is beautifully finished and comfortable. The foyer is a bit unfinished with concrete beams .Overall it's a must see on your visit to Sydney
Superb,"This is a must and I highly recommend the small group of tour (8) versus the large tours. Our guide, Darryl I think, had a dry wit and was very entertaining. He knew the answer to every question asked, even technical questions about hydraulics. The architecture is fascinating. Highly recommend. You can‚Äôt appreciate this wonder without a tour. I inadvertently signed up for the tasting lunch and it was superb, although too much food."
An Amazing Architectural Monument!,"I always wanted to visit because I've seen the iconic photos my whole life.  But, let me tell you - going inside and truly viewing the splendor of this building is worth it.   Sitting in the various concert halls and listening to the acoustics and visual impact of each was fantastic."
Better than expected,"I expected to be underwhelmed by the Sydney Opera House as is often the case with large, famous monuments, but not the case with the opera house. Great for pictures and very central to other sights and activities."
Guided Tour of Sydney Opera House,"A fascinating guided tour of the Sydney Opera House. It helps to have a tour guide like the incredibly passionate and animated Michael. He really does know his stuff, and his pronunciations of the various opera shows added to this must do tour. A really enjoyable and interesting insight."
Sydney Opera. ,I never tire of visiting the Sydney Opera House. This time we saw Carmen. This production had a more modern setting than the original which somehow worked.
A delightful place ,"Incredible building and as always a very pleasurable experience in the bar at Benelong. Attentive staff, good cocktails and wine list and delicious small plates."
Sydney Opera Production of Faust,Superb production. The sets and costumes were amazing. The singing was extraordinary. A lovely memorable evening!  Worth attending.
Sydney Highlight,We did a tour of the Opera House and would highly recommend it. It was wonderful to see the different venues and to learn about the constructions and what make it unique.
Great Theatre,"I went to The Opera House to see a stage play, it is a really great place. I sat outside to eat dinner and watch the boats and ships in the harbour., i had a fantastic view of the Harbour Bridge. The theatre was not too big and the seats were comfortable. I would recommend that you see a show here."
Great Outings!,We walked up to the Opera House box office to get a sense of what was available and we bought tickets for the next guided tour and the play that evening.  We truly enjoyed both experiences. Peter was an exceptional guide; as an architect he provided numerous insights during our tour and was helpful with our questions.  We were impressed that the various venues pay homage to the indigenous peoples whose land provides the foundation for the Opera House.  We also enjoyed the play that evening.
Construction,We booked ticket for the opera on our arrival day in Sydney. What a disappointment to see that it was in a second hall. we had a nice time and it is very impressive to see it live. Arrive early for a drink at the lobby bar surrounding the bay.
Check out a show,"Ok, I‚Äôm going to give you some free advice. If you really want the best out of your experience at the opera house, go and book yourself into see a show. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be something that you are really into, but it gives you a much better appreciation for the building.Such great history. An iconic building that I can now tick off my bucket list."
Sydney Opera House,Very interesting tour of the inside of the Opera House from a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. Only downside is that the main hall is currently closed for renovation and will remain so for around two years
ICONIC,"This iconic building, stands out in this huge harbour, leading up to it there are a smattering of bars and restaurants.Inside there‚Äôs a gift shop and other restaurants and bars.Great place for concerts of all types and a superb place for photos."
Beautiful,So much to do and see in Sydney. Walking cross the bridge is it gay great way to see the opera house and Sydney itself plus you could either bungee jump off the bridge or walk to the top on a tour. Plenty of places to eat around the harbor and a few blocks in.
Sydney area.,"What a fabulous place to visit. Not cheap anymore. Plenty to see and do and very safe. I loved the place been twice. It`s a different world to where we live in the UK. 22hr flight if you're lucky.If you have the time and money, get your self out there."
Great place,"Great place to visit, there are my bars, restaurants and souvenir shops near the area. outside there is free wifi. you can book directly there if you want to participate in any show."
40th vday,Great cultural experience with all the drama a building the opera House. Our tour guide Sue did not disappoint.
Remarkable building,"Our guide took us to the inside public places, and outside where we could look at the exterior tiles up close.  We couldn‚Äôt go backstage, because a rehearsal was taking place.  But we got to watch a little of the rehearsal, which was fun.  She gave us the history of how the architect was selected, not supported, and badly treated overall.  Fascinating!"
Inspiring architecture,"We spent a good amount of time walking inside and mostly outside the opera house.  Having seen this iconic structure so many times in photos, it still took my breath away in person.  At every turn, the spectacular architecture presented itself for photo opportunities. We didn't do the tour as the times did not fit our schedule. There are also restaurants/bars along the harborside to relax and take in the  beautiful skyline."
"9am tour, great start to a day in Sydney","We had Julia as our guide, she was excellent very knowledgeable and answered so many questions from the group. We saw 2 of the theatres, unfortunately we could not see the main theatre as it was being renovated. It was a very interesting tour."
A must do but depends on your guide! ,"This was a bucket list trip, but the main hall is closed for refurbishment (although you do get a sneak peak!) and our guide could have been more engaging and not just going through the motions. There are not a huge amount of steps once you start the tour so suitable for all abilities. There is a light display on the sails that cover the restaurant at sunset and a few further times in the evening. These are not well advertised but worth seeing. Would love to visit when they have a display over the whole of the building! Overall a must but like all trips depends on the guide you get."
45 minute expedited tour,"Well done in the short amount of time that the guide head. We were unable to see the large venue as they were rehearsing, but we are going to the opera Carmen on Tuesday night so will definitely get a great view of the large opera venue then"
Incredible iconic building,"Go before sunset to experience the full majesty of the building and surrounds- for the active walk through the botanical gardens, or from the quay! see a show but if you are a tourist remember to be quiet during performances!"
Great Tour of the Opera House,We booked a tour of the Opera House through Viator.  Our guide was most knowledgeable and presented the information in an interesting way. I highly recommend this tour.
Iconic place of Australia.,Iconic place of Australia. Very interesting guided tour of the interior. The only downside is that the large performance hall is currently closed for renovation and we had not been told.
Wonderful Iconic place to visit,"Very clean surroundings. People were also supper friendly and helpful. Absolutely free of charge. Would have wanted to actuly watcha show at the opera house, but we didn't have time."
Interesting visit to this iconic and beautiful building,Met promptly by the guide who gave out superior headphones and tested everyone could hear. Guide was extremely knowledgable and the information was interesting and entertaining.  We went outside to look at ‚Äòthe sails‚Äô and learnt about the architect who won the job to design the building. The attention to detail in the design to attain the best possible acoustics was fascinating. We went into two of the three theatres and into two concert halls.  The guide encouraged us to ask questions and fluently responded. We saw the sets on the stages and some of the costumes.Afterwards we went to the Opera bar where we had voucher for lunch.  I was expecting a sandwich or tasting palate but we were offered a decent menu to choose from. I had an Angus steak with potatoes and fresh vegetables and my husband had fish and chips.  Both meals were delicious and eaten outside in beautiful surroundings.  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Absolutely top-of-the-world class,"It's been my pleasure to attend performances in nearly all of the many venues in this beautiful building. Each of the venues is perfect-for-purpose and supported by excellent catering...and, of course, surrounded by dramatic architecture with magnificent views of Sydney Harbour.  Anything you attend here will be a memorable event."
Good experience,Very knowledgeable @ experienced guide. Good pace & relevant information making it a very enjoyable experience.
Opera Bar,"Took our overseas visitors to the Opera Bar for some wonderful photo shoots, can‚Äôt beat it Harbour Bridge as a beautiful backdrop And sitting in the shade of the Opera Bar Perfect tourist destination"
Excellent venue,"February opera was well done and view from seat was great. Opera house easy to get to, area very walkable."
Best views,Amazing icon and this is the best location for Sydney harbour views. The bar at the opera is great with happy hour. Food is average and pricey. Avoid Fridays as locals head down there for friday drinks.
Icon to see.,"Beautiful sight. Quite a walk for seniors but well worth it. Lots of eating places and very good photos,lots of steps."
Wow,"After years of seeing the opera house on the tv, I was taken back from seeing it close. There‚Äôs a great atmosphere around the opera house and recommend going on a tour inside"
Fascinating tour,The hour long tour of the opera house is excellent.  The guides are well informed and the history is really worth hearing.  This is a do not miss while in Sydney and puts you near so many other fun things to do.
Sydney Opera House,This place is even more amazing up close. The structure itself and the view from all angles are definitely worth taking the time to look at.
Iconic,Do I need to explain why this is a must!?An excellent venue. Walk around it and take pictures from all angles. OR...cross the bridge and check it out from North Sydney. AWESOME view!
Opera House,"Great for picture taking of the Opera House, selfies and of the harbour and the ionic Sydney Harbor Bridge.  The Opera House has a restaurant, offers guided walking tours and sells tickets to a wide array of entertainment daily.  There is a small gift shop and a free public toilets."
Saved a Rainy Day in Sydney,"We had a great time walking around the Opera House one day and then taking their guided tour another day when it was raining. Our tour guide was very knowledgable about the Opera House and had several fun facts that made the tour very enjoyable. I didn't think the tour would be necessary initially, but I learned a lot and really enjoyed learning more about the history of how it was built. It's touristy, but definitely a must-do when visiting Sydney. We also caught one of the smaller comedies that was playing, and it was very cool to actually see a show there (even though it wasn't opera)."
Guiided tour,the only way to see this beautiful structure. Hotel concierge helped buy tickets ahead online.They have several restaurants along the East side of the House. Both sheltered and outside seating. Everything from a pint to a full meal.
Beautiful Opera House,"If you have the time, try to take in an opera. The production of La Boheme was outstanding. Enjoy the Opera Bar before and after your show. Magnificent!"
Lived up to high expectations,"Amazing building inside and out. Great organisation and ticketing.  Although a full house when we visited we still found plenty of space for interval drinks (and even a good sandwich, much needed on a late arrival into Sydney from the bush).Comfortable seats too!"
Back room tour,1 hour tour.  Disappointing as the main concert hall was closed for refurbishment.  Turned out of the studio as soon as we went in as a rehearsal was to take place.  Had to miss one area as the 20:20 ladies cricket event was taking place in the venue.  Overall not a great visit
"Outside great, inside nothing special",Our tour of the Opera House was worthless.  Interior was nothing special and many stages were under renovation.  Stick with the free exterior.
Global Icon,"Even though we live in Sydney we wanted to share our view on one of the world‚Äôs most iconic sites - The Sydney Opera House. Set against the backdrop of one of the world‚Äôs most iconic harbours, the Opera House is a must visit for anybody coming to Sydney. The Opera House car park located underground is surprisingly well priced for it‚Äôs location and has easy  access to the Opera House. After pictures and a walk around the Opera House one can walk through the botanical gardens (next to it), see NSW government house and make their way around to Woolloomooloo whatf where some of the cities best restaurants are located on the harbour."
"Im always excited to see this place, and im here often. Great place to get some very good photos and lots to do here","Im always excited to see this place, and im here often. Great place to get some very good photos and lots to do around this area. Its also a great place to get some excercise and stop and enjoy the sights."
Comedy theatre and tour,"Having done one of the tours, which was brilliant for seeing everywhere and gaining some insight to the history of it.  We then booked for a comedy which of course had an Aussie spin to it all.  We laughed most of the way through it.  We only booked the day before and prices were good.  There are about 12 different theatres there so offer a wide range of all the arts.  Even the day before we had the choice of 5 different theatres.  A must do and thoroughly enjoyable. The restaurant and bar area along the front makes it all a lovely atmosphere."
Interesting but expensive tour,"An interesting tour but disappointed that we had to check in our small backpacks (don't forget to come back immediately to collect your bags as we are closing), expensive tour photos, and the inability to take photos in some areas (for copyright reasons regarding stage settings!)."
A Can‚Äôt Miss,The tour of the Opera House was very informative.  It took one hour.  Our guide was very good.  We even saw sound and music checks for the live performance they were having that night.  Several people went back at night with discounted tickets to see the show.
Sitting on Bennelong Point and being listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Site List,"If possible try and attend a function in one of the rooms at the Opera House. Sydney Symphony performs regularly at Utzon Room. So many records, good and not so good were broken in building the Opera House, many lessons learned. For example, original cost estimate was $7m but it ended up costing over $100m. Over half a century later it now seems like a very good low cost investment. Difficult to imagine Sydney Harbour without the Opera House."
What a Structure!,"Thoroughly enjoyed this guided tour. The story of its design and construction over many years was very interesting.  Political intervention, firing the architect, engineering marvel, major cost overruns ($7 mil budget with final costs of plus $100 mil) all resulting in a magnificent iconic cultural center for Sydney.  Great tour."
Opera Australia Don Giovanni,Great night at the Dame Joan Sutherland Theatre and had dinner at Overture Dining Excellent production and acoustics
Never fails to please,"I really like the vibe at the harbour. It was winter, so not many tourists. East to get a great selfie with the harbour bridge and opera house in the same shot. I got a tea at the cafe, it wasn't so expensive. Walk around the whole building. Take it in. It is wondrous."
Six,"We had a great time.  Six isn't your ordinary musical with a story line.  This is about the 6 wives if Henry VII all vieing for top spot as queen.  Music is fun, upbeat, and humorous."
Love it !,"The Sydne Opera House never disapoints. It has to be a bucket list to see a performance in the Concert Hall(currently being renovated I think ?) Sunset drinks at the opera bar is another must do, the views of Circular Quay and the Mighty Harbour Bridge are breathtaking !"
Well worth the trip!!,What a fantastic way to spend a part of your day in our city. The walk around is relaxing and very scenic.
Site to see,"We were only visiting for 2 days via a cruise.did a guided tour of the opera house,very enjoyable with great insights to parts unavailable to a solo tour"
Excellent tour of the Sydney Opera House Backstage,I was given a gift voucher to undertake this tour and I admit I was not overly interested in taking the tour.  I was however extremely surprised how interesting the tour was.  The tour guide was very informative and the hour tour was a great experience that I would highly recommend.
Great Building,"Sydney Opera House is the icon of Sydney. Whenever you travel, even though it might not be the first time. It's great to go and walk around during the day or night."
Sydney Opera House Tour is a Must Do,Seeing the stunning Sydney Opera House from the outside is impressive but it is not enough. The walking tour is well worth the cost. Our guide was knowledgeable of all details of the amazing building. The tour is done with audio headphones  so  you don‚Äôt miss anything. A true highlight of any visit to this beautiful city.
In and about the Opera House,Really interesting architectural history there. Almost all the who is who of performers have been here.The food choices in and around the opera house are simply huge and cater to every taste and pocket.Choose a table with a view you like....
Very informative,"The Opera House is the pinnacle of Sydney.  We enjoyed the tour, allowing us to learn its history and view its many theatres.  Even better is going to a performance.  We saw ‚ÄúCarmen‚Äù and it was incredible.  The sight lines and acoustics are superb."
Very Informative Tour,"This tour moved at a great pace and kept our interest throughout the whole tour.  We learned many new and interesting things about the history and current use of the Opera House and had adequate time to ask questions and take photos.  My teens loved that they got to touch the roof of the opera house.  Our tour guide, Jason, did an excellent job."
Went to an opera - an all-round amazing experience,"Spent a few days in Sydney on my first ever trip to Australia and rather than go on one of the walking tours around the Opera House we decided to go to see an actual opera in the Dame Joan Sutherland Theatre:  Carmen was a spectacular production and the whole evening was seriously enjoyable. The building, from whichever way you look at it, is awesome: inside, outside, from a ferry, from across the quay, from the air!  On the night we were there, the Opera House's tribute to the firefighters working against the bush fires (see photo) was particularly moving. I now wished I'd gone on one of the walking tours to learn more first hand. Next time."
Excellent tour,"Had a wonderful tour of the Sydney Opera House yesterday, it‚Äôs worth considering a very early tour as they tend to be smaller, and less crowded.    The tour was very informative, and we were able to see all of the smaller venues within the opera house.  Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask difficult challenging questions; your guide will know the answers and will enjoy being challenged.  Well worth a visit for a few hours."
Do the guided tour,"The guided tours are led by incredibly knowledgeable, amiable and friendly guides and you really get to see both behind the scenes and the incredible architecture close-up."
Tour is very fun and you might get lucky,"Only reason for 4 stars is the audio equipment needs to be tested some of the headphones and devices do not work, plus you are not allowed to takes pics of any of the auditoriums. Because they want to sell you a green screen pic. Otherwise the tour is super informative  and really neat. I would suggest taking an early tour 10am or 11 as you may get to see rehersals in all auditoriums. But you do get to learn some history and see some areas you wouldnt."
Walking tour,Guide excellent. Building fantastic. Very good information and great views. Wish we had time for an opera
Very Interesting building,The Sydney Opera house is at the Harbour. Book a Tour to learn about the history & architecture. Many theatres & shows - a visit is highly recommended
Awesome,A must see if you are in Sydney.  A tour of this iconic building is well worth the time.  The guide was very informative and we gained insight into the history of the building as well as the process of ongoing maintenance to this World Heritage site.
Iconic building is a must see/do experience,"We had a three part experience. First was a VIP tour of some of the 5+ performance halls ranging from the 2,500 seat capacity Concert Hall for the Sydney Symphony to the much smaller venues that are used for business meetings, comedy shows and drama. The history of the building as the political influence was also fascinating. Second was the dinner at the Bennelong. The food and wine pairings were good but I have to say the menu was geared at the serious foodie group. Third act was the opera itself (Carmen) which was amazing. I‚Äôm not a big opera fan but figured it was a once in a lifetime experience that I wasn‚Äôt going to miss. The tidbit that doesn‚Äôt get much advertisement is the light show on the smaller building every night at sunset, 9, 9:30 and 10. It was an a,a zing display of aboriginal art and accompanying music. Definitely worth checking out."
Beautiful Opera House and amazing architecture,We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the inside of the main Opera House and walking around the various areas of the Opera House area.
Priceless!,Difficult to describe the experience of taking a tour and seeing uo close an icon...most adjectives fail...our guide whose first language was perhaps French described it as 'worthless' when asked for how much would it cost today but quickly corrected herself and said 'priceless'
Good tour but not able to view main concert hall,Good tour but main concert hall not open.  Still worth doing but informed about the main hall not being open.  Great tour guide.  Very interesting and knowledgeable.
A Lasting Icon,"It is hard to find more of a true global icon - the opera house defines the Sydney city-scape. A true pleasure to see in person for the 2nd time, it is architecturally amazing and just laying eyes on it can take your breath away! We did not have time for a tour or anything of the such, but having previously seen a show inside one of the performance halls, a peek in is well worth it!"
Beautiful place,Every time I come to Sydney. Opera house is always on my list to visit. I never get sick of looking at it.Highly recommended to anyone.
"'Beautiful Architecture  Building""","Nice place to hang around at this beautiful Opera House whether it is day or night.  There are many tourists came here as other attractions like the Royal Botanic Garden, Circular Quay and Central Business District are nearby."
Don‚Äôt miss the Sydney Selfie when your there,"On the left side of the steps to the Opera house if you‚Äôre lucky you may see a standee and some crew wearing blue shirts with Sydney Selfie printed on it. You will be asked to stand at a designated spot and look up at the top of the mast where a camera is located. A countdown from 10, and then you strike a pose at 3. You are then given a card with a link where you can view the selfie. The picture focuses on you then zooms out to space and back again. Spectacular. The Selfie itself is free to view, but you can download an HD version for AUD 6.75"
Mardi Gras 2020,"We went to see ‚ÄòSix‚Äô at the Sydney Opera House! OMG! FANTASTIC! Excellent seats, excellent story line, excellent cast! Even better than I thought it would be!"
Brilliant tour,Absolutely brilliant tour with very knowledgeable tour guide. Good quality headsets so you never miss out on anything. So much info about our beautiful icon. Special video as well. Enjoyed it all. The platter afterwards of hot and cold food was so very plentiful. There is also the opportunity to purchase great photos as photographer on site. Also well worth the experience.
Amazing Sydney Opera House,Sydney Opera House takes tour breath away! Such an amazing landmark and vision. We took the walk around tour which was very interesting and were very lucky to take a wonderful cruise starting and ending out of Sydney Harbour with amazing views of the Opera House and Bridge.
Must see if you are in Sydney,"The Opera House is one of the best known icons in the world.  The tour was very interesting, visiting all of the various theater venues, and a good look into the history of the construction of the building."
Spectacular Sydney Opera house,"A great tour, well organised and worth the visit.  Highly recommend taking the time to explore. Easy to book, staff were knowledgeable on all queries of the group.."
Fabulous to experience from the inside too!,"The iconic Sydney Opera House is amazing in it‚Äôs unique design, and graceful setting! A must see inside and out.  I saw the opera Carmen to experience the fabulous acoustics! Think the inside is as majestic as the outside of the building.  Good eats and drinks at the Opera bar below!  As a side note, thanks to the manger Roberto for helping me out with a phone emergency I had!  So kind and accommodating!  And do see the Opera House iby day and night!"
Inside the opera house,"If you're in Sydney you should go on a tour of the opera house. It's a beautiful building inside and out with a really interesting story behind it. Also don't miss the free light show on the outside wall every night at 8pm, 9pm and 10pm."
Excellent.,"A birthday present for my husband and myself, a tour and a sampler lunch,a great tour very informative, they take your photo before the tour and it is super imposed on several pictures and put in an album, a great keepsake. The sampler lunch was more than enough for 2. Would recommend."
"Very impresive landmark, iconic buiding","A monumental architectural work of the 20th century, Opera House is one of the busiest performing arts centres in the world.INTERESTING FACTS: - its Air-Con uses Sea Water; - there are 1,000 different rooms inside; - the doors were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on the 20th October 1973"
Inside the Sydney Opera House,"We were in Sydney 5 years ago. We didn't go into the Opera House then. We decided that we would do the tour this year. We did booked it thru Viator. Not sure if it is more expensive or less directly thru the Opera House. Either way, the Opera House personnel are the ones that lead the tour. We got there early and they took us early. Nice to see the inside. We went into multiple venues. I wouldn't plan my whole time in Sydney around this trip, but it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours if you are looking for something to do. We were waiting to get on our cruise ship. I think it was about 90 minutes."
Amazing,A visit to the Opera House is a must when in Sydney as one can admire the wonders of its architectural structure. Well worth it!!
Opera House Tour is Worthwhile,"Very good behind the scenes tour in a small group. Headsets make it easy to hear commentary. Many opportunities for great photos, except in theaters where sets are present."
Iconic,"We spent 5 days in Sydney and walked to the Opera House every day. It never failed to fascinate. We did a tour, which was excellent and well worth the money. Lots of facts and insights to be gained on the tour. We viewed it from every angle, from the Harbour Bridge, from a ferry and from various viewpoints."
Great Opera House Tour!,Very informative tour-our guide was excellent and covered a lot in a short period of time!  It is worth spending an hour to learn the history behind this beautiful architectural wonder!
Best way to see it is by a performance; check for last-minute tickets.,"Much as been written about this superlative place. Let me add that the best way to see the Opera House is by taking in a performance. (FYI, tickets purchased on-line or at the box office incur the same $8 service charge per transaction.) Tickets are often available for same-day performances. If you visit the Opera House ticket office on the ground level, stop first at the ""Information"" desk to see if there are any same-day, last-minute discounts. Doors seem to open an hour before the show, so get there early for coffee or drinks at one of the cafe-bars and for unobstructed photography from the terrace, and join in as people pass to each other their cameras to get memorable shots of their group."
Opera House,The Opera House tour is a must when visiting Sydney.  Interesting and only about an hour and that works well.
Amazing!,Definitely go on the tour of the opera house.  You are able to see the 6 venues within the structure.  This is truly an architectural masterpiece!
Carmen,Saw Carmen one night & Six the next night.Can‚Äôt get enough of Sydney Opera House!Bravo! Enjoyed the light show outside the Opera House. So nice to just sit out & soak in the harbor views before & after the shows.
Iconic and must see,It is good to wander around the opera theatre but even better to go and see a show. You can wander around but there are paid tours which we did not do.
"Known on Australia, and Australia is known by","Opera house in Sydney was always on the list of these things I must see before I die, and I do it, and it deserves, simply wow wow. A piece of art that was beyond its foundation era, it's like a spaceship comes from far skies, and landed perfectly on Sydney. Frankly saying, I get shocked from the amount of negligence and lack of maintainance happens to it's body, i.e. cladding and facade. It gets yellowish by the time seems and has dirty old signs as you can see in pictures. Stairs and cement parts don't get better even. Please guys and authorities raise your attention to this architectural equity known for Australia and Australia is known for, replace, paint and touches from time to time look always healthy and young as you are."
More than wonderful,"Experienced Carmen. Blown away by the human factor of the opera house. Perfection. Not saying more, spend your money on the best seats you can."
night at the opera,"watched an opera, bar prices decent, performance was really good, inside the thearte its not as spectacular as other venues but a worthwhile exsperiance. only downside was ushers letting late people in."
A tour to do,"It was interesting, the money worth. The guide Alex was excellent and great performer. You have a good lunch after or before-your choice. I took a salad and it was great!"
Interesting tour of Opera House,The tour was about an hour. Our guide Ben explained many historical aspects of the construction of this Iconic venue. More info about some of the famous performers or productions would have enhanced the tour.
Great History  Take the Tour,A beautiful structure  Learn the history behind the building of The Sydney Opera House.  Plan your tour and stay for a performance.
Not quite what we were expecting,"During our visit to Sydney we decided to take a tour of the Opera House as my husband had not been inside.  It was interesting to hear about the architect, construction and the indigenous history but we felt that the theatres that we were taken into really lacked any ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of the Opera House.  Also we constantly ran into other tour groups coming into the same areas.  The three areas we were shown did not allow photos to be taken, due to stage sets, but apart from that there really wasn‚Äôt anything that one would want to photograph.  At one stage we walked all the way out of the building only to turn around and go back all the way in to be shown a video in a hallway (and having staff trying to move ladders arounds us) when we could have seen it in the auditorium we had just come out of.We also found it very tacky that the group was herded to a side area to have our photo taken in front of a blank screen before moving back to the starting point.  When we advised the photographer that we didn‚Äôt want a photo he was a bit put off.  If you want to offer this then ask if anyone is interested in this rather than moving everyone towards this area and push them into standing in front of the screen.  It looked like there were tours going every 15 minutes because of a performance in one of the large theatres but it wouldn't have made any difference as we didn't go there anyway."
Ionic,"Very impressive exterior day or night and the setting in the harbour is stunning.  We had an interior tour of the House and luckily, on the last day before a two year renovation of  the Concert Hall."
Sydney Opera House Tour and Dine,"we had a very informative tour of the opera house - very passionate tour guide - thanks Nick! He answered all our queries and the earphones helped so that we could hear him... we could enter both the opera and concert halls, even saw a small part of a pianist rehearsing..."
What an experience!,When visiting Sydney we went to see a production of 'Carmen'at the opera house. The whole evening was brilliant including a meal before and a drink afterwards. You can't do Sydney without this experience.
Bucketlist must! - The Sydney Opera House!,"No one can resist the fascination of the iconic Sydney Opera House, whether your keen to catch up with friends a the Opera Bar or seek fine dining experience at Bennelong or the Opera Kitchen the Sydney Opera House has something for everyone.Seeing the Australian Ballet perform at the Sydney Opera House many times really puts a shine on this iconic venue.Watching the sunset from here is also amazing and a must see for all."
Not to be missed,"This tour was fascinating, both for the history of the architectural decisions, personalities of the key players, and the seemingly impossible, uniqueness of the structure 's design and building materials.  The whole tour process runs very efficiently, and we had an excellent guide named Chris.  He also talked about the many challenges and problems encountered and overcome during the process and in the intervening years since it opened in 1973.  The opera house is actually a  multi-theatre performing arts center which is in constant use for a wide array of programming.  The wear and tear is visible, which is why the opera house will be closed for two years and a multi-million dollar restoration.  The Sydney Opera House is understandably a very important national symbol for the Australian people.  I am so glad I had the opportunity to take this tour."
"Sydney Opera House and the musical ""Six""","The Sydney opera house was beautiful and amazing. We did not have time to do the full tour, but we did get to see the musical ""Six"" about Henry the VIII's wives. It was amazing ! The sound was perfect and the atmosphere was the very best!"
Brilliant.,"We spent an hour on a tour of Sydney Opera House. Worth every penny. Fascinating story, history and building."
Sydney Opera House Accessible Backstage Tour,"The accessible guided backstage tour is designed for those who have difficulty with stairs.  Ours was a small party with one guy in a powered wheelchair. Our two guides were very knowledgeable and looked after us very well.  All travel between floors was by lifts. We saw the backstage areas, the small theatres as well as the concert hall and the Joan Sutherland Theatre.  As the Joan Sutherland theatre was set up for 'West Side Story' after the tour finished my wife and I went to the booking office and bought tickets for that evening's performance. Bonus!"
Great place to visit,This was a very informative one hour tour of the Opera House. It provided a lot of history about the architecture and the a architect.  The guide was very knowledgeable.
Iconic MUST-SEE landmark,"Not many other places make for better photographs on earth! And, just steps from the Circular Quay train stop, you absolutely have to walk around the Opera House and and take photos. Lots of shops and restaurants around, as well as boats and tours all right there along the water. What a great place to go, grab a glass of wine or beer, and soak up the waterfront."
Carmen! ,"What can you say when you exit the Opera House only to find a more brilliant stage in front of you?Getting in and to your seat means endless stairs, and climbing, but go to the bar at rear of Circle for a fabulous view of Bridge to revive you.  About $100 should buy you a Circle seat with a good view."
Guide Tour,"Spent an hour and a half behind the scenes touring with Nick, the opera guide. He was delightful, knowledgeable and engaging. Learnt the story of the opera, past present and future. This was followed by a topnotch meal at the restaurant, Bennelongs (reviewed separately) and a performance of Carmen. All excellent. A must for you Sydney experience."
Opera House tour,"Wonderful tour of the world-famous landmark.  Unfortunately, the star of the show, the main hall, is undergoing renovation and we were unable to see it, but we did see the second hall and a handful of the smaller venues.  So the variation was quite good.  The tour guide obviously loves her job and was very enthusiastic about everything she showed us.  This tour included lunch nearby and while the available menu was limited (part of the deal), we enjoyed it very much and being limited in choices was not an issue at all.  Great way to see the Opera House - just wish we'd been able to stay another day and see a show there."
Great history,"It was pouring when we were in Sydney, but I absolutely loved this tour. They actually fill up quite early, so book it when you know when you'll be going."
Sydney Opera House,"‚ÄòEllo chaps!Few buildings in the world are as famous as the Sydney Opera House. Located on the southern point of the Sydney Harbour, it is impossible to miss. Taking a stroll through the large royal gardens or come from the dock side, there is much to see around the Opera House itself. Many people like to climb the steps and take a quick peek inside. NOTE: You can only really get to the heart of the inside of the opera house by taking a ticketed tour or seeing a ticketed show. Beyond that it‚Äôs still possible to go inside and get a taste of what the interior architecture is like. There‚Äôs also a fancy restaurant on site giving you stunning views of the downtown city and of the harbour. The building was formally opened October 20, 1973 by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. There are multiple performance venues inside, which combined provide space for more than 1,500 performances annually, attended by 1.2 million people per year. It is a build that truly impresses in person and in photos. Overall I give Sydney Opera House five stars out of five."
Interesting tour,"We saw the opera house on the gray line Half-day city tour. They give you a time to tour and handle the group very well. We really enjoyed seeing the construction in the inside of the opera house and the loops they had to go through to build it.  I don‚Äôt know how they handle the tour for people with difficulty climbing stairs, because you do clean many stairs."
Superb tour of the Sydney Opera House,"Behind the scenes, informative and worthwhile tour. Cannot imagine how the original designer of the Opera House must have felt when he was removed from the project. His perfect vision had all but vanished. I was so very glad to learn that in his 80's he was asked to make one of the rooms his entire project. He did so without every having seen it. Politics plays such a nasty role across the entire globe, unfortunately. Much to my daughter's and my delight, we had tickets for Carmen the same day as our tour and we were absolutely intrigued and pleased beyond all expectations, knowing the rich history of the Sydney Opera House."
Beautiful performance in a magnificent setting,"We were there for La Boheme on Jan 3, 2020. We were delighted with the intense performance, made very special by the setting of the theatre in the this extraordinary location in Sydney Harbour. Just visiting the place without seeing a performance is a plan in itself."
Opera House tour,Nice way to see the inside and hear about the Sydney Opera house construction.  Was expecting a little more to the tour but glad we did it since we did not have time to see an actual performance.
Outstanding visit,"We did a tour inside the opera with a well experienced guide, knowing all facts and storries about this building."
Such an Amazing Structure,Sydney Opera House is so magnificent in every way.  Seeing this master piece of architectural design is breath taking.  Make sure to walk all the way around and stand directly in front where you will get the best views of Sydney Harbour and the Harbour bridge.  You can also do an inside tour of the Opera House which I remember doing many years ago as a child.
Awesome place to take photos,This is a must do whenever you're in Sydney.The views from the Opera house are breathtaking and it gives you many opportunities for great pictures.
Can't go to Sydney without seeing the Opera House!,"This is a unique, one of a kind building with a spectacular location. An absolute must see while in Sydney. It's more spectacular than any picture can show."
Backstage Tour,"Definitely well worth doing this very informative and fascinating tour.  Friendly and knowledgeable guide.  Great way to see inside this spectacular building especially if you‚Äôre not planning to see a play, concert, opera or show there."
"It was ok, main hall under construction","The main hall is being renovated,  so we only saw some smaller venues and perimeter spaces. We got conflicting information about the Opera House construction on various tours, but everyone covers the basics, so I wouldnt list it as a must do for the actual tour."
Great tour,"We toured the inside of the Opera House and was most interesting with an excellent guide. Luckily, it was the last day before they were closing the Concert Hall for a two year renovation."
A taste of Opera in the finest Opera house in the world.,"While in Sydney, we had just one day to enjoy a 90 minute ‚ÄúBest of Opera‚Äù opera. This was a Host/Pianist/Comic (in the best way), along with 4 world renown vocalist that each sang some of Operas most popular arias. It was really fun and gave a novice opera goer a peek in to what happens at a full opera. We loved it, even braving a downpour, wind and some brief hail to enjoy this time. We were even able to sing a long so we could all say we sang at the Sydney Opera House!I highly recommend this fabulous experience!"
Lots of facts,"This was a great tour, the guide was very informed and taught so much about the Building and struggles of creating such a unique Edifice. It‚Äôs a must do for people of any age. You should know there are 222 stairs you‚Äôll be climbing throughout the tour. I only wished we saw more of the backstage type of things, but I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs Confidential or something like that.  Great tour, even in the pouring rain!"
Don‚Äôt miss the tour,"The tour was a great way to learn about the opera house and see everything, but also after the tour we were offered special prices on some of the shows.   We took advantage and went to the Opera the next night.  Great seats at a great price!"
Interesting insight to the opera house.,"Guided tour round Sydney Opera House. The guide was very informative, and waas able to illuminate his chat with anecdotes.Very interesting history of how the opera house was planned and designed. Good to see behind the scenes, and how much space is required to store production materials.Great views from the balconies outside."
A place to see,Nice walk if you come though thebotanic gardens. If lucky there will be a light show starting at 21.00
Opera House,"We aren't opera fans - but we did want to see a show in such an iconic bulding.  So we booked tickets for ""No Pay; No Way!"" and it was great!Glad we got to see something we enjoy and still be in such an amazing venue!"
"I'm bias, I live here","Well, our opera house sits on Bennelong Point and has spectacular views of our gorgeous harbour - including The Sydney Harbour Bridge and Taronga Zoo (sometimes, you can even see the heads of the giraffe). But what's most amazing is the architecture of this magnificent building - there's nothing like it in the world. And at the turn of the season (autumn/fall to winter) she puts on a great light show called Vivid and the Opera House makes for a magnificent backdrop during that time. And inside this lovely lady is a plethora of options - Jazz, Opera, Ballet, Musicals, Rock Concerts, Plays....... When you're next in Sydney, do a quick search before you arrive to see what's on to ensure you don't miss out."
Opera house visit,One of the most iconic place to visit and ensure you are there during nights because it is just stunning
Great perspective ,"Having seen the Opera House many times from the outside, it was great to get behind the scenes.Our guide was very knowledgeable and much was learnt. The only disappointment was that the Concert Hall was being refurbished."
Great venue,Do yourself a favor and take the tour.  The tour guides are very knowledgeable and will answer all your questions.  I also like the fact that your provided headphones so you can hear the tour guide without straining.  The Opera House is an amazing achievement of architecture.
Iconic building,"One of the most iconic buildings in the world. Set in one of the most famous harbours in the world with the Sydney harbour bridge offering it the perfect back drop, it‚Äôs one of the most pictures/scenes in the world!"
"Didn't see a show, but saw the outside close up","Having always heard about this edifice, to be able to see it myself was an awesome experience. We ate with a view of it, walked around the gardens by it and saw it from the ship.  They were all fantastic !"
What is not to like?,"A beautiful building, we visited in July 2019 while In Sydney. We booked tickets for a show. We arrived and had drinks then watched the opera we had booked for. I‚Äôd never seen an opera but really enjoyed the show, the sound is just incredible really enjoyed the experience."
Disorganised ,"We thought it would be good to book the tour and dine option to fit in with the SIX show, so we chose the 4:30 tour and booked at the box office yesterday. On arrival at 4:15 today, we were informed that the 4:30 tour had been cancelled, no reason given and no apology, we suspect we were bumped in favour of a larger foreign language tour. No choice but to wait for the 5pm tour which then meant that the dining part was rushed, so much for a relaxed tour/dine/show. Not good management, they seemed to forget who their customers are."
Fantastic Building ,"The two days we were in Sydney we visited the Opera House both days, unfortunately we didn‚Äôt take in a show but we did have a meal in the Opera House Kitchen Restaurant. It‚Äôs a fantastic place to visit and always great for taking photos from all sides day and night. Hopefully if we visit Sydney again we will take in a show or a concert."
Admired from afar,"The tours are expensive and booked too bar in advance for us to have been able to do one, but you can see the Sydney Opera House from the ferry and from lots of vantage points throughout the city."
Outstanding,"If it weren't for the Opera House and the Bridge, Sydney Harbour would still be naturally beautiful but not half so interesting. The Opera House was quite unlike any other building in its day, so very innovative. I didn't appreciate that it is like a canopy over (and separate from) the auditoria underneath. Like most innovative projects it went way over budget and the architect was sacked, never to return to see his completed masterpiece at first hand. It is three separate buildings, none of which is symmetrical and I found this a little disconcerting. Also, despite the appearance of many photos of the building, the roof is not white but more cream-colouured which makes it look a bit dirty.  Despite these comments, it is a groundbreaking piece of design and when it was given Unesco World Heritage status in 2007, it was the  youngest ever building to achive this honour."
SPECTACULAR TO SEE,"The beauty of seeing the Opera House is the overall picture. The beautiful Sydney Harbour Bridge, the waters of the Harbour and Luna Park in the back ground. If you time your photo right you will get a Ferry in there too. It‚Äôs a very popular tourist attraction but well worth seeing."
A lovely walk on a nice sunny day!,I love to catch a bus in to the city and walk down to Circular Quay. First thing I do is check out the MCA (Museum of Contemporary Art). They often have interesting Exhibitions and there is a wonderful shop for souvenirs. Then I stroll along the wharves to the Opera House. If you haven‚Äôt been there it really is worth taking a tour of this iconic building. Following on from here I walk through the Botanical Gardens. There is a great restaurant if you‚Äôre feeling hungry. Then I continue up to the Art Gallery of New South Wales. There are always interesting exhibitions on but if you don‚Äôt feel like paying for the special exhibitions quite a large section of the gallery is free of charge. I especially like the lowest level where the Aboriginal exhibits are displayed.
Iconic,It is a beautiful building in a beautiful location. Going inside to find a show is a little confusing though as there is so much on and no one stop display of shows and times. But the interior is beautiful too.
lovely concert,"we had a lovely concert experience ever in sydney opera house , luckily we 've found something we want to see just before our cruise in sydney .inside stadium  is smaller then we thought ,but nice and cosy ,i cant help but keep looking around while concert was playing .but we enjoy the whole thing ;walking towards the venue the, atmosphy of the bars outside sydney house .its worth getting there early to sit and watch the people and boats passing by."
A must see ,A must-see stop if you're going to be in Sydney. Lots of touristy places to grab a drink or lunch dinner. Watch out for the seagulls as they will come and steal your food rather quickly and in short order. lots of parking and easy to get to walking all around at night is a absolute tree and the views are incredible.
Excellent Tour!,"This was a very interesting and informative tour. I enjoyed it a lot, and would definitely recommend it to others."
Very nice looking stucture,"We did not go into the building, but the structure seemed the most prominent feature in the distance when visiting Sydney harbor."
Good Way to Experience the Opera House,"Of course we wanted to see the Sydney Opera House while here, so scheduled this one hour tour of the facility, and for convenience's sake, added the dinner in as well.  The tour was excellent - very straightforward and factual.   We were able to see the singers for that evening's performance practicing in the opera house as part of the tour.      The dinner at the Opera Bar was excellent -- a choice of three items, steak, fish and a vegetarian dish.   We both chose the steak, which was delicious and well prepared and came with a small amount of veg and potatoes.   Overall a very nice evening at the opera house."
Beautiful,"Great tour and very knowledgeable tour guide, Only sour note, not photos inside of the Opera House were allowed.;("
Awesome sites,We had the inside tour as well as evening and night harbor tour and it gave us a great experiences.  This is a must see when in Sydney.  The inside of how it is built and they guide gives the details is amazing.
Very interesting,"Not as many stairs as advertised and a very interesting tour. A good way to learn some of the history of Sidney. Since this is such an iconic building, don't miss it or you really haven't been to Australia."
Beautiful opera house ,I live in Sydney and the Sydney opera house is beautiful icon to see You will see the unique design and concept on how the opera is built if you visit inside the premises
Sydney Opera House,"An outstanding and world-renown piece of architecture. Viewed it from our ship s it entered the harbor and on land. Impressive +, everything we expected and more. Possibly it was a government job 'cause it came in at triple the original cost, but then Sydney has it and no one else does. So there."
Iconic building does not disappoint,This iconic building is awesome in its design. The tour of the building is very interesting and worthwhile.
Great sampler,"Our guide was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and had lots of history about the Opera House architecture,Utzon, the chief architect, as well as the politics. We had a nice lunch at the Opera bar afterwards."
Beautiful ,"A must visit place in Sydney Australia. Easy access from the downtown, train station, and overseas passenger terminal."
Don't waste your money,"Took guided tour for $42....waste of time and money. We were shown one concert hall, private dining venues, public areas,and the basement. No pics allowed. I'm a world traveler, worst tour I've ever taken. I'd like a refund!!!"
Walking tour of Opera House,"Whilst the SOH is just such an amazing building with such an interesting history, I didn't think this tour was up to par. I felt that there were some important details missed off the tour.  You are not told when you sign up for it, that certain parts of building are put of bounds. Our guide, I felt, was not keen on feedback nor questions. He appeared to be in a rush. I think they need to pull their socks up."
Distinctive architecture ,The Sydney Opera House is a UNESCO site.  We viewed the site from both sides of the harbor. The architecture really stands out in the skyline around the city.
Access Tour is Superb,"My wife was unable to handle all the steps on the normal walking tours of the Sydney Opera House. Fortunately, they offer one tour a day at noon that is accessible without the stairs. It was raining as hard as I've ever seen it rain on the day of our tours but it was definitely worthwhile. We got to see essentially all of the spots on the normal tour without the steps and learning lots of the idiosyncrasies of the Opera House and its development"
Great tour of the Opera House,"This one hour tour was given by Julia and was very informative. The headsets are a real help, especially for those with hearing issues. It‚Äôs only a one hour tour but worth goin on."
Fascinating!,"I always knew that the Sydney Opera House was lovely. It wasn‚Äôt until I visited the opera house, that I realized how magnificent it was. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour that we were given. We saw much of the opera house inside As well as a close-up of the roof outside. It took my breath away."
Well worth a visit to Sydney Opera House.,"When in Sydney as a tourist Sydney Opera House is a must see photo opportunity, however what is better than a tour inside and around thus iconic building. Nick our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable informing us via headphones of the previous history of the land, the decision to build it, the structural issues, the time delays in completion and the arguments that ensued.  We ventured into 3 theatres, the Joan Sutherland theatre and 2 of the smaller theatres but alas the main theatre was closed for a 2 year millions of dollar renovation.  The tour includes walking up and down many steps which could be an issue for some people and Nick did make this clear before we started the tour. It is well worth the visit and 60 minutes of your time when visiting Sydney."
guided tour,This was a wonderful tour as we had access to many parts of the opera house you would not normally see. Given a history of the building  etc  in an unhurried fashion. Lots of steps to climb so you need a reasonable level of fitness
Awesome! ,This iconic landmark hosts some of the best shows and operas in the world!Do not miss the opportunity of seeing an event!
Amazing!,"We booked the guided tour of the Sydney Opera House online at 10 am. We met the guide at the tour meeting  point # 1 for English tour. There were a few people bought the tour ticket on site. The meeting point and the ticket office are underground and near the Opera Cafe/Restaurant. We deposited our backpack at the cloak room. The tour was excellent. The Opera House is amazing. The guide is Nick. Nick is knowledgeable. The tour was about one hour. We took many good pictures while on the tour. If you like good pictures without people , you could go to early morning."
A must do in Sydney,We enjoyed the tour and were able to get a very good deal on. Tickets to the Opera because of taking the tour.  well worth going!
A Must do while you are in Sydney!,"We had the best tour ever of the Sydney Opera House. Our guide was so enthusiastic and told us many interesting facts about the Opera House. We were able to go into 3 theatres.  He told us about the history of the Opera House's conception, architecture problems, changes with time, construction, and stories about the architect and his family.  We loved the Opera House. Afterward, we tried to get tickets while we were in Sydney, but the show we wanted to see was sold out .   Do this while in Sydney!"
Great seats,There was really not a bad seat in the house.  The only issue was getting our things from the coat check at the end of the night.  This needs a bit more organization.
AMAZING OPERA IN A BEAUTIFUL SETTING!,"We saw Don Giovanni last night and it was simply marvellous - the singing, theatrical performances and an amazing set.  However, the evening was rather spoilt at the end when the Chinese conductor took his bow on the stage - booing was heard from either one person or a small group..  Quite unforgiveable in any setting but you would assume that opera goers would behave better."
Opera! Opera! Opportunity can‚Äôt be missed! ,"Obvious a staple of Sydney that everyone must see! It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person! The inside of the building is just as amazing so if you have a chance to do the guided tour or even see a production at the opera house, do it, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
Beautiful Opera House,"The tour guide was so knowledgeable and I learned a lot about the designer of the beautiful House. Unfortunately I could not take photos and was very disapointed. But, bravo, the tour guide was amazing."
As good close up as it is from a distance,"Took the hour long tour to get a better insight to the history of its construction, and to view areas that otherwise may be difficult to see from a concert attendance, or casual visit. The tour was informative and provably worth the reasonably expensive ticket pricing. However, it would have been nice to get behind the curtains into the real backstage areas ( as other opera houses overseas do)The walk around the forecourt is a must do and doesn't cost anything"
Amazing Iconic building,"A must to visit whilst in Syney. Beatiful building, go inside to view auditorium Try to book for a performance. We were there for New Years Eve but the crowds were too much for us."
Tour worth visiting,Nice one hour tour throughout the opera house giving you an overview and history of the building. Visited both concert and opera halls. Worth visiting.
Must-see,"Ofcourse you have to visit the insides of the amazing Opera House if you can. Lovely to hear initially people were so much against it being built, now its just iconic!"
Iconic photo,Great walk around the opera house with some good photo opportunities. Some great little cafes around the harbour to sip a beer and waste an hour or two
Landmark,"The Opera house is a landmark that can‚Äôt be missed.  They had a 6 a.m. sunrise with music that allowed you to sit outside but many people didn‚Äôt know about it.  Also, different programs inside."
Great place that can be done for free,"2nd time i have been here, the area has a few guys with a dog to keep the seagulls under control. Very polite and keeps the area clean. Nice to walk around. If you want a drink or lunch or coffee it is a little pricey but to be expected!Recommend taking one of the ferries to somewhere so you can get a good view of the place"

Sydney Opera House,Great views of Sydney and waterfront.  Water taxis go back and forth.  Heard that the Opera House may close for renevations.  We didn't take a tour because there were activities all day.
Exciting 1 hour tour,I never knew that I would learn so much about this amazing piece of architecture until I took the wonderful one hour tour of the Sydney opera House. The history is fascinating the story of the architecture in all the pieces of material also very interesting. Being able to sit in the concert hall before it closes for the next two years was a great opportunity. I certainly now have a new appreciation of this unique amazing structure.
A fantastic experience!,"An hour ago I was finishing breakfast in the green room, after one of the best guided tours I've taken!Don‚Äôt miss this tour if you really want to understand the development, history and day-to-day workings of the Sydney opera House.We lucked out with a wonderful guide Bella, who is so informative, attentive and also a wonderful host during breakfast. Within the first five minutes she had memorized and could quickly use the names of any of the 12 of us.The tour delivers all that is promised in terms of seeing the orchestra pit, the ballet and opera theatre, other theatres, backstage areas, rehearsal area, the giant lifts and the storage areas, the dressing rooms, with all those other little absorbing  details Mixed in provided by Bella"
Should have been more open (literally),"If the main auditorium is closed for refurbishment then I think they should make it clear before you part with your money. Likewise if you are not permitted to take photos in the most important areas for copyright reasons, they should tell you beforehand. The tour was interesting but we felt way overpriced given the above limitations. Also they take your photo and superimpose it on various SOH backdrops. Very cheesy."
