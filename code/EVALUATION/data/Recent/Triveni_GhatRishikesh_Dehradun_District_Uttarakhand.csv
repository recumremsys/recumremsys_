Ganga aarati Main attraction ,"We reached little late to join the Ganga aarati, but still it was nice. Less crowded, but didn't look like people following any distancing in Covid19 times......neat and clean place though, despite giving space to cattle, stay dogs and beggars."
Triveni Aarti,"The aarti was professionally and artistically conducted. Also it was a pleasant surprise to see, the pandas were not haggling for money. There was a fixed rate for aarti. The association was ensuring practice of COVID precautions"
Naturally made creations,"It is a worth place to go and see the it peacefully. So, you can also see how the three rivers meet at the same point and followed by arti and some shops near by."
best attraction in Rishikesh,"I visited this place twice and i enjoyed each time, this place is must see , very spiritual place,  watch  out for the merchant and store owner with over priced gifts."
Beautiful,Very nice aarti on ganga ji .the view of river is so big and lovely that you do not want to go back from there .Very clean and peaceful place that you can spend hours there
trivet,amazing and serene place at the bank of the river. water is very clean. atmosphere very spiritual. Ganga Aarti looks grand in the evening. very clean although it can be slippery.
Ganga Aarti,"Attend Ganga Aarti with beautiful song under beautiful full moon light, it was an unforgetable experience  when i was in India üôè‚ù§"
Unique experience,The aarti was a unique experience.  But the ghat was crowded and it took some time to get there. The first 2 rows were paid and we had to sit towards the back.
Pure and Divine,Sorry for putting wrong type of visit coz there is no option here.I recently went to Rishikesh with my older parents. This place is completely Pure and Divine. You can spend hours sitting here doing nothing but just watching the clean Ganga and viewing the beautiful scenery around. A must visit if you are in Rishikesh
One of The Best Ganga Aarti,"Few words can never explain the beauty of that aarti. The serene, holy, super chilled and fresh Ganga was looking so gorgeous and the mantras and the aarti added extra flavour to it.It literally gave me goosebumps and you will feel the same too. Hardly anyone will be there, who will not fall in love with the aarti and who won‚Äôt feel pure and blessed.Please guys, visit Triveni Ghat it‚Äôs Must.Timings :: 6pm onwards"
Triveni Ghat aarti,Very well organised. One simple charge for all. Aarti done very well. Ypu feel part of it. Highly recommend. Charge was INR300 only.Less than ¬£3.50
Much neatly maintained than expected,"Watched the sacred Ganga Aarti during sunset. Ghat is very well maintained, you can peacefully take a dip in the holy Ganges and perform Ganga Pooja."
Divine vibes ,"Had an amazing experience, felt blessed. My younger daughter so something religious for the first time she came to know about ganga's importance. Musician and singers had very good Holi songs after aarti,which makes the experience high."
Aarti @ Triveni Ghat,Well organized event. Clean & well maintained surroundings.No hustle and bustle as also decent seating arrangements on the steps.Creates a feeling of bliss and inner happiness with faith.
Nice time doing the pooja ...,This place is very clean... you can make a donation and perform a ganga pooja after which they do they main Ganga Aarti...Worth a visit...
munni ki reti,if you are in Rishikesh and miss Triveni ghat Aarti then the whole trip has no meaning one of the largest ghat and well managed place the 30 minutes of Mantra gives you a diffrent feeling
A truly inspiring night,"Me and my friend loved seeing the traditional evening events at the ghat, songs, dance, fire it was great.My heart yearns to go back there.This devotion is done every night and has been going on for thousands of years.India is a gift to the world"
Good place Good Vibes,Good clean place with positive vibes. Better in the evenings especially during the arti time. Overall a good place.
Pious & Serene !!!,Such a holy and historic place the Triveni Ghat. A fantastic venue for the Ganga Aarti @ Rishikesh. Enjoyed the entire experience. Extremely peaceful experience.UNFORGETTABLE !!!!
Mesmerizing Arati,Very well organised and spectacular arati performed at Triveni Ghat. Atmosphere was great with the devotional songs and spontaneous dance.
Beautiful and peaceful aarti ,"I never miss the Ganga aarti here in Rishikesh. Less touristy, less crowded and you‚Äôll be able to find a seat by the steps and watch the whole procession beautifully."
Beautiful Temple with Inspiring Ceremony ,This sunset ceremony blessing the Ganga in front of this stunning temple was a pleasure to attend.  It was quite beautiful and fun to watch from the bridge as well as up close.
Ganga arti was superb,The ganga arti at triveni ghat was heavenly and was really a truely superb experience. Totally worth the visit and highly recommended
Beautiful AARTI at Triveni Ghat,"Its a lovely beautiful experience to have attended the Ganga Aarti with nice bhajans also playing. Though found things a bit commercial but that doesn't matter because its everywhere, till the time you are happy and in solace seeing the Aarti. Felt beautifully connected with the River Ganga üëåüå∑"
Devine,This place has a very special vibe. The ghat gives a scenic view of ganges... The water flowing here is very clean and calming. The roar or ganges is devine... The evening aarti at Triveni that can not be missed. The view of aarti is spectacular. The pandits performing aarti follow uniform dress code and they perform the aarti with systematic coordination which adds to the Bliss.
Ganga Aarti,Fire ceremony on Ganga river - very spiritual with great fire performance and music.Must attend when in Rishikesh!
Impressive,"Well maintained ghat Arti event . Good experience, would suggest going for it . It‚Äôs wellManaged with less commotion ."
Amazing,A very impressive Aarti. Beautiful and touching. If you wanna have the full experience of a fire ceremony I recommend it strongly.
Must do if you want to experience Ganga Aarti,Was in Rishikesh for 2 days and both days visited Triveni Ghat for the evening Ganga Aarti. They know how to put a spectacle. Extremely well organised and involve the people by giving them an opportunity to do the Aarti. The Aarti singers are very very good and you feel good about the whole experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the aartis and think it is much better than what I saw in Haridwar. Absolutely recommended.
A must watch,"Aesthetically choreographed, environment boosted with chants and lamps - i am sure the worshipers get a good feeling !"
Day and night aarti,"The Triveni Ghat is a very popular sport for Hindus to perform the daily aarti. There are rituals day and night at sunrise and sunset. I was too lazy to get up to see the morning aarti, but the evening ones are amazing to watch. It‚Äôs amazing that in the December weather, people are still willing to take a dip in the river to wash away their sins."
Visit India,"The evening Aarti is a must witness and participate event. You will feel the spirituality of the place, the people and the river Ganga. I suggest that one must make your own offerings to your creator here. It is the gateway to heaven, i have been informed by my guide."
Triveni Ghat is a must visit place in Rishikesh,"We visited Triveni Ghat recently in December 2019.This place reminds me of Ganga Aarti at Varanasi ghatsWe have visited Parmarath Aarti in Rishikesh many times, but Triveni Ghat Aarti is equally good"
 Amazing puja ceremony,"The live music, 15 priests, made this a truly magical experience.We sat on the benches behind the priests, which made this a stronger experience. This required depositing our shoes.Bring warm coats at this time of year."
Daily - Nightly Ritual,"Before sundown, they prepare for the ceremony. You can participate by, a) buy a flower bowl to release to ganga  (20 rupees), b) select a seat by the ghat (remove your shoes first) or simply watch the sunset. It is a very uplifting experience."
For religious people,The ganga arti in the evening starts at 5:45 everyday. That is probably the only worthwhile event  to see. But don't expect a lot and you'll probably have to rent a scooter to get there from tapovan.
Triveni Ghat,"As an Indian, the aarti feels same as one has at home or elsewhere.Probably for we understand what is being said and chanted that it doesnt allure you, maybe because there are no mantras or shlokas as much as one expects."
Triveni ghat rishikesh,Its worth visiting. There is quite big market to shop n eat around ..There are temples...But the moat famous thing about triveni ghat is its aarti....Moat mesmerizing experience...Many pandits standing in a row...Performing aarti with a rythm...After aarti it's bhajan time with people dancing to its tune...Very enjoyable.
Ganga Aarti - Blissful Experience !,A must visit the Ganga Aarti while in Rishikesh. It is very well conducted and is a sight to witness. It is a very peaceful and a soothing experience. Aarti starts by 6pm. Would recommend coming in 15-20mins earlier. Also would recommend to witness the Aarti from outside the sitting zone (right corner) to get the complete view.
Best aarathi in Rishikesh,Aarathi generally happens around 6 pm. Its the best Ganga Aarathi in Rishikesh. A must visit in the evening.
Centre of Rishikesh town.. Place for all,This is centre and biggest open wide place at Rishikesh by Ganga River. Many activities happens here through out the year. The daily activity is Triveni ghat AArti here. There are Krishna - Arjun / Ganga River and Dhiva - Parvati statue here some more on further walk. As Ganga is in its natural form here not like other cities below Rishikesh so sometime the river is far away from the Ghat ( The corner ). People also find beggars and sadhu type people here and share some part of the wealth and all. Need to maintain more.A must place to visit.
arti,Money is prominent and beautification is not very welcome. The Arti with one lamp  should be enough and not 12. This much with added small thalis is very polluting and the pundits should the first to improve the environment.
Divine Triveni ghat,Yes..it is Devine. Take a walk at the bank of ganga in the evening and reach the ghat at time of arati. It is well organized. .less crowded. .even you can do arati and puja by yourself by the help of pujari and enjoy the evening.
Really commercialised and all about money,"As a tourist - I would recommend the aarti at Parmarth Niketan if you can make that. The Niketan aarti is free and followed by a nice satsang where you can learn more about Hinduism. The Triveni aarti was very much about the money with a fire ceremony followed by music and where mostly tourists are dancing. The ‚Äòholy men‚Äô performing the ceremony ask for money at every opportunity - unsolicited ‚Äòblessings‚Äô, giving you the candles etc etc. At one point we explained we‚Äôve already given multiple times and that was met with a ‚ÄòGIVE AGAIN‚Äô. Unbelievable."
Very moving experience,"I was moved by this experience. Well over a hundred people coming together for a spiritual ceremony together created wonderful and strong living energy. After the fire ceremony there was dancing that was so freeing and trance-like. I highly recommend participating even if you are shy and not a dancer. It‚Äôs not about that. It‚Äôs about being a part of the collective and benefiting from the energy of the evening. If you are in the holy and spiritual town of Rishikesh, just go with it and take advantage of all that it has to offer and indulge."
Triveni Ghat,"What a wow aartiüôèüôè. I literally got swept into a spiritual world. While watching the aarti one feels that praying to the almighty gives us inner peace.The surrounding of the ghat is horribly dirty n stinky. Why cant we indians keep our own country clean.  Being an indian i felt triveni ghat commitee should look into all entrances and make it safe n clean There is no safe parking, approach to the ghat from the market is narrow, dirty, stinky with parking mess. If govt wants to promote tourism it should luk into these basic things."
Ganga Darshan,"Must must must place to visit--- the vibrations at Triveni Ghat are sumthing that have to be felt, experienced -- cannot be expressed in words.It's so well organised, beautiful chants, bhajans, the entire Arti experience was very overwhelming & the bhajans after the Arti where everyone just started to dance was a beautiful experience too.A truly Divine experience."
MESMERISING,"If you go to Rishikesh, one thing that we should not miss is the Ganga aarti at Triveni ghat, Even though it happens in other ghats also, the Ganga aarti at Triveni ghat is mesmerising"
One of the most blessed evening! Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat!,"This is one of the most peaceful, clean ghat I have seen. We did an Ganga Aarti here which turned out to be the highlight of our visit to Rishikesh. Very well planned and administered. You really do not need to take anything with you as everything is arranged. The sankalp (wish) is done by you and the actual aarti by one of the priests."
Spiritual ,Amazing Ganga Aarti. A different spiritual feeling when you attend the Aarti here. Listening to the holy songs and chants. So relaxing and spiritually uplifting
Popular ,"One of the popular places for Ganga Aarti although not as popular as Ram Jhula ashram, close to Rishikesh city centre."
Average Ghat,The Triveni Ghat is a bathing ghat at Rishƒ´kesh. A small portion of Ganges is cut out from the main river for bathing at the ghat. The main river Ganges is a little away and one  has to wade through water to reach the main river. Most of the people bath in the cut out portion of the river.
Serene,"superb, the best experience of an Aarti A little commercialized but worth the very cent ..thank u ..The best part is the way the pandits do the aarti in one rhythm and sync with one another ..."
Family visit,Excellent enjoyment of the Ganga Aarati. Need to remain present at 5.30 PM.The place is crowded during evening period. Here everything is pure and good.
A Divine Experience,The Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat was not  crowded like Har ki Pauri.It was well organised and conducted very systematically.It was truly a divine experience.The best part is that the Ganga is not dumped with a lot of rubbish.There are no touts extracting money.Loved the entire experience Would recommend it any day.
Awe inspiring,I was there in the second row. Just imbibing everything with wonder. Feeling the unseen presence. That day it was the Ramkrishna Mission/Math who were doing the yagna. Then I was suddenly called forward by them. To take the first blessings of the havan. Will remember forever.
Triveni Ghat Aarti,"Best Ganga aarti in Rishikest, peaceful and comfortable sitting right close to the river bank and very close to the priests performing the aarti for an unforgetful experience."
Pure Bliss !!! Mesmerized !! JAI GANGA MAIYA !!!,"Triveni ghat is assumed to be a union of 3 rivers viz Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati although only the river Ganga is seen flowing. There is an aarti in the evening somewhere around 6 ish in winter and 7 ish in summer. It is a mesmerising sight to see so many pandits standing on a stage and performing an aarti for River Ganga. Pure Bliss!! Har Har Gange!! JAI GANGA MAIYA!!!"
A spiritual experience,I am not religious but attending the Arti was a wonderful spiritual experience. It was well organised and started and finished as planned. A lot of people who attended appeared mesmerised with the visual and sound experience. It is an experience that will remain with me for a long time.
"With our friend, Manor from Turban Adventures ","This was our 3rd Aarti on our 2nd visit to India.  This was, by far, the best (better than Varanasi).  I felt it was more personal, engaging the crowd all along the way... the best part was at the end when we had a huge dance party with people from all walks of life.  Truly amazing!"
Truly Divine and peaceful,Truly Divine and peaceful - Must have experience. Go at evening to enjoy Aarti organized by them. Thanks.
Beautiful Ganga aarti,Guests were seated in an orderly way. Everyone was given a chance to do the aarti. Very beautifully conducted ...a must watch for those visiting Rishikesh
Fabulous View,The ghat is situated at a beautiful scenic location sorrounded by Valley.There is so much peace hearing the sound of water flow.
Spirituality ,What a experience of Lifetime it is visiting this the ghat situated on the banks of Holy Ganga river . It‚Äôs a lifetime experience
Indescribable experience,The experience of hearing the chanting and the hundreds of lamps moving rhythmically to the chant is mesmerizing.  Place is relatively clean.
pathetic state of affairs at this awful place,Very poor service. Not at all customer friendly. Late service. No sorry for wrong things. Food quality no good and taste is bad. Not delicious. Please avoid this place if you value your pocket and decency. The managers and cashiers are also ill-trained and non-professional.
Ganga Aarti spectacle for all!,"What is interesting about the Aarti at Triveni Ghat is, apart from the pomp and the sanctity and the splendid choreography and synchronization behind it, there is a desire to include one and all in the aarti to pay obeisance to the Ganga. Every family in the audience is given an aarti thali so they can participate and that elevates the experience to a truly memorable and special one!"
Ganga Maiya ki Jai,Went to Triveni ghat on our trip to Rishikesh and Haridwar. We went for the arti that starts at 6.30 in the evening. Really impressed with the discipline and decorum maintained during the entire procedure.The surroundings were neat and clean and no major hustle bustle before or after.The way to the ghat is through the main market which also is vibrant.You can enjoy street food also.Overall a pleasant experience.
Must Visit At Rishikesh,"This is the place where the rishikesh is famous for that, and every one must visit this place for complete their trip of rishikesh."
Never miss this Ganga Aarti,"This celebrating is so different to the one in Haridwar. In Rishikesh you probably get quite another impression, might be you get really touched by the special atmosphere:  you only between some hundreds of  people joining this celebration and not among thousands and thousands of pilgrims in Haridwar"
Triveni Ghat,We participated  in the Triveni Ghat Aarti.It was fun and exciting.What s please to see the aati happening besides the fast flowing Ganga river
The Banks of the Ganga ,The Aarty ceremony is worth seeing in the evening a ceremony with the monks.   to honour the ancestors and the people who have passed on
Impressive Ganga aarti,"Having visited the aarti at two different ghat in Varanasi and also in Haridwar, this was impressive. There were a dozen pandits and it was much less crowded than we had expected so we had a good view."
Aarti,You can come here as early as 6.45am or at 7pm in the evening to experience the priests/ pundits perform the aarti. Its an amazing experience and a must do on your list when you are in Rishikesh.The water gushes down along the stretch of the ghat and there are several access points with chained supports for people to take a dip in the divine Ganga river without worrying about being swayed away by the current.
Ganga Matha Aarthi at sunset everyday,"Its an amazing experience to just sit and watch this event which takes place everyday at sunset. Rich in color, with music, singing and people dancing thereafter to hymns. Something needed for your soul."
Amazing experience,Well maintained ghat with Aarti. You will love the atmosphere full of devotion. Things are systematically organised
Triveni Ghat,"We saw the Ganga Arti both at Har ki Paudi in Haridwar as well as at Trveni Ghat in Rishikesh. Both places have their charm. There was less crowd at Triveni Ghat but a magical feeling. We participated in the Arti. It was dusk time and the whole atmosphere was charged. The gradually darkening skies, the flames, the chanting and sound of bells.."
Lovely place specially in the evenings,Went with family had a great time. the aarti was mesmerizing. beautiful view of the beautiful Ganga flowing. Neat and tidy place. People dancing and rejoicing during the aarti is a great view. Not to be missed.
Best Ghat in Rishikesh,"Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh is one of the biggest and famous ghats located at the confluence of three Holy River Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati."
Great view of the ganges located near the market,A great view of the ganges river where you can really appreciate the current and enjoy some time to think and have a moment of peace. There is a market nearby which has lot so shopping outlets (clothes and decor) and street food. The evening prayers were wonderful coupled with the great view in the evening across the river.
Enchanting!,An enchanting and spiritually stirring experience that words really can't describe. The entire process is well co-ordinated and visitors are made to feel welcome to observe or participate if you so wish.
Shop till you drop!,Lot of cool stuff to buy in and around Triveni ghat! You can buy some really cool traditional clothes or just dupattas or you could get yourself some really nice traditional bags /purses. The bags/purses are more Rajasthani style inspired. The clothes stores are good though! Don't forget to go watch the Ganga Aarti that starts at about 7pm. Of you pay 300 RS. The poojaris will also let you do some parts of the Pooja as well as let you stand right at the front! It's the biggest market of Rishikesh with budget to 3/4 star hotels around.
Something is better then nothing,"Visited with the group if 17 family and friends with teenage children.Reaching there itself is a pain in over crowded roads and swatcch bharat is not even remotely here to say the least......Nature is divine here with lots of history also,we reached there at Arti time which is around sun set ,hugely popular place with extremely limited facility and concern of safty and cleanliness is no where to be seen.The view of flowing Ganges and mountain range along with setting sun with Arti and diyas are breathtaking .This place has everything to be developed as one of the best travel destinations of the world but half heartedly and pathetically managed.When u leave the ghat u feel alas.."
holy place,A divine place in Rishikesh. You can have a darshan and participate in the Ganga arthy daily at 7.30 pm. you can also walk a 5 km walk along with ganga. Must visit place.
Colourful and enchanting!,"It's mesmerizing to see a group of people praying in cores. loved it, very much recommended to experience."
Ganga Aarti,Ganga aarti is one of the greatest attractions in Rishikesh. This is a Hindu ritual and is done with lot of devotion. Millions of people visit this place as it is a very holy site.
Amazing Postive Place,A must visit to this place for every individual once in a life time with the essence of true Indian culture of worship Ganga River.
A divine sight,"This is the main ghat in Rishikesh where Ganga aarti is done in the evening. The aarti site gets crowded as spectators and devotess pour in. The arti is music to ears and treat to eyes. A sense of peace fills your soul at the divite site.  During the day people take a dip in Ganges and the place gets less footfall.I should not be saying this for a  religious place, but with litter strewn all over, it does not feel good. In the name of worshipping Ganga, they also throw in plastic and non biodegradable waste. And you cant even fight, because they give you a sharp look and turn their back at you."
Ganga arthi,We have visited Rishikesh on 17th july and have dharshan of Ganga arthi. By paying Rs. 500 you can perform puja to Maa Ganga and also do arthi along with pandits. But the number of people performing pooja are limited one has to go early and book for pooja and arthi. It was a nice experience. Even though it was monsoon time there was no rain and we were able to perform ganga arthi.
Prayer meeting at holy river ganges (ganga),"It was a goosebumps moment for me when I attended prayer meeting at Triveni Ghat at 7 PM in the evening.It is a belief that those who take a dip in triveni ghat will have release and relief from all the sins.it was a summer time and  water was extremely cold.There is also a small around triveni ghat for buying gems, stones, knickknacks, puja items, paintings etc."
Absolute Must!!!,This is a beautiful spiritual ceremony with live music and a fire display. We felt as if we were the only tourists there but everyone running the ceremony was keen to have us sitting front row so we would see everything and participate. Real Indian authentic experience. It‚Äôs on every night at 7pm and the locals are more than happy to see you there.
Mesmerising Holy Experience at Triveni Ghat,Performing Puja and Aarti at  Triveni Ghat is awsome. Singer and his band was really great. It is organised by 'Ganga Sabha' .
Ganga Aartiüôè,"You can enjoy Ganga Aarti....this ghaat is very beautiful, aarti starts around 7.45 pm. You can do personalised aarti also"
Must Visit to see Life Time Experience,"During my stay in Holy City of Haridwar, I visited the Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh. Ganga Arti is the main attraction of this place. You can participate in the Arti on payment of nominal charges along with the regular team/ organiser of the Arti. It gives you lot of satisfaction. You feel blessed & gor internal peace."
Must to Visit,This place is one of the most ideal location in Rishikesh specially if you like to participate and see the famous Aarti of The Ganges.
Nice Little Ganga Ghat..,Nice little ghat in the beginning of Rishikesh. It was at a walking distance from our hotel. We attended Ganga Aarti in the evening and it was a very nice experience. Our hotel's manager helped us to the Ghat so that we got a nice seat. The Ghat was well lit as well.
Mesmerized ,Attended evening Aarti Totally different feeling. Felt Blessed. Different spiritual experience. Got energized. Too crowded. Should reach 1 hour early minimum so you can get better place. Must Visit.
Amazing experience!!!,Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat was an amazing experience!It was well organised and comfortable than the Ganga Aarti we experienced at Har ki pauri in Haridwar!
The Aarti Ghat,This is the ghat in Rishikesh where evening aarti happens. A must visit place to experience the divinity.
Inner Peace.... connecttion to GOD,"evening time and aarti chants and lanterns around you. jut relax and listen to the inner voice . it is little croudy during season time, best time to visit this is during march or in Sep/oct.you will realise how important is ganges for hindu which is covering 29 mega cities, 23 cities and 49 towns. which was life line for more then crores of people."
Krishna Misthan Bhandar,The best place to have excellent chats and foods. We heard a lot about Rajasthani Mishthan Bhandar but were disappointed due cleanliness and lack of chats.....But KMB has all and excellent quality
Aarti at Ghat,Must visit in the evening at aarti time. You can also participate in aarti. Live aarti singing with many pandits performing aarti in a systematic uniform manner is the sight to remember.
Pilgrim place ,Beautiful Arti there were so many lanterns and sound of chanting of Mantras it was divine. The beautiful view of Ganga and the elephants on the other side
Nice ambience,The place is good at the evening time during hot summer days. The Ganges water just soothes the mind and body. Evening arti alongside the Ganges is divine. Worth a visit.
Shiva veneration by fire ceremony.,"A nightly ritual where fire and incense are used by young men in a a well choreographed dance routine to honour Shiva and his affiliation with the Ganges, spectators get to sit on red carpeted stairs on the ghat to get the closest view and then light their own offerings to set sail on the sacred river."
mesmerizing,I ahd life time memorable experience here.Did arti in front of river ganga which was flowing right in front of my eyes.very beautiful site and also very spiritual.i loved it.plz do not skip this part of your trip
Worth an experience,The Ganga Arti on Triveni ghat is a good experience. It is very crowded. But chanting of prayer with Aarti is quite captivating. Parking is a big problem.
It's goooood,"A must visit .really enjoyed and mesmirised.very clean and systematic .Near by marine Bay walk is a must ,only 100 metres"
"Very Clean Ghat, Wonderful Aarti!!","Triveni Ghat is THE place to see the Ganga Aarti! With live bhajans, meticulous step by step process, its a peaceful and divine experience. From our hotel, we had escort service to the aarti and were seated in a place from where we had a very nice view of the entire aarti. The live bhajans, complete with pleasing accompaniments enhances the Ganga aarti experience. So very well managed. Having seen the Ganga aarti at Haridwar, i would strongly suggest that Triveni ghat aarti is the best. We did Ganga Snaan in this ghat as well. Very very clean.  Swach Bharat ideology is maintained by the tireless workers here. The changing rooms for ladies are pretty clean with several stalls manned by a lady supervisor. For the kind of population that this town receives, i would give this ghat a super thumbs up in terms of cleanliness & the overall management. The boardwalk on this ghat is so very wonderful, especially in the mornings and evenings, with Ganga flowing right next to you. The entire boardwalk is very very clean with no shops or hawkers. MUST VISIT PLACE!!!"
Best Ganga ghat!,Heavenly place to see the evening Ganga Aarti. It is so well managed and clean. You can partifpate in the Gnaga aarti too. You can hangout there post the arrti for lovely bhajans and just like that. I would like to visit it againa and again. If you are lucky you can sight elepahnts at the other end just like I did.
Awesome experience,Delightful an peacefull aarti with a good view unlike Har ki Pauri. Administrative People are helpful.
"Ganga aarti at Triveni ghat, Rishikesh","If one wants to see Ganga aarti, Triveni ghat is the place. On most days it is not crowded and one can get a good view of the entire aarti. The background has beautiful view of the mountains and is serene. I visited Triveni ghat for the 2nd time along with my family and friends. Just loved being there."
good feeling and great hindu culture,"the arati in the evening was fantastic. though the sitting area is very congested, one can have a good view from distance. every evening the arati is performed. one can reach the area by little walk from the main road."
amazing aarti must visit Triveni Ghat,"it was a divine experiencethe rhythm, the mantras, the aarti, the joyful crowd-just loved it.please sit on the steps outside the pandal for better photo shoot-"
Commercialised ,"I took much effort to reach this place expecting a divine experience , but it was disappointing . You won‚Äôt find the synchronised aarti here though they try to achieve it . Biggest mood spoiler is the annoying announcer who announces names of the money doners !What in the name of God ???"
Super Aarti,It is a wonderful place. One can have a very cozy comfortable walk on the marine drive of Rishikesh. Very pleasant walk on the bank of Ganga. It was even wonderful as it was full moon light and super view of Ganga at night. During the afternoon on the marine drive one can spot some wild elephants on the opposite bank. Aarti (7pm) at this ghat of Ganga is celestial and excellent. Don't miss this Aarti if it's your first time in Rishikesh. One km away on the same  marine drive (only pedestrian) path is good restaurant Ganga kinare. For those who like great ambience and good food served in good style. Mushroom soup and mint ice cream recommended.
Don't Miss it,I went to see this aarti with no expectations at all and came back filled with a feeling of awe and peace at the beauty and dignity with which the aarti was conducted. It like a ceremonious dance ...not loud like the rishikesh aarti. Truly a treat not to be missed!
Make sure you won't get wounded while taking bath there.,"While travelling to Rishikesh you will be asked to visit to Triveni Ghat. It's a well known location for sprituals who wanna take a dip in the holy river. People there mostly locals and even hawkers will take care that you are not entering into river water wearing slippers because it will pollute the river or Maa Ganga. But on the other side you can see these people throwing their waste there including breaked statues, portraits of indian gods, waste from their temples and all the kind of waste they thought to dispose in Ganges. As while taking the holy dip at this ghat I got one scissor on my hand by a glass portrait thrown by these intensely spritual people. And the stairs of this ghat are very slippery.So, try don't be hurted by these waste Articles while taking bath at ghats in The Ganga."
Missed the evening arti,We visited the place during the day time. And hence missed the Ganga Arti. But yet sitting by the riverside was so comforting  and calming.
Spiritual evening with Ganga Aarti ,It has always been wonderful experience in the evening and listen to Hindu religious songs and pray to holy river Ganga with the beautiful Aarti ceremony in the evening and experience the peace and enlightenment
My Favourite Ganga Ghaat,"I dont think theres any better ghat for public on Holy Ganges.In the middle of Rishikesh City, crowded market. Good for a holy dip, pics & street shopping & snacks."
Awesome Experience,It was an awesome experience just around SUNSET on the GANGA. Must visit if you are in Rishikesh.  Also floating the small leaf vessel with flowers and diya is beautiful view
Aarti ,We all very happy when attend this program. Specially attracted by Guruji whom perform Aarti  . It‚Äôs is better to reach this place as early as possible
A cool place to watch River Ganges,"For those interested in enjoying the beauty and sacredness of River Ganges, this is a good option located in Rishikesh. A cool place to sit and enjoy watching River Ganges. The evening Aarti is an added attraction. But while visiting carry your snacks and drinking water, as well as some cloth to spread on ghat and sit. The sitting accomodation is very less. Be careful if you take a bath in river, as water levels can rise alarmingly any time. Parking is there, although a bit crowded."
Spiritual evening,Triveni Ghat is very spiritual but a lot smaller and more intimate Aarti than other places. I preferred the evening ceremony here.
Release it all...,I went early to see them set up and how everything was ... and the time flew by like it was nothing... the music was pleasant and relaxing...the whole vybe changed when as  sun went down and the Aarti started i was hypnotized and my senses took over ... i took part as much as i can and had an amazing time ..
Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh,"Triveni Ghat is the Famous and biggest ghat located at the confluence of the three holy river - Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. Every morning and evening thousand of devotee take the ritual baths to holy river and believed that ghat wash away all their sins and purifies the soul."
Soul calming ceremony,"In April the tourists are fewer, but locals travel this time so it is still a popular ceremony taking place every evening by sunset. It is very different from the one in Varanasi. It almost seems calmer. Security controls entrance to the ghat so you will need to wait your turn to get through. The best seats are on the firs couple of marble steps before the landing that leads to the ghat."
mesmerizing Pooja,Gives you goose bumps with all the bhajans and the ambiance.They all go in sync and it lasts for about 45 Minutes.It doesn't have any entry fee. Just go with a calm mind and  feel the fresh breeze of The Ganges and nothing but positivity all around you.CheersShilpa
Best Ganga Aarti!,"The best Ganga Aarti! Mystic, mysterious, devotion...Definitely go here. You‚Äôll be amazed. The photos speak for itselves."
"Discover your soul with sound of water, sight of hills and feel of sand","if you are looking to experience ganga in natural form(less human interaction) this is the place to be.it sure does have lots of shops and travlllers but the river side is located a bit far from all man made things shops/roads/apvement, one has to walk through sand to experience water itself. the opposite side of river is view of hills in Rajaji Nationl park, one can sometimes  easily encounter elephants / deers etc. drinking water on other end of the river"
Holiday,The ganga aarti was memorable one.Aarti took about 45min to finish.A good walk of 2km is mandatory.Please be sure that you reach on time by 6.45pm max.
Aarti at Triveni Ghat,Mesmerising experience it was to be part of the evening Aarti at Triveni Ghaat. It was there in to do list for long.
Must see arti,This is a place in Rishikesh where the river flow is calm. There is an island in the river as well. The arti starts after 6:30 pm in summers. There is an old market nearby.One can take shared auto or book an auto from their hotels to visit this place Arti was very well organized and we get to have a good view as well
A Good Venue for Ganga Darshan,"I visited it during day (2 PM) as well as at 'aarti' time (around 6.30PM). Both times it was an enriching experience. What was surprising was the total absence of touts and beggars. There were, of course, mendicants sitting in their places but they did not follow or chase you."
Exciting end to the day,"This is a popular venue and we were advised to get there early to enjoy a good view.  The ceremony is enchanting to watch, accompanied by sung prayers.  Following the ceremony there is a musical performance which, on the occasion of our visit, included a rendering of the Hare Krishna mantra which older readers will recall was performed by George Harrison of The Beatles.  Great entertainment which you can join in with.   Enjoyed this more than the evening Aarti at Haridwar."
Sublime experince of Ganga arti at Triveni Ghat,"I visited Rishikesh on 6th of April 2019, the experience at Triveni ghat was awesome. it was a magical experience.The Ghat is famous for its Ganga aarti. Generally, aarti starts by 6:30 pm and last for 30 mins to an hour. I would say, attending Ganga aarti at Rishikesh was an amazing experience"
The Confluence,"The confluence of three rivers ie. holi river Ganges, Yamuna, and Sarswati has been inspiring to millions whether the river Yamuna and Saraswati are hardly found or just exist symbolically here but inspire to do well and let them flow without any hurdles. Triveni Ghat is one of the major place for Religious and Spiritual Practices. Numbers of people come to have a holi bath and worship. At every evening the Arti  happens by several Brahmins or priests. Not only Indians but also the foreigners of all corners of the world come there and get the feeling of Bliss. This is one of the Charm of this Holi City of Rishikesh for time immemorial."

Must visit in Rishikesh,A beautiful and vibrant Ganga Arti. It starts before sunset and lasts for about an hour. A must visit in Rishikesh.
Must see ceremony in Rishikesh,You must attend an aarthi ceremony to experience a significant part of the Hindu faith. Very spectacular and intriguing. The ceremony lasts for about an hour so get there before sunset and enjoy the sights and sounds.
Ganga aarti,Recommended by hotel staff for aarti at this places was great ful. Nice place on bank of river with lovely sound of aarti. Crowded but large places
Beautiful ceremony,Peaceful and beautiful evening ceremony and we really enjoyed the chanting of the hymns during the aarti.
Unforgetable experience,"Perfect Indian spiritual experience. Music, fire, people, colours. Amazing. One of the experiences I miss most in India."
Outstanding People Watching and Ceremony,"Do not miss this, it is a lot of fun, great for photos and experience.  You will meet lots of people and enjoy the spectacle."
Enjoyed  evening aarti,Visit  here for holy bath and stay till evening  for arti.  Nice river bank.. Great sound of arti feel u awesome
Enjoyed Aarti,On Ganga ghat we enjoyed Aarti . We also performed pooja after taking dip in holy Ganga . It was a good experience
Spectacle,"I am offering my comments not as a devotee but as an  ordinary individual.I attended Aarti at Triveni Ghat on March 20. It was evening and weather was pleasant.	Aarti was a spectacle to watch  . Clean Ghat with plenty of room to sit and watch. Punctual and well orchestrated. Hundreds were happy to listen to the Bhajan and watch the Aarti. Some participated Aarti. It is odd  to say this but I was left with no feelings of solemnity. The music was loud and atmosphere noisy. There were no facilities for drinking water and worse no toilets. There is a pathway,  rather a road , 10 ‚Äì 12 feet wide that runs along the Ganga for many kms. It is clean and free from traffic . In the morning one could go ( as I did for two days )  for a long walk watching Ganga flow and the mountains watching us ! You can not but wonder how Ganga has nourished civilizations for thousands of years and had become part of our lives. It was physically and emotionally satisfying experience.I congratulate the town authorities for providing such a beautiful walk way. I humbly suggest that they provide drinking water facility as well as toilets as the path is long and sure to attract visitors. I wish they do something for the regular roads, choked with traffic, pollution etc"
Great AArti,got  a chance to attend offering and be part of prayer.What a synchronization it was.16 pandits offerings in a row.great experience
Marvelous experience,Visited Triveni Ghat at Rishikesh.Participated in Sandhya Aarti.The whole thing was so well organized and it was a wonderful experience.
Most special partic ourtrio,"Incredible Aarti ceremony on the banks of the Ganges was beautuful, interesting and a moving spiritual experience."
Magical sunset,"I really loved this experience and if you want to see a larger show sort of Aarti, this should be seen at least once! The music is so nice and it is nice to walk the central market afterwards."
Very interesting - memorable experience ,"While being around, you should watch this ceremony. It is really interesting to watch the performance, listen to the music and just be part of it.Great cultural experience."
Very good place,I visited in triveni ghat on every weekend it's very beautiful place And this place is having very beautiful aatti ganga puja ceremony
Money minded visits. ,"Triveni ghat has a segregation based on who pays extra for a pooja at the ghat. Those availing these services and paying extra get to sit at the front. If you try to go and sit at the front, the goons present will misbehave with you and ask for some money to sit there. In short completely money minded management who are not at all interested in managing the place better without any discrimination or biasness."
Aarti,"Aarti at the Ghaat starts just as the sun sets, so there is no fixed time for it. It is advisable to get there a bit earlier. We were told that it starts around 6.30 pm, however, when we got there just after 6.15 it had already started.The area where the Aarti takes place is very neat and clean."
Just Divine! Unexplainable experience! ,"What a place! The aura and the positivity of the place become more and more intensive as the Ganga Aarti  starts in the evening! Must visit place in for devotees for Ganga Aarti.Flower offerings to river Ganga at Sunset is also a divine experience! You can fill the gangajal in a bottle to carry home.The ganga aarti fills the atmosphere with lots of positivity. In reality, the tears started flowing from our eyes! The satsang after Ganga aarti is also awesome!We spent almost 1.5 hrs at this place.Felt  blessed and grateful."
Holiday,"A soothing place for body and soul. The view of Shiwalik and the Ganges is great. The Ghat is mainly a religious place but anyone can go there. Sometimes the managing authority may annoy you for stupid things such as washing in the river or wearing shoes near the GhatThe sun drops over the mountains and the chant begins then 'candles' are lit and the light ceremony begins. After the ceremony the people dance and put small rafts, with fire on them,into the Ganges. A wonderful eveningLovely place where the locals seem to hangout. The atmosphere is so light and tranquil. Wonderful to walk along art sunset and absorb the sights and sounds."
Awesome,Triveni Ghat Arati is simply awesome! You have to be there to see what I am talking about. Every evening it‚Äôs a pleasure which can‚Äôt be replicated.
Impressive ceremony,The Aarti is very well organized and beautifully carried out. Arrive early to see the activities on the ghats.
Blissful Blessed Waters,The Triveni Ghat at a glance appears just a ghat but by the evening hours the whole area transforms into a magical vibrant energy as the song and prayer gets added on.
Yoga Retreat,A moving experience the fire ceremony was beautiful and the chanting atmospheric and after ceremony dance and music was good fun
Unique experience ence,There are ceremonies in the evening on both sides of the Ganges and both are quite different. Nice walk over the suspension bridge. Watch out for the monkeys.
Enchanting Ganga Aarti,We reached the ghat at 6 pm and got seats in second row.Mesmerising Aarti by 16 pandits and team of singers and accompanists started right away.We really had a nice experience listening to shlokas and Aarti.
Worth a Visit,It is always exciting to see the Ganges Aarti. Conveniently located it is worth a visit. One can also perform the Aarti assisted for a small contribution
Magic India!,"A wonderful ceremony,every evening short after sunset! Praying, singing, dancing, fires around, flowers drop on Ganga River! A must go 1000%!!"
Beautiful ganga aarti,"We visited this place on a saturday. Very well organized entry and seating system. The managers there made sure that all guests feel welcome. The aarti starts at 6pm to 7pm. Do reach early to take front row steps seats. During the aarti they also give diyas and pooja thali to general public there, we also got the privilege to do aarti. It was a fantastic experience. Very different and very beautiful aarti.Must visit plsce."
Mesmerized!,A beautiful riverside(ghat) and a sacred place to hindus... the best time to visit there is in the evening at sunset because everyday at that time a beautiful ceremony of worshipping the holy river takes place... rest the pictures says it all
Vast rivershore with ancient temples and Grand Maha Aarti,This is a must visit place while in Rishikesh. Best time is evening around 6 PM to attend the function called Aarti. Very pious and worshipful atmosphere.
Ganga Arti,The ghat is very good and the Ganga Arti is very beautiful and divine.A must visit in Rishikesh. We visited for the Ganga Arti evening and it lasted for around 1 hour and is was very good.
Triveni ghat,Great experience...quiet n serene...not very crowded...evening aarti is bliss...walk from the ghat along the bank of Ganges till Ram jhula is also worth taking.
From afar ,"This is quite pleasant to watch from across the river. I recommend from Beach Cafe, I got a great viewing from there."
Spectacular aarti,"Very nice aarti , spectacular ! And without unmanageable crowd. The river current is fast, and this ensures cleanliness. The ghat area is also clean. The sight of people from various countries dancing together after the aarti was a bonus."
Must visit and experience ,Flooded with tourists. Nice and pleasant experience to view. Starts around sunset around 6 pm upto 7pm. Must visit and view the same if around Rishikesh.
Holy bathing,Well connected from river front road as well as from city road. Place of holy bathing and worships. Evening Ganga Arati is also attraction of this point.
the experience is amazing,this is a must go/see cerimony in this place.  something difficult to explain. just go and live it. It will be a gift for yourself.
Har har gangey,Triveni Ghat is quite old and good for taking a dip in Ganges... It has parking right on Ganges. Proper place for females to change clothes... Ganga Aarti in evening is a spiritual experience..
Peace and joy watching the Ganga aarti,"This is the least commercialized of the two Ganga Aarti‚Äôs in Rishikesh. More locals here. We were there by 5.15 pm and settled ourselves on the steps. This is where you should sit to get a lovely view of the whole procession. Everything was so orderly. They start at exactly 6pm. The singing and chanting were just beautiful. There‚Äôs a place to keep your shoes for a very small fee. It‚Äôs good to carry wet wipes or old socks if you‚Äôre worried about dirtying your shoes. Having said that, I must say they upkeep this place fairly well. There‚Äôs also a walkway from Triveni Ghat where you can walk along the Ganges river. It was just breathtaking. The water is extremely clean."
Spiritual ,"Feel here is amazing, it‚Äôs purely mesmerising. One can practice yoga, meditate or just roam around in the market. Must visit!"
Amazing spiritual aarti !,"the Triveni ghat is less crowded than the one near Laxman Jhoola. The format and duration of aarti remaining same.Starts around 6.30-7pm and easy to find a good place. The pandits are very polite and invite spectators to take part in the actual aarti. The ganga aarti is one of the most spiritual sublime aartis I have witnessed. The lighting of the flames and diyas , the chanting, bhajans all synchronised are beautiful. Lasts for around 45 minutes and you can then take the diyas and flowers and float it in the Ganges."
Peaceful and mesmerizing,"Everyone should go to triveni ghat aarti if you are in rishikesh, the bhajans and aarti is so mesmerizing that you won't to leave from there."
nice synchronized ritual,"access is an issue, driving is out of question. nevertheless the Ganga Aarti makes a good impression, the organizers should also focus on trash management"
Incredible cultural experience,This is a must for anyone visiting Rishikesh.  This evening fire ceremony is breathtaking.Placing lanterns with marigolds on the river and watching as people opted for special blessings was beautiful.
Positive Vibes,A must do thing when visiting Rishikesh. The Arati or Pooja is done to the River Ganga. It starts by 5.45 pm and goes on till 7.00pm everyday.
Devotional,"Top Attraction of Rishikesh.. Devotional feeling, looks beautiful in lights during evening time. Evening Ganga aarti is non skipable, surrounded by market area."
Triveni Ghat Aarti,"Beautiful, spiritual experience. One must do. The ghat and premise is very clean and the organisation runs it very systematic and smooth."
Ganga Aarti,Very spiritual experience with music and fire where three rivers used to meeting.  A must for tourists and natives visiting. No pictures allowed during the ceremony itself.
Aarti on Ma'Ganga,This is a must do event in Riskikesh for devotees and even tourist interested in local and ancient customs. If you want to have rituals for you/family etc. Expect to give 300INR donation to the temple and then have additional donations made direct to Brahmins for their spiritual service. It is a beautiful and dramatic experience of prayer and light!
Serene atmosphere,"When you surrender yourself to the great powers miracle happens. üòáWhat a holy place.‚úåüôèRiver Ganges, Ganga Aarti,Awesome scenery views, Temples, River rafting, markets, natural feeling, peaceful location. Must visit location"
Not very clean,Polluted water with lot of junk. Poorly maintained. Not suitable for children. But the aura is very spiritual at the evening time.
Religious ,"Wonderful, peaceful, enjoyable place especially in the evening. Sitting at the ghat, watching Aarti make yourself happy. Enjoying the flowing cool Ganga is amazing."
The best Ganga Aarti in Rishikesh,we saw our first ever Ganga Aarti here at Triveni Ghat and were blown away and actually quite moved. We removed our shoes and entered the seating area where we treated to this special and uplifting ganga light ceremony. We ended up watching it again the next night but as a photographer chose to stay outside the main viewing area and off to the side. My images did not disappoint. And the ceremony is still one of the most beauiful i have ever seen. MUST SEE!
Jai Maa Gange !,This is one of the best thing to do in rishikesh. i really loved this place you will get all positive vibes all time here. evening ganga aarti is best part of this place. peoples who are taking care of this place big thanks to you all. you are doing such a great job there.
Spiritual feeling,"We visited Triveni Ghat in the month of Nov 2018, Ghat was clean and aarti was well organized. we enjoyed very much."
Great experience,"Great feeling when you attend the Ganga Aarti, its out of the world experience.The bhajans that are performed during and after the Aarti are a real great experience. The arrangements are good."
Triveni ghat ganga aarti,"The most beautiful ganga aarti fo rishikesh, the setup and location are great. No hussle, and the aarti is beautifully carried out. Very powerful. The singing and dancing after the aarti was beautiful"
Gangaji aarti,The Aarti was very well organized. Its already famous for the aarti and we were lucky to get a mesmerizing view of Aarti. It feels very peaceful to be part of aarti
Great views!,"Beautiful area, especially in evening when Ganga Aarti begins. Impressive statue of ""Mother Divine"" with Shiva sitting next to her and a man meditating infront of her. Great for pictures with Ganga river and Temple in  the background."
Unforgettable  Experience of the Ganges Arati - Spectacular and Mesmerising,"The arati performed in this place is an unforgettable experience. 16 priests perform the arati standing on a pedestal.The music, the chants, the freshly lit lamps, the synchronised movement of the diyas by the pandits right on the banks of the triveni create a mesmerising visual.Have attended 3 different aratis in this region - Har ki Pauri, Parmath Niketan and Triveni Ghat. By far this is the best and not to be missed.For a small fee of Rs 300/- each family can participate in the pooja. Receipts are given for this payment and the priests perform the pooja as per the family gotra and details very diligently. The entire arati lasts for about 30 min , this is in addition to the personalised poojas which last for about 10 min. There is nice seating on concrete steps so all can be seated comfortably.At the end of the arati, there is a live bhajan which happens...Even the arati is done live without a audio being played  in the background."
Unforgettable experience,The sound of this ceremony and others can be heard from the river banks. It is a nice place to walk in the daytime also. It is ever changing each walk down the ghat is a new experience.There is a different feel in the day and the night as well.
Peace,If you want to have relax & peace in Ganges the. You should attend evening Arti at this Ghat.. Holy place..
Lovable place,It's a peaceful and serene place ever i visited. Such a lovely marine drive. Silence love freedom beauty water... Such more incredible things here... I like to go their whenever I have time.
All about faith,An event worth visiting and watching once. When we were there in Dec - the water flow at Triveni ghat was less. The one negative point in my observation was that the priests were doing the aarti like a parade regime - more for the spectators and less for their own worshipping!  Could not see faith and feelings in their action!
Serene.Devine.Best of Rishikesh.,You can't simply miss it in Rishikesh as it stands out as no 1 activity to do in the list.Nicely organized.great experience.
Amazing,"This is just amazing to see, a must go if you are in Rishikesh. The way the men handle the fire is just wow."
Triveni ghat ,The Ganga aarti performed here in the evening is a different level altogether. The lights and the music make you go in a state of trance.
The Best of All the Evening Ganga Aarti's.,"It's seems the every city now has an evening aarti on the river, but this is the real deal. Sit straight across the river and it's only about 50 ft. to the pooja. You might want to bring a small seat of pad to be comfortable."
Spiritual Tour,Its my second visit. Very peaceful and lovely ghat in rishikesh. Cool Calm. Everyone must visit.....
Enjoyed ganga aarti,Evening aarti from har ki paudi is quite crowded but if you really want to enjoy this ritual you should go to this place..
wrongly hyped place,there is nothing special about this place. it seems just a marketing strategy to lure tourist. one can easily avoid visiting this place. ganga aarti is mush better in haridwar.
Good experience,"Good experience to view Ganga Arti at Triveni Ghat... Being winter season, the Arti takes place at around 5:45pm..."
Ganga Aarthi performed like a devotional dance,Chanting of mantras and artistic performance of puja creates a  divine experience. Good combination of personal touch and comfortable viewing experience.
"Majestic, Awesome and fascinating","The Aura of Evening Ganga Aarti was majestic and fascinating. The music, the chores, the enthusiasm, the chanting bells, the method of Aarti just make you feel lost into spirituality."
The best aarti,"Ganga aarti at Triveni ghat Rishikesh is nuch better than ""har ki Paudi"" at Haridwar. Much better organised, less crowded, nice music, pandits on platforms performing aarti. Everything is very serene. Ram dhun and bhajans music follows after aarti and it creates an atmosphere where a person tends to be lost in trance."
If you want to enjoy Evening Aarti of Mother Ganga - go. To Triveni Ghat,"Evening Aarti at Har-ki- Paudi is quite crowed but if you really want to enjoy this ritual- you should go to Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh. It is really mesmerising. Around 15 Priests do the evening Aarti in a well synchronised manner along with well tuned rhymes & bhajans after the Aarti, it is an enthralling experience which is difficult to forget"
Amazing aarti,The aarti here every night at sunset is spectacular. The musicians were great and the chanting inspiring. The visual ritual of the monks with fire ceremony needs to be seen.
Highly spiritual and soul filling...,"If you're in Rishikesh, on your own spiritual journey,  soul searching, then attending Aarti at Triveni is a must! I was so touched, and felt so emotional that i went again the next day... And for photographers, it is a delight, as you can get quite close to the action.You will not be disappointed."
"Serene Ghat, Aarti with a personal touch",We found Parmarth Niketan Ghat a bit over rated. If you are looking for a peaceful place to experience aarti then Triveni Ghat is the place for you
Must watch,A must watch spectacle at Rishikesh. Ganga Aarti start at 6 PM and it is simply amazing. Go prepared to spend about half hour and get mesmerised by the aarti.
Nice ganga aarti,Visited here for morning and evening and enjoyed gangs aarti ceremony in evening . nice bank of river .shopping areas .
Amazing experience,"It's was amazing experience, must visit Triveni ghat. Paid 300 RS and performed puja at ghat. Pandit perform all the puja and you can do Aarti along with them. It's very organised. Peaceful and with less of crowd, you can actually feel the energy."
Worship of River ganges,It is one of the must to visit place in Rishikesh. The worship to river ganges by the form of Aarti is very beautiful. They also performs the bhajans at the area.
"A Bit Commercialized, But Worth The Experience","We came here during an evening walk on the riverside promenade and, although it is a very orchestrated, structured Aarti, it still lends itself to being a very spiritual experience. Leave your shoes with the security (a tip is expected), enter the fenced in area (there is also an unfenced area where you don't need to remove your shoes, but has no seating) take a few pictures, and then you are ushered to carpeted, cement steps amongst the many, many people who have come here to pray at this lovely site on the Ganga. Drummers and bell ringers, all dressed exactly the same, step up onto raised platforms in a synchronized manner, and then devotees who have either brought or purchased their offerings of oil lamps and flowers on leaf boats can place them in the holy waters. Please note that, in the plaza at Triveni Ghat, there are a large number of people who ask for food and money. I have been told that people in the area always donate to them because it is blessing to help someone in need. It is your choice, though. You can also visit the evening market/shops that are right next to the ghat and where you will find local folks looking for the same bargains as you are."
beautiful Ganga Aarti.,"You should visit this place in the evening time to watch the beautiful Ganga Aarti. The feeling is mesmerizing. There is a paid parking place near here, hence you can drive your car and park it near to the ghat."
Loved the Ganga Aarti ,The evening Ganga Aarti at Triveni ghat is one not to be missed.One can even get the individual prayer done before the Aarti
Ultimate ,One of The Best Experience  Of Oir Life noe we understand  about Hinduism and More about India as well
Beautiful,A beautiful ceremony to attend.  I highly recommend this! It was a beautiful and sacred event to be a part of.  I am grateful for the experience!
Keep the Fire Burning .....,"Good for the simple Aarti , spectacle of an even , people come with clean intentions and most important its devoid of pundits . You would feel the energy in the air by mid way of the aarti which gives this place a different type of energy . Just sit , enjoy and feel the vibe ...."
Don't miss,Inspirational!  Every day they have the Aarti.  It is very special.  I tried to make it a few times.  Stay and soak it all in.
Very peaceful,The place is very peaceful and religious. It has good history attached to it. It can be experienced throughout the year
spiritual,must do.much better than haridwar.much cleaner.much organised.the chanting was synchronised.triveni is devoid of pundits and touts who bother u for money and personal pooja which we experienced in haridwar
Best Aarti than Haridwar,Triveni Ghat is less crowded silent Ghat in Rishikesh. A dozen of pandits perform Ganga Aarti. A spectacular view for half an hour. You can perform aarti yourself by paying some charges before it commences. Go there nearly an hour earlier to have best view. Don't forget to have some snacks in Bikaner restaurant on ghat as it offers delicious food.
Ganga aarti,ganga aarti is the biggest draw in the rishikesh region. It is a spectacular event which everybody should witness
It's a great place to see the Aarti ceremony.,"We went to see the Aarti ceremony, which begins shortly after the sunset.  It was one of the most magical moments.  The priests performing the aarti at the bank of river Ganges is mesmerising.  The colours, fragrances and atmosphere was great!  It was not very overcrowded and people were very friendly."
Most enchanting Aarti of Ganges ever witnessed,This is one of the most visited place at Rishikesh here in the evening at about 6-15 pm the ritual of the lovely Arti starts and ends by approximately at 7 pm. There is a stand where you can sit and watch the beautiful Aarti being conducted it is worth the time spent. It is the most divine Aarti seen by us.Wow
Serenity all over,I have attended many aartis at different ghats but the Aarti at triveni ghat was awesome. The Mantra Uchharan and synchronization by the pandits makes it mesmerized view. Worth watching. One feels calm and serenity like zen.
Religious,The Arti and the surrounding is so surreal. The evening Arti is magical lasts for 40 odd minutes in total.
magical place to watch Aarti ceremony,"This was my second Aarti ceremony that I attended in Rishikesh and by far the most preferred. It felt friendly, sharing a bonding experience with the locals."
Great ,See the real hindu ceremony with the locals and enjoy the magic it creates after take a walk through the local market
Lovely cerimony,This was a lifetime experience I had in India. Very beautiful Aarti ceremony where I could offer flowers to mother Ganges and also make part of the music and all the energy around it.
Enjoyed ganga aarti,Visited here during Rishikesh stay and visit here for Ganga Aarti .nice location. Crowded but love the Aarti
Peace of life ,This is the most silent and peaceful place in the whole Rishikesh seen very crafty people's who flutters the heart love my religion Hinduism
Fantastic Ganaga Aarati,You will get devotion on Ganga. The bhajan group is awesome . Must visit place in Rishikesh . Time 5 PM to 6 PM everyday . There is a lassi shop nearby called Pappu Lassi Shop .It was a best lassi I ever tasted
Away from the maddening crowd,"If you have been to Haridwar aarti, then you will find the Triveni aarti to be very peaceful and soul touching. Its not very crowded and you can see the aarti clearly. But mind you, the ganga river is not as broad as it is in other places.I would recommend this anyone who goes with kids and wants to stay away from the maddening crowd at other ghats."
Amazing Cordination,"Excellent Ambience, Amzing to watch many pujaris doing aarti at a time. what a cordination and sync."
Divine connect on Ganga bank,"A must do thing when you visit Rishikesh is to witness the Ganga Arti that takes place every day from 06 to 06:30 pm. It‚Äôs done in a great atmosphere of religious ceremony and spiritual chanting. Does not matter which faith you follow, the experience will leave you enchanted and mesmerised. Take the blessings of the priests and the holy Ganges as you head back home"
Good place for holy dip,"This place is near Rishikesh. We went from haridwar which is about 1 hr from there, in normal traffic conditions. The ghat has cemented stairs with not so fast flowing waters as you see at hari ki paudi. Triveni ghat is very less crowded, but cleanliness needs improvement. Its actually the people visiting dirty the place with lot of things like flowers, prayer leaves and plastics. You can safely take a dip thou water is very cold. Car park is just at the ghat, though some taxi drivers will drop you at a place away from parking where you can descend via few stairs. If you have elderly people accompanying you, ask taxi to take u to the parking at the ghat. If you can walk then better to follow the stairs and save time"
Simply Mesmerizing,"An experience to remember - evening Ganga aarti at Triveni Ghat !!! The Ghat is also connected to the bustling streets where you can get food, clothes and anything you might need."
Loved the aarti and spending time in night,"The arti though not commercialized, but enjoyed the whole ambience. It is a good place also to sit and relax by dipping feet in the ganga."
Peaceful Ganga Aarti,"Far from the crazed mob of Haridwar, the Aarti at Triveni Ghat is ideal for the more spiritual sort. The timing is not fixed and not much information is shared with travellers. It is a wonderful experience and definitely an endorsed one."
Evening Collective Prayer,"Prayers every evening viewed by a large crowd is an experience not to be missed if you are in Rishikesh Uttarakhand in the northern part of India. At the foothills of the himalayas, on the banks of the Ganges river, it is a collective form of prayer lasting about 45 minutes. A treat for photographers/ videographers. A treat whether you are alone or in a group. Do not miss this if you are around there anytime of the year except maybe tge monsoon"
Awesome!!!**,Nice calming and relaxing weekend you should have hereThis place will wash out all your tirednessBe here
Best Aarti experience ,"In case you have only 1 evening in Rishikesh and you want to see the Aarti, this is your place. Reach there by 5.45 pm sharp and grab your seat. Only issue is it's location which is quite far from both Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula."
Super aarti,Aaarti in the evening is amazing. Very tranquil and spiritual by the river Ganga. A must if you are in Rishikesh.
Unique spiritual experience,"Arti started at 6.30 pm (pls check timings prior as we are told it varies depending on season). Good to arrive 30 min earlier. Prior to the visit here, we were concerned the place might be have a commercial tone (with suggestions for doing a puja or make an offering similar to some other religious places we had visited before)- here it was nothing of the sort. If you so wish, you can part sponsor the aarti but no pressure on that from anyone. Take your seat (on the footsteps to the Ghat) and enjoy the glorious aarati. The songs are melodious, sung live at the aarti place and not just a recording. Arti is for about 30 min, songs continue for another 30 min. It is a great spiritual experience. It is very blissful to witness the sun go down, aarti being lit, a few odd diyas the majestic Ganga river as it flows by.  It is something one must experience if in Rishikesh. There is no set dress code but good to be conservatively dressed to blend with the crowd and the mood. Take off your shoes at the shoe stand at the Arti place itself. We visited Triveni Ghat and not Parmarth Niketan based on suggestions from local friends that Triveni Ghat is more devout -ideally we would have liked to see both but very happy with the experience at Triveni Ghat."
Serene ,Ganga aarti at Triveni Ghat gives you a lot of peace. The best way is get there little early and get seated at the front seats as it gets busy by the time Aarti starts. It gives you a great peace of mind by attending the Aarti.
Awe inspiring aarti,The Triveni ghat aarti is one of the highlights of the Rishikesh trip. You have 16 pandits standing on pedestals and doing the aarti holding the aarti equipment which has is filled with oil and then set on fire. The evening aarti is a grand experience with the  chanting of the aarti and mantras. You can also immerse your own dronas in the Ganges as a prayer. Overall a must see for anybody going to Rishikesh.You feel very spiritually relaxed after this visit.
Holy place! ,"Triveni Ghat - The confluence of three holy rivers- Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati! We had a peace of mind when we visited this place! It was also not crowded! One can take his leisure time to venture this holy sight! Must visit place if you are in Rishikesh!"
Beautiful experience,"Awesome experience,  this is the must visit place in rishikesh specialy in evening time to attend the aarti"
Aarti experience ,"One can get the best Ganga ma Aarti experience here , one can book Aarti here , one of the best place to visit with family members ."
Mesmrizing!!,"go for an evening aarti ther, and watch ganga...beautiful diyas floating in the river..pay aarti to ganga and feel blessed"
Beautiful aarti ,"Triveni Ghat is a little away from Tapovan area, it's where we were staying so. Triveni Ghat is in Rishikesh Town area. Like every other Ghat , this Ghat also has Ganga Aarti every evening at sunset. We've seen a lot of Ganga Aartis in India but Triveni Ghat is our favorite. It was such a spiritual experience. The songs, the beats, the diyas. Everything was so mesmerizing. We felt truly blessed to have attended this aarti. According to me, the aarti here is a must visit"
Ganga aarti in rishikesh,"Ganga aarti at the triveni ghat is a very soothing experience, the chants sound almost otherworldly. Its a must do thing in the evening."
"""Holiest and purest Ghat of Goddess Ganga.""","A devine feeling of stepping inside the crystal clear water of Amma Ganga engulfes your soul and you will be feeling the oneness with the nature and you will again feel that you are inside the embrace of your mother. We visited in the morning, so missed Ganga Aarti, but next time we will surely plan to attend."
Ganga Aarti ,This is where the main Ganga Aarti happens in Rishikesh. Very serene place. Reasonably clean. Ganga Aarti every evening at sunset is well organised and is a event not to miss
Unique experience,There are a lot of tourists coming here but many are Indian tourists so you don't feel that sense of disney land. It feels authentic and spiritual in an honest way.
Triveni Ghat,Well maintained and spacious.Ganga aarti with chant of mantra is quite memorizing. Holistic place with great spiritual essence.
aarti,one gets a highly spiritual feeling during the evening aarti when there are mantras being chanted in front of the ganga.
Divine experience,A must for anyone visiting Rishikesh. Very divine experience. Place is kept neat and the rituals are beautiful to watch along with the music.
Mesmerising Arathi !!,"Visited Rishikesh after a long time and it has changed a lot ! Its Crowded too but there are few ashrams where you can stay peacefully,meditate & relax.Visited Triveni ghat for the evening arathi and we got to sit closely and watch the priests performing the Ganga arathi against the backdrop of the river gushing. It was indeed mesmerising to watch the arathi. Must visit when in Rishikesh."
good to bath,This is one of my famous ghat. Very good for bath. This ghat is approx. 3km from Ram Jhula. This place is not over crowded.
Good view,"As in Haridwar, evening Ganga Arati is performed at Triveni Ghat, Rishikesh. But we could not wait till evening to watch it. A cool view of the Ganges from this ghat. It is one of the attractions of Rishikesh."
Serene and holistic,"The people managing the place are polite and helpful. The Aarti is mesmerizing. The sound, music, view all take you to a different world altogether."
calm and quite ghat,"Good and safe ghat to take bath, many temples are nearby. Ganga arti is add on attraction. Take a dip and must attend ganga arti."
most relaxing religious  practice to visualize and feel,its a must if you are here . The aarti within itself carries so much of energetic vibes that make you feel a part of mother nature <3
Must see,"The aarti (sunset ceremony) is absolutely beautiful. The market around it has amazing stuff sooo cheap. Very Indian, very busy, just great."
Peaceful.,Atmosphere here is very peaceful. Visit this place specially at early morning to see sacred Ganga Aarti. Place is divinely great.
Sitting among locals made the ceremony more respectful.,"We attended 2 aarti. First time in Parmath Niketan, near Ram Jhula. Full of foreigners dancing. Felt so weird.The second time, it was here at Triveni Ghat. i sat among locals who chanted and sang along the music, with respectful minds. Even little kids like 3 years old sat clapping their hands. Before the ceremony, just hang around the ghat or the market nearby."
A mesmerising experience,"One must visit Triveni Ghat during the sunset, evening view here is awesome and the evening Aarti is worth watching."
Amazing experience,Attended evening aarti at Triveni ghat...Neat and clean.. Fantastic atmosphere and most beautiful music next to the strong flowing Ganga.. Excellent start to our trip into the Himalayas.. Thank you for a surreal experience!
Amazing Ghat on the Ganges.  ,The Aarti here is very special.  During the monsoon season it‚Äôs not as crowded so you have a much better experience of the Ghat from not being crowded.    The river is very nasty right now though.
Great Experience,Amazing place at night with the Ganga Arti ceremony.  Fantastic atmosphere.  It is worth the trip to go to Rishikesh  just for this let alone seeing the Ganga
Best place in the evening,A wonderful place to be visited after the fall of sun.The landscape of mountain and river is mesmerising.You can even converse with the Sadhus if you have blissful intentions.To medidate and levitate.
Ganga Aarti,A must do if you are visiting Rishikesh.  The Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat is one of the better and cleaner ghats to visit. It is also not as packed as the one in Haridwar. U can also dip your feet in the water however be careful as the flow is quite powerful.It is advisable to arrive approx 30 mins early before sunset to occupy your seat so that you can enjoy the Ganga Aarti. It is well coordinated and choreographed and worth seeing.After the Aarti is over you can offer flowers with camphor to the Ganga which are sold by children near the ghat area.
Arti by the Ganges,Most amazing Arti / Hindu religious prayers. Clean and fabulous.lifetime experience. The river bank / ghat has been very well developed. A must see.
Ganga artib,"We were group of 8 peoples, Came from different part of world, Thanks to guide (sorry I forget her name)From shiv Shakti hostel to show us this fabulous aarti."
The Mighty Ganges...Simply amazing...,"There is only one word Amazing, The best time to visit is early morning when there is view of mist surrounding the river. Ghat is clean and well maintained. The view of the mighty hanges along the ghat will take your breath away. Take the holy dip worship the sun and feel the peace.Looking forward to visit again."
One of the cleanest Ghats of Holy Ganga ,"Went to witness grand Ganga Aarti, which was truly mesmerising.I found, It as one of the best and the cleanest ghats for taking a dip in Holy Ganga.Water was not that deep; however flow was quite powerful.Jai maa Gange !!"
Simply Mersmerizing !!!,"If there's one place you must visit after the other popular attractions of Rishikesh, its the mermerizing evening Ganga Aarti @ Triveni Ghat. Occupy your seat atleast 30 minutes in advance, to enjoy the approx 30 mins spiritual journey.The well coordinated aarti is almost as if its divinely choreographed. A must experience atleast once in your lifetime."
Beautiful View at Triveni Ghat,Triveni Ghat is one of the most famous Ghat & the view of Maa Ganga River is really beautiful with hills. This is really a amazing Ghat to view natural beautiful. And Morning or evening Aarati is totally unmissable.
Ananding,"I have witnessed Ganga Aarti at Har ki Pauri, Haridwar many a time, but Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat, Rishikesh is quite different, enjoyable and amazing.  The post aarti bhajan recital by a local group is truly lovely and dance by people and foreigners a treat to watch.  If you are in Rishikesh must watch this.  Also, the area is more clean probably because of less footfalls."
Simply Amazing. Better than Har Ki Pauri,"The arathi is a must see. The arathi is so peaceful but powerful visual. 16 priests do the arathi according to the devotional songs played. A large tent is setup for the devotees to sit and watch the amazing performance. Not sure if its a daily performance, but when we were there, we had the opportunity to listen to a live concert and dance performance. The whole performance lasts for about an hour."
Pure bliss,"Best time to visit is sunset time (just google local sunset time). On 8/July/2018, Aarti started at about 7.30pm.Beware of pickpockets."
One of the main Aartis in Rishikesh,"This is one of the most (if not the most) important Aarti that happens in Rishikesh. Bring your beliefs and be blessed by this traditional ceremony by the banks of the Ganga River. It usually starts around 6PM, but the schedule may vary depending on the season. Arrive earlier to get an excellent spot to enjoy the music and the ceremony."
Perfect Puja,"Incredible experience to feel the energy of this worship, such devotion.  Even if I didn't understand the words, I understood the mood.  Purely blissful mixed with chanting over a loud PA system and fire offerings.  A unique and wonderful experience."
Do not miss,"This is a fantastic sundown ritual where people travel on pilgrimage - fire ceremony, music and chanting. Quite elaborate. Highly recommend. Similar Ceremonies in other local locations on the Ganges."
Surreal ,"Watching the Aarti or Maha Aarti performed at Triveni Ghat is one of the ""must dos"" of Rishikesh. The Ghat itself holds great importance as it is the confluence of 3 rivers i.e. Ganga, Yamuna and  Saraswati and it is here that they merge and form the Ganga, which goes on to flow into the IndoGangentic Planes. The Aarti is performed twice a day, at sunrise and sunset and therefore the timing for the Aarti changes during the summer and winter. I happened to witness the evening Aarti during the summer and the same started around 7p.m.  It is advisable to be at the Ghat about an hour prior to the commencement of the Aarti, in order to get a decent place to watch the Aarti. The Ghat is always abuzz with activity so an hour at the Ghat  passes really quickly. The sweet and salty lemon tea by the Ghat is not to be missed! Alsot to get good shots of the Aarti it is advisable to sit outside the slightly bounded area cordoned off by the officials for people who watch the Aarti. This way, you get a great view of the Pujaris and the entire crowd watching the Aarti."
