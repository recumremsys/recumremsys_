Such beautiful grounds!,The lawns and trees around memorial are so beautifully kept. All staff very pleasant and helpful and clearly love working there. Very interesting and clean modern facilities. Good to see so many families enjoying a day out.
Visited with the kids (2 & 5),"Great set up, got to enjoy about half of it before my kids got too annoying. Very modern museum with interactive displays giving you more detail than normal on the pieces. Be sure to book in advance noting that there are seperate bookings required for the 2 different parts of the museum.…"
Fantastic,We stayed there three hours but could have stayed much longer. They were moving us on. Some of the video displays were amazing. We loved it. Very COVID aware too. 
Fabulous ,What an excellent display of Australian involvement in war. Tasteful exhibits that are extensive. A great educational place to visit. Make sure you leave lots of time to visit. There is so much to see!
Always enjoy visiting when in Canberra.,"Have been here a number of times and always learn something new.  Spent most of this visit in the WW II  section. Great exhibits and well documented. Friendly and respectful staff. However, you need to plan ahead at present as limited numbers are allowed in during Covid restrictions.…"
Such an emotional experience,"I have visited many times but discover something new every time. At the moment, with Covid safe plans in place, you must book a time slot to visit the main part of the memorial and another time slot to visit ANZAC hall, a must see."
Si much to see,Well set out and a few lifts but could do with better signage for disabilities.Prebook a time before arrival.Well presented
Booked out online but we managed to get in at the entrance.,"The memorial is fantastic as many other reviews have noted.  Entrance is free.During Covid places are limited and when we looked online on the morning of our proposed visit there were no online places left, it was totally booked out (unlike every other attraction in Canberra where there seemed to be plenty of availability).I was really disappointed but my husband suggested that we just turn up and try to get in.  We did this and managed to get in - apparently they leave some spaces available for people who turn up at the entrance without an online booking.  So it may be worth trying this if you can’t secure an online ticket."
Exceptional!!,This is a MUST do in Canberra. We will definitely come again. Very well researched and presented. Exceptional!
5 Star Attraction,"If you go to Canberra this is a must visit. Expertly presented memorabilia from across all wars Australia has served in. Different types of displays and all very authentic. We had three hours, but if you really wanted to look at everything in detail you'd need 3 days. Great staff. The whole museum is spotless and meticulously maintained. You can't help be impressed."
Good one,Yes its my dream to watch these when i arrived Australia.So much of things to watch out.really impressed.clean and peace atmosphere
"Restrictions, but still top class","Great X 10. How anyone can visit here and not be impressed would be Beyond comprehension. Staff-great, Exhibits-great, Atmosphere-great, Overall-excelent"
Informative and moving,"We got two hour tickets at the end of the day so we could go straight to the Last Post ceremony, but we struggled to see everything in the museum in two hours! There was so much in there and would recommend at least 3 hours if you like to stop and read! Then the Last Post ceremony was so beautiful! We didn’t know what to expect but they do a tribute every day to someone who served in a war, and it was very moving and emotional. Very very well done and highly recommend going to that. Also - the staff were some of the friendliest and helpful out of everywhere we went in Canberra (and that was hard to beat)!"
Emotional Experience!,Emotional and Moving visit to AWM.COULD spend all day but only had timed 2 hour visits due to COVID 19.Some of the displays are a little tired but the touch screen displays are very informative and we were given a stylus each to use so we didn’t have to touch the screen with our fingers.Overall emotional experience and a touching tribute to honour our war heroes and Australia’s involvement in war.
moving & emotional ,Even with covid the 2 x 2 hour restrictions on visits & numbers allowed enough time to really absorb the displays and gave an intimate feel thoughout the museum.
Great to visit alone....or at least with no kids,Have been here multiple times as a kid and then with my kids. Had a spare day on a trip to Canberra and went by myself. They have gone above and beyond being Covid safe and by yourself is definitely the best way to visit this fantastic institution.
Truly memorable experience ,We attended the Last Post Ceremony with our 2 children and it was a very moving service. Our children were invited to lay a wreath throughout the ceremony which was very special. The Ceremony goes for about 20 minutes so is great for kids. Highly recommend.
Must include in your itinerary even just a day trip,"My husband and I did a day trip to Canberra and spent just over 2 hours here. Was absolutely worth it, would be great for families and larger groups aswell. Would absolutely come back!"
""" Not only for history buffs""","Even though some sections were not open for viewing due to Covid restrictions, it was still a very worthwhile visit. One in our party had never been to the AWW so he found the current 2 hour limit per visit a tad short so  he was disappointed having had to skip over some sections. The detail is phenomenal and it gives one a very realistic experience of the wars Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen have been involved in.Don't miss a visit - it is worth the time and effort to get there from Sydney."
A must do if in the area,Visited here with my kids for the first time in over 25 years. This place is remarkable and well presented. Its a must do if visiting the area and is free of charge.
Well Worth A Look,"I've visited the AWM a few times over the past decades and each time, I've been impressed with the detail and representation of our involvement in each conflict around the globe. The depictions are fact-based but they do conjure up emotions of the carnage and ravages of war that so many countless have to pay the ultimate price for.All the exhibitions are well illustrated and presented.  Worth a visit if you've never been there."
Extensive detail on Australia's war involvement,"It had been probably 15 years since I last visited here, and while many museums are closed but to Covid, the AWM is one of the few still open. Social distancing & hand sanitisier is done well, although everyone must book online now. I checked the night before and all bookings were taken from 10am to 12:30pm, so book 1 or 2 days in advance for the time you want to visit.There's sections for all wars that Australia was involved in, and certainly enough to see to fill 1 to 2 hours, mostly physical artefacts, only a small amount of audiovisual.My main interest is World War II and they have a fair range of information on Australia's role in Europe and Asia. I've been to WWII museums in Europe which are much more extensive, but this covered it pretty well.Spend a few minutes seeing the outside areas as well, especially the unknown soldier, it's rewarding.At the time of this review, the AWM director was considering a multi-million dollar upgrade. It doesn't need it, it's great as is. As has been said, any extra funding should go to war veterans who desperately need it and are certainly not getting the same level of funding as the war memorial."
Deeply moving.,"It’s a great museum, deeply moving, yet not moody or maudlin. And definitely not glorifying war as some say. Plenty of modern touches, educational, great staff.  The tomb of the Australian Unknown Soldier is beautiful."
Could've spent hours here!,"The War Memorial is amazing!  From the great grounds outside to the thoughtful displays inside. Due to Covid-19 you do need to book ahead, although we were lucky arriving late on a Thursday afternoon (about 3pm) and were able to get tickets at the door but I would highly recommend booking in advance! Particularly if visiting on a weekend/long weekend. All precautions are being taken from providing personal details at the door, constant cleaning of high touch areas, a stylus being given to use throughout the museum to use on touch screens and staff visible everywhere.I could've stayed a lot longer but had a restless 6 year old. If visiting with small kids you don't need more than 1-1.5 hours. If visiting child free then give yourself as much time as possible as there's a lot to see!"
Excellent presentation and display of history,Really well presented and detailed. So much to see and learn! Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We had to book due to Covid restrictions and that was really well handled and we felt the numbers were sensible and the place very clean. It was a 2 hour time slot which was enough for one day but would need to go back to see everything properly. Highly recommend.
Very engaging experience,We did two trips to the Warm Memorial on our recent trip to Canberra - once for the excellent Last Post ceremony in the evening and again the next day for the Anzac Gallery. Our 8 and 10 year children enjoyed it very much and would have like to have stayed longer (We were on timed tickets due to restrictions put in place for COVID) and both commented on how much they learnt about Australia’s war history. The exhibits are very well done and we look forward to visiting again.
Australian War Memorial COVID-19,This place is amazing and we wanted to see it again. However with COVID-19 we didn't check and found that you had to book online a time to access the whole or parts of the memorial.So next time we will be better prepared. This will apply to a number of exhibits etc in Canberra
Anzac Galleries were excellent ,"Booked ahead with COVID arrangements and they had processes sorted. Anzac gallery has large planes, subs, and multimedia screens so it was the perfect 50 min timed ticket for visiting with kids (aged 3-8). The video presentations were engaging with surround lighting and sound, and not too scary for kids if you talked them through it. Great to see uniforms, medals and original air craft and a very special opportunity to understand thier great-Grandfathers war service. Would highly recommend on your visit to Canberra with kids."
Not to be forgotten,"An experience not to be forgotten, very informative and educational.  The timed entry during COVID 19 restrictions was well organised.  We will certainly visit again as we couldn’t see all areas during lockdown due to having to book ahead."
Great day,We were there for the first opening since Covert 19 started.  If you like war history this place is amazing and very moving in some parts. Will take at least a whole day to take it in. There is a good cafe there for lunch. Well worth a visit
Awesome,The War Memorial reopened on Wednesday 1st July though a ticket system and it was excellently done.  Lots of staff on hand to give directions and make sure you stayed on the paths.  I borrowed a wheelchair as I was unable to walk around for the 2 hours and the staff were very helpful.  Brendan Nelson has done a wonderful job in the last few years and this War Memorial is a highlight in Canberra and all of Australia.  Well done.
Fabulous place to visit,"We could have spent all day here, but due to social distancing, we had 3 hours. It was long enough to see most of it, but if you wanted to read all the information it would take at least 2 visits"
An amazing experience for history lovers,"I was impressed before I even entered the building, then when inside there are some incredible displays, where you can re-live what past wars would have been like for the brave men and women who served in our military services."
Impressive,Travel to history of war Australia. Well designed building and wide area to visit. Everyone must see this place.
A must see Austalian Icon,The curators at the AWM should be congratulated for maintaining this national treasure in exemplary fashion! You get a sense of pride when you walk through the AWM. A MUST SEE attraction in Canberra!
A Must See in Canberra,"This is a sobering place to visit as so much we take for granted is due to the sacrifice of many young men and women in the past.The work done on displays and provision of information is outstanding. The security on the building is good. It has a cafe for a cuppa and reflection. Allow yourself 3-4 hours to do it justice. The Long March was a sad event especially when you see the faces of all the young people who were forced into it. Excellent and a must see in Canberra. Last post is sounded 4.55pm. Opens at 10am. Get there by bus, taxi or uber. It's a long walk from the Mall."
What a fantatic and moving experience,"There is something for everyone here. A fantastic tribute to all the conflicts that Australia has been involved in. The quality and variety of the displays was brilliant.Allow about 4 hours or more for your visit as there is so much to see, both inside and out. There is also a good café onsite for a break to let your emotions settle down. This should be a 'must see' for all Australians."
A must see for all Australians and visitors,The breadth of displays and the thorough narration of Australian military history is moving and incredible
An amazing place - unlike anything else in the world,"The Australian War Memorial is a place for people that respects our servicemen and women. Amazing! It does not glorify war or victories, but honours the men and women."
Fantastic museum,So much to see here and a great tribute to all the wars and the soliders. The information that was with each display was so interesting and some of it fascinating. Loved watching the old footage that was showing. We spent about half a day here and probably could have spent a lot longer
"Excellent, probably the Daddy of all the War Museums in Australia, and there are a lot.","Great museum with a huge amount of items on show. If you are in Canberra for a few days, go to the museum a few hours at a time, or you'll be in danger of being Museumed out. Too much to see in one go."
Simply Beautiful....,"A must see in Canberra, so I did - It's free to enter just leave a donation - And 10 - 17H daily except Xmas day.It's so well laid out and there are always staff on hand to help should you need it.I jut wandered around reading all the data plaques and really enjoyed my time, ever corner I turned there was another room, hall, area to see!It;s so well laid out and I have to say I was there 3 hours and could have spent longer.Credit to the organizers and staff who were supporting this on the Sunday I visited...Loved every minute and highly recommend"
A must-see,"Such an amazing place, the museum area was so much larger than expected and had so much info, very interesting. We were especially interested in the areas relating to more recent wars, a real eye-opener. There were no tours running due to the Coronavirus, but we were able to hire some audio guided tours for $10 each which were handy to have. There’s even a research centre here so you can look up any family members that may have served, and see any recorded documents about them. The war memorial itself is beautiful. It’s sad that it’s being closed for the time being due to the current situation, we would highly recommend a visit, and would love to come back for a guided tour at a later date. We spent about half a day here but could have stayed for even longer, there’s so much to see."
Fantastic experience,"Information is easily accessible, vivid and well-organised. Deeply moving and informative experience."
It is huge and a great tribute to fallen ANZAC's,"This is a must see, we only spent 4 hours and will need to go back again. There is a ceremony at 4:55pm each day, it is so moving it will bring a tear to a glass eye. The staff were brilliant, willing to answer questions and help in anyway. There is a small shop with many mementos, take home a small hand knitted poppy to remind you of the sacrifice paid by these great Australians. They will be doing renovations/extensions come June/July, which will shut down some of the exhibitions.This is a free exhibition but donations are gratefully accepted."
Outstanding ,"Absolutely sensational. One of the best museums I’ve ever been to. High quality items, comprehensive reading and there’s a lot of it. An outstanding memorial with some fantastic features."
Visit,"If you have time to look at the Mall approach and the museum and the unknown soldier, plus the last post, this is a very moving experience. I would suggest a minimum 4 hours. the no.59 bus takes you there or a 40min walk from the centre."
REally interesting and informative,I really like the setup and the information given on the different wars provided.  The walk up Anzac Parade is also very pleasant
Lovely visit especially when taking time to explore ,Despite some areas being refurbished and some signage being difficult to follow. I had a wonderful time exploring the AWM and enjoying many talks and performances.The staff are helpful and friendly.
A credit to our servicemen ,Visit every few years - always different - always vibrant. Staff are amazing directing patrons to the best of the exhibitions
Interesting Visit  ~ Great Displays,"We visited here twice during our trip to Canberra, as it is very interesting with great displays of all the wars.  I was there to see my Great-grandfathers name on the Roll of Honour and lay a poppy.Good cafes on site as well and very helpful staff if you have any questions or needed guidance.  They do have organised tours as wellFree entry any they do security checks on entry.  Well worth a visit"
Every Australian needs to visit,"One of Australia's greatest treasures and a must on every visit to Canberra, as one visit will just not cover it all. We spent a long time in the recent Afghanistan section which was very moving indeed and provided a great insight into what Aussie troops went through and still are going through, despite what we hear in the news. The sound and light displays are good and also provide an insight into events of the past. Makes one grateful for everything every Aussie digger has gone through in conflicts of the past, to ensure our freedoms - Lest we forget."
Here is a must do for all Aussies (and visitors),"Bringing the stories of our military involvement to life  allows us to recognise and honour all servicemen.  The Lost Post Ceremony, daily at 4.55, is sadly moving and certainly a great way to finish a visit to this Memorial."
A MUST visit,So well laid out. Staff so helpful. Free tour excellent. Plenty of seats to rest and relax. When you think you have finished you find more areas to investigate. Grounds are lovely
Absolutely amazing place.,My husband and I weren’t too keen at first on going here because we don’t really enjoy most things war. We went with friends and did a remarkable tour with Tanya and we throughly enjoyed every minute of being there. We were there for four hours and cannot wait to go back. It has started a great desire to study Australian history and wars.
Amazing,"Can’t put into words how amazing this place is. From the gardens and statues to the exhibitions and galleries as well as the Honour Roll, Reflection Pool, Flame and Tomb. This place is absolutely a must see in Canberra"
Lest we Forget,This museum is a must to see for everyone.  So well presented and informative.  Makes you think about the brave people who were in a war.
"Memorial, not Museum","Educational, thought provoking. Please remember its a Memorial and not a Museum, so ensure that you are respectful"
Fascinating and fun to visit.,"The war memorial is situated with beautiful views to the lake and lovely grounds as well. The memorial itself has something for everyone and is suitable for even young kids if they don't watch the videos. They have a large interactive area where kids can 'fly' a helicopter and 'ride' in a submarine - fun for adults too. The floor space is enormous and all eras are beautifully presented with lots of information and exhibits, both large and small."
Solemn and respectful,"Everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime, it is the least we can do for the veterans and their families who have so much for us. A wonderful memorial for those lost at war."
So much to see at the War Memorial.,You can spend a couple of hours or more at the War Memorial. Our grandson looked at everything. Very interested in all the medals.
Great piece od history,"Amazingly presented piece of Australian military history. Highly interactive and with a great narrative, especially about WW1 and 2."
So much to see,"Still so much left to see, we had a great visit with a wonderful tour guide to get us started.   A Canberra must see experience. "
Don't Miss This,"This is both a memorial and topnotch museum set in a lovely location. The guided tour was 90 minutes and simply excellent. Moving stories of long lost soldiers and sailors who gave their lives in service of their country were recounted by the guide. Beautiful dioramas, exhibits…"
Family visit,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit, ensure you leave 3-4 hours to see everything. Parking was great. Guided tours available or make your own way through. "
Moving,We did the free tour with Peter and it was well worth the history lesson. Then we attended the last post event that i had seen as worthwhile being there for. We did the 2:30 guided tour ready for last post at 4:55. Possibly could of done with a bit more time .but still found it very worth the visit. Also went downstairs to records where you can look up relatives that have served.
Sobering but a wonderful place to visit - can do it quick - but could also spend a day there if you had the time ,Spend as much or as little time here - free entry with a donation option. Cafe onsite - lots to see .
Excellent Museum,Our guide Henry had so much knowledge which gave us a better understanding of Australian War participation & history
"awesome, magnificent displays. really concentious knowlegeble staff","everything you ever wanted to know, wonderful indigenous departmentloved every moment there, we are returning there this year to do more research"
Must Do...,Attended the Last Post ceremony at the Australian War Memorial. Held at closing around 4.45pm each night it is a very moving experience & a must do for every Australian. Wreaths are laid by school children & a fallen soldier’s story is told as part of the ceremony. The last post makes the hairs stand up on your neck & is a special moment.
Respect,Great museum. I feel they should really charge and give the profits back into the coffers for ex servicemen. We took a tour with a volunteer guide. It was excellent. Proud to be an Ozzy.
Every Australian needs to visit the AWM,"Wonderful displays of wars Australians have been involved in, peace keeping and current Afghanistan deployment. Starting outside to see the Bushmaster our troops travel in. Statues including of course Simpson and his Donkey. The names of all soldiers killed surrounding the pool of remembrance a reminder of the number of lives impacted by war. There are tours throughout the day or you can wander the displays at your own leisure. There are plenty of staff on hand for information and directions. Stay for the 5pm Last Post ceremony where details of a soldier, and how that soldier died in war,  are read to the gathered crowd. A fitting end to a day spent at the Memorial."
A must go!,"My friend and I visited the war museum in Canberra whilst on our travels around Australia. We arrived just in time for a 90 minute tour. ( I think there are a few throughout the day)A lady named Amita was our guide and was amazing! So informative, friendly and spoke with a real passion.We were so impressed that the tour and entry to the museum was free of charge as the building and grounds were  impressive and the amount of information and artifacts on display was excellent. Would highly reccomend when passing through Canberra. Thank you again Amita :)"
Historical & Informative,The best place I have ever visited so far in Canberra.Too many things to see.I can spend whole day just stay in here.
Not a museum a memorial,"Take a free tour and check out the library. There is so much to see here, including the wallaby’s on the hillside behind. Take a long walk to see all the memorials and then dig into the history, if that’s your thing. Don’t miss the sculptures outside to the right of the main building"
One of the best in the world of ANY Museum,"We visited here in 2018, went twice and still ran out of time to see everything. So on this second trip to Australia we specifically made a detour to Canberra to see it again. Visited 3 days in a row spending a total of about 10 hours here and STILL didn’t see everything. On the third day we took the 90 minute free tour with Jeff. ( not sure if that’s the correct spelling but he was originally from Dublin) who was an excellent volunteer guide and really helped to enhance our visit. I’ve been a professional guide back in England for 35 years so I do know what I’m talking about. Never once did he sound like he was speaking from a script or saying something for the hundredth time. The museum covers over 100 years of war in a fascinating and personalised way and uses a lot of human stories to Stoke your interest. Very good use of modern technology to illustrate complex battles. I could go on and on. This is truly a magnificent world class museum (far superior to the displays at the Imperial War Museum in London ) and a very moving memorial. Do not go to Canberra without visiting it."
Amazing ,Not being from here this is amazing and worth the time I could have done 2-3 more days here. Great cultural and historical information about an great country.
Excellent Musuem,"Brilliant display of War History, we spent all day, wandering through the awesome displays, and finished with the very solemn ceremony of the last post,"
Freedom isn’t free,This is a great visual monument with a wonderful museum below. The red poppies which are abundant make a great visual that blood is shed for our freedoms we enjoy today. The Last Post verminous really wonderful to attend. The bagpipes are amazing and the bugle call is quite moving.   They have a very nice gift shop but restrooms. Facility has an elevator so is handicap accessible. The monument architecture is quite stunning both inside and out. The names of all who have been lost are alphabetical by campaign. I highly recommend this beautiful reminder of those you have given their life for freedom.
Make sure you give yourself a full day,"We only arrived 1pm and did not get through everything. All of our conflicts are covered, including Vietnam, Korea and Afghanistan."
Very emotional but a Must Visit venue,"We arrived half an hour prior to opening and had a great breakfast in the relatively new cafe on site.  There were several TV's in the cafe playing the story of the return of the forgotten soldier - and my poor wife was tearing up watching it.  We walked in and were swamped by the staff - offering a 1.5 hour free tour (which are run every half hour).  Our guide was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and provided a great oversight of what was there to see.  It is so very sad to get a better understanding of what our forebears went through - on all sides of the conflicts.  But please go and give yourself all day."
A must visit place in Canberra,Upon hearing the name I thought this would be like any other typical war site location where they would show guns and weapons with underground tunnels that were used during world war. But I was glad that I was wrong. The building from the outside looks random. But it actually contains like a small world within itself. I am glad that I actually went to this place. The audio effects gives goosebumps of how actually the soldiers fought in different climates and weather condition. One could easily get lost in this place.
Canberra visit,An awe inspiring visit into the making of this country. Many exhibits detail the exploits of our many service personnel throughout our nations development. some of the exhibits can be confronting to many people from all nations. My wife and I were able to understand more for our family tree as a result of our visit.
Very impressive Memorial and so much to see....,It is easy to spend the day at the memorial going from one venue to another and have a lunch at their outdoor/indoor restaurant.
Lest we forget,Beautiful building with amazing view through to Parliament House. The displays and some of the detail is amazing. No part of Australian service has gone missed in this must see Australian History building.We will remember them
BEST museum EVER!,"I actually had no interest in going to a War Memorial because I do not believe in war. I had friends in town, however; and I thought it would be a nice addition to their visit to Canberra (especially since there are not many things to do in Canberra). This was one of, if not the, most amazing museum I've ever had the opportunity to visit. The ""memorial"" title is a bit misleading. It is so much more than than a memorial. The way the information is presented is awesome. The memorial and museum are both beautifully constructed. I would suggest visiting to anyone looking for something interesting to do while in Canberra."
Interesting and Informative,"I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to the war memorial. It was very clearly laid out, and there was lots of information about each of the displays. I learned a lot about Australia and its participation in war and peace keeping deals. I would fully recommend a visit here!"
Veteran Service Member Any Patriot Must visit ,"This memorial is essential to understand the sacrifice and strength of the Australian people and the role this nation has played in shaping history. Beautiful- clean and poignant, the solemn reverence and serenity wraps around you, shows you all side of war and it’s cost to retain freedoms gifts for our homelands. Fabulous book and gift store, quiet study research area, easy tours to learn from friendly and knowledgeable guides. Take 10 minutes or 5 hours-  leave a poppy to remember and respect. This old U.S. Comrade salutes these hero’s and those who created this tribute."
thoughtful and beautifully serene,"On holiday form the UK and spending time with family in Canberra. Very moving experience - lots to see and digest in a very calm, serene setting. Moving displays as well as educational. Could have spent much longer here. Well thought out and designed. Certainly worth a visit Cafe good also ............................................................."
Free tour,"Amazing, could spend a couple of days here if you wanted! The free tour was great, our tour guide was so passionate about acknowledging the service of Australia men and women."
The best war memorial I've ever visited,"I'm from the U.S.visiting the ACT. This memorial is number 1 on many ""must see"" lists for a very good reason, it's one of the best in the world. It's truly both a memorial and a war museum with exhibits and artifacts from the Boer war to Afghanistan. It's truly touching that they exhibit pictures and stories from all Victoria Cross awardees and many Albert cross awardees. The icing on the cake is their last post ceremony everyday at 455 pm. It celebrates the service of one hero who died in service to their country. Truly an amazing place."
Do the tour,"The free public tour is the best way to visit this vast space. I personally have a problem with glorifying war, but I came away feeling that the memorial was not primarily about this. The displays are excellent and the narratives told by our guide were of great interest."
Excellent and informative,We were looking forward to our visit and certainly were not disappointed . We were offered a free guided tour by one of the volunteers Margaret.The tour took around 90 minutes and Margaret was so informative and pleasant.Would recommend spending a whole day exploring.Many thanks Margaret for such an informative and pleasant morning!
Nice place to visit,"Best placeThis is one of the best museums in Australia, for enlightening architecture in an exhilarating setting. Need more time to explore all the area, Will come back again: )"
Well worth the visit while in Canberra,"This attraction is one of the best exhibitions I have ever seen. You will need at least a full day to absorb everyhing on offer. Make sure you jump on a tour to begin with. This will give you an overview of what is on offer.A solemn reminder of Australia's contribution to world peace and the sacrifice of young men and women over the last 120 years.Great interactive exhibits. Tea, coffee and food is reasonably priced and the service of all staff is excellent. Don't miss it while in Canberra."
Amazing,"We have been here several times before, granted its been a few years, but ther eis so much of interesting stuff to see. You will run out of time prior to running out of things to see. We started with a 45 minute guided tour of the post 1945 exhibition. It was a great tour, lots of good information and post the tour we spent another 1.5 hrs going over the same area for parts that we did not see during the tour. We spent the remainder of the time in the aeroplanes areas which had a number of visual as well as pictural displays. very very enjoyable, I would recommend 2 to 3 days to see all."
Amazing Place,"We visited the war memorial with our kids during our stay in Canberra, I was delighted to see our rich history."
"Amazing, humbling place. Every Australian should visit","They’ve always done a great job with the memorial, take your family at least twice. So much amazing history"
Don’t pass this place up when you come to Canberra !!,"We visited the War Memorial and were amazed as to the detail and exhibits on show.The War Memorial opens from 10am and closes at 5.00pm.We did a free 90 min tour with a guide initially on arrival which went through the World War 1 and World War 2 exhibits to get an idea on what we should see and look at by ourselves.There are also shorter tours of 30 and 60 min duration of different sections of the War Memorial.All tours are free and there is a display on arrival of the various tours available.You do have the option to buy headphones and do a self guided tour which cost $10.The complex is amazing with the area covered over 3 levels. There are lifts and stairs available to get to various sections. There are several toilet amenities throughout the building and 2 food outlets - 1 inside and 1 outside with a good array of food choices.Their are many visitor guides who are placed throughout the Memorial who are very knowledgeable and willing to assist should you get lost or need directions to a particular area)The tour guides appear to be past serviceman who are also very knowledgeable and passionate in sharing their experiences.There are no entrance fees however you are able to offer a donation should you wish.Something to note is that large bags will be checked and searched before entering the venue and should you bring a backpack in you will be asked to not wear it over your shoulders to avoid hitting any of the statues or exhibits.The Memorial covers the Boar War, World War 1 and 2, Korean War and Vietnam War and Gulf and Afghanistan Wars and Peace Keeping Duties.There are aircrafts of many nationalities and tanks and guns and equipment used in war time.There are many war videos playing and memorabilia to look at throughout the complex.Upon entering the War Memorial on either side are the walls of remembrance for the past serviceman and women who have lost their lives during the various wars and peace keeping.There is a gift shop just before you exit for anything you may want to buy as a keepsake or a gift of your visit.You can spend as little or as long as you want going through the Memorial. We spent the whole day there and stayed for the last post which starts at 4.55pm each day where a fallen soldier is selected and remembered for their sacrifice made.The service is very moving with many visitors taking the time to stay and take in and pay their respects.We found the day amazing and learnt to appreciate more the sacrifices our past and present servicemen and women make to protect our country.The last post was a highlight of our visit.There is both outside and underground car parks available. The underground car park on a Monday to Friday are a 4 hour max parking and open early in the morning and close at 6pm."
Canberra flying visit,"This is well worth a look. The displays are incredible, well set out. You must stay for the daily reef laying, ours was for a raaf person who was killed in 1945, his twin sister laid the reef she was 100 on the day."
Very Moving experience,I love coming to the War Memorial . There is so much to see and i could spend Days in here reading all of the information they have . They almost bring the experiences to life and it is very moving . Every person needs to visit this Memorial . It is so well done .
Wonderful Memorial,This memorial evokes emotions of both sadness and gratitude. Sadness because of the number of people killed and the destruction during all the wars and gratitude because of those who gave their lives for our freedom.This is a wonderful memorial to remind us of the futility of wars.
Loved every second,So much to do. So much to see. So little time to explore everything that is in this wonderful place!
Needs more than half a day,"What an experience – from the free volunteer guide to the very moving Last Post ceremony, this was an absolutely first-class experience.Be prepared for something very different"
Breathtaking ,Absolutely must visit if you travel to Canberra. The museum is set up so well and extremely detailed. We went on a 90 minute tour and took so much out of it as well as attending their 4:55pm service at the end of the day. Very moving.
Canberra trip,Awesome walk through and guided session. The concierge Tennel was great and provided the information that made my day more informative
Fantastic ,Really love coming here and taking my time to look around and really take in every thing in the museum
One of the best museums in the world ,I have been to many museums and war memorials around the world and this is definitely one of the best: starting outside in the beautiful grounds through to the extremely well organised and beautifully presented exhibitions and light shows. Just outstanding!It’s so large it would take days to see everything. A good start is to jump onto one of the free 1.5 hour tours run by the extremely knowledgeable volunteers. Thanks to Gary for a great tour on Thursday.
If you only do one thing in Canberra.....,"I only left half a day spare at the end of my trip to visit the Australian War Memorial which is a shame because it easily warrants a full day at least. I underestimated the size of the memorial and the amount there was to see and do.There are great exhibits, interactive displays and guided tours, it was my most memorable, moving, interesting site visited in Canberra and a must see for anyone with an interest in history and to pay tribute to the thousands who have gone into service for their country."
Australian war memorial ,So much content!  Plan a full afternoon to explore many sections with a focus on Australia’s involvement. The grounds are pretty too.
Loved this place,We could have spent all day here really as there is so much to see.  We especially liked the aircraft section.  We took the free guided tour which gives you a good overview.  Both cafés were nice too so you could easily spend the whole day time permitting.
Huge and so much to see ,"Spent most of the day here - Canberra was blanketed with smoke so this was perfect. So much to see, make sure you have plenty of time. The cafe was good and we all thought it was a must see and do in Canberra."
war memorial,Beautiful place. The Australian war memorial is absolutely worth a visit. You can do both guided and self guided tours.I loved the pool of remembrance. Very unique.
Much more than I expected ,In Canberra for work. Thought I’d take a look. Wow. What an amazing informative place. It’s huge and really well done. Pay your respects.
Stay for the last post ceremony!,"It is a huge building with plenty of artefacts and explanations about the different conflicts Australia has been a part of (as allies, etc.) throughout history. There are plenty of guided tours provided in each section, though it really just scratches the surface of all that happened and the stories behind the artefacts displayed. Everything from tanks and weapons to the table they signed the surrender of Singapore to Japanese forces were all present.I appreciate how the soldiers were all well-appreciated and how the Memorial holds a Last Post Ceremony after they close, which lasts for about 10-15mins. Despite not knowing anyone who fought during the wars (I know some of my deceased relatives had been alive during war times), I still found the ceremony extremely meaningful and something worth observing should you happen to visit the memorial."
So much too see and very somber.,"It's very well maintained and the collections displayed are amazing. The stories of war are very touching and beyond comprehension at times. A must see. One thing to note, if you are visiting the room where the unknown soldier is, please be respectful and not take instagram/fashion-like poses of yourselves."
A must for all Aussies,Came in April for first visit & did the free tour.Revisited in December as we ran out or time on our first visit..Excellent exhibits that tell moving story's of our courageous  men & woman in past conflicts.
Must see,"Such a great place to visit. Take your family, friends or come by yourself and be amazed by the great sacrifice of our fallen heroes. I could easily spend hours here. There is plenty of parking and things to see."
Always a must see in Canberra,"A must-see attraction whenever you are in Canberra as there is always something different to take in, whether it is the large displays or the smallest item. The staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable while there are facilities near-to-hand to ensure that you are comfortable, even on an all-day stay. The facility is very respective of ALL who have taken part in conflicts. Particularly enjoy the stories of the heroes who carried out brave acts without any self-regard."
Beautiful Last Post Service,"We attended the War Memorial for a special Last Post Service for my husband's great uncle who was killed at Gallipoli, aged 22yrs. The staff were absolutely amazing in their organisation of the event, having to cope with a relocation of the event to the Anzac Hall due to the extremely poor air quality from the fires in NSW & Victoria.Every detail of the process was explained, the reading of the history of the serviceman and the chance to lay wreaths was amazing. A big thank you to all involved.The Memorial is an amazing place with so much on display to see that you need more than a day to see everything. A place that needs to be visited to pay respects to all those who have been invovled in conflict around the world."
Amazing. It is everything everyone says it is plus so much more. Make it a priority to see!,"Incredible. I wish I could rate it ten starts. Australia has done a brilliant job with this place. It's massive, respectful, and incredible in every detail. Truly world class. The entry is free (by donation - but worth it) - and the free tours that run every 30 mins are truly worthwhile and comprehensive. The tomb of the unknown soldier is breathtaking. The collection is exceptional and the staff are friendly and helpful. And don't forget the military records and family history library in the basement. You must see it! In retrospect, I'd have loved to have had more time here"
Excellent,A great museum with rather detailed and interesting exhibits. Could easily spend a four to five hours there. Certainly recommended if you are at Canberra.
This is our history,"Without the brave souls that are represented in this building, We would not have what we have today.You have to be prepared to spend the day here, go on the tours if you want or just take your time so soak up all that is Australia. We didn't start the fights, but we always stepped in when we were needed."
Last Post Ceremony,"The ceremony had been moved indoors due to the heat and smoke. It is well worth attending, 4:55 pm daily, and very moving."
Fantastic day,"What a nice surprise! Didn't realise what an amazing place this is. Spent about 5 hours here, immersed in history. Aircraft were amazing!"
Moving Experience ,An amazing experience and not to be missed if you visit Canberra. The last post was an amazing and moving experience that brought home the horror of war and the effect it still has for the family of a list soldier who gave his life such a long time ago in 1915. The displays were amazing and the staff extremely friendly. Not to miss.
Wonderful,A must go for young and teenage children. Such a good learning and amazing experience for all.  Lot of information about world war 1 and 2. A tribute to the gone soldiers. Just before closing time people gather at one place to pay the honour to the soldiers.
The #1 museum in Australia ,"This has got to be the best museum in Australia. I have been to every capital city in Australia and every state museum and nothing compares to this one. It had the most info on ww1 compared to other wars. The collection is quite impressive. I have been to many military museums around the world and in my opinion this one is the 5th best. The best military museum in the world is the one in Vienna, followed by london one, then Berlin although it is really part of the German history museum, then the one in Saigon."
An absolute must ,Not sure thus needs many words : it’s a total must. We dedicated two days as lots to see. It’s tiring as so much amazing information and displays: hence two half days to really enjoy it.
Tourism,Want to explore the country nature and wild life i have fall in love and i have persion in wild life
Incredible place,"This is a must visit place in Canberra to learn about the sacrifices made by Australians over the centuries. There is a guided tour which we missed, but it would be well worth it based on just my looking around the place. Plan to spend 1/2 a day here to really take in the entire grounds and the buildings"
Last post ceremony a moving end to a very worthwhile visit,"Bearing in mind the nature of the content of this memorial, probably a two hour visit is probably enough. If you were to try and see, read and take in all the pictures, mementos, relics, dioramas etc you may need a week. This is a truly wonderful memorial to human sacrifice. No visit is complete though without experiencing the last post ceremony at the approx 4.45. There is a moving recount of an individual war experience, wreath laying, the ode and a live performance of the last last post. All this is done around the reflection pool with the eternal flame, in front of the tomb of the unknown soldier. Entrance is free. Donation taken if you are inclined. Not really a place for of interest for children under eight"
The Best,"I have long wanted to visit the Australian War Memorial and Museum. It was at the top of the list when my husband and I recently holidayed in Canberra. It is an incredible place. We spent a full day looking around and then returned the next afternoon, there is just so much to see in the Museum. I would recommend to start your visit with a free guided tour and then go back and have a look around at your own pace. I would also recommend to stay for the Last Post ceremony. Very moving."
Great place to visit while in Canberra with kids,Definitely do walk around and wait until the end for the last post.  Clean and very well run.  Lots of see and a great exhibition.  We visited on a freezing cold Canberra day and was glad to visit.
Excellent war museum and memorial,"Ideally you would need a few days to fully explore the memorial as it has a very extensive war museum incorporated into the building. We went on one of their free tours which lasted 90 mins (some lasted 60 mins) which outlines the highlights of the memorial  including the pool of reflection, the roll of honour, the hall of remembrance and the galleries of the first and second world wars. There are also further galleries detailing recent conflicts and peacekeeping and a Discovery Zone especially for children (unfortunately this was closed on our visit due to school group visits from interstate, perhaps it is open during weekends). It is well worth planning your visit so you can stay for the last post ceremony at 4:55pm. We had foreign dignitaries at the ceremony for our visit. Please be aware that  the gift shop closes prior to the last post ceremony. Parking is free in the underground carpark."
Great museum and lesson on history ,We went here with our 7 and 5 yr old. Walking the names with them and explaining the significance was a great opportunity to teach them about history but also discuss the humanity of it. The museum was well planned and set out and had a great walking tour you could join. A tad too old for my children I think though. There is a service on in the afternoon most days where they honour someone who died in the war. Worth staying and experiencing.
Speechless,Spent 4hrs here and could have spent 4 more. A beautiful & touching tribute to our fallen soldiers. A must see experience!
Stopover,"Went here for a visit last weekend, I like coming back here because of all the history of the wars the Aussie were involved in. Looks like a lot of thought went into the displays about how it was like on the Battle fields plus all the other displays they have set up through the museum. And the cafe is good for a bit of relaxation since they have 2 one inside the other outside."
Most certainly the number 1 attraction in Canberra.,"I've visited the war memorial and museum on many occassions, and cannot recommend it highly enough. Allow 2-3 hours minimum as there's lots to see covering each conflict Australia has been involved in, including recent deployments, as well as piece keeping missions. The collection of aircraft is impressive. The Victoria Cross exhibit overwhelming. And the pool of reflection and war memorial very moving."
Visually appealing,"The displays and information are comprehensive. Children could appreciate the diaramas and models, including the full-size bomber and spitfire. Plenty of attendants are available for direction and there is plenty to see, as Australia's involvement in all wars since our young beginning is represented. I think if you had been in one of the wars, you could find it confronting, with pictures, audio and simulations that are actual or very realistic. The dome, remembering unnamed departed soldiers, is beautiful and artistically situated.It could be a long haul for young children."
Excellent,"Excellent, great architectural and exhibitionary display. Free parking on site. Great place to come with family"
An amazing place ... a must see for all Australians,"We went on a 1-1/2 hour tour and it was fascinating, we learnt so much and so glad we went. Sorry we missed the last post ceremony though. The cafe was excellent too."
An amazing place to visit.,"Wow what an amazing place, so full of information I could not even have imagined.We only had a few hours to get around it which wasn't nearly enough time to full appreciate it but we did get to see everything. It is definitely on our list of must revisits when we head back to Canberra."
Family Reunion,"This is a great place to stay. Very happy with the breakfast each morning. The rooms are very clean n they are serviced daily, It is central to public transport on the busy road. We feel very comfortable staying here."
A must see,Allow plenty of time to visit. A must see if visiting Canberra.Wear comfortable shoes and clothes and great place to visit on a hot Canberra day.
Pleasantly surprised ,"I m not the biggest fan of Long visits to war memorials, but having just spent about an hour there, I would be back on a subsequent visit to check out the galleries.This time the focus went to the general places and our daughter also managed to obtain an extract of one of the war victims she researched in school. A poppy next to his name."
Australian War Memorial,This trip was a lovely experience for a 12 year old boy. Our guide was lovely and could answer all the questions we asked. He showed us  the best parts of the exhibit and was just very nice. He also showed us awesome experiences and told us all the information that was scheduled.
War Memorial - Don't miss this experience.,The War Memorial is an art gallery and a trip back in time.The dioramas are beautifully made and give you a feel of wartime in the trenches.Will it make humans stop fighting and killing?  Who knows but it gives you a good idea of what war is - and what we should avoid.Of interest for any age or nationality.
A day very well spent,A visit to the Australian War Memorial is an experience every Australian should have at least once in his/her lifetime.
Travel back in time to WW2,Very well curated collection of WW2 memorabilia from both Allied and Axis forces. Might need two days to cover everything properly.
Moving Experience,"This is a incredible display of Australia's involvement of all wars, the sections have been placed together from people who have a knowledge & appreciation of our involvement. Some of the finer detail in the displays are worth the visit. The Bomber Command display is a must. Stayed to the end to watch the commemoration ceremony & the pool of reflection. this again should be on your list as they paid respects to a fallen soldier, with his family also in attendance laying reefs.This closure to a great day was well worth the stay. This whole display should be on everyuones list in particular for children to be made aware of our history"
Last post,"I was fortunate to be involved in the ceremony at 5pm which tells the story of one of the individuals from the roll of honour.. I have lived in Canberra for over 15 years and had never attended this event until today... what an experience that I will remember... to see the faces of the crowd, very young, school children through to the elderly... it is certainly something to experience ..,,"
We won't forget,"My sister and her husband and I went to the Memorial and it was near closing time so we stayed until all the ceremony was over.  It was extremely cold but the service was beautiful.  It really did make you pause and reflect on the meaning of their sacrifice and the lives that were left on foreign soil.  The school students were at the ceremony laying down their wreath.  They sat on the cold tiles in the open and I mean it was very very cold.  Only short sleeves on their garments.  Some with no jumpers or jackets.  Brrrrr.  However, trying to get back from the ceremony after finishing was an ordeal.  They (the administation) said they had ordered a taxi for us, but after waiting for 1 hour - no taxi appreared and we were the only ones left waiting.  All lights were off and there we stood looking at the Parliament buildings on the end of the road way   Had it not been for the fact that another gentleman was waiting for his taxi, we would still be standing there."
Time well spent ,"The exhibits were systematically displayed and easy to follow.  The same meticulous organisation showed in the 90 min free guided tour as well -  the volunteer was great in delivering the overall pictures peppered with interesting heroic stories.  The tour ended within a climate in a light and sound show about Sydney under Attack. Very thoughtful and well done! As a Singaporean,  I was also pleasantly surprised to see the fall of Singapore in ww2 from a different perspective.  P/s -  visit the poppy cafe next door for nice coffee and food!"
Sombre but interesting,"The Australian War Memorial is a powerful place to reflect on our history of war.  Displays are continually updated and not at all militaristic, although the military history buffs are well catered for."
We only had 2.5hours there so I would go again tomorrow if I had the chance,"To be frank I was not keen on going but my wife and friends were going so rather than be a misery  I went to. We am I so glad I did. We arrived just in time for a little 90 minute tour with a very interesting and informative guide. There were only about 8 of us and we enjoyed every minute and I regretted it was ending although we did get about 2 hours. What a fantastic experience to hear how Australi played its part in both wars was so enlightening and as an immigrant I was not aware but was proud that I am now Australian and these men boys and Ladies fought , got injured and sadly so many died tro allow Australia to be as great as it is. We all have a responsibility to ensure it stays tthat way. If I am any where near Canberra in future this is the one place I will visirt again and again.  It is a must place to take the Children to and one day when they are old enough we will take the Grandchildren."
War memorial,"Outstanding,would take two full days to see the lot,after Uluru i think this is now our second greatest attraction,and a credit to the Australian goverment for not letting us forget them."
Nice,Its good place to see for 1day tour. Lots of information provided. Indoor tour guides available. Kids like it a lot
Australian War Memorial,"We did this with a guide on a free tour.  It is an awesome place to see just how tough life was back in the times of the first and second world wars.  The memorial is a place to remember those that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.  If these people in our past did not do what they did we would have had a very different now.  The guides are great and full of knowledge.  The displays are incredible and to see them all at a comfortable pace takes about 3 to 4 hours.  There are over 102,000 names on the wall there so you may find a relative.  If you are there at around 5 pm there is a beautiful ceremony and the last post is played."
Very Impressive,"I feel that if anyone is in Australia, The War Memorial is a must see. We were there for the Remembrance Day Service. All the pomp and ceremony, band and dignitaries. Perfect weather, The War Memorial is sobering and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is breathtaking. The staff are extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of the displays and history. A must for all travelers."
Impressive,Was there only few hours and would take a few days to see and read everything. As Europeans we don't know much about Australians in the wars. It is really interesting and informative.
Significantly Expanded and Better than Ever!,"With the addition of ANZAC Hall the war memorial has roughly doubled in size. Wide range of interesting, thought provoking memorials covering all the battles in which Australia has been engaged."
Very impressed ,My husband and l spent a few hours here on our visit to Canberra and were so impressed with the museum we came back a couple of days later to see what we had missed the first time. Entry is free as is the 90 min tour which is excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpfull and seem to be just there when you get lost! We stayed for the Last Post ceremony which is daily at 4.55 pm. and it was very moving. Would definitely recommend a visit.
Best museum in Australia,By far the highlight of Canberra and would do it again in a heartbeat recommend a guided tour unless your a major history buff and there is so much to see read and learn that it can be overwhelming. Absolutely amazing though it's a must see
Wonderful showcase,Magnificent and detailed. the AWM captures Australian history in its hardest and finest times. The Curators and staff have displayed and captured the times and the sentiments perfectly. I can't believe it is free to enter
"Great, historic day out","Took a free 90 minute tour, showing highlights of this museum.  Well worthwhile as it is a huge museum and a bit overwelming..  Unguided, it would be difficult to know where to start.  Very moving experience.  You could easily spend a whole day here."
More than a war memorial,The museum was really interesting and split in to easy sections... fab views of the parliament building and the tomb of the unknown soldier and actual memorial was suitably poignant... didn’t stay long but was worth the visit... easy access and parking and free entry etc...
Humbling experience,You can't go to Canberra and not see the War Memorial.  It is a full day as there is so much to see and it is so humbling to hear of their stories and what they have been through.  There is something there for everyone.
Heart wrenching experience,"Wonderful, very emotional and informative depiction of  Australia in various conflicts.  We were there for over 8 hours over 2 days and still ran out of time.  Be prepared to be emotional and angry (at what humans can do to each other).  A definite must do in Canberra."
Day tour of War Memorial,"This is a must do for every Australian.  This superb exhibition is a wonderful testament and memorial to our fallen.  The memorial really needs a couple of days to see every thing properly, but taking one of the excellent guided tours and then filling in areas of interest for a couple of hours will provide a memorable tour."
Excellent!,Take tissues or a hanky.Be sure to be there for the last post at 4.55.A must visit place for all Australians and all visitors.
So awe inspiring,I wonderful tribute to all those who have served for our country. The atmosphere is fantastic and fitting for the history and tributes being paid to our diggers.
Words cannot describe,"Only thing I can say is GO THERE. Amazing history, amazing staff, amazing grounds, ........The $5 booklet available in shop is worth buying  before you start. Has map and highlights. Guided tours every half hour"
A must-visit museum,"We caught a bus to the War Memorial which was nice and easy. The vista down the avenue across to Parliament is very special. We took the free guided tour which was interesting, then checked out the displays. The dioramas are very good, and portray conditions at the time very well. Interesting for a New Zealander, I think it’s a place all Australians should visit."
Wow wow wow ,You will need a few days to really enjoy and see everything. The best war memorial you will see and been touch by it. Staff were very good and helpful.  Will be back there next time we are in Canberra.  It a must for any visitors to the city.
A moving experience,I have been to the Australian War Memorial a number of times now. It is sad and inspiring at the same time.  I cannot help but feel the emotion that the displays and images bring. A must see for everyone visiting Canberra.
Interesting and unique,We were fortunate to have a tour guide that knew much about how the Parlimentary form of government functions in Australia. The views of the city from the grass slope on top of the building were really great for picture taking.
RESPECT ,"Travelled to Canberra on a personal quest to find out more about a fallen digger from WW11 on my wife’s side.Very moving and extremely humbling, boy oh boy do we whine and winge about bugger all.This is and indeed should be one of Australia’s pilgrimage destinations."
Superb tribute to the fallen,We visited on Armistice Day which was very busy but superb. The memorial is beautiful and well worth a visit any day. It is a 20 minute easy walk from the Canberra Centre. The free Culture Loop bus stops there and this bus  also stops at most of the main attractions.
A somber but awesome experience,"On government business earlier in the month, we were taken to the Australian War Memorial by some of our Aussie military colleagues, and the experience was both somber and uplifting. Somber, because it represents all of the military losses suffered by Australia going back 100 years, but uplifting because of the amazing design of the museum, the presence of local school children, and the more recent addition of the Last Post Ceremony, where we were permitted to lay a wreath. Our local friends tell us that all Australian school children are required to tour the museum at various times in their education, which is a great way to get them a first hand understanding of the costs of war, but also of the tremendous acts of courage and valor committed by their countrymen in a time of need.The museum was specifically located so that members of Parliament would have to look down the long mall and be reminded of the cost of sending young men and women to war, which is an excellent thing to keep in mind.In the museum, we spent about 90 minutes looking at the various displays with a professional guide, but to really appreciate the totality of the museum displays, plan to spend at least three hours. I've been to a great many museums, and this is amongst the most impressive as far as quality and thoroughness of the displays, the architecture, and layout.If you've any spare time in Canberra, do not miss a trip to the Australian War Memorial, and be sure to stay for the Last Post ceremony."
ANZAC remembered,"The War Memorial is more than just a place of rememberance. It is alo an excellent war museum chronicling the history of Australians in all the wars, but principally the 1914-18 war and the Gallipoli landings.  The high spot of the museum is the range of aircraft on display - including a Lancaster bomber, Mosquito and a jet Meschermitt og 1945.At 16.55 every day a moving ceremony takes place to remember a particular casualty.Surviving relatives are invited. His story is told. The Last Post is sounded.Not to be missed."
AMAZING!!!!!,"Learning about the history of Australia in the wars was superb. There is a free guided tour that I would highly recommend. The tour takes about 1.5-2 hours and only points out some of the exibits. You could easily spend 5 days in here and still not see everything though.Admittance is free, they only ask for a donation, so I cannot recommend this enough.Our tour guide was Ian, he was fantastic and obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about all the exhibits."
Don't miss this site!,"This is one of the most moving war memorials I have ever visited.  It speaks of honor and service, and it honors those who have lost their lives beautifully."
Honour and privelage,"Absolutely loved this place.  Went on the free tour.  If you go to Canberra, this is a must do.  The exhibits were educational and heart wrenching.  The exhibits on the recent wars were heart warming as it showed our four legged friends as well.  The kids enjoyed that particular exhibit.  Kids also enjoyed the discovery centre where they got to wear uniforms and sit in a real helicopter.  Could of spent the whole day and more here looking at all the exhibits."
A must see for all Australians,"This was an overwhelmingly emotional visit. Though we have had members of our family in WWII - they all survived. Walking into the Memorial part was one of the saddest experiences I have ever had. All those names - with accompanying poppies - of the men and women who fought for our freedom, so many did not return. The museum part was so full of information and was a sombre experience. Everyone should visit this memorial to understand how our country came to have our freedom and democracy."
Absolutely one of the best,"This is a must visit location, very Australian centric not surprisingly but really does paint an amazing picture of Australia’s commitment to the old empire and the costs. The airplane galley is shortly to be refurbished so either get in quick to see one of the best sections or check and see when it is completed. The WW1 Peter Jackson flight display is amazing you feel like you are there"
History ,History can be an eye opener here.What a great place to visit and knowledgeable place for kids.will bring in kids to canberra next time
Moving experience,"My partner and I visited the War Memorial on a weekend trip to Canberra. Such a moving experience. Spent 4 hours here and had to leave to catch a flight, however I could have spent the whole day here. We did a 90 min guided tour at the start of our visit and the guide (wish I could remember his name - lovely fellow!) was extremely knowledgeable and kind. I would highly recommend a visit if you’re in the ACT. A clear highlight of our trip to Canberra and if we are ever in the area we will make time to visit again"
War Memorial visit,"Arrived in the morning requiring breakfast. We ate at Poppy's which is attached on the site. Food was excellent and reasonably priced.Museum has undergone many changes since my last visit approx. 10 years ago and if someone says I saw that some time ago, then they need to go again. Displays have been updated and extended. Employees are very friendly and helpful. We spent around 2 hours there due to time constraints but could easily fill the whole day in there. Plenty of underground parking. I have been there a number of times over the years and always thoroughly enjoy my visit"
Highly recommended.,We visited over two days. So much to take in. The displays are well set out and really superb. At the end of the first day we stayed on for the Last Post ceremony. Very moving. Don’t miss the statue of the dog handler and his dog on the way to Poppies cafe. Having seen the happy photo of them together in the memorial building it was gut wrenching to know that an IED had ended their lives.
"Alain’s are not war-like, but we have been going to wars since before we became a nation.","The AWM tells the stories of Australians at war (and peacekeeping) since the Boer War. It was created in the aftermath of WW1, to attempt to stop further wars through education and commemoration.Visit the Honour Roll, various dioramas from WW1, artefacts, paintings and photographs (Australia has official war artists), are items used by sailors, soldiers and airmen. There are planes, a submarine, numerous guns, etc. The AWM does not honour war, but instead invites the visitor to wonder at the “art of war” and sacrifices by those who went.IMPORTANT: If possible, attend the Last Post Ceremony in the central, outdoor Reflection Pool area surrounded by the Honour Roll. It is from 4.45-5.10pm every day. It honours one, and sometimes several, of those who died in war, named on the Roll. Their story is told, family members lay a wreath, plus visiting organisations who have made prior arrangements. A ‘lament’ is played, then the Last Post is sounded out by a bugler. The sentiment is understandable to anyone, even if they do not speak English."
"4.45 playing of the last post and honouring one serviceperson, laying a wreath for them.","Get there a little early as there are many people.  Very moving ceremony so be prepared with a tissue, it will bring tears to your eyes.  A visit to the AWM is a must when you are in Canberra  The ceremony starts at approximately 5 p.m.  This small ceremony is for everyone."
Even if you are not into War you should visit.,Always stop here when in Canberra. It makes you appreciate what our men and women who have given their lives for this country had to go through.
Social trip,The war memorial is ever changing with new and upgraded exhibits. It's more than somewhere that glorifies war but a study on the social history of Australia.Love bringing friends there.
"Mixed bag, mixed emotions","For the keen amateur military historian you’d be forgiven for thinking that the AWM (as it likes to call itself) would be a treasure trove, must see destination. And certainly, for those who know from nothing to a moderate amount about any of the history surrounding Australia’s involvements in so many wars, conflicts and peacekeeping missions, the exhibits can throw some light into the otherwise dark recesses of our ignorance. And I also concede that the AWM is currently undergoing the very early stages of a major, multi-million dollar expansion and refurbishment of their facilities, making space an issue and therefore requiring compromises of the depth of what can be illustrated, exhibited and explained therein. However, in this visitor’s view, there has been a dilution of so many of the narratives and a confusing jumble of incoherent exhibitions as a result. Add to this the mythologizing nature of the Australian media’s view of “ANZAC traditions” and the “Birth of a Nation” embodied in the Gallipoli experience, and a tendency of politicians to militarize our view of history and it’s commemoration, and you get a stilted and distorted perspective of our past, however stirring, moving and emotional it may be to some. I look forward to visiting, as I have done so many times in the past, the completed exhibition halls once completed. For. Ow, I find them crowded, disjointed, confusing and, however unintentionally, somewhat misleading. Don’t avoid this massive monument to military hardware, but be prepared to be less accurately illuminated about our history than you might expect, and be prepared to share the experience with rather more people than you may have expected."
Last service is phenomenal,"It was our best place in visit in Canberra, and we could have spent days there if we had the luxury of time! Would recommend staying till 5pm for the service they have at the end of the day to pay respects to one of the fallen. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the capital city of Australia."
"Amazing, a must see",What a wonderful place to visit. I definitely needed much more than the 2.5 hours I was there. It was fascinating.We stayed for the reading of the letter from an ex serviceman and the last post. I can’t wait to go back.
an eye-opening experience into Australia's military history,The Australian War Memorial is a must see for all Australians.  We spent half a day here and only saw about a third of the exhibits - you could easily spend two days there and still not see it all.  Obviously as this is a war memorial there are lots of stories of the misery of war but there are also equally just as many stories of the triumph of the Aussie spirit and human nature - the balance is done very well.There is a great kids section that younger kids will enjoy and helps keep their enthusiasm up for the sections that mum and dad (and older kids) are interested in.
Thought provoking and very well done,"Definitely worth a visit. The War Memorial is beautifully presented, and acknowledges history and consequences of war in a meaningful way."
Very moving,We spent several hours here but could have spent many more  Very well done and the sets and movies are excellent
Inspiring,"This is a must see when in Australia. The thought which has gone into the creating the memorial is supported by all the staff, with their passion in presentation and willingness to assist each and every visitor to understand and appreciate the sacrifices that have been made and continue to be made, by their fellow country men and women."
Powerful Presentation ,Returned to the AWM for the first time in 41 years... it was impressive then but the interactive nature of the memorial today is incredibly powerful.  No cost just a request for donations makes it even more attractive to those on a budget.. the horrors of war are on full display in a graphic manner.. don’t miss spending a few hours here when in Canberra...
Enriching experience,"In spite of a war memorial, it teaches you to make peace, very beautifully crafted place, giving due respect to the Australian soldiers"
Great place to visit,Enjoyed a very nice afternoon here on a guided tour. Very moving experience and so much to see. Easily recommend visiting
An Excellent Tribute to Those Who Have Served,"The new Annex in Mitchell is a tremendous exhibition of aircraft that have served the Australian Defence Force in times of conflict. Of particular interest is A8-134, the only RF-111C which conducted photographic reconnaissance missions over East Timor."
Moving War memorial,"Such a well laid out memorial, one feels humbled at the sacrifices made by the fallen named on the walls surrounding the pool of remembrance, the tour was conducted by a very dedicated volunteer who had an amazing knowledge of the soldiers and their deeds during all the major wars Australia participated in. Highlights were the Victoria crosses on display the vast amount of tanks, planes, weapons, uniforms. To cap it all off every evening there is a dedication to a fallen service person with a last post, so meaningful"
Weekend ,Extremely interesting and educational a great historical place to visit you can spend all day just looking around there.
What more can I say!,There has been enough said to describe this place. An emotional and yet uplifting experience. Forget the guided tour strike out on your own.
Absolutely a must,Can see why has the reputation and everyone says to go.  Is in a beautiful location and displays are magnificent.Easy parking.  Cafes on site (but did not go).I am not a war buff but still did 3 hours there.  If you were a war buff you would be there all day and returning...........
A must visit,"Wow, a must visit when in Canberra, so much to see and the history and sacrifice of our soldiers is incredible, they have done such a great job and give yourself plenty of time to see as much as you can"
Emotional,"Spent hours here, well worth the trip from Sydney. Guide was very knowledgeable. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Roll of Honour is very emotional to see."
Always moving and respectful,A must see when in Canberra but make sure you allow plenty of time. There is a lot more to see then you first think. The sequence of exhibits in the museum is very respectful and quite moving. Excellent education as well. Added respect for those who the memorial honours.
Well displayed museum and staff were excellent.,We attended a free tour by Murray Hanson a volunteer at the War Memorial.  We were enthralled by the stories he told at various selected displays.  His knowledge was excellent and all were told with gravitas and compassion.We returned for the ceremony at the end of the day to honour one of the thousands of people who are on the roll of honour.
Must See,The number one place to visit in the ACT. The whole place is respectful and not celebratory. A Memorial to past both good and bad.
Facinating History,"I have always enjoyed visiting the Memorial, from a small boy to a fifty something adult. The Memorial tells a fantastic story on the military history of our country and how the ""spirit"" of Australia came about.You can't not be moved by the stories and sacrifices of our service men and women."
What a credit to the establishment... ,"We had friends visit from Denmark so we decided to visit this famous land mark of Australia. The grounds of this building are absolutely beautiful. Lush green grass, beautiful established trees and level paths that sweep up to the entry. The memorial is enter by donation after you have had your bag scanned. This venue has so much memorabilia and information. The presentation of absolutely everything is top notch. You could spend hours and hours at this venue. We really enjoyed our time exploring, learning and paying our respects."
Red Hat Chapter visit from Perth DDDames.,"Very moving service. Needed more time, so much to see in the museum. The guided tour by the volunteer was very slow and laboured which impacted on the time left to see other sections of the museum. Will have to travel back Canberra in the future."
Educational and very moving,This museum is a very educational place and it is also very moving. The architecture is also very beautiful. I have been here maybe more than 5 times but it gets me every time
Cannot add much to >9700 reviews to date,"I have been to the War Memorial 4 or 5 times over the past 30+ years, but my visit this past week was my first visit in several years.It is a very powerful place to visit, so much to see and absorb, so much history, yet too much to see in 2 - 3 hours. The directors and staff should be congratulated.But this was the first time that I was ever there at the end of the day when there is a tribute and the playing of the Last Post, remembering those who gave their lives for Australia. If ever you visit, plan to go in the afternoon."
Always first class ,No matter how many times you visit the galleries there is always something to observe or read about First class displays with an incredible wealth of material You would need years to take it all in
Beautiful tribute,A wonderful experience and could have spent more time than the 4 hours. Excellent displays with some bringing you to tears - what our men and women went through was unbelievable.The aircraft displays were fantastic and were better than the displays we experienced in the States
A must for every Australian,The building itself is incredible... staff inside are amazing and the exhibitions are world class.Having said that this is not a theme park and it is important to take a few moments when there to reflect on the sacrifice made by so many. I was there with children 7  & 10 and it provided some great discussion both during and after the visit
A must visit in Canberra.,"You simply must not miss the Australian War Memorial. Beautiful grounds, loads of displays and some great demonstrations. Take a guided tour it is very moving."
Top War  Memorial,"We have been to the War Memorial in Canberra a number of times. It is a huge complex and it houses such amazing feats of bravery, courage, self-sacrifice, and much more. A visit there is always a solemn occasion. The displays are fantastic and transport you to times past. This is a truly incredible place to visit and no wonder it seems to be right at the heart of the Nation's Capital. It is, it could be said, at the centre of the whole of the country. Highly recommended."
Eastern states visit ,This would have to be best described as the most emotional Tour on anyones visit to the Capitol.The gathering of information presented is such an interactive Way is exceptional.The Memorial is a must visit for everyone.
"Great history, excellent for genealogy",Wonderful real-life displays showing a wealth of information. Lots of walking but no time limit so you can have a really good look around. We went back a second day.
Awesome Museum/Memorial,It was an emotional experience visiting the Citadel and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is an awesome memorial and museum of Australia's military history. A must see. Staff were always on hand to provide information and guidance about the exhibits. The presentation of memorabilia was very polished/professional.
Phenominal,Amazingly presented. Very informative and well laid out. Very moving and important to see. Really helpful staff.
A very peaceful place to reflect,"Would highly recommend this place as it is informative, respectful and peaceful.It makes you take the time to reflect on the sacrifices made by others. We spent the whole day here and could have spent more time. We did a free tour to start with which was excellent, thank you Ken.Then we wandered around at our own pace.It was definitely worth staying for the Last Post which was very moving. Would highly recommend."
Don’t need a tour but buy aural tour of 1st World War exhibit,"Last time we were here we joined a tour, this time with teenagers we decided not to. However we did buy the aural headset tour for the WW1 exhibit, this is so well done we all enjoyed it."
Excellent display of our war history,"If you are interested in Australia’s war history, this is a must see. There’s detailed coverage of WW1 and WW2 including photos, videos, dioramas, equipment, clothing and weapons all recovered from both wars. There’s also a section on wars after 1945 but we didn’t get time to see them in depth (screaming baby ended our visit early).Entry is free and you can’t take as much time as you want. There’s lots of bus tours, some of which are guided so you have to try and not get stuck in amongst those groups. There’s some incredible real stories of soldiers in the wars and a section dedicated to VC recipients. There’s also a cafe right next to the main building so you can drinks/food and use toilets there as well. There’s on site public parking, but no real easy public transport that runs directly to the memorial (as far as we knew anyway) so it’s easier to either drive or get a cab."
War history in human terms,"Wonderful displays, very interesting guides, a humbling experience. you can easily spend three to four hours here, Children would greatly benefit from a visit"
Magnificent ,Whether inside or outside this is a great memorial and should be on everyone's bucket list. It is better than the imperial war museum in london.  If you go to poppys cafe expect a wait.
One of the highlights of Canberra,"We visited the AWM for an afternoon and had put side a good couple of hours. When we arrived we were advised there was a guided tour starting soon so we decided to join that, I am very glad we did. We were shown around the entire Memorial, with history and personal stories shared by our guide (who I have to assume is a veteran but I don't know for sure). Seeing active military personal around the site also had a huge impact, some were there to learn about the history of Australia in combat, others were there performing drills and ceremony. Simply seeing the wall plaques of names was a moving experience. We spent close to 3 hours there, and didn't see everything. Would love to visit again."
Beyond expectation,"This place is much bigger that what it looks from the outside. Beautiful inside and give you lots of understanding about ANZAC and Australia history. The museum inside is modern and very well looked after. The entrance is free, there is a little donation box at the entrance. I think this place is really worth a visit when in Canberra."
Greyline Australia Day Tour,"Great piece of Australian War History, a must see as to what this small nation has been involved with in it's short colonial history, and why they are now such an important part of NATO"
A Must Visit place,"The museum is extremely well layed out and beautifully, respectfully presented. It is quite emotional to go round and remember those that have their all for us.The Last Post Service was lovely to be able to be part of and experience."
a must see,"Coming to Canberra and not seeing the War Memorial is not a done thing, always enjoyable and ever changing displays, the staff are fantastic"
Took my 90 year old mother for a tour in a wheelchair,The war memorial was extensive and very well presented and informative. It was very actual. My mother survived world war 2 and related so much with everything she saw. It helped me kniw more history too. The place is wheelxhair friendly throughout.  It can just be the parking that is a distance if you park outside. Everything else is impressive.
Amazing place...well worth the time to visit,"We went to the war memorial twice. It is an amazing place. Well presented and has many exhibits to see. We really enjoyed the shows...there are 3 different shows at the very back of the memorial in the Anzac hall. I went with teens and they were mesmerised by these displays, especially the mini re-enactment film by Peter Jackson.If you have time, the last post is also a must. It is a very moving ceremony where wreaths are laid and the story of a fallen soldier is read. Often relatives of the soldier are present. It is a very emotional experience."
The must visit of Canberra,A beautifully presented memorial with an extensive range of exhibits to suit all ages. We spent 3+ hours and could easily have been longer. The Last Post memorial at the end of the day is a truly amazing experience for reflection and remembrance. Every Australian should visit at least once. The avenue of memorial sculptures leading to the museum is also a great walk.
Always exceptionial,We visit each time we are in Canberra. The last post ceremony is a must and very moving. Allow yourself at least 3 hours...sooo much to see and you won't be disappointed.
National War Memorial,Not to be missed whilst visiting Canberra. I recommend you stay for the closing ceremony - a lovely tribute to those that gave their lives for our country.
Solemn place of Remembrance ,"A truly magnificent place of remembrance for those whom died fighting for our country and freedom. It is very informative/educational for all age groups, allow at least half a day to a full day for your visit. The 90 minute tour was very worth while and the guide was very knowledgeable and spook with passion in a respectful manner. The Tomb of the unnamed soldier is spectacular. Large range of souvenirs available at the gift shop. The service at 5pm every evening post closing time is very worth staying for."
there is so much to see that we had to make a two day trip there,"Allow plenty of time to look around so many interactive things to do and see. So well covered in all the conflicts, real size planes and tanks. You can take a tour or go alone at your pace. We did the tour and then went back to the favorites afterwards."
Solemn place of remembrance ... ruined by the disrespect shown by some disrespectful families and school groups ,"We visited the AWM many times over 40 or more years, but this visit was sadly impacted by several family and school groups with ill disciplined children and some adults, who appeared to us to consider the AWM just another entertainment attraction on the Canberra Visitor circuit.Children running around, adults yelling out to each other and the children, lack of teacher supervision over school children talking loudly, giggling with each other clearly disinterested in the AWM ... maybe the AWM needs to install an indoor children’s play center!!Very disappointed by the behaviour of some who were there at same time as us.I urge the AWM staff to take effective control over the behaviour of those visitors who so clearly disrespect the AWM.Complaints to some AWM staff to address the issue did not result in any action.Most people do shown great respect, but the disrespect of the few are sadly ignored and I urge others to speak up."
Extremely well presented Australian history - a shame it is based on war,The tour is an absolute must. The volunteer guides are so passionate - proud and knowledgeable about this museum. The tour is approximately 1 1/2 hrs. I am unable to put into words the feeling I got as I walked around the museum before and after the tour. I think the time to allow when visiting will vary with each individual but I cannot impress how valuable the tour is. Highly recommend also that you walk up to the museum if able to view the artworks and memorials along each side of the avenue. Also the cafe is worth a visit.
Holidays,A great place to visit. Very interesting and informative. Go later in the day and you can see the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the last post.
WOW!,"This is a must see for all ages.An incredible display of  Australia’s involvement in many theatres of war throughout the years.We were amazed at the amount of people that were there to learn and to pay their respects.Various aircraft, the submarine that entered Sydney Harbour and numerous displays , videos and static.Just go and be amazed.( to do justice to this iconic display it will take two days)"
great experience - a must for Canberra visitors,"had not been to the museum for 20 years and the changes have been awesome. well organised, plenty of guides and tours - you can spend a whole day here - the light, visual displays happening every 1/2 hour are terrific."
Unmissable while in Canberra,"The Australian War Memorial is an unmissable attraction to visit in Canberra. Besides the interactive exhibits it houses, the best thing to do is the daily Last Post Ceremony. It begins at 4.45 pm so be there about 4.30 pm (4.00 pm if you want to lay a wreath). The incredibly moving ceremony lasts about 30 minutes and highlights one person  per day who served in WW1. As it is an outdoor ceremony, dress for the appropriate weather and I would recommend flat shoes. You can take photos and the staff tell you when to take off your hat. It is a solemn ceremony and appropriate behaviour is expected. People usually don't talk to each other expect for a hushed whisper during the ceremony.The rest of the Memorial offers interactive exhibits of all the conflicts that Australia has been a part of. The WW1 gallery has been renovated and it is informative and has interactivity via iPads so you can get the stories behind what you are looking at. There are no labels displayed with the items which I found a bit frustrating as I didn't want to have to use an iPad - just look at the displays.The Last Post Ceremony is a great way to finish your visit at the War Memorial as it feels as though honour has been given to those who have given their life for our freedoms."
War Memorial - Canberra,"The AWM is the premier place of remembrance for Australians. It is sombre and respectful, but informative and educational at the same time.  The galleries and displays are detailed and reflective of the time...I would recommend that those who had relatives serve in conflict come and see the amazing recreations and take advantage of the family history research area."
PERFECTION,"I recently had the pleasure of attending The Australian War Memorial over the October Lond Weekend, my first visit in over 20 years. What an absolute pleasure from the parking facilities & staff through to the Qualitiy of displays and The dignity and personal touch given to this Australian Icon. Thank you very much"
Excellent Free tour by an AWM Volunteer,We took advantage of one of the free  90 minute tours by Henry Mould and thoroughly enjoyed it. Henry was very informative and gave us a valuable understanding of the various conflicts and exhibitions.From there we remained and viewed the remaining areas independently.The sight and sound displays were particularly well presented.
A national treasure,A visit to the Australian War Memorial is a must when in Canberra. A very humbling and thought provoking experience.
Worth a Visit,Haven't been to the War Memorial for over 15 years.  It was a very good display about the men and women who sacrificed everything so we have a wonderful country today.  Worth staying for the last post at the end of the day - very moving.The Landing Cafe - very disappointing though.  Coffee was nice but dirty tables.
Spectacular!,"This is a must when in Canberra. The museum does an excellent job presenting Australia’s participation in wars from the Boer War to Afghanistan. It is a fitting memorial to those who sacrificed their lives for their country (over 102,000) and a fitting tribute to those who served their country."
Definitely a must see when in Canberra ,The War Memorial is a magnificent tribute to the soldiers who fought and protected our country. So much history in the museum and well worth the 2 days looking and reading the history of our soldiers. The Last Post at the end of the day is a must to pay respect to a fallen soldier which is held each day. Will certainly go back and see the next time in Canberra.
Interesting visit,"War Memorial was quite interesting to visit, although we probably viewed it within an hour , but a must to see."
Australian War Memorial,Did a tour of the Memorial with excellent commentary by Jeff.  So interesting to listen to.  Stayed for the last post.  Spent about 6 hours there which included a wonderful lunch on the deck outside.
A beautiful memorial,Great tour done by our guide. Very knowledgeable. Meaningful memorial to those that have served in very difficult times.
Showing off,"We arrived for coffee and then spent a whole day and still never finished what was on show.  The exhibition of items has been enhanced by lighting and the use of glass cases.  The good old favourites are still as good as ever but the work being done  and the flow from one room to another is great.  A very quiet place though loads of people, lots of phones being used but only for the camera work.  Staff were helpful at the desk and when one of our companions had a fall. Quick and efficient. More visits on offer. Next time start at shop and go backwards.  Still not been downstairs.  Excellent."
Always moving,I spent a lot of time with the outdoor exhibits and the bridge of the HMAS Brisbane. Really well presented. The War Memorial is always moving and the aviation section is impressive. Very helpful staff who know their stuff. Always be respectful for those on both sides.
A Solemn and Informative Australian Jewel,This is a very beautiful place of remembrance. Amazing informative displays. You could spend many hours here. Not much more to say other than it should definitely be on your list of places to see.
Very respectful,"We stayed all day and really would have gone back as 1 day is not enough time to see all of the exhibits. Amazing displays, moving video presentations, insightful look into a full range of conflicts and such knowledgeable staff makes it a must see attraction in Canberra."
"Very moving, want to go back.",This was an amazing and very moving experience. We want to return as we did not have enough time to see all. We laid a wreath as part of the Last Post Ceremony which commences at 4.45 every day if you go you have to be there at this time to experience this beautiful ceremony.
Amazing ,"We spent all day and could of returned the next. Brilliantly set out, we would love to return on a other trip. Very respectful!"
"Stunning, Aussies you should be so proud","A fabulous visit to this impressive museum and memorial. Coming from the UK and having recently visited our own Imperial War Museum I can make a direct comparison, I can say that your memorial is absolutely superb and blew us away with the quality of the exhibits and the method of education throughout. The poppy walls are amazing and what a lovely reminder to the brave souls who have fought for your country over the years from all around the world. We particularly enjoyed the last post ceremony and would say it was a must do ,so pleased to see some young children there as well learning about the futility of war. Thank you Australia for an unforgettable day out."
Wow!,An absolutely amazing place. Such a powerful place to visit and reflect on our history in connection to war.
Simply amazing ,"Great layout, engaging exhibits and helpful staff! Also, very tastefully done. A must visit when in Canberra."
"no matter what your beliefs are, this is a must see","a fantastic attraction. everybody needs to visit this memorial. humankind needs to know and needs to remember so that we don't make the same mistakes again. would love to be there for the last post at the end of a day, but probably not during school holidays.easy walk back to Canberra CBD."
Busy but good,"Went in school holidays, could barely move in parts but good to visit. well presented and free of charge, would be good to have a one page map."
Superb Memorial and Museum,"We wandered to this place and were absolutely amazed by the memorial for lost war heroes. As well, we found there was a museum, and it was absolutely wonderful. So huge, so many artefacts, very nice facilities and great service from the staff too. If you had time, the displays carefully document and explain the most important and painful of times during each of the major wars. Great 10/10. Must see, especially if you are into history."
Must See,"It should be on everyone's list of ""must see"" buildings in Australia. A tribute to those who served our country and those still serving."
Our world class war memorial / museum,Spent a great - and emotional - day at our national war memorial on 30 Sep 19. Extraordinarily well presented materials. The daily Last Post ceremony was so tastefully presented. An ABSOLUTE MUST on any tourist list!
Don't Miss,"What a great experience made that way by taking the afternoon tour with our guide (John or Greg, sorry I can't recall because he was excellent). So much to see, learn, do.  Make sure you leave 3-4 hours if you want to experience everything and stay until the end for the formal ceremony honoring one of the vets at the end of the day/closing time if you can. One of our best stops of our trip!"
Husband and wife,A magnificent war museum. Very moving and gives you an idea of the terrible times our solders had to endure in ww1 and ww2. You need at least a full day to absorb it all
War memorial,It was very moving see who has lost their lives to protect us. It has amazing visual displays with the stories to match.  The last post at 5.00pm brought me to tears.
Extremely moving,"My sister and I visited here as our grandfather fought in WWII at Kokoda and other family members in WWI. The displays are excellent and extremely well-presented, with so much to look and read. We stayed for the Last Post Ceremony, which very moving, and it was great to see so many young people at the memorial."
Research family members,Greg in the Research room was very helpful giving me information on my family and printing out res7lts to take home.
Wow!!,"What an interesting visit. We walked up and along the way were great memorials all the way up until the main building. Beautiful location and beautifully set up. An eye opener. Great and insightful displays, great and helpful staff.."
Thought provoking,"The free tour was excellent, thanks to our guide Richard. Very impressive building and quite thought provoking."
Must see,"Please do yourselves a favour and take the time to explore this beauty. A full day is recommended and even do a free tour. We did the highlights tour and then went back thru on our own but with out the kids and on a different day. The only disappointing thing about the tour was it didn’t go down stairs to the “peacekeeping” section nor did they mention anything about the discovery centre. I think if we knew about them the first time my kids would have enjoyed it a bit more. So please go down stairs and explore. Otherwise this was my fave place in Canberra. The history, the displays, the stories and the building is second to none."
"Very informative tour, lots to see",Walked into the war memorial just in time for a tour. Our guide was excellent -very knowledgeable and spoke well. He showed us the highlights and explained the scenario with some anecdotes as well. Really good and well worth joining in.
Really well done ,"It’s not a trip to Canberra without a visit to the war memorial. It’s a national icon that has been wonderfully done. Very interesting, with lots to see for all ages."
When visiting Canberra this is a must do... ,Free entry. One of the best exhibits in Australia with various original piece's of war time items from firearms to fighter planes. The lighting shows are interesting to watch. Definitely stay for the 4.55pm Last Post Ceremony where they share the story of one of the names on the Roll of Honor. Allowed three hours for visit but could easily spend a day. We did a 1.5hr tour with tour guide Neil who was friendly and knowledge with interesting stories and facts.
The Australian War Memorial,"This place is huge, don't try to rush it. It's amazing, easy to navigate and even with lots of people there didn't seem crowded. If you have the chance to do one of the guided tours, I'd recommend that."
Awesome,I knew this building would be special but never realised how moving it could be. It makes you realise how lucky we are today with our freedoms that were secured through the blood of our forefathers. The halls commemorating WW1 and WW2 are beautifully presented - never at any stage glorifying war.
Wonderful,We wanted to see the War Memorial and it was exceptional. Very respectful and interesting.  We were given a one hour tour by a volunteer guide who was interesting and knowledgeable - it is the most amazing place and well worth visiting
Worth a visit!!,Memorial and Museum really worth a visit! Beautiful building (and place) to honor those who went to battle! I really like to visit this place! Going to Canberra?.... a must!
Icon in Canberra,"Tour is informative, everything is well maintained. Must visit for military enthusiasts, exhibition ranging from explosive pieces, grenade, hand guns to military vehicles, tank, aircraft. Everything is well designed."
Sombre monument,"This was my favorite site in Canberra. Not only is it a beautiful building, but houses great artifacts of the various wars Australia faced. It’s very busy with school kids during the week."
"Well done, go on weekend with kids","If travelling with kids,go on a weekend so they can use the Discovery Zone. My kids loved driving the helicopter and submarine and dressing up. It was very child friendly. Lots of war vehicles on display too. We spent time trying to find the name of a distant family member on the honour roll for WWI. We stayed for the last post ceremony which was very moving."
Tour of the war memorial,Went into areas would not normally have found. Guide told the life stories of various people as we went round bringing the place to life.
Fantastic,I loved  here it’s somewhere everyone should go tho there are some very sad parts too particularly the Len sifleet story and the recent deaths as you exit such beautiful grounds and well maintained couldn’t fault it.
Lest We Forget,"Superb , a place you will never forget. War is a terrible thing and this memorial shows the hardship and courage needed to survive in horrible conditions for all  our Diggers. Magnificent display."
Moving visit,"An interesting and moving visit to the War Memorial - extensive collections, probably requiring more than one visit. Would recommend staying for the last post."
War Memorial,"Very very well done. Visited once before about 30 years ago. Many exhibits, wonderful history. Extremely moving. Staff very helpful. Saw the change of guard. Poppys Cafe on site is good value and nice food"
Toy soldiers,The toy soldier displays of different battles are very dated and the interactive displays out of date
An absolute must see place,The whole experience was amazing but you definitely need 2 visits to see it all.  We were lucky to arrive just before a tour started.  They last for 1.5 hours and cover all the different areas.  The memorial hall itself is very beautiful and no expense has been spared in making it a moving and tranquil space.  It covers all the wars that the Australian military have taken part in from Crimea to Afghanistan.  After 3 hours I was at my limit so will be going back this week.  There are short films to watch when your feet are tired but so much information it is difficult to take it all in.
