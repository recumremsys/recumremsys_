New Displays of Scarecrows This Month,New scarecrow displays.  Be sure to look for the Grim Reaper of lost trademarks!  Make a reservation as attendance is limited.  Suggest early morning timing.
Amazing experience,Absolutely breathtaking experience. The employees were great and the scene was amazing. Enjoyed our time
Never disappoints ,"We returned after a long absence due to the virus. It was so great to be back. To cut down on  crowds, you now have time sensitive tickets (don’t be late, you’ll lose your spot). Gardens were so vibrant and alive. Rich color. Signs everywhere say masks required (but this is not enforced). Kids loved The Alice in Wonderland topiaries, especially Cheshire Cat and Chess Board. Large unmasked crowd in Children’s Garden. There is only one way in & one way out, they could limit the number of people in this section. Can’t wait for the Scarecrow Parade in October!"
Pretty but lacks customer service. ,Gardens are beautiful. The biggest issue we had was the lack of customer service. We bought tickets in advance for a time a slot (Due to Covid). We arrived about 15 min early and were told we had to wait while others bought tickets at the gate and were immediately given access. We passed the by the restaurant inside the gardens. My kids and I saw other kids and families eating ice cream at the restaurant. We went in and were immediately asked our intentions. We told the host that we wanted to get some drinks and allow the kids to get ice cream and were told to go to the snack bar because they would not let us in. This was not due to a lack of a reservation or space it was because we didn’t say we were eating dinner. This was obviously very disappointing to both my kids as we just walked by several families at the out door seating enjoying drinks and ice cream only. If they are going to require a min purchase then that needs to be notated at the door. We still would have spent money and tipped well.
A Botanical Garden MUST SEE!,"Even for two 30 year old women, we had a blast! This was the highlight for my friends birthday weekend, while we enjoyed the Alice displays we also appreciated EVERY other exhibit. Some notable highlights were the edible garden, the orchid greenhouse, the japanese garden &  the cascades garden! We enjoyed strolling the gardens, grabbing an adult beverage and enjoying the beautiful views!"
Incredible plants and landscaping,"The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a gem hidden in the middle of a big city. It is just north of downtown and has parking available. As of September 2020, they have metered entry every 15 minutes so you have to get tickets - easily done online. Members only on Mondays, so don't count on Monday. Currently there is an Alice in Wonderland theme with some of the more incredible massive illustrations from the story sculptured in plants - wow! The conservatory and orchid building was the highlight of the visit for us, but it didn't open until noon, so plan accordingly. Horticultural connoisseurs can easily spend 3 hours seeing the rest of the garden, so going first thing in the morning is fine."
Beautiful Holiday Lights But Very Crowded,"Every year for several years now the Garden has been doing Holiday Lights in the Garden.  They have been adding displays and making it more elaborate every year.  And each year, more and more people come to see it.  This year (2019) you needed to buy tickets for a specific day and time; as far as I am aware, all of the days sold out.  Tickets are not cheap either.  It has become THE thing to do on Christmas Day, although the traffic jams around Piedmont Park stretch across the entire Season!Many of the lights displays are now choreographed to music, quite a bit of it classical, some of it soundtracks to major motion pictures.  If you don't get tickets before they sell out, you can walk through Piedmont Park and see quite a lot of the light displays and clearly hear the music.  And you will see the endless sea of cars going into the garden while you are enjoying many of the displays!"
Wonderful Experience,It was a beautiful place to visit with family. My favorite thing is Alice in wonderland. I love edible garden as welll.
Nice place for the whole family ,Get your tickets online before hand. Trying to find tickets once you're in the park is a bad idea. They sellout very fast. You can purchase the one of Membership deals which isn't bad. We spend $105 for two adults and you get to visit as many times as you can during year from the date of purchase. There's a lot of exhibits. Don't expect the same ones as they switch them up. Really nice for the family. Military discount. Mask are required.
Great escape outdoors ,So the gardens are amazing.  They have a ton of floral and fauna to view. The trails are paved and a stroller easily can access everything.  They have a Alice in Wonderland design currently that is amazing. It’s hot for a mid day stroll but in the morning or evening I would highly recommend.
Very disappointed ,We planned our trip early to beat the heat of the day. We arrived at 9AM.  Cruised through everything.  Beautiful and happy til we got to the Conservatory. I was looking most forward to seeing the Orchids. It did not open til Noon.  Why!!!???  When gardens open everything should be opened!! No one in my party was willing to hang out 2 more hours to get into the building that should have opened at 9 AM. We were very disappointed.
No Covid 19 precautions enforced,Enforce requirements that adults wear masks and social distance. I had a terrible experience today with lack of Covid Safety precautions and will not return until the pandemic is over. Multitude of children without masks running and screaming everywhere. Parents unconcerned.
Beautiful Experience,"I always love coming here. The layout is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing and depending on the event it can be playful for the kids or elegant for a wedding!I want my wedding here. The space, the service, the grounds are all tailored to perfection.I have been here maybe 5 times or so- with family, with my boyfriend."
Unfortunate noise and air pollution,"I love the ABG but the gas-powered leaf blowers causing air and noise pollution 1/4 mile deep into Piedmont Park have got to go. Use electric blowers, brooms, and rakes!"
Beautiful gardens ,One of the few places open first week in July and it was absolutely worth the visit. Alice in Wonderland exhibit is amazing
Atlanta ,The Atlanta  botanical garden was AMAZING!! Come early to beat the crowd and the best photos. You want be disappointed. There's plenty to see and alot of walking..
Must See in ATL,"I love the Botanical Gardens and would visit often when I lived in Atlanta.  My only complaint is that it is expensive to visit, and therefore not accessible to the general public."
Garden in the city,"Atlanta Botanical Garden has become one of Atlanta's premiere attractions. You will discover the stunning beauty of nature -  featuring Outdoor Gardens, the Fuqua Conservatory and Orchid Center, Skyline Garden, Edible Garden, Lou Glenn Children's Garden, Kendeda Canopy Walk, and more. This is a family-friendly environment where appropriate attire is expected from the guests. No outside food and beverages are allowed. Stay on designated pathways at all times to observe social distancing. One thing that I didn’t like about our visit was that there were no signs telling people to observe social distancing all times. They need to assign people in each area of the park to guide where to go. The guy in the orchid area did a good job for opening doors to avoid people touching it."
Pleasant day at the gardens,My husband and I went to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens towards the end of June still during the Pandemic. We appreciated the precautions of strongly encouraging mask wearing outside and requiring it inside. We appreciated the limited number of people allowed in which made it very enjoyable. The gardens are beautiful. It is a lot of walking but it is wheelchair accessible. We spent about 2 hours total enjoying the gardens. It was just my husband and myself. My four boys would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. That's why I didn't take them!
"Great place for singles, couples, families","I love these gardens.  30 acres of winding trails, gardens tucked  away and a surprise to find.  Because of the pandemic, they had timed entrances but many people stayed a long while.  Which meant that as your slot arrived, the place was pretty packed.  My slot was 1pm-1;15pm on a Saturday.  Their restaurant was not open for in-house  dining but they have a to go restaurant featuring sandwiches and pastries.  Many had packed picnic lunches.  In the summer it can get really warm so be prepared for that."
Botanical Beauty,"Visiting Atlanta May 31, my friends and I decided to take a trip to the Atlanta Botanical Garden. For the love of scenery and complete serenity, VISIT!"
Atlanta gardens,"Beautiful garden, a little expensive, but worth it.  Themed topiaries change regularly and are fantastic. Some areas closed due to a Covid 19"
Even on a humid day,"Very beautiful clean place. No pests I probably saw one caterpillar lol It’s the end of the quarantine and I wanted to get out for my anniversary so we went there, the cooler months might be better for those who don’t like the heat right now because all the buildings are closed. The paths can be confusing so make sure you open your email📧 for the Map 🗺 because you could miss something you didn’t see. Wear comfortable shoes because there’s a lot of walking to do. Can’t wait to go back for Christmas 🎄"
Road trip ,"The Atlanta Botanical Garden was awesome. There was so much to see. There were bars and snack stations set up throughout the garden. I liked that it wasn’t overcrowded, so I would recommend visiting during the early hours. I would’ve gave it 5 stars but the on-site restaurant wasn’t kid friendly."
"Great way to spend a few hours, but not in the dead of Winter!","After seeing all the pictures and reviews, I was super excited to visit. Obviously, no one has gone in the dead of winter after it's been below freezing in January! They were tearing down the Holiday exhibits, the orchid exhibit was being set up, and there was little greenery other than in the greenhouses. The famous lady in all the pics was brown and black. Not quite what we expected. But, I learned how broccoli is grown, and my friend and I still enjoyed walking around the grounds and talking. But after paying full admission prices, it was a little  disappointing. Best part was the gift shop with all the 50% discounts on holiday gifts."
"Pre-spring bloom just okay, but this is still an incredible place","I live in Dallas and love going to the Dallas Arboretum. I think the Atlanta Botanical Gardens are similar, but slightly smaller. What stands above the crowd for me are the formed statues filled with dirt. There are the mermaid, phoenix and Alice-in-wonderland statues. They plant color coordinated grass, flowers and plants to bring them to life. Unfortunately, we were there in the first weeks of March when they were planting everything. In a month and through the summer and fall, they will be gorgeous.Most of the place was not in bloom, so it was a quick walk. The orchid facility was outstanding and worth a visit all by itself. Don't miss it. The suspended bridge over the forest canopy is a cool walk. Don't forget to find the three resident Chihuly glass sculptures.We spent about 1 1/2 hours here and saw all there was to see. It might have taken 3-4 hours if everything was in bloom. Put this on your list of places to visit."
Atlanta botanical garden,There is always something popping out to see here. We saw the Orchids and they were stunning. Always worth a trip.
Reciprocal Garden Member,I am a member of the botanical garden where I live--that allowed me to get into this space for free! I loved my time. My favorite part was the Orchid display. Parking was easy and I went on the perfect sunny spring day! My only complaint is that there isn't really a clear path through the garden or through the greenhouse--so you have to be strategic when looking at a map and planning your trip. I also ate lunch at the restaurant there which was really tasty! Good service too!
Surprised!!!!,"Spend some time in this place , quiet , close to nature , in the middle of the city, thier collection and the way is designed , make you relax and enjoy evrey minute of it. People very friend can help you in all areas."
An oasis in the city.,"The gardens are always a great place to get away from the hustle/bustle of the city.  Surrounded by beauty and nature, it's a relaxing, and inviting atmosphere.  And a must do each holiday season is the garden of lights.  They never disappoint.  The gardens are always a good choice for a visit any day of the week or year."
Never a BAd Time There,"Brilliant displays at -Christmas--er, ""winter holiday"" times. Elevated walkways, sparkling lights. It's a great place to go to get in the holiday mood."
Beautiful Flower Exhibition ,"Happy to be in town during the special flower show at the Atlanta Botanical Garden last month. The special exhibit consisted of flower arrangements, table top settings, Ikebana, etc. spread over two separate buildings. The space was large enough for the crowds and my mother who was in a wheelchair for the garden visit. A photography exhibit was also available. The orchid exhibit was lovely but a portion of it was a bit tight for a wheelchair so we skipped that section. The weather was lovely and the skies clear. We walked/rolled through all of the areas of the garden. I can imagine that the garden is spectacular when all of the flowers, plants and trees are in bloom and fervent. One area of the garden had many lights above the path; I can imagine that evening visits in Spring are magical. Several sculpture are scattered throughout the property and the children’s garden is especially inviting for young ones. The majority of the garden is wheelchair friendly so we were thrilled to be able to see most of it. There are benches and places to sit and admire the views. Multiple bathrooms are located throughout the space. A small cafe and more upscale restaurant are available on the premises. A popular gift store is available near the entrance. There is a drop-off point near the entrance for Uber/Lyft as well as visitor drop offs. Looking forward to coming back in the Spring one day."
Beautiful,It’s pretty chilly this time of year but I still enjoyed walking around the gardens. If you haven’t been to the botanical gardens it’s a must
Canopy walk drew us here.,This was delightful in late February with tulips and daffodils appearing but will be exceptional spring through January. We watched workers climbing trees to adjust nets above the canopy walk and to remove holiday lights. Would love to see that event if in Atlanta during the holidays. It looks spectacular.
"Great place to visit, excellent volunteers",This was one of the most enjoyable visits we have made to  Atlanta. The staff and volunteers were very helpful and knowledgeable. The plant collections were amazing.
Relaxing and beautiful walk on a sunny weekday to view orchids,"I stopped by this garden before my flight, that was the best choice I made during my Atlanta trip.  Since I came in late February, many tress are not in bloom yet, for example there was no canopy on the Canopy Walk, and the Earth Goddess was bare.. which makes this the perfect time to enjoy the orchids!  They do a really great job at placing the flowers and the background props, making many photo opt spots."
Afternoon visit ,"It was a great day to visit the gardens. While it’s the off season for a lot of flowers, it was still a gorgeous visit. Also, I was pleasantly surprised that there was a flower show going on during my visit, and that was great to walk around."
Great place to walk around,"There is no doubt that visiting this place at another time of the year would have you enjoy many more beautiful blossoming plants.  However, there is still lots to take in and enjoy on this beautiful site.The orchids are definitely spectacular and well worth the admission price!  We were lucky enough to meet a volunteer who explained the vanilla plant to us and told us how a pollinated flower takes 9 months to grow a vanilla bean.The other indoor exhibits are also neat to see.  We really enjoyed viewing a variety of frogs and never expected to see them so well camouflaged.The canooy walk is so pleasant and well organized and takes you to a beautiful fountain that is a ladies' upper torso with a waterfall coming out of her hand.There is great parking on site (affordable) and a restaurant and gift shop.  Washroom facilities are located throughout."
"Beautiful, but hard to navigate.","All of the indoor exhibits and biodiversity building were beautiful, well put together and very interesting. However, the map we received upon entry didn’t have anything labeled and we were lost most of the time we were there. Still worth the trip. Paid $20 per person upon entry."
Lovely even in February,"This is NOT the best time to see the Botanical Gardens, but we still very much enjoyed walking the outdoor grounds and experiencing the orchid displays.  We were impressed by the design of the gardens, which had numerous water features and allowed for 3 dimensional experiences (over the canopy walk, for example).  Although there wasn't much blooming, there were still plenty of places where we took pictures (and the Chihuly sculptures are lovely!).  I hope to come back at a warmer time."
Very Beautiful,This was a great place to visit. My daughter surprised her mom with a gift to spend the day at the Garden. It was so beautiful
"A colorful experience, even in the winter","We ventured to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens a bit ""off-season"" thanks to an open house-free admission day. In February in Atlanta, it is still a bit early for most of the spring blooms, but so many bulbs were just on the cusp of opening, and a few varieties were in bloom. The Edible Gardens were in excellent condition, full of color & texture. Special processes and many extra volunteers were deployed for the crowds, and everything ran smoothly (if slowly-- especially the wait to get in and parked!)  The volunteer corp were especially friendly and informative.  The star of the day was the blast of colors and scents from the huge Orchid and other tropicals exhibition in the Fuqua Observatory. Just wow!!"
Worth it every time!,"The Botanical Gardens is a must see when visiting Atlanta. They have different plants and flowers to showcase all throughout the year! When it's not crowded, the environment is very peaceful and calming."
Peaceful and Serene,The gardens are beautifully laid-out. There was much to see even in February. I can't imagine how beautiful it is in spring and summer! The orchid display was top-notch! Also enjoyed the very informative frog feeding session!
Always a Sight,"We go for their seasonal Garden Lights most years. Every season, the gardens do something different and always offer great visuals, good conversation starter pieces, photo ops to no end and is eco friendly. This past year, we went with friends who had kids & the lights were gorgeous, installations from previous themes like the Alice in Wonderland area brought the experience home. You can drink, eat and take in the gorgeous gardens and artistic insights. They also have value nights if you are on a budget!"
Orchids were stunning!,"We went on a very cold, rainy day but still enjoyed ourselves! The orchids and indoor greenhouses were a nice place to get out of the cold! I would love to return in the spring to see everything in bloom!"
A lovely respite,Tropical and desert habitats amazing.  Poison frogs remarkable.  Orchid show while we were there very well done.
Breathtaking Views during Christmas,"The entire garden is lighted up for Christmas from November 16 to January 11. Book tickets online in advance as there are limited entries daily. However, we saw that tickets were available on site also but the queue was pretty long. For viewing the holiday lights, the entry starts at 5 PM. Parking is available inside but is limited so if you reach early parking will be available inside the garden. The park is very busy and the parking may take 20-30 minutes. Parking charges are 10 dollars. However if the car has four or more passengers, the parking charges are 5 dollars.  Regular parking rates don't apply for event parking.Entry ticket is priced at 39.95 dollars for adult and 36.95 dollars for child 3-12 years old.Movement is one way. Wheel chair friendly.Food and drink kiosk just after entry but difficult to carry food drink and camera as you walk as some areas have dim lighting.The whole park is beautifully lit and the scene is breathtaking with multiple lights all over.Central vista has musical lights. Sitting benches provided in the area of musical lights and the adjoining bridge. Few eating places inside the park. Snack bar serves drinks, sandwich and hot dog. The Long leaf restaurant has seating but the menu is limited.  Around 7.30 PM one has to wait for an hour for getting a seat. A cafe in the same hall serves only sandwiches and drinks.Smores available.at 3-5 dollarsDowntown view is very goodRainforest and Orchid garden worth a visit. Kiosk just outside the orchid garden serves beer/wine and nuts.Washroom in the orchid garden is clean and there is no queue. All other washrooms, especially the one at the entry/exit has long queue.Time required is approximately 2-3 hours."
Where trees shimmer in the darkness,"I had been with my family to the Botanical Gardens this Fall (mid November 2019) to see the Garden Lights. Firstly, This super must-visit place is right in the middle of the City. Although I have visited the Gardens earlier, but this time my daughter who lives in Atlanta insisted that I schedule my annual trip from India for November so that I may get to see the delightful spectacle that the Garden Lights is.We reached the Gardens at about 6.30 pm before it got too crowded. Winter being close, it gets truly dark by this time. What we witnessed, rather experienced, was ethereal. The Garden springs to life with the decorative lights that stretch to cover the tall trees from top to bottom dancing in tune with some well thought music tracks. The hues of colours in display is amazing and change and move in sync with the music lighting up the garden.This apart, the other exhibits of the Garden have their own charm and attraction.An out-of-the-world experience indeed,"
Excellent Holiday Lights Exhibit,The garden and lights set to music is a terrific event which I highly recommend for all couples and families.
A MUST SEE,"The holiday lights were spectacular!  Each season, the garden has beautiful displays and it's a wonderful date night visit!"
One of the best Garden Lights!,"Went to the gardens for Garden Lights on Christmas night. Wonderful! Hanging lights were awesome.. Had campfire smores treat, my son enjoyed it.  A must if you are in Atlanta during the holiday season."
Dazzled by the beauty.,"We took my 10 and 12 year old grandkids to see the lights and beauty.  While the lights were wonderful, I wish we would have gone during the day.  I think the plants and flowers and decor is more visible in daylight.  I'll take them again in spring.  Well worth a visit."
Fabulous,"We went on a Thursday for cocktails in the garden, so very beautiful, I would go back again as it got dark and we missed things because we ate in the restaurant."
Their displays for their light show looked incredible!,"We stopped at this garden on our way to Florida. I wasn't expecting to see much at this time of year, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The orchid room was my favorite, with so many different kinds in bloom.  Just outside of that room was a pointsetta tree that was beautiful.  They had displays set up for their light show that were incredible!  They were much different than the lights I had seen in other gardens and zoos.  We would have planned a night visit if we were aware of this show.  I was told it is one of the biggest light shows around.  There were other flowers here and there in the garden.  Nice gift shop.  Lots of parking.  Lovely garden to visit."
Beautiful,"The lights are beautiful! Thankfully when we went it was a clear night and not so cold.  There are new additions each year but for the most part it is similar throughout the years.  Nonetheless,  it has so many picture perfect moments and great spots. No matter how fast you go through each display,  it still takes you a while to walk through the whole light show so go somewhat comfortable. P.S. traffic on Christmas day is the worst but that is too be expected."
be sure you go!,fabulous evening. something for everyone. The new additions each year are wonderful.  we could have stayed another hour and enjoyed enormously.
Good in all seasons!,Spring is our favorite in this garden with overflowing tulips & cherry blossoms. Summer is fun when the displays (Alice & Wonderland most recently) are fully grown in. Fall still has a lot of blooms & Greta views of the city. And the holiday lights in winter are great. Parking is very reasonably priced & you can access Piedmont Park as well!Tip: Make reservations for lunch to get the best tables or patio seating!
Simply gorgeous!,Visited for thanksgiving and wow!  Simply breathtaking and a must see if you are ever visiting Atlanta!
Such an amazing Christmas light show,"We were in town for Thanksgiving. After dinner we walked over. Good thing, the line to park/drive was insane. Very busy. We took our double stroller with the two kids and had no problem walking in and around with it. We were blown away by the amount of lights, shows, areas and activities. We had perfect warm weather (kept the kids happy and comfortable too). Had a few adult drinks and kids coco as well as roasted some s'mores (a kid favorite). We loved everything from the trains, to the orbs and green house, to the forest with the musical timed lights. So happy we went. I cannot say what it is like other than on a light show night, but I'd really enjoy going back on a regular day to see things in the light."
Holiday Lights are amazing,"My husband and I visited the Botanical Gardens for the Holiday Lights and we LOVED it.  We moved to Atlanta a little over a year ago and used to go to the Botanical Gardens in our previous state during the holidays, the beauty of the Atlanta Botanical Gardens Holiday Lights is a million times more beautiful. They really know how to put on a gorgeous holiday display.  We also had dinner at the Longleaf restaurant and that was wonderful as well. We look forward to making the Holiday Lights a holiday tradiiton for many, many years to come."
Gorgeous Christmas lights,This was such an unexpected surprise! We were looking for something to do our first night in town and since the weather was nice we decided to get tickets for this. It’s pretty expensive but totally worth every penny for the moments it creates. This is on par with the lights at Disney world and Dollywood for sure. My only complaint is that the parking attendants didn’t direct people to available spaces very well. Other than that it’s a perfect event!
"Overrated , overpriced ! Lacking any exhibits ","Lack of displays !  Hardly anything. I’ve  been to other festivals  that had 5 more times display and lights for half the  price !  I have no problems paying for a good show but this was  way Overpriced And only a few impressive things (forests ,orbs and Mother Earth) Everything Else was Elementary.  The observatory was lame and all you see is a  dark room with a bunch of leaves and a few lights.  Seriously?  The Chinese lantern festival w Xmas lights or misc lights are awesome. This was a joke.  I well say Mother Earth was nice, Forest canopy was cool and the orbs on the grass I haven’t seen but anything else was nothing.  Even the Alice in wonderland had two display . Smh . Trains ? Umm I can see that at the mall."
Best Christmas lights!,Drove from Alabama to see these Christmas lights. Best I have seen. Enjoyed walking around the gardens. Making s'mores was fun! Will be back next year.
Christmas at the Gardens,"We have started a tradition of visiting a different city each Christmas season. The gardens were well done, and yet I was hoping to see more nativity themed decorations. They did have an amazing light show."
Christmas lights,"We were amazed by the Christmas lights on Christmas Night.Alot of effort went into these displays.My only criticism is maybe an extra kiosk or two with drinks/food for this particular attraction, as the lines for these were a little bit long."
Even a winter's day is beautiful!,"The orchids display was simply amazing, and the poinsettia displays were 2nd to none!!  Wish I had gone back for the Christmas light display!"
Excellent Gardens,"We've been to a wide variety of botanical gardens, so we did not originally plan to visit the Atlanta Botanical Garden. However, because the weather ended up working out and we had some extra time, we decided to give it a quick visit. We were not disappointed.The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is large and very well laid out. There are wide variety of plants, walking trails, and pavilions throughout the gardens. We did not have time to visit the main conservatory, however, there was still plenty to see around the premises.At the time of our visit there was a special topiary collection in the gardens for the holidays and Alice in Wonderland. The topiaries were very well done and fun to look at. There was also a variety of Halloween decorations including displays made by individuals that you could vote on.There was a small discount for AAA members which saved a few dollars.The gardens are a bit off the beaten path.  We walked from the Arts Center MARTA station, which was a bit of a hike.  Consider using scooters to make it a bit faster.Overall, the Atlantic Technical Gardens is very well done and I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area."
Members for years,"This is my favorite place in Atlanta. We go at least once a month spending a few hours there each time. With rotating exhibits and the constant change of the plants the place is magical, all year long. The many features/shows of the garden just enhance the gardens themselves;  concerts in the green, the Garden holiday lights, the scarecrows, spring in all of its glory and wonderful sculptures (botanical, glass, stone). Oh yes and one of the most amazing collections of orchids you will ever see, as well as unbelievable indoor and out door gardens.   Mary Pat Matheson has made this garden into one of the top botanical gardens in the country and it never stops growing (small pun). My wife and I have maintained our family membership for over 15 years. It is our escape our joy and one of the best things we do together. The garden is expansive, great for kids (and grand kids) and wonderful for adults of all ages. Romantic, educational, beautiful and full of warmth. The staff is attentive and maintain a perfect environment. The paths through the garden give incredible views that change constantly. The gardens sit in the middle of midtown with great views of the city and of Piedmont Park, it has ample parking and easy access. You will not regret a moment you spend here.Did I mention, you have to see this place, visitors and residents alike, it is a must see."
Great Light Show,"Wow, what a spectacular event. We visited right after Thanksgiving, it felt like we were in line at Disney World, it was well worth the wait & well worth walking through the crowds on the Paths to see the lights. However, I would like to note that the lights structures themselves had no reference to Christmas, well, perhaps, one or two structures, the rest were holiday neutral."
Best in-season Atlanta attraction ,"During the blossoming months of April-November, the Atlanta Botanical Gardens offers one of the nicest, canopied walks in the city. Wandering through an azalea garden, or by the flowering goddess, the city disappears. On the other side of the gardens, the Conservatory and Sky view garden are an excellent end to the wooded stroll.An expensive entry, but worth it. Keep in mind Atlanta is HOT in the summer. It’s best to go on a cooler day, or even a cloudy day. In the real “dead of winter” (such as it is in ATL), very little is in bloom and the gardens can be underwhelming."
Spectacular lights,The lights were amazing - especially the ones set to music. Parking can be hit or miss so be ready to park off site. A shuttle is available.
Wonderland Fun,"I always love visiting the Gardens! There is always something fun and amazing happening when I go. The exhibit of Alice in Wonderland was perfectly done, and we enjoyed the restaurant on site as well. The serve apple cider when walking around that you can spike if you like :)"
Lovely day in the Fuqua Orchid House,"The orchids are just lovely right now.  I highly recommend spending some time in the orchid houses, breathing some good air and taking in the beauty of the flowers."
christmas Magic,"Just beautiful...Full of light, artistically created, Atlanta Gardens are always beautiful any time of the year you choose to go."
Down the rabbit hole,"This was my first visit. First and foremost let me say this place is awesomely beautiful. The theme at the time was of Alice in Wonderland. Beautifully done. The next offering you should make plans, to see. I'm not sure if what themes are in the future, but make you visit this beautiful place."
Lovely Garden lights,Went for the holiday lights.so beautiful.the kids loved every bit of it and had a nice time.overpriced in my opinion but worth seeing
Enjoyable,It can be a challenge to enjoy a botanical gardens in the winter but they opened up at night and turned the gardens in to a beautiful lights display! It was truly breathtaking. Parking was easy. S'mores packs were on sale and bonfires were ready. One section even had a lounge with a DJ and there were wine bars set up at various pockets.
Super clean and truly gorgeous,"Really fun way to spend a Saturday. The Botanical Gardens are immaculate and easy for a young family to visit. Parking was simple and affordable, and there's a nice split between various climate-based attractions (warning, can be a bit humid) and a nice, open wooded area. I would love to visit again on a day where I had more time, as this was a packed day and we only saw about half the gardens in roughly 3 hours, which is also impressive!"
Great Christmas night event,"Lights were fantastic! It was very crowded, but everyone was cordial. This is definitely q must-do at during the December holiday season."
A Special Experience at a Special Time of Year,"I renewed my membership to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens after my husband died, so that I could take neighborhood children there to see the Awesome Magical figures whose bodies are filled with plants.  At Christmas these same figures are done up in lights.  However, I agree with another commentator that the tree lights synched to music were most stirring.  The Camels and other creatures were so exciting seen in the daytime with plants as bodies, manes, dragon teeth etc. that I thought the lights on them although lovely were surpassed by the coordinated music and lights.  Yes, it was expensive and I thought value for the money spent.  My experiences at Longleaf Restaurant have been good and have found Maitre D' Dan Trevelino very accommodating on more than one occasion  especially on the extremely busy night that a friend and I went to the Gardens especially for the winter lights.  The place was slammed and yet the salmon we both had was perfectly cooked and the waitress attentive and for two older women to get such service is a pleasure in itself. There was even a S'mores Kiosk complete with fire to melt them with if you didn't want to go the restaurant as well as other snack bars.  I can't believe how well the garden staff kept the crowds moving in a very measured way and how clean they kept the bathrooms.  Kudos!  It was hard to get there as we went through rush hour traffic, but once we arrived the parking was straightforward and the magic started.  I won't go again this year for the lights, but will I go next year:  ""You betcha!"""
Double Charged for Parking,"Loved the lights. Getting hustled by the parking security on Christmas Eve was a different story. Paid $5 when we went in for a car of 4 people. Left and security guard made us pay another $10 saying our ticket didn't say ""paid"". Awful that staff would exploit people like that on a Christmas no less."
Nice Lights - Bad Restaurant ,"We visited the Christmas Lights at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens recently.I probably should not say “Christmas” lights sine there is very little of the many beautiful displays related to Christmas. All we saw in that regard were I think three camels and wisemen. Again, I think they were camels and wisemen! Nothing else that we saw of a Christmas nature! Maybe we were expecting it to be and maybe we should not have! But it’s not! But all the lights were very pretty.Was also very crowded but not to the degree of distracting - lines and crowds move smoothly. Was a very long wait in line of cars at entrance - it’s a popular place! And still was a couple of hours later waiting on a taxi. It’s a very popular and busy place! We also had reservations and ate at the Longleaf Restaurant - DO NOT recommend doing that. Very noisy. Very expensive - ($3 for bread!), no salad with expensive entrees. I had the salmon which was ok but over almost cold wild rice. A very limited menu. Use the other options of snack bars and “smores” booths! Again, a nice place to see lots of lights but not much related to Christmas and main dining facility a bit of a rip off. But do recommend a visit and probably a beautiful place in day time in spring, fall and summer just for the gardens. Not a “bah humbug” review, just an honest one!"
Fun but expensive,"My friend and I attended for the holiday nights. Tickets were just below $40 after taxes and fees, which I thought was too much for what you get. The holiday lights themselves were wonderful to look at, with typical Christmas decorations as well as fantasy style decorations (eg a dragon, and camels). The trip took us about an hour at a somewhat quicker than leisure pace. The tree lights synched to music were my favorite and very magical. Also, the toy train display was interesting.If you can get cheaper tickets, i would recommend. I think the experience was probably worth $25 max per person."
Amazing,"we came especially for the Christmas Garden light show now during the holidays and it is an absolute must see.Th display of lights, the efforts put into it, it is definitely worth the money."
Wow!  Very impressed with Holiday Lights and the expansion of the gardens!,I highly recommend the Holiday Lights exhibit at the Botanical Gardens which runs through the first part of the new year.  I went this year for the first time and was so impressed - the quality compares to and probably exceeds anything you may find in Vegas/NYC or other big city.  It had been several years since I visited the gardens and they have really expanded and offer much more now in terms of space.  The exhibit covers a large area of walking and really is spectacular.  The gardens also now has an on-site restaurant as well as a lounge and snack area.  Parking is convenient and it really is worth a visit to any exhibit when you have a chance.  A lot to see!
Great night out,"Not sure what the gardens are like during the day, we went for the lights show evening. Very impressed by the level of decorations and exhibits. Very well done and once again another attraction well worth its price"
Bold and Beautiful,"The Christmas Light Festival in Atlanta, Georgia was spectacular. The entire grounds of the garden was filled with wonders of the Holiday spirit. My favorite was the raining lights and the poinsettias on display. During the summer season, the Butterfly Conservatory is extremely stunning. The Botanical garden is a wonderful experience for the entire family all year round."
Amazing Christmas Lights,I can't say enough about how spectacular the Christmas lights are at the Botanical Garden.  Everyone should have the opportunity to see this in person!!!
Light show with the Boo,It was impressive and amazing! We had the hot chocodates with a bit of minty taste. It wasn't very nice but it help me stay warm while walking around the place. Christmas feels the air..I'm loving it!
Great Christmas season outing ,"The Garden Lights Holiday Nights display at the Botanical Garden is great. If you are in the area during the holidays do not miss it. Be sure to buy a s'mores kit, roast a marshmallow and enjoy this childhood memory. This outing is good for families and out-of-town guests. Food is also available. Plan on about 2 hours for this activity and arrive early as the line to get in and park starts to back up quickly."
Hydrangeas are gorgeous in June!,"I visited the Garden on June 1 especially to see the blooming hydrangeas.  They have the most beautiful blue hydrangeas and pink ones too along a walk through the woods.  Shady and cool with large arrays of blue flowers; so beautiful!  Definitely worth a special trip if you can hit it at the peak of blooming season.I also spent some time looking at their popular topiaries: Alice in Wonderland with the Cheshire cat, a phoenix, a dragon, a shaggy dog, and a camel caravan.  There is also the Alice in Wonderland chessboard near the large fountain below the orchid conservatory, with the always LATE for an important date(!) rabbit in the middle of the fountain!  Other perennials and cacti were blooming too, along with the water lillies in front of the Fuqua Orchid Conservatory.  Really a great visit!"
Worth It,"We came here while visiting Atlanta after hearing it was a top ranked attraction.  We absolutely loved the Garden Lights, Holiday Nights.  They really go all out.  It features the world’s largest curtain of synchronized light and sound, and as you walk through you are literally surrounded by lights that “dance” to classic hits such as Flight if the Bumblebee, Wizard of Oz, Beethoven, What a Wonderful World, Pink Panther, and more.  My 9 and 12 year olds thoroughly enjoyed it.  You won’t be disappointed.  Just be warned, it is VERY crowded, so you need to buy tickets in advance n the weekends.  There is also quite the traffic back up trying to get into the event and the parking garage, so I would suggest walking there if you are able."
Christmas light show is beautiful!,"Worth visiting every season as the displays change. The Christmas light show is stunning, impressive and makes you smile."
Beautiful,My husband and I have been a couple times. It is a wonderful and romantic stroll. Once for a roses and once was for wince. Dress cute but wear your good walking shoes. There is a lot to see and a lot of ground to cover by foot.
Beautiful Garden,Absolutely fabulous. The lights are amazing and the harmony of the sound and the lights together is extraordinary.Great experience
Wow!,"A group of 5 of us wanted to have an “experience”, initially I was not excited about the botanical gardens because of the time of year.  But!  They have a light show happening. I bought the premium tickets so we could change the date if we needed to because of weather.  Little did I know that with the premium ticket we got a free drink (they are speendy for what you get) and we got THREE D GLASSES!  They were such a hit, we expected to spend an hour to max two hours at the gardens, we were there for over 3 hours.  It is worth the $5 for the upgraded tickets we were ooohing and awwing so much people were looking at us funny, then we let them try the glasses and they too were thrilled. Well worth going.Very kid friendly!"
Atlanta Botanical Gardens,We had such a wonderful time viewing the holiday lights! This was my first time there and will definitely will go back at spring time to see all the blooms. This is something for sure to take out of town guest too and if you live in the area and haven’t been. The cleanliness of everything exceeded my expectations. The women’s bathroom was clean and lady working in there picked up every piece a trash that fell on the floor . I really noticed that bc I’m a clean person and I was really impressed with all the cleanliness around the grounds as well.
Absolutely wonderful and a feast for the eyes,"Wanted to get out and take a long walk for exercise, and thought it might be fun to do this at the botanical garden. Turned out to be a great decision. The garden is well laid out, the flora delightfully diverse, the visual delights more than satisfying."
Holiday Lights,"We went to view the Holiday Lights with a large group.  Unfortunately, buses are required to drop off guests in the rear of the property.  The lights were lovely and definitely, ""Holiday"" not Christmas!  The music at one section by a DJ was not even holiday music, just modern beats not agreeable to these more mature ears."
Wow! What an Amazing Sight to see!!,"Bought our tickets online before we went, saved money that way! We went on Saturday, November 30th 2019 and our night was nothing but fantastic and fabulous! We decided to book and stay the night so we wouldn't have to worry with parking. We stayed at the W Hotel Midtown, it was only about a 10 min walk away. Highly Recommend staying there is you don't wanna get caught up in all the traffic! We walked there faster than the traffic was moving and once we got to the entrance they had a sign up that said ""lot full"" so I do not know where people parked after that? Since I had pre-bought our tickets online we didn't have to wait in any line! Walked right in! Was handed a map of the lights, and we were on our way! The lights are just amazing to see! We took our time, and took it all in! Made for a really relaxing night! My husband and I stopped and had some Hot Cocoa with a splash of Irish Cream, it was really good! Our daughter roasted herself a s'more (extra charge of course). Our time here was really fantastic and we will probably be making this a yearly family event! If you are thinking of going here don't hesitate buy your tickets online and go you will not regret it!"
"Garden Lights, Holiday Nights","We went to the Garden Light, Holiday Nights to cap off Thanksgiving Day and had a great time. The weather was fantastic and the lights and music were incredible. This is an annual must do for the holidays."
Beautiful!,Loved the visit! The Garden lights were just amazing. I especially love the Woodlands lights that changed to the sound of music! I have always wanted to visit the gardens and so glad that it did not disappoint! Looking for to my next trip to visit again!
Christmas dream,Must see attraction. Great atmosphere. Drinks smores and amazing light shows. Definitely makes you feel that warm xmas feeling. Will be coming back.
Holiday light show fantastic ,"The holiday light show runs mid November  to early January. Adult tickets start at 29  (for members). But well worth it.We went as family this evening.  Went early (5pm opening) to start before sunset. It took us full two hours to see everything.  The section with lights and music synchronized was the highlight. They had staff all over to help with questions and directions.  They now added some one way sections for simplification . In at least two places they had staff set up to take pictures of you with your camera Dont buy the 3d glasses, only filtered lights into snow flakes or snowmen.  Smores were great. Whole family enjoyed the evening Parking may fill, so go early or wait 2+ hours for it to ease up. Back entrance to parking may be better."
Go see the light show!,"I have not been during the day, but the holiday light show is amazing. Go early because it gets packed and parking can take forever."
Christmas light show is excellent,"The Christmas light show is incredible.  The exhibit is open from November to January and well worth the visit.  My only negative is the displays are scattered all over the gardens and it would be very easy to miss something as the directions are non-existent, and the various trails need signage.   The grounds include a gift shop, a couple of merchandise kiosks, a couple of food and beverage locations, and places to grill your own smores."
FANTASTIC,The lights during the Christmas season are spectacular !  The synchronized music with lights was lovely.
Great light show,"A++++++==Lights in trees with music is amazingBring good shoes, a lot of walking.Parking is tough, go early.Beautiful place."
Go for the Holiday Lights!,"Although the gardens are beautiful any time of year, the absolute best time to go is during the Christmas holiday. Usually this begins mid-late November and goes all the way through beginning/mid January. The lights, displays and music are phenomenal! They really do an amazing job. There are also bars set up in multiple areas so you can grab a drink and see what the place has to offer during the happiest time of the year! Non alcoholic beverages like hot chocolate and hot apple cider served as well."
Wonderful!,Very much enjoyed this place! The lights are spectacular. We went on value night so it was a bit crowded but not too bad. I do recommend to not get the premium package with 3D glasses. We paid extra for them and I only put them on one time. You can pay for a s’mores pack to roast your own marshmallows over an open fire for $5. Marshmallows and Graham’s were stale. But the experience was neat.
Christmas Lights Extravaganza,"Made reservations on line for this event. Staff begin putting up lights a couple months ahead. There are places to stop for a hot drink or to make your own smores. The lights are stunning and digitally coordinated with the music. Creative displays. We arrived at dusk and enjoyed part of the exhibit in the diminished light. We retraced our steps later after dark and felt treated to a brand new display. Park staff clear all the visitors out at 4pm, and light patrons begin arriving at 5 pm.  Great for couples, and also fun for families with kids."
Weekend trip to Atlanta,Upon arriving to Atlanta my first stop was the Botanical Gardens. The grounds were very well kept and they were preparing for an evening event. I could tell that they had lights everywhere for maybe a light show of some sort throughout the gardens but the Gardens closed at 5 p.m. I would have liked to have been able to stay at night to see the various sculptures lit up for the holidays. But overall the botanical gardens was very nice I wish I would have come in the spring or summer months where I could see everything in full bloom. When I return to Atlanta during the spring or summer months I would definitely go back again to visit. A must-do for nature lovers.
Must see in the Holiday Season,Awesome lights and cool effects. The green lasers in the hothouse withe frogs reminded me of what a dark rainforest must be like. Don’t get the 3D glasses. You’ll use them for 5 minutes. Do get the hot chocolate with kaluha.
Excellent lights,Relaxed wandering through the gardens during the day. We decided to return to see the xmas lights. The bridge walk was amazing. By far the most mesmerizing light show we have ever seen. Would highly recommend visiting
Amazing Lights!,We came for the second day of the holiday light show. It was indescribable and I’m so glad we didn’t skip it. It was wonderful and festive. We even saw a marriage proposal. Everything was beautiful. Children would love it.
Christmas Lights,Wonderful! Expensive but worth it!   Choreographed light displays with music were absolutely fantastic!
Cool place to visit in Atlanta,"This garden is huge! They constantly have a lot of cool different themes, so you’re not always seeing the same thing when you go. It’s also great for kids and lots of places to take really nice pictures. They also have a cool event every Thursday during the summer called drinks in the park, with a live band, and lots of drinks. What I love most about this place is that I was proposed to there in front of the Alice in wonderland queen of hearts exhibition!"
Beautiful garden,Went for a short park walk and almost missed this because I was already tired from walking - now I'm really happy I didn't. This garden is truly beautiful. Every detail was done with such love and care. All the sculptures are created together with nature and whole place has this pure untouched vibe. And luckily there are a lot of benches where you can enjoy the scenery. There is also a closed part with tropical plants. But was too humid for me.
Beautiful gardens!,Went to the botanical gardens on a fellow tourist’s suggestion and glad we did.  We only had a couple hours before it closed but was able to enjoy the entirety of it.  Wish we could have seen it at night with all the lights they were putting up.
Large & Diverse Garden with a good restaurant,"We were here in November so, of course, it wasn't quite as Grand as it might have otherwise been; but it was still very nice.It is a very large facility and lacks, I think, enough help to give it the love it needs. I did see some volunteers there so they are reaching out in what ways they can.They have a very well stocked Orchid research facility and an indoor African desert garden with plants and tree's you'll never see anywhere except Africa of course. An indoor rain forest and 30 acres of walkways through the flora and fauna of Georgia's natural habitat. Along with a number of water features too.I do think they are a bit starved for help as some of the facility seemed a bit tired or over used or something.The food at the restaurant was very good. My wife had some kind of chocolate desert. It was proclaimed as decadent! which is quite a compliment coming from a chocolate connoisseur. I had the squash soup and it was extremely good & tasty. Prices were average I think. All in all a good stop for us."
Exquisite gardens with extensive variety and exceptional attention to detail,We spent about 4 hours exploring this vast garden and were delightfully impressed. The massive topiaries are beautifully planted with colorful flowers and greenery - they are the best I have seen anywhere. The edible garden is inspiring - who knew marigolds can be part of a salad? The forest canopy walkway is stunning as you meander through the tree tops then along waterfalls. The children's garden offers a great space for rambunctious youngsters to explore. The train garden is a highlight. The orchid house is fascinating. There is something for everyone.  All of the gardens are well maintained with a focus on the details.  Highly recommend a visit.
Expectacular even in Fall,"Fall is not a good season to visit any Botanical Garden in the north of the USA, a lot of plants are sleeping. But even in Fall this place is magnificent. It is huge. We love every little space in the garden.We missed the colorful Earth Goddess and the Alice in Wonderland figures. There were only the estructures without plants because of the Fall season. But the camels were beautiful.The restaurant Longleaf is really good. It has food for everybody, meat lovers and vegetarians. If you can select the season, Sprint and Summer are the best for the plants. But if you are in Atlanta in Fall like we were, go to de gardens anyway."
Faculty Retreat,"What a relaxing atmosphere in which to spend a faculty retreat.  After meeting, a walking tour of the Botanical Gardens was a wonderful way to end our retreat."
Beautiful oasis,"A great way to spend half a day in Atlanta. Gardens are well laid out- not huge so easily walkable. There are several sculptures which are very interesting, a canopy walk, indoors orchid and tropical plant gardens. Landscaping is lovely and lights were being put up for the holidays. Would love to see it at night. Highly recommend if you enjoy picturesque outdoor spaces!"
Amazing,"The Christmas exhibits, music was phenomenal.  A beautiful family experience. Great for children ages 4 and up"
Halloween Scarecrows were great,"We actually went twice to the Botanical Gardens.  We went with a friend on a very busy day, so we just had lunch and left because it was so crowed.  She gave us tickets to return so we did on a weekday.  The scarecrows were really neat.  Such imagination and time went into creating them.  We missed the Alice's Wonderland because we left on that Sunday which was it's last day, but I prefer less crowded and calmness so we were pleased to return on a weekday even though we missed this.They were in transition putting up Christmas lights and getting the earth goddess ready for the holidays.  She was bare of foliage and lights.  I would love to return when she is either decorated for Christmas or has lots of foliage. It was nice to see her anyway.I do not know the admission cost as our friend gave us tickets. The gift shop was nice as well.  I think this is worthwhile."
Not just flowers!,The botanical garden has alot going on other then just walking around the garden. We went to see the pumpkin carving competition. What fun and creative pumpkins. The scarecrows around the gardens were really interesting and unique.  My favorite is still the imaginary worlds.  A must see if you visit Atlanta.  The Christmas lights are great too.
Eye Tantalizing!!,"Beautiful collaboration of art, lights and nature. The Garden is ever changing and never disappoints. A true treat during the holiday Season!!!"
Mesmerizing gardens during the winter holidays!,"If you are a lover of holiday lights as well as botanical gardens, you will love this place, Not many people, so lots of opportunity for quiet, beautiful, holiday-fancy sights while strolling the gardens!  Beautiful gardening ideas abound!"
Most beautiful garden,We will be there every season because there are always have different flowers and the shows.Our family really appreciate it and love it very much.
A Night to Remember,It was my fiancé and I first visit and it was a night of beautiful lights and soothing music. We really enjoyed the kissing booth.  We will visit again.
Amazing Botanical Garden,"Wow this is a beautiful and huge botanical garden. Unfortunately I could only visit for a little over an hour on my last day in Atlanta. It was sunny with blue skies, not the best for photos, but that was the only time I could visit. Also, they are transitioning from autumn to Christmas, getting rid of floral displays and putting up lights. I am sure the light show will look amazing!! If I lived in Atlanta I would buy a membership and visit every week.I didn't get a chance to see the entire garden, it is really big. They have so many different areas, a huge greenhouse/conservatory, lots of cute statues and art around the garden, fountains, etc. It's really well planned and displayed and quite amazing.There was a scarecrow display throughout with dozens of scarecrows that were made by local groups. They were cool.Sorry to have missed the Alice in Wonderland topiaries, although there are a few left.Hopefully I'll be back in Atlanta some day and can visit this amazing garden again."
Good time of year!!,"I have been to the Botanical gardens a couple of times before, but, this time I saw they had lile a Halloween expo and were getting ready for Christmas!!! it was beautiful and worth it!!!"
Fun to do,If you like gardens this is the place to visit. Great exhibits and helpful guides. We go several times a year.
Gorgeous and Charming Gardens!!!,"The gardens are incredible, being that I am a plant person I truly enjoyed every minute here! The Alice in Wonderland Installation was breathtaking, as well as all the other topiaries such as the dragon, mermaid and phoenix. If I lived in the Atlanta area I would definitely become a member. A must see if you visit Atlanta!"
Totally worth the time and money!,"My 7 yr old and 15 yr old visited last Sunday afternoon. We were absolutely in awe of how lovely the gardens were — the goddess, the Alice in Wonderland, the green houses etc. I think I said Wow! a thousand times. It was beautiful. There shady places and sunny spots and places for my little one to run and spin and play. We spent about 2 hours there and we didn’t quite see everything. Parking is very reasonable as well. Highly recommend!"
Would give ten stars if I could,"We lucked out with a gorgeous day and arrived in time for Alefest - bar setups and live music from 5-9 pm. Sadly my party didn't want to stay long enough to see all of the lights come on (their design looked amazing) but highly recommended. The topiary exhibit was impressive, the fall decor was great and appropriate (pumpkins and gourds of every description), and the scarecrows amusing, creative, beautiful, or charming. The gardens and views are great on their own. If I lived in Atlanta I'd be a member for sure."
Wow is ALL!,Not much to say but incredible! The endless displays and the areas dedicated to the Orchid and even some natural little animals important the environment were a nice surprise. This is a large facility and can be a lot of walking. They did offer powered scooters for those who need them for $25 for the day. My wife did use one it was great. They have a great little café on site and offed cocktails in several areas in the park. Great for a stroll in the Sun Don't miss his one!
Excellent,"We went to the garden in October to make sure that we saw the Alice in Wonderland exhibit.  It was a beautiful day and the exhibit was outstanding.  We also enjoyed the scarecrows thru out the garden and the pumpkin displays.  We have enjoyed gardens all over the world, and we rate this as one of the best in the USA.  We want to return in the spring."
Be a tourist in your own city!,"After living in Atlanta for 18 years, I finally went to the Atlanta Botanical Garden to experience the beautiful Alice in Wonderland installation. I went during the week in the afternoon and had the garden mostly to myself which was perfect. There are plenty of rotating and seasonal installations in the downtown oasis and I highly recommend visiting this beautiful garden!"
Alice in Wonderland ,We visited last year for imaginary worlds exhibits so we knew we couldn’t miss this years Alice in wonderland exhibit !!! It was Gorgeous!! The scarecrows from different businesses & groups were awesome too!! I can’t wait to see what’s next !!
Great fall visit,"We visited in October to see the Wonderland topiaries and scarecrows. We loved walking around, and it was not a crowded day. The city views juxtaposed with the gardens is beautiful."
Beautiful oasis in the midst of the city,The Alice in Wonderland topiaries made the visit especially memorable.  They are just outstanding.  The gardens themselves are also quite beautiful but the special exhibit is what really brings the WOW factor.
Spectacular!,The gardens boasted the Alice in Wonderland living exhibit when we visited and they were fantastic! The gardens have something for all ages and is well worth a visit!
Excellent value,"We traveled to Atlanta to see the Alice in Wonderland sculptures.It wasn't complete, but there was so much to see anyway. Scarecrows of all kinds and a gorgeous giant phoenix.  The place is huge and you could immerse yourself in your surroundings and just stay all day. There were lots of places for small children to run around in the grass and plenty of seats in the shade. It was a great way to spend a beautiful day. Take your water bottle. We plan to go back for the Christmas lights."
so much more than you expect,The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is spectacular especially in nice weather and at Christmas time. They have so many varieties of orchids and great places to sit down and enjoy the beauty of the gardens. They also have a great restaurant. A must do when visiting Atlanta!
Alice's Wonderland and Scarecrows in the Garden,"Atlanta Botanical Garden is beautiful on its own, but it keeps things fresh by having temporary displays.  This time it was Scarecrows in the Garden and Alice's Wonderland.  Honestly, I really didn't expect what the Scarecrows would look like.  Some were humorous, others macabre.  Alice's Wonderland on the other hand, was excellent.  Topiaries like sculptures of wonderful creatures like dragons, and the Cheshire Cat.  I would tell you to go, but the exhibit ends this month.  I went on Columbus day and it was super busy.  The person who said there wasn't much color must have gone to a different garden than me.  There were lots of flowers.  And butterflies."
Pleasantly surprised,"We visited in May, right at the beginning of summer, and spent a lot more time here than we expected. There are so many different gardens to walk through, and each was full of flowers. I especially loved the orchid house, and all of the different types of orchids they had, as well as the rose garden. When we went, there were different Alice and Wonderland themed flower sculptures throughout the gardens, and they were truly impressive. It would be cool to come back at a different time during the year to see what special installations they have!"
Disappointed ,We visited over Columbus Day weekend and were disappointed there wasn’t much color.  I am guessing best time is spring and early summer - or the evenings during the holidays when the lights are up and on.   The scarecrows were interesting and detailed as well as the shrub/plant/flower caricatures.  A lot of families with small children - plenty of space for walking in the middle of the city.   Recommend - but I am guessing it’s better at certain time of the year.
Nice area ,If you love arts please stay in the botanic garden for a half day and you have to spend another half day in the museum
Awesome for people of all ages,"I took my out of town guests here and we had a great time.  It was October so there was a wonderful scarecrow exhibit plus ""The Alice in Wonderland"" exhibit which was awesome.  I had one visitor who had to rest between walking and there were plenty of benches in the shade to rest. You need to have a reservation to eat at the restaurant on site during a weekend but you can go to the counter and pick out salads, soup & sandwiches which were very good.  I loved it all so much that I almost bought a season pass."
Beautiful tranquil place,"Loved the creativity we saw during the Alice in Wonderland exhibit!  Easy to navigate around. No parking available on site though (lot full all day), had to walk through the giant adjacent park to get there and had only 2 hours until closing to visit.  Still worth it though."
Highly recommend! ,"My 7 yo dtr and I visited the Atlanta Botanical mid September while they had the Alice and the Wonderland Mosaic sculptures.  The sculptures were amazing and they were spread out over the garden like a treasure hunt. Even without the special exhibit,  the garden is fabulous.  The children's garden and play area was engaging for kids of various ages. The Earth Goddess is a permanent mosaic sculpture and not to be missed. The conservatory with the orchids was also a favorite."
Fall Break Highlight ,"Our family of 12 and eight-year-olds had an amazing time at the Gardens. We spent about four hours and got to see pretty much everything, including lunch (they serve alcohol and let you walk around in the gardens with it!). They have a fun thing going on right now for fall where you get to vote on your favorite scarecrow and the whole family really had fun choosing. The topiaries are amazing!  Definitely one of the best botanical gardens I’ve been to."
Wonderful Afternoon,This garden is absolutely beautiful and worth the slightly spendy entrance fee. Lots of diverse plant material and really interesting exhibits. Nice little cafe for a quick bite or beverage.
Alice in Wonderland exhibition,"This was my first visit to the Botanical Garden. It’s a beautiful space to explore, revel in its serenity and gaze at phenomenal garden spaces. We were lucky to attend during an Alice in Wonderland exhibit and were amazed at the creativity and beauty of each piece."
A good plan for the weekend,The Botanical Garden is amazing! It is such a good place where you can spend 2 or 3 hours. The exhibition is beautiful as well as all the flowers in display. I truly recommend if you are visiting Atlanta. You can also visit the Piedmont Park wich is by side the Botanical Garden.
Alice's Wonderland Sculptures and Halloween Scary Arrangements,"This season the sculptures are truly fantastic and impressive in size.  Also, many groups have created individual arrangements for Halloween that demonstrate much effort and ingenuity. A trip not to be missed.   Suggest going during the week and arriving at opening before busloads of school kids if that is your preference."
Wonderful Unexpected Fall Competition..,"Beautiful location, Nice neat gardens, pounds and green houses.Fall Halloween creative competition..  It is very nice experience specially at cool autumn weather.. GO with kids and they will have lots of fun!"
Absolutely Gorgeous!,Visited in the spring and this place was in full bloom and absolutely gorgeous.  I visit Atlanta pretty regularly and had no idea this place was located in nearby the park and behind the neighborhood my friend used to live in.  It's truly a peaceful oasis in the middle of a bustling city.  So much to see - plan for a few hours to stroll through so you don't miss anything.
Such a wonderful place,"I absolutely love that!! If you are a lover of plants, I would highly recommend that. It is just a giant park with people who love what they do. When I went there they had Alice in wonderland theme and it was just beautiful. I would definitely check out their Orchids area just breathtaking. If i would have live in Atlanta i would get their yearly membership. It is just a very scenic park and absolutely perfect for taking memorable pictures."
Great way to be outdoors in a beautiful place,There are many interesting things to see in the nooks  and corners of the Garden! There are currently very creative scare crows and all forms of pumpkins . There are amazing huge  flower sculptures of Alice in Wonderland and even a wooly mammoth thrown in.  Kids will like to see the live frog exhibitions of all colors of tiny frogs- including yellow! There is a tropical rain forest to stroll through and a huge show of orchids .There is an outdoor pavilion that has a wonderful view of the Atlanta skyline. There is also a lively restaurant to have a meal in the midst of the garden. There are sparklingFountains and a nature walk on a raised bridge over a wooded area . Coming soon is the display of Christmas lights that gets better every year.The Garden Shop is full of lovely gifts for yourself and others. All during the year the Garden has a wide variety of educational programs for all ages.
Unbelievable Living Sculptures,"Anyone visiting Atlanta should visit the Botanical Gardens.  It will take your breath away.  It did mine.  My family spent the day there and couldn't get enough of the conservatory, the orchids were amazing and the grounds studded with topiaries.  Throughout the Gardens are huge topiaries that are works of art.  Every time we turned a corner, there was another breath stealer whether it was a camel caravan, the Cheshire cat or a Phoenix rising from the ashes."
Awesome! ,"We had so much fun visiting the Atlanta Botanical Garden. The different types of gardens were all beautiful, and we loved all the season fall displays and pumpkin displays. The orchid, desert, and jungle rooms were all very neat too. It was so fun just to walk around looking at everything. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back!"
We loved it!,"It was great to walk around & not know what to expect around the corner! So exciting. We will be back I hope the theme changes a little tho don’t want to go & see the exact same things. We took so many pictures I had to delete some. Wasn’t very impressed with Alice she was kind of a blob laying in the grass, that was disappointing."
Wonderful experience,"I am a member, but still the entrance fees for non-members are totally reasonable.  We generally go at Christmas time to see the light which are FABULOUS.  There are events all year round and it’s all lovely...check out the web site. Also, the restaurant was quite good when I ate there last, but it’s been a while."
All we saw was a passed-out Alice.,"We went on 10/4/2019 for my birthday, specifically for the Alice in Wonderland exhibit. The White Rabbit and Chessboard were great. Alice and the Cheshire Cat? Not so much. They were incredibly small and my husband said that Alice looked like a body that had been found on an episode of The First 48. Why they have her laying down is beyond my scope of measure. She's like spray-painted overgrowth. For the price, we were really dissapointed. I'm guessing it's better at night but they really failed on 2 of the biggest characters of AiWL. Terrible. Wait for spring."
Our first visit and we cannot wait for our next,"My husband and I moved to Atlanta almost a year ago and we are big fans of Botanical Gardens. We had heard from many people how beautiful they were, so I saved a visit to be on my birthday.  We were so happy to have spent the day there. The gardens are stunning!  The Alice in Wonderland exhibits are amazing works of natural art that one could spend hours looking at and enjoying.  We dined at the Longleaf restaurant for lunch and the staff could not have been nicer. The food was delicious and served beautifully.  We loved everything we saw at the gardens and have already purchased our tickets for the holiday lights."
family visit,"Beautiful place, just wish I lived nearer I would be a regular visitor [UK]  .   we visit here a couple of weeks ago with my cousin who lives in Atlanta, we spent a few hours walking round it was a beautiful time, really amazing place."
A Wonderland of Flowers,"The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is a magnificent experience, indoors and outside. Alice in Wonderland themed topiary added to the experience. Be prepared to do some walking (hills and bridges included) if you intend to see everything, which is our recommended was of experiencing this unique and large garden complex. Wear comfortable clothing and dress accordingly for the weather. A good restaurant is on premises, so you can get a respite from a sultry summer day in Atlanta and refresh yourself. To do it right, allow about three hours or more."
Beautiful Garden - Must See Place in Atlanta ,"This is our main reason to visit Atlanta,  Ga. We read lots of good reviews and saw lots of beautiful pictures from this Botanical garden. We came to this place around 10 am, we spent around 4 hours walking around this garden.It was amazing place, beautiful garden, especially all the plant sculptures they have in there, they are so marvelous. We are so lucky to see Imaginary World theme!! In short,  they are well worth to drive 14 hours to visit!!!"
Great Saturday Tour,"We had a relative in town and decided to visit the Gardens since we'd never been before.  Alice in Wonderland themed creations were beautiful.  We spent almost three hours walking the gardens and then decided to have lunch in the restaurant before we left at 3pm.  The food was delicious, I had the chicken salad sandwich ant it was huge.  My son enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwich and our bill for a group of 4 was less than $55.  The weather was nice and there was plenty of shade throughout the garden.  Parking was reasonable and we were able to find a spot when we arrived at 12noon.  There was a gift shop on site as we exited but we opted not to tempt ourselves."
Best in spring but still pretty,With different blooms throughout the year we’ve found this place to be the most beautiful in spring when the tulips & Cherry Blossoms are in full bloom! Summer was great as the Alice & Wonderland series came alive & many other plant statues. Fall finds many of these things dying off & lots of lights starting to be hung as September ends & fall truly begins. Tip: Plan to eat lunch at the restaurant on site (reservations recommended)
Amazing place ,"The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is huge with wonderful sights at every turn.  This is a place to visit over and over.  The exhibits span amazing, pretty, peaceful, and other emotions.  Go for sure."
Bought a membership for the price of one visit!,"The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a great place to wander through when the weather is nice.  We went for chocolate covered weekend and really enjoyed the cooking demonstration at the outdoor kitchen.  Also liked trying all the different types of chocolate.  There's plenty to explore -- including a playground for the kids.  And for my Japan-obsessed daughter, there was also a Japanese garden.  This is a large, well done botanical garden."
Atl Botanical Gardens,"Extremely nice gardens, staff, and service. Family and kid friendly. Great restaurants. Plenty of shaded areas with seating."
Worth a long visit,"I spent a lovely 3 hours exploring ABG, and loved it. The Canopy Walk through Storza Woods is thrilling; Chihuly sculptures wonderful; children’s garden enchanting; Fuqua Conservatory collections enthralling; topiaries extraordinary; planters overflowing with tropical plants charming; gardens full of blooms. Longleaf restaurant is worth the wait. Plan on up to 20 minutes to find parking on a busy weekend."
Lovely green space near downtown Atlanta,"While staying in downtown Atlanta for a convention, we choose to visit the Atlanta Botanical Garden. We spent about 4 hours touring the garden, including lunch at one of the restaurants there, and greatly enjoyed our time there.  They had special exhibit of plant based sculptures at the time, which will be there until Oct 27, 2019. They also have a wonderful permanent orchid display. We highly recommend this, even on a hot summer day, as there is a lot of shade. We purchased lunch from the Long Leaf restaurant deli counter, but sit down restaurant with wait staff available. We used the Marta transit system (combination of underground and bus) to go there."
Cocktails in the Garden,Must see. I love when the gardens are lit up at night. I unfortunately lost most of the photos from this trip (thanks to an iPhone update 😬) but I will be sure to take more.
The Atlanta Botanical Garden a Great place to take your parents!,Parking and the admission desk is close by and the botanical garden is wonderful.  You can walk with your loved ones and really enjoy everything the garden has to offer.  Can be difficult for the elderly on hot days. Plan to return when the temperature is a bit cooler.
Great day and value ,"The Atlanta botanical garden is one of the best values as is beautiful to visit. There were 4 of us that visited and as we approached we were asked if we were local or not. As 2 of us were, the cashier explained how we would not only save money over paying for individual tickets, but how 2 of us could become members to come back over and over again. It was a no-brainer! The gardens are superbly kept and there are places to get away from the hotlanta sun when needed."
Very nice garden,"I’m not really interested in plants and flowers, but the Alice in Wonderland garden took my attention. This is a nice garden, even just to walk through and see the flowers, walk through the trees on the sky bridge, see the orchids inside etc. I was greeted by everyone who worked there. Very nice on a hot summer’s morning. I walked from midtown 10th street| peachtree to the garden and came back by bus, which stops at the entrance"
Magical place to be around christmas,"the lightning experience in Christmas is fantastic. I when on night shift to see the christmas lights show and it was amazing. Great experience for locals and visitors, a must do if visiting during the holidays"
Imaginary Worlds,"When I went to the Botanical Garden a couple of days ago I found myself in ""ALICE'S WONDERLAND"" (I guess the themes are changing several times a year). Entry fee was $21.95 and I think I got ""value for money"". There is so much to see and to enjoy, I even learned a bit about native plants, had a good chat with lovely garden members working at the ""Edible Garden"", enjoyed the amazing work of arts like the Earth Goddess, the Camels and so on and loved to see so many children enjoying themselves in the ""Children's Garden"" where they had play groups, a water-area and several other activities. The Garden is very well designed with open spaces, hidden gardens like the ""Japanes Garden"" where some artists foccused on their canvas or lovely walks in the shade of huge native trees. I had diner at the Longleaf Restaurant which was very delicious and not overprized. The Orchid Center was not what I expected, never mind, I am visiting Atlanta and not Singapure. The Botanical Garden is spectacular and you can spend there several hours without getting bored. Children will love it as well. Public transport is a good way to get there."
gorgeous,"One of the best Botanical Gardens we have been to. We stayed in the neighborhood and walked over. Bring water, a hat and sunscreen!!"
Wonderful Outdoor Attraction,Go for great walk amongst beautiful trees and gardens. Attend the cooking show. Wrap up with the canopy walk.
Very romantic,Had a first date here and we really enjoyed ourselves!! It was relaxing and fun ! We even had dinner !
Beautiful!!!!!,What I like most about botanical garden is that it’s open all 4 seasons of the year. You can go there and enjoy the garden for that season always different.
Alices Wonderland ,"This is a summer must do for us every year. That being said, Alice was the worst part of this exhibit. So much could’ve been made of her, given the talent and creativity of the garden artists. We love the garden. It’s still five stars."
Beautiful sculptures,"Although it was extremely hot the day we went, we really enjoyed the gardens.  The sculptures were amazing."
A great place to visit,Stunning gardens - the displays are magnificent. Fantastic modern glass sculptures also. There is a shop & a restaurant. Children love the current display of Alice in Wonderland.
Beautiful gardens,"We were in Atlanta for Dragon Con and decided to take a side trip to the gardens because we heard about the Alice in Wonderland botanical sculptures and we were not disappointed.  We couldn't make it to the evening cocktail event on Thursday when costumes were welcome, so we went on Sunday just to check it out.  Admission is pricey but I used a AAA discount which helped slightly.  The grounds are gorgeous -- not just the sculptural pieces.  Wish we'd had more time to spend there to really take our time.  The restaurant on site is excellent."
Beautiful Gardens!,Went to the gardens with my family and really enjoyed it. The Alice in Wonderland exhibit was beautiful. Nice place for kids of all ages.
Very Beautiful place,"Took us about 2 hours to walk around. Very beautiful with some of the sculptures jaw dropping. Lots of time, effort & care given to the whole place. It was a very warm day but a lot of shade from the trees helped make it a comfortable walk. It’s a very tranquil place to visit. I’d highly recommend a visit. Thought it was reasonably priced to get in but food & drink to buy was over priced. Then we had to pay for parking as well."
Beautiful!,"We were very impressed! So enjoyed all the flower statues and the Alice in Wonderland display was amazing! So much to see, really worth the admission. Such a peaceful setting in a busy city. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. One negative, we tried to access the gardens from Piedmont Park and there are no more signs when you get to end of park. You have to go left and its just right down the road a short ways. We were first time visitors and we didn't know how to get to the entrance. A sign at the turn would have been extremely helpful."
Not a nature person but I liked it,The large plants in the shape of Mother Earth or the White Rabbit from Alice and Wonderland were really well done. Loved the bridge over the wooded area
Magical ,Words can’t describe what a beautiful place this is. As soon as I landed I went to explore this amazing gardens. Everything is colorful and fragrant. There are so many nooks and crannies to see. It’s a great place for all ages. I suggest you bring some water and wear comfortable walking shoes. Also make sure to keep your parking ticket. They charged me $15 because I couldn’t find it when I left.
Always a great place to visit,"Love, love, love this place. Became a member as soon as I moved here. Great place to visit all year round and bring the family. Spectacular shrub topiaries, great holiday light show, great concerts on the lawn, nice gift shop and a great little restaurant.                     William Carty"
Magical Escape,"The Garden is a real gem of Atlanta places to take visitors.  Its exhibitions/exhibits change often enough thatit is always current. It can be seen in the daylight for one view and a night for another adventure.  Each is a different experience. I have gone with just one other and I have taken a group of 20....each experience was fun,interesting and yes magical. I am taking a group of senior women next week."
Hanging out with my Grand babies,"Beautiful Garden with lots of interesting plants to see.  We loved all of the carving of different animals and characters.  there is also arts and crafts, restaurants and a few play areas for the kids.  Be sure to bring a stroller for small children, comfortable walking shoes and bottled water.  you cannot bring food inside."
A definite must see! ,"Beautiful facility, gardens and structures!! The details in the Alice in wonderland structures were amazing! Nice restaurant to grab a coffee or a bit to eat. Easy access for all ages."
Beautiful and fun ,"This was such a fun and beautiful part of a small Atlanta get away. Fun for solo, couples or a large group!"
Nature Lovers Paradise,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A Must see for anyone who values and appreciates nature and living art. Atlanta Botanical Garden is Eye catching and has dozens of mesmerizing sculptures and colorful themes that everyone can appreciate. Definitely worth the price of admission and a great memory to share with friends, family or even by yourself. Peacefully therapeutic and relaxing environment throughout with a friendly and helpful staff. The restaurant was pretty good as well if you want to cool off and get a bite to eat. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ❤️"
Beautiful way to get some fresh air in midtown ,"We came to midtown Atlanta for the weekend, and ended up coming here. It is a really beautiful place with lots of different botanical spaces and works of art. Also ended up in the restaurant, which was a nice delicious surprise."
Amazing!,The gardens where like no other I have  seen. Special exhibit of Alice and Wonderland was so nice. The trees and flowers are a nice change from the city lie of Atlanta. Lots of shade which made it so nice with the heat.
Very pleasant day out,Not a lot for tourists to do in atlanta but the botanical garden is worth a visit. Could do with a bigger choice of snack places in the venue but overall a good day out
Good adult family attraction,Took our teenage daughters to experience the Alice in Wonderland sculpt and we were pleasantly pleased. Hats off to the associates that put in the time to create these works of art. My wife was impressed by the hanging orchids. It is about a 60 to 90 minute tour to see the gardens. I feel that the admittance price was high in comparison to what is offered to the visitor.
We love it here!,"We took our daughter here for their holiday lights and had the best time!  The exhibits were breathtaking, the atmosphere was perfect. One highlight was the model train section that just about every kid there loved. There was so much to see and do and even the perfect spots to sit and just observe everything. The s’mores section was a huge hit for us too!"
Beautiful landscape ,"The botanical gardens are a beautiful addition to your visit to Atlanta. There is no scenery quite as pretty in all of Atlanta and the gardens are well maintained. I would go in the afternoon because nothing seems attended to in the morning hours, and there was no one working the few out door stands at all. Also one might think about going in the cooler times of the year because it is miserable hot in late summer no matter where you are in the gardens. We spent every moment near water features just dipping our hands and cloths in the cool water to cool off. They should consider installing misters like Disney parks use to refresh their customers throughout. The new Alice in wonderland plant sculptures were cute but not huge. Many of the other sculptures were much better, like the Phoenix and the dog and dragon. The orchid exhibit was very well done and many are within sniffing reach which was a plus. Look for the chocolate scented orchids. They are incredible and the kids will get a blast smelling them. Though it is very pricey to go to the botanical gardens here in Atlanta, it’s still nice to see them. You forget where you are for sure, for a while."
Add this to your itinerary ,"Even in the blistering heat, this was a highlight of my Atlanta sightseeing. The canopy walk through the forested area was several degrees cooler on a mid-summer day. There’s a nice little restaurant and cafe as well. The gardens are impressively well maintained and the exhibits are artful. Definitely a gem and worth the price of admission."
Fun place to go for a piece of nature,"Went in early August with my husband and two early 20s daughters.    It was lovely.   SO many beautiful flowers to see - many unlike some of what we have in Minnesota.    I loved the couple of Chiuly art pieces in the gardens.    I won't deny it was hot out but water was easy to find, people were friendly and the canopy walk was shady and relatively cool.    I really liked that it was a fairly small garden so a few hours allowed us to get a great view of this attraction and still be able to cover other things in Atlanta when only in town a few days.  If I came back to Atlanta I would love to see one of their nighttime attractions."
Thursday night Alice exhibot,"So we came in a Thursday night to  capture some photos of the Alice in Wonderland exhibit. There is one problem with this exhibit, the lighting. Let me clarify this issue, the lights shining on these sculptures were installed when the sculptures were built. Problem is that the plants abound these lights have grown, thus blocking these lights. Some of the sculptures had not lights. I hope someone working for the garden take a night time tour to investigate my critique, so others can enjoy this exhibit the way it was meant to be enjoyed."
Wonderful place for everyone,"This place is amazing everything is well groomed, there's lots of thing for both young and old.Parking fills up pretty quickly so come early.The paths are concrete and all are handicapped accessible making it a perfect place for everyone.There's shaded areas for sitting and indoor exhibits from the rain forest to the desert.If your in Atlanta make time to visit it's worth it."
Something for everyone.. beautiful !,So I am eating breakfast at our hotel and a mother of teenage girls had rented a room for a daughters Birthday Party... have you been to the Botanical Gardens?  Zoo? or Aquarium?   A native Atlanta person...hello  what is up??  Local folks visit your city landmarks.  Expand your children's intelligence and curiosity !!
Beautiful gardens and fun kid area.,It was quite hot when we went and my younger children were less than thrilled.  But they loved building at the children's garden and cooling off in the splash area. Beautiful area and impressive botanical sculptures and pool.  My 15-year-old and I found it very tranquil.  A bit pricey but fun to see.
Fabulous gardens. Captivating for all ages,I went with low expectations but a friend said this is her favorite place in Atlanta. OMG. This place is amazing!!! Must see. At every turn there are dramatic plants displayed as an art form. So enjoyable- even in the heat.
Atlanta’s Garden of Eden,"Breathtakingly beautiful, during all seasons, the garden is an oasis in the middle of the South’s largest city. Wonderful concerts. Magical decorations and lights. And, of course, the amazing plants and flowers.  Located next to Piedmont Park in midtown, the location is central. You’re only ten minutes from downtown and ten minutes from Buckhead. My favorite time to visit is during the Christmas season."
Beautiful gardens.,We enjoyed our 3 hour visit here.  The motorized scooter was a big help to one of us and every bit worth the $25 rental fee.  The aAlice in Wonderland theme was incredibly sculpted out of various plants.  You would have to see it to believe it!  Such talent.  The orchid house was tremendous.  Highly recommend.
Great displays,We had a lovely afternoon walking through the park and then enjoyed the displays at the Botanical Garden.  It cost $21.95 per adult admission.
Amazing place,It’s so beautiful and musically made green rain lights from the trees. You have to see the night light up show and enjoy the beautiful greenery.
Enchanted Evening,"We went in the evening right before sun down which was great to view the installations and get amazing pictures. We had some decent wine while touring and after sun down we headed for dinner and sat outside. It was a wonderful evening, we spent a total of 3.5 hours. The food was really good and the service was excellent. It was a warm and humid night but you didn't notice because it was such a lovely evening."
A Beautiful and Relaxing Botanical Garden!,"Took some friends to tour the gardens to enjoy the plants, the sculptures and just a very relaxing place to stroll or just to sit and talk. It is always a great place to visit."
Spent all day here.,"$21.95 to spend a whole Sunday here . it was wonderful and well worth every cent.The tea rooms were good as well , nice and cheap."
ALWAYS a delight!,ABG is a midtown ATL gem...wonderful any time of year and any occasion.  The exhibits are always changing and the plants and flowers are gorgeous.
Alice in wonderland,"Parking was cheep 5.00 per car load, Tickets were 21.95 dollars each. Exhibitions for Alice in Wonder land were too few. Although there was a great dragon to look at, and three camels? which I did not read about in Alice in wonderland. We went on the cocktail night it was 90 F 12.00 dollar mixed drinks in a 8 oz glass filled with ice before the liquor was poured. 7.00 beers. For the two of us we went into the only air-conditioned restaurant which had maybe 25% of the tables full and was informed there was no place to seat us. Because all the tables were full (all reserved ). So in the same area we bought some poor ham sandwiches and drinks and a sweet. For the two of us cost 30.00+  (I've had better meals in the school cafeteria), and we ate in the area that were told we could not.  I have been to golf courses that have had fans blowing on greens to circulate the air, the Atlanta botanical Garden obvisely has not heard or seen this or even considered this even in there outdoor eating areas. The place is wired for there xmas show wires are run all over the place. COME ON plug in a fan. I do realize they need to make profit some where but being reamed as a customer. I will not be back."
I just love this place..,We have been members to the Atlanta Botanical Garden for the past six years.. it is one of my 3 favorite things in Atlanta.. just love the Alice in Wonderland exhibit... so worth a visit.
Beautiful!,"Attended a work event here. Some very cool sculptures, and love the Alice in Wonderland displays - so detailed!"
Just keeps getting better and better,"This is a wonderful place to enjoy nature (and the beauty of the South) at your own pace.  The gardens are varied and interesting and the views of the city from the gardens are quite beautiful.  Many volunteers from the city come each day to tend the gardens.  They have amazing shows that vary with the seasons.  Even the restaurants are good.One note of caution, go on a cool day.  The Botanical Gardens can be a tough place to visit on a hot day.  It seems as though the gardens are several degrees warmer than the city as a whole."
Absolutely beautiful!,"What a beautiful garden!  We went when they had the Alice In Wonderland theme and the sculptures were amazing.  The Earth Goddess was my favorite and is a permanent exhibit.  The orchid house had some species I had never seen before and was just fantastic.  If you are in the area, you definitely have to visit.  We went in the morning when they first opened so it wasn't as crowded or as hot and humid outside.  Definitely worth a stop!"
Beauty and natural facinations,One of the nicest places to visit on a cool day. The plants and colors are glorious. The orchid house is delightful. A natural beauty if the big Peach city.
Visit to the US,An experience worth the money spent. Could be once in a lifetime experience. Early morning is the best time
Beautiful,"A beautiful afternoon and some amazing living sculptures. This is the kind of place you can come to year after year and see new things and some old favorites. Walking through the gardens is peaceful and helps you feel more connected to Nature. The skybridge was one of our favorites and gives a wonderful aerial view of the goddess. Another of our favorites was the Orchid room where the orchids are suspended in air, grown hydroponically. My very hyperactive 8 year old boy did'nt enjoy it as much my 13 year old daughter and I did which did effect our enjoyment. So I recommend leaving the rambunctious young ones at home. We ate at The Leaf restaurant and it was awesome! Many of the ingredients they use are grown there at the Botanical Gardens. Price was pretty reasonable. Only took a few hours to get the full tour. Definitely a great place to go outside the normal tourist attractions."
Thousands of twinkly light glow at dusk,"Public transportation was easy and low cost.  Dinner at the on-site restaurant was exceptional.  And then the light began glowing.  Thousands of tiny lights rolling color changes in trees, shrubs, and waves upon the ground.  A visual extravaganza with subtle sound effects.  Quiet conversations everywhere did not distract from the ever changing colors and patterns.  We even saw a young man propose to his sweetheart.  We all cheered and applauded."
Amazing oasis close to downtown Atlanta,"Something for everyone here - Alice in Wonderland topiary for the kids, tropical jungle environment, extensive orchid display and much much more. Ages six to seventy had a great time!"
Annual Christmas Light Visit,If you are in Atlanta during the holiday season ...you must go to the botanical gardens for the Christmas lights. It is by far the best holiday event (better than even NY tree lighting). It can get crowded  but there are so many things to see ...you can find a serene spot. It is a great activity for all in the family. We have been going now for 4/5 years.
Beautiful Beyond Belief !!!,"This was my first ever visit to the gardens and I hope it won't be my last. It is a beautiful eye opening experience for all. The variety of plant life and the ""magical imaginary world exhibit"" is worth it. Don't miss out make it a priority."
Very beautiful,Atlanta botanical garden is one of the best I have seen. Its very beautifully made and maintained too. It will take around 3-4 hours at a leisure speed to visit everything. The food options are not many. The tickets are a little pricey as per my opinion. The gift shop is very small. There is ample parking space and since it is connected to Piedmont park it is great since the park is free to visit and there is a nice splash pad with a scenic walking path and a city view too.
Impressive and Beautiful,"One of our party had been to Atlanta many times before, but had never visited the gardens. It turns out that they were a frequently overlooked gem! The gardens are very nicely laid out, easily accessible on well-made paths, and the displays are stunning, especially the current Alice in Wonderland exhibit."
Alice in a Wonderland of Flowers,"Rush ... don’t wait...to see the wonderful exhibit of Alice in Wonderland topiary characters at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. With gracious reciprocity for my NYBG membership the entrance was free, but otherwise $25 and well worth it. Lovely winding paths, interesting suspended bridge trail, and orchids delight."
"We drove 8 hours from Tampa and were not able to enter, we called and they didn't inform us about earlier due to concert","We drove 8 hours from Tampa and were not able to enter, when we called they didn't inform us they will close earlier due to a concert. They denied the access to the restrooms to our daughters and were very aggressive!!"
Two visits in 5 days!,Loved the gardens! The Alice in Wonderland exhibit is great. We love the gardens and enjoyed our visit!!
Best part of Atlanta ,This has been my favorite part of my trip so far-hands down! The gardens are simply to die for and I loved all of the Alice in Wonderland topiaries. If I lived here I would be spending every single free second I had wandering through the gardens.
Fun despite rain,Went on a Thursday and they were setting up the Cocktails in the Garden. Just as we were starting the bottom fell out fell. Fortunately there are several large greenhouses that were safe from the thunderstorm and there was lots to see in tnem as well. The works of art scattered about the garden were beautiful.
Fun outdoor outing ,"Beautiful park with themed shrubbery. Nice walking path and nicely shaded. A little expensive, pay to park and about $20 per adult. But would recommend."
Unbelievable lights!,"The Botanical Garden from late November to January is Spectacular!! Every year they put up Christmas lights up and it looks amazing! Highly recommend coming if you are in town!! There is so much to see, you’ll be there for hours! The have bars for drinks and also serve hot chocolate."
Beautiful!!,My adult daughter and I visited this beautiful garden. They have AAA discount so show your card at ticked booth to receive it. We went early - right when they opened and parking was also close. You pay to park but there is a cover garage which is nice. Staff was quite helpful. Grounds are handicap accessible- with wide paths to make wheelchairs easy to maneuver. The orchid building is something you should not miss. The Alice in wonderful sculptures are fantastic.
A feast of colors and textures for all ages to enjoy,"The paths are all handicap friendly and there are lots of benches and shade trees. The orchid house was huge but the doors and pathways inside are not handicap friendly. There is a restaurant. The snack bar was not open. 30 acres of awesome feasting of our eyes on color combinations and textures! We especially liked all the sculptures such as 3 camels, the earth godess, the cheshire cat, the dragon and pegasus to name just a few. Was it a good value for our money? YES. And it is family friendly, I would rate it a B for handicap folks. Not a B+. Is this a place I would come a 2nd time? I am not sure if I would but I am so glad we made the effort to come one time. There are concerts or other programs in the evenings and if we lived in the area, it might be a good place to join as a member and come often."
Wonderful experience at the Atlanta Botanical Garden.,"This place is beautiful.  My daughter and I had a wonderful 1/2 day exploring the grounds and marveling at the plant sculptures.  We walked, talked and laughed ~ it was delightful.  They do have a cafe on site, which we didn't get to try but next time we plan to have our meal there."
Beautiful,My family and I were in awe with the beauty of the gardens. The weather was nice and the staff were great. I highly recommend this place if you are vacationing in the Atlanta area.
Worth every penny,My daughter and I visited Atlanta and had purchased a CityPass which did not include the botanical garden but I read the reviews and decided to add it to my list.  I am so glad to have paid the extra money.  It was worth every penny.  The living sculptures were amazing and we got to meet the gardner/artist who was giving the mermaid a haircut.  He kindly explained the process of designing and planting them which only added a dimension to the visit.  The 30 acre garden winds around and it feels much bigger than it is.  There are plenty of shaded walkways and the July heat wasn't bad--I would recommend an early morning visit in the summer time.  This was the highlight of my Atlanta visit!
Beautiful!,"While I did visit during the winter months, there was absolutely no lack of color and awe.  There is a canopy walk and multiple fountains, glass work, and unique gardens to visit.  I happened to visit on a weekend when the Orchid festival was happening and got to view some amazing orchids.  There are greenhouses with multiple types of experiences in each one.  I highly recommend this attraction!"
Amazing,"We loved the Botanical Garden with its great plant varieties, its nice paths and the lovely flower art."
I loved it all!!,"This was a beautiful botanical garden, enhanced by the incredible sculptures made out of plants. There was plenty of parking and a nice gift shop."
Ahhh-MAzing Topiaries you will not find anywhere else!!!,"These are not the typical hedge transformed into a topiary.  Earth Goddess is made up of 4,000 plants that give color and texture to her hair and facial expression to her face.  She has a waterfall flowing in her hands! There's a fire breathing dragon with simulated fire that is reflected as red lights on the ground, next to it is a sleeping princess.  The camels, pegasus, dog and this years Alice in Wonderland theme with the white rabbit, all are incredible topiaries made out of living colorful plants.  There is also a GREAT childrens garden where they can play in fountains, walk on a snake in the grass, walk under waterfalls as well as the usual climb and slide structures.The edible garden also has a kitchen with chef demonstrations.  The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is one of the best in the country!On Thursday nights they have lights displayed.Parking at times can get tight.  There is an onsite parking lot but it fills up quickly.It is WELL worth the entry fee."
"Relaxing, wonderful, lazy day in the woods, Chasing Alice in Wonderland","It's been years since we visited, and were glad we came back.  A bit confusing getting from the underground parking to the main level, not clearly marked in the elevators, so get your bearings before entering.  Once above ground, and through the entrance hall, we mapped our course and headed down the trail.  While the outside temps were in the 80's it was cool underneath the forest canopy, allowing us to wander, admire, and learn to our hearts content.  We took the forest path first, then through the childrens gardens, then sought out the many floral sculptunes (mosaiculture).  Bring your camera: the Mad Hatter, White Rabbit and Phoenix were splendid, all part of the Imaginary Worlds: Alice's Wonderland exhibit now through October 27, 2019.  We cooled off in the high altitude greenhouse (cooled to 12,000 feet MSL), before exiting through the Kitchen Garden of edibles.  A great day for us all."
So beautiful,This was one of the places my son chose to visit for his birthday weekend. About halfway through the park I told him that I'm glad he chose it.  It is so beautiful.  I loved finding all the little tucked away places like little secret gardens. All the amazing flowers that I had never seen before. This place is magical.
Wonderful Fun for Kids on Tuesdays,I am a member here and often take others to enjoy this beautiful city space.  This time I took the grandchildren to see the Alice and Wonderland Plant Giants.  They also enjoyed the special children's area.  They have great ideas for art projects to go along with what is going on in the garden.  They love the play area and the splash pad.  It wasn't working this day but they had plenty of sprinklers to keep the kids cooled off.
Tremendous Space & Location,"Terrific In-Town destination.  Great walking trail, incredible plants and flowers and almost always a fun exhibit or display on-hand.  Very grown-up place but the very little ones will have fun running around."
Wow! Beautiful!,"The Atlanta Botanical Garden was one of my favorite things to do in Atlanta. It looks huge on the map but it's really not. It's big but just right. I loved the incorporation of Chihuly glass art and the themed topiaries. Great water features, the bridge in the forested area was excellent and the Orchid Center was amazing. What a great variety.  Loved this also because it's spread out enough that you don't feel the crowds.  I would definitely visit here again.  I've heard that around Christmas, they put up thousands of lights.  That would be amazing to see.  I highly recommend this attraction!"
A GEM!!,"I wish we had had more time to tour around this well maintained and beautiful garden.  I would have liked to try the restaurant.  The flow of the gardens works well and the current topiary show is nothing short of breathtaking.  The stucture themselves are amazing and the detailed plantings and weekly maintainance to keep them looking good is perfect.   The entrance fee is a bit pricey, but if you stay all day a bargain."
So Beautiful,This place is stunning. They have multiple different themes throughout the year and all are beautiful. It is cool to go after dark when everything is lit up as well. There is a restaurant located in the middle of the gardens if you decide to make an entire date night out of it.
My kids loved it!!,"We have been wanting to visit the garden for months now, so we decided to spend the day. We will definitely go back! It was well worth the price of admission. My only reproach is the fact that parking is not included. Granted it was just $6 for us, but I think it would be nice to include as part of the ticket to visit this wonderful garden."
Wonderful wandering!,Visiting the gardens exceeded my expectations. The topiaries were amazing - unlike any I had ever seen - and the orchid exhibit was fabulous. Lunch at the restaurant was a delightful break. It was relaxing to explore the well-maintained grounds.
"Neat exhibits, topiaries, and Orchid Conservatory","Tons of trails to explore the grounds, plenty of flora to explore and photograph, orchid conservatory was full of cool orchids. The planted features hadn't been planted yet since it was April, but I'm sure they would've been neat, some educational areas also present for gardening info and edible plants. Could breeze through the place, or spend an entire day exploring the various areas, features, and garden types."
Beautiful place to spend a morning,"This is the best botanical garden I have ever been to and I've see several now.  The only other one that comes close is St. Louis, but ATL beats it out by a narrow margin.  The plant mosaic sculptures really set it apart from other gardens.  Lots of variety of plants and trees to see.  Everything is arranged beautifully and the walking paths are nice and easy to follow.  Everything is perfectly maintained.  Admission is pretty steep, but once you see it you will agree that it was worth it.  If you live close by, I'd recommend a membership just to have a nice place to take a walk.  I'd also recommend seeing it in the morning if visiting in the summer because the heat becomes a factor fairly quickly.  Wear comfy shoes too because there's a lot of walking.  My phone said we walked about 2.7 miles and we didn't go into the woods part of it because it was getting too hot."
Enchanted experience,"Hands down, the most beautiful garden I have ever toured....peaceful, well maintained, every staff member we encountered was lovely, smiling, geniunely happy to be there.It was a splendid experience....so many varietes of...., the topiaries..the edible garden...ahhhWell worth the calories burned from walking (tip-wear comfortable shoes).Lots to see, lots of learning.....plan at least 3 to 4 hours."
Fantastic nature bound escape within the city!,"(This is a late review, there is no selection option for previous year so I had selected January 2019 but we visited in Jauary 2018.)What a wonderful meditating place! Once you are in the garden you will loose track of time and yourself, I mean it. The visit was kind of a birthday gift to my daughter. We visited the gardens in late January 2018. It was not even the start of the season and they were working on Mother Earth Sculpture. The orchids were amazing, so was the tropical garden."
One of my favorite places in Atlanta,"The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a magical place to visit. I attend as often as possible. It does get crowded during holidays and special events, so you will have to plan ahead and allow extra time."
Modest size bur high quality gardens.,"This botanical garden is hampered by limited space compared to some other gardens, but makes effective use of that space.  Best known for its orchid collection, it has plenty of other worthwhile areas both within the conservatories and outside."
A nice escape from the city ,"I enjoyed the gardens. They were much less crowded than other Atlanta attractions on a summer weekday. While some of the indoor exhibits were crowded, the rest of the grounds are big enough that you’re not on top of everyone else."
Amazing Trip ! Amazing Fun !,"I thoroughly enjoyed exploring Up the botanical gardens in Atlanta. THE Expedition was Just Great ! Lots of beautiful plants, flowers and art Installations to see. The Botanical Garden is beautiful all year round. This year is a special exhibit with Alice's Wonderland. Take a relaxing stroll through the gardens and definitely visit the Orchid House! Highly recommend. The Alice in Wonderland giant topiary’s were amazing. One of them was over 25’ tall and everything was so colorful. We spent four hours wandering the trails, visiting the gardens and hot houses. The Atlanta Botanical Garden was filled with beautiful foliage. The outdoor exhibits had mythical animals decorated with plants. The greenhouse had an array of tropical plants. There are surprises of beauty around every corner. Make sure you see the short film before beginning your tour. Currently there is an Alice in Wonderland exhibition with is fantastic ! The sculptures are utterly beautiful ! The hot houses are amazing, particularly the orchid house. Then there is the forest walk and canopy walk. All enlightening. The Chihully sculptures are a surprising addition. We went in the morning when it first opened and it was not crowded, however as we left in the afternoon there was quite a line of cars waiting to get in.  There is a nice cafe to get snacks and lunch.  Enjoy, but bring your hat, shade and water. There are water stations throughout to fill up.  Paths are easy for strollers and wheelchairs."
Beautiful,"An amazing variety of flowers! Take the time to walk through all of the pathways and corridors so you dont miss anything.On a side note, be prepared for the heat during the summer and stay hydrated."
The Most Amazing Gardens,"No matter what time you go, there is always something new at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens. Whether it’s Imaginary Worlds, the Garden Lights, Chevalier, Christmas Trains, or the Orchid House, it never ceases to amaze me. Plants, trees, fountains, and beautiful flowers (is that a surprise?) cover all the property of the gardens. A huge exciting children’s garden with a playground, outdoor theater, obstacle courses, and sprinklers make it the ideal place for little kids. The delicious restaurant is perfect for when you have an appetite after all the walking you’ll do. A huge “greenhouse” with the jungle and desert plants is definitely a plus if your to hot, or even if you are way too cold. A gigantic skywalk gives you amazing views of what lies below and the treetops, while the Fountain of Gaia is an excellent place for lily pads. The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is an awesome, mystical, crowd-pleasing place for everyone."
Beautiful Gardens,This is a must see.  Not too crowded with absolutely beautiful gardens.  The sculptures are amazing.  There is plenty of shade when walking through as well.
Amazing!,Amazing flowers turned into awesome works of art. We were there for the beautiful Alice in Wonderland display.
Beautiful displays all around,They do a fantastic job with all of the different areas in the gardens here. I thought it may be a bit too boring for my niece and nephews I took here but they really seemed to enjoy it.
A GEM,"Put this on your must visit list.Plan on at least 3-4 hours. The garden is beautifully laid out. The walkways are wide and well maintained. It is mostly wheelchair accessible though there are areas with steps or non-paved surfaces that might be a struggle.There are plenty of places to sit, many in shaded areas. There also restrooms conveniently located along with water fountains. Though the water pressure was a little lacking, many of these were also water bottle fill stations.I ate at the Quick Cafe which is INSIDE the Longleaf Restaurant. Probably the one thing not made clear on their garden map, nor is there great signage outside directing you to the direct entrance to the cafe. The food was fresh and priced reasonably."
Alice in Wonderland is Amazing!,A local friend took me to the botanical gardens to the Alice in Wonderland themed exhibit. It was a gorgeous journey through various parts of the gardens. Each topiary was hand crafted and enormous. Great photo opportunities!
My First Visit,"Spectacular displays.  I was elated to finally visit this beautiful space.  I am amazed at the artistry, and the great detail which goes into each display.  It's beautiful and magical, all in one.  The Alice and Wonderland display is priceless.  I can't wait to go back around the holidays. I hear the lights are amazing."
Wonderful day in the gardens,"I was in town visiting my Uncle and he had been wanting to take me for a while. He, myself and my husband got up on Sunday morning and had a wonderful garden experience. The special displays were gorgeous but what I most enjoyed were the many flowers and plants. With every turn, there was more to enjoy. I may go back during Christmas!"
A really amazing place,After several visits we remained amazed at the quaility and diversity of this garden. The orchid pavilion is extraordinary and the current exhibition (Alicein wonderland) worth the trip this summer.
Atlanta's Gem,"The Botanical Gardens are just beautiful, year round.  The seasonal exhibits are beautiful, the Orchid Daze Show, the current Alice in Wonderland exhibit, the Christmas Lights.  All the topiaries are amazing.  The concerts during the summer are great.  It's well worth the membership fee!!"
Alice’s Wonderland! ,"Such a lovely place! The Alice's Wonderland theme right now is just fantastic. I was in awe at some of the plant sculptures. People of all ages will enjoy it. Just make sure you go a bit early or a bit later during the summer because it'll get really really really hot in the middle of the day. Drink lots of water, reapply sunscreen, bring a hat."
My first Botanical Gardens,"I love flowers and gardens of any kind.  This place is beautiful.  I don’t know if all Botanical Gardens are this unique, but they set the bar pretty high if I go to another one.  The Alice in Wonderland theme, fits so perfectly within the garden.  There is something mesmerizing at every turn.  Give yourself plenty of time, at least 2 hours to enjoy all there is to see and don’t forget the gift shop."
Amazing and beautiful garden,"This was a highlight of a few days in Atlanta for meetings.  A local colleague recommended going there Saturday after the meetings were over and we were very glad we did.  Amazing ""mosaiculture"" of beautifully crafted designs spread throughout the garden.  Lovely orchid house, complete with amazing little frogs inside ""aquariums"".  Lovely dining option (casual) allows a respite from seeing so much beauty!  This is a MUST for visitors to Atlanta!"
Beautiful!!,We took the bus there but we kind of wished we just drove cause it was a long walk back to the bus but the gardens were beautiful.  A must see if your visiting Atlanta and want to relaxing afternoon.  I have a teenager and a toddler and everyone was happy here!
Expensive but beautiful,"It's a hefty price to enter, but the gardens are beautiful.  So many different kinds of plants.  Fun to walk around."
Awesome ,Pretty nice botanical garden. We loved the Alice in Wonderland decorations. We would definitely go back.
Alice in Atlanta,"I took my employees for a group trip to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens for the day.  We got the group rate but no tour guide went along with us.  That was just fine as we did the tour by ourselves at our own pace.  The new Alice in Wonderland exhibit was wonderfully great.  As someone who owns a garden center, my staff and I truly appreciated the detail and hard work it took to create such beautiful living sculptures.  The conservatory was it's usual wonder but I would like to see it change a bit every once in a while.  I love Japanese gardens and this is not the place to enjoy one.  The grounds were in great shape and everyone had a great time.  We spent 3 hours before we got hungry.  Go check out the new Alice exhibit."
Outstanding,The Atlanta Botanical Garden was filled with beautiful foliage. The outdoor exhibits had mythical animals decorated with plants. The greenhouse had an array of tropical plants. This garden is worth the visit!!!
Nice place to spend time,Well organized with thousands of varieties from around the world.  Comfortable resting spots and cheap parking.  Located in Piedmont Park
Great place for a wedding,"You could not find a better place to have a June wedding. The seating for the guests in the rose garden was in a pool of shade by evening, perfect when it's summer! And all of the magnificent plantings and sculptural creations made a great backdrop to the events. The indoor reception was gorgeous, too, and the staff serving the dinner meal courteous and caring. A stellar event!"
Alice's Wonderland,The Botanical Garden is beautiful all year round. This year is a special exhibit with Alice's Wonderland. Take a relaxing stroll through the gardens and definitely visit the Orchid House! Highly recommend.
EXCELLENT!,The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is an everchanging adventure.  One of my favorite places in Atlanta to hang out.  Eveyone that works there is so courteous and helpful.  It is an easy stroll of pure enjoyment.
Beautiful place!!,The Atlanta Botanical Garden is very good place. The figures made with plants and flowers are amazing and beautiful. We enjoy the park; is relaxing and you can walk around the plants and trees.
Fathers Day Trip,Amazing place with awesome themed gardens! Very inspirational and calming place to stroll through and get gardening ideas!

Definitely worth the admission price!,"I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the botanical gardens in ATL. Lots of beautiful plants, flowers and art installations to see. The Alice in Wonderland giant topiary’s were amazing. One of them was over 25’ tall and everything was so colorful. I saw everything from a Cheshire Cat to a mermaid, dragon, Pegasus, earth goddess, mammoth ... and the list goes on. Also got to enjoy a couple of Chihuly pieces. I spent about two hours there and covered the grounds at a leisure pace. Lots of cool things to take pictures of, I highly recommend spending some time at the botanical gardens. Make sure you grab a map when you get there so you don’t miss anything."
Gorgeous gardens,Beautiful gardens with an Alice in Wonderland theme of flower sculptures from the book. Nice cafe to take a break in and beautiful tropical inside gardens. Canopy walk through part of the gardens!
