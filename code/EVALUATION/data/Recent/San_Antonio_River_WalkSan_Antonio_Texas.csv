River and a walk,Parked at the mall garage and stated walking. Restaurants galore. Some very pricey. We had lunch at Salt creek. Than took a 30 min. boat ride. Weather was warm but it was a really nice afternoon.
Pretty cool but be wary,"This is pretty much a very long walking mall with a river next to it. Yes, it was history and you can ride the barge down the river, but let's call it what it is. However, there are loads of restaurants to suit any appetite. Be wary if you take the sidewalk ""above"" the riverwalk as there is a pretty significant homeless population and many places are under construction."
Awesome,"We have always wanted to come here, now that we can’t travel internationally we decided to come.  It was not crowded, enjoyed the walking and some of the restaurants, a lot were closed, a whole lot were closed and I pray that it picks up for them.  Just imagining how they built it and what a feat that is.  We stayed on the Riverwalk and enjoyed it all."
Nice experience,This was our second time in this place. It was great and always clean. Make sure you walk in both sides to enjoy the difference between the vegetation and gardens
Beautiful area to walk around,"The River Walk is very beautiful, peaceful, and clean.  I will be happy when more businesses are open."
A San Antonio Must!,"If this is your first time here, start the experience with a boat tour. The tours last about 25 minutes and cost about $14. The River Walk is full of places to get drinks, dinner, and souvenirs. Great place to enjoy the weather and have dinner and drinks with friends and family at affordable prices!"
Always a fun time on River Walk,My friend and I visited San Antonio recently and thoroughly enjoyed walking up and down Riverwalk. We ate at several different restaurants and shopped at many of the shops and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. You can spend as little time there or as much time there as you want… And it’s a lot of fun to sit and people watch too.
Beautiful,"Everything you need for a great time in San Antonio can be found on the River Walk. Safe, clean and beautiful. the only issue is not everyone walking around wears a mask. We felt the need to have one on at all times."
Lots of homeless,"Even after covid a few places were open and quite a few people strolling around, however in a short period of half an hour that I walked, I encountered three homeless people shirtless asking for money. It was also so hot and muggy/humid. Too many homeless and junkies. Not one cop or security around on a Sunday night which is when I assume should have more security as it is crowded. There were also people in bicycles, the pathways are already narrow enough, I dont understand why those are allowed. Weird. It wasnt fun, the last thing I want to see in a vacation is homeless people asking for money."
Amazing City Center!The ,"The San Antonio River Walk in the downtown is just awesome. The integration of the river, hotels, restaurants and old world charm is spectacular. I have seen pictures but they don't compare to real life.We enjoyed dinner at a restaurant, walked the riverway and took a boat ride, Wow!Stay after dark and you can see the lights and nightlife, along with the bats that come out from under some bridges.We had breakfast the next morning on the river.What a jewel in San Antonio!"
Beautiful and Fun,"We took a quick trip down just to get away!! It was our first visit to San Antonio! The River Walk was bustling on a Saturday night!!! Music, restaurants,stores, even Live Mariachi bands!! WE had a great time!!"
Extrodinary,"I have traveled the world but have never seen anything quite like the River Walk in San Antonio.  Other cities have promenades or walks along riverbanks, but nothing quite like this. The Riverwalk is right in the downtown center of the city and has been so integrated into the cities ecosystem that buildings may have entrances on the street level but also below ground at the River Walk level.  The area is beautiful and because it has been around for so long the foliage is all very mature and beautiful.   There are multiple access points to the riverwalk giving folks multiple options when traversing the city."
Strolling along ,"I was walking along The Riverwalk and loved the waterfalls, the wildlife, the fragrant flowers and some cool artwork. Here is a glimpse of my walk."
Relaxing Expeience,"Loved learning the history of the area, plenty of places you didn't think the boat would fit, but it did. I would love to run the Riverwalk if I lived there, plenty of sights to see and interesting people watching."
NIce maze of waterway,Really loved walking along the river with all the restaurants and houses. It is a must see if you are in San Antonio. The tourist attraction built around it is unique.
Can be busy in some areas...,"Love to walk the river. Lots of restaurants, bars. Take a boat ride or just simply people watch. Can be crowded at certain times."
Loved this place!,"You would never know this manmade river was under downtown.  Lots of great restaurants, bars and cool places to sit and enjoy."
Great day on the river walk! Lots to do & see!,"The San Antonio Riverwalk is absolutely a beautiful must see. It's miles long, so wear good shoes! There's tons of picturesque spots. While visiting, you must take a ride on one of the tour boats (10pp). There are several resteraunts along the way too. Parking is available in multiple parking lots for about 5$ for 8 hours."
Calming ,"Loved the walk. In fact we stayed close to the walk at the Agave Apartment, 633 S St Mary’s St. We went for a soothing walk morning and evening. The boat ride looked interesting but not sure it’s worth it during these times of COVID. The line for it itself made us rush past that area, as we try to avoid crowds. Loved the natural waters with the ducks swimming around."
Do waste your money onriver boats line over 3 hours long ,The line for the river boats was over 3 hours long don’t waste your money they can only load them with so many people because of Covid avoid at all cost and they are only good for the day and no refunds.
Wonderful!  You don't want to miss it!,"The River Walk is a wonderful, scenic adventure in San Antonio with many terrific places to dine.  Everything from Tex Mex food to Bar be Que to steaks.  The ""Walk"" is a nice shady area to stroll along the San Antonio River in the heart of town"
Beautiful at night,"We visited 2 weeks ago, on a Saturday night. There was a peaceful BLM event we came upon with beautiful music, about 200 people, about half of whom were wearing masks, making it a risky business for them and anyone trying to participate or pass by."
Scenic for Nice Walks or Eating,Very scenic and the waterfall is beautiful. It’s also nice that all restaurants and attractions surround the area so you can reach everything using the mini bridges or staircases.
So  beautiful  a compliment to nature,"There are no words that can express the understated and natural beauty of the riverwalk. I would bring good walking shoes as the entire span of the walk is larger that Central Park in NYC, There are elevators along the route for physically challenged vistors however not too conspiciously  marked."
Great to walk,"This is a great walk for an hour to go on the complete route around the horseshoe.  We did it after taking the boat trip which allowed us to stop for more time at each place to see the buildings, restaurants and gardens."
Hot Day in San Antonio,Quick review to let you know it's still hot even down below street level and in the shade! Fortunately all the shops were looked into were fully aircondioned and offered a quick relief from the heat.
Post-Covid - lots of restaurants are not open,"Our post-covid trip was good.  There were very few people walking around the riverwalk and alot of the stores and restaurants were closed.  It appears that with the low volume of visitors, many only open for the weekend.  Very limited boat availability during this time."
COVID impact and the river walk,"Business's open appeared grateful and eager to serve everyone out and about the river walk area.  There were so few options it made the trip downtown very disappointing.  The streets were quiet, no music, no blooming flowers,  no bustle about with people and drinks and food.  West of the Drury was under construction with boarded up storefronts.  We started at the Drury and walked East to the last restaurant and came back west.  No app it is closed.  Missions closed.  Only two stores open for sidewalk shopping.  My suggestion is wait -  maybe when Texas opens up go at that time ."
We had the Riverwalk all to ourselves,"Due to Covid 19 and the extreme heat, the River Walk was isolated.  While sad in a way, it was simply amazing to spend several hours strolling down the banks with no one in sight..."
Can't beat the stroll!,We stayed at the Omni on the River Walk for the weekend and enjoyed the pleasant scenery and calmness of the river. We enjoyed people watching and sitting on our balcony in the evening celebrating from above. Lots of carriage rides and river boat rides all lit up! Beautiful!
A wonderful place to visit,"My wife and I took the boat trip around the river walk and really enjoyed the ride and the history of the downtown area. Lots of restaurants and shops, but a lot of the business were not open due to covid 19, The downtown area was deserted giving it an eerie feeling, but were were able to stay away from people so that was good."
"Covid - it is empty, but still nice",The riverwalk was almost deserted. But a lot of the shops were still open but they were close and earlier about 8:00 p.m.. I thought it was very interesting to get to walk around during normal hours and it is so empty. Still very pretty and a must attend.
Must see,Amazing views and amazing restaurants. The Riverwalk is actually about 11 miles. There are bike rentals along the entire trail.
River walk ,"River walk was nice, hardly any people on Friday. Of course more people showed up on Saturday but still clean and most people were wearing a mask."
Check before coming ,It was still nice to walk it and parts were breezy and enjoyable but of course many places affected by the virus. It was sad to see. Many tourists were gone but the homeless people are still here
Best Feature of Town,"This is the best feature of the town.  The river area is really beautiful, lots of landscaping and well-designed buildings.  You can book a boat ride.  Or just walk along and step into hotels and restaurants."
Short get a way. ,"Nice get a way , people are wearing mask. A lot of businesses are closed or 50% running but still a nice experience. This was a family vacation and had a good time."
lovely,i love this city so beautiful and full of abundant life i cant wait to return or possibly move to this city
Beautiful ,I had never been to the riverwalk before July of this year and I’m already trying to figure out how I can come back. It was stunning.
One of my favorite places on earth,"San Antonio is a great place to chill especially at the River Walk.  Go to a Mexican Restaurant on the water, have a fabulous Margarita, and listed to Mariachi music!  Life does not get any better!"
Sight seeing double decker,Loved the double decker! Kat was friendly helpful and knowledgeable! Great way to see the downtown area.
Pleased,"Love all the waterfalls and all the neat rock, stone and brick landscaping and the bridges.  Would love to be able to shop, due to COVID we could not do much of that."
Fun and interesting,"The San Antonio Riverwalk is unique to any city I've ever been in. I've been many times, but I'll never forget the sense of wonder I had the first time I visited years ago. Lots of history, food, etc. A great place to walk around and explore."
Relaxing Walk,i am hydrophobic but i enjoyed walking along this relaxing beautiful river fo sure! will go there when it is safe
Nice walk along the river,"During pandemic, it was the best it could be. It was hot when we were there, so make sure you stay hydrated (that was hard gor us with masks on)! The water looked thick and murky. Good path for running/walking. We stayed at a hotel right on the river, which made it all the more convenient. Most restaurants were open but very little business. I'm sure during normal times the place is bustling. We will go back when the pandemic is over."
Great Place for a Run,"My hotel was right on the River Walk, so it was a no brainer to go check the place out.  I had a great run along the River Walk. Many restaurants within the area.  You cannot go wrong visiting this place!  I highly recommend if you are in the area."
Love it!,"This was my second visit to the River Walk and I loved it.  Always so much to see and do.  No need to spend money, you can simply walk and enjoy the view.  This walk seemly goes on forever!"
Excellent time along the RiverWalk,"We spent mornings and late afternoons along the Riverwalk, enjoying the sights and sounds from the businesses and restaurants.  We were able to travel almost the entire length of the circle, as well as the canals leading to and from the Alamo area.  We enjoyed the small water features and artwork along the pathways.  The maps that are posted had some damage to them.  You have to be careful with the orientation of the maps within the loop.  We were able to sit on chairs at one of the hotels for a while.  We also sat on the steps of the stage area outside La Villata.  It was enjoyable to spend time there, out of the hot sun."
Beautiful and Relaxing,"The Riverwalk is a beautiful pathway lined with plants, flowers, shops, bars, and restaurants. We felt very safe from COVID, with most people wearing masks, and we saw several workers cleaning. It was a relaxing way to spend a weekend. We would love to come back to see one of the parades."
You cannot visit San Antonio without checking it out,This is the coolest place ever. I felt so safe walking here as two women day or night. It has awesome places to take pictures and great shops and restaurants along it. Not to mention you can get most places by walking through it instead of on the street
"Not bad, but still dirty","I know people love the Riverwalk and I have been many times. The big problem is it is very narrow walk ways. We went July 2nd and there were heaters along the walk way. Come on, does it get below 75 in July?Next the place needs to be power washed. There are a lot of areas that smell like pee."
Ms R,"Although, experiencing Covid the Riverwalk is open on a limited basis. No crowds and most everyone wearing face masks. It was a wonderful evening for us"
Beautiful!,Lot of walking on the beautiful River Walk.  Lots of stairs.  There are many different types of sitting areas along the walk.  Many restaurants on the River Walk. We ate at Casa Rio right on the RW.Enjoyed it!
Free walk,Needed to get away. I love walking in the Riverwalk. You get to see a lot of different things and stores and places to eat and hangout. There's always something to do there.
Great Way To Spend The Day!,We hadn't been to the River Walk in a number of years but it was as good as we remembered. Lots of restaurants and shops. It can be a bit hot in the Texas heat but is still a great way to spend an afternoon.
River Walk!,"Fun place to stroll. Very cool area to explore while in San Antonio! Lots of restaurants and shops. This is quite pretty at night with lights everywhere. Also interesting with fountains, waterfalls and wildlife...birds and ducks. Not to be missed."
Hard to Social Distance,This trip was during phase 2 of Co-vid re-opening.  Riverwalk had a lot of people visiting at the time we went.
Nice Afternoon Walk,"We went for a walk around the River Walk after lunch. Beautiful gardens, the water is a bit murky and dirty , but I guess that's to be expected! We had a nice time!"
San Antonio Trip,Loved the beauty and tranquility of the riverwalk. We walked it from the Alamo to our hotel near Houston St and thought it was fabulous! Due to COVID no boats were running and it was very peaceful. Some of the restaurants and stores were open but not all.
Great for pictures,"We went mid morning while it was still cooler. The weather prediction was 104 for afternoon. There are lots of places to sit and cool off.  We took the stairs directly across from the Alamo.  We walked approximately 3 miles in different directions taking some great photos.  Even though the Coronavirus is still active,  several places were open.  No boat rides yet. There were several restaurants open with patio seating.  We really liked all of the flowers and greenery.  We even saw a small opossum. This is a must do if you are in San Antonio."
Great place to spend the day.,We were there during the COVID 19 shutdown. Only a few shops and restaurants beginning to open back up so it was not crowded and very relaxing.
Best Stroll on a Weekend you can take in San Antonio,"You can enter the Riverwalk from any of a 100 ways - from the Alamo to one of the hotels along the several mile walk. One thing you can't do is walk the entire length without stopping for food and drink. AND DON'T WORRY, if someone is rowdy and pushes you into the drink, simply climb back out before a River Taxi runs you down. Most of the river is fairly shallow, and the cool dip might just the the thing you need to handle the summer in San Antonio. Watch out for the musket fire near the Alamo."
Beautiful and peaceful!,"We visited during the Covid-19 pandemic so the River Walk was not crowded. It is definitely a must see with its beautiful flowers, trees, waterfalls, quaint foot bridges and restaurants and bars. I can't wait to go back."
Saturday afternoon,"The boat rides have stopped due to the pandemic and only a few places are open. I only saw two tourist shops open, the western museum, and a few restaurants. It wasn’t crowded and made for a nice time to just enjoy the river walk. The ducks were swimming around and made for a great photo opportunity."
San Antonio Stole My Heart,"One of my fave place to visit in Texas. Many people think Austin is the best place to visit. However, I beg to differ, SAN ANTONIO is the best and most charming place to visit (I don’t leave any review for Austin lol). Try to walk theough the river in the morning or/at night - they both equally awesome. Surrounded by amazing big trees, restaurants and shops. Def will come back."
Very Relaxing ,Take time to see the view. Be mindful if you or a love one has sensitivity to sound. The waterfall is beautiful from the other side of the river but can be too loud for comfort with sound issues.
First time vistor,"This is an awesome trip for single, couple, or family easy walking and wheelchair accessible. fun to explore"
Bike Ride,So many miles of gorgeous scenery. Rode from hotel up to the Pearl District and then then further south. Walked along it multiple times during the trip. Nice to get lost and people watch and enjoy foliage. Very safe and well maintenanced.
Long and beautiful ,"Lots of foliage, restaurants, and bars. Found a lot of neat places even though some of it was still closed because of the plague. Few homeless people frequent it but they are harmless."
Beautiful and charming!,I've always loved the big trees that hang over the building and river. All of the lights and colorful restaurants and shops make for a beautiful walk.
Beautiful scenery,"Visiting TX for two weeks for the first time, and it was beautiful weather compared to MI! Would recommend comfortable walking shoes!"
Boating,Great place with plenty of restaurants which connects the Pearl district with downtown so you can walk between them.  They have lots of water taxis and tour boats going up and down the river so easy to get up and down.
Beautiful place to enjoy the evening,Tons of dining options and just very serine & pretty place. Nice mature landscaping. Great for walkers.
Beautiful,San Antonio Riverwalk is so beautiful! We came during Covid 19 and enjoyed do much walking around it.
Not for us...........,We only went here because we were with other people who wanted to go.  We also took the boat tour (against our will)  We didn't care for it either.  Cheesey tour guides and the river really isn't that wide.  Very touristy.
Peaceful walk around San Antonio Downtown Area,"This is not only practical but can also be a romantic walk through the city. I recommend it!!!You can enjoy of the view and stop by a restaurant, a museum or even a show stage."
Beautiful,Beautiful river walk plenty of gardens and small shops. We took the river boat along the walk learned a lot of history of the old buildings along the river
Great fun!,"We so enjoyed our first visit to San Antonio and the RiverWalk is such fun.  So many restaurants, people and music.  Be sure to take a boat cruise!"
Take the guided boat tour,Highly recommend taking the guided boat tour if this is your first time visiting the River Walk. You’ll get a great history lesson from the tour boat operator and enjoy a relaxing ride on the river as you get to see the shops and restaurants that line the River Walk.
"Delightful atmosphere, a nice walk","I like to go for walks anywhere I am and the San Antonio Riverwalk is a great place to get your walk in, lots of places to check out for eating, and watching the boats go up and down the river.  Just a very nice experience"
River walk,"Nice to see but just like all other river walks & their restaurants were crowded & expensive, better if you eat at 1 of their local places & they are more reasonably priced"
Everybody enjoyed this San Antonio River Walk. Wow! Even in the night!,We went to the San Antonio River Walk in the dark. We could see everything well anyway.We were walking near the river San Antonio.We found flowers and even a statue.There were ice-cream and restaurants.We had driven for a long time. It felt good to walk on the San Antonio River WalkI liked the bridges as well.There were Christmas lights all over. That was cool!There were some panels from history that explained the past in San Antonio.Worthwhile to see!
Nice walk,"The River Walk is a must when visiting San Antonio. Stroll along, watch the river boats go by, stop to eat. Definitely a fun experience."
River barge is great,Ride San Antonio’s river barge!  The Guides are awesome!!  You get a SA history lesson at the same time. Go during the Christmas season to see the lights. An awesome view!
"Eat here, eat there","We enjoyed walking, shopping, and eating along the River Walk, where there are a multitude of choices. It’s a great place to enjoy a stroll and do some people watching. It becomes lively in the evening with a variety of musicians through out."
beautiful,"Fantastic place to visit.  Great walking to look at so much & during the Christmas time, its beautiful. Parking can be difficult/pricey, but the overall views are fantastic!"
Riverwalk is a must,"Very nice attraction - seriously something for everyone! Truly enjoyed walking and taking in the sights, stores and restaurants. They are working on areas and can see a great deal of effort goes into maintaining the Riverwalk. I would have loved to see more water features functioning, but maybe that is just  seasonal."
Not as Impressive as We Expected,"Parts of the Riverwalk area are in dis-repair.  We booked a hotel room with a balcony view and looked out at two derelict building ""pigeon coops"" across the river."
Beautiful,"A beautiful, fun place to spend an afternoon.  Well designed, well maintained, and  just plain fun.  Many shops and restaurants to choose from.  A must see when in San Antonio"
Fun walk on the River Walk,We visited the River Walk just before everything was closing due to the coronavirus.  It was not busy at all.  The River Walk was very clean and there were so many restaurants and stores along the way.
Lovely walks,"Spent three days in San Antonio and walked the river every day, really nice walk to Pearl Brewery and nice area when you get there ."
First time in San Antonio...... spent hours on the Riverwalk!,Stayed at the Hilton Tru Hotel just a few blocks from the Riverwalk so we were able to spend 2 days exploring.  We like eating and drinking so this was a real good experience for us.  Met some friends and wondered around and had a nice time visiting various pubs and just enjoying the atmosphere and the music!
Romantic,"Beautiful scenery and city. It is very romantic to take the boat tour. People are friendly on the boat tour and it is great history about the city.  Plenty of shops, restaurants and hotels to choose from when walking around."
"It’s looking a little dated, but they’re working on it","We came here ten years ago and it must have been relatively new. We still enjoyed sitting along the River; it’s very unique in the United States. It is located just to the south and across the street from the Alamo, down a quick flight of stairs.It’s a great place to sit and have a drink and people watch."
Business,Great outdoor visit clean and interesting lots to do always beautiful sites and good exercise enjoy all there is to do
Beatiful walkwith lots of eats,I nice walk along the San Antonio river.  Has a lots of restaurants and shopping.  It can be rather busy at dinner time.  It is a must do when in San Antonio.
Delightful place to walk,We did this River Walk several years ago and were excited to get back to do it again.  We enjoyed daytime walks as well as the evening walks in the dark with all the lights making it so special.  It is clean everywhere and just a most lovely place to spend time.
Pretty walk,"Pretty walk, great way to get some exercise and get some sun.  Many excellent restaurants to choose from along the way."
Decent place but not quite what it was,"The walk was decent, some nice sight seeing but it's become about as touristy as Vegas. There's not a lot that seems to show San Antonio's culture."
San Antonio's biggest attraction,"The Riverwalk is one of San Antonio's main attractions, and for good reason. The natural river is peaceful and it's surroundings manage to be peaceful despite being in the heart of the city. There are numerous shops, restaurants, and attractions all along the river, something for everyone. You can walk, bike, or take a boat tour, all of which are worth it."
Nice atmosphere,"We took the boat cruise on the river.  The driver provided a great deal of information about the building, restaurant and about the flooding/recovery.    Would not have known this information without the tour."
Kind of it's own little city,"Do your research on restaurants/bars before you go.  Going by reviews some of the restaurants that looked like they'd be good walking or cruising through don't rate very well.  But the ones that have dining right along the walkway you can see if the food looks good while you're walking through.  Driving around downtown the next day we noticed that you'd never really even know it was down there, it's just like driving around any downtown."
Was on My Bucket List for Some Time,"We stayed at a hotel on the Riverwalk which made it that much more convenient to walk it.  We took the Go Rio night boat tour and we're glad we did - it made it that much more magical.  Of any of the places we visited in San Antonio, I'd go back here for a long weekend sometime."
One of the highlights of a San Antonio visit,If you're in San Antonio you must visit the River Walk. A tranquil and beautiful place in the early morning turns into a tourist bash by mid day.  Please note the best restaurants are not on the Riverwalk.
A very nice place to visit.,We spent a few days walking up and down the River Walk and had lunch at one of the restaurants and Happy Hour at Margaritaville.. I would not recommend the County Line for barbecue as it was very disappointing. We also did the River Cruise which we enjoyed.. I liked the River Walk but I only wish they had some daytime entertainment be it just someone playing a guitar and singing. That was my only disappointment no music. At night I think there are only two places that have music like a piano bar and not sure what the other one was.
Very Scenic,"The river walk was very scenic. It was more than I expected. The river is more live a canal that splits to sides of various restaurants, shops, lounges, clubs, and other entertainment venues with Texas flags flying all over the place. Surrounding the shops are tall hotels and other high rise buildings giving it a flavorful Texas feel. I had a good time on the rive walk. Whenever I go back to San Antonio, I’ll definitely pay another visit."
Something for everyone,"There is every kind of restaurant along the River Walk, from fast food to high-end fine dining. We walked the River Walk from our hotel near the Alamo to Pearl. It's a long walk, but there is a lot to see. We had great meals at Boudro's and Paesano's and both were surprisingly affordable."
Traveling,San Antonio is an amazing city. The Riverwalk is a great place to explore . The Riverwalk has a lot of amazing restaurants and shops. It is a wonderful walk along the river. Tree lined and stays cool even in those 100 degree days.
Ingenious,"If you’re doing San Antonio, you must do the River Walk.  After all, without it, what in the world would you do here if your stay is more than a day or so?  River Walk is no doubt the lifeline to this city.  What do you find here?  An extremely narrow walkway that is extremely close to water edge with no safety precautions.  Watch your little guys closely.  I was personally a nervous wreck with toddlers.  Shops are meh, food is upper crust, entertainment is varied.  Take an empty tummy and a full wallet."
Always wonderful!,"If you’ve never been, you need to come to SA to visit!  Lots of Mexican culture & tradition. Very nice for all ages. The Riverwalk and it’s story are very interesting and will give you memories for a lifetime!  Be sure and visit at night, too!"
Surprise,"I booked a Holiday Inn Express and got a Country Inn & Suites.  Not real happy about any of it. I paid for HIE and didn't get that.  On a lighter note, the breakfast was OK."
The city Gov. is destroying the Riverwalk,"This use to be such a beautiful place, and still could be if they would clean up all the filth, bums and panhandlers who smell extremely bad and who live along the Riverwalk amongst the visitors who have to pass through them along the way. There are places, one in particular, directly across the river from Casa Rio restaurant in the heart of things where bums are laying or sitting on the benches, urinating in the corners and when you pass through it smells like a filthy disgusting toilet. Through the entire place on either side of the river there is not much room to pass one another on the narrow walkways these parasitic filthy smelling bums are everywhere walking right amongst the visitors in the crowds. There were two occasions where they have acted out and police cuffed and removed them but not until a store or restaurant management called police to do so. There is not much security that you see anywhere around, but you do see workers walking around picking up trash and debris. This was our second visit to the Riverwalk, first 1997 and then last week, and what a difference, we will never return, and do not recommend this place to anyone until the City Gov. takes action to clean up the filthy, the bums, and the panhandlers."
A nice thing to see. ,I attended a conference at a hotel on the river walk.  The walk is a little narrow so I’m sure people probably fall in at times when it is crowded. The water is only about 4 feet deep. There are plenty of places to eat or drink.  It was pretty.
Awesome! Great Bars and Restaurants,A  must visit. There are tons of bars and restaurants. The River Taxis are Cool too!! Night time is safe and romantic
A short walk along the river,Enjoyed a nice evening walking around downtown San Antonio. Stopped in for a few beers and took a nice walk. It was a very nice relaxing time.
Must see,"We spent an afternoon here and ate lunch over looking the river, which was nice.  Didn’t do the boat ride, due to kids being tired.  Many places to shop, eat and drink.  Lots of pay-to-park places, but cost us $20 to park.  Walking distance to The Alamo."
Enjoyed,The San Antonio riverwalk is an enjoyable experience for any age of person. It is very lovely and relaxing. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Stop in for a bite to eat or a drink on one of many outdoor patios. Easy access to everything and the sites to take in. A must do if in the city!
Crowded! ,"This is a huge tourist destination. Or is that trap? Go off hours. It’s one overpriced, tacky restaurant after another. They say it’s no smoking but some restaurants have built 2nd floor balconies to get around the rules. Lots of drinking. It’s a cool idea in theory but be prepared for a lot of people jostling for bar space."
"MY HOME TOWN, and I highly recommend this!","You simply cannot come to San Antonio and not experience the River Walk! A ride on one of the river barges will give you a nice overview, then stroll up and down the walkways, take photos on the iconic bridges, and eat, drink, and shop to your heart's content. Be sure and stay all day because the riverwalk at night is magical!"
Fun,Great place for couples to visit great food nice and shady walkways pleasant people all around and flavors for everyone to enjoy
Unique experience ,"A very lively place. It is a must to take a cruise ride even if you have walked the whole area. When we took the cruise, the driver cum guide talked about how the river walk area was developed, about the natural and artificial river in that area, interesting facts about the premium hotels and buildings in the surrounding areas. I feel that without cruise, the river walk trip trip is incomplete."
Must visit,If you are in San Antonio a trip to the Riverwalk is a must. Great history and great restaurants. The boat tours are awesome too!
Junkie overdosed under commerce bridge,"My 12 yr old daughter and I were walking along the river enjoying the people, scenery, and ducks when we came across a man on his side passed out and vomiting under commerce street bridge. Someone else was already calling 911..... my daughter was shocked and I was scared for the man. Needless to say we didn’t enjoy the rest of the trip, I’m sure she won’t remember the sights but the experience she had here. Life altering to watch and feel."
Vacation ,"We enjoyed the restaurant's, & different places to shop. The scenery was beautiful. The people were very friendly & helpful. We had a wonderful time."
More than meets the eye.,Recommend that new visitors take a barge tour to learn where and what is on and around the river and canal.  Something for everyone.
the boats are grat,the boat ride was a welcomed change from walking in the heat. grab a cold drink and let the driver do all the work
Lived up to all expectations,Great ambiance and many food places. The ride on the river is worth the cost as we learned lots about it. County Line is a great place for BBQ
A great experience ,We visit the riverwalk at least a couple of times a year. I enjoy all the plants and flowers. My husband likes watching the ducks on the river. There seemed to be a lot of construction going on this visit. It’s very entertaining. Many fun restaurants and bars along the way
Great food & fun,"Lots to see and do on the River Walk.  Lots of bars, restaurants, and shops.  We always have a good time there."
Beautiful Place,Such a great place to visit with bars and restaurants all along the riverwalk.  Have been here twice now within a few years and will definately return.
Great Place to Visit,What a wise use of the riverfront! Wall to wall restaurants line the river providing visitors with a plethora of eating options.This is a must visit if you go to San Antonio.
The Riverboats are GREAT.,"I love best the one that goes all the way out to the Pearl Brewery but the shorter one around downtown is good, too."
"If the weather is right, it’s a lovely place to walk!","The River Walk is definitely a beautiful, scenic walk. There are plenty of excellent options for places to eat. If you park in a central area, you can also get around to other attractions nearby."
"Fun Place, nice Atmosphere!",The Riverwalk is probably the major attraction beside the Alamo in San Antonio. It is a pleasant place to walk in the middle of the city. There are many restaurants along the path and we had a chance to sample some of them. This is a must place for visitors.
2 days in San Antonio,"This is the tourist next main stop in San Antonio to the Alamo, this is a river that man has made into a shop and resturant venue, to me you have to see it , and it very nice but i would not advise to eat there, i had the worst Italian meal on our whole trip to Texas, you would be better if someone gave you a recommendation of where to eat but it was a nice walk, and you can do the boat trip, which we did not do, due to my wife becoming ill."
San Antonio Riverwalk,"Its a must do in San Antonio. Drop off at the Pearl and  visit the lovely boutigues and bars or stop at on of the many cafes, shops, and restaurants along the riverbank."
Something to do,My son just graduated from the Airforce.. everyone recommended the Riverwalk.  It was pretty and scenic with all its restaurants and shops.. I loved all the trees and floral..
Worth the walk ,"Walking it you get to see a number of restaurants and shops. There is the chance to do a river boat ride but you won't experience the whole thing. The downside, it can be quite busy."
Totally not what I expected,When I thought about the River Walk I imagined a river outside with shops and restaurants along the banks of the river.  This was more like a lazy river in a large circle with restaurants and shops.You can take a boat ride through the river walk as well as walking on foot. It was fun just not what I expected :)
Must do,The river walk is a must do in San Antonio. Many restaurants dot the path as it winds through the center of town. Hop on a tour boat or lounge at a restaurant along the shores of the river.
Lovely day for a walk,"We decided not to take a boat ride, as it was fun just to walk around and people watch. We stopped and had drinks outside and lunch. Met some wonderful people."
Special time seeing history and beauty,"We had a tour ride all around the River walk, 50 min ride is very well worth your time. You'll be surprised at all the stores and restaurants!!"
Very picturesque ,I’ve been coming to the river walk since I was a child. It’s really beautiful and walking along the river on a cool day when the sun is shining is just wonderful. Lots of restaurants to choose from
Very nice area,Such a nice area to walk around at or schedule a boat tour. Plenty of very good restaurants. Nice during the day or at night.
"Such a neat area, something for everyone","A must if you are in San Antonio. Walks and beautiful nature as well as restaurant, shopping and drinks. We love the atmosphere..."
Always pleasant,Weather was perfect and the Riverwalk not very crowded. Very clean and felt safe. No issues. Plenty of restaurants with quality food and service.
Treated myself to a trip to San Antonio,"Have not been to the River Walk in about 10 years so when the oppertunity came up for a day trip, I took it.  Little has changed as the Resturaunts are amazing and just a nice stroll on a sunny day is perfect.  What keeps the River Walk from getting an excellent review is the homeless people sleeping along the River Walk.  I did feel very safe, so don't let that be a large concern.  My heart does go out for them, circumstances, I am sure that were out of their control.  Had a nice lunch, walked around, and looked at all the shops.  Just a very nice day to myself."
Beautiful zone in the heart of San Antonio,Since the river is below street level you can't see it driving through downtown. Park the car and spend the afternoon and evening walking along the river and stopping at the shops and restaurants along the way.
Magical River Walk,So much to see so many people happily engaging with the wonderful restaurants and shops along this magical walkway in San Antonio. We could walk for miles.
Tranquility,Took a stroll around the river walk. It feels like Italy. Beautiful gardens along the way. Colorful tables out in front of the restaurants . Little shops along the way. Took the boat ride and the driver was fun and very knowledgeable  of the surroundings. Many awesome bridges to go under made for great pictures.
A MUST for San Antonio,"After a short visit to the Alamo, the River Walk can be days of exploration from the restaurants and the Mission and the Museum reaches."
River Walk,We loved the river walk. Especially the informative boat ride. Many outstanding restaurants to enjoy.
The river of life,"One can take an hour or spend days exploring the Riverwalk. I enjoy it all and come back time and time again.  It can be a noisy, lively, hot spot with hotels, restaurants, and more.  It can also be a stroll south to see the 300 year old Spanish missions.. Or, it can be the site for a run or walk  north to the revitalized Pearl area and the Museum Reach. If you like art you might stop at the San Antonio Museum of Art or end up at the Witte Museum with its Texana and Natural History exhibits."
Night on the Riverwalk,"So first, as an adopted Texan i should admit, there is no real river. It’s more of a canal. It is a great place to hang with friends and pay stiff prices for great food and beverages. It’s a tourist trap so be prepared for pricey food and crowds. But it’s a lot of fun!"
Charming!!!,"What a lovely place to go and take a stroll. Stop at any of the restaurants and sit waterside for a cold one and an appetizer, lunch or dinner. They have created such a quaint place to sit and relax. Great place to people watch!!!"
The Romantic Riverwalk,The best time to take a leisurely stroll along the San Antonio Riverwalk is at Christmas time when the river is illuminated with thousands of colorful lights. It’s like an enchanting fairy land. There are activities and events scheduled year round along the river. One of San Antonio’s highlights and “must sees”
Very informative and nice relaxing boat ride..,We booked as part of a package including three days hop on hop off bus and tower of the Americas. We choose to do this on our last day and it proved a good choice as queues were heavy on the weekend.
"Where""s the River","Sorry, San Antonio in most places in the real world 4 feet of water is actually a creek. I ate a few places along the creekside the food was quite unremarkable and the service was okay at best.The city is so small-minded and tribal. Caters to one culture."
Cozy river ride,We had a very romantic river barge ride. It was an evening ride with the river lit up spectacularly. Enjoying our hot coffee and people  watching. Amazing restaurants all along the river.
River Walk in SA is a nice break from the heat,"We travel often to SA and in the summer it can be quite busy and hot. The river walk is nice because if you get back on the trail, parts of it are very quiet, shady and cooler. It's a fun walk, you can always find a place to stop and grab a Gelato, Margarita or Taco."
Pearl brewery,Excellent day! Lots of individuals with great items for sale. Great cheeses wines fresh fruits and veggies
Riverwalk Saltgrass,Incredible bar service! Manager outstanding and friendly. Food is always great and cooked just the way you like it.
Nice stroll along the river.,This is a unique area to visit. There are lots of shops and restaurants long the river and the river boat tour was very fun and informative for us. The four star rating is because we felt that it could be kept a little cleaner. Not that it  was terrible but for a place that attracts to many visitors it need some maintenance.
A lovely spot in the city,Beautiful and soooo much to do!  The restaurants were excellent and the shops were plentiful.  Even more special was the beauty of the riverwalk and the easy access to it.
Don't miss the famous River Walk,"Lots of restaurants in some sections and places to order drinks.  We were there in late February so the flowers were just starting to open.Prices for food and drinks is high, you pay for the convenience."
Holiday spirit everywhere,"Gorgeous, peaceful, beautiful, quaint. A great way to get in the Christmas spirit. Food was excellent, weather was beautiful, staff were friendly. A great weekend getaway to disappear from the hustle and bustle of every day life. Especially beautiful with the Christmas decorations up!"
River Walk  - not to be missed,"If you should ever find yourself in San Antonio, do not miss their famous River Walk.  It was faboulous.  The walk is a city park and network of walkways along the banks of the San Antonio River, one level beneath the city streets and it's lined with all kinds of shops and restaurants.  We took the boat cruise down the river during the evening and it was lovely to see all the lights of the city from the water.  They have since dug and added canals to extend and manage the river walk.  Absolultely a great experience!"
Fun to people watch,Good fun.  Good food.  Can be a bit over-priced.   We enjoyed tex-mex and margaritas while watching the people stroll by.
Wonderful!,"Multiday stay at the Hilton Palacio del Rio.  Walked many steps on the Riverwalk. Great for people watching.  Lots of good shops, restaurants and bars throughout.   Highly recommended."
Meander your way through SA,"Perfect weather, delicious food, great sights & shops....what more could you ask for.  We walked from one end to the locks and back.  Great exercise, beautiful scenery.  Bathrooms at the locks."
Beautiful place,"I loved the beauty of the river walk. I like the river tour.  I would like to see a brochure, with a good map, or visitor center with more details of everything that is available on each day so you could plan your day better because it is a lot of walking. Our food and drinks were very good everywhere we went."
Nice tour,The access to the walk level is by steps or elevator. The elevator is convenient from the Alamo location. However there are limited locations to buy tour tickets so you have to walk before you ride. The boat tour is non stop (no hop on-off). Eating spots on both sides of walk so you need to know where the bridges are. Tour was well narrated and informative.
Wonderful and relaxing!,"The Riverwalk is a great way to spend some time whether you want peace and quiet or action!  The main Riverwalk where all the restaurants and hotels are is busy, fun and engaging!  Many great restaurants-all kinds! Ice cream places and small shops.  We stayed on the Riverwalk and it was so much fun!  And from the Riverwalk we walked downtown (about 5 miles) which led to quiet, beautiful art filled areas, flowers, etc.  Alot of art along the way.  The path was in excellent shape and very, very clean.  We saw no homeless once we left the downtown area.  You can walk from the Riverwalk all the way down to the Pearl which is also a fun place."
River Walk,"Great venue with numerous options for food, shopping and entertainment.  Felt very safe which is always a good thing."
Predictable Tourist Destination,Very similar experience to the gondola ride at the Venice casino in Las Vegas.  All the same (or similar) shops and restaurants along a waist-deep water feature.
Wonderful!,"We have been to San Antonio 3 times in the last 4 years and really enjoy the walk along the river with all of its restaurants, shops and table vendors. Always so enjoyable."
A great way to enjoy the City!!,"This is the most amazing concept , build a tourist zone around a river, and offer transportation. If you are looking to browse, people watch or just wand this is it. There are so many restaurants to eat at, stores to buy souvenirs, everything under the sun. You can get all over downtown and walk over miles to other locations, neat and super clean, plus its safe at night."
Beautiful walk down the river with a ton of culture,"It’s a gem of San Antonio - nice flowing river, restaurants and shops which are amplified at night. Want to just have a stroll up or down the river? Avoid the shops and take a stroll north or south - incredible feature of the city with museums, art and theatre literally steps away from the route."
Stop!  Don't forget to visit the river walk and take a boat tour,The river walk is such a fun place to visit during hour visit to San Antonio.  Take the time to take a leisure stroll down the over 15 miles of walkway.   I could spend a goo portion of the day just walking the river banks looking for Turtles and taking in the river area.  Also plan on taking a boat tour or buying a 24 hr pass for the river shuttle from downtown to the Pearl / Emma Hotel.
Riverwalk beauty ,"I visited on a gorgeous day.  The walk is amazing.  The busy shopping and dining areas are lively and can get get crowded but if you keep walking, you will come upon long stretches  of just scenery.  Absolutely adored the riverwalk!"
River Walk San Antonio,"A beautiful walk along this branch of the San Antonio River in downtown SA.  Barge rides are a pleasure, with entertaining comments from the captains. Many great restaurants & pubs. Best to walk during day; weekend nights get very crowded."
A neat place to spend time shopping and dining,We visited the river walk 3 times during our week vacation there. It's a neat place to visit with the San Antonio River meandering through the city. Little shops and restaurants line the banks. You can take the Go Rio boat for 30 minutes to learn the history of the area. You can enter and exit the river walk at different points. It's a great place to visit.
Love the Scenery,"Beautiful, safe, and inviting. Stroll, sit for awhile, jog. The foliage and the flowers are delightful."
Vibrant ,"We returned there twice to have a lunch and a walk. Such a wonderful place. We stopped at ole Mexican restaurant and next to it Italian I think called michelins.... food was awesome, service was the best ever! It was cold in San Antonio but it was such a warm place to visit. We collected some Mardi Gras beads"
Peaceful and lovely river walk under mature trees and interesting bridges.,"For those who think that all of the attractions  are overpriced and expensive, I’d like to say that while in many cases that is true, there are still places where the attractions cost nothing. One of such places is the peaceful and lovely San Antonio river walk that includes many interesting stops. If you would like to enjoy some of the natural stops, a cold non alcoholic drink like an iced tea could enhance the experience. Also for the perfect ending, there are wonderful eateries all around the riverside where one can end a lovely walking day before going to the hotel."
Beautiful and romantic,Beautiful and romantic. The tour guide was great! His name was Juan and had us informed and laughing the entire trip on the boat. We were able to drink on the boat and while walking on the river walk. They also have a fence with locks like the famous one in Paris. One of my favorite places in Texas.
Lunch on the river,We did the Alamo in the morning and the Riverwalk for lunch and the afternoon. We enjoyed the whole experience!
Great Walk on the river,"Wow, bustle and movement but it is so fun!!! Great walk and lots of restaurants to choose from. I haven’t been in 30 years and was amazed how it has really grown and it is so clean!!!"
I always enjoy wlaking the riverwalk,"I always enjoy walking the riverwalk (or rather running along the riverwalk in the morning for my exercise). Its well lite, safe and clean. Ive covered most of it by foot (running). Plenty of places to stop, rest and just people watch."
Fabulous place to walk,"We were here in February and really enjoyed walking up and down the walk. We stayed in the Pearl District, which is much more trendy and pleasant than downtown - but each area has it's own charms. The San Antonio Art Museum is a great place to stop on the walk."
"San Antonio, Texas - Riverwalk, Alamo, Segway Tours and More","LODGINGWe stayed at the Hyatt Regency Riverwalk.  This location was central for the activities we had planned.  Hussain (concierge) was very helpful.  He suggested we visit their Hyatt Club and offered incentives (paying for activities we planned) if we did.  We did not elect this option.  GASTRONOMY:  We ate dinner at Boudro's on the Riverwalk. The tableside guacamole made by our waiter, Tracey, was so good alongside our margaritas.  Our meals were excellent - blackened fish, veggies & red potatoes and shrimp & grits.  Tracey suggested the Petz and Hall chardonnay for our meal.   We stopped for a margarita at Rita's one afternoon (Rita’s was suggested by a friend of ours).  We were disappointed – the service was slow, and the margarita tasted more like limeade than a margarita.  We ate dinner at Casa Rio – WOW!  My husband selected the combination meal which included two enchiladas, a tamale, a taco with refried beans and all the fixings.  The portions were generous.  I had mixed green salad with an excellent lime vinaigrette dressing.  I asked for the recipe, but they said is was secret.  We also tried their hot salsa – which lived up to the name – a bit too hot for our Minnesotan taste.  The frozen margarita and skinny margarita were excellent. We ate lunch at Buckhorn Saloon and Museum.  The food was good; there was a good selection of beers to select.  Bill Miller Bar B Q.  This restaurant was recommended by Robert (our Segway tour guide).  We tried the ribs, brisket, fried chicken and sides.  This place offered great food at a reasonable price.  Menger Hotel has a must try mango ice cream.  A tasty treat on a hot Texas day.Hyatt Q Bar – good chocolate martini.  Isaac, bartender, was informative and fun to talk with.TOURS/SITES:  We walked along the Riverwalk as they were celebrating Mardi Gras.  There were many decorated boats riding along the river, music and throwing beads to the crowds.  We missed signing up for a guided Alamo tour by minutes, so instead purchased the handheld device which provided information at specific numbered sights.  We also went to the San Jose mission which is largest of the 5 missions.  The main church on site was holding their mass services on the morning we were there, so we attended.  The worship music was great with the mariachi band.  The inside of the church was beautiful and colorful.  Segway Nation tour with guide Robert.  We had not ridden a segway before, so Robert provided a quick lesson for us.  We traveled throughout the area stopping along the way where Robert shared details about landmarks around the city (Alamo, Buckhorn Saloon, Menger Hotel, Rivercenter Mall, Hemisfair Park, La Villita and San Fernando Cathedral).  Our tour was scheduled for 90 minutes, but last 2 hours which was wonderful.  Robert provided great insights."
A must see city,"What a fabulously beautiful city.  It feels like you are at Walt Disney world walking along the river Walk.  All lite up at night, restaurants and bars, full of life."
A very unique experience,"We were so lucky to be in San Antonio at Mardi Gras celebration. It was fun, but oh so crowded. I truly am surprised no one ended up in the river. But the Boat parade on the river was really a treat, especially catching beads. The street vendors were fun, and a great time."
"Just a Cool Place to relax, stroll around and enjoy peaceful surroundings","Sometimes you just need to chill out and this is a great place to do it.  Stroll beside the river banks, watch the ducks, forget all your cares.  When you're done, grab something to eat and shop.  The perfect day all within walking distance."
1st time visit,"We walked much of the River Walk and enjoyed it very much. So much to see, very relaxing! Need to come back as too much for one day.."
San Antonio River Walk,"Wonder full, excellent experience to enjoy with your couple , family or friends.  San Antonio have so many activities, transportation option and more."
You must experience the River Walk,Be sure to take the boat tour and then do some walking.  The boat guide will give some information along the way.  The landscaping is beautiful.
Walking senior.,"Restrooms. bathrooms are very difficult to locate,  The stairs are difficult to walk up or down  for older  visitors.  The restaurants are not easy to access.  And the prices are inappropriate for the average tourist."
Beautiful ,The river walk has a bunch of restaurants and cute shopping places. You can also take boat tours across the river. Didn’t get the time to do it this trip but definitely going to do it next time!
Lovely,I love this area. I like seeing the water between the buildings and the bridges going across. The architecture is lovely. I feel like I'm in another country!
Dinner,"Excellent service by Daniel! Food was amazing! Highly recommend the Chicken Parmesan! Indoor and outdoor eating. Reasonable prices, good wine. Located right on Riverwalk."
Relaxing and enjoyable ,Very relaxing to walk and enjoy the sites.  So many wonderful restaurants to try!! Cannot go wrong with the food choices. And the lights at night are beautiful.
Walking ,Great walking area they've gotten rid of junk shops super choices on food and restaurants usually some seat on river
River Walk,Great place to take group of kids on a sports team to see something of the city and to get some stretching/exercise in.
Commercial ,Wished it was more quaint shops but it was so much of the same .. not really a needed stop on my trip
San Antonio's River Walk Is Delightful,If you're in San Antonio you must walk the River Walk both day and night.  It's beautiful and delightful.  The river winds about the town and many restaurants and cocktail lounges are located right on the walk so you can stop and imbibe or eat whenever you're in the mood.  There is a boat right that looks pleasant but we didn't take it.
Fun experience ,What a wonderful experience of restaurants and entertainment.  We had a great time. It is highly recommended.
Great time ,"The Riverwalk it is quite lovely and can be very relaxing. We accidentally stumbled on Mardi Gras which was a blast. Great music, fun floats everyone was having a great time."
Great escape,Enjoyed strolling through San Antonio using the River Walk instead of fighting traffic on the sidewalks. It leads to alot of great attractions and fairly easy to navigate with plenty of access to street level
Great place to spend a day,Loved this place. We’re from Atlanta and we don’t have any place this nice in Atlanta. This River Walk stretches for miles and you are only limited by your walking abilities. Always close to shops and restaurants.
Fun time and much to do!,"First time in San Antonio. River walk is a happening place. So glad we bought tickets for the boat tour at the river walk, it was more expensive on line. We went early when it was less crowded and enjoyed the 30 minute boat tour.  Sort of disappointed, we thought the ride would be longer and could see more of the river and downtown. You only need to do this once, or would skip if ever return. A lot of places to eat and shop along the river walk, very touristy.  Went to the Alamo in afternoon and it was super crowded, go early to avoid crowds. The outdoor presentation was great and well worth the 30 minutes. Beautiful grounds and right downtown.  Definitely know what is happening local before you go, live shows, ballet, and concerts happening right downtown."
See It In Daylight,"We enjoyed walking the river walk during the day to experience the architecture, botanical gardens and even the ducks. We leisurely walked in all directions making frequent stops whenever something caught our eye. It was easily accessible and not very crowded. We particularly liked watching a taxi boat navigate through the lock system and reading the historic plaques along the banks.We did eat lunch twice in the charming outdoor cafes and have to say both times the food was quite under expectations.  I would advise having coffee or drinks instead.We returned in the evening to a chaotic, crowded Disneyland atmosphere rather than a beautiful romantic canal. Evening is the time for drinking and partying, not to experience the beauty of the river walk."
The Visual Definition of Romance,"The riverwalk was amazing.  It was my first visit and I didn't have any expectations.  I fell in love, was in awe of the area. There was ao much too see or do. Perfect place for a romantic getaway"
Canal ride was a highlight,"Visited here recently, and enjoyed the canal boat ride most of all. The guides point out interesting sites and tell you facts as you go. Lovely evening tour. Reasonably priced.  The walk itself was incredibly crowded and you can barely walk for all the outdoor tables where people are dining, and waiters are going back and forth, not to mention the general population trying to walk down the sidewalk here! I found it frustrating to try to enjoy a walk to see what was there even."
Scenic Route,The River Walk has great restaurants & shops! It’s a nice way to travel through the city. There are plenty of ducks 🦆 to greet you at every turn.
Rainy dayd,The riverwalk is a must for a visit to San Antonio. Good restaurants and beautiful plants even in the rain.
Not to be missed,It was very crowded since it was Valentine's Day weekend. One to two hour wait for restaurants.  Plan ahead
Charming area,Lots of variety in restaurants and shopping. It’s in walking distance from the Alamo. Lots of outdoor restaurant seating along river. You may want reservations.
Interesting ,Beautifully designed. Lots of restaurants and bars. A few shops but not what I expected. Still a nice walk along the River. Watch little ones as there is nothing between them and the river.
Very Fun,"Beautiful, lots to do and see! The riverwalk offered lots of restaurants and shops! The water and greenery was very neat!"
Brilliant example of progressive urban design,"The Riverwalk is pleasant even in February (when not raining/snowing). Very interesting little protected/recreated village just above the river amphitheater. Otherwise, lots of hotels, bars, and restaurants."
Interesting,Loved the river walk.  Restaurants along the way are a bit expensive. But the river walk itself is very nice. Especially when you get away from the touristy areas.
"Romantic, Friendly and amazing stroll alone","The San Antonio Riverwalk is along the San Antonio River about 12ft or so below the road area, lasting over quite a few miles. The main river portion has frequent stairs that lead up to the road level, so you won't be more than a block or so away in front or behind you.There is an off shoot loop from the main river, where many of the shops are located and is well worth the stroll. We suggest you pause along the way to visit a shop, have a drink or snack at any of the shops. We walked about 6 miles every day, just by strolling, so we got our exercise and had a fun time. Now boat tours that last about 1/2 hr. are available, costing about $15, and strongly suggested. The seating can be a bit crowded, but it all depends on timing. While the day time cruise is enjoyable and you can indeed see things, the evening cruise is romantic as the different lightings enhance the images. Don't forget to pause at the ""theater"" on the river, some may recognize it from a movie seen as well.So come enjoy and you can fill up several days, without doing the same things twice.Enjoy!"
San Antonio Riverwalk - overrated ,Been here numerous times over the last 30 years. Doesn’t get better. Other much better places to hang out or East in San Antonio.
Riverwalk was a nice way to experience San Antonio,Riverwalk was clean and safe with lots of restaurant and hotel options.  Very pleasant time with riverboats available
River Walk,We enjoyed the river walk very much.  So much to do and see.  We also did the boat river cruise and enjoyed it so much.  It was very informational and relaxing.
"Pleasant place, but less than hospitable","We could walk several blocks to the Riverwalk from our motel and, as we are older, that was especially nice. There are lots of shops and restaurants along the river, but very few restrooms were open to the public. Even the place where we bought boat ride tickets did not have a functioning restroom, so we had to go searching for facilities instead. We were told we had to go in town and we finally found a bank that was welcoming."
Very nice walk,"All the main attractions are accessible from the Riverwalk and it’s a beautiful walk with entertainment, shopping and dining along the way and boat tours."
Great place to people watch,"If you want an excellent place just to walk around and people watch, in a peaceful environment, look no further. Good food, good night life as well as day life and just an amazing place to look around, take the boat and show. Can get pretty warm in the summer but otherwise its great."
A novel activity for locals and tourists,"The San Antonio River Walk has been one of the most favored spots for tourists. However, the River Walk offers new experiences for locals too. I visited in December, and I noticed many tourists complained that the water was ""dirty"". Of course it “looked dirty” but only because the wind was blowing all the tree leaves into the water. It would be difficult to keep it clean when there is a constant flow of leaves. What I also observed was that there were quite a diverse group of locals and tourists, making the boat tour more interesting. One can hear a variety of languages being spoken and this makes one wonder where these individuals came from or what their expectations were. The choice of clothing attire that people wear in these outings can easily become a conversation theme. The number of eating places is great and the choices of menus are abundant. The river meanders through the city and it provides for a leisurely walk. Observing the nice variety of flowers, trees, ducks, birds, stores, and buildings makes the time pass quickly.   Flat, covered toe shoes, tennis or comfortable shoes will make the experience more enjoyable. Do not rush this activity as you will miss valuable opportunities to meet new people."
Fun with teens in the winter,We had fun walking around with our 2 tweens. It was cold but interesting to see everything. Only negative was signage for directions were bad. And the staff weren’t that helpful either. Got lost several times.
Coolest walk I have had,"So much to see and take in, if you go away hungry, thirsty or bored, it's your own fault. Great walk, great sights, plus great San Antonio hospitality. Would recommend when in the city. We went back several times and saw different things each time."
Family Visit,A great place to take the family.  The kids live the touring boats.  They were so informative.  Great signs for directions.
"Fun walk, great sights",Walking along the river walk is a lot of fun.  There are resturants along the banks of the river that are perfect for having a meal with a friend or family member.  We ate at a couple of resturants and they were all good.  So many resturants - so little time.
Amazing trip,"The Riverwalk was an awesome adventure, the boat ride, the history, the shear ingenuity of this feat was well worth the 2 days exploring it all. Wonderful eats incredible sights. A must do thing while in San Antonio!"
Great time on the Riverwalk,"Spent 3 days in San Antonio and visited the river walk all three days and nights. What a great experience. Great shops, great foods and a lot of people watching."
Relaxing on the River,"San Antonians have long cherished the River Walk and the new river walk expansions have added to our pride. Take a quiet stroll or join those briskly walking for exercise.  Head in a different direction each day. No matter how you use the paths, you won’t regret it."
A must when in San Antonio,A magical place during the Holidays! We enjoyed a cruise on the river. The lights and decorations were awesome!
River visiting,"This is the Riverwalk.Not altogether wheelchair friendly, like most of the outdoors.There are areas without railing.The river taxi is a good optionRiverboat rides are an option.Generally, things are more expensive in tourist areas, this is no exception.But very clean, theme park clean.Mexicans and Mexican food are to be expected.Almost everyone speaks English.Spanish is available.If lost, the yellow shirt people can get you there."
Not Up to Par,"Noticeably disappointing. Unless you are there to drink and walk around, pay way too much for everything, and eat gross food, I would skip it. Looked trashy, smelled horrible, and the restaurants were terrible and overpriced. I suggest- do the riverboat ride, then leave ( if you are willing to pay the crazy $15  parking)"
Hop on hop off bus tour,Excellent job by TC.  Made the visit fun and informative.  Learned many new things about San Antonio.would recommend the service for everyone.
River Walk,It was a lovely and wonderful place to spend a couple hours after visiting the Alamo. We found the Iron Cactus restaurant and enjoyed eating on the patio. This is a must do for any visitor to San Antonio!
Escape Wisconsin Trip,"We spent the evening on the Riverwalk while visiting San Antonio.  Plenty of dining options along the route with indoor and outdoor seating.  You can walk the route or hop on a narrated river bot ride that takes you up and around several portions of the route for about $13 per adult.  Discount for military, senior, and kids.  If you come to San Antonio, this is a must visit area of the city!  Will be back again as there is so much to explore along the Riverwalk."
Great walk! ,"So pretty! Eat, shop, or just leisurely stroll along the river for however long you wish. Simply beautiful."
Nice area for walking in the citycenter,"This is a nice area in the center of the town, not fare from Alamo. The river goes through the city and along the river lays a lot of restaurants."
Valentines ,"Plenty of restaurant choices......wide variety of food choices. Fun, festive atmosphere. One of our favorites is the German restaurant."
2020,"We brought in the new year here and it was awesome. Shops, good food and music we didn’t need anything else."
Fantastic Plus,"We throughly enjoyed exploring the river walk during our stay in San Antonio. Lots of interesting architecture, restaurants and thinks to see."
River Walk,"Walk the walk and cruise the river. Also, take the site seeing double-decker red bus to see other sites as well as the Farmers' Market."
A must see!,A very nice walk along the river and a great way to visit local shopping and eat at the many restaurants along the riverwalk.
Good Time,Walked the sides but the boat tour (30 min) was awesome. Lots of history and trivia. Eat and drink to your hearts content.
A beautiful walk and boat ride enjoyed eating overlooking the river,A nice Two days spent enjoying the town.  Took the hip on and hip off bus.  We stopped for Texas barbeque and enjoyed the sights of the town.
Riverwalk @ Christmas,"A whole lot of fun.  Enjoyed the beautiful lights, good food, and the fabulous boat ride.  The kids were excited to see everything the River walk has to offer.  We didn't mind the wait for the boat just enjoyed watching the crowds.  It was so festive."
Riverwalk is a must see at Christmas,"We are in San Antonio week before Christmas.  It was very nice and the Riverwalk was decorated with lights.  It was a beautiful place to be at Christmas.  We booked the a river cruise at night and had a great time. Also, we walked the Riverwalk during the day and saw the sights."
Awesome,"Forget the Alamo, the River Walk is one of the most well layed-out downtown dining/shopping/leisure areas I have visited in the United States.  We took the boat tour, and enjoyed learning about the history.  Had our choice of countless restaurants most of which were appropriately priced.  Good time in a beautiful area."
River Walk,"I had a great time down there , the people are friendly and the service where ever I stopped was great."
Loved the Riverwalk!,"This was one of my favorite places in San Antonio.  We spent time enjoying the sights and went back to the Riverwalk to enjoy dinner, shop at the mall and enjoy the people."
"Always, always a pleasure to visit!",The San Antonio Riverwalk will never disappoint any time of the year. The restaurants along the river are fantastic. I prefer Paesano's for the shrimp Paesano. It is specially beautiful around the holidays with the holiday lights.
Dinner and drinks / date night,"Had an awesome time, food was great, drinks were amazing and best part people were friendly. Had a great date night"
sisters night out,Riverwalk is beautiful.  We visited during Christmas.  The only set back was there were too many vendors it was hard to walk thru.
What a wonderful use of a natural setting!,We enjoyed the lively atmosphere of the many eateries and shops along the river walk. Truly something for everyone.
Surprise!!!,"Make a reservation!I was taken to this beautiful resturant on a date. It is very eclectic,modern,romantic with a beautiful evening tone. The food!!!The FOOD is equally delicious!!! We started with the Grilled Squid then Corn Ravoli, Eggplant Parmesan, Grilled Cauliflower.To full for desert on this visit.The prices are a good."
Pretty at night!,"Even in February The Riverwalk is worth exploring! It was great after sitting in a conference all day to get out and walk. Hearing birds and seeing flowers in bloom in the middle of February was a treat for this girl from up north. It’s pretty all lit up at night, too!"
Early morning,My favorite time time to walk on the river in early. Absolutely lovely and quiet. Several people are out running and exercising. Our visit centered around the conference center but it is easy to break away and enjoy the many hidden nooks and crannies of the river. San Antonio is a beautiful city with many adventures steps away from this area.
Night at River walk,"During the Christmas holidays it's beautiful down at San Antonio riverwalk the day after Thanksgiving the Christmas tree lighting takes place now at Travis Park this is a yearly tradition. The huge Christmas Tree used to be at the Alamo. We enjoy coming downtown to the riverwalk especially during the Christmas season. Beautiful decorations and lighting , Christmas riverwalk parade."
Great place to stroll,"This was my second time to San Antonio and the weather this time around was much nicer, especially for strolling on the River Walk. We walked a good portion of it, then jumped on the boat for a ride up to the Pearl area.  It was great fun!"
"Food, scenery to please all!","Have visited the River Walk literally a hundred times!  Never a bad meal, the restaurants keep their quality up and avoid ""tourist trap"" cuisine!  Sometimes the hardest part is deciding which place to eat at! Entertainment options from Jazz to comedy, and of course the walk is lovely.  parking options have improved to if you don't take ride option.  Enjoyed the boat/meal cruise a couple of times too. A must do stop when we have guests in town!"
Omni Le Mansion on the Riverwalk,"We had a lovely time at the Riverwalk, it was the middle of the week, so not a lot of people. Amazing food and drinks and a very romantic, relaxing ambiance."
Must see,Excellent place to visit with great bars and places to eat.You must go on a boat ride around it and see the architecture
Riverwalk,"The Riverwalk is beautifully decorated at Christmas time. Lights everywhere!! It's a must see when you have out-of-towners! The ambiance is undeniable..  Fun, fun, fun..."
Excellent attraction,The riverwalk wanders through shops and restaurants and the canal boat ride is enjoyable with informative commentary. Wide choice of restaurants and coffee shops as well as tourist shopping
The River Walk,Great place to spend the day or night. We had the chance to visit with local friends and being the off season the crowds were not an issue. Beautiful landscape with adorable shops and restaurants. Stopped to eat and drink at a couple of restaurants were we ate by the river. You can also take a small river boat tour and learn some history. Make sure you bring good shoes and plan for at least 4 hours. We heard that during the night everything is lit up and the atmosphere is totally different. Gives me an excuse to go back!
Beautiful Scenic Walk,"We walked from our hotel to town, it was really beautiful and we really enjoyed it.  It was a good walk, but we really did like getting some steps in with all the good food we have been eating!"
Lovely as always!,Consistently a nice walk and brimming with food and beverage options.  This was my second visit and Inwouldnt mind going again!
Tremendous  Place to Visit - Wine and Dine,This is a must place to see. Walk or ride the taxi ferry down the channel. Stop and eat or shop. You can also take a tour.
A Must See,"I had seen the River Walk at Christmas time on TV and after our relocation to Texas last summer, my husband and I took a weekend vacation in San Antonio and stayed right on the River Walk.We went walking in the evening and it was magical, with all the Christmas lights hanging from the trees and the farolitos along the way (we called them luminarias in Arizona).There are lots of restaurants and businesses along the walk, and it was a very festive atmosphere. I wish we had been able to do a boat tour but those have to be booked in advance, which I will do next time we come down to San Antonio.With that said, as I mentioned, there are many restaurants and businesses along the way, but be wary of tourist traps. Nevertheless, when visiting San Antonio, along with the missions, the River Walk is a must see."
You must see the Riverwalk,If you go to San Antonio and don’t visit the Riverwalk then you’ve not been to San Antonio. It is beautiful and most businesses on the surface have much better Riverwalk storefronts. The dining there is the best in the city.
Mini Trip,"Went on a mini vacation with 4 kids and enjoyed the view. It was a short trip so we weren’t able to walk all of it. Most of what we saw was restaurants, bars, and small shops. Once you make it past that it’s peaceful to walk. We didn’t make it on a tour boat like we wanted but have plans for that next time."
River Walk at the holiday season,The San Antonio River Walk was very beautiful in December. I did the river walk while I was there. It was beautifully lit up. The tour on the river was great.
FUN TIME,My wife and I visited the Riverwalk for 2 days and it did not disappoint. Just a great place to walk with lots of shops to visit and tons of restaurants. You can also take a leisurely boat ride that lasts about 40 minutes and is actually interesting as you learn a lot about the city that you might not on known.A must see if visiting San Antonio.
Obviously must do ,This is why we came to San Antonio. Only thing I was upset about was there weren’t enough lights. Apparently the big light display is only during the holidays which somehow we missed. But still felt like it would be lit up a bit. It was beautiful to walk during the day though! No crowds. Every turn was different and unique!! I felt an overwhelming sense of peace while walking along the river. We also found free parking over by the cathedral after 6! So there are cheaper ways to park. Or we just walked from our hotel.
CitySightseeing san antonio,Kat was our bus driver both days.  She gave us a lot of information  and was friendly and made us feel great. Great job driving that  bus.
Great restaurants,Walked a lot of the River walk and did a boat ride on it as well. Our Captain of the boat was very informative as well as having a great sense of humor. Well recommended especially the boat ride that explained a lot of the history of San Antonio.
Really lovely!,I had heard about riverwalk when researching where to stay. It is a very tranquil area with plenty of good places to eat.
Fun walk,"There is lots to see, eat, and drink. So many options for food. Lots of different types of stores to visit."
Always things to do and see on the River Walk.,Such a unique walking ( or boating) experience.  It was central to our hotel so we were on it every day .  With a good map you can get off anywhere to explore more of the city.
Pleasant and beautiful ,Loved it here. It’s beautiful and well done. I thought at first it would just be a tourist trap but I really was impressed!  Too many restaurants to count!
Fun and informative too!,"you must take the boat tour to see the river walk from a way you cannot do while walking. Then you get to chose the places you want to eat at later.Take your time, there is much to see and do."
Nice walk around,Great way to spend a sunny day walking around shopping or dining out. We found everything very enjoyable. A must see if your in the area.
"Beautifil atmosphere, gorgeous, relaxing and a great place to wander!","We visited the riverwalk on sunset. It was BEAUTIFUL! There are endless restaurants to choose from however we were too late to score a spot on the gondola dinner. We were blown away by the atmosphere and beautiful, relaxed feel of the riverwalk. Public toilets were hard to find and the ones we did find were locked :( So that cost us a couple of drinks to use restroom at a bar- happy to do, but public amenities would have allowed us to extend our 'wandering' ;)"
River Walk,"great walk, one level (once down on the river walk) can walk down steps or take an elevator. Lots of shops and restaurants along the river walk, with in or outdoor seating. Fun area to people watch, relax, have a margarita."
always my go to place,River walk is some what is back bone of San Antonio and my my always go to place .you like to have a light walk in the after noon with beautiful color full umbrellas along side this is your place and if want to have dazzling night with fun  and local music and his place is even better lots of dinning options and grats hotels to stay in
Great food and entwrtainment,We are here for a work event. Staying at the Hilton on the River Walk. Love this entire district area. Great food and fun entertainment.
Always fun...,Haven't been for a while so we went for a visit. They have made a lot of improvements since the last time we were there. Nice to just walk around and enjoy the scenery.
Lovely weekend,Wonderful except 1.31 thru 2.2 while they had some Chinese New Year boats flying past altogether too quickly in a hurry the lights in the trees weren’t on! Really nice overall for slow vacay season!
Restaurants mostly. ,Not for children in my opinion. Mostly restaurants.  Touristy but pretty. Is a bucket list item for me though. Be aware there are birds in trees everywhere on top side streets and river walk; and poop everywhere under the tree on sidewalk. Lots of homeless people lying around. Wouldn’t come in summer. Perfect time of year temp wise. Not crowded  at all. Stayed in Homewood suites on west market street. Was good location.
A beautiful place to spend some time,We enjoyed the Riverwalk on a lovely day. It's nice to wander in the stores and restaurants. There is a little something for everyone.
Food food and more food,"Mostly fun to eat, drink, ride the river boat, people watch, walk, enjoy weather, walk, enjoy warm weather, eat, and check out the architecture.  Very cool"
Beautiful ,My husband and I visited the end of January. The Riverwalk is beautiful and worth the walk. Many restaurants to choose from and felt very safe walking around the downtown streets of San Antonio.
Quick Stop or Several Hours...It's a Must See,"Need to find a good meal, quick drink, place to stay, or a place to sit a relax?  This is it.You can find about anything you'd like on the San Antonio River Walk.Take a look at the pictures, and you'll soon realize that any detailed description would quickly run out of room.  Just too much list.Absolutely worth the stop!"
