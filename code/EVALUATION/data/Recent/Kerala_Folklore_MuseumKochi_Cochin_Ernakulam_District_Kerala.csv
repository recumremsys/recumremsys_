Fascinating Local History Artifacts,We came across this gem purely by chance - having no plans on a lazy afternoon..  The museum is housed in an architecturally classic building of three floors wherein all the rooms and even the hallways are replete with numerous artifacts ranging from masks to ancient armaments.  A must see!!  …
Visiting for new memory making,This is very good and famous measueam and many thing wile will see there and take images for our good memories
Must-see gem in Kerala.,"You have to visit this place!  It is such a gem.  This museum houses the astonishing collection of a private collector, whose family now maintains and protects the collection.  The artwork and cultural heritage collected within this museum rival some of the best collections I've seen in the US and Europe.  This is truly a Smithsonian-level collection, and all local to Cochin, Kerala, and Indian history.  If you like artwork and want to see a good museum in India, this is one of the best!  Plus, the nicest staff work there.  Absolute must-see!!…"
"Awesome collection, must see","I visited this place with family, its amazing musuem and you need 90mts to go around. If you see form outside you will feel not needed to go but do go and see. They have amazing collection of artifacts."
Fantastic collection of ancient artifacts,"From outside it looks like a regular ancient villa, but inside you will find an excellent collection of artifacts from various time periods. It amazed us how this villa could host such a fantastic collection of items. This place is not very well suited for kids or elderly people or people with mobility issue.…"
Very Interesting and definitely worth a trip,"My visit here was with family and they are a child friendly place-staff are extremely helpful and nice. Just keep an eye on the kids as there are many small items all over which they could easily reach and grab. The collection displayed was simply amazing, and to learn that it was all from a private collector makes it an even more magical experience. The building itself has fantastic architecture and the beauty of the displayed items is something you would not want to miss. Take your time in viewing the displayed items as they are really unique. Definitely a place worth visiting."
A perfect insight to the Keralan way of life,An exploration through the history of Kerala.  A fascinating display of artefacts and information.  A very enjoyable visit.
A Museum of Passion,"Every visitor to Kochi or Fort Kochi should visit this Museum. Take your time! The building, a beauty in itself, is loaded with the most interesting pieces of art. The passion of the man who put this art collection together is noticeable allover. I am glad I read about him upon leaving. It explained the uniqueness of it all!"
Historical background knowledge,Been here during the noon time. Must visit if you are interested in knowing historical artefacts of south india. 3 floors. Wooden steps. Takes about 45mins for total tour. 100 rs entry fee. Visit this place if you stay at kochi for 1 day.
Nothing too magnificent and probably a bit overhyped,Our driver took us to this museum and they charged us nearly 500 since we were foreigners even though for Indians it costs even less than half. It is a collection of items (many repeated items of the same nature and placed at different places) that the Museum founder had collected from Kerala culture over the last 40 years or so. I think the only amazing part for me was to see the wooden roofs than anything else. It is very hot and can feel a bit claustrophobic inside because of lack of ventilation. Not something that I would recommend as high on the list.
A must see ,"You can not visit Kochin and miss this museum. First of all, the building is amazing: made of wood with sculpted ceilings, it has 3 floors divided by different eras. All the items are apparently from a private collector and they are all wonderful and incredibly interesting! This was an absolute joy to visit, make sure you have 1 hour at least to see it all."
Best  Folklore Museum,Kerala Folklore Museum is one of the best folklore museums I have ever visited. It presents the cultural as well as historical aspects of Kerala. The museum has a team of staff who can explain you everything in good English. Worth visiting!
The Best Event of our visit,"It says it all in the title. This is a wonderful collection representing the history, music, costume and culture with excellent explanations in English. From beautiful musical instruments and masks to pre-history burial jars; from amazing jewellery to ivory carvings; from huge, ancient carved cows that brought the hope of prosperity to farmers to 2000 year old tiny Buddha heads salvaged from river beds. I could go on. Just a tuk tuk ride away from the stalls of Fort Cochin across the bridge. Amongst all the great things we did here over 4 days, this was the best."
"Museum with potential, problem with crowd control","The museum is housed in a beautiful building, and has a large and varied collection of artefacts. It would provide a better experience if there is some curation. The museum may also be short-staffed as there was hardly anyone keeping an eye on all the visitors. We saw two Indian families who literally touched every single object on the first floor, also draping their arms around the exhibits to take photos. And the grandfather even put a little boy, about three years old, onto an elephant statue to have his photo taken! And he did that twice. It is a pity that the founder of the museum wishes to share his collection but the visitors do not care to help preserve it. A sad thing to watch.The interior design and architecture of the museum is very interesting as well. We may have enjoyed that more than all the numerous artefacts just piled together. I can see how it's a personal style, and maybe the focus is in the vast collection and not the curatorial eye. It's not bad for an overview of the regional culture, but not for a more in-depth knowledge."
A great place to visit for people who love art & history in one,"The museum is packed with so much to see. U will only find a small path cleared to walk through. It was mix of ancient and few mid times antiques for us to see. Based on crafts & Folk art, there is a variety of artifacts to get mesmerized. The architecture of this authentic Kerala style building keeps it in flavour. The building itself speaks on realistic wooden carpentry of Kerala. A must visit spot learn about the various ancient art forms of Kerala."
Too much in one place,We went there as it was part of our trip itinerary. It is recommended only for those who have keen interest in historical art collection 20000+ art effects collected by a private collector. Good collection of sarees to but from on reasonable price.
Crammed with items collected by one family,"Now housed in a beautiful building, this is a private collection carefully brought together and displayed.  Members of the family were around to answer questions and talk about the exhibits."
Brilliant history collection ,"The location of this place is directly outside Fort Kochi. It has a brilliant collection of items from different cities around India, Bengal and Kerala. You can learn more about the history of the objects and you can also visualise what they did with all of those items. Every item in this museum tells a story. The collection consists of paintings, animal decorations, wooden sculptures, toys, Christian art, lifestyle artefacts, utensils, tribal art, traditional oil lamps, masks, stone sculptures, jewellery, bronze sculptures, ancient terracotta, antique furnitures, antique collections and an antique jewellery box collection.You can also learn about the different cultures by looking at this collection.The promoters of this museum did an excellent job in keeping this place well maintained and in excellent condition.Anyone who loves history and culture should visit this place.I recommend this place to everyone."
Its all about history,If you are looking for history of kerala and south india then this is a place for you. This privately owned museum is well built and organised and has vast number of historical items which define the culture and history of kerala and south India.
Packed with amazing artefacts,"The museum is literally packed with all sorts of amazing artefacts. If you like museums and history, you must visit here!"
Amazing collection,"Just outside Fort Kochi, is this private collection of a family. Founded by George Thaliath and his wife Annie George, this museum has an unbelievable collection of artefacts and paintings from various parts of Kerala. George is no more but his wife and young son Jacob manages…"
A hidden treasure ,"This is an amazing place, not your usual museum, this is one mans collection and is family run. There are 3 floors crammed with incredible pieces of art and architecture, each more amazing than the first, and they have so many items in the collection that you can actually buy…"
A must visit!,This would have to be one of the best private museums I have come across.  The artefacts on display give a great insight into local history and the guide on hand was engaging with my family to bring many a story of the items to life.  Super cheap entry too.
Culture ,Hosts events and performance and has small display about local Kerala culture not exactly world class but informative 
Small and Beautiful ,"Kerala Folklore Museum, i just entered by seeing the board, from outside its just like a small temple, doesn't have a space like a museum. But they just surprised me inside. It is soo beatifull. Well maintained and i liked the kerala traditional Kathakali costume placed inside…"
Had one of the best time here,"One of the best personally curated museums I have ever seen. It has a huge collection of drsses, masks, ornaments, musical instruments of Kerala culture. Even kids in our team have enjoyed it. A must visit in Kochi."
Great visit to Kerala museum,Great place to visit to learn about Kerala history. it is 3 story building. Plean 2 hours for seeing all artifacts
Kerala Folklore Museum - Glimpses of Kerala Architectural Styles.,"Kerala Folklore Museum situated in Kochi reveals the ancient architectural styles of Kerala. You can find Malabar style of architecture in on ground floor, Kochi style on first floor and the ancient Travancore style on the second floor. The ceiling of the top floor theatre is…"
A great informative visit,It was a good place to start if you’re looking at local artefacts & history...the place is generally well taken of & informative. The washrooms are less desired but then it was a holiday when we went (more people than usual). A must see!!
Excellent.  One man's collection shown over 4 floors ,Was really interesting and varied.  So much to see. Think entrance fee was 200 rupees.  Have to oay to use camera.  On 4th floor there is a little cafe where a lovely lady made me a cup of tea.  Some items available to buy
A must see!,"Several floors full of exhibits and friendly staff happy to explain every piece. Come with  lot of time, there is much to see."
A Little Hidden Gem,We were kicking our heals waiting for our plane(s) back to the UK and our driver suggested we go to the Kerala Folklore Museum.  More in hope than expectation we agreed and what a great find!  As a foreigner entry was 200 rupees plus an extra 100 to take photos.  The place was…
Terrible & Pathetic Museum.,I visited in the month of Nov 2019.Entry Charges(100 Rs/Person)+ Photography Charges (100 Rs) which was mandatory.I mean who take charges of photography??? Entry charges still Ok.If you want click the photos you have to pay 100 Rs.. If you not a lover of antique stuff don't…
Lot of artifacts,It is a private museum wherein an individual has collected so many artifacts. He has good collection of them and many are on sale. But I found prices little high and many items you can find in Delhi. Can be visited once
A good museum with 10 to 20th century artefacts,"Entry fee is 100Rupees + another 100 for camera. A good museum which houses artefacts from 10 th century to 20th century and also jewellery from 2000 years to early 20th century. If you are in Kochi, do visit this private museum, they have done an excellent job!"
awesome collection!!,"During our recent visit to Kerala in November this year, we went to famous Kerala folklore museum in Kochi. it's a privately established and maintained museum so they charge, 200 rs per head for entry!! it's a three storied building made up mostly of wood.  Folklore Museum is a…"
Beautiful museum ,The museum is pretty beautiful and quite amazing also and a must see place to see and visit in Kochi 
Lots and lots of exhibits,This is an amazing place with thousands of exhibits. It is arranged on 3 floors and the top one has an amazing ceiling with intricate woodwork and murals all around. Some of the exhibits are not as old as you initially think. There a lot to see but it’s stacked up rather than…
A treasure trove of antiques,"Highly recommend stopping to have a look. Don’t expect an organised display, however it was fascinating to see the many bits that George had collected during his life.   There are over 20,000 artefacts within the museum and the building itself is an amazing piece of…"
Interesting museum / antiques shop,"A wonderful collection of Tamil and Keralan sculptures, art, masks, jewellery, costume, ornaments, statues, paintings, coins and other objects. The building is a beauty and the staff are really sweet. There’s a tiny cafe where you can have a cup of tea and admire some cases of…"
Really good,"This has to be one of the best"" cabinet"" museums in Kerala. One man's forty teat quest to encapsulate his culture in, predominantly, carving. Very little tat, mostly quality artefacts displayed in a quite haphazard way. This museum should be supported, go there."
Beautiful compact place !,"It's a compact place to have a glimpse of the traditions of Kerala with Three different dynasties, as well as a lot of antique artifacts to shop for. "
gateway to folklore,"No words to express, it is really  nice to click photos and enjoy the folklore experience, thrilling experience, some more to added in their collection"
Visit to the Kerala Folklore Museum,I discovered that museum yesterday and I spent a couple of hours there. It is a private Art collection dedicated to the South of India. It is what I call eclectic and an old type of Museology. I mean by that an incredible diverse collection but to many things in such a small…
Worth a visit!,This is outside mainstream Fort Kochi or indeed Cochin but it is absolutely worth a visit if you have an interest in the culture of not just Kochi but also India.  It is jam packed with all sorts of weird and wonderful items and I just loved it.  Fun place to wander though
3 floors of ancient Indian artifacts,"This is a museum of sorts but doesn’t really focus on anything specific, it’s a whole collection of anything from ancient India but there are thousands of items. It cost 200 rupees to enter (each) but an extra 100 if you want to take photos. It reminded me of The Greatest…"
saw much but didn’t learn much,like walking into a garage sale.  not much explained but i was told they were all for sale.  a few display items captured my attention but again no one was available to tell me their stories.  charging inr200 entrance and this encounter felt like an amateurish attempt of a…
Great collection but uninterested staff,"It’s a good curation, but difficult to grasp so much as no guides... I understand it is because it’s a private curation. Items are on sale as well but they wayyyyy too costly. Not value for money"
Amazing,The collection is superb. It's surprising to know that one man has collected all these antiques and is exhibiting it.  Worth visiting!!
A Must See!,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this museum. An amazing collection of historic artifacts from Kerala and other Southern Indian areas. As a privately owned museum, they have done an excellent job of displaying a diverse range of objects reflecting the rich heritage of this part of…"
A musa to see,"We, a spanish family, were in this wonderful museum some days ago and was an astonishing experience due to the huge number of items in display (also the house is wonderful). We were very lucky because we met the widow and the son of Mr. George who took their time to explain the…"
Amazing museum,"This museum has lot to offer to travellers and tourists. Very good artifacts and vintage place. This should be there in your bucket list when in Kochi, Kerala."
A must to see the Kerala Folklore Museum while in Kochi.,temple.   Our day trip in Kochi took us to the Kerala Folklore Museum . To our astonishment we found over a thousand years of culture preserved so perfectly in midst of the city. We were enchanted  by the collections in this three storied building and were ushered by…
Ancient History Museum,It's a very huge museum (3 storey) with many historic items preserved. You might take an hour or more to cover the entire place. The staff is very strict about the closing timings so better be here way before the closing time. There's a Saree shop inside which sells the…
Ok,Nothing much to wow as it is simply an museum type where the attendants will not even help you if you have any doubts. It's like a free walk through inside.
Just a collection of statues and pictures,"A good option to spend an hour or so, if you are not into history and sculpture. But if you are interested in history its a good place to spend quality tine. And learn more. Entry fee rs 100 per Peron and additional rs 100 for cameras which is not worth paying. Its a 2 storey…"
Interesting bits and pieces of history in a compact space,Amazing to see one man's effort in conserving the heritage. I would recommend to add it in a Kochi trip. The four storied building itself is quire impressive. Do not miss the ceiling at the top floor. Only wish they could allow free entry of cameras.
Interesting Museum!,We just reached on time to visit this museum in the evening.A very well kept place with artifacts etc from all over India. Its a private museum but collection of historical items is commendable. The structure & carvings in the building is also breath taking. The effort put in by…
Interesting,The building itself is unique and offers a nice look into the past. All of the artifacts inside certainly give a good idea of what was here long ago. You can get antiques and new junk at the museum if you like. Others complain about the 100 rupee price but the lady running the…
Not worth visiting,"This place is recommended by a taxi driver, and we felt disappointed. It’s just a massive collection, not organized at all, you can even feel like you’re visiting his warehouse. And the ticket is 200 per person, it’s not worthy."
museum,"The Kerala Folklore Museum is a  private museum located in pandit karuppan road , near Thevera ferry junction  must be one of the most understated attractions in Kochi. Located in Thevara, mainly related to the culture of Kerala."
Amazing Collection,"The Kerala Folklore Museum, privately managed, must be one of the most understated attractions in Kochi. Located in Thevara, you can easily miss seeing it unless you are looking for it. It has a vast treasure of items all collected by one family, mainly related to the culture of…"
Interesting & Educational visit,Really enjoyed visiting this museum. It was a good learning experience of the art and culture in Kerala and South India. All the artifacts were well maintained. Special thanks to our guide Ria for taking her time to walk with us while explaining every item that we passed by…
OKish,"Kerala Folklore Museum consists of a huge private collection of artefacts. Although there is no explanation, nor do there exist categories among the exhibits (the items are scattered around) there are some pretty interesting artefacts that reflect the Hindi civilisation.  A…"
You could spend all day looking at the amazing collection of artefacts,3 floors that showcase curios and artefacts of Kerala. The most spectacular collection - even has fossils and artefacts from BC eras.
Vacation ,Excellent collection of artefacts.  Large collection under one roof Can be given more space to distribute the artefacts. 
did not stop,Another place we did not stop on tour but flashed by and by the time we where told what is was it was a distant memory.  Very poor guide
A MUST see,Unbelievable collection on several floors. Helpful staff willing to explain. You can spend the whole day here and discover and admire.
Well managed museum,"If you are interested in historical museum, this is the perfect destination. Ancient paintings, vessels, clothes, handmade instruments, door designs, musical instruments all of this at one place. They are charging RS. 100 per person and extra charge for camera. Minimum time…"
Bad customer service,"Although it was a fairly good collection of items on three floors of the building , our experience was totally ruined by the dark fat lady at the counter who was rude and behaved as if the museum belonged to her.   Otherwise , there are a lot of items belonging to the last few…"
A must see.,What an amazing collection of around 25000 artefacts collected over many years by Mr George and his family. Unfortunately Mr George passed away recently but his wife and his son are fully in charge. Set on 3 floors in a beautiful building with amazing ceilings and wooden floors.…

This place needs more visitors,"Interesting collection of artefacts and ladies informative. The house is very interesting with its wooden and painted ceilings, steep stairway"
Good collection ,"This is a private collection converted to a museum. There are lot of good, interesting pieces. The display can be improved with a good curator. The staff is only present in the shops at the top level"
Awsome place for history enthusiasts,This place is a must go for history enthusiasts. They have got a huge collection of artefacts depicting the history of Kerala and it's city states. Some souvenirs are also available for sale here. The staff are really nice and have good level of knowledge about the items on…
Not worth the money and time,No significant attempt to present folklore of kerala in any authentic and cohesive way. Better save the money (Rs100 per person) and time.
A Treasure Trove,"This is well worth your support as this museum was born from the passion of a private collector with a love of local culture. We allowed a couple of hours and were held fascinated by the immense, diverse and comprehensive collection of art and artefacts of all ages and from all…"
Hard Sell ,What could have been a really interesting visit was spoiled by the curators hard selling the exhibits. 
Top notch museum,"Great museum , and given a lovely guided tour ... great place to visit ... caught the ferry from Fort Kochi to Ernakulam "
SWINDLE,"On our first trip to Kerala/Cochin our driver suggested this museum.  On entry were charged 200 rupees per person plus 100 rupees to use a camera therefore, for two people 500 rupees.  Immediately after entry we were approached by an attractive young lady asking ""where are you…"
Great little find,Our driver took us here and suggested we visit. This was during our Citrus Holidays tour of Kerala. No other driver took any of the other couples we met doing the same tour here although some passed it and saw the signage. This was quite surprising as it was actaully interesting…
Jam packed with historical stuff,"Such a cool, interesting Museum. Jam packed with artifacts, art, masks, pottery, carvings, dolls, furniture, statues etc Lots to take in, lots to take pics of. Guides were very informative. Have to go barefeet, so it would be nice if the floors were spotless."
House of history and culture,"Was not overly impressed with most of the museums we saw in Kochi, but this was a pleasant exception.  The building was jam packed with artifacts that brought much of the history and culture we heard about to life.  The first floor hostess did a marvelous job explaining the…"
A fascinating collection that's well worth a visit,"We'd had the folklore museum recommended during our stay in Kochi - it's outside Fort Kochi if you stay there but well worth a visit. 20,000 items on display over three floors, organised by different areas of Kerala and even the room furnishings are exhibits including a 63 tonne…"
This is a ‘must-see’ museum and please leave enough time...,While we were enjoying the sounds and sights in Kochi in December our driver had suggested three times that we should visit the Kerala Folklore Museum in Kochi. My wife and I were not too interested as first the name wasn’t too impressive and we wanted to see so many other “more…
absolutely amazing,this is such an amazing collection. Full credit to the owners.  Do not miss miss this cultural site. 10/10 for me .... loved the experience
Tour of Kochi,An amazing collection of relics amassed by one man over a 40 year period. Displayed over 3 floors. Not too crowded.
Wonderful Mueseum,Fantastic insight to Kerala’s rich history. We definitely enjoyed the visit and were very flattered by the hospitality. My parents and my wife were visiting from the states. This is located near my dad’s hometown and he was very impressed.   This is a must do if you are visiting…
"Large collection of South Indian cultural objects, well displayed",Very good collection and very large; good to spend couple of hours or more and see and understand even a small number of them.  The guides are helpful.
Private museum ,"Private museum with a very good collection of temple artifacts and other antique items, set in a beautiful building. "
Lovely Museum,"Lovely museum displaying lots of artifacts related to the history of daily living of various people from Kerala that should not be missed. The wooden panels,very well kept wooden staircase and beautifully carved ceilings are amazing."
Traditional Kerala art and culture,Very well organize and painstakingly done museum made by a family. There are very interesting artifacts collected fro all over Kerala.
The best museum we've seen in Cochi,"Lots of museums have lots of space, and too little to exhibit; here, the available space is barely sufficient to accommodate the wealth of artefacts. The building itself is part of the exhibit, and architectural details, carvings, statues, temple implements, clothes, Christian,…"
RICH HERITAGE OF KERALA,"This place is packed to the brim with historical artifacts. Its a private museum situated in Thevara, right in front of KEYS SELECT HOTEL.  A wonderful place to visit once.  Entry Fee - Rs. 100 per person Additional Rs. 100/- for photography"
Great place,"Great place. Choc a bloc with artefacts, well maintained, very neat and clean. The wooden building itself is extremely interesting. Over priced, but being a private institution maybe required. Worth a visit."
Great Antique collection!!,"The entrance fees is Rs.100 per person and for clicking photos its and additional Rs.100! The Folklore Museum at the entrance feels small but once you enter it is vast and takes time to explore! The museum has good collection of antiques like old coins,artifacts,wooden…"
Wonderful eclectic collection,"An almost bewildering private collection of (in the main) high end cultural artefacts from musical instruments to Theyyam masks and costumes to oil paintings to puppets to antique Keralan front doors, well displayed and maintained over 3 floors in a glorious traditional Keralan…"
Wonderful,This was not on our itinerary but we were delighted our driver suggested stopping. A huge private collection very well displayed and interesting in a fascinating building with amazing woodwork. Strongly recommend a visit
Ahaha,"Sorry to say I found a bunch of old dusty nonsense things, I don't think it should be a museum especially because the aim is to make you buy a few old stupid souvenirs at the second floor. Very disappointing... "
Great display and explanation of culture,"Packed full of exhibits in a building made with with wonderful ceilings from long demolished houses, the highlight was the explanation by the curators. Ria was so knowledgeable in good English that the culture came alive."
Just Another Museum,"Artifacts of three styles - Malabar, Portuguese, and Travancore.Interested in learning a little about Kerela? then its a must visit!"
Good Museum - Private Collection,"Though there are amazing Articrafts displayed here, it is basicaly what looks like a private collection. Our driver took us to this place as one of the attractions in Kochi. Entry fees was Rs 100 plus Rs 100 if one wants to take photographs, just a bit too much though It certainly has an impressive collection of artifacts by a private collectorKerala Folklore Museum has various antiques that showcase the history, tradition and culture. There are costumes of dance forms like Mohiniattam and Theyyam, antique properties,Old writings instruments, antique chairs etc.This museum houses a priceless collection of artefacts and covers three architectural styles: Malabar, Kochi/Portuguese and Travancore across three floors.Ground,1st & 2nd)"
Excellent Museum,"A wonderful collection of traditional items and artefacts beautifully displayed in a fantastic timber building. So many things to see on three floors.Excellent, helpful and very knowledgeable staff to answer any questions.A must see if visiting Kochi."

"A heritage museum, every inch of space tells a story","This lovely artefact- rich museum housed in a traditional Kerala building is the labour of love of one man George J Thaliath and his desire to share the wealth of the culture and heritage of Kerala. Lovingly set up, well documented and supported by an extremely courteous and…"
An amazing place ,So nice to see this private collection. Kudos to the family who does this. Kerala has a lot of history and talent and so proud to see this initiative showcasing our rich art and cultural heritage.
Wonderful museum with Kathakali performance,"Our OAT guide Suresh made sure we got to see an authentic Kathakali performance, a dance drama with colorful and exotic costuming and music. Try just visiting the center and museum and ask to see a performance.  My guess is you will save plenty on the performance by not booking…"
Amazing Collection ,Its really worth a visit to this museum. Collections are amazing.Very well maintained stuff .A person who is keen to know the history of Kerala would definitely enjoy this .
Has a breathtaking collection from different cultures in Kerala,"Three floors each dedicated to a different aspect of Kerala culture, also has a café and shop included."
Amazing museum in Kochi,"This Unique museum is the best example of traditional Kerala architecture. The structure is made of wood, laterite stone and clay tiles.

excellent,go and gain knowledge  it is useful to ours so friends please visit once miseum in your life.....😲😲
Very Average,"Our driver took us to this place as it is supposed to be a good place to visit, while in Kochi. Entry fees was Rs 100 plus Rs 100 if one wants to take photographs. Not worth it at all. No credit cards and only cash is taken.   It is like somebody has collected some old artefacts…"
Wonderful Visit,"This is an interesting museum..which kids n elders both would enjoy. Not very big but its maintained well and gives a glimpse on the history...There are 3 floors in all. There are stores inside selling imitation jewellery, sarees and artefacts."
surprisingly good,"Seen almost by accident, lots of artifacts from all over and some are even for sale on one of the upper floors."
Beautiful,"Beautiful to look at from the outside and well maintained inside. There is an entry fee of Rs 100 per person and another 100 if you would want to take pics. Lots of stuff to see- wood and metal sculptures, paintings, ceramics and pottery, coins...list goes on.Its a privately owned and maintained collection. You could easily spend a few hours there. Definitely worth a visit"
Unbelievable...must visit,"It's been a revelation to me. Never thought one man's passion to collect and exhibit art can turn out to be so beautifully manifested. It's a huge treasure and at ridiculously low entry ticket. Authentic traditional collection all under one roof.If there's one ""must visit"" museum in Kerala it is this. Meticulously maintained spotlessly clean it's a treat. If there's one flaw that is too many in too little space. Fund constraints may be  restricting the owners from expansion.Interested in art culture tradition or history this is the place"
What a suprise,Situated right next to our hotel we spent two lovely hour browsing through the museum. So much to see what an amazing collection. The staff where helpful and informative. A delightful stroll in the history of Indian artefacts and other eclectic stuff. The building is also fabulous.

Don't miss this amazing collection,"We stopped at the Kerala Folklore Museum on the way to the airport on the last day of our trip to Kerala.  We are so glad we did.  The building is a composite of dozens of historic structures and is beautiful to see itself.  The collection of objects is amazing, organized by the…"
Impressive building and collection,What a great place! The collector has spent over 30 years gathering the artefacts inside and the building has even been made with parts of 25 other heritage buildings to make this the beautiful wonder it is today. A notice offers apologies for this not being a museum full of…
Amazing Museum!,I loved visiting this museum while in India. There is soooo much stuff here. So much history and culture! Entrance fee is totally worth it!

Many interesting artifacts,An impressive collection of artifacts by a private collector. This is a highly recommended visit for history buffs. There are items from the various religious communities and cultures in the area.
Amazing place to visit.,Full of antique and historical crafts and products. Unique collections and  it says a lot about history. Amazing experience.
Amazing private collection.

The museum itself is extraordinary 3 story building lined with hardwoods and very nicely architected. Overall highly…"
Beautiful collection of artefacts ,"We reached the museus by taxi, but I believe it will be easy to get there by bus or bicycle.  We left the shoes at the entry and there is a free entry and another fee for pictures.  Beautiful collection inside and staff and very informative.  Beware you will need to climb…"
A must visit in Kochi if you are interested in history and artefacts,"The staff were outstanding and very helpful in every way.

The bottom floor is dedicated to the northern part of Kerala (Malabar), the next floor up is dedicated to Kochi (the central…"
Intersting and overwhelming,"A bit off the beaten path in Kochi, you will find the Kerala Folklore Museum, which houses the collection of a single individual on three floors. The artifacts are displayed in an organized chaos and represent the incredible richness of (mostly) South Indian culture. The…"
crazy colourful collection,Some really interesting artefacts with informative guides. They do however push you to buy things. Worth a visit - a bit like a crazy car boot sale.
Ancient artefacts,"Could be visited if you are a history buff. Lots of things like Kerela's ancient jewellery, wooden carved items are placed here."
Informative,Kerala Folklore Museum is quite informative. Good place to visit with kids to understand the cultural aspects.
Intense Experience ,It is a nice museum with a huge collection of artifacts. I recommend reading about it before going to appreciate the museum.
Must visit Kerala...,Kerala folklore is an excellent folk museum showcasing the local keralian culture. There are many historical monuments to display the rich heritage of kerilian culture
Worth the visit,Though a bit out of Tourist area but museum was worth a visit. Good collection of Kerala history. Top auditorium with mural painting are really beautiful.
Good place,It was a good experience and the museum visit was worthwhile. There we saw a good collection of local ethnic things of Kerala
Great Collection of Artifacts,"It as not a planned visit, kind of popped in to check what it is about. Was delighted to see the Artifacts collection here. Happened to speak to one of the partners of this place-Mrs George if I am not mistaken, she explained their 30 years journey of collating these Antique…"
Had a good experience  but the thungs you try to sell are not worthy,I really had a good experience in watching old things and paintings but soveniors were not worth of cost... Please dont try to make fool of your guests 
Interesting museum ,Nice collection of old artifats which alone do not make a story but come to live buy the guide whose enthusam for the collection and the way he tells the tale made it an interesting visit.
A labour of love by the owners,This family owned museum has been built up over many years and showcases a massive variety of Kerala artefacts. The themes for each floor are slightly lost by the sheer volume of material on display but a great insight into the area's background and culture.
.,Very interesting place with historic items and intelligent informative staff. My wife did purchase a couple of items to help the life of the museum.
Sooo many things to look at,There are several floors full of history and so many things to look at. It's hot in the museum and there are almost too many things to look at. Not at the things are in english.
Must visit,The artifacts on display are simply great. The guide explained in detail about each artifact. Must visit if interested in the history of Kerala
Well worth the visit,Tracing the three cultures that combined to produce what we now see as Kerala. An amazing array of artefacts painstakingly assembled and displayed this is worth taking time to view. They receive no official funding so need as many   visitors as possible.
Nice collections and displays.,The place has a vast number and variety of collections. The collections are very nice and has a rich history. The interior of the place is also very beautiful and suits the collections. There are gift shops inside as well.
Wasnot great,"They have a good collection . But not placed in very interactive or interesting way . I expected more from here. I would have preferred they have a lift , walkie talkie to explain or small movie as introduction to know more about the musuem. With my kid she was bored , usually…"
So much to see!,"Well, I would like to say that you should spend a half a day in here at least but the heat might consume you. First of all, it is a phenomenal museum. It is a collection of items by a family with no order, rhyme or reason to them. Everything you can imagine and can't imagine is…"
Museum,"Traditional building, excellent display of traditions including woodwork, well maintained, helping staff."
Amazing - Dont miss,"The artifacts on display is simply great. Was told that one person has collected all these huge number of artifacts, displayed in three stories of the building. The guide explained in detail about each artifact. Must visit if interested in history of the South India."
"Amazing, Simply Amazing",I visited the Kerala Folklore Museum today and all I can say is 'Amazing'.  I was awed by the amount of artifacts that are on display at this museum plus the number of staff who are on hand to give a summary of each floor and to answer any questions.  Even the owner helped to…
Not your usual museum,"Was expecting exhibits behind glass and something quite formal...Oh what a surprise. It was like an ""Aladdins cave"" of artefacts all grouped together on 3 floors. Very little was behind glass as it was open to view behind unobtrusive barriers. The staff were friendly and…"

good place to visit,it is a small museum of the king who lived and a must see place. shows a way of ancient life that too this part of life and how it was difficult
Wonderful gem,We loved this museum. Yes it was jammed pack with relics and no there wasn’t detailed descriptions but it was filled with unusual items that told a story of a people.   It isn’t like a traditional museum.  There are some magnificent pieces and ones you might not see elsewhere. …
Extremely rewarding museum,Very welcoming and helpful staff. This place is stuffed to capacity with ancient artifacts. Well worth a visit.
The history of kerala well maintained ,"The three storey building with just the wooden support. This includes the old well maintained sculptures artifacts. The welcome style is excellent.

Folklore,"Its a small museum takes about an hour or so, it has a collection from around the world, pleasant enough"
Wonderful collection of Indian cultural artefacts,"Getting there: Its only about 5 - 10 minutes by car / taxi towards Thevara from Kundanoor junction (on NH 66). As far as I understand, there is no regular bus service on this route.  Museum houses plenty of artefacts ranging from burial urns (1000 BC) , idols, musical…"
Very large collection .. Only the selling attempts take one point,I have never seen a private museum with such a diverse and large collection. Entry fee is 200 INR and to take photos is another 100 INR. The museum has multiple floors and shows artifacts that are more than 2000 years old all the way to more recent centuries.  The staff is…
Amazing museum and an essential visit,This is one of the most incredible places we have ever been- it is a vast collection of Indian artifacts collected by a single private collector who has unselfishly built this museum so that the general public can benefit. It is run largely by his beautiful family and the entry…

It reminded me very much of Kelkar Museum in my city of…
Good Museum,Very traditional and religious things of South India are exhibited here.  Place is clean and good.  Very informative for the children and also adults.  I would recommend others to visit this museum to gain knowledge about our culture and religions of our country.
Good,"Though there is a lot of beautiful art work at display here but after a while it becomes tiring, specially for people taking kerala tour and spending half a day at Kochi.  Additionally the ticket prices I thought must be reviewed and they should consider having a group discount…"
Must see,"I appreciate the effort put to collect and preserve the artifacts/antiques, indeed they have a good collections. This place needs good support from people and government.  Thanks Ramesh KJ"
The visit to this museum was our favorite experience in Kochi.  We expected to spend 1 hour and spent over 2!,"The collection of artifacts is impressive!

They are nicely displayed, the staff does a great job and guiding you through, explaining and answering quetions.  Of all the museums I…"
A must,Worth a visit if not included in your agenda. Lot of things to see and cherish. This was part of our guided tour and glad we made it here
Very nice collection and well presented ,We visited the museum on 22/10/17.  The museum building itself has the antique feel and is appropriate for the display of such artefacts. The display is mostly related to culture of kerela in the earlier centuries. But it is worth the visit though entry charge is Rs 100/- per…
Wonderful,Amazing place with air conditioning. The museum is packed full of wonderful interesting pieces. The display is over three floors with many pieces for sale.  Allow a couple of hours to try to see everything. 
Amazing collection of artefacts,"The exhibits (10,00 in all) extend over three levels in this traditional style building.  There are remnants of pottery that are 4,000 years old and large complete burial pots 3,000 years old.  The display of colourful  dance costumes on the upper floor is impressive.  They used…"
Excellent experience... not to be missed,I have been to multiple museums the world over.. and always felt we could do so much more in India... After seeing the really well curated collection at the folklore museum... I should say it would really grow to be a great museum showcasing the best of Kerala and India.  Really…
Absolute gem!,"This is an overstuffed, eclectic display of all thing Keralan. So much to see and marvel at and not at all stuffy or worthy just a joyous mass of weird and wonderful stuff. We had a lot of items explained to us by a lovely young guide and everyone was welcoming. Can not…"
Very good collection of Cultural and historical artifact.,"This museum is a good place to visit if you're interested in history and culture. It consists of the artifacts from as old as before 8th century AD. It consists of different stone statues, traditional musical instruments, doors, weapons, cooking vessels (big) etc. It is 3 storey building with different sections . The look is very good and along the staircase , there are various paintings from different famous painting schools including Raja ravi varma school.

They have a section featuring different attires, props for classical dance methods as kathakalli etc. There are masks , jewllery used for it and information about it. Entrance fees is INR 100 per person and if you wish to take photographs, there is an additional INR 100  fees."
Let's bring back tradition ,A very good collection of 5000+ artefacts from various places of south India including my native Chettinad. One family of antique collectors preserving so many artefacts is simply amazing and hats off to Mr. George and his family. I had a short interaction with his son Mr.Jacob George and understood their passion to bring back tradition and preserving our culture. I think government should provide financial aid for such noble cause. Let's bring back our tradition.
Interesting and nice visit,This place has an impressive array of historic things that are displayed. Unfortunately the displays are very crammed and dusty and could be maintained better. Its though a non government supported location and the entrance fees and donations go towards the preservation of this place.
Fascinating folklore muesum.,"It is so fascinating,interesting muesum ..One can't miss this if you are interested to know abt art&culture of southern states...Kerala in particular.Staff is v.co.operative,ever ready to clear our queries.what ever we see here are collected by a single person,from last 30 yrs..

Exploring Kochi,A really interesting museum- well worth the visit. The guide was very knowledgable and we learned a lot about Keralan  artefacts
A trip through our history,Folklore museum is a small old palace like place a huge art effects and sculptures within telling bus stories of past. It a places which holds a lot in very less. From the existence of man kind to the evolution of culture and dance forms.  From the famous snake boats to the…
Private Museum,This is privately owned museum.  There are some decent artefacts in the museum but donot expect what the govt owned museum has. The fist and second floor has artefacts too. There are sales counters and you can buy (at your dicretion) some vintage stuff (if you can identify).…
Great Little Museum!,"Great Little Museum with great collections -- filled with so many collections inside! If only they could get a bigger building to accommodate all collections inside, that would be great! However, the building itself is already a nice place to visit. Love most of the collections…"
Impressive collection in beautiful building,The museum was my favorite thing to see in Kochi.  The museum building is beautiful; inside it impressively showcases three Kerala architectural styles--a different style on each floor. The detailed carvings on the ceiling are very lovely.   I loved the puppets and showcase of…
My most memorable experience of Cochin,"Kerela folklore museum is not to be missed if you want to see how much a private collector can do to preserve the heritage of his Homeland.  Around 10,000 articles on exhibit with very friendly staff who explain the relics.  My favorite was the ancient musical instruments. A…"
good place to understand history of Kerala,We started our visit to Kerala at the museum and it introduced us to the culture of the South.A guide took us round and she was very informative and helpful.For a first overview of the Country it is worth a visit has it explains a lot of other things you will encounter during…

Kerela Folklore Museum,"This is a cultural delight, steeped in history and is a great place to visit.  The owners are very proud to preserve its heritage and I would definitely recommend."
Pressurised sales tactics,"A young girl guided us round the ground floor, she was very informative and there were some very interesting things. However once we got to the next floor the hard sell began. As well as the usual souvenirs some of the artefacts were for sale and staff were very persistent in…"
Wonderful,"The museum building itself looks like a Buddhist pagoda. It is primarily made of wood and looks stunning. The artefacts, paintings, coins, weapons, old manuscripts all are excellent and if you are interested in history then you can spend atleast half a day in the museum. The…"
Fascinating.,An enormous private collection of Indian and local artefacts displayed over several floors. Take your time as there is so much to see. No inside photography allowed.
old artefacts,it is a nice place for the people who love old artefacts and history. if you love to learn about the ancient period and about hindu mythology do vist here. otherwise it should be avoided.  nice staff and well maintained museum
"centuries old art pieces, figurines, paintings","Set on three floors,each dedicated to North, Mid & south Kerala nuances of art & architecture, this single-man's collection of over 30 years is a treat & a peep into Kerala's history. A must-see place,a s the guides are good. Mementos are also available and collection goes…"
A fleeting visit on our way back to the airport,Not mentioned by our tour company it was by chance our driver took us here to while away some time on our last day before travelling to the airport.   What a treasure!  Artefacts from all cultures crammed in together - it would have been possible to spend hours here.  Also there…
A hidden jewel.,"Would not usually be my cup of tea, but this place is a treasure trove of South Indian culture, just wish we had had more time to spend there."
Nice place but museums are boring.,"Nice place but museums are boring........ Anyways, architecture is good....... feels ok to visit this place as one time........"
Lots of history ,It's so crowded with historical items I never seen so much in a museum the building is new built with old design but it's small for such big no of items 
Simply Awesome!,"This is an awesome introduction to Keralan culture & traditions. A huge amount of collections, you’ll be amazed at the sheer number of ornaments there are! "
Crammed,... this place is crammed with artefacts .. not always well labelled... but some fun things ... it was very hot although the outside temperatures was not ... so beware in the height of the hot season !! We were there less than an hour 
The real history of kerala,"The kerala folklore museum gives a window of our past and the great achievements of the state in terms of art and history. Calm and peacful place, great to visit to take a break off te busy city life."
A gem,"Fascinating collection of art and artifacts from Kerala. A relatively small building, but with so much to see, and the staff are so enthusiastic to explain and inform. It’s possible to buy authentic items, both old and new, which are sold to raise funds for the museum."
Good collection of bizarre items,"This museum is based on a collection of items acquired by one family. It is more a group of relics and art than a museum of Keralan folklore. It does have an area on Kathakali dances however. An interesting place to break a journey, but don't expect to learn much from your visit"
"Museum of traditional local architecture as well as crafts, folk art & antiques, with a cafe & shop.","its a museum where we can find a collection of local traditional architecture not much busy place silent and peaceful, if u plan to go should spent time to know the construction of the architecture displayed there its awesome"
Worth the visit ,Entrance fees is 200 rupees and 100 to take pictures. This comes with a guide. Kerala Silk sarees are sold here for a very cheap price 2000 and 2150 rupees. You get to see/experience Keralas history and culture. 
Well worth a visit,Tuk tuk drive away and well worth the history lesson that is available as one goes around. May be worth getting a guide though although some of their English can be tough to understand.
Very interesting,This museum was visited by Charles and Camilla apparently and i can see why it would have been on their itinerary. Stuffed full of interesting artefacts and wonderful ceilings. Lots of religious items.
Real experience,"See the full Indian dance make up first and then the main dance event all the traditions of century's, great experience."
A must visit in Kerala,"This visit was one of the most interesting and important visits in Kerala - of all the museum's, galleries, Chinese fishing nets and other sigthseeing targets, was this the place were I got a feeling of the Indian culture, with its mix of religion, culture and beliefs.  Also,…"
Beautiful museum in Kochi,"First thing you notice about this museum is its building. It is really good looking giving the vibes of olden days' Portuguese, Dutch and Keralian mix architecture. The ticket is costs around Rs 100/- which is costly in terms of museum. It has a good collection of all types of…"
"first class experience with the old age equipments,instruments and so on","none of its kind in ernakulam,a mind boggling journey to the recent past,awful experience,ambience,shops ok."
Fabulous collection,"The most enormous selection of Kerala artifacts. Utterly fascinating, two hours well spent. Tuktuk from the ferry and 300R entry including camera fee. Complete bargain."
Lovely museum ,"I visited this museum around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was quiet. It was 300INR to enter including the use of cameras. This translates to about £3 so it was a bargain! The museum was absolutely packed of fascinating history! The staff were incredibly helpful, very kind and…"
Kerala Folklore Museum,Kerala Folklore Museum in thevara a good place to know about ancient folk dance and dresses . a 3 floor museum well maintained

Well..if you have spare time..,"Instead of waiting at airport, I chose to spend time here. Three story museum, private collection of articles from mostly 18th and 19th century. 100 per person ticket. Appears to be tourists trap."
an amazing house!,"The building is made of wood entirely, so you ought to be careful walking through especially the stairs. YOu get to see soo many things displayed of historical value. But sadly the organization isn't that good as much of it is crowded with items. But it was good and worth a…"
So many wonderful things,"This is a great place - a sanctuary away from the bustling streets of Kochi.  A really interesting collection of artefacts from many ages (11th century to the present day) fro, I believe, a local collector (and only opened in 2009).  What I liked about it was the intimacy of…"
Tourist trap,Privately owned. All tour operators want to take you there as they get commissions. Save yourself the effort 
Quirky and Cluttered,This three story museum would be enhanced with a declutter and professional labeling of exhibits. It was very interesting but did not flow. 
An idiosyncratic collection of traditional folk art and costumes,"A very large collection of South Indian folk art, confusingly arranged and displayed, with almost no signage.  Nonetheless there is much here to be enjoyed and appreciated for quality of workmanship.  Some of the exhibited pieces may be purchased."
What a collection,"There are 10,000 exhibits stuffed into a 3 storey house that belonged to a private collector. It only costs 200 rupee to go in and you won,t be disappointed. There is a gift shop but no pressure and there is a toilet. Prince Charles is one of the sponsors and the museum has no…"
"Beautiful artifacts, but don’t touch my hair",A note to the management: please tell your staff members not to touch people’s hair. This happened to me when I visited. I found it very rude.
A Brilliant Start to Our Kerala Tour,"If you are starting your Kerala tour from Kochi then you should not miss this museum.

Pleasant surprise,"Spent one hour in this 3-floor museum, originally designed as a theatre for dance performances. The building itself is worth the visit: magnificent wood structure with stunning carved details.  The space is packed with an assortment of interesting artifacts, a n excellent…"
Good collection of antiques,"Is bigger than it looks. Has 3 floors in total. Privately run museum with lots of antiques . Kudos to the curator for the variety of collection here. Maintained well . Lot of temple pieces, idols, furniture, urns and what not."
A maze of interesting artifacts,Worth a visit but it is a little claustrophobic with steep stairs serving 3 floors. Outside it was 32 degrees and it became stifling in some of the narrow passages.There are a.c. units on some floors. There is some amazing stuff to look at so do go.
Beautiful but not informative ,"Gorgeous, extensive collection of every important historical artifact under the sun. Although almost everything is labeled, there is no information about it's history/use/origin/context. Lovely place, helps to do your own research about kerela beforehand! "
Wonderful place,How can there be so much in one small building. If you only go to one tourist sight this is It. We took a taxi. It toik some time to get there from the ferry but worth the effort. The ladies working there gave information in a nice way. Some of them students. 
Amazing Museum with artefacts many centuries old ,"It was amazing to be in a museum loaded with artefacts and relics many many centuries old.Due to the vast collection, space appears overloaded,needs patient walk,and every step will offer atleast 5-10 artefacts to see,read and experience.   Saw a pair of metal Boomerangs from…"

You can also purchase few things from their but i felt they are little overpriced. This…"
Good collection ,Kerala Folklore Museum is one of the well maintained museum i have ever seen. A very good range of collection one could see here. But many of the items collected were repetitive. The museum needs to have a good arrangement for the ventilation. They charge high for entry with…
Kerala Folklore Museum,This place is very informative. It sheds a lot of information about art and folk of ancioent kerala.
Beautifully organized and wonderful artifacts.,"The museum building itself reflects Dravidian style and the wood sculptures are amazing. though few of them are deteriorated with the affect of time. Lot of sculptures, paintings , artifacts and neatly organized."
So much of History,This is a private museum. Hats of to the founder of this place. So much of history in one place. Government should help generously to preserve this beautiful museum.We really like place. Entry fee is on the higher side. The place can be made affordable to general public with the…
Window to Kerala’s culture and heritage ,It was probably the most interesting and informative place I visited in Cochin. I went discovering the past centuries of art and folk history!

A most interesting visit with a superb private collection,In a splendid wooden house which contains an enormous private collection of around 4000 artifacts.

Intense history,"To get a better understanding of the life, culture and history of Karelia, a visit to this museum is a must. At a cost of Rs 150, you get to visit the art gallery which is housed in four galleries. Then there is the doll museum which depicts the dressing of the various places in…"
Excellent collection ,A must visit if in Kochi. This place is crowded with artefacts and historical treasures from Kerala. It is almost a curiosity shop or antique gallery. Well worth a visit.
Most helpful and friendly staff,"The museum contains many interesting artefacts and it is placed in a very beautiful building. The staff were very informative and helpful, especially lady called Maria and her colleagues who helped us to organize a taxi. Thank you for your kindness and friendliness."
amazing,"This museum has comparatively a very expensive entrance fee, but the collection inside is so rich it is quite astonishing. The amassed folk art, the puppets, masks, gods, ceramics, furniture, lamps, altars etc. is speaks for such immense riches of human imagination and the…"
Awesome place out of the blue!,Everything seemed atleast 200-300 yrs old...with some things dating back to more than 1000 years..grm of a place must visit!
Cluttered collection in a three story wooden house,"I really like Kerala style wooden houses, and this recently remade three story house is a nice setting for this tight collection of thousands of items spamming centuries. I enjoyed the wall paintings, prayer books, and household items mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries"
Absolutely amazing collection ,I was totally overwhelmed by the amount of items the founder of this private museum collected. So much history under one roof - with one wooden ceiling weighing more than 30tons! A must see.  
Amazing collection in amazing building,"Three floors, packed with artifacts from southern India, in a beautiful building.  We spent about an hour here and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is true that the objects do not have detailed explanations, but they are beautiful to look at, and most of the objects have dates and…"
Lot of antiques... But not maintained well,The place has a very big collection...  But it is just dumped in a very small place.  The entry per person is 100 but there is no air conditioning or fans in the ground floor rooms...  Difficult to breathe also in the hot weather of kochi.  If you have small kids the place can…
Simply amazing!,"I was so glad we visited this museum. Not only is it chock full of some incredible antiques, and items of Keralan culture, but the entire place has been built with dedicated attention to the various old building styles of Kerala.  There was so much to see, that we only covered…"

A must visit," Museum with the great Indian artistic display.  Also, have a souvenir store inside with very reasonable priced stuff"
A must see while in Cochin and Kerala,"This rich collection draws one into the spirituality of Indian and Kerala people in ways far more intimate and compelling than vast, imposing cathedrals, like Notre Dame.  Every person in my group who visited expressed gratitude at the opportunity to explore this wonderful gift.…"
Amazing collection,"Amazing collection of historical treasure of in and around Kerala. essentially 3 floor and each floor has various collection of historical items be it tradition, art and culture. mesmerizing, can take easily 1-2 hrs.

Amazing place - a must see,"Not only is the building beautiful, the gates are striking but the real treasures are inside and lots of them.

Unexpected pleasure,"This was not on our itinery but gratitude to our driver for suggesting it after a disappointing trek to the government controlled, dilapidated Hill Palace and Dutch museum earlier. We were overwhelmed with the collection of artifacts and hats off to the passion of this family…"
Interesting in Every Way,Very interesting for both architectural style of the building itself and the various collections inside.  I look forward to going there again.
Kochi's Treasure,This place is an absolute find and truly off the radar. We would have missed it totally if not for our driver who knew us enough to bring us here. If you are remotely interested in India's history and past make this place a must visit. This 3-storey building is filled to the…
Incredible collection ,"This was the most overwhelming collection of South Indian artifacts we had seen up to this point of our three week trip. The building itself is quite something, with multiple floors and fun to explore. There is a lot to see without much context or available information on…"
It is a surprise in store,Must visit place for people who have a thing for history and old world. It is commendable that for a man and his family members have been collecting all these vintage work over decades to set up this museum. 
Wow,It is in thevara near M G road.Need to appreciate the person who done this effort to collect these item from different corner of the world. They gave  detailed description of each item . Very difficult to explain about the experience. You should vicit this at least once in your…
A Gem of a Find,A local person recommend this museum to me. It is full of artefacts which were collected over many years by one person.  It cost 200 rupees plus a ticket for taking photos. Well worth a visit. Please note as usual you have to leave your shoes outside. There are also 3 flights of…
A Gem,"Considering that the Museum's collection is private, my family was astounded by its breadth and depth. It feels like a large museum has been packed with considerable forethought toward display and design into a temple. I can not help but feel that I could have easily spent…"
Beautiful Folklore Museum,"This is a great place to visit if you are in or near Cochin. It's a beautiful old wooden structure, packed full (almost too full!) of an eclectic collection of crafts, furniture, dance costumes and memorabilia from Kerala and other south Indian states. A real treasure trove, not…"
"Amazing building, amazing cultural artefacts collection",In a compact building are many objects giving a good sense of the history and culture of Kerala and other regions. Helpful labelling of categories of items. Delightful and helpful guides. Easy bus ride from Fort.
A 30 mins break for the journey and a great short insight,Well worth the small entrance fee if passing to see some amazing local history and culture. There is just so much to see.
Very well maintained,"Though we did not have much time, However, the museum has a lot of artifacts & is very well maintained."
good collection - not much guidance,"the museum is lovely, and has a great collection of items.  there are some descriptions around the objects, but there isn't a comprehensive structure or a storyline around which the objects and displays are arranged.   It just feels like a bunch of interesting stuff been piled…"
"Private collection, well maintained","Don't expect a typical museum. There are cupboards of coins and palm frond texts that seem like a display of curios in a home, but at the same time, there are larger pieces with more information than some government museums provide. The design of the home built exclusively to…"
Ancient Indian Culture....,"This Museum makes history books come live.This museum consists of various sculptures, ornaments, coins, toys, faces, dance costumes, weapons, vessels and other items used by kings. Museum also has shops inside which sell gift items and clothes. Entry ticket can seem a bit…"
A great experience ,"We very much enjoyed our visit to the Kerala Folklore Museum, although it is a museum unlike any other, full of eclectic items from Kerala’s history. There was so much to look at and it was arranged in a very interesting style, and the guides were very helpful, definitely worth…"

A treasure house of Kerala heritage,"A family run enterprise and owned by a private trust, the collection contained in this three storeyed heritage house constructed to reflect the traditional architecture style, is truly impressive. Most of the internal structure is made of wood, and I was particularly awed by the…"
Wonderful museum,"The Kerala Folklore Museum is built in the traditional Keralan-style architecture covering Malabar on the ground floor, Kochi on the 1st and Travancore on the 2nd. The museum is an anthropologist’s delight housing about 4000 artefacts depicting Kerala’s heritage, including the…"
Worth a quick visit,A quick visit to the museum should be accommodated in kochi itinerary as it wove a nice glimpse into the history and art of Kerala. Commendable is the fact that it is. A one man/ family collection   It’s well located on the way from airport or lulu mall to fort kochi so can be…
"Interesting collection, a little disorganised ","An interesting collection of sculptures, wood work, pottery, Chinese storage jars, bronzes, stone work, old paintings and photos, jewellery, utensils, agricultural tools, ceremonial weapons, and other artefacts from across the centuries and different areas of Southern India. Housed in a equally eclectic building that has been put together from various salvaged ancient structures. It’s definitely worth a visit and some of the works on display are simply stunning, although it is a little overwhelming as the lower floors are crammed full of items displayed in a very haphazard fashion. It feels a little chaotic and quirky, and for us this made it a little more interesting. However, there’s no real organisation either by era or origin although types of items (coins, weapons etc) are mostly presented together. Some items are labelled and give brief descriptions. As a consequence it doesn’t really tell a story/inform or give much idea of the context for some of the items on display - its therefore more of a visual rather than educational/museum experience. There also does not appear to be much thought to preserving items - most are on open display in a warm and humid environment. A few ‘do not touch’ signs, but little in the way of any control of this. It’s also a little unclear on the upper floor what are display as opposed to shop items, and the mixture of things from fridge magnets to quite expensive painted face masks or prints makes it difficult to know if you are buying goods produced for the tourist market or genuine hand produced works."
GOOD WITH FAMILY AND TEEN CHILDRENS,"one of the fine attraction when you visit kochi,mattancheri,we can see the finely curated remains of the past history."
Nice collection of Kerala Heritage,The place contains a collection of Kerala culture and its rich heritage. It depicts the life in Kerala since ages till now.
Worth a visit!,A very interesting private collection of items spanning approximately 35 years. It houses some very unusual artefacts including the traditional Indian masks from different regions of India which can be bought by the general public. I purchased some very attractive jewellery at a very reasonable price.
Worth visiting,A must-see.Very welcoming staff.Rich cultural heritage of Kerala.Easily accessible by public transport.
