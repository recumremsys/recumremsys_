Merchant past of old Vladimir,"This water tower  is nice and compact, to keep you warm on a winter day, with a panoramic platform on top, tells you of XIX century life of this provincial little town Vladimir, that used to be Russia`s big heart long time back and lost all of its glory from XIII century onwards, nice old pictures and household items,  enough to give you an idea and travel back in time, a bit sporty staircase to climb, so be ready for this little effort. Tip for history fans: as to lder items from early history of Vladimir ( 3D medieval city plan, silver coins the size of the fish scales,  and bronze age exhibits) those  can be found in Vladimir`s red-brick history museum, street nearby St.Dimitry Cathedral"
Nice museum,The museum is very nice. What we liked most was the wedding newspaper of 1917 in Russian that is on display in the museum and in sale in the souvenir shop.
Impressive collection,This houses a collection mainly related to the local glass industry. It catalogues its increase in expertise and scope. There are also other crafts displayed such as embroidery and the laquer box making
Water tower which became to a museum,The relatively new building of the water towe built on top of a hill a century ago became to serve as a museum to the history of old Vladimir. There is an obsevation platform at the top of the tower. An additional observation point free of charge is just in front of the tower. This site is very close to the Golden gate and to the nearby Trinity churchbuild a century ago as well.
Small interesting museum with great view,"This is a small cheep museum about history of Vladimir. Some exponants are very interesting. It's all about small details - old advertisements, old documents. But you have to know Russian to notice them.The view form the top of the tower is great."
Very interesting musuem,Glad we added this as it was a wonderful museum of the history. Some great artifacts. Certainly exceeded my expectations. Also a nice view point from the top. 
Decent museum but amazing view,"The museum is a small thing situated in 3 or 4 levels in the building pictured, but what really makes this place special is the view. You can climb all the way to the top where there is an inside and outside viewing area. You can see out over all of Vladimir and out into the…"
Nice point of interest,"This successful combination of the museum and viewing platform. From above excellent views as city of Vladimir, and the nature surrounding it open.  On four floors of the museum there are a lot of interesting exhibits which give an idea of life of citizens in the 19th century.…"
Nice view!,Don't visit the museum but look really good from outside. It was just water tower but just look at this arcitecture!
