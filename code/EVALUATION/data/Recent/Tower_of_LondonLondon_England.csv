Need to improve using new technologies.,"There is no doubt, it is an incredible attraction for tourist in London, for that reason I felt that more can be done about explaining how people used to live back on that time ... using more videos and new technologies to replicate it. The Crown Jewels is breathtaking, incredible collection."
v good,"This review may contain spoilers for the tower so please read with caution. I do not know where to begin with this review. The tower is amazing and there is lots to see. I was surprised by how small the torture place was, although this would of been a good thing for the people that were tortured maybe. There is a big variety of different windows, and there are also lots of squirrels and ravens which is nice. There is also a room full of pretend horses which was a bit scary but it was okay. Considering we went on a Saturday afternoon, the place was not busy and it was easy to roam around and look at everything at a pace we wanted. It is a really fun day out and there is loads of interesting things to look at too!!"
Tower of London - overpriced ,"Overall there wasn’t much exciting to see except from the Crown Jewels whereby there was a massive queue just to see them for a space of 5 minutes. Extremely expensive and overpriced. I only spent half an hour if that there, and would say it is more suited to the older generation."
Brilliant ,"With no queues, we were able to wonder around without impediment. We got to see the Crown Jewels without being rushed, and took time to marvel at places so steeped in history. I wish the Yeoman Tours was on, but in the current climate, it is understandable why they are cancelled - this said, they are around ti answer questions."
worth visiting ,"quite a lot  open and no queues for anyting so we were able   to relax and take pour time.      a must it visiting London,  Nice day ..beautiful"
Great visit,Great visit to the Tower. Very friendly beefeaters and the Crown jewels were stunning. Shame some places were not open but still a great day.
September 2020,"Very quiet,we went at 12noon, no queues to get in or to see the Crown Jewels.Great time to visitRavens were on form"
Nice day out,Lovely day out. Went during COVID so no queues. Quite expensive but worthwhile. Loved the Crown Jewels too.
History,Really enjoyable visit..lots to see...stepped in history..approachable staff...have been before..always see something new
Trip with the kids,"Brilliant, went for 11am on a Sunday, quiet to begin with, would recommend seeing the Crown Jewels first, there was no queue when we arrived but had to wait 10/15 mins to enter later on.  Could still see the Jewels without anyone in the way which was great.  There was a lot we didn't get to see so will go back.  Kids really enjoyed it, especially the scavenging Raven!"
Definitely worth visiting.,"We were lucky to book this visit during the pandemic which meant the queues were minimal and we nearly had the place to ourselves. The Beefeaters were engaging, the battlements offered great views but I have to say the Crown Jewels topped off the whole visit. So much history to take onboard and I certainly learned so much. I cannot recommend this visit enough and look forward to the next time when I take my children."
"Very quiet for a summer’s day, but not as quiet as I had been led to believe","Having seen several reviews, and some advertising, saying how quiet the Tower of London was we decided to give it a try.The highlight of this visit of St Thomas’s Tower with the reconstruction of Edward I's bed-chamber – a wonderful room with fantastic views; just now sure how we missed this on our last visit!This was our second visit this year (meaning our “Historic Royal Palaces” family pass has already saved us money) – the last was in January and I can definitely say the Tower of London was busy than in January.  In January there were no queues to see the crown jewels, in August there was a long queue. The advantage of the HRP pass is that you don’t feel you have to see everything in one go (hence missing St Thomas’s tower on the previous visit) which then makes the whole visit a lot more relaxing.During lockdown there are no warden tours, so the Beefeaters were a lot more visible and easier to ask questions of.  In addition, the area next to the Thames was cordoned off and only accessible to those visiting the tower (a huge plus as this area is often packed with sightseers).  Outdoor catering and toilets are available. Not all of the Tower of London has re-opened, but still well worth a visit."
Perfect day out whilst not full of tourists.,We took advantage of the quiet tourist free London to book the Tower of London.  It was amazing to stroll around without the crowds and take our time to see everything the Tower has to offer.  The staff and guards were so nice and had all the time in the world to explain parts of history to us.  Highly recommend you book a visit whilst London is so quiet.
Great few hours exploring,"I was first in the queue as the Tower opened at 10am. There is a ceremony you can see if you are at the front of the queue. Well worth exploring all the areas, although it is worth noting some areas are closed due to COVID."
Great experience,We had a lovely time visiting the Tower of London. It was very well run with all COVID measures adhered to.
Really disappointing ,While we were expecting changes due to covid - one way systems and extra queing time we were not prepared for most of the attractions to be shut. The buildings inside were crammed with no social distancing and no staff presence to enforce sense and order and the route forces you to walk your children through two gift shops which adds insult to injury when already paying full price for half an experience.If you want to visit I would wait until things are back to normal
Quiet day at the tower,"Visited during the pandemic and it was very quiet, very few people there. This made for a great day out, as we could take our time and really appreciate the beautiful historic buildings. Everywhere was very clean, some exhibits were off limits due to the potential of contamination, but this did not spoil our visit."
Great experience,"Absolutely loved this tour! It felt like I was back in time due to the village like atmosphere. We didnt have a tour guide, but everything was signposted very well and this allowed us to take our time in each section. Any guide we did encounter, was immensely nice, very friendly people always willing to help. It was a wonderful experience!"
Great few hours ,"I don't typically give reviews to attractions but this was excellent so I thought I would. All precautions for Covid-19 were well managed, first and foremost. Not been before so have no comparison but it was very quiet. Lots of space to read, watch, look and soak it all up. Who knew there was wild, exotic animals there? Fascinating. It was a shame one area was closed but in the grand scheme of things this was a really enjoyable few hours. Highly recommend."
Crown Jewels,"I recently went to The Tower of London and had a wonderful day. The highlight was seeing the Crown Jewels which were absolutely stunning. It was very well organised and we all felt very safe. Obviously because of all the precautions being taken there weren’t many people about which made the experience really good as there was no queuing . We spent a while talking to one of the beefeaters ,whose name was Paul, and he was very interesting and such a nice man."
Brillant,"Fantastic day out, plenty of space no crowds. Time to visit without tourist no queues, no rushing. Crown Jewels brilliant. The tower need us to visit so book tickets and enjoy."
Support the Tower,"As London is very quiet at the moment, it's the best time to be a local tourist and visit these gems that are usually packed full of tourists. Always wanted to visit and glad we did because we had the place pretty much all to ourselves. You can walk around and the very friendly staff and Beefeaters will welcome you and talk about the history. The Crown jewels are a must see and especially now because you can really enjoy them in peace. Even in these Covid times, you still get to see 95% percent of the Tower and exhibitions. Just remember to wear a face mask and they provide hand gel throughout the visit. These landmarks need your support because they have suffered of having zero tourism."
Spend some time,"This was such a pleasant surprise. We have been to London many times but didnt go to the Tower until now. The tour is so worth it , the Beefeaters are funny and informative, so much history and so much to see. After the tour you can walk around and enjoy all the places. We had gone precovid though as context, but really enjoyed the plays put on through out the grounds recreating events from history. Loved it would recommend"
Brilliant,Brilliant! We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The stories you hear on the way round are made for teenage boys! Crown Jewels are spectacular. Can’t recommend enough.
Mr & Mrs Abedalkarim ,"We visited the Tower on Sunday and we are very disappointed that we were not informed about the facilities that would be closed off ,  it seems most of the jewels were locked away. We understand about the COVID situation but the cost was inappropriate with lack of advanced closures."
Birthday visit to Lindon,Not been in the Tower for very many years..it seems to have changed..thought there was a lot more to see ..even with covid wd should have been made aware when purchasing tickets that a lot of the Tower would be cordened off to the public..bit disappointed as it wasnt really how I remembered it.
Worth a Historical Visit,Crown Jewels are just awesome. You have to admire the craftsmanship of these beautiful pieces of our history.  We could not guess the value! Lovely to see the Yeomans and Guards in their uniforms.  The Yeomans are so informative and such gents! Walk around the battlements for goods views of London. Traitors Gate is no longer is surrounded by water but stand there and think about the poor souls entering their fate.
Perhaps expensive but so worth it!,"It’s such a long time since I visited the Tower of London and at £67.50 for the two adults and a child you couldn’t call it cheap. However, it was SO worth it and I’d recommend it as a day out that is great value for money. Shame the Coronavirus has reduced numbers so much and also makes the cafe and refectory not worth opening, but it’s a small point."
For history lovers,"Well preserved monument, with reach history. Early visit recommended to avoid large groups. A tour guide was very helpful."
"Informative visit, not crowded","I took my 13-year old nephew to explore this icon of British history. DeUe to the recent lockdown, there were only a few people visiting which made the trip somewhat special as we didn‘t have to put up with thousands of tourists.Very pleasant and relaxed tour. I didn‘t like the conveyer belt one has to use when seeing the crown jewels."
The Crown Jewels! ,"Loved this place, satisfied a life long ambition to see the Crown Jewels which did not disappoint. So much more to offer to! Thoroughly enjoyed it all."
Such a fantastic day out,"We thoroughly enjoyed an excellent day out at the Tower of London. It has been over 30 years since we last visited, but Covid-19 has actually created a brilliant time to see this magnificent fortress ... without all of the crowds.Although the Covid-19 restrictions has stopped the very entertaining guide walks and talks by the Yeomen Warders, they were still around and very keen to talk to the public. So much so, that we had lots of interesting and funny chats with every Warder we met.All of the staff inside the buildings were very keen to provide information and I had a fascinating chat with the lady who was on hand near the Imperial State Crown. I learned a lot from her about the jewels in the crown and how they were obtained.The Covid-19 arrangements in place are excellent, with masks only worn inside buildings. Plenty of hand sanitizer stations around the area, inside and out.A most excellent day out and I thoroughly recommend the Tower as a great visit, even during the Covid-19 restrictions."
One of the best experiences I have ever had!,"Wow! This is a fantastic trip. Firstly, to be there without the usual crowds was brilliant as you could really take your time and get a good look at everything. There is so much to see with so many twists and turns.An absolute highlight... in fact one of greatest moments I have ever experienced was visiting the Crown Jewels. Simply stunning and displayed so fantastically so you can really soak it up from all angles and see every detail. A wonderful lady (I wish I had her name to quote) took time to personally explain each item and tell us all about its history and the different gems that were in them, who they were designed for etc. She was fabulous and really went the extra mile! Overall one of the best attractions I have visited in London! I LOVED it and will never forget my experience."
"Historic gaol, fortress and Palace.","Always wanted to visit, I did the trip and did so now as without the crowds especially the large tour groups, you could take your time and we enjoyed the extra space and time.we had.The crown Jewels, The Armoury and the Architecture were all just really awesome, as were the knowledgeable Beefeaters who were very welcoming. If you get the tube to Tower Hill make sure you take in the Roman wall as you walk to the Tower. The Romans chose the spot due to its unique dominant location, as did the Towers builders.."
London is the most beautiful city in the world we travel for a business and we have so much experience we can’t,London is the most beautiful city in the world we travel for a business and we have so much experience we can’t wait to come back
Mdg has terribl,"Mdg has terrible service, they wasted my time for several days and then they canceled my order after the funds for the down payment cleared successfully from my account because...  of a mistake they made. The account we originally had on file couldn't make ACH Transactions so we changed it to one that could and I was told everything was successful and I'd be receiving my order within 2 weeks. Not only did they cancel my order but they never reached out to me. I would highly recommend avoid doing business with mdg.read more"
Birthday day out at the tower ,"So due to covid 19 our plans for my daughters 30th has to be curtailed and after some thought we decided a day at the tower followed by afternoon tea would be lovely. The Tower is immaculate, the Crown Jewels simply breathtaking and the queues non existent due to the current situation! The Beefeaters were helpful and really friendly ! Superb day out made even better by the lackOfPeople"
No crowds,We booked our tickets online and spent 3 hours looking round the tower. For us our trip was all the better for the lack of crowds and we enjoyed the extra space and time we had. It’s a great time to go and support this attraction.
Very nice and educational,Good value for money as we spent 4 hours learning British history from one of the cradles. Very interesting and nice.
Ask for Luis!,"A wonderful experience, in particular the tour of the Crown Jewels by Luis who was generous with his time and gave brilliant insight and history to each of the crowns and their diamonds. Thank you for making our day special."
Tower during cobid,"Some parts of the tower were closed, yoemans tours weren’t taking place but had the Crown Jewels entirely to ourselves."
Brilliant,Brilliant time had by ourselves and 5 yr old grandsonLoved visiting and seeing everything without too many people gave us a chance to really look at the Crown JewelsEveryone was very helpful and informative from Beefeaters to gift shop staff etcSocial distancing and signs fo entrance and exit were clear Thank you for a wonderful time Definitely recommend and will return
Tower,I think the tickets are a bit pricey but it's worth a visit and the staff are all very informative and friendly
Goosebumps on 1000 years of history ,"We visited during coronavirus, taking all necessary precautions. It is effectively empty. If you ever thought to visit but were put off by crowds of tourists and school trips, now is the time to visit.And what an amazing experience the Tower gives you... goosebumps.They are providing an excellent experience, with little to no, noticeable restrictions. Go now!"
Beautiful place to visit,"Well I accidentally went a day sooner than my actual tour so I just walked around, but the place is amazing and I definitely recommend seeing this place!"
Locked-down at the Tower,"Staff were as helpful as ever, but the limits of social distancing meant that some of the attractions were ""off limits"". Atmosphere with so few people around was so different from previous visits - calm and enjoyable."
One of the best days out,"My son has been learning about Henry VIII so we brought him here. The Beefeaters are always so friendly and eager to chat, but it was great visiting soon after it has reopened as there were no crowds. Although a couple of parts were still closed, there was still plenty to see and we didn’t feel we had missed out."
Great day! ,We had amazing day visiting Tower of London. The armoury exhibition was incredible  and the crown jewellery just breathtaking.
  A Magnificent Setting,"Situated just behind the Thames river,  the tower  commands impresive views of Tower Bridge, and the more modern skyscrapers.  A mere ten minute walk from Tower Hill tube station, you just follow the signs around & down the side, to the entrance.  You enter across the moat, and work your way up to Traitors Gate.  You can stop off to get a free map / a reasonably priced guide book.  Both the entrance ticket and guide book, need to be booked in advance; for social diatancing numbers.  The smaller areas of the palace are cordoned off, but there is still a lot to see.  The medieval expense of the bedchamber and chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, show the different fabrics used by royalty.  This contrasts sharply with the small plain chapel, and leads sharply on to the executions area.     Most people (inculding myself), go onto the White Tower next; built by William the Conquer.   Here you see the brutality of the middle ages, with a marvellous armoury collection.  Later leading to mixed weapons, such as the mace gun; and then jewelled weapons (both donated and confiscated).  This leads to the Crown Jewels, with its own escalator to take you past the main collection. The slowest escalator in London!  Other interesting bits to see are the Grenadier Guards, with their bearskin hats.  The guards drill on the sound of the chimes, with another guard down the far end.  Be sure to keep your hands to yourself, as the one Grenadier shouted out 'off the trees.'  They used to keep animals under ground in cages, as well as people in the dungeons.    None of the water fountains are on, due to the pandemic;  but there is a icecream seller as you come out the Crown Jewels building.  There's also a cafè, and three gift shops, as well as giant ravens in and out of their cage.  It'll take over an hour and a half, to two hours to get around; with many winding steps.  It's great to see, and I would do it again.  If you want to go to other palaces, you can upgrade your ticket, to an annual membership.  This'll give you access to six palaces (not all in London), for a year.  You can do this upto two weeks after you buy a regular ticket."
Fantastic History Lesson,"The Tower has been in my family history since the early 1400s, my grandfathers were constables at the tower, one grandfather was beheaded there in 1547 and my 2nd cousins Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard also met the same fate. The chance to visit doesn't present itself often due to commitments, however, yesterday was such a day. I'd been chatting with the governor and the curator recently and I seized the moment of opportunity to visit.We parked the car in the Tower Hill Coach and Car-Park just a few minutes walk to the Tower, there were no queues as one might usually expect, as due to COVID-19  you have to pre-book with a time-slot. Well, we arrived 15 minutes early and were let straight in. There was a small bag search on the way in but everyone was socially distanced.Once inside there were no Yeoman warders giving guided tours of course, which is fully understandable, but due to a lack of visitors there was also no ""crush"" to see elements of the tower and we could, at leisure make our way around the tower soaking up the history. At certain points, there were Yeoman warders who were more than happy to chat about history and we learnt quite a few new things yesterday. A special mention to Yeoman Warder Briggs and Yeoman Sergeant Fuller who were very helpful indeed. The crown jewels are usually heaving, queued for ages, but we were able to just walk on in, and linger to view at our leisure, even go up and down the travelator a few times.Accessibility wise, I took my mobility scooter and it was a nightmare on the cobbled streets, a real bone-shaker, but doable. The Disabled toilets behind the jewel house were spotless and worthy of a 5* alone. We couldn't go in the white tower due to mobility issues, but it didn't make for any less an enjoyable visit.If you want to visit.... now is the time to do so"
A must in london,"If you have time for one thing on London, this should be it. You will be overwhelmed by the history and the whole tower experience. I cannot sell this enough."
Day at the Tower of London,Had a great time today 6/9/20 no queuing no big crowds had more time to take things in and everyone doing their part with social distancing
Visit with our grandchildren,We came here today and I hadn’t been in about 25 years. My husband and I loved it but my grandchildren thought it was awesome. My granddaughter thought the Crown Jewels were her favourite as did my husband. My grandson like the artillery exhibition which had the armour and the horses. I loved the torture unit. This had some sinister items that were genuinely used as punishment from some time ago. This is probably one of the best days I have had in such a long time.
A good day out,"We visited on a Sunday morning, it was fascinating! The Crown Jewels were amazing to see and we also had a chat with one of the ravens. The guards were very helpful and knowledgeable, talking to them was very interesting."
Definitely worth visiting,Great day out at the Tower. Quite a lot open and no queues for anything so we were able to relax and take our time. The exhibitions in the buildings were good and the Yeoman Warders and other staff were happy to answer any questions. The Crown Jewels are really spectacular and we had them almost to ourselves. Social distancing etc well managed without feeling intrusive. Definitely recommended to visit.
Great First Time Visit,"For some reason we have never tried the Tower of London but seemed the best choice in the current climate.On a warm or hot sunny day this is a must. There are multiple towers to explore , all rich with fascinating royal history. Even with our young children , the content kept their interest throughout the tour.The Crown Jewels are a sight to behold and worth a visit on its own.There were no queues or crowds due to the pandemic which made the whole experience comfortable and we never felt rushed at any point.Furthermore we had the privilege of watching the guards changing as well as regular conversations with the Yeomans.At the moment I would thoroughly recommend a visit.Ps. Be aware of the ravens , they will take your food !There were a couple of food outlets around though for the reason above I would recommend doing this before or after your visit ( upon exit there are multiple cafes / coffee shops)."
Quiet trip,"The Tower is one of those things I've always meant to do so took the opportunity while general tourist levels lower.Arrived at 1pm, walked straight in with pre booked tickets.  Staff all very friendly and Beefeaters keen to share their knowledge and answer questions.No queue for the jewels  did an extra lap of the travelator to fully admire the bling and were able to take our time looking at the state crown.Line of kings is particularly impressive, especially the horses.Lots of hand sanitizer and people being sensible with masks.Well worth a trip without the crowds."
Good trip,Good trip though quite expensive also good 4 schools and  colleges in London you need now to be covid-19  friendly
An Iconic Site in the Heart of London.,"I had not visited The Tower of London since I was a teenager but over the year's , although wishing to pay another visit , I have always  put the idea to one side , put off by the thought of it's popularity & large volume of visitor's.However, over 50 year's on, I took advantage of the unfortunate advent of Covid-19 to pay another visit. I learned, via BBC News that after a period of closure that The Tower was re- opening, albeit with a daily limit on the visitor number's & also only opening Wed - Sun.I booked my ticket on - line ( good , easy to use site with plenty of historical information & a map for downloading ).I duly turned up a little before my appointed time & entered via the gate beneath The Byward Tower.There has been a terrific amount written about the Tower's history , both factual & legendary/mythical so I am only describing my visit. A one way system is in existence which is useful but not necessarily adhered to. Some parts of The Tower normally open to the public are at present closed but the vast amount is accessible.Despite the greatly reduced visitor number's there was soon a long queue to view The Crown Jewels & also to access The White Tower.I must admit that I skipped The Crown Jewels but overall it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The Beefeater's appeared to be friendly & engaging.Many people were wearing masks but it was evidently not an enforced policy.Once you leave via the outer moat re admission is not possible although you are still in The Tower's precincts.. Actually this area is very rewarding, offering excellent view's up & down the River Thames & back to the Tower.Eventually , one leaves via the gift shop.There are plenty of information boards around. A little more information on them would have been Good.If you want to view The Crown Jewels my advice is to book an entry ticket to The Tower for as early as possible & go straight to them."
Another great trip,I have been to the Tower of London before but it was many years ago. I took my partner this time round and they chuffed with the experience.  It’s lockdown so to our surprise it was lovely and quiet considering it was August . The Crown Jewels & armoury was our favourite especially as the staff were so nice around that area.
Great,I haven't been to the Tower for about 50 years and my partner has never been so we decided to include it on this trip.Really well organised and socially distanced with limited numbers. masks worn in all interior areas. Worked really well.
Bigger then you think,"Due to Corvid 19, the Tower was all a one way system which wired brilliantly. I hope they keep the same process going after Corvid. The Beefeaters are a pleasure to talk too with the Crown Jewels taking all the spoils. A great visit"
Amazing attraction - and so quiet,"Visited the Tower on Monday, first time for all but my wife. Thanks to COVID-19 (one tiny positive), it was very quiet with a maximum of 2,500 visitors that day vs the usual 14-15,000 in August. Amazing place and the Beefeaters/Yeomen Warders were so friendly and happy to tell us more about the exhibits, their experiences etc. It’s a shame to see London so quiet but, selfishly, made our visit extra special as no fighting with the crowds. Highly recommended."
Worth a visit and 100% worth having a tour,"I had a tour with one of the guides and it was absolutely incredible. I cannot recommend it more highly. Harry was informative, funny and had so much knowledge. I learned so much. The social distancing was very well maintained and there was hand sanitizer stations everywhere. We went around the Crown Jewels a few times as there was so much to hear about it all, the diamonds were stunning. I would go again for sure. Kensington Palace was ok but only took about an hour to get around, the Tower of London was for sure the show stealer."
Fantastic - well worth a visit,"As a family of 3 we visited the Tower of London in Aug 20 – when the lockdown had been lifted but everywhere still quiet. I have to say what a fantastic experience this was. Whilst it is sad to see the numbers down and not as many people visiting, but as a tourist to this site it was amazing. No queues to see the Crown Jewels which are truly stunning and breath-taking…in fact they were so mesmerising that we went in twice and on the second time we were in the viewing room alone, we took ages looking at everything, we felt really lucky. The Yeoman guards were all friendly and were keen to answer any questions and were more than happy to talk about the history and points of interest. The guard near the Bloody Tower was particularly informative and he spent ages with us telling us about Sir Walter Raleigh and the history of his time in the Tower. The white Tower is also amazing, with so many interesting and historic pieces to look at and information to read. This place is fantastic, we spent ages walking around, saw the ravens, visited the café and the shop. I know we visited in exceptional times and I hope that the visitor numbers increase for the attraction but believe me seeing this place when it was quite with no queues and being able to go around at our leisure was truly a privilege. It is fantastic. If you only do one thing in London - do this."
First Time in London,"A fantastic and amazing tourist attraction. So much rich history. The crown Jewels, The Armoury and the Architecture were all just really awesome. Everyone who visits London should visit the Tower of London."
Quiet visit,Much quieter at the minute due to COVID restrictions so a good time to visit. There are some things that are closed but you can still see a lot and have more time to view. The medieval palace is great as you really get an understanding of how rooms were decorated and how buildings were built. There was a short queue for the White Tower but once in you had plenty of time to view the Line of Kings and the armour display and to enjoy the quiet of St Johns Chapel. The queue for the Crown Jewels was a little longer but moved quickly and again once inside was not busy. There is now a travelator to stand on and go down both sides of the Jewels and you can do this as many times as you wish. The speed is just right for viewing the jewels. There are quite a few steps to get into the various towers.
Not what I expected,"Only took about an hour to get round, Not really much to see even if everything was open which it wasn’t.Queues for white tower and Crown Jewels were never ending.Best bit was walking along with a raven as he didn’t seem at all bothered by humans."
Great visit to an iconic venue,"An awesome experience. COVID restrictions help the POV not being too busy. However, some places were not open to visit. The whole family loved the experience and great picture opportunities, shame you can’t take a picture of the jewels etc, however, this is standard.Staff were really friendly and helpful too. A really great experience and so interesting about how the staff work there and actually live there too.Brilliant experience."
Underwhelming ,"Overall found the place a little underwhelming. A few of the exhibitions were shut due to Covid restrictions. The grounds are immaculate though. They say to allow around 3 hours for a tour but we were done  after an hour. The Yoeman Warden advised us that they usually accommodate 14,000 people on a bank holiday weekend but this was capped at 2,500 which allowed for shorter queues which was nice. We never queued for more than 5 minutes to enter the popular exhibitions (crown jewels, torture chamber, white tower)."
Great atmosphere ,It’s best area in London but restaurant around there are little expensive but it’s mind relaxing area and great atmosphere
Expected more but worth a visit ,"Despite it being through lockdown, the place itself was quite interesting. Would not spend £25 on it again. There was quite poor management of social distancing, but not much that the staff could do as everyone was trying to get to the exhibit as soon as possible. There was a lot to see but sadly we didn’t have enough time for it. If you are looking to go, I would suggest to allow yourself 2/3 hours just in case of any queues that might happen. Best thing to see was the Crown Jewels as they are incredible! It doesn’t have much details on the history of the royal family, but it does have a lot interesting facts."
An average experience.,"The Tower is certainly feeling the effects of Covid. You have to book online. No telephones are manned so no one to answer any questions. I, at first, had a problem downloading my tickets but there was no telephone line to report a problem. I eventually did download them. It was a good job I managed to do it because the email I sent about the issue was not answered until after the date of my visit. A number of the attractions are not open and there are no Beefeater tours, which is a shame because everyone likes them. I just wonder if, with a bit of organisation and determination, the tours could happen. Social distancing and limited numbers could easily be part of the arrangements. There aren't too many people visiting at the moment which is a good thing. We queued for about 35 minutes to see the Crown Jewels. I imagine it is much longer in normal times. The Tower is a wonderful group of buildings but, I feel there is something lacking.  The Beefeater tours need to be reestablished, The torture museum - always appealing to young boys - was a real disappointment. We don't expect it to be like the London Dungeon, but it definitely needs to be a little more graphic and with more detail. I first went about 40 years ago with my children, This time it was with my grandson. He wasn't hugely impressed so I think this will be my last visit."
enjoyable but poor access,It was very enjoyable but very badly set up for wheelchair users . ( lift closed off because of covid ) and some areas not accessible at all .
Fantastic,Definitely worth buying ticket on line to skip the queues. If you are visiting London I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Tower of London. Founded. In 1066 this UNESCO world heritage site sits in the banks of the river Thames. The history surrounding it and played out within its walls cannot fail to interest adults and children alike. The Crown Jewels are also housed there - book ahead as there is always a queue. Great shop and lots of cafes in the area. It is a fantastic day out.
Go now whilst it’s quiet!,"Perfect time to visit as it’s so quiet at the moment! Felt very safe as plenty of space to distance from others. Was disappointed the Yeoman Warder tour wasn’t on but understandable given Covid and they were at least dotted around the grounds ready and very willing to answer all our questions ‘Spike’ was particularly informative and a great story teller! Such an interesting historical sight, delightful staff, stunning jewels and hilarious ravens! Would strongly recommend for all ages. Only negative would be the website should advise what is running due to Covid aftermath to avoid disappointment."
Not the same after lockdown,"Visited the first day they opened after lockdown, but sadly a few places within the site were still closed due to covid which was a shame. However, I would recommend the Tower if it's your first time visiting. It was my second time and not as worthwhile. The place felt a bit hollow. Hopefully things will pick up again long after covid."
Lovely quiet day in a normally busy spot,Had a lovely day here. Extremely quiet considering we were at one of the biggest tourist attractions in London and it was lovely to experience. Would highly recommend it!
Fantastic afternoon,A great afternoon. We entered around 1.30 & didn’t have to queue. There is plenty to look around including the White Tower & Crown Jewels. I had read online that there was a one way system but this wasn’t clear. There was a large queue for the jewels however this moved fairly quickly. Viewing the jewels you are stood on a conveyer belt so get just a brief look but it is well worth it. There are still some areas closed for example the cafe and the chapel but I still had a great day. Staff are all friendly & helpful. I particularly recommend visiting to anyone with an interest in history or photography as there are great opportunities for atmospheric photos. Loved it. Thank you.
Birthday treat,Loved the Tower of London it’s history and of course the Raverns. Great Covid 19 precautions put in place and never queued.
An absolute gem of a place.....,"Visited today, with a 10am pre-booked ticket. It was eerily quiet, but we obviously took advantage of the shorter queues and limited numbers.We've walked past the Tower of London numerous times, on numerous previous visits, but the crowds always put me off, so today was perfect.I absolutely loved the visit. Fascinating, quirky, and the Yeoman Warders were fabulous. The Crown Jewels were utterly stunning, and almost worth the admission fee alone. Loved reading about our amazing history, and interesting past. My teenage boys were interested too, and enjoyed the suits of armour in the White Tower. Well wirth a visit, especially with reduced numbers. We left at 1 and most places had queues to get in."
Great visit without the ques.,"It was great to see the Crown Jewels and not have to que for ages. We had a 10:00 timed entry ticket which meant the que to get in was only 5 minutes. Then when inside you could walk straight into the Crown Jewels and White Tower without any que. Some areas such as the Bloody Tower were empty when we went in, it was really strange. It did seem to have got a lot busier when we left around 12:30, so if you can go early. Wonderful trip which we all really enjoyed."
Brilliant,"Loved, loved, loved it! Our daughter has been desperate to go since watching ‘Gangster Granny’ Thoroughly enjoyed the experience"
Just brilliant ,"We spent a hugely enjoyable day in the Tower of London today. The fact that the tickets are for timed entry means that the queues are not too long and it is not too crowded. The signage is great, many parts are open and empty, and the Crown Jewels simply wonderful. This is an attraction in London that is worth every penny. The Beefeaters are the icing on the cake - really friendly and knowledgable. If you want a Covid safe, fun, clean, efficiently  run and totally fascinating historical attraction in London then this is the one!"
Still inordinately long queues for the Crown Jewels,"This is the time to visit such attractions as the Tower of London they said. The prospect of much shorter queues than usual because of the current shortage of tourists both from overseas as well as home-grown. Perhaps too many heard such news because apart from little to no queuing to get in the main entrance the queues to access the Crown Jewels this afternoon wound several times in front of the building housing them before heading downhill for about half a mile. Fortunately the queue for the armour collection in the White Tower was shorter than usual but some upper floors were, I think, closed."
Nice day out ,"We had a really good day out to the tower today. You have to book in advance and we booked the 10.30 slot, if you can definitely book early as it got busier in the afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to see the Crown Jewels and 20mins to access the white tower. Wait times were considerably longer by the afternoon. The staff are doing a great job managing access to ensure social distancing is maintained. Almost everywhere is now open with the exceptions of the church and the Beauchamp tower. Be aware the HRP cafe is closed and only a Gourmet Sausage outlet is open so queues are huge and the food was atrocious. £6.50 for a bratwurst in a role, very poor quality and definitely not worth it. If we had know. I’d have brought food in with us. This was the only part of the day to let us down."
There's so much history,"Located on the north bank of the River Thames and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, the Tower of London has, at different times, been a royal residence, a menagerie, an arsenal, a place of execution, a political prison, a royal mint and a public records office.  The original fortress (the White Tower) was built, in the 1080s, by William the Conqueror TO DETER FOREIGN INVADERS and to cower Londoners.  Thereafter, it was added to by various monarchs.  The Tower was a royal residence until the 17th century and, from the 13th century until 1834, its Lion Tower housed the Royal Menagerie.  In the Middle Ages it was a prison and place of execution.  Amongst those killed were Sir Thomas More, Anne Boleyn (the second wife of King Henry VIII) and Lady Jane Grey (and her husband Lord Dudley).  Even as late as the First World War, several spies were executed by firing squad.  The Tower has also seen its fair share of murders.  In 1483, the young King Edward V and his younger brother disappeared (and were probably murdered).  That's how the ""Bloody Tower"" got its name.  King Henry VI was also murdered in the chapel in the Wakefield Tower.  The peak period of the use of the Tower as a prison was during the 16th and 17th centuries, when many who had fallen from grace were held.  These included Princes Elizabeth (before she became Queen Elizabeth I) and Sir Walter Raleigh.  There is so much history within its walls that it is easy to see why the Tower of London is the country's most popular tourist attraction and a ""must see"" destination for anyone visitin London."
Enjoyable,It's always a nice place to visit and have your friends visiting the UK go on the tour while I waited and enjoyed a nice cup of tea.. my personal experience when I did it many years ago was awsome  and a good way to understand the history of London and the royals.. definitely will not be the first or last time time I visit.. it's enjoyable every visit.
A must if visiting London,"Great place to visit, lots of interesting facts about the tower and the history of London. Everything is presented really well, lots of places to sit down and soak in the history."
August visit ,"My husband visited on 23rd August. We found it incredibly interesting, and there’s lots to learn! I found it disappointing that they let quite so many people into each building as it was almost impossible to socially distance and sometimes tricky to actually see the exhibitions because there were so many people in each room. The Crown Jewels are fascinating - a must see!"
Wow!,"This is the first time we had visited the Tower of London and it is exceptional.  The crown jewels were like nothing we had ever seem, so very beautiful.  Lovely staff and lovely gardens and the route through the grounds makes sure that you capture everything that there is to see."
"Expensive really but, it’s history","The last time I visited I was about 11, I was surprised at how expensive entrance was and the gift shop staff should wear a Dick Turpin mask. It’s very historic and you can spend a great couple of hours there drinking in the history."
Best time to visit,"Right now is the best time to visit everything is so quiet - took my children on Friday afternoon pre booked online walked straight in ! Covid 19 precautions taken seriously - hand sanitizer stations / one way systems / and floor markings - not all is open to visit and only select drink/ food stalls , but had a great couple of hours ! Thankyou"
"Great Day out, well worth a visit","Fascinating and amazing to walk in the footsteps of so many famous historical characters. We did not bother with the beefeater tour as when we went the crowd was big and we could not hear him at the back, but there is lots of info you can read for yourself as you wander around the tour. We loved the armoury, also the astrological scratchings on the prison wall by a prisoner. We ate in the restaurant hall, which was nice."
Disappointingly busy,They have increased visitor numbers and any social distancing is impossible. Lots of people in poorly ventilated rooms. Not much historical detail available
Brilliant  !! ....really worth a visit ,"Getting to the end of the long Summer holidays with kids trying to think of something different to do. This really was a great  day out for us all.The staff were delightful , very helpful and. informative . Seeing the crown Jewels was definitely the high light of the day. It wasn't  busy so we went round a few times to look  at it all again."
Crown Jewels,"Our visit was dampened by the weather and the fact the Yeomans are unable to do guided tours. I was looking forward to this, but understand the reason why. The place Is full of history and I wish we had a better day with the weather. I would advise that even there being quiet you will still need to queue to see some of the attractions including the Crown Jewels. Not great for visiting with a toddler as many steps and they will most probably get bored inside of the building and wanting to touch everything"
good,Expensive for a family but lovely. A nice dip into history. Crown jewels exquisite. Imagine poor Anne Boleyn
Very beautiful,"Long lines to access the British Crown Jewels, but it's really worth it even once in a lifetime. Very well kept, they even have a space where crows live. Really spectacular."
GO NOW while it's quiet.,First visit for 40 years. Very quiet due to restricted numbers. Take advantage while it lasts.  Not fully open but plenty to keep you interested for an hour or so.
So much history,Booked a timed entry which worked well.  The site has our marked out routes to get around while social distancing.  This is a good time to go as there was plenty of space to look round without any crowds at all.  The Tower is packed with history and has a fantastic atmosphere - you can feel the history coming from all sides.
Go now!,"Lived in London for 25 years and never been so thought now would be a good time to visit.No queues! Saw crown jewels three times!Spent three hours there so £25 was worth it, just."
Tower during the pandemic,Great time to visit. Strenuous efforts everywhere to sanitise. Really quiet ... could go past crown jewels 3 times! Great staff and they need all our support.
Great,"Loved it, couldn’t recommend highly enough! Informative, interesting, fascinating place to explore, as well the surrounding area..Roman walls, etc etc."
Nice day out.,"Nice day out, lots of history to enjoy and beautiful scenery. The staff are really helpful and happy to share their knowledge with you."
"Fantastic place, enjoyed every minute.","Now is the best time to visit this amazing place, with no crowds and no queues.  Such an interesting and beautiful place. The Crown Jewels, Beefeaters, Ravens are unmissable.  They are even participating with ‘Eat out to help out’ so half price off food and soft drinks - unto end of August (but you have to tell the staff that you are dining in, to get the discount). Extremely safe with hand sanitisers everywhere and social distancing.  Top up water bottles before you go as all of the water fountains in London are turned off."
Fantastic!,"Amazing, beautiful place.  Stunning buildings, fascinating history.  So sad to learn from the Beefeaters that it is facing threat of closure following lockdown.  Please visit!  It is quiet and you will see the crown jewels without the usual queues."
Amazing,Great place to visit with lots of history. Grounds are kept immaculate. Particularly enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels.
Great,Fantastic place to visit and shame it was so quiet. Come on peeps come back and support this beautiful city
Wonderful history ,I have been to the Tower of London before but it was years ago I had 2 children with me who have never been before . It’s lockdown so to our surprise it was lovely and quiet for July . We loved the Crown Jewels & armoury the beefeaters were lovely to chat to and made us so welcome . I would recommend this visit to everyone it should not be missed I learnt a lot . I found out about all the exotic animals given to the kings & queens could not live at tower so london zoo was made for them and is the oldest zoo in the world . Lucky they don’t have polar bears at london zoo anymore or any other big animals . It was lovely to see the ravens too .
The Tower of London not to be missed on any visitors agenda.,"I first went to the Tower in December 1957 as a National Service soldier in the Royal Fusiliers, I stayed there for ten weeks carrying out basic training, before joining my Regiment, in which I served for two years, twenty months of which I was posted abroad.I still visit the tower Often at the age of eighty four for Regimental reunions, Over the years I have got to know this wonderful historic place very well and it’s easy to say it really is a Crown Jewell in London’s great history.Recently there has been some talk of making the Beefeaters redundant, Im’e normally slow to anger but this utterly stupid decision is beyond belief, these totally knowledgeable are an integral part of the Tower and all in stands for.Leave well alone."
Fabulous day out,I really enjoyed the tower and especially the Crown Jewels..This place is steeped in history and a fabulous day out for all age groups.
Excellent,"My 10 yr old son has wanted to go for ages and he certainly wasn't disappointed. Restricted numbers allowed in due to Covid so not overcrowded. Not many people there, so able to take time to look around all the rooms, exhibits and crown jewels. The Beefeaters and the guides were fantastic, happy for you to chat with them and ready to answer all questions. Toilet open and also Raven cafe so we could get a drink. Highly recommended."
Best time to go!,"Best time to go! No queuing as only 1000 visitors a day. No queuing at the Crown Jewels. Beefeaters were fantastic with their knowledge, history, enthusiasm, particularly Lois and Sean...you were brilliant!"
Very interesting!,"Lovely day out with family and friends, the museum and the location per se are so engaging! Everyone loved it."
Amazing visit,"Booked tickets and slots online.The Tower has just this week opened ,due to covid 19.It is great to get out and about,and the weather was on our side.The staff at the tower are very helpful,loads of hand sanitizer available around tower.Everything was available to see with social distancing.Only part closed was the Fuselier Museum.And main cafe.A great visit you won’t be disappointed,and it’s as safe as can be."
"Exciting, interesting, beautiful",The Tower of London is amazing. It is great to see the history and great to see an insight into the history of London. The Crown Jewels are incredible and so bright and shiny. But beware that the crowds do get very big for entry into the tower and into the Crown Jewels so get there early and see the jewels first. As this place gets 2.5 million visitors a year.
second great visit to the tower of london,we had a gret second visit here with our historical castles and palaces ticket. Each place we visited and each talk we had was fascinating. The beefeaters were humerous and facilitating and stimulated the imagination. the food was tasty the exhibits well presented and glorious and ravens present! much to be recommended.
Fascinating visit at a quiet time,"I have always wanted to go but have been put off by the vast numbers of visitors. At the current time (pandemic) it is lovely and quiet.  Yes, as some have said visiting now means that not everything is open - the website states this quite clearly (not sure why some have said otherwise!) and I did debate visiting, but I knew that I would never visit during normal times.  I was not disappointed.  The warders were very approachable and answered all of my questions, there were no queues, there was little waiting about to view exhibitions and you could go round the crown jewels as often as you wanted (not often you get to do that.) I love my history (especially my own) but hate crowds and queuing. So if you are like me and prepared to sacrifice missing some of it in exchange for visiting at a unique time and without competing with the crowds then do visit now.By the way a warder told me that I could buy a members pass and go back in to see the bits I had missed plus visit the other palaces in the Historic Royal Palaces - the fee I paid would be deducted from the price.  I will definitely be doing that.  Our tourist attractions need all of our support right now."
"Loved, loved, loved it.",The Beef Eaters and other staff were so friendly and informative.  Such interesting information!  The ravens were a surprise!
Don't go at present,"Really disappointed, I don't think it should be open at present. I have been here before and had a great time. However at present more than half of the tower is closed. This should be made clear on the website before you book tickets. There's a one way system which lots of guests are not following; furthermore during the crown jewels section no one was following social distancing. The workers should be monitoring social distancing, we were standing back and allowing others to see the jewels then would step forward to look and yet others would be pushing in and leaning over us. Then to top it all off they make you exit via the shop to which they make you wear a mask to enter the shop and leave - bear in mind this is the only way out luckily we had masks. I must add the staff in the shop had no masks on. Reqlly disappointed and complete rip off of £25 per ticket. Don't go here at present - especially as hardly anything is open!"
Morning visit,Visited tower of london once it reopened (before most of thrn other attractions).It was very quiet and so very easy to wander around at our leisure the beefeaters were all very friendly and loved to chat.Would have given 5* but the one way only system meant certain parts aren't open currently to the public.
Family visit to the Tower of London,Due to the pandemic we booked as a family for 10.30. We arrived on time and the organisation was excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful. It was a wonderful experience. The Yeomen were exceptional. We were able to see everything. The facilities although limited were excellent. I was with my daughters and grandchildren who loved everything they saw. As an older person everyone was extremely kind and helpful. It was a wonderful experience and we all had a fantastic visit.
Felt ripped off!,"Went with kids and family. Mum booked tickets on the website, but didn’t realise a lot of it is closed due to Covid-19!For £25 (instead of the usual £30) I felt ripped off!The grounds and the houses are beautiful - it’s like a little village inside, the yeomen are friendly and helpful, but all we saw was the White Tower and the Crown Jewels - the rest was closed - the kids were looking forward to seeing the Bloody Tower, but it was closed. We all thought it was quite boring!I think £15 is OK to pay. £25 is FAR too much - especially as I am a British taxpayer living in London - these things should be free or heavily discounted for us, it’s our history!In the summer months, roughly 12,000 people visit the tower, at around £30 per person that is ALOT of money!"
OK if you have never been before,"Loved the history and the architecture. Loved the armour and weaponry. Very disappointed in the lack of the torture section, I remember visiting here a long time ago and being amazed by all the equipment and the sheer scale of it all, I rambled on for ages telling my 14 year old son, who is mad on history, how amazing it was to be met by a few sheets of perspex and a couple of items.Won't be travelling here again for a while. Worth a visit if you like history."
To many people taking selfies,I really enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London though it was way too busy full of selfie   taking tourists who didn't care about the history of the place. I had to wait 20 minutes to see the crown jewels because of everyone had there backs to it and phones out.
Bad audioguide,"I really enjoyed it, so much history! Crown jewels - awesome! But the audio guide in Russian was awful. I chose the Russian language, because it's better than my English, the audioguide record was with a speech articulation disorder, and was really unpleasant to hear.  Had to switch to English and didn't understand everything, unfortunatelly"
 See the jewels,This is a cool and obviously very historically significant structure. The Highlight for me was seeing the crown jewels because they are so dang impressive. Also enjoy the great view of Tower Bridge on your way out. Make sure to have someone with you who can explain all the historical significance.
Great time to visit - and support a good cause,"This was the second weekend of opening after the COVID closure of summer 2020. We we able to book tickets a couple of days beforehand. Numbers are strictly controlled and this is probably a unique opportunity at any time of year to visit with just a hundred or so visitors within the Tower at any one time. Strongly recommended!Entry was very efficient - we arrived a few minutes early and went straight in - and there is a clear one wau route through the castle. Like most Londoners, I last went when I was ten, so it was great to see it again with more knowledge. I took my teenage daughter for her art project on armour and we spent a happy 90 minutes there - could easily have been longer. The smaller buildings are shut (but there is plenty to see outside), and the Crown Jewels and White Tower had plenty on show inside, including the beautiful Norman chapel. There were enough visitors inside the exhibitions that we felt more comfortable wearing masks - it is not compulsory. The ticket feels good value (and I'm now upgrading my ticket to membership so as to visit Kensigton and Hampton Court too). The beefeaters and guides have plenty of time to explain things to visitors - including the huge impact of COVID on the palaces' finances. If you can visit, it is both a unique time to do so, and a very good cause.One set of toilets is open, but there is no cafe or indoor seating open in the Tower (a takeaway kiosk would be useful), so take a snack and a drink. We ate afterwards, looking over the Thames and with a coffee from the little kiosk by the pier. Catering options in the immediate vicinity are pretty limited, particularly on a Sunday."
Awakening like Sleeping Beauty from the Lockdown,"Visiting the Tower of London was like visiting an old friend who had been asleep for several months. Booking online is essential and very easy as was arrival at the Tower.  Naturally, some of the interior spaces which involve climbing up and down narrow staircases are closed under current guidelines, but the Crown Jewels were open to see, as was two floors of the White Tower including the magnificent Norman chapel. The ravens are still here, as are the Beefeaters and other strange animals from the days when there was a zoo within the walls. The 954-year old Tower, with its variety of architecture over the centuries, was spookily quiet with relatively few visitors, which meant no queues, a pleasant change from what is normal in summer. There was a good selection from the Armoury to see in the  White Tower could be visited, including a luxurious revolver designed by Tiffany and other modern items. There are stunning views from the river walkway and a well-stocked shop that is worth visiting in its own right.   My only complaint is that there were no refreshments available, not even an ice cream stand, within the Tower itself, though there were several outside.  Hopefully, as time and experience develops, more of the internal spaces will be able to be opened up. All the staff, including the Beefeaters were friendly and helpful; it seemed that they had missed the engagement with visitors and were glad that the Tower was at last returning to some form of normality."
Fantastic family day out - Go before the crowds start to get overwhelming!,"What's fantastic experience, even though it's on our doorstop, I couldn't ever face the crowds (apparently up to 15,000 visitors a day), they opened their doors 2 weeks ago, and they only receive approx 800 people a day, which made it very comfortable. The Beefeaters were so lovely and incredibly knowledgable and so happy to chat and give you insight."
Amazing experience ,First chance to be a tourist in London following lockdown and what a great one.  It was very quiet and this allowed the staff to really take time and interact with you.  We have been before but this visit was just perfect.
The post-Covid visit ,"I have been here many times before,  but decided to come back yesterday for a post-lockdown day out. You can still get into the White Tower to see the suits of armour (Henry 8th’s codpiece is a thing to behold), and the Crown Jewels, but a lot of internal buildings are still closed off due to the virus. They aren’t doing beefeater tours either, but they are stationed about the courtyard to answer questions and take photos. My highlight was the ravens - they were quite vocal, which was a pleasant surprise!"
Brilliant,"One of the greats, it’s our history and it’s brilliant, well worth the visit if just for the history of not for the armoury and Crown Jewels."
Brilliant place to visit ,"Amazing place to visit, full of history and fascinating facts! Well worth a visit! Book ahead to avoid the queues"
good inworld,one shold see when you visit london think  your visit can not compllete with out seing name is tower  we know name is great
Tower of London!,Have been before but didn’t get the opportunity to go inside this time because of Covid but it’s really impressive from the outside. Will definitely be back!
Not for children under school age ,"I have to say, despite best efforts, I was a little disappointed here. The castle grounds were immaculate and the staff wonderful, however the entire experience was just so dull! I am a big lover of history, but this place was stuffy and boring, it’s not curated well and brought nothing to life. Nothing interactive whatsoever. Most rooms/parts were closed due to Covid, which is understandable so we could have missed something. If so, my apologies. I thought there might be interactive displays or video clips detailing the history or something to give the castle more context. Instead there were just dull text panels which are aimed at adults really. It’s a shame. This was my first visit to the place and I’ve lived in London all my life. Brought my 4 year old as he’s obsessed with castles, knights at the moment. He enjoyed seeing the armour. Also a note to say the way they have organised things in response to Covid is admirable, they’ve done a great job! If you haven’t been and always wanted to visit do so now as there were hardly any people and no crowds/queues at all."
Great place to visit,Its nice to have the Tower of London open again for the public. Its nice to be able to speak to the Yeomans once again. All the staff were great when asking questions about certain displays. It has a huge amount of history. The White Tower survived the Blitz of London of 1940.Will visit again before the Summer Holidays happen next month. Thank you.
Amazing ,"Very much enjoyed our trip to the Tower of London-our tour guide was very funny and had a lot of information to give us-he answered all our questions very well. Even though it was raining, it was a very enjoyable visit and lovely views over to the London Bridge. Great gift shop with a good range of stuff and a nice café to. Enjoyed the horse museum upstairs and also the walk around the walls."
A great attraction but much of it is closed.,This is a world class tourist attraction but due to Coronavirus many interesting parts of it are closed. You can still see the Crown Jewels and 2 floors of the White Tower. If you haven't been before or are not a member I wouldn't come at the moment.
Wonderful Beefeater led tour of history,I have been wanting to visit the Tower of London for many years but just never got round to it. Me and my boyfriend visited here for his slightly belated birthday treat. We joined one of the free tours and were very happy with it. Our Beefeater was funny and informative and I think slightly overran. He was very passionate about it. After the tour we wandered around visiting the Crown Jewels and was impressed by the collection and the innovative use of a travelator. We also did the tower. There is so much to do I’m not sure we did it all but we did upgrade to membership for the year as it was only £20 more to do so for a joint one. Well worth a trip!
a good day out,"This was my daughters choice for her birthday I wasn't sure I would enjoy it but it was amazing, I loved the role players, changing of the guards, history of the raven, the tower itself with it's sad stories.  I really would allow a day to see it all."
So much to see and do here,"This was a great way to spend a portion of our day. Start with the Beefeater tour to get some information about the history of the area. They're funny and give a lot of details in a short amount of time. There's a little bit of everything to be found here, especially if you find the medieval era, monarchy, armor, jewels, architecture, swords, churches, palaces, ravens, and amazing views interesting. It is easy to spend hours wandering around to all the different buildings and displays. For those with disabilities, there are stairs in several buildings so getting around will present some challenges."
Tower of London,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Best to join a tour (Beefeaters give a free guided tour of the Tower every 30 minutes) or read up to understand its history, the symbolism, how it was used (fortress, palace, prison) and the stories of what happened in the various areas of the property. The Crown Jewels exhibit is particularly popular, so the queue is long."
Lovely Historical Place In The City ,Went with my son and early January this year and we were very impressed with the architecture and the up-keeping of the tower plus the Royal jewellery that was in exhibition at the time. It was lovely to see the grounds are well managed m by the resident workers and was unchanged from when the Tower was occupied. We enjoyed meandering through the buildings and passage way. I’ve been here twice but still love it.
Spooky experience,"We went here a while ago so bit of a late review. But anyway we really enjoyed this. Absolutly brilliant. Obviously there is history and lots of things to see. Our favourite bit was the guy that was dressed as a Lord and was telling us how his mattress was made. We also got some great photo shots of the skyscrapers in the background, contesting the old of the towers with the modern of the city. One thing that's going to sound really weird is that one of our Party thought they felt a Ghostly presence. Sounds a bit crazy but in one of the rooms we were looking at an alter and then she smelt a rotting body and she had this overwhelming sense of dread. She freaked out and we had to Leave and she refused to return. Then we found out later that the exact spot she was standing next to was where someone was murdered.. Spooky?"
Interesting Historical Location,"This is an interesting and educational site to visit. There is something for adults and children. Recommend arriving early and purchasing tickets online. If you want to see the crown jewels, GO THERE FIRST! The lines tend to be long. It is worth taking the free large group tour of the site, then I suggest exploring on your own. I loved the ravens!!"
great place to visit,"I loved the history here. The staff is wonderful, informative, proffesional and helpful. There is something here for all people of all ages and all interests. The other guests were friendly and respectful. As an American I found it interesting to see a UK view on US/UK history."
Very informative tour,"We managed to visit just before the lockdown.  It was a very informative tour with Yeoman warder very jovial,and friendly.  We enjoyed seeing the Crown jewels afterwards with well organised queues.  We also very much enjoyed the lunch in the cafe.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience"
A lot of history,"This castle is great with the guides who live there and they give you free tours because they do it in good will they are great and funny.They tell you the history of London and the tower (more than they make you interpret what they tell) every place to and very good people, the crows are charismatic and pole in one of the towers and two people who interpret the day that the king had, etc.In question it is one of the best things that I have visited and although you are disabled you can go since there are tickets for people in wheelchairs and it is totally worth the price."
Arrive early ,"One of the MUST dos in London at least once, this place was a joy to explore. We took about 4 hours to feel like we explored enough of the grounds about 85%.  We really enjoyed the crown jewels. Truly breathtaking. Tip, arrive before opening to get in line. If you have an e ticket purchased through trip advisor or Get your Guide for example, you'll still need to line up in a separate line to obtain a physical ticket.They don't inform you until you're at the gate so beware. We waited in 3 separate lines before we finally got in to the right one with the right form of ticket. More signage could really avoid this. No photos of the crown jewels allowed but you can stay as long as you like. Again another pro tip, go straight to the crown jewels upon entering as a separate line will form quickly for that building alone."
Definitely worth a visit,If you love history this is for you plus you get to see genuine Beef Eaters and the Crows of course. I found this a very enjoyable visit. See where Anne Boleyn spent  her last days . History on tap. Good value for money . Would definitely recommend as a good day out.
must do,even as local this is one of our favourite spots to visit in London. we like history and vibe of this spot. Really one of must locations in London
Wonderful historical experience.,"Enjoyed visiting the tower last year, it was fascinating learning more about the history and seeing the various exhibits and parts of the tower. Look forward to visiting it again in the future."
History of London,"This prison has long history. There are many museum exhibits and there are also coronation jewels in the collections. There is also a history of the Tudor. In the former prison cells there are various inscriptions on the walls, it make goosebumps. And from the walls is nice view to Thems river and Tower bridge."
TOWER OF LONDON TOUR,"If there is a tour you must do while visiting London, it is this one! This tour had so much educational information and was so well explained that if felt like I was living in the actual time. Our tour guide is dressed like a knight and explains in detail everything about the castle. He walks you to the courtyard, the different rooms in the castle, all while explaining everything to you and interacting with you. He challenges you while you learn and makes everyone stay engaged. You will also see how they used to do the changing of the guards there AND you get to see the jewels used by the old kings and queens. It was totally worth it... takes no longer than 2 hours."
Perfect for all ages!,"Finally got around to writing a review! I visited the tower with my family back in February and although I had been to the tower many times as a child it was lovely to go back With my son and his friends for a birthday treat. We were standing around wondering where to start as it had been years since I had been, and everything looked so different. We saw a lady and I asked to take her picture the outfits are brilliant she introduced herself as Natalie, straight away she was friendly and made the kids take interest in the history of the castle. I asked if she minded showing us around and she was so lovely and agreed, the fact that Natalie kept the attention of the kids and us adults too with so much knowledge it was worth every penny. They particularly enjoyed the metal dragon which was huge and the creepy hand behind the glass. Natalie was extremely patient when they wanted to spend more time in certain areas, but I now feel I know so much more about the Tower than ever before and she smiled the whole time. We hope to return with more friends end of the year! for another tour. Great visit and thanks again to Natalie for keeping us all entertained."
A must visit place for first-timers in London,Privileged to be able to witness the Ceremony of the Keys. The Tower and its eerie history is amazing. Bought a 2for1 offer thru a website which effective gives you 2 admissions for the price of 1.
Great -- even in the rain,Always love going here. A must is the chapel tour where the go over the history. Not too long and good information.
Great experience,"I was privileged to see the Ceremony of the Keys, it was a moving experience, the Tower was amazing. Its a must see."
My day in London ,Brought my girlfriend to London. Went Tower of London. Had great time. Strange to live in London and never go to theses places . Would fully recommend it
Experience London history...,"A great place to learn about the history of London. There is a lot to check out! The best was the crown jewels, the white tower, etc. Be sure to be a bit early to beat the crowds if you want to check out the crown jewels. It might take a couple hours to check every things out, so allow yourself enough time. Also, the white tower has a lot of stairs, so beware. It's good exercise though, lol. The cafe was great to rest or grab a bite. The food was a little bit expensive but tasty. I would highly recommend this place if you are curious about the history of London."
Best Part of My Trip,"I loved the history that fairly oozes from this place. Lots of things to see and experience, you really need a whole day to explore it all. Grab lunch at the Hung, Drawn and Quartered when you're done, and a quick visit to All Hallows at the Tower after will round off the perfect day."
Totally worth it,Perfect historic addition to any London trip. Beautiful and inspiring specially if this is your hobby as a royal family conoisseur
good,"good for one visit no more, i think with  or hs is more than enought. Good to see how wealthy they are"
A haunted experience,"The Tower of London is full of ghosts and spooky feels.  A lot has happened there through the years and no matter how sensitive or not you are, it's impossible not to feel something.  If you want an extra spooky experience come dressed up in Renaissance clothes.  Everyone will think you're part of the place including the ghosts.  It's very interesting to walk in the steps of all the people who came to have their heads chopped off."
Fascinating,Fascinating tour with  Beefeater who was both funny and informative. You are free to browse after the tour has finished at your leisure. We went just before xmas where the grounds look even more special with Christmas trees in the grounds.
Great tour - Great historical facts,I enjoyed my visit at the Tower very much! The tour I attended was very insightful and I enjoyed learning about this interesting site of history. I spent about 2.5 hours here and I think it was worth to visit and the entrance fee. I would probably come back at some point to visit again.
Historic Fortress of the Tower of London,We joined a tour group led by a guide who injected many humorous remarks along with his version of historical facts. Educational and fun.
Thanksgiving holiday,"We enjoyed exploring London over Thanksgiving. The Christmas decorations were up so we enjoyed those at night. Tower of London was entertaining, we spent about 3 hours there including a great beefeater tour."
Must See!!!,The Crown Jewels are kept here and they are absolutely stunning. The line is long but moves fairly quickly. It's definitely worth the wait.
Good Day Out,"We had always wanted to visit the Tower of London, but never found the time on our many trips to the city. I would definitely recommend it, especially to history buffs. A word of advice: when you get in, head straight for a Beefeater Tour, then make straight for the Crown Jewels, before the lines get too long. The rest of the tower is very interesting and informative. Definitely pay a visit to the ravens. A good way to spend a day in London."
Interesting for history buffs! ,"We took note of all the advice to get in early and make straight for the jewels, then we spent some time doing things at our leisure, glad for the advice, as the lines just kept getting longer. Great tour and awesome history. Definitely recommend."
Tower of London with kids,It was great to see the ravens and the crown jewels.  There was a long queue to get in to see the jewels but no more than I would expect.  A nice variety of things to do on the grounds.  Fair range of food and drink but it's typical London sightseeing prices.
The Tower of London all day event,"I toured every aspect of this fascinating landmark in one day, guided by the extra purchase audio-guide and 2 Yeoman Warder personal tours of the Chapel and grounds.  The Yeoman Warders are retired British military who live on site with their families and have intimate knowledge of every aspect of the history of the Tower.  There are special events all year long which enhance the overall experience.  I found this experience to be a unique and not-to-be-missed part of the London experience.  I toured London for 14 days and consider The Tower of London to be the best event of this excellent trip. I highly recommend you plan to spend the entire day exploring this critical part of English history. Be sure to sign up for at least one Yeoman Warder guided tour. Entry into the Chapel is by guided tour only."
Beautiful castle ,"Who wouldn’t want to come here and explore the old prison and see the crown jewels? We came on Sunday afternoon what was but pity because we couldn’t enjoy their restaurant for too long as they close the castle quite early so we had to hurry to see everything. But as we have the membership card we will definitely come back. Inside you can see also the armours, prison, medieval dresses and have the audio guide who explain everything."
Awesome place,I spent like the whole day here! I was exhausted and hungry but it was great either way. Only thing was that the cafe was so slow! I stood in line for a single pop for 45 minutes...
Amazing,What can I say? I was impressed to find out so much information about this tower and what happened during the history here. From legends to real facts you will find out so many great things.
Bucket list place,"The first journey to London have to consist of checking out the monuments from postcards and movies, tasting the original cousine and having a chat with locals. As for the monuments we also visited the iconic Tower. Pretty spectacular and definitely not to be missed (but afterwards you won't forget it! ;))"
A Historical Delight,"My husband and I took a self-guided tour of the tower and got audio guides for a minimal fee. The place is enormous so plan to spend a couple of hours here if you choose to see all the buildings in the compound. The interior of the buildings are spectacular and the history attached to it are even more interesting to hear. The grounds are gorgeous and are well maintained. Not to be missed are the Crown Jewels which is absolutely breath taking. Photography is not allowed in the Crown Jewels but is allowed in most of the other buildings. Some of the buildings have steep, narrow staircases that may not be suitable for people with mobility issues. There are plenty of restrooms, gift shops and snack shops on the grounds. Take advantage of pictures with beefeaters and the guards outside the Crown Jewels."
Historical,Really cool and mysterious seeing all the jewels. Good for families and friends. Close to a subway and Ben & Jerry’s
Can't miss London site,The Tower of London is a great stop on  a London tour.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater Tour but skipped the Crown Jewels since we'd seen them on a previous trip.   We basically hit a few spots of interest for us after the Beefeater Tour and went on our way to the rest of London.   I think one can have a nice visit and get a feel for the tour in 2-3 hours.
Mohammed Arjomandkhah,We enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it to every one who is coming to london site seeing 👍 make sure you were comfortable shoes 👍
Amazing,I always had an interest about castles. And this building satisfied me most so far. This place is actually something as cool as Eiffel tower.
Superb,"I did the ceremony of the keys in the tower of London, a ceremony where the tower is locked up in the traditional way. This has been taking place for the past 750 years or so and happens late in the evening. I would clearly recommend trying to get a ticket for this, definitely a unique experience."
Bigger on the inside,"I had a TARDIS-like experience walking through the Tower of London.  This castle has a long history in London: a royal residence and palace, armoury, treasury, prison, and the home of the Crown Jewels.  Keep an eye out for the ravens, as they have a special place in the Tower, and the ghost of Anne Boleyn is said to haunt the Tower as well.  We spent an afternoon exploring everything here, and every time I turned, there was something else to explore here.  It could easily take an afternoon."
""" unforgettable""",Its an unforgettable experience that stays with you for a long time.  As soon as you walk through the grand gates you are transported back in time. Its not until you see the bustling traffic circling the tower you remember you are in modern day london.  There is so much to see and learn about the tower and all its history.  A great day out for all ages. Very helpful staff with a lot of knowledge about the tower and always happy to answer any questions. Great value for money.
More than what we expect,It was one of the attractions included in the London pass. We have no regret to visit it as it was more than what we expect. The historical site  is rather big and we spent an hours plus to just walked around. All the buildings were really well maintained and in its original shape. We actually just a small group of people where there was tour guide  explaining the history of the building. Very interesting. Worth the time we spent there.
Not what you expect,"Took the family here and was very disappointed. We were looking forward to admiring some panoramic views from the towers viewing platform. This is not the Tower you might imagine, and there’s no viewing platform. I think this should be more clearly stated on their website. Nice gift shop though. Toilets need improving."
Crown Jewels and more,"The ravens, meat eater guards, Crown Jewels, dungeon and tons more. Tons of stuff to do. Next to tower bridge too."
Incredible!,"I certainly did not expect to spend nearly 5 hours here, but I did! I was lucky enough to arrive through the gates right when a tour was starting, which I highly recommend (and funny!). It gives you a quick history lesson and a good ""lay of the land"" to go exploring on your own…"
how,wow What a great serial dont f with windows in the missing specimens west with cats east west extract Flow
Outstanding,"The Tower of London surpassed our expectations. We arrived around 10 and headed straight for the Crown Jewels, which are unbelievable. After that we joined a beefeater tour which was incredibly informative and funny. Take the time to see everything, and don't miss the altar, and…"
Beyond the expectation!,"It's highly suggested to visit the Tower early when people are not crowded.  The tower itself is amazing with great history. The place is very well designed with one way direction, you will not miss the things.  The highlight is the museum in which displays all the Monash…"
Lots to see,"Entry was 30 Pounds with 'voluntary contribution' that is automatically included in the price. It is a great layout, you entry through one door and then follow it all around to the end. Although they needed a better sign to see the main entry door as I almost missed it. The real jewels look great and it was really cool to be able to see them. The old crowns are are on display and as all the expensive stuff was removed from them they look really shabby and fake. The tower was not what I expected but it was good. I really enjoyed the jewels the most. There is a jewel gift shop tucked away but it is worth a look."
"Take a day if you want, or just go early and see the jewels","We visited the Tower of London twice because we didn't know it was part of a tour we were doing and we had purchased tickets for a different day already. It's a good thing we did. By the time we arrived with the tour, the line to see the Crown Jewels was more than 2 hours long. We spent that time going through the buildings. Beware: Sometimes there is no way out but to go on...and on and on and... However, when we went back the next time, we went early and got right in line for the jewel exhibit and only had a 30-minute wait. We don't have much interest in British royalty, but it was well worth it. Gorgeous!"
Must see historic place,Love this site. The Crown Jewels were very interesting. Make sure to look for the ravens too. The Beefeaters were very nice about you taking their pictures. Leave at least 2hr at the least to look around.
Symbolic,"probably the most Symbolic building in London welcoming the crown jewels, it is also a great historic castle in one of my favourite neighbourhood around london with St Paul cathedral, St Katharine dock's, tower bridge and not so far from the nice borough market or even spitafield market"
Amazing place to visit.,So much history.  Enjoyed walking through all the parts of the Tower of London on the self guided tour.
Long and needs some renewing,Even the most boring museum can make all interesting by audio and visual effects. Waiting that solution. Can be better. In other hand in there are all historical interesting things.
Could Spend a Whole Day,"Depending on your level of interest you could spend almost a full day wandering around. Recommend getting there when they open to be the crowds. If you do so, you can immediately go see the Crown Jewels without a crowd. Then retrace your steps back to the front to join a Beefeater Tour. They provide a good rounded introduction to the Tower --highly recommended. Once the tour is complete, take your time and explore the White Tower, Chapel, etc..."
You MUST do the Beefeater tour,"Being that we only had about 1.5 days in London before heading to Africa, we had limited time to pick what do to but WOW we are happy we chose that Tower. You can spend HOURS here if you have the Time but we managed to see a lot in about 2.5 hrs. The Beefeater tour, included in the price, is worth it; so much information and great British humor too! Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well! The grounds were beautiful and so many great places to grab pics! Don't miss out on this fantastic attraction: )"
Cool place,Pretty cool to see something historical in the city. Nice displays of armor the people wore back in the day. The Queens jewels are Located here and it was awesome to see
Truly historic,What a treat to be able to view so much history in one place.we were fortunate to be there when there were no lines and  not to feel rushed. We were on the hop on hop off bus that stop there so i5 was a perfect combination
Always wanted to see the crown jewels,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Tower , amazing history of our nation . The staff and yeoman guards were all very helpful and ready to keep you informed . Thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour .Only downside was the ill mannered yeoman with ginger beard and glasses ( you know who you are pal ) my wife asked him a simple question as to where the soldiers stayed while on duty at the tower .he answered that they stayed HERE to her as if she was stupid. My wife never mentioned this to me until later as she knows I wouldn’t have put up with his smart ass reply . Other than that it was a great visit."
Great visit.,Great for whole family. Interesting history and architecture. Well marked and easy to do without audio tour. Docents were helpful. Great view of Tower Bridge.
Cannot wait to visit again when we are allowed to!  just love history,Highly recommended easy to visit can and can be seen all in one day transport very accessible and if visitors coming to UK can pack many historical places into their holiday.
Refunded,"I just called the US number - 702 749-5744 to cancel our tour for Sunday, March 22nd.  The company had already initiated the refund before I even asked.  Try calling them again!"
Closed down without issuing refunds,"They closed due to the outbreak which I 100% understand, but they didn't give an option for a refund for the tickets. Instead, they said they would honor it for a year, or they would keep the money. For someone who was planning to visit from outside the country, this was very disappointing."
Self paced tour,"Fantastic opportunity to enjoy history and explore. Plan to do plenty of walking and stair climbing. You can join a group tour and stay in a crowd, or use the map and set your own direction and pace. There are shops and cafe's within the walls, so you could use your entire time if you like.  With several groups and private tours moving through, you would often wait or stand on the edge and listen if you wanted more information about a specific location. If you have difficulty getting around, this is not for you as there are many sights and areas that are only accessible by narrow stairs.  If you simply move slow and can do 20 stairs or so with a break after, then you can take your time and still get to see the vast amounts of history within the walls. The crown jewels are a no photo area for security reasons, but there are some beautiful views and plenty of open areas to pause and take it all in."
900 Years Of History ,So came here on a whime as my other plans were cancelled. Started off with Beefeater tour which was about 45 minutes. Worth taking. Then took two hours is to get around all the other exhibitions. I'm not overly fit so going up and down the White Tower was a little bit of a struggle but that's more my problem. Give it about 4 hour to get everything in.
A lot of history !!!,What a long standing piece of history all in one place. Had great time . Beefeater tour was great and informative. Went to see crown jewels first to beat crowds and then met with tour as they were starting. perfect timing. Enjoyed learning history. Did not care for the art piece where chopping block was. Not keeping with the history. It takes away with what happened. If you come to London. It all started here. You need to go.
Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London 3/2020. It was a fantastic day. There was so much to see. The guides we read recommended 3 hours to see everything. I was skeptical that we would be there that long because we usually get through these things quicker than the guides say, however we were there a full 3 hours because there was so much to see and it was so interesting. We started with the Yeoman Warder tour that took about 30-40 minutes. We almost skipped this but I am so glad we decided to do it. The Yeoman Warder (I do not remember his name) was so entertaining and funny, but most importantly, he gave us so much valuable information so that we really understood the significance of the things we were looking at. It added so much to our experience once we headed off to explore on our own."
A real must if you're in London for a holiday,"A great experience, to begin with. You'll spend at least a couple of hours, maybe even 3 if you go to every available room, courtyard or armory.Also, the audio guide is informative and entertaining, and even moving, from time to time. Fully recommended."
History at its finest,"I visited here in January and was very impressed with the location, the site, the staff. It's such an iconic part of the royal history of the UK that one should not go to London without at least one visit. We focused our visit on the Armoury and the Jewels; both these exhibits require time to review and think about. I will visit again some day and next time I will take the guided tour to get more information depth. One caution; the armoury requires a lot of walking and many stairs."
Expensive - but worth it!,"I didn't even want to take this tour when we arrived - but my wife and daughter did!  I'm so glad they insisted.  Everything was above excellent.  If you love history, this one that should not be missed"
Tower of London,This is a must see if you’re visiting London. Be sure to allow yourself at least several hours to roam through the complex which includes the Crown Jewels and an extensive display of armor. Take the guided tour with one of the ‘Beefeaters’ who are knowledgeable and spirited.
The ceremony of the keys,There is a two year waiting list to watch the ceremony of the keys which we did on the Monday night of Boris Johnson‘s statement about Coronavirus  and the closing of pubs restaurants and attractions we are glad we went there were 16 of us  apparently there should’ve been 50  the beefeater was very informative and friendly  this is done every evening and has only ever been missed once in the Second World War  it takes about an hour and walking round the Tower of London in the dark is very atmospheric it’s free of charge Book it and give it a go.
Terrific family adventure,"Again, if you love history, this is a must see stop.  The Beefeaters give a wonderful fact filled tour and discuss all those who were executed here and tell of the importance of ravens at the Tower."
Fantastic!,Amazing displays. The castle is wonderful. The Crown Jewels dazzling and set up so people can’t hog the displays. Great gift shop. Used the 2 for 1 rail tickets pass
Fun place to take kids,Historical and fun for kids. Plenty of restaurants around and easy transport means you can make a day out of it.
Fascinating historical tour,It takes all day and is tiring but what is displayed is fascinating and full of history. The Crown jewels and displays of regal clothes through the ages is great as is the whole tour in general.
Review of tower of london,"Wonderful historical site with multiple buildings. Allow a minimum of 3 hours to explore but ideally longer if you can.  Crown Jewels are stunning, changing of the guard is fun to watch and looking at all of the different genres of uniforms was very interesting.  A great day out for the family, more suitable for older children to appreciate all on offer."
Trip to London,"This place is phenomenal! The Crown Jewels are spectacular, and the tour was cool! The Yeoman was insightful yet at the same time funny!"
Get there early,"First off, the grounds around the Tower are gorgeous.  It's an amazing green space in the generally grey and concrete city of London.  Once you're inside, I recommend the Beefeater Tour.  It's free and gives you a bit of an overview of what's available.  I also recommend going for the Crown Jewels first, before the crowds get there.  This gives you a little more time to see what's going on.  Also there are some tamed ravens, that are very cool."
Fascinating!,"We recently toured the Tower and enjoyed it tremendously.  Our Beefeater, Clive, was informative and funny...he made the day for us!  There was so much we didn't know about the Tower of London and we spent nearly 3 hours there.  Visiting in March was ideal as I imagine the summer crowds must be intense.  The crown jewels and prison were highlights.  A must see in London."
Merry Ole England,This is a must see if visiting London. There's a great collection of original armor including two suits that belonged to King Henry VIII.
"Prison, Fortress, bit of a Jewel!","Have visited quite a few times over last 50 years and always find a new bit of information! This time wasn’t planned but nether the less very enjoyable. ( Corona virus put paid to Yorkshire visit!) Yeoman tours this time of year start every hour at half past the hour. Our Yeoman of the Guard Clive was on top form and be proud of your job we enjoyed your hour long talk. Already knew things about Tower and was pleasantly surprised to know a few more bits after Clive’s presentation. Didn’t do White Tower as did couple years ago and had changed then as a lot less armour in there think it’s gone to Leeds.Jewel House had altered their format and was much better for visitors to get excellent views. Do they hire that punch bowl out I wonder as you can get 144 bottles of wine in it! Lol perfect for a celebration bbq when this Corona Virus ceases!!!!Ravens were in form squawking around and flying in and out their pens. Visited Armouries Cafe loads of seats had tuna & cucumber sandwich which was a bit hard priced £3.95 tea was £2.20 and a scone with butter £2.20 was nice.Fusilier Museum,Torture Tower, Traitors Gate, Royal Mint worth a visit and spent around 4 hours there for just viewing those few things. So allow plenty of time if viewing everything. (Train ticket you can get buy 1 get 1 free still on offer. )"
Excellent,Had an excellent day at the Tower of London. Very good value for money and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend this.
More fun visiting out of season,Visited here on a cold February morning. Booked in adavnce (internet) and skipped the wait at the entrance. They opened at 10 o'clock (Monday in winter) and we made our way straight to visit the Crown Jewels and there was no line waiting to go in. Afterwards we went back to the entrance for the Beefeater's excellent guided tour to the Tower buildings and stories of famous personalities (included in entrance ticket price).   Later on we saw long lines waiting to view the Crown Jewels. I was surprised to discover that visiting when crowds are smaller is more fun.
Yeoman warder did great job,"I toured the Tower on a recent visit to London.  On the recommendation of my tour guide, I did one of the Beef Eater Warder tours.  Warder Scott Kelly (Kelley?) did my tour and he was great.  He shared a lot of history (most of it very grim, but that's the reality) but he also struck just the right tone in his approach.  Enjoyed the experience."
Fantastic walking through history,"Great day. John our beefeater tour guide was fab and informative. We spent 6 hours seeing everything. Fantastic buildings, history and displays. Film remembering the poppy installation was great. Cafe great. Brilliant to have water fountains on site to full water bottles, very handy! A*"
A must see attraction ,"We spent many hours here and quite a lot of time spent in the White Tower with all its armoury.  The Crown Jewels were dazzling and no photography allowed here.  We saw torture implements, graffiti from those locked up in the towers, the ravens and Yeomen.  A great experience and a UNESCO site too."
Wonderful history!,Loved the beefeater tour.  Watched changing of guard in the tower which was interesting.  Lots of armor.  Could walk around the top of the tower which offered lovely views of the inside and outside.
Tower of London,"A full day, there are tours unfortunately we only had short tour as it was wet our tour guide was really good, well worth the visit"
fantastic,"We spent the best part of the day here walking round all the towers and the crown jewels. I really enjoyed it andwas amazed by all the history. The only downside of it is if you have any mobilitily issues you would struggle with all the steps. i was blown away by the crown jewels and was a bit dissappointed that i could not take a photo for my memory box, but we had a fantastic day here and i will deffo be back."
Great day out!,Had a lovely time with my 3 and 5 year olds and Granny for moral support! My oldest loved the Knight school- great trip
Tower of London - Crown Jewels...cool - the Yeoman Warder Tour... AWESOME!,"Took family to see the Tower Of London. Went for the Crown Jewels but enjoyed touring the grounds and learning about the history even more. The entire family enjoyed the Yeoman Warder Tour the most though. If you visit the Tower, you absolutely have to do the Yeoman tour - you won't regret it! Also ate on the grounds at the restaurant and food was good and reasonably priced."
Enjoy Norman history!,"Well, how to get started?....you can approach this visit from many angles.....history enthusiasts will relish in seeing for themselves a prime example of Norman domination in Britain (Anglosaxons did not build castles, credit should be given to the Normans). If you do not know about this, I would very much encourage you to read about William the Conqueror before taking this tour and I guarantee you will enjoy your visit much more.You can also find enjoyment in hearing the stories about the many nobles, including Queens, who ""lost their heads"" right there, at Tower Hill. The Beefeater Tour is a great way to learn some of those stories, this tour should not be missed. You surely must know about the Crown jewels which, yes, you will be able to see during your visit. There's a surprise awaiting you in the chapel within the Tower compound....I will let you discover this for yourselves.By the way, as you exist the Tower of London, do visit a nearby church just about 100 yards away. It's called All Hallows by the Tower and it holds a true jewel inside it and a few other surprises. Do make sure you pay a visit to this church....just walk with eyes wide open to find these surprises. Enjoy!."
Great historical site!,"Very interesting piece of history! Definitely recommend! Lots of walking. If you are out of shape, go slow."
Fascinating day out,"A great day out - made special by the free yeoman of the guard guided tour. The tour we took was given by yeoman Scott Kelly, who was informative and very very funny."
Exploring history,Great piece of architecture with great history. The Tower of London rivaled St Paul’s Cathedral for the best site to see on our trip! The Tower of London is not to be missed. We were there over 2 Hours and could’ve went back through!
Definitely a Must Visit,"I'm not sure if I didn't research it enough or wasn't setting my expectations correctly, but our visit to the Tower of London was beyond expectation. I went into it thinking it was just the central tower building with artifacts in it. But in reality it was the ability to tour…"
HISTORIAL,"Tour guide Left us by the London of Tower which picked us up also.I felt that I was back in time, very excited with the Tower of London , it would rain then stop and again. many stairs going up and down, Crown Jewels and beefeater were even more amazing to see all their jewels…"
Birthday visit ,"The Tower Of London is always a pleasure to visit, and we always find something new that we've never seen before. It's quite a trek in some places, especially the White Tower which has over 200 steps, so if you have problems in that department it's going to be quite a struggle. Other than that it's a perfect place to discover England's troubled past monarchy, with help along the way from the trusty beefeaters. Well recommended."
Mr E Rhone,Hi had a brilliant tour with Spike he was very good and very entertaining. He kept the tour interesting
Thoroughly enjoyed Tower of London eurgh Scott Kelly.,"The larger than life,  Beefeater Scott Kelly made our day at Tower of London all the better. He's very funny,  loves a story and personifies what Beefeater should be. Top effort #409"
Nice Place to Visit ,If you go I highly recommend taking the time to join a free Beefeater tour. The stories and history from them make it much more interesting. The crown jewels are amazing. I was a little disappointed that none of the rooms in the living quarters part of the castle were kept original. It is all military and weapons displays now.
Great place to go for history ,"Great visit enjoyed the history, fantastic especially for foreign visitors to learn about London. Cafes and shops on site, toilets clearly signed. Can get great photos in front of the guards outside where the Crown Jewels are."
Awesome,Great piece of architecture with great history. Its must visit in london. Often rated as top attraction of london.
Interestjng,The history and location of this attraction were the most fascinating aspects! You learn about the animals the castle used to house as well as the prisoners and raids the area experienced over time. It’s so cool to walk through this historical landmark while also seeing modern buildings such as the shard and gherkin. Highly recommend!
Interesting,"We didn't have the option for a beef eater tour unfortunately, they must not have done it the day I went. But it was still very interesting and alot more to see than you'd realize! Also great view of Tower Bridge"
A walk through history - truly amazing,"At first I  thought the ticket price was steep especially given the Australian exchange rate, however it was worth every penny, or pounds It was very cool to see the actual Crown Jewels and stand in a room occupied by Henry Viii. So many exhibits on display, the armoury in the white tower was impressive. I would allocate half a day to fully explore the whole buildings and grounds."
Top tourist location,"Allow yourself at least three hours as there is so much to see. A 45 minute yeoman warder tour is a great way to get an overview and then see the Crown jewels, the White Tower and a lot more."
Highlight of our visit!,The Tower of London rivaled St Paul’s Cathedral for the best site to see on our trip! The Tower of London is not to be missed. We were there over 2 Hours and could’ve went back through!
Exploring history,"Having watched the tv show, I wanted to see the Tower for myself. We had a wonderful time seeing and experiencing centuries of history for ourselves. We had a tour with Tower Warden Clive (he said to say his name was Phil if we didn’t enjoy it 😂) and despite him struggling with a cough, not Corvid-19 as he was keen to assure us; was loud, entertaining and knowledgable. Get well soon sir, and thank you for this morning. Well worth a visit."
"Beautiful history steeped buildings, Go VISIT","What a great afternoon, despite the constant rain we decided to visit here and did not regret it. The tour was unfortunatly cut short to half an hour but was fascinating with a great Yeoman guard as our guide. We learnt so much, the Crown Jewels are astonishing and there are many crowns and sceptres, I thought just one but no. There is a really nice, but pricey cafe/restaurant and the White Tower displays the armoury. The grounds are lovely and you can walk around the battlements, it is a great place for families or couples to spend several hours reliving our English heritage."
A great way to spend a morning,"Living only a couple of hours from London i is a crime how little I have seen of my countries capital, having spent a weekend here we had to choose one 'big' attraction to do and plumped for the Tower of London, I won't lie I was sceptical and at just under £50.00 for the two of us that was part of it.I couldn't have been more wrong as soon as we got in we jumped on the Yeoman Warders tour and yes it is rehearsed by the delivery is excellent the humour for everyone and our guide held the 40+ people in the palm of his hand.  A fantastic 45minutes or so and worth the admission alone.If you do the tour first you are then free to explore at your will, everything is presented excellently and there is so much to see that you can easily spend most of the day here if you take it leisurely.  The highlights are the Crown Jewels and The White Tower both of which are presented in a way that shows off their importance.This is a must see for anyone coming to London, especially if you just think there is going to be just a tower, there is so much more."
Really helpful staff,"Thankyou to the first aiders who came to help me after my fall on Saturday 7th March, approx 4.00pm. I was on a coach trip to the tower of London yesterday and what a lovely day out. Thankyou again for the beefeaters that came to my rescue. Tina birch, Nottingham."
So much history in one place,Enjoyed a great half day at the Tower although I feel I should have planned on more time as there was so much to see. Great guided tour by Simon the Beefeater. He really brought history alive with his unique and humorous narratives. The Crown Jewels were breathtaking - so much gold!

Behind the walls of history ,"So much history behind the walls of the London Tower. There are so many different areas that you can go in visit. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see in person. There are tickets booths all over the place for this place, if you’re a student remember your student card you get a discount!"
The guided tour is the best!,Learned so much from the guided tour. So much history all in one place! Beautiful views across the river from the wall around the tower.
A must watch place,The kids would resonate with the rhyme of London bridge is falling down.Do take the river ride on Thames Clippers
"A ""Must"" place to visit","Anwone who had studied English history should visit this Tower and the nearby Bridge.  You can see the Royal jewels, the dungeons, the living quarters, the gardems and the walls all around this castle.  the stories are endless, the explanations good, the scenery great, and the experience really special.  i highly recommend a visit here.  it's also on the Londond pass."
Way TOOOOO Much to see if you think it is only One Tower!,"I thought the Tower of London was ONE tower.  But it encompasses a day's worth of interesting and fascinating ""towers"" that will keep you interested for hours!  The crown jewels was interesting, and there's so much to see.  Start early, and there's places for snacks/light meals if you need."
Must visit,"This is one of the most visited sites world wide not only in London , to make the most of your visit to understand the history you either join a tour or take the Audio guide and thats what I have done ,using the audio guide will help you understand the history with no rush of the tour, the rich history of this site is over whelming , and you will get the chance to see the royal jewellery there. This place will take between 2 hours and 4 hours of your time ( 4 hours if you want to go deeper in the history side as this castle was the home of many kings and queens ). Best time to visit early morning"
Nice day out,"Got there early just in time for the army to do their yearly happy birthday firing of the cannons for prince Charles. Definitely a good sight to see.Tours inside are great, very helpful staff.The sights are amazing!"
A lot to offer for such a small castle,"The Crown Jewels need no further introduction. The amazing royal regalia needs a very long queue to enter, we waited for about 45 minutes. I have visited the Diamond Fund in Moscow, and this is a little disappointing. Everyone rides on a travelator to see the Crown Jewels, and all you get is a few seconds glimpse.The other parts of the palace was equally interesting, we had underestimated the potential of the castle grounds as a museum, and missed many other exhibits. As the one of the oldest palaces of the UK, it offers great insight to the history of the castle. Just like its sister Hampton Court Palace, a full day's visit would be recommended."
Great visit,"Really looking forward to this visit and I wasn’t disappointed, knowledgable staff and fascinating history!"
Fantastic,The tower of London is fascinating and a fantastic way to spend a few hours. The history of the place is awesome. The Crown jewels are amazing and are a must see for any sightseer. Some of the history is sad and some is good. Well worth a look.
Old,Loved this part of trip. Beside the jewels (which are worth the price alone) the tower itself was was inspiring. Great wardens tour comes with it.
Interesting but slightly pricey,"The tour of the Tower of London was quite interesting, especially since we got to hear about a lot of fun facts from one of the yeoman warders. The tickets were slightly more than I would have wanted to pay but seeing the crown jewels was definitely a wonderful experience!"
Incredible....,"Tower of London was probably one of our family’s favourite days on our recent trip to London.  It was rainy, so the Beefeater tour was held in the church, but it was still very interesting.  We visited the Crown Jewels first - there was no crowd so we had as much time as we wanted.  The Jewels are absolutely incredible - a must see.  The kids really enjoyed the White Tower and I thought it was a good place for them to learn some local history while in vacation."
Fascinating Visit,Thoroughly enjoyed exploring the Tower despite the wet weather. There's plenty to see. The Crown Jewels were amazing. The Armouries incredible to see. All areas were clean and well presented. Information boards were succinct and to the point and not too wordy. Great for children and school parties.
WOW!,"Pre purchased tickets that were at will call, no lines when we visited.Pros:  Get the guide tour head phones as it provides lots of insights. Make sure you circle back to view from both sides of the Crown Jewels."
Beautiful crown jewels!,Our visit to the tower of London was actually too short. We did the Shard in the morning and tower of London in the afternoon. Doable but we wished to have more time to see it all.
Sensory overload.,"Overwhelming, history around every corner. The beefeaters are very knowledgeable, and hilarious, a must see."
"Crown Jewels, and much more","Although in theory you are looking at a stolen artifact, the display of Kohinoor and other crown jewels are quite good to attend. On its the old castle can be travelled in a fair speed, however, takling a tour is recommended as there are some areas where tour party only can go through"
Worth a visit,We had a wonderful day visiting the Tower.  There is so much to see and do.  I would recommend getting the boat to the attraction.
Tower of London trip,Very lovely and enjoyable visit. Quite expensive but u are there for a few hours so it's worth the price. Lots to look at .
Beautiful day out,"Brilliant day at the Tower of London. Beefeater tour, Crown Jewels and all the different exhibitions and the battlements we very interesting and informative. Something for all ages."
Well worth the time and money!,"I just wasn’t sure about the price but very glad I made the time to go.So much to see, plan on spending the day."
Always a blast to go to the London Tower,We have been several times over the years and William the Conqueror's castle is always a treat. The castle itself or the Crown Jewels but there is always interactive activities going on. Men dressed in costume and acting out various parts of its long history. Great kids activities over school breaks.  Just lots of fun
A must see!,What a marvelous tour we had. Try to get Lawrence has your Yeoman (guide) and ask him about his costume🤪. First time in London and this was a family favorite.
"Dave, Yeoman Warder, was amazing!","Dave gave us the best introduction to Tower of London! He was really informative and entertaining. We spent two hours exploring. The Crown Jewels was a highlight but the full history was fascinating. And, yes Dave, I thought there was only 1 tower."
Better than I expected,"We visited and were pleasantly surprised.  I would add this to a do not miss thing to do in London.  We did not have a lot of time and spent about 2.5 hours visiting, but I feel like we could have spent more time to really see everything.  I would definitely go on the Beefeater Tour when visiting."
The Tower of London full of history a must visit when in London,"First visit for my wife after pestering her for a month before visitng london. She was absolutely bowled over by the displays, Beefeater Tour was informative unfortunately was the wet tour due to the weather,We spent 5 hours in Tower of London and Crown jewel's and can honestly say we could have spent another 3hrs and still don't think we seen everything."
"Lovley, would do it all again.","We went on the 2nd of march, we started with the beefeater tour. The ginger bearded tour guide stated before he started that it was about the history of the tower and there would be some gory parts to the tour. He was very engaging, informative and loud enough for everyone to hear. It was great fun and I would love to take some of the younger family members. I was surprised to hear that people had been complaining on trip advisor about how gory the history is so i just wanted to counter that by saying that is the point of going to learn it all and our guide was fantastic."
Lots and lots to see,There was so much to see at the Tower of London we wished that we had had more time to see it all.  The Crown Jewels were beautiful but standing in line for an hour was not fun.
Always Worth It!,"This was probably my 10th visit to the Tower, but it’s always the first stop when I bring friends to London.  The Tower just never disappoints — 1000 years of history in one spot!  This time we met the Raven Master, which was a special treat.  The Crown Jewels are always brilliant, and I love the addition of animal sculptures that are in tribute to the old Menagerie.  The history of the Tower is so fascinating — I never run out of info to share with my friends.  Once again, an impressive first day in London!"
Jewels!,"If the only thing you go see is the Crown Jewels that alone is worth the trip to the Tower of London! Its pretty amazing...the only thing I would have skipped was the Bloody Tower...too many stairs for very little info, but if you have the energy go for it. But do not miss this treasure of London!"
Amazing history,Great place but tickets way over priced for qhat it is.My little boy has been desperate to visit the Tower of London and especially the Crown Jewels. It did not disappoint. The Yeoman tour was brilliant and gave really interesting historical facts. My son loved becoming a knight at knight school.Great day out overall but way too expensive.
The best attraction in London,This is the one thing I would not want to miss in London.  We spent a half day here and we could have used more time.  There is so much to see and to learn.  Definitely take one of the walking tours included in the ticket price.
Queer lives matter too!,I saw the special tour discussing LGBT lives at the tower was coinciding with my Trip to London and knew I just had to go. I took my sister with me (who had been living in London for sometime but had never gone into the Tower). It was fantastically well organised and a lot of fun. Plus it was a truly magical experience to see the tower at night in a more intimate setting. It was fascinating to hear about the sodomy laws and the effect these laws had on everyone from the crown down and the tribute at the end was touching!
So much history in one place. Amazing,Loved all the history and the freedom to walk around as you chose in this beautiful historical site. We went on a rainy day so the Beefeater tour was very short.  I think on a nicer day it would have been better. Beautiful!
Interesting but not worth the expense,"I'd been to the Tower years ago traveling alone. I thought that bringing my kids would be a great way to introduce them to the city. For the cost of the tickets, it was a silly choice. The grounds are beautiful but for as much as there is to the place, there isn't much to see. Spend your money elsewhere or visit a free museum."
crown jewels are amazing,"just managed to catch a beefeater tour which was very jolly and informative, the crown jewels are way better than I expected (!) beautiful and the moving walkway was a great way to view them without hoards of children blocking the view!  walked around the walls and went in the White Tower--all excellent, seemed expensive at first, but lots to do.  Cafe food good."
London tower,Amazing to walk into such a historic place. I recommend to go early when they open and enjoy the grounds before it becomes overwhelming with crowds of tourists. The yeoman guard tour is a must. And the Crown Jewels is a nice close up but if royalty.
