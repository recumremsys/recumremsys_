Brilliant park,Great for walk with or without the dog... or a run but watch out for the golf course slap bang in the middle.... pretend you're Bruce Waynein Batman Begins as Woolaton Hall was his house
Beautiful deer park and gardens,"Opening/closing times change through the year so check the website, but this is my favourite place to run and walk round. A small charge for the car park but a fab children's play area, nice cafe in the stable block, the Industrial Museum is brilliant to visit but again check opening times, the Arkwright Society sometimes have Steaming Days. Formal gardens aren't open at the moment but a lovely stroll down to the lakeside is just a perfect way to relax."
Woolly Park - Always a fave!,"Since I was a kid, we have always enjoyed Wollaton Park (Wooly Park), great for walks, play areas for kids and the halls is always interesting. Yes a must see for those visiting Nottingham."
Stunning,Easy to park using the app - no problem hereThe Building looks amazing and evidently was used to film the Batman moviesWonderful views Deer wonder around freely Just needs a cafe near the building with a shop selling batman stuff
Beautiful oasis of green and history,Had some time to kill prior to a business meeting so filled the signs. A beautiful well kept location for a lovely walk down to the lake.The main house was very interesting and free to enter with some very unusual collections.A great find.
Gorgeous Park,Wollaton Park is a lovely location for a picnic or stroll around with family or friends. There is plenty to explore with plenty of space to sit down and admire the surroundings. Deer were also wandering around which added to our picnic out.

Excellent visit apart from car parking payment system.,"We visited on a hot sunny day to enjoy the beautiful Hall grounds.However, like many other visitors, we nearly turned away because of the car parking payment system.Most people do not have the app.and therefore have to make the long walk to pay by card at the shop and then return to display the ticket. After wasting nearly twenty minutes we did enjoy our walk, seeing many birds and deer with views of the Hall and grounds an added pleasure."
Beautiful Building !!,I go to visit this place at least once a year - there is always something new to see or do - This is the first time I have been this year and didnt have time tomvisit the halls just the gardens and get some air - looking forward to the light show going to be held later in the year!!
An Indian summer,Temperatures in the mid 20s n one of the best parks in the country made for a perfect day out. The view from the formal gardens towards the lake was enhanced by the trees starting to show off their autumn colours of reds and gold. The only thing missing was a butler to serve a cream tea while you drank in the view
First visit marred by parking system/fee,"Fabulous place to visit, the grounds and gardens that we did see on our recent visit were wonderful.   The building itself is beautiful and looks to be well maintained.   We arrived late afternoon and stayed until sunset.   Two huge stags wandered into the car park, not in the least deterred by families, which was lovely to see.   We will definitely go back.One gripe, however, and that is the car parking fee.    The fee is payed by telephoning a number, providing details of your car registration and paying by card.    This instantly excludes anyone who does not have a mobile phone with them or uses debit cards, such as elderly, who choose not to have one!    The second one is pronunciation of numbers and letters - my daughter tried to register her car and it misunderstood her B/D so when we walked back to the car having spent several minutes both walking to and from, and registering two cars, she had a ticket on her windscreen!!    Apparently, she was allowed 7 minutes to walk up to the ticket machine, register, and walk back - whilst accompanying a very slow mum (me).    My car displayed my blue badge and I thankfully didn’t have a ticket.    Take note visitors, especially elderly technophobes, slow walkers etc., this system is not user friendly ..."
Day trip out,Nice place for a wander round the lake and a visit of the hallTake a picnic and enjoy the fresh air
Great day out,"Popped in for a day out while we’re away nearby. Incredible grounds, extremely well kept, amazing inside the hall seeing all the taxidermy. Corvid measures all in place, what an amazing day out!"
Special park,"A walk through Wollaton Park is always a treat, marvellous grounds with several paths to explore, a walk around the lake to see the wildlife and plenty of it, cafe and shop open with social distancing in place all worth a visit, even saw some deer."
Nice outing,"Lovely walk around the park, grounds well maintained and people aware of others. Weather was great and the kids loved playing on the grass"
Lovely for walks,"We have visited on many occasions. It really is a change of scenery to do a daily walk here. Also it is lovely to see the deer roaming freely. Due to Covid, alot of its attractions were still closed but lots of people had set up their own blankets and bought food along. Also there were food stalls open, such as a mobile coffee shop and icecream van around. Parking is paid for which is annoying as if you have forgotten change you have to pay online which is time consuming. Parking around the side streets is even worse, neighbour watch call the police (PSCO) to warn drivers or record your reg as your vehicle is 'unfamiliar'."
Nice morning out,Its exactly a yw=ear today that we last visited here with our grandsons. Parked ok and close to the play area. The boys spent 90 mins in the play area and really enjoyed it. We sat on our chairs keeping an eye on them. Toilets are close by and very clean. Also a café doing takeaway drinks etc. Some selfish and disrespectful person had let their dog do its duty and not cleaned it up and a lady near us had trod in it. A nice morning out and we will return
big park,nice park with a big house and dear. lots of space and different places to walk good time had by all
Beautiful gardens,"We had a wonderful day out with our children (7 and 10), free to enter, dog friendly and a brilliant playground (and small fair)."
Nice socially-spaced place to walk,"Parking is £3 for two hours or £5 for all day.  It's a large and varied outdoor space which despite there being hundreds of cars means there's plenty to explore without being amongst crowds, and you can walk and maintain social distance from strangers which is all-important at the moment.Seeing deer in the designated areas was a great experience."
Parking nightmare,Recently visited Wollaton park NottinghamGreat walks around park and lakeHall was closedMajor problem with parkingMyself and many others could not pay for parking due to the telephone payment system not workingWe were told by various people that this happens all the time and we were advised to buy a ticket from the cafeThis cafe was quite a distance awayHad to walk all the way there and back to car to display ticketMany people didn't bother and I don't blame themDespite the nice walk we had I left feeling disappointed and felt upset by this ridiculous systemI shall not be returning
Amazing,Wow what can I say amazing the deer come so close to you and the cars its amazing a great day out get there well worth it
Magnificent,We visited this place just after lifting of lockdown restrictions. We could only access the gardens. There were a lot of families around. This is an ideal place to spend the afternoon. I would definitely come back again when the place is fully open.
Love it,"Wollaton Hall is a magnificent Elizabethan house, designed by Robert Smythson, set in a 48 acre deer park with classical stable block housing the industrial museum and cafe.  The house (1585) has numerous (very early) classical details. The cast iron structure camellia house predates the Crystal Palace by over 70 years and is best visited in early spring.Entry to the park is free though parking costs £3 (2020).Food in the cafe is a bit ‘municipal:’ adequate but could be so much better with a little ambition, thought and effort.There is a fenced children’s play area near the car park.The car park can get very crowded at weekends and bank holidays.Overall, the park is charming. The best time to visit is on a frosty autumnal morning."
Wayne manor ,My love of Batman brought me here and I was not disappointed! The beautiful building the stunning grounds. Everything was truly amazing. We sadly missed the tour but after speaking to an amazing worker we got a private tour of the building. We got so much more information and shown the most beautiful rooms and sites. I will visit again for sure it was 100% worth the trip. And made a Batman fan very happy.
Day out,"This park, in my view has got to be the best hall &&park in Nottingham. Whichever direction you take a picture of the hall, it takes a good picture. The walks are all great. The courtyard cafe is open, & the toilets, fantastic."
Great to be here again,We're starting to get out now to parks around our area. It was good to come back to the open spaces of Wollaton Park. We went in the morning but there were still quite a few people here - not enough to cause any problems with distancing. There's plenty of space to walk besides along the paths. We went around the lake and that got a bit tight in places but still OK most people were considering others.There were nesting birds and chicks in the lake area - great to see something normal.The web site did say that the cafe kiosk and toilets would be open in the courtyard but they weren't. There was an ice cream van and catering trailer though. We didn't go down to the play area to look there.
Great Park,"A great park and lake, can't wait for the hall and better still the industrial museum to re-open. This is a real gem and so close to the city centre.It is great for a leisurely stroll, or relaxing on the hill and a stroll around the lake is another bonus."
Depends what interests you,"The hall looks lovely, it's full of taxidermy animals so once you've seen one floor you've basically seen it all. There is at least one of every animal to every of existed in there, there's everything from insects, to a full grown giraffe. I didn't realise it was a National History Museum as we didn't actually plan to go here, we jut popped in on passing so it wasn't really my cup of tea, however if taxidermy interests you then this place has plenty of it. Coffee shop was lovely, with plenty of pooches in there too!"
Weird Hall,Strange place full of colourful gargoyles in the main hall and loads of stuffed animals.  Won't take you very long to see everything.
A nice afternoon out ,Nice grounds to walk around for some fresh air. The museum/hall is worth a wonder around (although it doesn’t take long).
Love it !,"What a great place to visit ! Been here hundreds of times when I was little and now I bring my 2 year old quite often ! He loves the park and a good run around looking for deer and other animals! Inside the museum it’s lovely, looking and explaining all the different animal to my son.Also the cafe is lovely ! Fantastic place to visit if your in Nottingham :) Great also for wheelchair users and pushchairs as they have a lift 😄"
Stunning place,I would recommend a visit to this beautiful place in the summer. Great for the kids with its abundance of playing areas. Plenty parking on site. Great place for casual walking.
Glad it’s being kept open! ,A damp day lead us here as inside and we enjoyed our visit. Did some geocaching which was great to find here. Somehow didn’t manage to see any deer! Industrial museum closed on Tuesday March 3rd and the cafe was full. Lovely building. Thought £10 a head for a tour was a bit much but probably very good from the little bit we heard in passing a group and you would get access to some parts others can’t reach! Well worth paying the parking and you could be here a long time if walking the estate.
Summer day out ,It great place summer time to visit lots lake walking best go there with good weather there have cafe etc it nice
Great place to visit,Hidden gem within Nottingham suburbs. Lovely deer park and a great place to visit. The hall itself is a lovely museum
Absolute must-see when in Nottingham,"The Hall building looks as good as it is on the pictures, maybe even better. Just a walk outside is nice if you are lucky with the weather; but also inside is a moderately-sized museum with beautiful interior and a great animal collection. There is a souvenir shop and bathrooms, but the overpriced coffee is no good"
"Lovely walk, lots of wildlife ","Lovely place to go for a long or short walk. Plenty of parking. £3 for 3 hours of a fiver for the full day. Plenty to see in the house and industrial museum. The cafe had lots of vegan options too, at least 3 cakes and a falafel roll. I’ll definitely be returning in the summer."
Great for families and dogs...,"...neither of which I have! But the place was packed full of happy families and plenty of 4 legged friends. Always enjoy our walks around here. Park on the road outside too if you can, avoid the charge!"
Walk and de-stress,"Walk and breathe in this park. See the ducks, bird, and if the time is right, you will find deer. See the benches and the people whom they were dedicated to. They loved the park, and I'm sure you will love it too. I did."
Lovely ,"Lovely day out with family, especially if the weather is nice! Also get to spot loads of deers if you’re lucky!"
Fantastic place ,"A lovely house, much better than I was expecting. The house is well worth a visit, the natural history part of the displays was very different. The courtyard with cafes and shops is better than most similar places. Don’t miss the grounds which are excellent and well worth a walk round. Most places like this would cost quite a lot to visit but this is excellent value for money, visit cost just £5 for parking."
Value day out!,We visited today and because one of our party had a blue badge we were able to park right at the top of the car park and it was free. I did see a few cars without blue badges occupying disabled spaces so it goes without saying that these people are the dregs of society. Maybe nobody checks the tickets here and people know they are able to get away with it?  Anyway it's a fiver to park normally and i think that's a bargain when the hall is free and the grounds are free to walk around. There is also a play area. The hall itself felt a bit ragged inside but the natural history element to it was really interesting to look around. The hall is on two floors also and there are lifts. There is a gift shop too. The grounds are ok to walk around and will blow away a few cobwebs. Cafe excellent too. All in all a very enjoyable visit and superb value for money.
Fantastic,"Wonderful park, with deer and fallow deer free to roam among the people, easy to approach, without being disturbed. Breathtaking landscape."
Amazing place! Go and visit.,We had a WONDERFUL visit to Wollaton Hall. It is free to enter and £10 pp for the house tour. The house tour was fantastic. Our guide was called Jay who was great.We went up to the roof and down to the cellars.  The place is very atmospheric and haunted!Beautiful decoration and well worth a visit!It's also worth mentioning that they also have a lovely gift shop and cafe in the stable block too.
A suprising amount of taxidermy,"A lovely place to spend a day walking around, visiting the gardens and the industrial museum is very close nearby. The house contains a surprising amount of taxidermy. Like even though I'm saying its surprising here you will go there and think ""this is a surprising amount of taxidermy"""
Love this place,"Friendly staff, great exhibits, nice coffee and cakes and lovely grounds for a picnic or walks. Also good play area for younger children. Went with friends and had a picnic in the gardens after  walking around the hall."
Batman must see,"Love all Wollaton ages, but few days ago realised: Batman was here!!! if U LOVE DC u definitely come and see that castle. is amazing to watching place when your heroes was walking <3Also all park is amazing place to have contact with nature and animals close to u. also lake is amazing :D"
Gorgeous scenery ,Love going to this park for long walks and looking at the deers. This park is huge with  beautiful manicured gardens and walkways. Great for picnics in summer.
Beautiful place....,A great place to spend the whole day if you wish...So much to see and do.Walk around the park&the hall..So much to see and do...Pay and display parking&entrance fee to the hall but all good value...
Historic house and Natural History ,"Visited here on a wet and cold January day, this precluded me spending much time in the park area looking for deer, which was a pity. Also the industrial museum which was a major draw to me was closed as well. The house itself is worth visiting, although only one room was displayed in a way you may traditionally expect. The vast bulk of the house is turned over to a very old skool natural history style museum. There’s a big collection from giraffes to insects and fish as well as geological exhibits. I couldn’t say it was organised particularly logically, note there are opportunities for younger visitors to interact and play. The historic glasshouse with its music based on the plants within is also worth a look. Entrance  to be fair is gratis, so one shouldn’t be too critical. Worth a visit, I wouldn’t return though unless I could enjoy the industrial museum and the grounds."
Lovely building,"What a beautiful building, so amazing to look at. Its a shame that the museum inside is looking quite run down. Would most definitely visit again in the future if they do some refurb work though."
"Will absolutely be going again, lovely place ","Visited today with my partner and 14 month old, who's is desperately trying to walk but can't manage it yet (we need place to go at the moment where she can crawl around in relative safety).The museum was perfect - large rooms with lots of exhibits she could crawl to, some small tables for her to pull herself up on, and cabinets full of interesting items; even though there were no specific activities for her, she was thoroughly entertained. The staff let us leave our pushchair by the door and the baby change was clean and easy to access.The only reason I'm giving a 4 star review is the cafe on the courtyard was a bit disappointing. They didn't serve hot food from their menu (other than toast and teacakes) until noon, which seemed bizarre given some of the things were breakfast items. Also, the cake was a bit sad. However, there were plenty of highchairs, a microwave to warm baby food and the coffee was decent.The grounds are lovely with plenty of accessible paths for pushchairs. We didn't venture into the deer park but that looked a lot more uneven, so we'll maybe need a baby carrier (or a walking baby!) for that area.Good parking (£3 for 3 hours, £5 all day) and a MASSIVE play park at the other end of the grounds also looked dead popular with families.We will definitely go again."
Fab day out,"It was so sunny on the day we visited even in March. Came over from Ireland for the weekend and didn’t want to spend it allWandering around the city . So easy to hopOn the bus and go there . It was a lovely walk around , a little skull around the house and a lie down on the hill. It topped the weekend off for us ."
Beautiful walks aroung the grounds in the heart of the city,"Although the interior of the hall is looking tired and the museum itself is well, poor, its grounds, lake, deer park and the grand building itself provide a lovely day out.Even on a cold but bright January Sunday, the amount of visitors there many of whom from overseas show its lasting popularity.I belive its Nottingham City Council owned, if so they need to sort the halls interior out and employe more staff in the cafe because they can't cope when demand is high, apart from these points, lovely place."
Great hall and gardens right near Nottingham,"Deer, a lake, nice walking tracks and a few rooms you can visit in the hall. Worth a walk. Most things are free"
Elizabethan mansion with quaint museum inside,"Even on a rainy day, Wollaton Hall stood out as an imposing Elizabethan mansion that dominated the surrounding country from its hilltop. I was surprised to see that it had been converted into a museum of natural history (rather than, say, a National Trust property or a hotel). Entry was free of charge and inside we found a quaint, old-fashioned museum, with creatures of all kinds mingled in the display cases. My wife is disabled and the staff were very helpful with the wheelchair lift and access. I recommend Wollaton Hall to anyone who is visiting the Derby/ Nottingham area."
Interesting,"We did a Google search for local attractions, and Wollaton Hall came up. Beautiful parkland, plenty of parking (£3). As the house is set on top of a hill, there is some walking up slopes and steps, nothing too strenuous, but take care if its wet!! The hall has a varied collection of stuffed animals including a giraffe and a gorilla, and a lot of animal skeletons. There is also a good collection of fossils and stones. To be honest, it was a bit sparse but all the same quite interesting. As it was free to get in.... No complaints! There is also a museum (extra cost) and a couple of gift shops. The grounds are extensive with a beautiful lake to walk around. All in all a lovely morning spent in a beautiful setting."
Really Good Family Day Out,"What a nice place for a picnic, we took our grandchildren for day here, large playground with lots of activities, we then took a walk upto the main house which is freey entrance and has full disabled facilities it also quite a large natural history exhibition with lots of dinosaur bones the kids loved. Large deer park to roam about be careful of rutting season though. Great day out."
Something for everyone. ,"I have been coming here since I was a boy and also brought my children here. Beautiful gardens, great hall with taxidermy fish and animals as well as an adventure playground wild deer and a huge lake. What's not to like for whagvis a lovely cheap day out"
The Willoughby family of Wollaton Hall - an amazing place :),"I have visited Wollaton Hall lots of times. I even wrote an essay on this when I was at University.  We love the history, the building, the parklands/deer. We love walking/cycling around the grounds and having picnics. Fantastic place."
Children enjoyed the animals,"Free to visit and my son loves the gorilla and giraffe, so we have made several trips.  Play area is enjoyable and parking plentiful."
Love wollaton Park ,This is our local large park and we visit regularly the playground is brilliant there is lots of space to walk around the lake is great and if your into geocashing there are plenty of spots around the massive parkAlso the cafe is great with some lovely food offerings
Nice evening ,Nice place for walking .really pleasant weather and well refreshing .if you guys wants a stress relief this is the best place for walking
Nice dog walking,"Great place for walking the dog although muddy in places at this time of year. There was a Christmas market going on which was nice and a cafe which looked good too! Shop on site too for gifts and souvenirs. We will go again because we want to see the house and obviously couldn’t do that with the dog,Nice play area for children near the car park.Lots going on here. Parking expensive according to locals but we walked so can’t confirm."
Days out,Great place in summer for a day out with a picnic. Love taking my dog for a walk around the park. Lovely to see the deer walking around.
Great place to visit,Great place to visit whichever the season! Free entrance and really interesting things inside the castle. Amazing garden and places for walk outside
Great ,"Went to the Christmas Fair, very nice place. The fair was very nice, lots of homemade items, well worth a visit if you in area. Hall is very nice and posh. Have a look around if you in area"
Great place to take the kids,We took our 2 grandchildren here aged 8 and 6. Was a great place to go to especially into the museum. There lots of open space so you can also take a picnic and sprawl out on the grass. We bought some animals from the museum shop. There's also a great play area for children. Worth going to. They both enjoyed it.
Lovely place ,"Had a lovely walk around the grounds, unfortunately we just missed the craft fair that was then clearing up, such a beautiful house and grounds even in the middle of winter. A great place fora lovely walk and some much needed fresh air."
Good day out,Nice park for walks with deer and stag roaming freely at close quarters! The hall has a museum with a large collection of wild life exhibits that are amazingly interesting for both children and adults
A really worthwhile tour,"Thankyou Sandra, for the extraordinary tour. My mother and I were in awe of your historical facts and your storytelling prowess. A fantastic tour well worth the money. To think we wouldn’t have seen or learnt any of the aspects covered if we hadn’t booked this tour! Wonderful and really well Done!"
A woodland Christmas adventure,Santa and the elves were lovely in a lovely Christmas setting. The children were given lots of attention and plenty of time with Santa who was attentive 🎅
good day,"had a good day, lots to do, relaxing, walking, had a cup of coffee with cake, also there is a museum"
Amazing,Amazing grounds had beautiful views loads to see museum was really greatFree roaming deer only saw 2 as was winter but be nice in summer
Beautiful Scenes,Visited Wollaston hall for a first date and was magical. Scenes and the deers and the walk is so nice. Need to count on beautiful weather though
Underground tour,"4 of us decided to do the underground tour at £6 a head and it was worth every penny.Our well informed guide took us beneath the hall to see the caves where beer and wines were kept, through dark tunnels up and down stairs all hewn from the limestone rock. As it was near Halloween there were several ghost stories too. We would recommend this to anyone wanting to find out more about this fantastic building."
"Great Walk, Cafe, and Museum ","We enjoyed the park, loved the deer and the lake  had coffee and cake, loved the museums and shops. Great morning out"
Tour lead by Sandra,I came to do the hidden tour on 12/11/19. Led by Sandra it was so informative and she made it interesting and made me feel very welcome. I have Aspergers and felt comfortable wandering around taking my photos. Learned so much and I’ve lived in Wollaton 33 years! It’s a side of Wollaton Hall definitely worth doing! Thankyou x
Beautiful,"Travelled from Leicester and wasn't disappointed. A most beautiful building housing a small museum.There was a small area for children with colouring tables. Toilets on site.Great little cafe.Lots of open walks with great paths.  Plenty of seats to just sit and admire the beautiful scenery. A lake with geeses, ducks and swans. Fantastic photography site.Plenty of room for cycles,  walkers and dogs.Exceptionally clean. Small outdoor market was on when we were there with freshly made pizzas in the courtyard and a mobile tea/coffee/hot chocolate vintage style van (bit of a wait but was worth it!). This is definitely one of our new favourite places. Note: car parking £3 for 3 hours and £5 for day BUT you can only pay cash ir card with the Ringo parking app, bit of a faff downloading that as unfortunately didn't have change on us but we got there in the end. If you want a guided tour with the historical info that's payable and I believe it's £10 per adult but we were happy just wandering around as went as short notice. Took a picnic and sat at the top of the hill watching the sun set. Highly recommend!"
Excellent ,"What a place Plenty too do and seeExcellently presented and great value. Lovely park , restaurants, children’s play areas and grounds. The house is amazing and educational for all the family."
A jewel in the East Midlands,"I visited the park on 4 occasions during October. Three times were for a beautiful autumn walk with the leaves changing colour each time and I was fortunate to pick dry sunny days. The lake is well worth walk around as well as all other areas of the park. On my last visit to Wolllaton I went into the house, something I haven't been in the house for a couple of years. It was fabulous. I also went to the section that has fossils and gemstones with my 8 year old lad who is interested in that kind of thing. He loved the experience of seeing and touching gems and fossils he had only ever seen in a book before."
Ghost Tour,"Visited Wollaton Hall for an organized Ghost tour. About 2 hours long & a drink included half way through. Our guide was very knowledgeable & took us to different rooms & told us of the stories relevant to the rooms. Visited the kitchen& sellers, even took a trip to the roof. The view was stunning, would definitely recommend this tour."
"Excellent Free Park, Gardens and Museum","We had a couple of hours to kill before leaving the city so decided to call in here and I have to say what a find. There are over 500 acres of parkland/ deer park with lake and formal gardens. At the centre piece is the magnificent hall which is now a Natural History Museum. There is also a large stabke block that holds a gift shop, two tea rooms, an industrial museum (only open weekends and bank hols) and a potting shed.And the best thing is that all this is free apart from the car park charge (£3 - £5)."
Absolutely Stunning Hall and Gardens with Deer,"This place is one of my favourite places to spend time. The grounds are superbly kept and stunning, The house is a natural history museum and the architecture is awesome. There are a couple of gift shops, a courtyard with toilets, a table tennis table and a small industrial museum. They have heaps of events all year round. So many beautiful spaces to sit and have a picnic in the summer. Red deer wandering feely that you can get fairly close to and they are spectacular. The cafe does some great cakes and hot food. Ice cfeam vans in the summer, they have outdoor cinema in the summer and theatre too. You feel like you are miles from the city yet it is just down the road from the QMC hospital so is really central. 10 mins on the bus to Nottingham. Buses from Derby road right outside the gates. Love this place and can't recommend it enough!"
Flying visit,Hadn't been here for a very long time (over 45 years!) as I was a child when I last visited. All still free other than the parking which is reasonable enough (£3 for up to 3 hours or £5 all day). Lots of people enjoying a bright half term day. Grounds are lovely and far reaching. The building itself is very impressive but unfortunately the interior has been stripped bare over the years but it now serves as a mini museum with a nod towards the family history of the halk. Incredible that it is main by Nottinghamshire City Council rather than the National Trust. Enjoyable way of spending a couple.of hours.
Red Deer Rut,Had a lovely walk at the weekend to see the Red Deer rut and wasn't disappointed spent over a hour just watching these 2 .Had a stroll around the lake as well and was happy to see the ringed necked parakeets.  On the down side the car park is over priced and full of great pot holes .
A must place to go if you are a visiting Nottingham,"The amazing wollaton hall, gardens and lake the roaming deer... and of course the caves .... and wayne manor as used in the Batman movie the dark night rises"
"Amazing, beautiful place to visit.","Love it here, very nice place to go with the family. Recommend coming here with the family in the summer."
STUNNING Place !,"I came up from Essex to see the Red Stags as it is the rutting season . This is my second visit here , I came alone so I can just wonder and take my time getting the Photos , plus getting close to nature !The park is just amazing , Wollaton Hall is just Stunning to look at .I spoke to a few people and they said there had not been much rutting , maybe a little early . If your into wildlife this is a must place to go . All sorts of bird life . Loads of Squirrels a couple seem a little tame , all running around collecting nuts etc before winter sets in . The main reason I went was for the Deer ... WOW .. they are truly Magnificent !!  People sadly get far too close to them makes me angry ! Really there is no need , there was so many benches around the place to sit back and take in their beauty !  The deer there are Red Stags /Hinds ... plus Fallow Deer !"
"Great place, love it!","I have been bringing the kids here for years, such a great space for walks, picnics and a day out. Plenty to see and do, I'd recommend for anyone to come and see."
Lovely place to visit,There is a reason this place is Bruce Wayne's mansion in one of the Batman movies.  The structure is just majestic.  We're able to see deer upclose on several instances we've been to this place.It is also accessible via public transport.  Bus stops stop right in front of their gates which makes it an easy commute.
Brilliant break from lectures,"This is a wonderful estate with natural history museum incorporated into the main house. The museum features stuffed animals as the main feature. The estate boasts fantabulous walks, with visitors encouraged to bring picnics for the summer months. Deer do roam the estate, so cattle grids at driveways and heavy gates at pedestrian entrances feature. If it is rutting season, visitors are warned against walking in the park, as the male deer will be very territorial at this time."
Magnificent Estate,We went to the Wollaton Hall to experience the remarkable architecture of the buildings and the immaculate grounds. There were deer in every field of the estate
A gem on the outskirts of Nottingham.,"Ok I live in Nottingham........but that is no reason why I can't applaud something that is only 4 miles out of the city centre and I grew up with.Wollaton Hall was built in 1588 (the same year as the Spanish Armada).It's owned and run by Nottingham City Council.I grew up playing in it grounds and around the lake area and have loved it all my life.As a child, the hall had a fantastic natural history collection and loads of history.You only pay for carparking, the extensive grounds, the lake area, the gardens, the hall with its natural history collections and the history of some who lived there.....and don't forget to go and see the camelia house, a true feat of Victorian engineering and architecture.The stable block houses a cafe, exibition and the Industrial Museum (small extra charge) which houses the great Basford Beam Engine (Victorian engineering at its best) and many other steam driven items (Steaming days are the last Sunday in the month.)The museum also houses many other items large and small, all links to Nottingham's industrial heritage.If the weathers good it's a great day out........if it's wet. well there is still plenty to see.Grab your waterproofs and wellies and enjoy the wildlife.Me........ I go there at least once a month and still get a buzz from the hall and walking around the lake area.Whether you're a local or a tourist.........there's plenty to see and do.Enjoy it."
Day trip,Didn't know what to expect as hadn't been before and we had a tour with a very knowledgeable lady called Sandra really enjoyed her company at a cost of £10 for the tour but actually was  around 2hours as she had so much information to give.brilliant day plus see a beautiful stag and huge gardens & walks
Nice visit if the weather is good,"Expansive grounds which are well kept and easy parking. Hall was undergoing repairs. Some parts easy to visit, others not. Some wildlife and good manicured gardens. Worth a visit if the sun is out!"
Day out,Very enjoyable lovely  place...... very peaceful house very interesting  will certainly  go again......why should you need more  than 100 ......its really silly
Mr,Very good fun. Did you know batman was filmed here!The animaps are also great fun to watch prollock around
Great place for afternoon walks!,"One of my absolute places for walks, this very large parkland has lots of paths with roaming deer. Easy and relaxing way to enjoy your afternoon."
Relaxing place to visit ,Wollaton Hall (famous for being in some of the Dark Knight movies) is a relaxing place to visit in Nottingham and great for kids to play or roam in the grounds. The hall has a fascinating collection of taxidermy and some nice shops and cafés which remain open after the hall itself closes.
A nice place for an afternoon walk,The deer park makes this a bit different from your standard English park. Wollaton Hall is a fine building and there is a place nearby to grab a snack and a drink once you've had a nice walk round. Great too for a kick-about with the kids as space is in plentiful supply.
great free place to visit,Found this place through the Tourist Office info. Great place. Huge parkland with roaming deer. Big car park (pay and display). Lots of green space. Manor house was interesting. Natural History museum of various 'stuffed' or preserved animals was interesting and fascinating. Great displays within the manor house itself. Nice formal gardens. Shame the Glasshouse was closed. Coffee shop in courtyard was good. And the little pay to enter museum looked interesting too. A worthwhile find and worth a visit.
The Greatest Showman Outdoor Cinema,"My Friends and I visited here to watch the Greatest Show Man, it was very well organised, I was slightly shocked at how late the film started/finished (lots of children present on a school night), I wasn't aware it was such a late start time, we waited until sundown, at around 11 the rain started so we missed the end because we were soaking wet. The staff organised the event well. Thank you for a great evening🎩🐘🐎."
Park with a house,If you want to see where Batman lives you will like this but also be disappointed. The bat cave isn’t here nor is Alfred. The park grounds are vast with deer roaming free. There is a great kids play area and of course the Manor which is fascinating.
Well worth a visit,"Took the grandchildren, they enjoyed the play park, running in acres of well maintained space and the hall and natural history museum, which is still free. Only necessary to pay for parking, which was reasonable. Must be good the grandchildren have requested a return visit."
Pretty.,"Very impressive looking hall. Lots of parking, deer running wild in the grounds.The hall itself contains a museum which is good to wander around. Nice walks in the grounds around a lake."
beautiful gardens,Fantastic green spaces. Lovely to be able to get so close to the deer. I have to say it was a beautifully sunny day but if you like a walk this place is the bees knees. The hall is a little faded now. The stuffed animals won't be to everyone's taste but it is a chance to get a close look at some exotic creatures.
Afternoon visit ,Came here with son to spend few hours from hospital .Nice grounds and building to exploreAs building is free to enter it was worth the trip
Good for families or a casual walk in any seasons,"One of the best park in the UK.I usually come every month, walk around in the park for an hour or so."
A great place to relax!,"My wife and I took our two dogs out for sunny afternoon walk last Sunday and thoroughly enjoyed it.It is a great place to bring family, children and dogs alike with plenty of open space, parks for the kids and to look a the deer running wild in the fields.We ended to visit with a lovely ice cream from the van looking up at the picturesque hall on top of the hill. This is only a few minutes from where we live and within walking/easy cycling so will be visiting more over the coming weeks and months"
Walking against dementia ,"We visited a couple of times even yesterday we did the walking against dementia for Alzheimer’s society and was an amazing experience. It is a beautiful peaceful and lovely experience, we love to come back all the time."
Beautiful ,"Have been coming here since I was a child and will continue to do so with my own child. It's a lovely place with plenty of parking and good facilities. The roaming deer are a huge attraction. Plenty of green spaces surrounding the Hall and gardens which are also worth a walk round. You could easily come and spend a day here with family, bring a picnic in the sunshine and enjoy being surrounded by nature and greenery. Well worth a trip and great value for money considering the small amount you pay to park as long as you make a day of it."
All the fun,When you wantA park day outGo to wollastonSing and shoutWhile you're thereHave an ice cream Hot chocolate And smile with a beam
Good,Great fun for the kids. Loads of space for dogs and kids to tun wild. Good park and lake. Cafe very expensive so take your own food and drink
Busy B/H weekend but ample space for parking.,"Lovely place with a large Park, lake & Deer. Visited the industrial museum and enjoyed chatting with some very informative volunteers. Unfortunately missed visiting the hall due to a wedding occasion. Hopefully we can visit again sometime."
Great day out on bank holiday weekend....,"Travelled here fo bank holiday weekend in August 2019. It was a great day out and wasn't too busy. Although the weather was hot, over 28C we managed a good walk around the grounds. Inside the house the temperatures got a lot warmer, probably over 32C but if you used some the chairs for a rest pit was OK. Some kids had a few melt downs probably due to the weather I guess but their Mums and Dads did their best with them. Didn't see any of the deer on this trip. Parking wasn't too bad and found a place under some shade so the car wasn't too warm when we returned to it."
Fascinating,We did the private tour of the unseen areas with our guide. This tour was really informative and educational. Well worth the money.
Fantastic place!,"So much to see and do here. Great grounds with so much wildlife and nature to spot. We actually watched the deer leaving their shaded spot on the island then wading through the lake.  Magical! It was like being part of a David Attenborough nature programme! We travel from Derby on the Y5 bus that stops outside the Beeston Lodge entrance on Derby road then walk through and you're in the grounds, easy!"
Wollaston Hall,"Wollaron Hall and deer Park is an impressive venue in itself. It is free to wander around the Hall, grounds, lake and deer Park. It also holds some impressive events well worth a visit. I have been there twice this month. First for the excellent food and drink festival, the biggest in the country and then for the outdoor cinema screening of Bohemian Rhapsody."
"Under the stars, Here We Go Again","Barmy summer night watching a feel good film, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, with  Wollaton Hall as a backdrop it was fabulous, then as you go back to the car take time to view the front of this stunning building."
FREE - and Fabulous.,You do have to pay for car parking but the Hall and the gardens are free to enter and are significantly impressive set as they are in deer infested woodland. Add to this the cinematic starring role for the venue in Batman and you have a sure fire day out for all the family - picnic areas abound and play areas are plentiful !! In school holidays they normally dedicate a large area to keep children occupied.A well thought and markedly different design to almost any house I've ever seen from a similar period ...... but then again that could just be my sheltered existence.
Outdoor cinema,Fab night at the outdoor cinema with friends watching A Star Is Born. We took a picnic and some prosecco and a blanket and had a grand night. Could be better lit though in the car park but then I think that about all of Wollaton Park.
Unexpected in the most beautiful way.,"My Partner and I come here whenever we get a chance...It's beautiful and quiet, you can loose yourself in the tranquil gardens teeming with wildlife.Parking is easy and adequate, there are a couple of shops and a cafe which sells beautiful food.Wollaton Hall is incredible, and a must see for all the family."
The history tour is great value for money.,"As well as the fantastic grounds and other free activities, the £10pp history tour that lasts about an hour is great value for money. And if you have an interest about the filming of batman they will explain that to you too. Sandra was lovely!! Good banter and doesnt bore you, keeps the tour alive!! I would recommend if you get the chance to visit old Wayne manor!! There are about 100 steps in total that you will go up and down so I would say youd need to be pretty mobile and not mind a sweaty top lip when you get to the top room 😂"
Fantastic ,A great place to go to lose several hours. A beautiful setting. Deer roaming free. Brilliant for children. Thanks again
I'm Batman,"For anyone that doesn't know the outside of Wollaton Hall was Wayne Manor in Batman Begins. I watched the film again recently and there are no mistaking this building on the screen. Situated high on the hill it over looks the deer park, gardens and lake. A great place to spot wildlife or to simply have a stroll around the grounds. The hall itself these days is more of a museum of natural history with a large collection of exhibits on three floors.  This was very interesting and very entertaining for the kids. A great afternoon out."
Good venue for civil wedding ,Our friends had their civil ceremony there. Staff are efficient and organized. We had drinks and canapés in the garden afterwards. Lovely setting. Recommened.
Beautiful place to go,"We've spent there a few hours walking around the park and a lake, we were positively surprised that the entrance to the Hall was for free. I was very impressed with the beauty of both the Hall and the park, definitely worth visiting."
Great place to visit throughout year,"Lovely park to walk round, a good hour walk if you stick to the edges. Or perfect for a picnic and deer spotting. Large children's playground and additional cafe by lower car park. Car parking is 3-5 pounds, just annoying you have to pay with coins - can't everywhere just be card now!!"
Enjoyable every time!,We regularly visit here. My children love the museum and the park and the grounds is always brill to get them plenty of exercise whilst running around. It is definitely a fab place to go for the day.
Mrs wightman,"Lovley day out I would strongly recommend it Lots to see and do for all the family. The children really enjoyed looking at the Animals in the hall , and running of some energy on the park  , nanna enjoyed the grounds and a lovley coffee in the cafe ,"
Beautiful family friendly cheap day out!,"The only thing I paid for was parking, this place is great for a family picnic day out. There is a free museum and an awesome park. There is a beautiful lake around the back for a nice stroll.There are events like outdoor cinema and bat walks you can book.This will be a place I visit regularly as my friends and family enjoy coming here."
A great day out,The various exhibitions on here are always very good and the permanent collections take you back in history
Perfect day out for the whole family!,"Welcome to Wayne Manor! Or as they like to call it in Nottingham, Wollaton Hall. This 400 year old home’s exterior was used in the film Batman: The Dark Night Rises..Built in 1580 by Sir Francis Willoughby, (at a cost that nearly bankrupted his family!) it is now used as the area’s natural history museum. The grounds and the home are free to tour (although a donation is greatly appreciated), you can also take a behind the scenes tour for £10 per person. We opted for the tour, and it was well worth the price! Our guide Sandra took us to the very topmost room and onto the rooftop for some scandalous stories and interesting history. Additionally, we toured beneath the home, into the kitchens and water caves dug into the hill. You don’t get access to these areas without the tour. The remaining areas of the home are filled with creatures great and small from around the globe. A fascinating dive into the natural world! .Afterward, we visited the café and shops, and wondered around the gardens and grounds (not all 800 acres though!) On our way out, we spotted their famous Red Deer herds and stopped to enjoy their company. My daughter enjoyed the playground and especially the zip line!"
Beautiful park for recreation,We love to walk around the park and stop for coffee at the cafeteria. Also love the special days like the war weekend and the motor show.
Visited to see the dinosaur ,"We came to see the dinosaur show, was pretty good the place was lovely and manicured to say we attended in Feb it was cold however the displays where really good. Would come back."
Great fun Day out,Beautiful grounds and garden's and the café is really good too. Lots of stuff to see and do especially the park for kids
"Lovely Day out, calm in the city!","We happened to turn up on 'super-hero' day which wasn't for us but looked great fun for all the dressed-up children! We loved the house and both the Natural History and Industrial Museums. We also had a wander around the grounds and it was so peaceful, amazing as it felt we could have been miles from the city. We came across a stag calmly grazing by the lake paying no attention to everybody there. We didn't approach him, neither did anybody else, it was amazing to watch such a majestic creature go about his business. Great cheap day out. I'd highly recommend it to everyone."
Nice day out,Great park and hall. Brilliant gem in Nottingham. Loved it. Amazing architecture and friendly staff.
A great find ,We were staying in Nottingham for my daughters cheerleading competition and  we didn’t want to head straight home the following day so we decided a visit here would be good . We arrived just as a sponsored walk of the grounds  for testicular cancer was about to begin so the car park was busy but we still managed to park . We decided to visit the Hall first to give the walkers time to set off . The hall was interesting the walk round the gardens beautiful and I never thought I would get so close to the deers but they weren’t a big put off by human visitors .
Stunning,"Absolutely gorgeous building and grounds. Access to site is free  just a £3 charge for car parking. Lots for the kids to do and see, large natural history museum within the house. Deer park was amazing. Highly recommend. Plus it was Wayne Manor in Dark Knight 🤗"
Amazing Day Out,"Fabulous park, we stayed in Nottingham and only a short bus ride from the hotel was this Gem. Beautiful walks, free entry to the house and amazing orange & pomegranate cake in the cafe , a must if your in the area"
Parking ,Parking. That is all. Rip off. Year on year rises yet park is less looked after. Needs some investment to keep up
Wonderful local attraction,Wollaton Park is a lovely loal attraction with plenty of free space to walk around. The cafes are a welcome treat and the open air cinema we attended recently was a uge hit with everyone
Amazing,"When I read the reviews before going there, I couldn't believe that I would have a chance to see deers.But it was amazing atmosphere We saw a lot."
Nice place for graduation photo,"Drive there from city around 15 mins, need to pay for the car park. No restaurant or coffee shop found. Great place for photo, can’t see the deers this time, which suppose have. The water in the lake a bit dirty."
fun day out,"came on the hottest day of the year so far, we indulged ourselves with lots of ice cream and enjoyed the weather and views. i come here often with my partner and its probably the best park in nottingham for fun days out."
Wonderful Trip Out despite the terrible weather,A day trip to Wollaton Hall and Park. A lovely setting magnificent Hall and grounds. There are many many stuffed animals of all sorts. The architecture is stunning and quite intricate. I enjoyed the engineering museum so much history to see and I didn't realise just how much of our engineering derived from Nottingham. Nice food in the cafes when you want to take a break.
Uncle Ray s Steam Engine ,I have taken the time of talking to you about uncle Ray s engine he himself built and its in Woolaton steam museum I'm quite disappointed that I can't see it as you r museum s open Sunday I think it ought to be open on Saturdays and Fridays instead how can anyone who carn t drive get to see the museum Richard walker
Beautiful building and an excellent park.,I met up with lots of family members here and it was a brilliant venue. The hall is free to enter and has a wealth of stuffed animals of all kinds. The architecture is intricate and lovely. There was no sign of any deer in the park.The cafe was a bit overpriced for some fairly obscure modern style food. The waitresses are a little haphazard when serving. My vegetarian cousin was served something with chicken. Oops.
Suprised !!,"This was my first outing to the park and I was extremely impressed with way the house and gardens are set out, lovely to walk  around and not underneath other peoples feet. The wildlife was natural and how it should be. Although they allow dogs on leads I would still make sure you have your dog under control. Will defiantly be visiting again!!"
Great Hall & Deer Park,"From a tourism perspective, the strengths of Wollaton Hall and park are the hall itself, architecturally, including the interiors, the great expanse of the surrounding park, and the presence of both Red and Fallow Deer herds. Note that the hall has virtually no period furnishings. Most of the interior is a regional natural history museum (e.g. taxidermy displays), only a few of which are all that interesting. There are also exhibits that focus on the house (e.g. stairway murals, ceiling, etc), and one exhibit are that provides some history of the family that owned the hall."
"Lovely venue, well kept and interest museum ","The best bit... only £3 to park and exploreWe were greeted by a lovely gathering of deer, with stunning antlers and very tolerant of the visitorsThe hall itself it a pleasant building to look at from a distance and the grounds are well kept and make for a lovely walk. The gardens at the back of the hall were nice to relax inThe museum, whilst some sections are quite old contained a lot of interesting information about nature and wildlife in the UK. We found this really good and spent a couple of hours exploringIf you are in the area well worth a visit"
Lovely park in Nottingham,"With a big playground for children and a huge park for a picnic or a walk, the open air opportunities in the city park are good, in addition to the natural history museum in the Hall.  Gardens also provide a pleasant walk. Gift shops and tearooms are reasonable."
Great place to visit,Fascinating place to go especially the natural history parts. I remembered it from when I was a teenager and it brought back many great memories.
Definetly Worth a Visit,"My wife and I visited Wollaton Hall this weekend and really enjoyed walking around the hall. Whilst there is no entry free to the hall itself, I would highly recommend going for the 'behind the scenes' tour for £10, worth every penny.Ben our guide knew all the history of the castle. There were so many hidden passages! We went to the roof top and right down to the cold wine and beer cellars. plus all the other many rooms in between. The tour last around 1 hour stopping and talking about aspect of history about the hall and Sir Francis Willoughby. We both learnt a lot. If you like history, you will not be disappointed.A special thanks to Ben our tour guide.Shay and Anita"
Lovely gardens,"The park is a lovely place to go for a walk and get back to nature, the gardens are very well kept and the hall is a thing of beauty and you can buy little things from years pass even little plants."
Nice place,Lovely place for day out. It's mostly free apart from additional museum which costs £3 per person to enter. Also the deer are friendly and will walk close by people.
Fantastic House,"a great old house with an interesting natural history museum. A fun and educational trip for the family.Extensive gardens, a children's play park and cafe near the entrance to the grounds but a bit of a walk to the house itself. Would recommend visiting as an enjoyable day out."
Lovely visit,Beautiful attractive place. Been here.many times for picnics and stuff. Excited for splendour festival
Sunday visit to look at classic cars,"Ws visited autokarna at Wollaton area and it was lovely!,great scenery for old classics cars all well new ones.Well fone for coffee shop near kids area and more picnic space.love there so at early morning when is quiet or late evening when not busy.love always"
Family day out,Lovely place to visit....educational but very relaxed and the Batman connection was a real bonus. 10/10
a nice stroll,"We live 15 minutes drive from here yet we dont visit that often the last time being May 2013. Called here this morning Thursday 4th july 2019, got 3 hours free parking with my Blue Badge which is good. Had a gentle stroll around the lake which is so peaceful. lots of school children about today. Was a struggle back up the hill where we stopped and had a coffee and toast. Nice shop and gardening shop plus a small exhibition in the shop on local wildlife. The adventure playground looks good and will be bringing the grandkids in the school holidays. Will visit again soon and go in the hall and gardens"
Super,"Fabulous place to stroll around on a warm summer evening but, careful with young breeding herds of Deer."
Beautiful day out,"I was meeting an old school friend and this was half way from our respective homes. Neither of us had heard of this place but were both very pleasantly surprised. There are plenty of car parking places and the deer are just wandering around the grounds, lovely to look at. The Hall is amazing and even though I am not and great lover of stuffed animals found the natural museum to be extremely interesting and informative. There is a small charge in the car park but entrance to the museum is free, another bonus. there are a couple of cafes and shops as well. Well worth a day out. Dogs are allowed but must be on a lead because of the deer."
Day out.,A interesting hall to visit...the lake and deer park a must..took a picnic ....Ice cream from cafe all in all cheap day out ..
Little known gem,"First off, it's just far enough from the city centre to make it easy to find !Lots of car parking at a good price.Loads of parkland and gardens to wander round, could take a day !The hall itself is fantastic, free admission and has enough exhibits inside to keep you interested for a few hours.A few shops around the hall to get plants, gifts, food stuffs etc.Quite honestly, don't miss it if you're either in the area looking for somewhere or planning a visit !"
Beautiful,"Wolla ton hall is a beautiful place to look around. Kids loved exploring in there and had a fantastic. Outdoors is a beautiful walk. Golf course, children's play area, beautiful lake and lovely surroundings. If you don't mind dodging deer poo then a great place for a picnic. It's nice to see the deer roaming free. Very family friendly and a wonderful place to have an outing"
Walk in the woods,"A good Sunday morning walk around the grounds and lake with plenty to do, hall, industrial museum all to visit"
"Dramatic building, fantastic day","What a place!  What a find!  Great for singles, couples and families alike.  Have a lovely walk and then take in the exhibition in the hall."
Always a great place to visit ,"This is the hall they used in one of the Batman movies. It’s a beautiful looking building with a museum that is free, just pay for the car parking .The grounds are beautiful and you could walk for miles."
Gorgeous but disappointinng,"Drove for 20 minutes to go to this gorgeous hall. Outside and inside were both beautiful, but the fact that the only things inside were taxidermic animals was really quite sad. There also wasn’t a giant dinosaur as advertised, but the deer were cute."
Lovely Tudor House,"I came to this house and the park around it on a perfect sunny day, so it was an idyllic visit. Parkland rolls in all directions, and I saw a herd of deer close by, sheltering under a tree. This park is a public amenity that is free, so you don't get the lavish gardens of places like Hampton Court, but it has a special atmosphere of its own. The house is a remarkable piece of architecture that is perhaps underrated. It looks a dream from both front and back. The rear faces a lovely, quiet square of grass and statues, with benches to sit on in peace and content. I did go inside the Hall, but it houses an old collection of stuffed birds and animals--not my sort of thing. But as a building, Wollaton Hall is an overlooked gem."
Wallaton Hall / Natural History Museum,"It’s Elizabethan. It’s built in the 1580s. It’s on a hill in the middle of a park, and if you’re one of those city-people like me, look out for brown hairy stuff at a distance – they’ve got deer! The Wollaton Hall once belonged to the Willoughby family, who over the generations had this curious interest in collecting specimens. As soon as you realize this, it would become clear as to why this Grade I-listed building is now also the flagship Natural History Museum of the area that is Nottingham. And hopefully feeling less violated when you’re greeted by this hippopotamus at the entrance door (this being a convention of “zoological” museums; check out, for example, Cambridge’s Museum of Zoology and Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences). You’ll soon realize yourself torn between two tourist foci, one having the hall as a hall, the other being the collection of wondrous creatures. Some funny curational incoherence can be found much like the Sedgwick Museum or Southeast London’s Horniman Museum, for in some inconspicuous corners there would be these old-school displays – yes literally, butterflies arranged by paper pins to be unriddled by yellowing, typewritten cardboards. But then there’s effectively a third, in case you’re more interested in the living than the dead – there are these insect tanks on the upper floor. And you’re really more interested in the family and the heritage, do start with the Cassandra Room on ground floor. There, beautiful paper-sculptures tell the history of the family.Now get down the hill to find your favourite deer."
Lovely,We visited Wollaton Hall during a vintage car rally. The house is lovely with lots of natural history exhibits. The industrial museum is fascinating and a definite must-do for any visitors.
Good day out,"This is an excellent council owned facility comprising extensive grounds, an industrial Museum and a natural history museum within the impressive mansion house. There is also a large play area for children."
Great family day out for free!! ,This was our first visit and we loved it! Armed with a picnic lunch we headed straight to the children’s play area. Lots of equipment to play on and well kept. There is a free museum (in the big house) you can walk around although this is only filled with dead stuffed animals which my children found to be a bit distressing so we skipped through pretty quick and it is a steep walk up a hill or lots of steps! Didn’t notice any way of getting to it if you struggle with mobility/wheelchair access. The other museum (in the courtyard) you have to pay for. We spotted 2 ice cream vans in the grounds. Toilet facilities are clean and well kept/easy to access. The deer were lovely but make sure you take some extra shoes as to get to them you need to walk a big field that is absolutely full of deer poop. Lovely views. All in all we really enjoyed the day! Most importantly the kids LOVED it. Will definitely return
Favourite place in the world bar none.,"I've travelled all around the country and the world for the past 40 years and this is where I want my ashes sprinkled. The magic and beauty of this park is clear for all to see. The gorilla in the museum is absolutely the best thing ever for young kids although it may be a little intimidating after a chuckle at its willy most kids love it! Hahaha Beautiful rose gardens, fantastic walking area and amazing lake. The whole place is just the most beautiful park in the world to me and it is quite obvious why Hollywood chose it as Wayne Manor for their location in the Batman film."
Walking the dog!,"Well it never gets boring walking around Wollaton with the dog!She loves every part of it , especially the ducks !"
Amazing,Always have an amazing visit here. I am desperate to see the parts that are only on tours. I need to get booked on. I want to see the ballroom on top floor and the baths underground. Love this place!
wollaton hall,"last time i went the hall seemed a bit empty to what it use to be like when i was younger,the pond round the side of the hall was empty.My grandaughter loved feeding the squirrels and there is a cafe, bit expensive though, there is a park for the children, the grounds are lovely, and the deer that wonder round the grounds are lovely,just have to be careful when it is rutting season."
Nice park for a stroll,Lovely park to walk through on a sunny day from the university side to the Admiral Rodney pub - plenty of deers to see too.
Could do with some modernisation!,"The hall and grounds are stunning. The car park is chargeable but entry into the hall is free. There is also a chargeable industrial museum, cafe, shop etcThe exhibits are interesting up to a point but a bit dated as some of them have been there since the 1920s! Would be worth adding a bit of modern technology or more interactivity. Probably still good for very young children but a bit dusty and motheaten to entertain older ones for long.I rather like the nostalgia but if you’re not into stuffed animals and birds there is little to entertain inside the hall. Stick to the grounds with the fabulous views, deer, places to walk and play."
A beautiful place,"My daughter is seven and we have frequented the Park ever since she was born. She loves the Deer, the Museum and the obligatory walk around the lake."
Lovely grounds. ,"The grounds are lovely to walk around, we spent a few hours strolling, it's wonderful to be able to walk amongst the Deers, they are stunningly beautiful. The lake is stunning too, it wasn't a particularly warm day, otherwise I would've loved to sit and have a picnic here, I will be returning, there's a small fee for the carpark."
Great place for a little walk and a coffee,"I often visit Wollaton Park for a walk and a coffee with friends, It if free to enter, just pay for parking. There is also a children’s playground."
Great grounds,"The place is lovely to walk around and has deer in the fields which is fantastic. Also helps that the hall was used as Bruce Wayne's manor in batman begins, which appealed to my geeky side too!"
Disappointing,"I had only briefly looked at what to expect at Wollaton Hall and my expectations were high as we pulled into the pay and display car park.  At the top of a gentle slope was a magnificent looking building.  A gentle stroll in the sunshine up to the front door and it went downhill from there.  The rooms that are open to the public are full of stuffed dead animals, and, because entry is free and it as half term, there were many children been allowed to do what they want, running round under no control. The stuffed dead animals are a collection from a previous owner, though they would have been better put in the attic and forgotten about.  The council, who own the place, have done little to give details of what the rooms were used for, or the history of the place, or indeed opening up the many rooms you couldn’t get into."
Wollaton Hall and Park,"This was the most interesting and unexpected pleasure! A MUST visit for so many reasons. First of all, it’s FREE and there are so many beautiful and interesting things to look at, the architecture, the grounds, the amazing exhibits, the history, and the amazing cut paper exhibits.  We spent over 2 hours exploring and I wanted at least 2 more! I was sad we had not arrived earlier!  It is free, but you feel compelled to donate to maintain this amazing site. One of the highlights of our 21 days in England ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Walk in the park,"Great place to walk around, beautiful lake and nice ice-cream available in the park. Worth visiting for a nice day out"
Great day out,Visit here regularly with my girls. It's a great day out. Loads to do. The deers. The flower garden. The park. The animals in the halls. Only issue is it's awkward to get to on the buses. But defo a thumbs up from me
A walk in the park!,"We walked from Highfields Park through the University area and on to Wollaton Park. It's always a good place to wander, this time we went around the lake and called on the courtyard for a tea break. Didn't do the house this time but there's lots to see there too."
amazing wedding,"yesterday attended the most lovely wedding in the most wonderful location at Wollaton hall,the place it self is amazing,the staff could not be more helpful and friendly,the caterer and his team did an amazing carvery and worked so hard,its truly was a magical day."
Excellent free park and natural history museum near heart of Nottingham,"A lovely free day out. One just has to pay for car parking. Free on foot. Apart from the main drive, there are several foot entrances. The grounds of the grade 1 Elizabethan city house are quite extensive, with lake, formal gardens, orangery, and very good children's play park. Red and Fallow deer roam the park. Wollaton Hall  houses a fascinating natural history museum, with free admission. The collections largely date from a much earlier century when it was deemed acceptable and educational to own exhibits, seen only in photographs. Signage to the collection rooms would be useful,  One arrives into an almost empty hall, and it's easy to miss out areas. Stairs lead to an upper floor, and there is also a lift; both unsigned when last visited. A little further down the hill is an excellent Industrial Museum with a small admission price. There are eating facilities, although we didn't eat.The park hosts an array of events throughout the year, and there are guided tours of the hall itself. Check opening hours of hall, as differ from park. Something for everyone!"
Great new cafe and play area,"This is a lovely place to visit with small children, adults only and for a solo walk. The new cafe is a great addition and the play area is great for children."
Excellent day out,"Beautiful out house and grounds well worth a visit. Ample cheap parking in deer park. Large children's play park, two cafeterias and an ice cream shop. The house has a Natural history museum in it, which is free to enter. Sad to see some of the exhibits but equally interesting. Pleased they no longer accept exhibits which have been killed by hunters. Grounds and gardens extensive and have several lovely walks. Great views across parkland and lake, plus free roaming deer."
a nice day out !!,a very nice place for all the family - with play area / cafes / walks / gardens / museum . loads of space for all the family
Good enough for Batman.  ,"Let's start with the good points about Wollaton Hall. Well, it's a beautiful hall surrounded by masses of land that contain a very sufficient play area with it's own cafe. Also a great courtyard  containing a deli, cafe and an industrial museum. The gardens themselves are great. The house itself contains so much history as it houses Nottingham's Natural History Museum and is very informative. The building itself is a piece of art.So why not 5 stars? Well, a couple of places in the house could do with a bit of a revamp and they don't advertise the fact that this place was Wayne Manor in the film The Dark Knight Rises. I'd be telling everyone that. We will be returning."
Lovely,We have been here a lot the house is wonderful.the lake is beautiful you have to have a walk around it to see the beauty of it .
Unexpected delight,"First time at Wollaton Hall, brought about because my son’s fine art teacher recommended it as a place he can study form. Spectacular building and contents, amazing grounds, with plenty of facilities, cafes, play areas and loads of space for picnics. The dog loved it too, and the disabled parking is in just the right place. Just delightful"
Awesome park and Batman's mansion!,"I love this place!The park is so nice, with big well maintened lawns, a bit of wood, grasslands, a nice lake with ducks and geese, and a beautifully maintened enclosed garden with flowers and very old trees. It is enclosed to protect it from the many deers that roam freely in the park, you don't always see them but it's so nice to have such an encounter! I always take people visiting me here without telling them about the deers, and it's so magical to see their amazement when they happen to be 2m away from a majestic stag!In the middle of this big park you have hall that serve as a natural history museum with a lot of stuffed animals, local species and more exotic ones, and a space for dinosaurs. Great for kids and free! If you visit Nottingham as a family, definitly plan to spend at least half a day there"
Great way to spend a morning or afternoon.,"Well worth a visit especially with kids. They can see the animals in Wollaston Hall. Can run around the parks, feed ducks and geese. refreshments available."
Relaxing walks,The views and atmosphere are just amazing for a relaxing walk/jog after a long day of work. The deers are quite peaceful.
Gorgeous,The park itself is gorgeous lovely to go for a stroll or picnic on a beautiful day. The hall itself is very quirky being a museum for stuffed animals so if that’s what you like then it’s great.
Always a nice walk,Always a nice walk around the grounds but a problem I noticed this time was there was no cash machine.
Brilliant ,"Fantastic for a walk with the children and dogs, and love that the deer live so happily here. Gorgeous little coffee truck down near the lake; perfectly situated!  Two very happy little dogs after a trip here!"
Terrible signage and poor staff,"Planned this day out for a while to enjoy the hall and funfair. The whole visit was a huge disappointment. First of all the signage to disabled parking was non-existent until following the roads further towards the hall. Parked and walked through the courtyard to find a signpost for the hall. Following this signage led to steps, nowhere was signposted with ramp access. Eventually got to the front of the house and yet more steps with no clear signage for disabled access. Once in the hall it was unclear which way to go and downstairs was taxidermy heaven. Some attempts to make it a child-friendly museum had been made but blunt pencil crayons and a fishing game minus the magnet were examples of how tired and worn it was. Finally worked out how to get upstairs in a lift but, on the door opening, there was an unattended bag to the rear. We reported the bag to a member of staff who was unbelievably complacent. How many times do news reports show people saying, “ You wouldn’t have thought that anything would happen here”? Outside again we couldn’t go in the formal gardens because someone had decided it would be a good idea to have tree felling at the same time as having the attraction of the vintage funfair for the school holidays. Service in the cafe was painfully slow. On the plus side the children’s play area is superb with plenty for all ages. The parkland is vast with many benches for tired legs. Will not be back in a hurry."
Impromptu visit,My fiancé is a huge Batman fan and has spoken a few times about Wollaton Hall being used as the set for Wayne Manor. We headed there over Easter weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how big and clean the grounds are. There were parking issues due to machines not working so we ended up paying via the app to ensure we didn't get a parking fine. I didn't go into the hall as we had our dog with us but the rest of the family went in and there's a lovely museum inside.
Easter visit with friends ,"This is a fantastic park hidden away on edge of city. Visited numerous times for walks around the lake, the wood to spot the deer and walled gardens. There is a very good children’s play park, the house it’s self is a museum  often with good displays to see. Plenty of cafes, ice cream vans etc. Parking is reasonably priced at £5 for the day - I would recommend taking cash as pay machines don’t accept cards."
Great country park and free hall,"Always enjoy a trip to this lovely park, weather it’s snow or sun it’s great for everyone. You can enjoy a picnic have a stroll and spot the deer if you’re lucky. The hall also is a great place for a visit and to have a refreshment etc. If you have never been it’s cetainly worth it just take some change for the parking."
Always a great place to visit,"Interesting (free) museum set in expansive grounds,  with beautiful landscaping, lots of deer and birds. Cafe and shop also on site. Always a good place to visit and they often have other things going on at the hall, like splendour and I think they put on an outdoor theatre. Just a good place to go to, especially if you are showing off Nottingham to guests. I always go to Highfields to go on the boating lake and then get the car/bus to Wollaton Hall. Always makes a good day out!"
Beautiful location,"Tucked away on the edge of Nottingham City centre you can find Wollaton hall & Park, we visited on a almost car park full sunny Saturday, lots of people doing the same as us enjoying the Hall, gardens and park, plenty of areas to walk and explore and why not, the walk to the ware is always splendid and you can forget your in a city, well worth the visit."
Do not miss this!,"Hardwick Hall - more glass than wall so the saying goes, and it is an impressive sight. This historical hall has changing exhibitions to attract visitors on many occasions. The gardens are also a delight in every season.  Beautiful walks around the lake and in the grounds. Do not miss Hardwick Hall even if on a short visit to this area it is well worth the time."
"Worth a visit, children were entertainedre","Visiting Nottingham, whilst passing through, we are big NT members, so this was the nearest to an NT you can get, without any need for any membership or entry admission(only for the industry museum and carpark, all very cheap) this is a council managed property, we were pleasantly surprised what the house had to display within, if you like taxidermy, there really is a truly fascinating collection. The house itself from the outside is very impressive to look at and deer is also on th pe grounds, including a park for children, and cafe and ice cream vans the area itself is surrounding by well to do housing area, it's a nice, feel safe location. And our visit suggested that this is a very popular attraction. If you are in the area, worth a look.If you fancy round the industrial museum just to the side of the house, for a small fee, go and have alook round, there is truly some mind blowing machinery on display, very fascinating, if it were not for the children, I could of spent the day there talking to the guides, they're like a sponge full of detailed information, which is really great. In the wood shed even had, ago on some tools that were over 90years old, yes hands on , brilliant! There is a big display of all things steam, and last Sunday of the month, they start the lot up! Quick go have alook, before it all goes electric !"
Great,We took our granddaughter for a play on the park and a picnic. We had a lovely time at the park and running round on the grass.  It was very busy but we parked easily. We had a wonderful time and will return.
Good for fun and relaxation,"Visited here with the kids and some friends. Had a nice walk around the park, visited the very well equipped play area (with a seating area and coffee stall) looked around Wollaston Hall and played with the Rugby ball on many of the plenty open areas suitable for playing and picnics. Will be coming back in the summer to really enjoy it!!"
Great Sunday morning run,Lovely park with excellent paths. Great for a winter run as not too muddy but beautiful views and mostly flat apart from the large mound/small hill in the middle of the park.
Wonderful grounds,"We had a pleasant walk around the grounds on a crisp, sunny spring day. Lots to look at and we could have spent much longer enjoying the scenery if we had had time. The hall was somewhat disappointing - lame natural history museum and next to no information about the house and its history."
The sound of happy children on a chilly spring day,"This is a beautiful park with lots of space, plenty of car parking ( pay and display), an attractive hall set on a hill, deer roaming free and lovely children’s play area. There are plenty of toilets and we tried the lovely little cafe near the children’s park. I can recommend the bacon sandwiches! There were lots of happy children having fun despite the chilly day. Some brave souls had brought picnics and looked set for a good day out. If you are in or around Nottingham this is definitely worth a visit."
Great Afternoon,"We took the grandkids, had a lovely afternoon, play park hall, shop and café all good. The deer park merits a longer visit and the walk around the lake, well we could not fit it all in in one afternoon. Picnic spaces, good facilities, a modest parking charge, great value. We will return."
Lovely place to walk the dogs,"This park is a lovely place to walk the dogs, I liked the coffee seller near the lake. The grounds are very good but you need to be on the lookout for rabbit and deer poo, unfortunately my dogs like to roll in it. On the whole very nice."
Such beautiful ground and museum... And free,Wollaton  hall is a very magnificent hall in beautiful grounds. The hall is on small hill so you have nice views from around it. There is a natural history museum on two floors with good information about various exhibits. Our grand daughter enjoyed looking at the birds and insect section. Out side in the huge park we saw some deer and at the back of the hall beautiful land scaped garden and lake.
Nice walk and plenty to do.,"Wollaton hall and park was nice and chill. There was a museum, free of charge. There was places to grab tea, coffee etc. There was also at least 2 ice cream Van's situated within the park. There was also plenty of animals about. Theres also deers and squrals around the park."
We loved this,"From the lake to the deer, from wandering the house to the cafe, we really enjoyed our time here. Beautiful place for walking."
Beautiful,So lucky to have this place on my door step.  Had a look around the house for the first time cant believe I didn't sooner so cool.  Cant wait for summer this place will be bliss
WORTH visiting!,"I mean, Wayne's Manor is here! You'd wanna tell people you've visited Batman's house? (And bonus - inside it is a museum!). If you're lucky, you could come across some deers! Very nice place, and there's a lake somewhere. Alot of trees. Peaceful!"
Lovely family visit in relaxing surroundings,"We visited with our family of grown up children. Very accessible to all ages.Facilities great, cafe food delicious!It was wonderful to see the free roaming deer, everyone else enjoying the surroundings."
great family outdoor walk breath fresh air/space,"this is one of the best child friendly place to visit whilst in nottingham.great for walking,beautiful plce to go for a walk"
Love it ,"We have always loved Wollaton Park, however having moved away it has been a while since we last visited.Very impressed with the improvements to this gem of Nottingham. Everything is free, apart from parking.Our young children loved the playground, seeing the deer roam wild and exploring the natural History Museum. This has considerably improved and showcases all the animals very wellThe park is a great escape from city life It is always worth a visit"
 Behind the scenes tour,"For many’s years my wife and I have driven passed Wollaton Hall and said we must visit the hall but never did..…. Until now and I’m so glad we did as it’s a little gem of a place to see. We decided to do the back room tour of the hall and I’m so glad we did and it was the best twenty quid I’ve spent in a long time (£10 each)The tour takes you behind the museum exhibits for a look at life was like in hall for the Elizabethans and Georgians but be warned there are a lot of stairs to climb but the views from one of the rooms is amazing and well worth the money. !!The tour guide was exceptionally knowledgable about the hall, the family for whom it had it built and all it’s history and was quite funny as well which helped as otherwise I’m sure it could be a very dry subject. However saying that it was a most enjoyable experience and I would highly recommend it to those people,like my wife and I who haven’t been to the hall before (or not for a very long time) to take part."
Dirty outside Cafe area,"I visited Wollaton Hall at the weekend to find that the outside cafe area in the courtyard was filthy, with rubbish strewn all over the place.  It needed a good sweep. Also the cafe was very limited in the choice of food on sale, hardly any cakes and this was at lunchtime. There was a shortage of cutlery too and I had to ask for butter and then a member of staff had to really look for some.  This is not the standard I've been used to when I've been there before. It need improvement and modernisation."
Must see,"I would definitely recommend wollaton park and hall. Massive place. Great areas of space to run energy out of the kids(especially if you take a football) ice cream van and outside cafe with great food and drink and the hall is definitely worth a visit with various stuffed animals,fossils,insects and a few rooms decorated with old costumes and info from various stages of history"
An amazing few hours,"We have been coming here since I can remember and it has always been a great visit regardless of what you do. We've been for walks, we've brought remote control toys and kites, we've had picnics, we've come to see the stunning wildlife, we've come sledging, we've come for fun, education and historic visits. We've even been for open days, charity events and concerts. I've even been on an overnight ghost hunt. So much to do. The industrial museum is a great sight too and so much to see and learn. The main house is fantastic for period of all ages too and if yoy ever get to do a behind the scenes tour - take it up... is amazing and you learn so much and see things public don't normally get to see. I'm very sceptical but on an overnight ghost hunt - there were very strange things happening in the room that was once a nursery and you can still smell burning in a part of the turret that eat involved in a fire.... amazing. Then there's the gardens. The glass house is fantastic and authentic and the ponds are mesmerising. The park itself is somthing else. The gardens at the front are based on a large slow hill which is excellent for all kinds of activities and frequently home to fairgrounds and concerts. There is also a large fixed playground and ashtrays am over cream van nearby. Then there's the rear gardens which back on to the golf course and houses a huge lake wick had a lovely interesting walk all the way around. Simply am amazing place for all ages and all interests. There's a small fee for parking, which helps to pay for the up keep of the place and the house and industrial museum entry fee also helps. There's a coupe of cafe's onsite too.A great central location just minutes from the bustling city centre of Nottingham and easily accessible from the ring road and through Wollaton village. Highly recommended venue for everyone. Wheelchairs can easily passel at the top of the hill and get down and around the lake. The main house is also accessible for wheelchairs. A few local bus services call at the front entrance. A few more mainstream services (indigo,i4 and other NCC services) call to the rear of the park - not to mention the Red Arrow and tram stop at the QMC near the side entrance to the park. There are plenty of car parks on site too."
Beautiful,This place is perfect on an autumn afternoon. I went to experience the dinosaurs of China exhibition but have also used the park for running and for walking dogs in the past. It’s completely idyllic and a beautiful escape from busy city just a few miles away!
The best attraction in Nottingham,"A lovely, very clean park with old trees. Around The castle, there is a garden and a glasshouse kept in old-fashioned style. You can seat there and rest a little after a walk. The castle is amazing and inside you can learn about the history of this place."
Interesting and un-expected,"Beautiful venue and surrounding landscapes. Interesting visit, lots of animals which have been collected from the original family back in the 1600-1700s. I really enjoyed reading about the families history and I didn’t quite expect it to have so many different species displayed. It is a little upsetting to see so many animals which have been displayed for viewing purposes but seeing how the museum is working hard to discuss the issues around animal conservation I guess you need to take this into consideration that it will benefit future generations.Definitely worth a visit and would be lovely to have a picnic in the grounds around the summer months, also watch out for the deer which may run pass you at any moment! 😊"
Nice walk on a sunny day,"Nice park and little lake on the grounds. There is an old nature history museum. The house and park is quite well taken care of. Lots of space for a walk or even a jog, kick a ball around."
Fascinating,"Went looking for somewhere to spend the day, before heading off home from our visit to nottingham. This was recommended by the hotel receptionist. Would be better to visit on a sunny day, we visited the museum and i loved seeing all the stuffed creatures. There's so many creatures for you to look at. and rooms tailored for children to do little activities.Museum is featured in a beautiful building with a little section on what the house would have been like when people were living here, it would have been nice to have this as a bigger section but i think it said there's few furniture items etc from when people were living here. Went past a few deer on the way back from the house to the car.Grounds sound pretty extensive so would be able to go on a few walks around in better weather"
Batman,"A nice place for people to visit if they are local to Nottingham. Wollaton Hall, the deer and the spaciousness provide a lovely family day out in the warmer seasons of the year."
trip  out,"lovely walk round the park n lake . icecream if u want one ,plenty of room for dogs just beware of the dear .pay to park didnt mind as park is lovely  didn't go in the hall  .as was busy"
Lovely place to go especially in summer,"Fab place to visit with the kids or family for a picnic in the summer! Great for a long walk around the lake or to sit in one of the many many spots for a picnic, nice to look around the museum and they often have events/festivals or something for young kids on"
Day out,"Took our granddaughters for a day out, very impressed with inside the hall, had a great day...would reccomend to anybody"
Impressive building and grounds,Always an impressive building to look at and the grounds are great to walk through especially round the lake. The cafe in the courtyard is friendly and has great home made cakes with the coffee.
Lovely day out,"Plenty to do here, great for family day out and dogs welcome too.  On a rainy day you can always go in doors and look around the hall and on a sunny day watch the deer"
Amazing place,We went there for a lovely warm walk and it was beautiful. We saw the deers and the walked the length of the park and I must say it's a well kept part and it's good for taking a walk in the sunny weather. i would recommend a visit to unwind
Deer deer ,Wollaton park is a really nice place to take the family i would recommend  to every one families couples it is a lovely building worth a look around very interesting place
Day out,We were looking for somewhere to go and while looking on the web we saw this place and decided to go. It took us just over an hour to get there we paid to park which was £5 but that is all day. We popped the cafe then we drove from the cafe to the hall we could have walked but we couldn't be bordered. We parked in the car park next to the hall and we used the same ticket for parking. We walked around the house and some of its gardens we all really enjoyed it plus it was free to do. When the weather is better we will definitely be visiting again
A+ guided tour,"The tour was excellent, I'm not usually a tour person, but our guide was friendly and entertaining. His knowledge of Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, and the time periods was very impressive. Got to see a lot more of the hall than you normally would. Probably great for kids, but as an adult visiting by yourself, it's definitely worth it too.It's a small world"
Bargain,"Just £3 for parking for the morning gives access to parkland with lake, stable block, formal garden with conservatory and main house. Run by the City of Nottingham it provides a wonderful resource for the people of Nottingham and is popular but not crowded during our Sunday morning visit. The Elizabethan mansion is perched at highest point with views. The building is “tired” and requires some TLC. Inside the house is largely stripped of fixtures finishing and all furniture but is used as a natural history museum great for families with young children. The main double storey hallway is an impressive feature. There is a cafe, industrial museum (not visited) and various outlets where usual and unusual gifts can be found. Would like to revisit to take in some walks in the park."
Loved it!,Beautiful old English style building. With a massive garden free to access. Parking is paid though (3 pounds for 3 hours or 5 pounds all day). On site there is the technical museum. And in the building you can see an exhibition with all sorts of stuffed animals. There are daily tours trough the mansion at 12:00 and 14:00. Its a great place to spent a morning or afternoon when the weather is nice. You can go to one of the little restaurants to buy something to drink or a nice snack.If you are in Nottingham this is a must to see!
Nice day out,"Much more to do then i expected. Technology museum is really awesome. Not too big but then it doesn't get boring too quickly. They would start some of the engines etc. Full of passionate staff, very helpful and ready to tell you a story.Nice great field around for a day out."
Always a great place,"I have visited Wollaton Hall and park many times and I always have a lovely day out.There is a parking charge so make sure you have change! Been on a first date and here and with family toddler and dog. Everyone always enjoys them self!There are two cafe which can get busy, but they offer take out drinks."
Sunny walk,"Beautiful place to walk, think, talk or take photos. Wonderful wildlife and the hall & gardens are well worth a visit."
Lovely day for a visit,"Decided to go to Wollaton Hall as haven’t been for quite a while, and it’s still as I remember. Lovely walk round the grounds of the hall, then stopped in the cafe for a bite to eat. Didn’t see any deer today, but the golfers were out enjoying a game of golf. The hall was very informative with various stuffed animals and insects. Also there is a big lake and a play area for children. Very enjoyable on a very mild February day."
Beautiful but avoid on a Saturday afternoon,"Stopped off at Wollaton Park on our way home after a city break in Nottingham. Blue skies made for some great pictures. Inside the hall there is fascinating taxidermy and we enjoyed reading about lots of different birds and wildlife. As it was a Saturday the place was overrun with kids which on the one hand is great that they are learning about wildlife but at the same time it did feel like we were on a school trip with the amount of excitable youngsters constantly squealing, pushing in, banging on the display cabinets and charging round the place. Not the halls fault, more the parents. If you want some peace and quiet to get the most out of this fascinating place then go early (probably on a weekday) and before the crowds."
Fantastic family day out,Stumbled across this place by accident. Only costs £5 to park for the whole day and no other entrance fee. Huge grassed areas for children (and dogs) to run around or to stop for a picnic. Large lake - you can buy duck food for £1 a bag. Natural history museum and industrial museum which we sadly didn't have time to go in. Play area and a couple of cafes. There are wild deer here as well although we didn't see any. We will definitely be going again for a day out
Beautiful Grounds ,"My wife and I went with some friends as we had never been before. What a fabulous place. The grounds were beautiful and walked all the way around the lake. The weather was perfect which added to the joy. Didn't have time to visit the hall, but enjoyed my day."
Great day out,"Park, garden and Hall really enjoyable on a sunny day.Natural history exhibits in the Hall are interesting and well worth a visit Cafe disappointing, arrived at 11:52 and asked for a sausage baguette and was refused as “we don’t do hot food till 12:00” and the person serving was fairly abrupt 🤬"
Excellent place to go,I have lived near here all my life. I still love visiting at least one a month. It’s free. It’s a genuine property with an excellent museum. Loads of grounds and things to do. There is even a lake. All you pay for is parking and food.
Great Family Day Out,Took my Sister in law and her two girls to here for their first time ever. They really enjoyed it with lots of things to see and photograph. The grounds were wonderful and the enjoyed the unusual play park located by the entrance with it being a particularly mild day for February.
Nice Park,"Great Park. The deer viewing is amazing. The Industrial Museum is a recommended. It shows the different modes of transport in Nottingham and the different energies/factory during the 1800s till now. Great Place to have a walk, picnic spot or Archery SpotDuring Summer, outdoor cinema is definitely something to try!"
Visit to Wollaton Hall,The day we visited the hall it was quite enlightening in as much it is excellent to see how people used to keep exotic animals.
Lovely visit,Had a lovely time wandering around these beautiful grounds and going inside the natural history museum. Fascinating collections in there.
A lovely destination if visiting Nottingham for first time,"I have been here on multiple occasions with friends and family. Even through sunshine or snow, its a lovely location to stroll. It is also a good spot to do some photography. The first time I visited here I was unaware that you could venture inside of the building and that there was a wildlife museum. It is lovely inside! A definite must visit if you are new to the Nottingham area."
Great park for all the family ,"We are local to Nottingham We love visiting the park because it’s a big expanse to walk our pooch, especially around the large lake. The car park gets busy but you never seem to be on top of each other Lovely in all weathers and enjoy spotting the wild deer."
Lovely walk,Went here to have a walk around not been for about 15 years and it’s not changed much . It was a lovey day so busy
Amazing Dog walk,Wollaton park is one of my favourite places in Nottinghamshire we take the grandchildren there sometimes on a Saturday and they love the museum and never get bored of it. On a Sunday it is great for taking the dog on a lovely walk around the lake. All the other dog walkers are so friendly and it is so clean. The cafe is a great place to sit and chat and the staff are so friendly. Give it a visit also the museum is donations on entry. Love it
Classic Nottingham Landmark,"Been coming here for years since I was a child.These grounds have been hosts to various festivals, events and numerous family reunions.Catch this place on a lovely summer day and there's few places in the city that beat it.Lovely experience to witness the botanical gardens and admiring the herds of stags and does."
8.1.2019,I visited Wollaton Hall and Park with my UK friend on 8.1.2019.  The hall is full of amazingly interesting nature displays.  The grounds are huge with a lake which we walked around.  There are many live deer to see grazing in the park.  The toilet facilities were clean.  The coffee shop at the stable served some welcome warm coffee and tea with lovely cake.  Just the thing after a walk on a chilly winters day.
Day to remember,"If Nottingham is your destination for time out especially with children then Wollaton Hall is a must go place.Great museum with plenty to see, excellent park land to walk round and especially the lake to look back at the view.Great cafeteria and also gardens at the back of hall.Roaming dear to watch for and plenty of parking.Don't miss out on this fabulous attraction"
Tour of Wollaton Hall,We went round with Sandra who made the Hall come alive!  We went up to the Prospect Room and down to the kitchens and the tunnels beyond.  Really wonderful tour which we highly recommend.  Thanks so much
Lovely park,"Always love coming to Wollaton Park. A beautiful park that you can wonder around. Also good for taking the dogs out, my little terrier loves it."
First rate attraction a must to visit.,"As a visitor to Nottingham the last thing I was considering was a visit to a park way out if the City centre. However, take my advice if you don't have a car; download the Nottingham City Transport app and you can get to almost anywhere in the city and its suburbs real cheap.Example is that we were a group of five, two adults and three children ranging from 17 to 3. I purchased the Group Rider ticket for £5 and that covered all of us all day on all NCT buses. The app is fantastic, your ticket is on your phone, you can plan your journey, so we took the No 30 Pink Line bus to the gates of Wollaton Park... it's actually closer to the city centre than you think!At Wollaton Park, the Hall is a good walk away and uphill, but well worth the effort. And, what's more, it's free to enter. There is a myriad of rooms to visit covering everything from the hall's history through to natural history.....kids and adults of all ages will love it. Just below the house is the Courtyard with a smuttering of small shops and cafes.All in all a great day out on a winters day was had by my family and me and what's more, it only cost me the price of the bus ticket, cost a drinks and cakes all round, and tge entrance fee to tge Industrial Museum located in tge Courtyard...and that place is another must, so a cheap day out which in turn gives great value considering tge kids get to do loads of activities...as do the adults :)"
Awesome View,Walking around the park was a great experience when i first arrived at Nottingham. The Hall was a great view as well. The change of seasons brings different scenery to the park itself. If you're lucky you may see deers around!
Out with grandkids,A wet and windy day but we enjoyed running around in the open. Clean park and play area. Good playground for children. Wollaton Hall was very interesting & a lovely touch to have the storyteller for the children. Kept them spellbound. Cafe staff helpful . Easy to park even though a busy day.
Room for improvement,"To start the park is just spectacular and just amazing to go for a walk on a Sunday afternoon. No complaints there. Sadly the deers in the park where in the golf course so no visitor could really get a close look. But that is understandable. However the Wollaton hall, although magnificent and also free to enter, can improve. I personally believe that, just like London Science Museum, there should be a reception area where to enter guests can give a donation of any amount to continue in keeping the place running. Secondly, if maybe some tours where to be offered at certain hours at a cost, it would be beneficial also. unless you read some leaflets of the Wollaton hall, there is little to no information about the history of the place (except for the Cassandra room). I know the place is famous for its Batman-Bruce Wayne manor celebrity status but i really hope that maybe with a little investment the place could actually teach guests about the history of the hall and not just be a collection of natural history."
Let's flaunt a bit on social media with Mr. Bruce Wayne !,"Spanned in a huge area, its a beautiful park with large ground and forests. At the centre of the park stands the grand mansion which was the home of Batman in Batman Begins. Yes, Mr Wayne lived here for Nolan. Inside the mansion is the museum with areas dedicated to minerals, insects, wildlife, natural sciences and birds. Also, it's not huge which you would be tired to watch or would not be able to complete in a couple of hours. After visiting the museum, calm yourself in the enormous park. A good place to have a nice family or friendly picnic. Word of advice - Do have a raincheck before going here. In pleasant weather, this place is heavenly, at least for the peace-seekers."
Generally ok,"I've grown up in Wollaton and having now moved away I return occasionally taking my two young daughters for a visit to the park. The play area is rather disappointing, with a vast amount of space the play area seem restrictive and even for a new years sunny day when many family's wish to wrap up and go out to work off a bit of Christmas stodge there was not enough apparatus to fulfil childrens needs and we found we doesn't most of our time waiting for something to become free. The larger climbing frame up on a mound personally for my children was rather dicey, high and inadequate ground should a fall happen especially with older children pushing their way past younger ones. Certainly prefer markeaton park in respect of this. Other than that the hall has been maintained well and the gardens, also nice to take a stroll around the lake. Staff in the courtyard cafe could be more attentive and helpful safe to say they were lacking a tad with customer service. But the additional cafe by the playpark is certainly an advantage."
Thoroughly enjoyable,"Beautiful grounds that included a good sized lake to walk around. Ample free parking with Dogs were welcome in all shops and cafe, which was a welcome change."
Tour,"Today we did the tour of the hall.We loved it.Sandra was our guide and she was super. Knowledgeable and friendly. She took us to spaces you don't usually see and shared stories of the hall and people who lived their as well as stories about the locality.The hall, gardens and deer park etc are free, just pay for parking. Then a fee of £10 for the tour, well worth every penny. And if it goes towards looking after this beautiful building then I will happily pay again.Enjoy it. So did our visiting Australian friends.Thanks Sandra"
A hidden gem in the middle of everywhere! ,Great for a walk and coffee. Spectacular Tudor mansion (unusually set out as a natural history museum) and easily accessible lake for an easy pleasant walk. Great for kids too (incl. adventure playground) and all free. We got sensibly close to a group of magnificent deer and spotted a colony of herons on an island on the lake. The equivalent of a flagship National Property yet unusually run by the City Council (well done them). A terrific free resource for anyone and everyone and great for dogs too.
Wollaton Hall,Great outing for the family. Nice lovely walks if you want to de-stress. Lovely gardens behind the hall. Great for bike rides. Always some events going on for all ages. Always a lovely day out.
Xmas treat,"We visited Wollaton hall this time without fog or snow for our Xmas walk, its always a pleasure to visit anytime of year to have wander around the water & woods, always plenty of people, bring money for the car park."
Batman’s house,"Great park, grounds and house. Never found the bat cave though. The lake and all the different walks mean you could go there and never walk the same path. There are deer, shops, cafes and toilets. Great day out."
More Than Batman,"Came to visit on a day trip to Nottingham, purely for the Batman reference, but left having enjoyed a visit to the Natural History Museum as well as a wander through the pretty park, where I was delighted to see so many deer roaming freely. Well worth a visit, particularly on a dry day, though the indoor museums are worth a look too."
Super Saturday Stroll,Visiting in Nottingham we decided to get out of boys for a breath of fresh air so headed to Wollaton Hall for a stroll around the estate and stately hall. Lovely surroundings; plenty of birds and squirrels around but unfortunately no deer or stags around on this crisp morning. The hall itself is a fascinating place and the surrounding cafe and courtyard are very nice too. So lovely to find such a wonderful place in the centre of a bustling city.  Well worth a visit .
New year's day walk.,Lovely place to walk round and enjoy the surroundings of park and lake area.Disappointed to see adults were allowing their children to get so close to the stags in the park. Fortunately the park ranger was there.
Scenic walk,Beautiful House and gardens had a walk around the lake absolutely fantastic to take a picnic in the summertime.
Pleasant winters stroll ,"We hadn’t been here for years , however we had a nice walk around on a sunny winters day .Car park £3 for 3 hours or £5 all day , signposting could have better around the park as we were not sure which path to take sometimes .In the courtyard there are a couple of relevant shops plus a cafe - on the surface the cafe was very nice however a bit pricey eg £3 for a toasted tea cake ! Coffee normal cafe pricing but it wasn’t anything special .Not many deer around on the day of our visit just a few under a tree on the adjoining golf course ."
Kids love it here ,"Lovely for a day out or to come with a picnic in the summer. Always nice to see the stationary steam engine in full steam, I believe this is the one that was saved from Sherwood, Nottingham when they were scrapped. Great place ❤️"
No deer in the winter,"Although people say there are lots of red deer in this park, I didn't see any. Maybe because it was too cold and humid, the deer were hiding somewhere. The park is big but there's nothing special to see. The design of the park is too simple.Wollaton Hall is currently a natural history museum, and the building beside it is an industrial museum. Both museums are small, so you don't need to spend too long there. One of the rooms in Wollaton Hall shows the history of the building and the family which lived there, and this room looks very interesting."
A real surprise ,"An historic house set in extensive beautiful grounds in Nottingham. Really enjoyed wandering around the grounds. House was interesting, it is a shame more of the original features are not preserved in the interiors, but it had an unusual historical ‘dead zoo’ collection of animals and birds."
Nice walk around the park,Lovely grounds to wander around with good views in all directions. The park is large with plenty of routes to explore.
Walk and feeding the ducks with added history,Great to have 5h8s place on our doorstep. We have always enjoyed going here with our teens as babies and with our dog. Now the girls are teens we don't go as much as a family but still enjoy this hall and the gardens
Seeing our local heritage,"We often don’t visit what is on our doorstep, I regularly walk around this park through to Bramcote lane shops , A nice length of excercise to get the daily steps up. Some great views and the deer never fail to mesmerise me. A great place to have a kick around with the ball , swans and geese a plenty on the lake and a nice coffee shop with outside seating for people with dogs. Huge car park if needed and if you want a different coffee shop try the Bramcote lane eateries for a change. Worth spending an afternoon here in the summer with a picnic."
Christmas school holidays with my grandson ,"Lived in nottingham all my life.,visited many times. Loved taking my 3yr od grandson today.paid £3 in carpark.but the hall was free to visit.thoroughly enjoyed yourselves,made more perfect memory's."
Nice place to walk,"We walk our dogs here quite often and have been visiting since I was a child. We love it, it's a nice long walk all the way around and the deers and gardens are kept beautiful. The only downside is even though there are lots of signs saying no dogs off lead there are too many people who ignore this rule!"
Poor state of the hall & gardens,"Visited today for our New Year’s Day walk and was shocked to see the vandalism and state of the parks grounds.Smashed windows on the beautiful halls gardens side and the fish pond empty and sundial damaged. Please please please get some lottery funding to bring the hall and gardens back to what they looked like 20 years back.Some cameras might be a good idea to reduce the vandalism, ( Name & Shame) would soon give you the culprits names."
Amazing place,It has been a couple of years since I went but was so enjoyable the grounds are immense the gardens well tended and there is a play area for children. The hall itself is well worth looking around
