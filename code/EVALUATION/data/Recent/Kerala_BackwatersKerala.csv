Amazing trip on government boat.,"We took the government day boat up the backwaters for 8 hours and got off in Alappuzha.    It was amazing.  The boat was basic but had a WC [üëç], it was cheap given the length of journey and the scenery was breathtaking.  I found the boat very comfortable but if you have a bony bum, you might want a cushion. There are two stops for a snack and a larger meal.  These cost extra but are still very cheap.  I felt safe on the boat and the staff were helpful.  Definitely worth the trip although keep your stay in Alappuzha to one night.  It‚Äôs a revolting place.  It‚Äôs a shame because architecturally it‚Äôs interesting but if you‚Äôre a lone female traveller then keep it short!‚Ä¶"
Fabulous experience,"Fabulous experience and a big shame only one night! Five of us enjoyed our overnight experience cruising around the backwaters. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing people drink, wash themselves and crockery, swim and fish in the waters. Learnt that our experience was the last one due to COVID19 closing down the country.....‚Ä¶"
Fantastic,"absolutely brilliant would not have missed this experience for anything, our boat had everything you would want , ensuite facilities, bedroom is smallish but you cant expect anything else, storage in the room is minimal but adequate, but the experience of  the sail, the scenery and most of the food, oh my, there were 3 staff on our boat, 1 chef the other 2 did the cleaning, navigation , etc , they were fantastic and how the chef manages to produce such food is beyond us, the variety , fish from the river , prawns, curries i could go on , this is not to be missed , if you want alcohol you have to provide your own otherwise its all provided , we took a village walk one day, we had a 2 night stay its a must‚Ä¶"
the highlight of our tour,"We had our own houseboat with 3 staff. The food was delicious , the accommodation good and we only wished we had had 2 nights rather than one. Early March not so many boats on the waterways. A really glorious experience"
Used Kerala Tours - excellent,"Arranged via Trailfinders, this private overnight trip was a huge success. If you go to Kerala, it surely is a must-do. This company is based in Alappuzha . I suggest making your trip as soon as you can though. Huge numbers of extra boats are being built to increase all the operators' capacity and I fear the waterways may seem less serene in a few years. As it was, we only saw much of other boats at the very start and finish.  We had the whole 2-cabin boat with 3 staff to ourselves, which was amazing. Our cabin was surprisingly roomy for a small boat and beautifully presented with lots of wood in the traditional way. The shower room was more basic but fine. Everything was spotlessly clean. Smaller boats always have to manage water carefully but it was OK. The dining/lounge area was covered but open at the sides and very comfortable. You could see out just as well from the table as from the sofa. Cushions were arranged at he prow for sitting outside comfortably. When we moored for the night it was in a secluded spot, scenic and very quiet. We were warned about mossies, but encountered fewer on the boat than in towns.  All meals were included and of a very high standard. If only we could have finished everything! They are not licensed, but a nice touch was a gift of a bottle of beer and wine with dinner, which the law permits. The staff were attentive, but not too much so, and very happy to make everything perfect for us. While cruising, the driver would point out features and adjust his course to help get good photos. We had a short shore visit to stretch our legs and see a lovely Syrian Christian church and an artist in wood carving at work.‚Ä¶"
Would recommend...,"Our houseboat experience was with Beautiful Alleppey Houseboat for 1 night. We booked on their website.It was a really nice stay. We opted for the super deluxe which provided 6 hours of cruising. Boat looked like photos. Good food. Nice bedroom and bathroom. Clean. We did drive very slowly, so I didn't feel like we covered much of the backwaters (other boats were driving past us). What I liked about this company is that it was very clear on the website what to expect regarding food, the itinerary of your time on the boat and setting your expectations, and that's why I chose them. We ""docked"" twice, for lunch and at 5pm for the night. After lunch and in the morning I had to prompt them to start moving again, I'm not sure how long we would have continued to dock had I not spoken up (there's only 6 hours of cruising and I wanted to make the most of them). We then only cruised for 35 minutes instead of 1 hour in the morning. Bed was uncomfortable- very soft and memory foam so felt like part of my body was sinking.But I would use them again.Varkala"
Wonderful backwater experience,We booked our houseboat through our tour operator. We had concerns initially to stay overnight as we had come across the negative experiences. But our experience as extraordinary. We had a neat one cabin boat with an upper sitting area for us. The staff was excellent and the wonderful food as well! It was very peaceful and lovely to cruise through the backwater canals and villages. We recommend this cruise and would suggest not to miss it.
10 Neight 11 day kerla Trip*****,"Renu,thank you so much for a well organized trip. We had a wonderful time. Hard to believe it's already done and past. Weather was awesome, the hotels were nice, thank you for everythingTrip was awesome , driver was very kind and a very good guide also , he provide us all information about each and every place . Vinod is also very nice person to coordinate with , he understand our requirement and support at every point .Thanks Renu Nd GOGeO Holidaysüíê"
Enjoyable ,"Good backwaters trip with attentive organisers, very quick at replying and organising! Boat driver knew his way round and showed us a lot about local life. Food was basic but tasty Sri Lankan breakfast and lunch!"
Languid and Interesting!,"Two couples on a former rice barge, with good food and lots to see as we floated the Kerala backwaters.  A fascinating, easy journey -- seeing exotic birds and observing local people as they went about their everyday chores.  It was like watching a travel program on TV, only here we were actually a part of it.  Recommend."
A GREAT SAILING EXPERIENCE,"It was really a great experience to sail through the Backwaters. Nice Quiet Water, Great Views all around,  Good Double-Decker Boat,  Helpful Pilot and Staff. Had a great time."
No words,"Outstanding, amazing, awesome, incredible, you choose your own words.  A trip along the backwaters on to the lake with a well stocked houseboat containing food cooked expertly by your personal chef and a cool box of beer makes your trip along the canals and waterways simply stunning.  Go as a group, impress a loved one or simply go alone and feel like royalty.  This was clearly my highlight of my trip to India.  Simply stunning and very well priced.  Don't even think about it, just find a company, look to pay around 12000 rupees for a good standard boat for two people and let the scenery do the rest."
peaceful location,"Very peaceful although quite busy. You have the opportunity to see locals at work, fishermen and people working in the paddy fields . We saw quite a few birds although difficult to photography as the boat is moving. We spent 2 nights could have asily spent 3 nights"
Serenity on the water,A lovely way to relax after the hustle and bustle of Cochin! Crew were flexible and accommodating to our wishes. Food on board was simple and delicious.We were expecting to be devoured by mosquitoes but not a problem.Highly recommended
Overnight on Prasanthy Houseboats Alleppey,"We spend a day and night in this house boat. It was a great experience for me and my family. Boat was also pretty clean and safe to stay. Not to mention the food was excellent ,extra points for the famous ""Kakka roast"" (clam curry)  and ""karimeen fry"". Highly recommended for those who looking for a nice one day overnight cruse on the backwaters of Alleppey (Kuttanad)."
Pleasant Stay!,"It was a very nice and comfortable stay on the Southern Panorama Cruise. Rooms were very nicely designed with soothing ambience. Staff was extremely courteous and well mannered. They ensured to provide all the amenities to us and for my infant child. Food was finger licking good, with candle light dinner. One advice when you are travelling with your kids....go for premium room as its AC is operational for full time, which very much required in humid climate. This facility can also be checked during the check-in, which is based on availability. Overall it was a excellent experience!!"
"Old, ratty boat but good crew","Old, ratty boat but good crew who tried hard to make the ‚Äúcruise‚Äù comfortable. Food was basic and good. Extra point for the fabulous spicy pan fried kingfish. Air conditioned cabins made the night tolerable. I was disappointed that we didn‚Äôt get to travel down the celebrated narrow waterways but it was only a single overnight cruise. Oh ... the traffic on the river was just as hectic and chaotic as on surface streets."
A excellent relaxing trip.,"We spent a day on a houseboat slowly cruising around this truely unique water delta area. It is a glimpse into another part of South Infia, a waterery jungle one minute then a cultivated rice paddy the next. It is very peaceful experience and gives you a chance to see local rural Indian life, from fishermen catching there daily meal to kids and adults washing there clothes and themselves in the waters. It is also bird watchers paradise with numerous species making this waterland there home. This is something different and we are really glad we went and experienced it."
Goodearth Houseboat and Village Ways Holiday,"I have only seen one other review on Goodearth Houseboat and that from 2015; our experience was completely different; it was superb. In the 3 days cruising on the quiet backwaters we saw no other tourists, at each stop the village tour was delightful and the cookery demonstration when the ladies came aboard fun and informative.We stayed in 4 VillageWays village house locations, plus some other short stops arranged by the company during our extended holiday in Kerala. All experiences were first rate. We did not however sign up for a 5 Star Hotel tour with the same bland hotel room encounter wherever you stay. On our VillageWays experience we met and were hosted by genuine people, farmers, fishermen, local craftsmen and their families. Our tour guides, drivers and super cooks were local people who proudly showed us the real India, their produce, authentic cooking, their homes and countless new experiences.  We made 3 enjoyable train trips, and many road transfers, at each stage we were met on cue and hosted by wonderful people. The VillageWays accommodation was clean, comfortable, more than adequate and the food prepared to a quality restaurant standard by the ladies of each village house we stayed in, and the crew when on Goodearth. If we had any queries our tour organiser, Madhu, was easy to contact. When we wanted to tailor or adjust our programme before and during the holiday, she was attentive and efficient.I can highly recommend the VillageWays experience particularly if you want to see authentic India and ensure fair payment to your hosts, rather than profits to a multinational hotel chain."
Stay in hotel I stead of houseboat,"Me and my husband with 2 year old child spend our stay at houseboat. Sightseeing is very beautiful and worth a visit but our stay is not very pleasant. We have booked a premium Houseboat still the experience is not good. It's not very clean. There is a lot of dust under and behind the bed. Water used in washroom is very salty and dirty (of black color) and No hot water for bathing. Houseboats are only good for sightseeing, it's better to stay in the resort/hotel."
Very relaxing...,"We had a fantastic day and overnight experience with Pickadly on our 2 bedroom houseboat. Such a relaxing experience sailing along the waters. Johnny and the boys looked after us with a fab lunch, snacks and a great breakfast. Wish we'd booked two nights and we could have had a‚Ä¶"

Amazing experience,We took a two hour boat tour in the Backwaters close to Kumerakom.  Our guide was Shaji who knew all the birds we saw and gave us a beautiful ride through the Backwaters.  It was beautiful and one of the highlights of our trip.  We saw so many lotus flowers - several different‚Ä¶
Wonderful scenery and fantastic for people watching but can be congested,"Spending time on the backwaters and sleeping on a converted rice barge is usually number one on the list if you are visiting Kerala, and there were certainly hundreds of these boats bobbing around when we were there.

Stunning Kerala Backwaters,We wanted to spend some days on the Backwaters. Our travel agent booked us a premium houseboat through River and Country Tours Allepey. The houseboat was huge.

Horrible stay... ,"We had a one night stay at the house boat... we were a family of 4, the house boat was booked via our tour agency... the boat itself looked horrible requiring refurbishment... there where 3 rooms in our boat, 2 occupied by us & 1 by the boat crews.

Wonderful Three-Day Cruise,"We had a wonderful three day cruise on a converted rice barge run by CGH group‚Äôs Spice Coast - a company I would highly recommend.

Spice Coast Houseboats,Our houseboat was so much more comfortable than expected.

Gogeo Holidays - Terrible experience,"Gogeo committed to proved 3 star hotels but provided 1 or zero star hotels which had bedbugs, hotels located in jungle areas with no access to basic facilities.

Relaxing overnight stay,We booked through our tour organizer (Arrivago) which we found through the hotel we were staying in Kochi.

So much rubbish and bad experience with house boat,Looks great in the pictures but up close there is so much rubbish.

Cruise and overnight stay on a Spice Routes House Boat,"Part of a Saga tour of Northern and Southern India. Boats typically have 3 berths for 2 people each. Our boat was Cinnamon and it is one of life's great experiences. The air conditioned lounge and dining area was a star feature, and the constant flow of food from our dedicated kitchen staff was fabulous. The large lake area has lots of boats visible but once in the Backwaters it was quiet, relaxing, and totally unique. Much like boating in Thailand with all the palm trees, and locals washing, and washing up in the lagoons and canals."
Twenty four hours,This will not be as helpful as it should as I don‚Äôt remember the two men‚Äôs names  who owned the house boat. We joined the boat at Alappuzha at noon. . As we joined I thought twenty four might not be enough but we packed so much into that time. We enjoyed lunch dinner bed and breakfast onboard.  The scenery was delightful. We enjoyed the bird life along the way. This is well worth doing.
Bridges and Balloons,"We traveled to the Backwaters from kochi expecting a boat ride through a town. Everything was WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED. Kabeer was amazing. We ended up showing up a little late and Kabeer was nothing more than welcoming. The boat was incredibly clean and comfortable. The boat driver answered all of our questions and was more than happy to take pictures for us. We even asked for the bathroom and he stopped at a restaurant for us, while the driver cracked some coconuts for us to drink. The ride through the backwaters was incredibly relaxing. I would recommend this to any family looking for a nice time. We ate before we came. Next time we would definitely like to stop for some fresh fried fish. I would recommend this trip to anyone in the area!"
Salmon Tours half day,"There really isn't much more I can say about this tour that previous visitors haven't already said. It's all absolutely true. Peter is as helpful, funny and knowledgeable a guide as everybody says. We had a fantastic half day out on the backwaters, taking in the sights, learning about the wildlife, plants and the local way of life, and just generally enjoying ourselves. At lunch time, we stopped at Crab Island and had a few snacks, and learnt how to make rope from coconut husks from a lovely couple. I can't recommend this tour enough. Fantastic."
Tranquil and relaxing,"Friday 29th November and we took a boat trip along part of the backwaters of Kerala. Our journey commenced at Manakunnam and we travelled down the Muvattupuzha River and it's tributaries.There was nothing motorised on the boat, we were punted along by 2 boatmen with their poles. No surprise it was a slow and relaxing journey which took about 3 hours to travel about 6 kilometres. There were 16 tourists and a guide on boardAlong the way we stopped at a tiny village where we saw traditional ways, still being used, to produce goods using materials provided by the coconut trees. We saw dried leaves being braided/platted to make roofing panels and making baskets.We also saw the process of extracting the fibres from the coconut and then being spun to produce coir rope.The scenery and landscape was initially very appealing but after a while it all became a bit samey and monotonous. We saw little of no wildlife and very few birds.At the end of the journey, back where we started from, we were given a vegetarian lunch consisting of several local dishes, pumpkin and pineapple curry was the nicest.We did enjoy the tranquility and the relaxation along the journey, 3 hours was definitely long enough for us."
Must visit atleast once in lifetime,Paid visit to this place as I have been hearing a lot since childhood.The ride in the backwaters gives u joy and the scenes around take you to another world.
Kerala Trip - Best cab driver,"We visited Kerala from 22 to 29 of November 2019. Our trip was kochi-munnar-thekkaday-allepay-kovalam-kanyakumari-kochi. This review is for the cab person named SIBI.

Backwaters houseboat day trip!,"Amazing day trip in Kumarkom and Alleppey. Anup scheduled an excellent pickup, houseboat, and driver. We had a great time relaxing on the boat and we even stopped by a fish market to buy fresh fish and prawns that were cooked on the boat."
Amazing experience,We sent the owner a message on theur website. He replied within 10 mins and we booked it for the next day. We stayed on a 1 bedroom boat. It was really lovely kept up to date. Immaculately clean. Beds really comfortable and linen like new. The boat had a private ensuite bathroom‚Ä¶
Gogeo holidays,GoGeoKerala tourism provides one of the best experiences when it comes to Kerala Trips. We had planned for a 5 day trip and the Tour Executive (Renu) was very helpful from the beginning to the end. The driver (Arun) provided was very cooperative and guided us through out the trip. The Hotels and house boats provided was of top class. If any of you are planning for a Kerala trip you can go ahead and book it via GoGeo. It was a splendid time in Kerala. A must try Tour.
Why Not Houseboat ,"We spent a night on Why Not Houseboat in November and couldn‚Äôt recommend enough. They have 3 different boats but we booked the premium one. We went down to the ship yard the morning of the trip and it was the nicest boat we saw by far. The guys were easy to deal with a book through. The boat has a top deck which is lovely, a shower, comfy bed, air conditioning. The food was the best we‚Äôve had in Kerala - the chef is fantastic! The only criticism was that for whatever reason the bedroom ceiling was flaking so the bed ended up with sand like particles on it. Annoying when trying to sleep. Seen quite a lot of people saying they‚Äôd struggle for two nights but we‚Äôre in our 30‚Äôs and could have done another day - it‚Äôs the most relaxing thing we‚Äôve done on our trip so far."
Fascinating trip lovely people,"A group of us met in Trivandrum Airport, welcomed by our driver and guides and travelled by cycle throughout the backwaters visiting Cochin, Kovalum, Kottayam and Varkala amongst other wonderful places.My second trip to India the first being in 1995 to Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Agra. Wonderful experience again with the weather being quite dry for June and some great memories to share by my photos."
Beautiful,"This was our second trip to Cochi and houseboat on backwaters. we enjoyed our trip the first time.This time our travel agency put us on houseboat run by >>Pulickattil house boats. The boat itself was dirty, disgusting. I will share some photos I took to show how dirty it was. The cook was good.when the houseboat was parked for the night...people from other boats used it as a passage way to cross from one boat to the other while we were eating dinner. It was parked in a place where we could see people taking bath at night and then brushing their teeth in the morning. Over all it was not a very good experience. I would not recommend this company."

"Sit back, relax and feel the stress and strain drain away","Sit back, relax and feel the stress and strain drain away.  The only sounds are the gentle lapping of water against the hull of your ricebarge and bird calls, and what a number and different birds there are!  And, at the end of the day, a spectacular sunset.  There is no better way to spend a couple of days away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Kerala than on its Backwaters."
Amazing,"On our tour to Kerala we stayed overnight on the blue jelly houseboat, the chefs were fantastic, the food was amazing.

Spice Coast Cruise - Simply Fantastic,Thank you to our superb crew who gave us the trip of a lifetime. We felt very looked after and welcomed. We have never tasted such great food. We have some wonderful memories and photos of life from the Backwaters.

And my personal opinion about him, overall he is a helpful person and very confident in what he is doing.- About the Boat -This place is really awesome and value for money. They well maintained their place as per guest's satisfactions.- Food -It's extremely good and the best ever in Kerala. They are preparing according to guest's requirements.Surely I will consider on appointing them as my panel. Well done guys!! Good job done and, may you keep it up. Thank you."
Peacful,I did this trip with a few other people from my resort. First of all the amount of plastic in the water is heartbreaking and glass bottles. It‚Äôs s nice relaxing way of seeing the backwaters. The boat driver was on his cellphone most of the time. Saw quite a lot of different birds.
Shree krishna houseboat is a Nightmare,"Houseboat is the last thing you want to do in kerala specially in early june.If you hate someone then send them for houseboat. It was damn hot and everything is focused on commercializing rather than service.There were two staff in the boat and were unprofessional, Captain and helper. Captain was very lazy, boat sailed for 30 min and he wanted to take a break of one and half hour and later they lure you by telling us that there are some good prawns on the way which will again waste more time and further to that they have commissions with ayurveda centers on the way which were not authentic as well there also we wasted one and half hour. This all was adjustable, but main thing started when the boat was anchored at an island, island actually sounds very fascinating but trust me it is not. They had neumorous AC in the boat But hardly few were functional and houseboat rules are that if you want to use AC in rooms you can't turn on in dining area. Regardless, i had a room next to engine unfortunately and it was stinking with petroleum and AC in that room was not functional, it was nightmare to sleep there. In the morning it was sailed for sometime and it was docked at 8 am.Cleanliness : it was very bad, Ants and spiders were crawling around. Bathroom had webs and there was no ventilation. My Personal Advice : if you really want to enjoy houseboat then hire professional ones or just get day cruise, night cruise is nightmare. Regardless you are planning to go then carry your own toiletries, towels and tissues."
A quiet gateaway,I took the backwater ride for two nights. The first night stop was near a village. The ride was serene and tranquil. You will be transported to another time and place. The food was great. The captain and the cook on board made the delicious meals. It was wonderful and you can share a romantic time with a loved one.
Kerala backwaters,"It was a nice experience. We went through the backwaters in a boat. It was a nice experience. We saw few birds. The sceneries were excellent.

"The Oberoi Houseboat, Vrinda","We decided that the best way to see the backwaters was by staying on board the Oberoi Houseboat, MV Vrinda.

Absolutely a fabulous experience on a perfectly appointment houseboat,"We boarded Spice Route Luxury Cruises, our boat is Clove from Kummarakon Lake Resort.  Air Conditioned ... what a luxury, then we find we have double beds and modern en-suite bathrooms with toilettries.  We even have wifi, compliments of a wifi dongle!  Instead of one big boat, we opted for smaller ones, so our group are on a total of 4 boats called Tamarind, Clove, Cinnamon & Fennel.  We no sooner depart at midday, when we are served with lunch at a dining table suitable for 6, which was a delicious meal.  During the afternoon, we cruise down Vembanad Lake, then into the canals.  By late afternoon we moor side by side and our crews combine to provide a wonderful dinner for all 13 of us. The AirCon is important, because it is just so humid.  Early morning we are off and breakfast is served ... was a fantastic experience, one I would definitely recommend using Spice Route Luxury Cruise."
MV Vrinda - a most wonderful houseboat,"The Oberoi associated MV Vrinda is a luxury cruising houseboat on the Kerala backwaters. It‚Äôs accomodation is spacious and air-conditioned with great wifi. The daily excursions and cultural activities are low-key and interesting. But mostly it is the attentive, polite and personable staff and crew that make the experience what it is. After the mayhem and hectic routine of Mumbai, this was a beautiful and relaxing detox from traffic, pollution and crowds! A 3 night excursion was long enough to find peace. There are many houseboats to choose from; if you are looking for a little luxury, this is a recommended choice."
Excellent,Awesome experience in boat house üòç..good is very tasty and the arrangements are very cool... very much Happy to share this as this is the most memorable experience
Spice coast cruises,"We had a wonderful trip (1N) with this one bedroom houseboat, very good organized, excellent cuisine, friendly crew, good to know is that they have an island where they dock for the night . A bit strange was that for lunch they docked too instead of continuing the trip. But overall a great experience !!"
Spice Coast cruises - wonderful journey,"We had two nights on a one-bedroom houseboat, gently cruising through the Kerala backwaters with a lovely crew of three.  They cooked wonderful, fresh meals and pointed out the amazing birdlife as we sat back and watched the world go by. We took a couple of bike rides along the way accompanied by one of the crew with bikes they had put on board for us. The houseboat has a spacious outside sitting/dining area, the bedroom had a/c and the good sized double bed was surrounded by a mosquito net.  The bathroom got a little hot without much air circulating. Two nights is worth doing as you see more and get fully immersed in the experience."
Oberoi MV Vrinda - 3 night cruise,"Having enjoyed several Oberoi hotel stays we incorporated a 3 night stay on the Mv Vrinda during our recent 4 week trip of South India. The boat is very comfortable and the accommodation as expected. The boat mores at it's own private jetty every night and each day's excursion starts from there. This inevitably means that there is a lot of repetition in the daily itineraries and we feel that 2 nights would have been sufficient - there was not enough variation to make the 3rd day interesting. Food is a la carte but apart from breakfast there is no menu. Chef will inform what he intends to cook for lunch and dinner and if you are not keen he will make an alternative. I probably expected a slightly more varied choice, but overall the food was good.With hindsight we feel it would have been better to stay in a nice 5* hotel on the Backwaters and done day trips in a small boat that are able to navigate the narrower canals."
Wonderful South India trip,"W‚ÄúGreat south India tour‚ÄùWritten on:¬†08/03/2019¬†by¬†Retiredfromsussex¬†(1 review written)Just back from a wonderful tour of South India. We enjoyed staying at a variety of different hotels, and loved the food in all of them. We particularly loved the heritage hotel we found ourselves in when the collapse of our airline meant a last minute change of plans. Please include this lovely place in future itineraries. We can't praise Citrus enough for the way they handled the crisis and the smooth way we were able to continue our tour.We had an excellent driver, Sree who was always on time, always found a parking place right where we needed access and was not only knowledgeable about everywhere but had a keen eye for spotting birds, wild boar, monkeys and on one memorable day - elephants! It really was a great tour."
Good but sad ,"The Back Waters were good. Our particular house boat was very spacious and luxurious.  The bird life and people going about their business on the banks was great to observe.   The Sad bit, hence the 4 stars, was the plastic bottles you will constantly see.  I would have thought a deposit scheme on plastic bottles,  returned clean Or dirty  would help clean this problem up."
Drifting along the Kerala Backwaters,We spent a night on a converted rice boat drifting along the Kerala Backwaters. It was the most wonderful relaxing experience. All of the food was excellent! Fabulous meals with a range of dishes from the region.Our en suite accommodation was very comfortable. Our boat had three staff caring for our needs.What a fantastic way to experience these tranquil waters.
Beautiful Alleppey Houseboats - Bad Experience,"We booked Two Bedroom Super Deluxe Houseboat LSR 02 through Beautiful Alleppey Houseboats.We felt cheated. The operator changed the route than what was promised, and covered a shorter route. The boat was running very slow, and it was very frustrating to see other houseboats overtaking our boat and covering longer distance during the same time. Finally the boat broke down on second day leaving us waiting in the middle of the water for more than two hours. They just cut short the trip and dropped us at the nearest point. The crew members on-board did not provide any information until asked leaving us guessing what was happening. The two starts given are for the cook for the nice meal."
Spice Coast Cruises - 1st Class Experience,"We weren't sure about doing a Backwater cruise but having seen these in documentary's etc we felt it had to be done. Our one bed cabin boat was a very basic converted rice boat but very comfortable. From the moment we boarded our three man crew just spoilt us rotten. We felt like Royalty. After an hour the chef prepared a sumptuous lunch. Simply the best food served to us in all our Indian travels. Snacks appeared later in the afternoon and as the sun started to set we moored on and island reserved for Spice Coast Cruises. Very peaceful with only two other boats nearby. With the sun down we had a quick shower while the crew placed mosquito nets around and set dinner. Another first class meal. So romantic eating by lamplight. After a good nights sleep breakfast was served before making our way back to the quay. Sorry crew, we made a note of your names but lost them. Boat no. 6 sailed on 27th Feb. (Photo attached). You all deserved a mention as you were so wonderful. Thank you. Simply our highlight of a three week tour."
Citrus Holidays,"A flawless holiday.We've had many many holidays but Citrus has provided an unforgettably superb experience. Our driver Reigan was exceptional, very courteous, an excellent driver and an expert guide,going well beyond our expectationns. When we next return to South India, we would request Travel Bug to provide Reigan as our driver. Thanks also to Travel Bug for providing such highly skilled and informative drivers as well as lovely clean and well equipped cars."
Spice Coast Cruises,"We've done a one night private cruise in a converted rice barge on Kerala's backwaters and it was an amazing experience. The boat was neat and clean. The staff - all three of them - were professional, attentive, friendly. Food was excellent and plentiful. Lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, breakfast - all with local dishes. It is amazing what the chef could create in that tiny kitchen. Fruit juices and water is included, if one would like to have beer or wine that can be bought on the way to the harbour. The scenery is beautiful and for those interested in birdlife binoculars and a Bird Book of India is provided. For overnight we stopped at a place reserved for Spice Coast Cruises and from where we could admire the sunset. There is no wifi, which makes this experience even more relaxing."
Spice Coast Cruises,"This experience was amazing! Two nights on a replica rice barge, travelling through the vast and intricate water ways of Alleppey. Our crew were extremely professional, attentive and intuitive, as well as, knowledgeable and a pleasure to travel to with. All carried out in relative luxury! We had a number of stops along the way, in order to stretch the legs. From a waterside market, to a 1500 year old temple! Our guide on these excursions was Vinu, who was a font of local knowledge, as well as our vessels main sailor!Yoshi was extremely resourceful and whilst expertly anticipating our thirst when returning from trips, with a variety of fruit juices and lassis, he was also quick to get into the water and clear out the propeller when water grass became entangled! Our chef, Lal was fabulous and his food was outstanding! The most exquisite flavours of Indian cuisine I encountered throughout my whole trip in Kerala! Delicious! Thank you to the three of them because they effectively take what is a stunning journey through breathtaking scenery and wildlife, and turn it into something extra special! If you‚Äôre in Kerala and not planning to experience the backwaters with Spice Coast Cruises, I implore you to reconsider!"
Kerala Backwaters,Kerala's backwaters are its most distinctive feature and Kerala backwater tours are a wonderful way to enjoy the scenic beauty of these unique landscapes.

Beautiful trip but boat rather shabby ,"I would highly recommend a night on a houseboat (one night is enough), the scenery is stunning.

Its awesome to kayaking through the backwaters,What i feel is after kayaking though the backwaters is its more worth than staying in the houseboats and travel for some hours in the river and big lake. You will enjoy more in kayaking. I loved the scenery and livelihood near by the backwaters.
Kerala backwaters,"Whilst staying in the area for four days we booked a three hour tour having wanting to see what the area has to offer and with a view to possibly booking and holiday on the water later this year.You get on the boat in the town and head out onto the waters. First you start to realise how many boats there are. All moored up along the banks. After an hour you then start to move into the small canals. It them become more interesting, see all the local people working, doing their washing etc. We then moved into a small canal this is what I was hoping for, to be able to see how real live was and be able to see the wildlife. Just as thing became interesting we had to start the return back to the main harbour area.  A lot to take in but well worth the time and the chance to see what‚Äôs on offer for the future. The bird life is Ok you see king fishers. Kite and other small birds, however to see the interesting ones you need to check the season and have a lot more time"
Beautiful memory,We went our honeymoon trip with gogeo holidays. They facilitated the best&we enjoyed a lot. Thank u gogeo
Don‚Äôt delay...you must visit,"The Kerala backwaters are relaxing, inviting, charming and calming. They are picturesque, with warm, friendly and welcoming people. If you cancelled or delayed plans to visit because of last year‚Äôs flooding, you need not worry.  We stuck to our plans and included Kerala as part of a fabulous Southern India trip.I recommend you re-plan, and set your sights on Kerala...without delay. The backwaters are enchanting and open for business."
Early evening canoe ride,We had travelled for a couple of hours and our house boat was moored up before getting in a couple of canoes to take us into the smaller waters. Interesting to travel at dusk as the waterways were quieter and no boats were expected. Great trip.
Truely Splendor,Alleppey is known as the Venice is of East and it lives up to that name. We had a Great experience enjoyed the Kerela houseboat drive it‚Äôs a beautiful place we loved the natural beauty greenery.Awesome trip
Boring and expensive ,"Just a slow rode in a unimpressive area where nothing happens and the guide doesn't contribute anything. Stopping only for spending money on ""authentic locations"" that are tourist traps."
Back water travel,Worth to stay in the boat. We 4 of the friends travelled from trichur to aalappi. From there we hired the boat Main attraction was good sea food. Perfect time to visit in between November to March.
Explore backwaters Gaaby homestay and overnight houseboat tour,"Explore adventure travel provided an excellent tour for my daughter and I in a tropical wonderland. The homestay was excellent, friendly people comfortable accommodation.The food although not my favorite was enjoyed by the others in our party. Drifting along seeing birds palm trees and temples was a peaceful tranquil day and evening"
Filthy,The place is dirty everywhere. No alchol drinking nearly everywhere as it's a dry state.nothing to do . Went to the golden temple your not allowed in .no photos. Would never come again and would advise everyone to go anywhere but here.the only good point is our hotel ...
Enjoyable,"Had a 55ft vessel just for the 3 of us. Over night, was hot on deck but the a/c is turned on in the cabins when you turn in for the night. Having breakfast whilst slowly cruising along was a highlight."
and relax,"how romantic. I felt like I was in a Bogart film. There was myself and my husband a 3 staff, Tomy, Rajesh and Vijimon who looked after us so very well. The food that was cooked for us was most definitely the best that we had eaten the whole of our holiday. The boat was gorgeous. we had a bedroom with an en suite, a lounge with a day bed in it also a dinning table. so relaxing. we were taken to a fish shop and bought the biggest prawns that I have ever seen, they were cooked for us over 2 days, Stunning. I was taken to a massage suite on the lake side. I have had massages all over the world but nothing like this one. I have never felt so relaxed and pampered in my life .Make sure you take some reading material with you. We will be back."
Backwaters,Hi we did the backwaters twice the first one was lovely so quiet all you heard was birds never seen as many kingfishers the food was good The second one was a bit longer but just as good after the traffic and noise it's lovely just to relax and enjoy all you see and hear if I could give more üåü star's I would
So beautiful,"Take a smaller boat, try'paddling' yourself! New tastes and sights and all guided by calm interested guides."
Backwaters in Kerala,Place is very beautiful. Houseboat double bedroom where u can Cook watch the Sunset & sunrise in the middle of the lake. our hotel Limon tree was good. Its a pity that staff was not friendly.
A Different Pace,"Our South Indian tour included a one night stay on a CGH Spice Boat Cruise which took us to explore some of the backwater channel before traveling across the lake in the morning to our next destination.  The facilities are pretty good for a boat and we were very well cared for by the crew of Madhu, Sanumon and our lovely chef David.  Two rattan chairs were placed either side on the prow and we sat here watching other houseboats and crowded day boats ferry up and down the lake.  There are 1500 boats like this on the lake all enjoying the palm fringed waters, populated with eyegrets, darters and dazzling kingfishers. Children swim in the waters whilst women wash clothes, occasionally stopping to smile and wave from the banks.  It was India‚Äôs 70th Republic Day when we visited and the bigger day boats were packed with partying and sightseeing Indians who motored past shouting and waving enthusiastically at us.   Lunch was excellent with fresh lake fish and wonderful not too spicy vegetable dishes; dinner was candlelit with delicious prawns, mildly spiced chicken curry, and deep fried crispy little cucumber chips.   We did feel obliged to go to bed early as it seemed like the last man standing wanted to get finished for the evening but we were happy to go and be rocked gently to sleep on the water.Breakfast was fresh fruits, fresh juice, eggs baked in curry, and freshly prepared options with plenty of fresh coffee.  The crew made us feel very welcome and the whole experience was a wonderful insight into quite a different way of life."
Memorable Trip,If you are planning to travel in Kerala then you must visit the backwaters of Kerala. It's so beautiful place and you will have lots of memories.
Spice Coast Cruises,"A tour of the beautiful backwaters of Kerala is a must!  We chose CGH Earth Spice Coast Cruises & we were so glad that we did.We only had 1 night on the boat but felt like that was enough.  After our hectic trip so far, it was absolutely magic to enjoy the peace & tranquility of the lake & the house boat!  It is such a peaceful way to travel & have a sticky beak at the goings on of life for people that live in this area.We were served a fabulous lunch, dinner & breakfast & the meals were plentiful & super delicious.  I loved this part of our trip!  Make sure you enjoy the Kerala Backwaters on a houseboat - you won't regret it!"
Wonderful Experience,"Stayed one night on the houseboat. Although accommodation was basic, it was one of the best experiences ever. The people who looked after us were fantastic. The food was out of this world. We had a wee sing song on the boat and kept the poor staff awake and they were still lovely to us. Highly recommend this amazing experience."
Spice Coast Cruises,"Reading some of the reviews about the backwater cruises, I had been concerned about what experience we would have for our two night trip. All of those concerns were unfounded and we had a wonderful time. We had an authentic well maintained boat for two, a much better option than some of the monster boats we saw. The crew were very friendly and took good care of us. The scenery along the routes we took were interesting and beautiful, lots of local life and wildlife to see. It reminded us of the beauty and peace you get sailing along the nature reserve on the Norfolk Broads. The food was fantastic, traditional Kerelan food. I'm not sure what companies many of the reviewers were using, but Spice Coast Cruises were excellent and all the reviews in the boat's book were glowing reviews. We could only find one review for this company which was written a few years back, more recent reviews are needed for this company. It is a very popular company to use because of the high standard of service, it's part of the C G Hearth group. So I don't understand why people aren't rewriting their glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. This was the last part of our two week itinerary through Southern India and I can say the cruise helped us finish on a high note."
.,"Excellent boathouse, very clean, amazing staff members, delicious fresh food, long sail through the backwaters"
Wonderful scenery dirty boat,"Are trip was with Karma Kerala, the boat was Mystica Rose. We booked a deluxe boat. The back waters are stunning and we loved that. The boat was awful. The bathroom smelt of sewage which filtered into the bedroom. We complained on many occasions, the staff just poured disinfectant on the floor. The back of the toilet was leaking every time you pulled the flush. We showered for three days in cold water. We were only allowed the air conditioning in our room after nine pm. None of this was acceptable.The general state of the boat was very poor and in need of refurbishment and the standard of cleaning was non existent We had three staff, two staff left the boat each night to go to their homes. We believe the route taken was to accommodate this. On our return I contacted the company but have recieved no reply.  Please check the boat before you leave the dock!"
1 Nights Stay,We enjoyed the 1 nights stay on the Star of Jesus houseboat. Captain Joseph and the Chef were great. We stopped at a market to get fresh prawns which was prepared for our supper. Shower was cold however it was hot so it was acceptable. Clean and neat houseboat. Cruising around was interesting and insightful. We had a 5am check out and the staff helped us get to the car on time and the packed breakfast was appreciated.
"Clean Rooms, Average Experience","The location of JCT shown in google maps is absolutely incorrect and you need to connect with hotelier for the proper guidance. The cruise started at 1 PM and stopped at 2 PM for lunch. The rooms at the ground level were more spacious than rooms at the top. It was clean and tidy nonetheless. The food was average, fish item provided in lunch was one per head fixed. During the cruise they will stop at a spot where they encourage you to buy overpriced pomfret and prawns from a particular lady and they offer to cook it for you during dinner. The boat takes a long circuitous path and anchors near a road bridge for the night. During the day, the boat starts at 8 AM and reaches the pick up point by 9 AM. There was no separate boat rides to the inner back waters as part of the hotel cost. The quality of food was also very average. The boat also completed its cruise one hour before the stipulated time. Overall the price we paid around 17K was not at all comparable with the service we received. They provided a single towel for two personsI am going for 2/5 stars for the overall experience i had at the houseboat."
Definitely not worth the money,"I had heard a lot about the Backwaters - the Venice of India etc. I think I prefer Venice !! Whilst the river network is interesting, it all looks the same so a few hours is fine. Would definitely not recommend wasting your money on an overnight houseboat. They are grossly overpriced and do not look like the photos on most websites. We booked through Blue Lotus and the boat was in desperate need of a re-fit. Couldn‚Äôt wait to get off after 2 nights."
"God‚Äôs own country, KERALA",If you are looking for some relax time in Kerala.go to allepey in back waters the view of coconut trees and the amazing view.its very relaxing.
"Beautiful, natural environment. Covered in litter and pollution.",The backwaters natural beautiful is amazing and trundling along was lovely as long as you didn‚Äôt look down. The beautiful waters are strewn with litter and the water polluted. What could be a purely magical place has like so many places in India been ruined by human pollution.
AN AMAZING TRIP TO BACKWATERS OF KERALA,"I Had gone to Kerala, a few weeks back. The trip was simply amazing. The best and the most memorable part of our tour was definitely the backwaters.

A very relaxing experience,We did a 2 night trip starting at noon on the first day and disembarking straight after breakfast. It was just the two of us with our excellent three man crew.

Faultless,"If you wish to do a houseboat trip in Kerala - then this is the way to do it - in style !The Vrinda experience lived up to its 5 star Oberoi expectations.  Gourmet chefs ensure your specific tastes are catered for, with no two meals the same. Alcohol is expensive, but then you are on holiday !  3 day cycle of cruises, shore trips and evening entertainment - all relaxing and enjoyable.  A highly recommended experience. Mozzie repellant supplied too for evening shore entertainment - essential for the likes of me, who mozzies consider a packed lunch.  All staff are a credit to Oberoi."
"Southern Panorama Cruise, Alleppey",Tks Kiran(Travel Door) for the awesome arrangement at Alleppey. Our one night (26 Dec) stay on Southern Panorama premium boathouse 'Kailash' was great fun. The sugarcane juice was a refreshing welcome. The captain was courteous & Shared a lot of info about the lakes. The chef was excellent & served us authentic food.The only drawback was we were repeatedly requested to vacate the common area/living room Space where the music was as the staff wanted to sleep at 9pm. This was totally unfair & on request we were allowed to use the space till 9.30pm but the chef insisted he had to sleep right there so we retired to our rooms reluctantly. This was a damper on our trip üòï especially since we had taken both the rooms & no other guests were on board.
Don‚Äôt book this with Rainbow Cruises!,"The backwaters are beautiful, but I would advise against booking a cruise with Rainbow Cruises. Our boat broke down on the second day. We spent a whole day waiting around, instead of cruising. That‚Äôs why we asked for a partial refund when we came back. The guys at the boat house told us to send an email to the office. The office had been ignoring us since then (16 days ago). They do not answer our emails. So we asked someone from our hotel to call Rainbow Cruises. The man he spoke to started swearing, was very unpleasant and told us to never call again. What a horrible company and terrible customer service. Beyond disappointed."
Boring boat ride in dirty waters,"We did a day village cruise organized by our hotel. We got picked up early on the morning in Alleppey and took the public ferry to some place further out in the backwaters. The group was about 25-30 ppl. At the remote place we have had a really bad breakfast which does not in any way resemble the great Indian cuisine you can expirience in Kerala. Then the boring part starts. The group gets split into smaller groups of 4-6 ppl who were distributed to smaller boats. Each boat has a Guides who does not really speak English. You just float for hours in the dirty water, thats it. The whole group was bored todeath and nobody seemed to like it. The water is disgusting and seeing the local families washing their clothes, dishes as well as themselves in the dirty waters makes you feel sad. I strongly recommend to stay away from the backwaters. Dirty, boring and not worth the money."
Review of our first time in the backwaters,"Fully of beauty and people working in there everyday lives, we did bird spotting which was amazing , and lots of locals doing there washing in the waters"
Public ferry from Kottayam to Alleypey,"From Thekkady we took a bus to Kottayam. From the bus stop we took a rickshaw towards the Kodimatha boat jetty and then hopped onto the public ferry towards Alleypey. The ferry took about 2.5 hours. At 1pm, the boat was not that crowded for most of the journey. It can get quite‚Ä¶"

Simply the best,The best way to see the backwaters is take a waterways run by Kerala Govt. Its cheap and best. Chat with local people. After an hour's journey get down to catch a bus and head back to alleppey bus stand.   Just go to the waterways jetty and ride this for as low as 10-15 rs for‚Ä¶

Five star plus experience,"We arrived at the small CGH  spice coast dock  in a forest location with traditiinal chinese fishing nets  on the waterside. WE were welcomed to our spacious, very clean boat ( no 2 ) for our overnight cruise which turned out to be one of the highlights of our 3 weeks in India..‚Ä¶"
Amazing Experience,"Stayed With Family and the host Shanthi Lal was super helpful,very friendly staffs,delicious food and the owner was kind enough to arrange us the birthday cake for my daughter and organised a cab for us to travel to kumarakom. Highly Recommended."

backwaters....,This adventure trail will take you cycling through the less traveled paths of Wayanad. You also get to explore the enchanting waterways of Wayanad in a bamboo raft. Be in sync with nature and explore your wild side with cycling and bamboo rafting in Wayanad.
Nice and memorable trip to Munnar,It was a very good weekend escape from hectic life. We feel highly refreshed now after having visited various places in Munnar. We really appreciate polite approach of one and all in Munnar and Kochi. Special thanks to Ms RAJITHA for guiding us and arranging our tour program and driver Mr. Sebin who was lively and cooperative throughout the journey.
"A day @ Southern Panorama Boathouse, Alleypey",Super clean boathouse. My family enjoyed staying at this boathouse. Suitable for bigger group as there have a big room upstairs that can accommodate 150 guests.
Very Good experience....,Very nice move...  Good hospitality and very good service..  Especially very delicious food... Reasonable price and also very comfortable...
Very relaxing and quiet,As we cruised on the backwaters of Kerala was very calm and scenice Coconut tree were everywhere. People were washing and bathing.  We visited a fishing village and purchased some fresh  king prawns and crab which the chef prepared for us.  Would have preferred to do a day trip‚Ä¶
Amazing experience with River and Country Tours,"The experience with River and Country Tours in Alleppey was spectacular. The houseboat was immaculate, clean and the staff always attentive, friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and especially not spicy (something very important to us). The boat ride was nice with a‚Ä¶"
backwater journey,backwater journey is a wonderful experience for me good food fresh air and a refreshment. Alappuza is a wonderful place for visit and enjoy the Beautiful moments.
Never go for the Travel Agent- Go Geo Holidays for any trip,"I can go on and on and will fall short of space here. I just came back from Kerala trip with two other female friends and thank God, we left the service of Go Geo Holidays mid way...It was a torture ..please be aware of the Driver called, Sukesh. I am not kidding.   I wont write‚Ä¶"
House boat trip,Enjoyed the nature in entire trip. Nice place and new experience. Food also very nice. Infrastructure too good. Must try this trip.
Must do!  This is the real Kerala.,You have not seen Kerala until you do this!  Houseboat cruise the backwaters.  Village life.  Natural beauty.  Peaceful.  Book an overnight cruise with a good company.  You will not regret it!
This is a must do for Kerala,"We stayed on a luxury houseboat in October. We had a cruise down the river and into the huge lake and watched everyone getting on with their everyday lives along each side. The boat was spotless with 2 large chairs, seating all around the sides and a dining table to the front.‚Ä¶"
Truly God's Own Marvel !,"God created and  then wondered who created it ! A very long network to explore. My favourite is fish all along the route, the cooked ones. Not that I know anything about fishes, except how to eat it !"
Enjoy the boat and its lake,"Was with the family in September 2016 and a great experience; the lake, it's surroundings and mainly the food. Here at the Boat House on the Lake you may just relax and enjoy the freshly cooked seafood....oops lake water breed. You may shop for lobsters, fishes crabs sold along the lake. Get the boatmen to cook for free. Do leave them a handsome reward or tips if the cooking is great. Belief me, it's always great. You may purchase coconut water or the local fermented brew or it's local beer the  ""Toddy"". The Back waters is ideal for all group of ages. My parents in their 80's suited well too. One may also hire a small boat to travel along the many villages and homes along the canal. It is indeed true that Kerala is ""GOD's OWN LAND"" and everything in it is paradise."
Boat trip,"KARMA KERALAWorst trip ever. Weekend before start, our boat was on ""accident"" and we were forced to change the boat. New boat was promoted with 15-20 yaers old photos. Here are some photos from this week. Karma Kerala, don't ever trust this company, promising luxury, delivering vety, vety poorly quality."
Mesmerising Visit in Godsowncountry,Visiting Kerala and not experience is backwater will leave you trip incomplete. This must to do when you visit this beautiful place with full of peace and extremely close to nature feeling. There are houseboats as well where you can also enjoy stay in these backwaters overnight.
NICE PLACE TO SEE,"It is one of the important place, one must visit when visiting Kerala, boating in the backwaters is really good feel."
Bad Quality Houseboat,Our Agent booked Exotica Personal Houseboat on 1st October 2018. Houseboat quality was bad. Interior and exterior was not good looking with damaged sofas
Fabulous converted rice barge,"This had to be the highlight of our holiday chugging along in a 4 berth converted rice barge this wonderful houseboat takes you through the backwaters of Kerala at a very relaxed pace all meals are included onboard as well as tea/coffee and snacks all prepared by a wonderful crew of three men. Very clean and well appointed rooms with en-suite facilities. Also went into the smaller backwater canals in a small local canoe, a journey not to be missed. The birds and the wildlife are not to be missed. Sad to have to leave after  only one night"

Lovely Kerala Backwaters,I have visited the Allepey backwater in the 1st week   of the August 2018.  The experience was amazing.
