Must see cave,Must see if you are Nashik area.There is little hiking but it's very beautiful caves from 1 BC. Beautiful caves.
Masterpiece caves from Nashik,Pandavleni caves are few Km away from Nashik. We visited in the morning and it was good choices to visit morning to skip crowd. Entry fee is ₹25 per person and you have to climb small mountain via steps to reach at the caves.There is series of 24 caves and few of them have beautiful idols. Definitely must visit place
Perfect place that gives a picturesque view,The best part about this place is that you get to view this unique piece of architecture from the history. You have one of the most mesmerising views from the top. There’s a lot to walk... this approximately takes about 25 - 30 minutes but that hard work of walking gives a very amazing view along with something beyond your imagination- that would definitely give you a feeling of utter amazement and happiness.  Best place to get information about ancient historical knowledge.
Worth visiting during monsoon or winter,"Though it was winter end but still we were sweating while going up to the caves.Built after Buddha era, these caves possess valuable information for travellers and history enthusiasts."

Decent place with lots of greenery,This is decent place with having lots of greenery and trees. Very near to city area so reached by walk there. Good place with historical values.
Heritage,Pandavleni Caves is a beautiful place to visit when in Nashik. It's astonishing how beautifully carved and constructed these caves are. Worth a visit!

Must visit places in Nashik,"The caves are beautiful, Nashik city view from the top is really nice especially in monsoon, caves are well maintained, ticket fee is nominal, video recording camera needs another ticket, for photo no fee is there, hike is almost about 20 to 30 to 40 mins at the max depending on your pace. Ample parking is available here."
Good place for one time visit,"Great place to look over nasik with a birds eye view. The cave are ok, not much to see there. Since I had a young kid it was tiring to climb all those stairs, but good for a first visit."
"1st Century BCE Caves, Awesome Place..!!","Pandavleni Caves are a group of 24 caves carved between the 1st century BCE and the 3nd century CE, though additional sculptures were added up to about the 6th century, reflecting changes in Buddhist devotional practices mainly.These caves are one of the oldest caves of Maharashtra. Some of the caves are large and contain numerous chambers - these rock-cut caves served as a viharas or monasteries for the disciples to meet and hear sermons. They contain interesting sculptures. One of the vihara caves is older and finer in sculptural detail and is thought to be nearly as old as the Karla Cave near Lonavala. Another cave (cave No. 18) is a chaitya and is similar in age to that at the Karla Caves and has a particularly elaborate facade."
A Small trek with amazing Caves!,Its a good place where you can enjoy a small hike to the mountain and also see the ancient caves which are said to be carved by the Pandavas many years ago.The view from the top is also great! Consider this place as a short picnic cum hike!
Beautiful and Humbling,These caves are the 2000-year-old Pandavleni Caves which are ancient rock-cut caves representing Hinayana Buddhism.I visited these caves on a cool misty day which minimized the number of people that were there. There is a moderate walk up a winding sidewalk path to the top where these caves are. You have to take your time to look at all the intricate detail that must have taken long and difficult work to carve into the rock. Some caves you can actually walk into which make it an even more amazing accomplishment.
Ancient treasure.. ,Pandavleni.. A beautiful cave wonder hiding amazing Buddha  stone sculpted in cave walls.. Leaves us wondering how did they manage such creativity in those days when there weren't any means. Just 200 steps up and you confront the amazing caves. You can view Nashik from top.. And green all around.. Its heavenly if you visit during rains..! Nashik harbours many magical spots into its heart..!
Historical place,Among one of the oldest historical places in Nashik is pandavleni caves. These caves were built by Pandavas to hide. After that many kings visited this caves faught for this caves and modified it. After that these caves were given to buddhist monks . They started their living here . Everything you can see here . The walls of the caves are full of Gautam Buddha's sculptures.
In The Era of Budhha,This caves are very old and massive there are likely to be 13 to 14 cave some are such big and good enough.very nominal fee is required to see this cave in this there are so many Buddhist statues
Just amazing,"It’s unbelievable how the caves had been curved a long time ago with no modern machine tools and facilties and that too at mountain. It’s amazing. A worth seeing place if you are in Nashik. Just wondering why, it is not so popular. One needs to climb a bit about 15 minutes or so. There are 24 caves of different sizes. I am running short of words to describe the beauty of these sculptures. If possible, spare some time there to feel the ambience. Normally, we don’t do but should do so.  We went there in June 2019. Fortunately, it was not a sunny day. During monsoon and just after monsoon the city view will be awesome, I guess. Must carry water bottle. At the bottom of hill, you will find Budha Vihar. Just sit there and feel the difference."
History ,The design and architecture of the caves is simply outstanding. Noone can believe it is our history it has been made very unique. Great our gods were really great
Historic caves atop hill,"Lovely caves of same as Ellora, very hard and fine work done at such height with water storage and self sufficiency for living so many people with over 24 caves and so many statues and big halls built over 1000 years ago.... fantastic"
Well preserved Buddhist caves,"After a short climb, it's a well preserved caves dating back to 1st century BC. There are 24 caves of different sizes and made over time. I guess it would be a great view of surrounding after monsoon, but right now was very dry and barren.We enjoyed the walk but was really very hot and water is a must to carry."
Magnificent Caves,It is around 10 kms from Nashik. Entry ticket is 50 Rs.The Pandavleni Caves can be reached by a flight of steps from the bottom of the hill and one needs to do 20 minutes trek to reach the caves. Some of the caves here are intricately connected by stone-cut ladders that join them to the other caves. Pandavleni Caves are a group of 24 caves. Once you return there is a Budha Vihar.
Majestic Structures!,The steep climb to reach the caves is worth the majestic structures carved out of the hill sides. Definitely worth visiting.
Mindblowing Story in Stone—told since 2 Millenia,"2000 year old complex of 24 caves excavated into the north face of a rocky hill. Took in the sheer scale of viharas carved 40+ feet into the rock, further expanded into cells, then decorated to freeze 3D images into timelessness. Pillars, doorways, lintels are used to etch text messages proclaiming who made what and when, to enable precise dating of the complex as also providing a glimpse into the lives of that time and this place.Back to the present. There's ample parking at the base of the hill. It's a 15min brisk walk up the hill along an excellent paved path. Archaeological Society of India has display boards giving interesting details of what you'll get to see. Ticket counter opens at about 9am. Before that the hill and caves are a regular morning walk for many locals, but access to the cave interiors is barred, and that is a must see. I was there at about 9 and had the caves to myself. Cave interiors are cool and well maintained, not a hint of bat. Cave entrances are oriented to get enough light for some useful photographs. Footwear has to be removed at the cave entrances. Exteriors are hot, hot, hot with only headgear to stave off the sun. There are basic refreshments at the parking area, but nothing at the caves, not even water. It took me about 2 hours from start to finish at the parking, and I got what I felt was a essential feel of the complex. Awed by the privilege of clambering over, around and into architecture that has survived 20 centuries."
Hidden gem of Nashik,Just 15-20 minutes drive out of central Nashik and this wonderful place is situated. It's a small trek up the hill but it's worth its salt. Wonderful caves and mind-blowing carvings on the walls. Wonder why this gem has not been made famous. It's as wonderful as Ajanta illora caves. The bird eye view of whole Nashik is just fabulous. Must visit for every tourist.
Ancient caves,"Wonderful bunch of caves created for Budhist monks. Involves a climb of moderate difficulty. We went in the peak of summer, in the afternoon and so was tougher. But youngsters and middle-aged people should be able to handle it. Caves are kept clean."
"Wow, it is impressive","After Sula vineyards, i think it is the next thing to add to your todo list when you are in Nashik.Different caves in the mountain, they are very old. It is not expensive to visit. Don't forget, it's caves, not underground, but on the mountain. So expect to climb a lot of steps.Like every temple, you are asked to remove your shoes when you enter a cave.There is also a temple at the bottom of the mountain with a big Buddha in it."
Awesome! ,They're Buddhist caves conveniently termed as Pandavleni caves! Why god knows. They were cut well after the Pandavas. Must visit. A parikrama is about an hour long. Could do for the energetic. 20mins climb from the car park by steps.
Very much worthy for visit.,You have to walk up to some steps before arriving near the caves which are really admirable and well maintained by ASI.
Historic caves ,Want to climb around 200 steps..nashik city view can be seen from the steps..but must visit place ..24 caves are there to visit..better senior citizens avoid to climb the steps to visit this place
Indian History and Architecture at best,"You have to trek uphill to reach the site of caves, they are 24 in total with various stories attached to them. Entry is by ticket and place gives a panoramic view of the Nasik city. The trek comprises of steps and some without steps so choose to wear good shoes as trek is stoney and walk carefully as its very steep climb."
History splittered,India is amazing and a monument 2 BC old right in the hills of Nashik city. Mind it the timings are strict and start climbing before 5 in evening. Not many stairs for youngsters but may be a small mother for elderly.... Buddhist architecture will leave u amazed in the same scale as Ajanta caves..... pl do visit.... keep it clean
Weekend trip,Nice place to go and spend with family. Especially kids. Only thing is you need to do a little trecking. If you are going alone best time is to go in the morning. It will be a good exercise. If you are going with family go around 3pm and by 5pm they close. Lot of caves with adequate provision for water during old days is something fascinating. Carry enough water with you since at present there is no provision for water up there which is again a tragedy. There is a lot of provision to do trecking and once you reach the top of the mountain you have a magnificent view of the city.
nice historical place,Had visited in last month during my maharastra visit. the really very nice historical place. lost of visitor comes here.
Great climb and views ,"Situated near the highway, it’s a nice landmark to visit considering it has some interesting and mysterious caves uphill. Steps aren’t too much and can be done easily in 15 mins. Total around 20 caves small ones. Caves are good but other than 2 of them others won’t leave you with awe. But the place is clean and well maintained.Great city views from the top"
It is a place where you should visit,It is situated on a pandava caves. It is a place where you need to climb for approximately 20 minutes at the you will reach padav caves.
Memories Refreshed after 40 Years,"I used to visit this place while I was posted at Deolali during 1978-81. I remember we used to be 20-22 year old young Defence Officers and there was always a competition to run and climb up the place. It was a different story after 40 years but yes still managed to climb up. I was happy to see that Caves were still well maintained and the place was neat and clean. These caves are said to be more than 2000 years old - in fact they could even be 2500 years old i.e. 500 BC. Several Jain Munis have stayed here for many many years as per the documented history. Out of the 24 Caves, Cave No. 3 and 10 are a must visit."
good for hearty walk steps!!,"not recommended for old ppl, but awesome for treking ppl.. steep climb which helps adrenaline rush for few min. ..few caves same like others..view of nashik city is good from there"
Beauty of Nashik City.,"Pandavleni this is historical place,24 caves available here.See beautiful nashik city view in top.So don't miss when you in nashik."
Beautiful,It's a beautiful archeological site. The carvings are minimalistic and lack fine details. But you will definitely feel calm and peaceful as you go on exploring each cave.Though it is quite maintained what bothered us was the garbage thrown around the premises. I feel we Indians should recognise how culturally rich we are and how important it is to maintain our cultural heritage.
Fascinating caves above Nashik,A short visit to the caves and nearby temple. Interesting experience  of awe inspiring rock work and a good climb!
What an amazing place,It is amazing to me how they carved these caves so many years ago with limited tools.  The attention to detail is amazing and a must see while in Nashik.You have to climb some stairs so bring some water with you.
Wonderful place!,"In Pandavleni, 8 km south of the city, there are 24 Buddhist caves of the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. The oldest of them is the cave number 10 with a vihara (monastery), decorated with magnificent sculptures and inscriptions above the entrance. Cave No. 18 (early chaytiagriha) is provided with beautiful carvings outside. Beautiful caves number 3 and 20.      From the parking lot you will need to climb about 500 meters along the stone steps. At the entrance to the box office. For foreigners, the ticket costs 300 rupees, for local residents 25 rupees. It is better to visit these caves in the morning, until the sun bakes much."
Famous Tourist Place,"I went to Pandavleni Caves. The Pandavleni Caves were built by prominent rulers of that time, such as the Satavahanas and Kshaharatas, for the Hinayana Buddhist monks. It is great place to go."
Charming and a peek into indian history,"Beautiful place, worth the climb, lovely old buddha statues at top - do visit.. several caves spread over a modest area and a lovely panoramic view.."
One of the oldest rock-cut Buddhist cave temples of Maharashtra,"Located about 8 km south of the centre of Nashik, these caves were built gradually over an extended period of time starting from the 1st century BCE under the Jain kings, and continuing till the 3rd century CE under local Buddhist royalty and merchants. Starting from the 4th century, there were additions of Buddhist sculptures of Buddha and Bodhisattva, and active shaping of the caves might have continued up to the 12th century.A steep climb of about 200 stone steps lead to the caves from the bottom of the hill, but the view from the top is absolutely worth it, and the caves are also worth a visit. In Marathi, ""Pandav Leni"" means ""Pandava Caves"", since locals believe that the legendary Pandavas made these caves while hiding away in exile, but this might not be true. The actual name might have been ""Pandu Leni"", where ""Pandu"" or ""yellow colour"" refers to either the colour of the rocks or the colour of the robes worn by Buddhist monks who lived in these caves. However, the ancient name of these caves is Trirashmi Caves or Trirashmi Leni, Trirashmi being the name of the hills in which the caves are located. ""Trirashmi"" means ""three rays of sunlight"" which is an obvious reference to the first rays of sunlight emerging from behind the caves, as seen from the village below the hills. The Caves have beautiful pillared entrances, and some contain exquisite sculptures of Buddha and Bodhisattva. Most of the caves are viharas (monasteries), but three are chaityas (shrines). These caves also contain valuable ancient inscriptions on their walls in Brahmi script."
Must visit when going or vising Nashik,"Must visit when in Nashik. Ancient caves...uphill walk for about 15 to 20 minutes....be careful when with children and elderly people...entry fees..but once reach the place, get yourself lost in ancient lives of pandavas...some beautiful sculptures of lord Buddha....also a nice top view of the city...Nashik Panasonic view...nice garden at the base of caves .."
Good trekking spot with awesome view of nashik,"You can trek to the peak point in around 45 mins, wear a good grip show as it will help in trekking. you can go till mid point with steps. But if you want to reach at the top you have to bit of trekking. good to go !!!"

Nice place,"It gives you a bird's eye view of entire city..Feels like the roof top of city. The climb is worth the scene and the caves are marvellous and fascinating.If you are there around sunset time, head towards the right portion of caves and see the amazing view in golden  light.."
A must visit place in Nasik,"We went there early morning, which was wise as it gets warm after the sun is up. But the walk up is worth it; the caves are deep and cool, easy to visualize the monks living there. The bits of information on the small hoardings en route are a very good read and give one a break while climbing the steps."
Rock cut beauty,"Pandavleni cave may not be as mighty as the Ajanta or the Ellora caves, but still has a graceful touch to it and looks beautiful indeed. You need to climb 100 steps to make it to the caves. And from the top, you get a great view of Nashik city."
Good landscape but monsoon wont allow you to go through the caves,"nice place,riverrocksscenic view.dont miss itif u r in nashikeasily accessible through roadwalkable for kids and elders..."
at the entryof  nashik city.,this is abuddist caves at the entry point of nashik city coming from mumbai.a good short treak.local peoples are doing regular treak at this hillok.
Surprise from the top.,Its a run down ancient caves. Steep hike with poor facilities including no washrooms. Not safe and recommended for people with knee problems. The caves can be seen although there are no light facilities. So geeks should carry their own torch.Best part is the view of nashik city and the expressway below. Worth a visit or as a fitness test but dont have high hopes.
Ancient Buddhist Caves With Beautiful Stone Carvings.,"The Pandavleni Caves are located besides the Mumbai – Nashik Freeway and it is in the Buddha Vihar Complex on the right side of the Freeway, 3 km before reaching Pathardi Phata, and 8 km before Nashik. The Dada Saheb Phalke Smarak and the Trirashmi Buddha Smarak are also located in this compound. There is sufficient free parking space nearby. We had a stiff climb of about 200 hundred steps, and had to pay an entry fee of Rs.15 per person. The historic archaeological site is managed by the ASI. There are 24 caves cut into the hillside, with carvings of various Buddhist monks, although the carvings of the Buddha himself were later additions by the devotees of the Mahayana faith between 4th to 6th centuries CE. The original cave excavations date back to between the 1st to 4th century CE. The interior of the caves have simple carvings whereas the exteriors are more elaborately and intricately carved. Cave numbers 3, 8, 10, and 23 are bigger, more well planned and better than the rest of them.The beauty of these caves lies in their dignified façade. These caves are not at all connected to the five Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata, as the name may imply.Visiting hours are from 8 am to 5.30 pm. It is a good place to visit for history and archaeology buffs. Situated about 300 feet above the ground level we got an excellent bird’s eye view of the entire city of Nashik. It will look even better in the months of July and August after some more rains helping to cover the land with a carpet of emerald green."
historical place,"a must visit place if one is travelling to nasik, it is adjacent to phalke smarak.only concern is smell of toilet in few caves whichis because of few over enthusiastic tourist who want to leave their mark of visit there."
Nice trekking experience,We went to this place in the month of July/Aug and everywhere it is green and wet due to rains.We reached this place little early at around 8 am as we would like to spend some peaceful time without much crowd.we enjoyed climbing the steps and we could see a peacock also on the way to caves.All these caves seems to be very old and all of them are either buddist/jain caves.Scenary of this place is very nice and the place is very peaceful.There is one buddha stupa near to this caves and it seems to be a dhyna mandir
"About Pandavleni Caves
 Time Required: 2-3 hrs

 Cost: Adults: INR 2,
Children (Up to 15 years): Free,
The entry is free","Located about 8 kilometres to the south of the centre of Nashik in Maharashtra in India, the Pandavleni Caves are ancient rock-cut caves that are situated on the tableland of the Trivashmi Hills. These caves have existed for more than 2000 years now and date back to the period between the 3rd century BC and 2nd century AD. Interestingly, these caves hold their importance and value till date. The Pandavleni caves are a group of 24 caves that represent the Hinayana Buddhism. The mystic caves also comprise of musical fountains, museums and various outlets of food. Multiple monasteries, shrines, water tanks, pillars, and carvings can also be found inside.The Pandavleni Caves were built by prominent rulers of that time, such as the Satavahanas and Kshaharatas, for the Hinayana Buddhist monks. They are also commonly known as the Pandu Caves, Pandavleni Caves, and Nasik Caves, and have served as home to many prominent and renowned Jain saints, including Ambika Devi, Tirthankara Vrishabdeo, and Veer Manibhadraji. Of all the twenty-four caves, cave numbers 3 and 10 are the most beautiful ones. The architecture of these caves is unique and impressive. The inside of these caves also consists of inscriptions which act as a significant study material for researchers and scholars till this day. Cave number 15 has an inscription about the King of Western Maharashtra. There are beautiful sculptures, chambers, unique water structures and stone ladders too built inside the cave. The Dada Saheb Phalke Smarak lies at the foot of the Pandavleni caves and showcases the work of Dadasaheb Phalke. Tourists have to climb nearly 200 steps to reach the top and enjoy the breathtaking views. People also visit this attraction frequently to enjoy trekking. At the same time, the location of the caves is a prominent holy Buddhist site. This makes the Pandavleni Caves a well-known tourist site that is visited by tourists in large numbers all year round.The Pandavleni Caves can be traced back to the 1st century BCE. They were initially known as Pundru, which means 'yellow ochre colour' in Pali language. This is because the caves served as the residence of Buddhist monks who wore the 'chivara' or yellow robes. These alluring caves were used to provide space for carrying out meditation and for living suitably and peacefully. The name of the caves - Pandavleni- has no reference and no connection to the Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. Some water tanks, which are built inside the rocks, served as places where meetings were held amongst the disciples. They also comprise of numerous sculptures of Bodhisattvas and Lord Buddha.Later on, the word 'Pundru' was changed to Pandu Caves. The various inscriptions in the beguiling cave are an essential source of relevant historical information. They bear testimony to the fact that Nashik in that period was ruled by three dynasties in all - the Western Kshatrapas, the Satavahanas and the Abhiras. The inscriptions also confirm that apart from the kings, local merchants and landlords also supported Buddhism and donated large amounts of money for the development of the Pandavleni Caves. Decades later, people started calling these caves as the Pandav Caves, and they continue to be recognised by this name till date, even though the name is a misnomer.Layout and Concept of Pandavleni CavesThe group of these twenty-four caves was cut in a long line on the north face of the Trisasmi hill. Other than holding significant historical value, the caves also represent a brilliant phase in the rock-cut architecture style that existed in those times. Although there are twenty-four excavations in all, many of them are small and less significant. The interior of the Pandavleni Caves comes across as simple when compared to the heavily ornamented exterior.Interior of Pandavleni CavesMost of the Pandavleni Caves are Viharas, which means that they are dwellings or refuges used by wandering monks during the rainy season, while the 18th cave is a Chaitya, which is basically a shrine or a prayer hall with a Stupa at one end. The most fascinating and significant caves are cave numbers 3, 10, 18 and 20. While cave 3 is a massive vihara with 16 cells and amazing sculptures, cave 10 is even grander and more beautiful. It contains inscriptions about donations that were made by Ushadatta sometime around 120 AD. Cave 18 is a 'chaitya' with a particularly elaborate facade and is the oldest cave in the entire group. It contains beautiful, intricate carvings and a stupa.These aesthetic caves are home to shrines, cisterns, rare inscriptions, carved figures of Buddha and icons of some of the Jain Teerthankaras. One can also find sculptures that represent the kings, farmers and merchants while the rich iconography depicts a beautiful amalgamation of the Indo- Greek style of architecture. The site also boasts of an excellent and ancient water management system. Several water tanks are also located here and were skilfully chiselled out of solid rock. Best time to visit Pandavleni CavesThe best time to visit the Pandavleni Caves is during the months extending from July until February. This is because the scenic beauty gets enhanced during this time and the place looks even more attractive and enchanting.How to Reach Pandavleni CavesThe place is commonly visited from the Nashik CBS Bus Station. A journey to the Pandavleni Caves from here takes about 3 hours. From Nashik, there are auto rickshaws and buses available, which will drop you to the Pandavleni Caves. The caves on the hilltop can then be reached by trekking for about 20 minutes on a path that is well built with steps."
Nice short Trek and a good peak into the Glorious Past of India,"Important: Have a good pair of shoes as the path is strewn with pebble and may hurt if the sole of the shoe is too thin.It is a short 30-45 minutes climb and should be navigable by the elderly as well (unless they have some problem). This has nothing to do with Pandavas by the way, just so that you know. The Ambedkar smarak and Dada Saheb Phalke museum are also located nearby so you can plan accordingly."

Historical delight,its about 200 steps to the top and of historical significance as they assume the pandavas used to stay here during vanvas. many caves to explore but its a steep climb up the stairs. they have a food corner below where I would recommend you stock up for water and snacks before you climb. decently maintained
Very old caves,Perfect place for history lover. Very old caves and well maintained place. Many tourists came here for visit. Build in old time.
Step Up Your Way,"An unassuming entry leading to a long and tricky climb up the steps of the hill and voila....you will reach the Pandavleni Caves, 13 of them, with carvings, and stone work. The climb can be even trickier during monsoon. Pretty much kept clean and maintained, as one would expect if 15rs per person (of indian origin, free for children) is charged an entree fee. From the top one can also see the extents of Nashik city and also get a good view of the highway leading to Mumbai."
Historic Buddhist caves,This place has around 25 caves in all. You will have to climb around 200 steps over the mountain to reach this place. This place should be pleasant during monsoons. If you have you kids they would be super exited looking at the structures like mine were. A good place to see some ancient structures and spend with family and friends.They charge you an entry fee of Rupees 15/- for residents and 200/- for foreigners .
A heritage place in Nashik,It is said that those caves have been carved during the Pandava's regime. There are some Budhha statues also. Due to this mix of two culture the place has been always under controversy. But leaving apart this issue the place is very beautiful at a very reasonable heights on the mountain opposite Garware point in Nashik on Mumbai-Agra Road. Many local people go for morning walk at this place. This is a place of pride for Indian culture and worth visiting.
Could be missed,"The hike to the caves is too tasking and the caves is not worth the effort. Part of the problem is that the condition it is in, doesnt leave you with an awe!"
Must visit this heritage monument,Was extremely satisfied as took time out to visit this historical and important monument in Nashik.Spent more than an hour exploring the set of 24 caves. Few caves were locked and we're thrown open post 9:00 am.Maintenance needs a review.Morning view of Nashik city was splendor.
Humans straddled great heights even then!!!,"I've been to many cave structures and this is yet another, but what sets it apart is that it is extremely well preserved and in a unique setting. A flight of stairs leads up the mountain wall to the caves that have been carved out of solid rock surfaces somewhere midway to the top. the structure has everything that a large set of monks in those times would have needed to stay and go about their daily riturals. Wells dug into the rock, that supply fresh water, living quarters, prayer rooms, statues of Buddha in various forms and sizes. All this was achieved thru sheer hard labour and with little or no tools. The best part being that the architecture and design has withstood the test of times, with almost 2000 years going by and virtually no damage to the structures.It is a must visit to admire, thank and feel proud of those noble men and women who built this marvel and left it for all mankind that followed."
Pandvieni Caves,the Pandavleni Caves are ancient rock-cut caves that are situated on the tableland of the Trivashmi Hills. Historical and famous. Must see place in Nasik.
A trip in history,"My 6-yr old daughter thoroughly enjoyed going in, enjoying the echo in caves and raising up and down the caves. Its a piece of our history and worth kids to experience."
Feels good everytime,"Visited the caves after so many years. The trek up feels do good and the streams at the site are so cold. The marvellous architecture makes you wonder about the capacity of those people. We found some baby crabs, and oh there were so pinchy. Don't handle them though."
One of the well maintained Buddhist Caves in Nashik not to miss,"We visited the Caves when we traveled to Nashik recently. We started at about 10.00AM and visited all 24 caves and finished our sight seeing at about 12.30PM. The weather was little hot and humid during the time of our visit. The tree lines on your way are totally dried and you have to climb about 200 steps or so to reach the top. The tickets are available at the top only (near entrance). They charge 15 for Indians and 200 for foreigners. There are few caves which are very good and not to be missed. No. 3, 10, 23 are best ones. I do not know why they have stated 8th cave as one of the best. We could not see anything inside. There are carvings in Pali language in some of the caves. Buddha in various poses are chiseled on the walls and pillars. There is a large prayer Hall where the chanting creates vibration and we chanted ""Buddha'm Saranam Gachhami"" and it had a good impact. The Chaita (Stupa) is also not to be missed. Some climbing is required to reach few caves. But it was worth it. You can have a good view of the Nashik city from the top."
Heritage Caves,Ensure you reach here early morning. This offers you not only heritage caves but a beautiful view of Nashik city. You need to climb more than 200 stairs to reach at the top. There is an entry charge for you. Worth a visit so don’t stop in middle. It’s very charming at the top.
Rich in History but poorly maintained,Is it must go..well I doubt. But history is high. As usual the upkeep of monuments is not that wow. You have to walk up the slope and there is entry fees to enter the caves.
Brilliant architecture,From the base site the top of the caves is an easy 15-20 minute walk. Entry passes for Indians is about 15rs. The architecture of the cave is brilliant and it's well maintained.
Visit to Pandavleni caves,"If you have already visited Ajanta and Alora caves near Aurangabad then not much interesting to visit. I visited during my trip to Nasik and visited . if you are visiting first time to Caves then these are beautiful to see history . there is up hill for 45 min so plan if you can go up with stairs along with kids, Normally kids are ok to go up but very small you have to carry then it will be very challenging.View from top is nice  ...  Parking is very poor and less . overall ok place to visit"
Good,A pretty decent place for someone who enjoys historical placesThis one is surely a hidden gem.i would recommend a guided tour.definitely recommendba visit to this place
Must Visit if You're in Nasikh,Place is tidy and the kind of history it beholds is amazing. It's a bit of a climbing but is worth it. Carry a water bottle along. And must try the street bhel which was really delicious at the hawkers near the entrance.
The place was awesome and awkword,The place was awesome and awkword too you get a very good view of the city from the top and the funny part is that they charge ₹ 10 per indian and ₹200/400 per foreigner I was amazed to see such thing and this is a historic place you get to know about history and how thing used to work at that time how people used to live in there and the kings also
Fantastic place ,It is one of the best place to visit in Nashik . The caves are well maintained. Also the climate there is awesome . A place for adventure also .
Beautiful heritage site ,"Very close to Nashik highway, the Pandavleni caves was a brilliant discover, thanks to Google. It took more than half an hour to climb up to the caves. Carry water and wear keds. The caves have beautiful idols of Buddha and other deitys. The view of Nashik from above was breathtaking."
Adventures ,"If you have Adventurous person then u should visit pandavleni. Get plenty of water with you, as you will be needed while climbing the steps of the mountain. It's not so difficult but climate makes it more difficult."
Beautiful but less attentive,Beautiful caves of historical importance. A must visit by a person who is interested in historical sites.But it is really pathetic to realize and see that a site of such glorious history is not properly attended by the administration. This is the main problem with us that probably due to abundance of heritage sites we don't care about our heritage sites and culture. When we are proud of India then we must proud of everything especially our culture and heritage.
Awesome!,"This place is really remarkable! History is still preserved there and the caves are in good shape. Actually, Nasik is one of my favorite places, I spent 1 year of my childhood there. So, love this place."
Uphill Into History,"200++ steps to walk uphill. The caves are fairly well kept, but nothing much to see except a stunning view of Nashik city from the top of the hill. Lots of history, but lost in time. Rs 15 to enter if you are an Indian citizen and Rs 200 if you are a foreigner. The lack of hygiene was obvious - no toilets."
Great place to know about chaityasq and Viharas.,This place is on Mumbai Agra Highway. It is about 9 km from Nasik. A small hillock where we need to climb 250 steps to reach the monument. Beautiful chambers with a place for meditation. Altogether there are 24 chambers or caves. Rs 15 is the entrance fee. No directions or info from the person who collects money. On the top we can see whole Nasik city. This cluster of caves is also called Trirashmi. Cave no 3 is too good and it is called Gautamiputra Vihara. Beautiful pillars and central stupas are worth appreciating. Better to carry water bottle as nothing is sold on the top. Parking is available on the foot hills. Even cabs are available from Nasik city. Ancient water storage is now a place for throwing empty bottles.Place so nice that it can be  very good picnic spot but it is not maintained well.
Great place,An epic and historic place with mahabharata-era pandav caves. Also a great picnic spot with wall climbing and stairs. Green gym at the peak. One gets a scenic view of nashik from the top.
Historical Site with a 360 degrees view of Nasik,"A hill feature astride the Mumbai Agra Highway. The site can be seen as you approach Nasik from Mumbai. It is inconspicuous, but a splendid beauty as you visit it. There are caves with great piece of sculptures within these caves. Historical significance is that the Pandavas stayed within these caves. There is a need for restoration and management of the site. I recommend that you wear sneakers or rubber sole shoes if you plan to visit this great place."
Requires lot of effort and a lot of walking.,You need to climb much to reach the destination. And the destination is just caves with some chambers. Many of them don't even have idols in them. Doesn't even have a canteen there so if you're hungry you'll need to borrow food or go down. Though water is available but that too is at the top. When you purchase the ticket and get in.
No proper description about individual caves!,"Its a 15 minutes trek to beautiful caves with panaromic city view. On the way there are some display board which explains about each caves. But one tends to forget about the description, after reaching to the top as there are 20 individual caves. So the best way is to take photograph of all the display boards and when you reach up, you can refer your photographs and understand different sculptures and script inside the cave."
A history lesson,Do not miss the architectural Marvel & the splendid historical value these cave possess.A tiring climb up 250+ steps is well worth the effort.
A HOLY cave,You have to stand on line and then slowly crawl down carefully to reach the final spot and definitely you will get peace in mind.
Must visit!,"An easy hike to a must see. As a visitor on vacation from the UK, I highly recommend visiting. Great value for money, and a wonderful glimpse in to the history of the area."
Ancient Caves frequented b Pandavas,"Amazing caves located on mountain about 270 steps to go up.You can see almost entire Nashik from the Top of the Caves.Anyway, almost dated 2000 yrs ago this place is amazing.Irony is you won't get any public conveniences including water."
Caves ,Nice place to visit in Nasik. Those who love trekking should visit this place and go above the caves. View from caves is amazing can see whole of Nasik.
Most Loving Spot For Kids & Mind Pleasing Spot For Family Outing in Nasik,"Cave Timings 9 am to 5 pm.Following 3 spots at this place makes Pandvaleni the spot most loved by kids & families on weekends & public holidays;1.

Nashik Cave,Must visit place at Nashik. Only hill climbing experts are encouraged to go for hill top visit. Will enjoy and good picnic place as well.
"Beautiful Heritage preserved, must visit",Experience a short good hike up the steps for about 10-15 mins (lesser if you are in a good shape) to experience one of the well preserved string of the Pandavleni Caves.There is somewhat of a parking area at the foot of the climb. The climb itself is well shadowed by trees & safe to reach the entrance. Do not miss the informative boards along the climb which explains the history & significance of the caves. Follow the numbers mentioned so you will enjoy the discovery of the cave numbers once you reach.Very Good concept.With a minimal entry fee of Rs. 15/- enjoy the view our rich heritage has to offer. Also enjoy the breathtaking view of Nashik city from the top.Please remember to respect & keep the premises clean.
beautiful caves- very peaceful,nice place - two fold attraction- for it is supposed to be where Pandavas stayed as well as later on developed for buddhist monks to meditate worth a visit for historical y and archaeological inteerst
Cool day with Pandavleni cave,"One of the best place with family,entering gate there is big circle house which know as falake smarak,who first Marathi cinema creator,a replace which surrounding with tree n play garden for children. at the upper side pandavleni caves shown,which is historical memory of pandvas, who's stay there alone journey which called as Van was."
Treasure of Buddhist caves,"Pandvaleni caves is present by the Mumbai - Nashik highway in the outskirts. One has to climb through 300 steps to reach the top of a hill to see these caves. There is an entrance fee of Rs.15 per adult, however, there were none in the counter when we went by 8 AM. The counter was to star ta 8:30 but there were so many morning walkers and joggers already in as the gates were open. These are 24 in number - and called Trirashmi Buddhist caves. These are also one of the oldest caves in Maharashtra - hosting 900 of the 1100 caves in India. There are 3 caves - which are big halls and might had been used for gathering and performing prayers. Cave 22 and 23 hosts big sculptures of Buddha. It takes around 1 hour to go across all these caves and see at leisure. Most of the caves are too small and not really requiring someone to get in and see."
Back in time ,"This place is just before u hit the nasik city if u travelling from Mumbai. A superb place to visit. Involves a climb of 20-30 minutes but absolutely worth it. There are some 18 caves and though not the best preserved, they are quite a sight. Some of the caves you need to remove ur shoes and enter since they are considered to be holy. The view from the top is also worth the climb definitely.. the cool breeze and the Green mountain and the City view is what you see. The caves ate circular and you end up going a full circle from where u get these views. Entry price is only 15rs and definitely worth it.  Must visit"
Not as great,It's around 250 steps up... and all caves look the same with nothing much exciting inside ... only 1-2 caves have something to see in it.:: unless u are really kicked about seeing them ... no point walking up with kids ....
Number one Historical Place in Nashik,You need to climb a couple of hundred steps to get up to the caves. Takes maximum 20 minutes for an average fit person to climb. The caves are worth the climb. Do visit if you are in Nashik
BACK TO 300 BC..,"PANDAVLENI Caves are located just at the outer boundaries of Nasik city. These caves are carved in a small rocky hill . These caves are Bhudhist caves built starting from possibly 2 /3 rd century BC onwards over a Period of possibly 600 years . Supposed to be one of the National heritage ..We visited on a rainy day ..slushy , no proper path ..ill designed railings to go up the hill..Managed it was worth the effort. Amazing to see the Kind Of work done 1500-2000 years ago..Inspiring .Aesthetically no comparison to Ajantha or Ellora caves.We can't make comparisons and look at the Monument for It's worth keeping in Mind the period during which they were developed ..2 investment maximum..Be prepared for zero public conveniences.."
Welll Preserved Caves,These were some of the best and most well preserved buddhist caves in Maharashtra. Prayers are still given in many of the temple complexs here. Infact a huge gathering of buddhist was taking place on the day we were there. There are about 24 caves with a lot of well preserved sculptures and pali enscripts with details of the donation given. It's a long way up though. Be prepared for some climbing.
Such a nice places and nice people ,"I'm a Japanese.Somehow, I feel I was greatly welcomed here.Caves from 2000 years ago.All of them are historically important.Some of them are even artistic.Those caves welcomed me.The nice view welcomed me.The breeze on the hill was comfortably welcomed me.The hill climb of about 10 minutes welcomed me by the exercise.Then, the people welcomed me.Where are you from?What's your name?Hello.Taking a photo together?And just NamasteThank you very much"
A wonderful sight for people who love ancient architecture,"Located close to Nashik and a wonderful trek leads you to this Buddhist marvel. Set of 24 caves. Not very far off from city, it is still a very peaceful place and gives a very beautiful panoramic  view of the city. Morning visit is good as compared to evening and during monsoon the trek is wonderful. Very similar to Elephant caves which the Mumbaikars have for their visits."
Nashik Version of Ellora Caves,Excellent Illustration of Buddhist architecture....Lovely place for a morning trek and get a great view of Nashik city.
Well maintained and clean enough .... as per indian standards!!!!,"- Worth seeing.- Clean enough, unlike other caves which stink.- Try seeing them early mornings with sunlight streaming in the caves.- Buddha Smrithi temple is adjacent.- Great city view from the caves.- Only a 20 minute climb. Can easily be done by older people too slowly. Proper stairs.- Rs 15 tickets only for adults. Timings 9 to 6 pm.- Please tell the guy at the stall that he should advise people not to throw the plastic food wrappers and bottles.- Nice hot Corn for Rs 20."
Old caves up the Hill,"Before you visit you will read stories of how Pandavas stayed in the caves.  You walk up the hill expecting some grand caves.  Once you climb to the top you see old caves with carvings.  You sit there taking in the beautiful view of Nashik, it sinks in that some one hundreds of years back climbed these hills and carved them.  Then you understand the beauty."
A reminder of ajanta caves,"This trek have around 200+ stairs .We went with my  MIL(  stricken with arthritis )so obviously for it was hectic and tiring but she  still enjoyed the caves . Don't miss the last caves.beautifically. carved ,eo many  buddha statues in a small area.Must go for trek lovers and try to go in the morning as high intensity sun will not let you enjoy the trek and views .You can view beautiful Nashik after reaching upstairs.Please keep torch for dark caves as dark caves have the best statues.Beaware of steep stairs and water is must while treking ."
very nice buddhist caves,Its required to take around 300-350 steps to reach here. But it's worth as the caves are amazing and Rich of carving in stones. There are around 40 caves here. But its worth to see. Some of the caves are amazing. One cave has big idol of lord buddha carving from stone itself.
Good,"It's a wonderful picnic spot, especially for families with children below 18. The area around has been developed beautifully with gardens and parks. Not ideal for old people since there's a long flight of stairs leading to the caves. Overall a good experience."
"Must visit place, takes only couple of hours ","Noteworthy points 1. Be prepared to climb up the stairs approximately 3002. There is a nominal entry ticket 3. Each cave is distinct 4. Awesome view of city and mountains near cave 15. Not many options to eat or drink6. Make sure you have sufficient juice(power) left in your camera, carry a powerbank7. Take some panoramas 8. Free parking 9. Kids are bound to have fun10. The caves are really crafted out of big mountains!"
Great historical place,Pandavleni the great historical place since pandavas living here. Having great budhas statues. Also having old satatues. In one mountain lot of things are there
"nice historical, interesting.","we visited these caves and they are nice to go, not kept so clean though, but nice historical visit."
Good Place to visit,"its a early morning trek, the place reminds of our ancient history and a must visit place when coming to nashik"
"Good surprise, hidden in Nashik","I was looking for places to visit on Google maps, happened to be around the pandav caves and was suggested by Google maps to visit!!! The place turned out to be a good outdoor evening family experience!!!There are about 24 caves, it's a 20-25 min walk up the hill (mostly stairs) and some of the caves are worth watching. There is a lot on information populated on your climb uphill that serves at good history lessons for kids (errr elders too). I have always loved learning history atleast Indian history, in a practical way i.e. visiting the sites physically."
Lara croft like feeling,"If the thought of seeing some piece of history 2000 yrs old and still so magnificent don't go here. The place is a jewel. The massive caves cut in stone, carvings of deities and inscription s on the walls are so amazing, they take u to another era. Luckily we went on a cloudy evening, the trek up was exhilarating. Lots of young kids enjoying all the way up... And the caves (despite being defaced by some miscreants) were magnanimous ly welcoming. Like some bastions of an Empire in the past"
Nice attraction for a short but refreshing trek!!,"situated within the city limits, its a nice place for early morning short trek!! You can get the landscape view of the nashik city from the top which is amazing."
"Good place to visit once, not much to expect","Pandavleni caves are good for one time visit or free time visit as it doesnt have much, to show. Just caves which are well maintained and you can visit it for a charge of Rs 15/- per person. Nothing too great about it. Just caves, well maintained. I suggest Ajanta Ellora are much better. You need to walk approx 200 stairs to reach these caves which are on a height."
Well maintined,Dont miss it if you are in Nashik. This place is considered next only to Ajanta and Ellora caves.The climb to the caves will take about 10-20 mins depending on your stamina.The caves have been maintained well and the city view from the top is amazing.It closes down at 6 pm so plan accordingly.
Delight for young adventurers,"It is said that these caves were built by the Buddhist monks some time in the 7th century AD .There are 24 caves of which some are really worth seeing and at par with the caves at Allora , near Aurangabad. It is also said that Pandavas during exile had taken refuge in this area, thus the name Pandavlina.These caves are located on Nashik Mumbai highway very close to the main highway on a conical hill in the midway.Its barely 2 kms from Hotel Express Inn. For a fit guy , its barely 20 minutes climb, for others , it may take up to 45 mins. The young  ones can also try reaching the top of this hill which is another 40 minutes climb along a narrow track. You can get a birds eye view of Nashik city from this area.Some people plan for a picnic lunch after the visit to the caves as there are shady areas.At the base of the hill before the climb starts , there is beautiful buddhist dome. Also, there is a Nakshatra garden, where there are medicinal plants and the plants you must worship as per your zodiac sign. A must see place if you visit Nashik."
Nice place,it was nice place from that place we can see whole city of nashik.  There are so many ancient caves which we can see get some information about ancient days. there is also water park where we can enjoy a lot.
Must visit if you're in the vicinity,"We spent a good part of a nice cool morning trekking up and enjoying the caves.Lots of history in this lovely hidden location. It is just off the highway. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to reach the top. There are steps up to climb all the way, they are not steep. Most of the time there is shade, but on a hot day it might get hard to climb. Along the way there are multiple boards with a lot of information. Do take time to read them. They will make your entire experience more meaningful.Carry some water with you.Once you get to the top, the caves are amazing. We took our time exploring each and every one of the 24 caves. Relatively well maintained. You will be asked to take your shoes off multiple times, as certain caves have religious significance.The view from the top is great as well. My kids age 11 and 9 loved the climb and the entire experience."
Heritage,"It's always soothing to visit such heritage like sites, where things are well maintained.Proper cleaning rooms, security persons available, entry tickets, superb beauty from the top, beautiful scenes to capture, the Pandavleni caves are really beautiful."
A place you can't miss in Nashik,"Pandavleni caves situated on a small hill 8 kms off Nashik city centre, is a set of Buddhist Viharas & one Chaitya. sculpted out of the rocks.Though not having the grandeur of the caves at Ajanta or Ellora, the caves are quite impressive in both its architectural construct and beautiful sculptures. Apart from the beauty of these structures, one also gets a beautiful panoramic view of the Nashik city from the hill top. Reaching the top involves climbing up a flight of stairs & took us about 10-12 minutes."
Nice spot for morning track...,"Not far from City, located on Nasik-Bombay highway, the caves are based on a small hill.  It is not a steep climb (300-400 steps).  The architectural crafts are worth watching.  There is a nominal entry fee after 0900 hrs.  The best time is to go in the early morning when you will see most of the people coming for their morning walk/trek.We went there for a family get together and trek and had fun."
Nice place to visit,Nice place to visit in nashik.it offers panaromic views of Nashik city.Good for short morning trek.
Abandoned and great,"what I liked most about the caves is that we were nearly alone and definitely the only tourists. Very nice caves, fine carvings and interesting for anyone. Not comparable to Ellora (in size), but some of the scuplture are very nice. If you´re in Nashik, this is a good option. You can continue your walk all the way up to the top of the hill and be rewarded with a great view of the city and the surrounding hills."
excellent place...,"Great surrounding....pandav leni are located on top of the hill,,,,Once, you reached at the top, you will see scenic veiw of Nashik. Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak is very huge and built on the remembrance of father of Indian Film Industry.Always feel to visit again and again."
Best Place of Nashik,"I think this place ranks better than any other place in nashik. It is nested above a hill with nice panaromic view of the city and some of the cave structure themselves are quite nice and well preserved, the complex itself is very big."
Evening hike ,The caves are quite spectacular and quite an average hike.It took us around 20minutes to reach.We took some photos there.It was a pleasant site at sundown.There is a difficult terrain with boulders above the level of the caves.We weren't prepared with the attire and it was quite late for the climb.We left it for another time.There are a few stalls selling chips and biscuits and we found grilled corn too!Overall it's a good moderate climb and one can enjoy with friends and family!Also some nice pictures around the statues can be taken.
Great day activity,We were staying in nashik and decided to visit the caves. It took about 2 hours. Perfect fast day outing for the family or a couple. Caves were awesome but not as elaborate as ajunta or ellora.
Worth a visit,People interested in exploring can visit this place. Good 2-3 hours can be spent trolling through various caves. The temple is carved out of the mountain is beautiful.
Magical,"An absolutely enchanting and captivating place. The devotion, skill and ultimate splendor in the building is admirable and captivating. A beautiful place. A must see."
Worth the hike,Beautiful temple carved into the stone of the mountain.  Be sure to see it if you're in town!!!!!!!!!
Pandav Leni and Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak,These are one of the oldest 24 no caves in the middle of a hill typically on the lines of Ellora but a scaled down version. One has to climb about 200 meters to reach them with no formal steps. The caves are as old as 2000 years with some stone idols still intact. One can get a panoramic view of the Nasik city from here.At the foot of the hill is a smarak of Dadasaheb Phalke who is considered to be the father of Indian Film Industry. A Buddhist stupa with a surrounding garden makes a good ambiance. Golden Buddha idol and the hall are quiet and pleasing.
Visit if you like history,Beautiful caves. Lots to walk and explore. You can easily spend 2-3 hours if you like. There are many caves.
Superb cave....,It's beautiful place...you have walk to the top..lot of people come for morning walk...on the top there are around 30 caves beautifully carved and of different sizes....you can carry tiffins and can enjoy with your family and friends.....do carry water bottles....you get to see beautiful city view....below there is huge park you can visit but they charge for the same.....best place to enjoy your day.....
Heritage caves,"Very old caves built/carved by Pandavas during their halt at Nashik during Mahabharata period. Up on the hill on Mumbai-Agra national highway no. 3, on the outskirts of Nashik city"
Well worth a visit - reminds you of the Ellora caves,"Not unlike the Ellora caves, but on a smaller scale.  A group of 24 caves carved between the 3rd century BC and the 2nd century AD.  You climb about 200 steps through a beautiful wooded hillside to reach a terrace of caves carved out the granite, some simple cells, others more elaborate with pillared galleries, stupas or figures of the Buddha.  It was quiet, but probably got busier later in the day."
"ancient caves but nicely preserved monuments, good tour with prasanna purple trips",this was a nice experience to see the history of mankind. This tour is a memorable as this was made possible by purple trips for us even though they had to take a detour and go out of the way to make us see this monumnets
A View of Nashik from the hills - Emperor Views.,"Amazing view into the life of kings and queens and monasteries of that era. The stone lounges, temples, bedrooms, waterways, pools and everything that would be expected as a royal of those days - can be experienced here!"
2000 years old beautiful Buddhist caves,"Pandavleni caves are 2000-year-old, and it was built by the Jain Kings. It is a group of 24 Hinayana Buddhist Caves, which date back between 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. These caves are at a distance of 8 km from Nashik.Caves are located midway up the Trirashmi Hill, some 100 m above the surroundings, facing north-east. Climb to caves is not too hard and the atmosphere around the caves is very peaceful. Avoid going there in hot weather as you have to climb few stairs to reach to the caves. It is a must visit place if you are in and around Nashik."
Caves like Ajanta-Ellora,Located outside the city. Take 30 mins to reach there. Isolated place. Located above the hill rock. You have to climb many stairs to reach there. Ticket price are Rs. 30/each. Children free. There are many caves with Buddhist monks used to meditate and prayer place.
Hidden Gem of Nashik,Very good place to spend time. Didn't expect that Nashik would have such kind of place. Small trek but totally worth it....Offers excellent panoramic views of the city
Combination of Nature and History,The attraction of this place is essentially the cave sculptures ( similar to what you see in Ajanta/Ellora ).   The path to the caves is climb over a hill.   The climb is not difficult and itself is a good experience.   Better to visit the place early hours in the morning.  The cave sculptures are decent.
Perfect place to peace lovers and art lovers,"These are one of the oldest caves in maharashtra. Can be seen in around 3hrs. Have steps so please wear waliking or racing shoes.Have some water bottles with you above there is no stalls or hotels.Will recommend to visit in day light. Place is really quit and peacful. You can see major part of nashik from top of caves.At the base of caves there is one garden called phalke smarak, you can also visit this."
Tour in Buddhist caves,"This place located on Mumbai- Agra highway. This is heritage architecture, all statue of Buddha & cave on hilltop name as ""Pandav Leni"". Nice place to visit it. This place popular for morning walk, trek. Must visit this place."
Good visit for ancient site,This is one of the well preserved monuments. Worth a visit. There are too many steps if you have got old parents to accompany you
Fun trip,"A place where you can feel like out of the world. This is a small trek, best time is from 6am-8am. Its a good place to go with family and friends or even solo."
Amazing work,"You have to climb a little. One can visit Dadasaheb Phalke Memorial and there is way to climb the stairs to visit the Caves. The work done by our ancestors, we should really proud of"
A long walk up hill ,"A bit disappointed by the lack of care for such an ancient monument.Graffiti and rubbish abound.No getting away from the fact thst its an impressive series of caves and carvings, but like many things in India, its not well maintained"
Beautifully carved caves,These are very beautifully carved caves. Few of them are more interestingly carved. There is a small entry fee. Big statues can be observed inside the caves.
Beautiful Buddhist caves,"Caves on a hilltop...good morning trek. heritage architecture visit, very old caves of buddhist (nothing to do with Pandavas as apparent from name) with nice carvings. worth climbing more then 200 steps. and u get a nice panoramic view of nashik city from top"
Great for roaming,"This place is huge! After you look at the caves, you can enjoy the lawn or the amphitheatre. They also have a café. It's a great place to spend the afternoon."
Beautiful ,"Great caves very near to Nashik on the outskirts. You have to climb up quite a lot, but the caves are very interesting and in surprisingly good condition. These are mainly Buddhist caves and some are almost 2000 years old. Enjoyable walk. The stairs, caves etc are all well maintained."
Good trek,"Small trek, great views ! The caves are pretty and the carvings in stone are intricate. Just shows the patience of the sculptors in that era."
Best for Early Morning Visits,"One of the very popular spots for peoples in Nashik, as it offers great spot for morning walkers to enjoy the climate. The site is a historical structure basically dealing with Buddhist structures decorating the caves. Some of the caves are very beautiful, and some inhabits small water pools. It becomes a scenic beauty during monsoons."
Pandavleni Caves ; Peek in to life of Buddhist Monks,"First let's get the meaning right. Pandavleni Caves are nothing to do with Pandavas of Hindu epic Mahabharata. ""Leni"" in local language Marati  means Caves.Built between 3rd century BC and 2nd century AD by ancient  Satavahana and Kashtrap Kings, these caves showcases a lot about life of Buddhist Monks. Popularity of Buddhism during early period is depicted beautifully in these caves and sculptures. Leave alone Kings and riches, even commoners such as merchants and fishermen built caves for Buddhist Monks. The rise  of Buddhism in India post Asoka, faith of public on the religion and wide spread adoption  is evident in these Caves. Large Buddha statues and stupas are must see. Liked Cave number 10, 18 and 20. It is some kind of place for Monks to live and mediate ( ""Viharas"") There many small rooms with place to sleep and mediate. Cave number 18 is the only ""Chaitra"" or prayer room. There are totally 24 caves , small and big.The caves are situated on top of Trirshmi hills. Be ready to climb at least few hundred steps  though  you will enjoy the journey. Carry your own water. You may have to spend anything between 1.5 to 2 hrs here. The place is just 3 to 4 kms away from popular Hotels in Nashik such as Taj Gateways, Express Inn.Entey fee is Rs 15 for Indians and Rs 200 or 3 USD for foreign nationals. Entry is Free for children below 12 years. Though maintained by Archeological Society of India, the site could have been tourist friendly with tourist guides, booklets etc.After seeing some of these Buddhist caves , one wonder how such a religion could not sustain its popularity in India. Is it only because later Hinduism was supported by Kings or was it something else.. Time to ponder and learn about ride and fall of religions."
A good place for trekking and archeology,"A wonderful place. One has to climb about 250 steps to get to the caves. Steps aren't difficult as they are long and about 6""-7"" in height. Parking is also not an issue. However you won't get anything at the top and its preferable to carry water with you. There are about 24 caves and they are mostly Buddhist. The road to the top is through dense forest and even in the afternoon one can climb up."
Refreshing,"Good time to go morning before 10. Clean, quiet, fresh. The climb itself is not very steep, can be managed by most people.If u r keen on history etc then I guess there is a lot of it as well. But I was not that keen. To me it was more of health and fresh air."
Excellent Jain history,"These caves are more than 2000 years old.there are 29 caves.many idols of Lord Buddha,Jain Gurus can be seen in these caves.very close to our hotel"
Refreshing Trek,"I went to Pandavleni with some of my friends. We went there at the dawn to catch a glimpse of the sunrise, at around 6. Has a good parking space for all the vehicles, after which is the trek. After climbing around 1000 stairs, one gets to watch breathtaking scenery of Nasik. One of the greatest heritage sites, the place boasts of ancient caves and carvings. in the background, one can hear peacocks' lou lou. Overall, it is the best trekking place at Nasik."
Nice Place for Trek,This is one of the best spots from where you can see the Nashik City from top of hill... The place is awesome when it rains and gives quit a thrill for trekking for common people..
Nice attraction in Nashik,"Pandavleni caves are amongst good heritage attractions in Nashik.Situated close to the Ambad area on Nashik outskirts, this would be a good half a day activity. One can park their cars down and then proceed to climb up the historic caves which were once the abode of Buddhist monks. Contrary to popular perception, this place has nothing to do with the Pandavs or the Mahabharata."
Good for family ,It is very good place specifically for kids..  Lovely garden.  Lawn.. Flowers.. Artificial lighting attracts alot
Amazing,"One of the best location in Nasik , i went there with my wife , its located on a mountain , we have to walk through the lane , good exercise , nice beautiful view of nasik city & other mountains from the caves , caves are historic & very old , they have buddhist scriptures & idols of Gautama buddha on the wall"
Best place for treking,"Mostly people try this place for trekking ,from here it has nice view of Nashik.Having car parking in the base of this hill"
"Ancient caves near Ambad, Nashik","Pandavleni caves are a set of about two dozen caves situated atop hills on the outskirts of Nashik city.Also known as the Trirashmi Buddhist caves, these are believed to be carved between 3 century BC to 2 century AD. Most of these caves were used by Buddhist disciples as a meeting/ prayer hall (Viharas).One can take their car upto a point and then need to climb uphill, the walk being slightly tricky specially if visiting during the rainy season. Visiting the whole place will take better part of the morning"
More than 40 caves on a hill,"Pandavleni is actually regular destination for exercising for Nashik public.It has excellent caves.There are more than 40 caves which were supposed to be built in 2nd century,According to me these are largest caves after ajanta n ellora.2 hours are enough to observe each cave.Visit during sunny day."
Great place,"Its old ancient caves, great place, slight have to mountain with steps with 20-30 mins, green tress surround it, nice spot, rainy season good to see as good climate, dew and green"
"Nicest getway for halfday for family or groups,from nashik","Caves are upon a lonely rocky hill located near to nashik city.Nice Curved Climbing path towards the caves is beautiful & perfect workout place.There are loads of Buddhist rock caves which has historical importance.Mostly unfinished, but has stunning design and finishing at some places.The planning & volume of work went behind them in enormous.I went with friends and here are some tips* Go up to the top of hill(caves are located halfway from the bottom), if you r ready for a steep dangerous climb.Its worth it!!!.* Have some snacks in hand before u start from bottom of the hill, there are none at top* If you want some good photos , visit before noon."
Good place to practice for Hill run!,It is nice place during rainy season as everywhere there is nice greenery! The Pandav caves are exellent carvings with historic importance. At the base of the hill there is nice track for joggers.
205 big steps to be climbed,"Has loads of caves inside with primarily just engravings on them. Is fine for a one time see but due to the stairs, not advisable with small kids & senior citizens."
Those who love history!,Great day out with Phalke smarak at the ground. It offers little hiking and historic sight seeing. Cleanliness requires some attention.
Nice to see Rock Cut Caves,These are very old rock cut Budha caves. You have to climb more than 100 steps. But it is worth to see the beauty of the caves. Some of the caves are unfinished. Panoramic view of Nashik is worth to see from these caves.
Buddha Leni,This is not Pandav Leni.This is Buddha Leni (Trirashmi Caves).Actual name is Buddha leni. There is no any relation of Pandvas here.
A decent place but needs to have better information outside each cave,Historical - yes.... Informative - NO!They could have done better by providing information outside each cave.
Place Must Visit,Steps from the bottom lead to the caves. - The caves are clean and well-maintained - The art and architecture is great - Best to visit in winters (Nov to Feb) I observing this cave from my childhood & I must say that now the local administration taking good care of this cave but still they need good promotion activities to attract maximum tourist .
Trek towards Mythology and History,This set of caves is a very good example of out Indian history and mythology melting together.  The caves which have been reported are supposed to be used by the Pandavas during their exile.  It provides a nice view of the lake which formed at the spot from where Hanuman is supposed to have jumped towards the sun. The Budhist meditation centre at the foot of the hill is also worth a visit.  There is a public garden too where the group members not willing to undergo the trek can rest and relax and have a good time.
Crafts of this Cave are really beautiful.....,This cave is one of the great examples of beautiful crafts & art which has its own history with Mahabharat & Buddha era. I observing this cave from my childhood & I must say that now the local administration taking good care of this cave but still they need good promotion activities to attract maximum tourist .
Must visit in Nashik,"- The caves are located half way up a lone hill. Steps from the bottom lead to the caves.- The caves are clean and well-maintained- The art and architecture is great- Best to visit in winters (Nov to Feb)- View from the top is great- It is believed that Pandavas (from Mahabharata) had a stopover at this place, during their exile...hence the name"
Archeological delight near Nasik,"Nasik is home to beautifully rock cut caves carved between the 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD. The caves numbering 24 are Buddhist caves and many of them have elaborate sculptures & exquisite carvings. Majority of the caves are viharas and only one cave is Chaitya cave and has a stupa. Located on a hill, one has to climb several steps to reach the caves. There is an entry fee of Rs 15 for Indian visitors. The view of the sprawling city of Nasik from the top is breathtaking. As per mythological legends Pandavas are believed to have stayed in these caves during their 'agyatvaas', hence the name given to these caves. But there is no evidence to this fact."
Verynice,"Its awesome place to visit , you can see the art on walls , but the main thing is its location . from here you can see the nashik ,whick looks very beautifull . its long distance to go upside from starting . so little hectic .but nature lovers will enjoye it ."
"Intricate, spectacular chiseled figures from a bygone era preserved in Nashik City!","This magnificently preserved hand chiseled carvings in the rocks of religious figures, sleeping quarters,prayer areas, filigree patterns on entrance pillars & windows allowing natural light in are a must see when in Nashik City.  The cool interior of the caves were a welcome respite from the sweltering April heat.I was in absolute awe as I examined the figures & structures.N.B. Foreigners are charged Rs100 & the exact amount must be tendered as change is not always available"
good view,Good to visit if you are fit and can climb.beautiful view of city but the garden downstairs is a big disappointment if you have seen caves in aurangabad you can skip it.
Interesting site,"To really understand the history and what it is. look it up before you go there. Its not really that difficult to get up (15 min maybe in a slow tempo). Some of the caves are really interesting.  the site also gives a fairly good overview of the city. Its not farther away than that you actually could walk from Gateway hotel or Express inn if you stay there (add 20-30 min oneway then).You can do the whole visit in less than 1 hour but recommend to plan 1,5 not to be in stress.(including walking up and down to the caves)"
Good,Good nice but cant trek so high! as there are more than 300 steps overall but is a godd oine to see for
You will have to walk and climb along the hill...a lot,"Basic cave structures at the top of the hills, try going when there is good light as the caves are dark and not much can be seen. If you love hiking the climb will be worth it..Also you can see entire of Nashik from the top which is just lovely."
"If you are in Nashik city, please visit this place. To see the caves, one has to climb the hill, not very difficult.","July is rainy days in this place. We enjoyed the rain along with site seeing. There is a garden at the starting point worth seeing .There is also Dadasaheb Phalke Museum, Musical fountain,etc  worth to see at this point."
Well preserved,A well preserved sight after a steep climb up. Quite easy to access. The view from the top of surrounding city of Nashik is nice. Worth going if the weather permits and best to be there early in the morning just after 8pm to avoid the crowds. They sell drinks and snacks at the entrance before the climb up.
Nice historical caves located on Outskirts and easily accessible..,Visited this historical pandavleni caves which is located in Ambad area on main highway to Mumbai was here with family nd kids..It is one long journey to top which is quite cumbersome to climb along with family..Request fellow travellers to travel in broad daylight as its not much safe at night and pick-pockets also foam freely..There is nice little garden downstairs and play area for kids ...On the top view is fantastic nd recommend to visit in early morning for a pleasant experience..Entry fees is reasonable so no issues with that...Place is little bit filthy but definitely better than other monuments near by nashik..Nice photography is recommended..
Trirashi caves- modern name ' Pandavleni Caves',"Thease caves are about 6 to 7 kms away from Nashik city main bus stand, situated on Mumbai Agra Highway. You can easily reach by auto or even by city bus, at about any time of the day. The climb is not very stiff & the hight of the caves may not be more than 400 to 450 ft from the hillock. You can observe eye-catching panoramic view of the Nashik city from the top.Pandavlena caves roughly belong to the 1st Century B.C. to 4th Century A.D period. This group of about 24  Buddhist caves is one of the most important in Western India, particularly interesting on account of the large rare inscriptions of considerable historical interest found here. They were excavated between the  second half of the 1st Century B.C. and the end of the 2nd Century A.D. by the Buddhist of the Hinayana Faith, who worshipped Buddha in symbolical form. The images of Buddha carving in some of the caves are later additions made by the devotees of the Mahayana faith in CIRCA 4th - 6th Century  A.D. The ancient name of the place was ""Trirashmi"" means the triple royal . The name ""Pandavlena caves"" is modern application.  One can definitely arrange a picnic trip specially on some rainy day with family & freinds and enjoy the beauty.."
Holidays,A place worth visiting. On Agra-Mumbai highway this place is maintained by ASI and Rs 15 is charged with every adult indian. The place is famous for the excavation of around 20 caves. There are stone sculptures and painting on the walls. You can see the highway from the top. In rainy season this place is beautiful. How ever youngsters have made this a lust point. Sad. Not all the caves are worth watching .
Its old Buddhist caves not pandav caves,There is a group of 24 caves serves as viharas for buddhist community. Worth visit place if you are in nashik. Its open upto 5.30 in evening.
Historical stuff ,nice experience to see the archeological beauty at height...nice visit but place was lil dirty..but good place to visit
Archaeologically and aesthetically beautiful..,The place is quite beautiful. The caves are splendid. The view of city from the top is lovely. I recommend rainy season for it.
tracking,its good place to see monuments and tracking a small tracking its all morties of lord buddha it at mountasin top
Nice place with fresh air and very good view,"Good time to visit is early morning, else by early evening you have a lot of steps to climb view for top is good a nice place to visit when you have time in nashik"
Good trek for beginners,"The real name is Budhha-leni but some people changed the name to Pandavleni with a story that says Pandavs stayed here.  Nice carvings that takes you back in time.  A good trek for beginners.  You feel fresh once you reach midway where you're s'posed to (you can't go all the way up).  A good place to be with family, extended family, friends.  The municipal corporatation does its best to preserve it and disallows plastic bottles etc.  However, Indians will alway be Indians.  Please do your best and follow the rules and I'm sure you'll have a refreshing time."
a nice attraction at nashik,"Its a great place to visit, if visiting Nashik. it represents history. nice artrechture, nice place to hangout with friends and family"
Historic n cultural location,Caves have historic relevance and are situated on top of mountain. Normal people can visit via stairs however few adventurous can climb n trek on mountain from front or back side. You can also climb till the top from where you can have great views on nasik. Caves are having Buddhist sculptures carved in rock which are worth visit.
Hidden from the world,"Good time to visit is early morning, else by early evening so as to beat the Sun while climbing the hill.Its not exactly a trek to visit these cave but have to climb steps from the bottom of the hill to the cave which is located approx half way distance of the height of the hill.Good place for a day's picnic with friends n family... provided you carry your own food n drinks(no alcohol).Tip: Great view of Nasik city & fresh cool air to breath in!"
Super place,A very nice caves complicated for elderly people but worth visiting to see olden cave formations during Mahabharata stage
Ancient time revisited,Pandav leni is one of attraction to be visited whenever one is in nashik.It is old monument and must visit place.It located on mumbai agra highway.The leni are in mountain you have to climb but they have made proper steps here. There are more than 10 caves in which leni of Buddha are made out of stone.There is  minimum visit fee for this place. It well connected to city by all local transport system.one of more attraction is falke smarak which is at base of this leni.Must visit place.
Unbelievable!,"How did they manage to build such amazing structures with such few tools? If you love architecture and history, you must visit these caves! Beautiful!"
Ancient wonder,"Situated on a hilltop adjacent to Nasik city, this is a group of 24 nos caves, some of which are even 2000 years old. The caves were built by rock cutting & carving & as opined by the experts, these caves were used as worship place for budhism. The caves are still in good condition. Inside of some caves have inscription on Buddha & his life. One has to climb a considerable height through rocky stair to reach the place which needs lot of physical effort. Beside the caves, hilltop provides a nice aerial view Nasik city. It seems that, not much tourist come here to see these excellent caves & it's sculptures. However, a better maintenance of the place & little more publicity may not only boost the tourism prospect but also help the interested people to explore this ancient treasure."
It's awesome ,Caves are really awesome. Worth the tracking to come here. All statues are made from single stone. Statues are awesome. Must came again with friends.
Rock-cut Architecture with different styles,"The caves are carved into a mountain, and reached by stairs. Its a good climb up, its best to do this climb in summer months early morning. These caves were made between 4th century BC and 12th century AD. These are Buddhist caves, and one can see the different sculpture styles develop over time. These caves have a myth of being connected to Pandavs (Mahabharata), there is no historic evidence to suggest this. For architecture buffs and history buffs good place to visit. The caves also have an ancient water harvest system, and a great view of the valley below."
Rock architecture glimpse,"A short treck to the caves from the main road and you can see the whole city from there! Historical buff may enjoy this place even better. Caves are numbered from 1 to 24 and each cave depicting a unique style of interior and rock sculpture of the period. Cave number 3, 8 and 18 are bigger and grandeur than the others."
Ancient caves & good sample of Ancient Architecture.,Visited this place with Friends. This is a good sample of how people lived thousands years ago. These caves had great mythological importance.
Good Architecture And a Nice View,One has to climb a good number of stairs to get to the caves so it is not recommendable for old people to visit.
Interesting Insight into Ancient India!,"Firstly, be aware that the path leading to the caves - perched on top of a hill overlooking Nashik - is rather steep and requires sensible footwear.  Sandal wearers may struggle!To all Pandavleni visitors: please(!!!) do not follow the maddening trend of ripping your ticket into a thousand pieces and scattering all over the path on return from the caves.  This litter ruins the experience for others and is ridiculous given the caretakers have provided bins at the exit.  I found it particularly frustrating at the number of torn ticket stubs littering the walk up the hill.The caves themselves, of which there are 24 of varying quality, are a great insight into how people lived hundreds of years ago.  There are two huge caves carved deep into the cliffside which would have housed more than 50 people in each by my estimate.The views of Nashik are superb and the caves are relatively well maintained.  Tickets are 5rs for Indians and 100rs for foreigners.Take a bottle of water from the vendors assembled in the car park area at the foot of the hill as there is nothing at the summit.  The caves are less than 15 mins by car from both Jupiter Meuse and Express Inn hotels for guests staying there thinking of making a trip."
GOOD PLACE TO VISIT TO KNOW HOW THE  EARLY HUMANS STAYED IN THESE CAVES,We visited  these  caves  last   march  with my family and my brother family.We had to climb all the way  up by  steps  and  climbing  up was  very  good and little bit  of tiring  and  good  exercises. I don't remember  the  number of steps that we had to counted to reach the  top. In fact  my brother son who was only  three years old  climbed the steps all the way to reach the top.  On the way  while climbing we saw  various birds     chirping (  Bulbus - Mynas - cuckoos ) and  how  nice  it was  to  look them  flying pass  you.  The view while climbing was also good  and  the steps are well maintained and kept by the Government  so that the  tourist  can visit these  caves without  much difficulty.When we reach the top  it was  really amazing to  see  how  these  caves were built  and  how the  people stay.  Even  water  was well stored inside the caves  in separate chambers  for their for  consumption. Also  a  guide  is need to  explain the  mythological and  historical  importance of these cavesYou can  take  photos  - no problems - we did take  lovely photos  of the caves and  also of some statues that were built. No doubt the  caves are well maintained. From the top  we can also have  a  panorama view  of  all the  area  around you and it was looking great.  Inside the caves it was  nice  and  cool.
Better than expected,"Ok it's not ellora or ajunta but it worth the visit if you are in nasik. Lonely planet indicates that only 2 caves are interesting the others being empty but that's wrong, it was a good surprise for us"
Mesmerising stone work done 2000 years ago,Visited this place at around 9am on a Monday morning. Was completely empty and had a lot of time to explore the caves in details. Lot of Buddist influence and well maintained.
Awesome,Great experience.well maintained.breath holding stayed and architecture. However the place does require a guide and some details to explain the mythological / historical importance of the place. Worth visiting the place if you are in nashik
Pandavas,this is on top of the hill. You have to climb like 1-2 km's. thereafter you get to historian architecture sculptures. The story of Pandavas and sita ma. best time to go in the morning. you can see the entire city from the top. photography is allowed.
Caves worth seeing,5000 years old caves with amazing history. Nice place for people who like meditating. about 200 steps to get there but worth it. We get a very nice view of Nasik city from here.
Ancient caves located near Nashik (Pathardi Phata area) alongside Mumbai-Nashik expressway. It involves a climb of about,Ancient caves located near Nashik (Pathardi Phata area) alongside Mumbai-Nashik expressway. It involves a climb of about 30 mins to reach the top. Very beautiful view of Nashik from the top
A visit worth climbing,The place is really nice with ancient Buddhist carvings. The climb up is reasonable and you get a good view of nashik city.
Peaceful,"This takes you back to the time of Lord Buddha. Entry charges are Rs. 5/- for Locals  and Rs. 100/- for Foreigners.The caves are numbered, but the significance is not explained anywhere.A good 360 degree view of Nasik city is visible from this place.I wouldn't say its a must visit place in Nasik...but it's not bad..."
A good small trek,These caves are quite ancient ones with Buddhist statues and cravings. One can complete a trek and get down within an hour or so. They also provide scenic view of the city
Little compared to Ellora and Ajanta caves,"It is a little place compared to the Ellora and Ajanta caves, but is worth visiting while you are in Nashik. The climb to the caves is a long walk."
A long walk up for a good view,"Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon in December. There was a decent crowd, but nothing that would be bothersome. The most strenuous part was the walk up the caves and I would recommend wearing flats or sneakers for comfort. Also we started sweating on a winter afternoon, so summers will be very oppressive to climb in that heat,specially afternoons. Once up, there is a ticket of minimal amount (rs5). If you check out the pics, you would see some beautiful carving into the stones. Pillars and sculptures have been carved out of the stone around 2nd AD. However a lot of it has faded. The pathway is also not smooth and thus the shoes will make all the difference. the view of the city is lovely. The timings are 8.30 to 5.30 am. Buy your water and eating from the parking area since nothing is available once you reach the top. Another suggestion, elderly who are not too fit should give this place a skip due to the strenuous climb."
worth going,its a beautiful place. 202 steps on hill. bit difficult to climb particularly for people who have crossed age of 40 yrs. But once you reach you forget all. keep adequate time to spend there. just relax. very peaceful.
Excellent find,"A well maintained path leads up to the caves (make sure you have sensible shoes on and plenty of water as it's a bit of a climb!) the caves are amazing and it cost 100 rupees to get in (foreigner price,  Indians get in for 5 rupees). Has some great views over Nashik."
Mini Ellora..i felt so!!,One of the must visits places in Nashik. 2 to 3 KM from Nashil city. 20 to 30 min climb. But worth it!!
Long walk up the hill for the caves,"This place has a nominal Rs 5 per head entry charge. Its a long 15-20 minute walk (on stone stairs) uphill to see the caves. As you visit this place you keep wondering how these carvings were made in times when there were no modern tools. This place is an ideal place for a family visit with kids. It is well preserved and becomes crowded on holidays & weekends. It has a great view of the entire city. The Caves need to be maintained a little better as you can see rubbish in & around the cave spaces - Its an issue with people more than anything else. Its just one of the few good things to cut time on, within Nashik."
Spell bound by the architecture/ carvings!,"It's a 15-20 minute climb up the stairs to the caves. Once there, it's well worth the climb. The caves are extremely well carved and definitely worth a visit. The entry fees are a meagre Rs 5 per person. The property is well maintained and you also get a good arial view of the Nashik city from atop. The Pandavs from Mahabharata era  had stayed here during their exile and therefore, it has a lot of historical significance."
Nice view but caves disappoint,The walk uphill is nice provided weather is good. View from the top is nice. But the caves themselves disappoint. Not much to see there. Nothing much to eat or drink available at the site
Bird view of Nashik,Bird view of Nashik can be seen from this place.The caves are not so decorated but worth of seeing. Children's will have surely fun.
Back in time,"This place is a must visit if you happen to be in nashik, A small trail of about 30 minutes takes you back in time. As you visit this place you keep wondering how these carving were made in times when there was no machinery or electricity. This place is an ideal place for a family visit with kids. It is well preserved, and becomes crowded with people on weekends."
Good trekking to the caves,Not much to see compared to Ajanta Ellora caves but good place to visit. Nice view of the city from top. Parking also available till the point you can take car.
2nd century caves!,A small 30 min trail through steps to reach the caves. Nice to see the carvings on the walls and the statues.
A wonderful day out!,"Wow! Hard to imagine somebody, sometime in the past, actually carved those caves with a chisel! U can still see the marks! Not only caves and Buddha images but complete mediation halls carved tens of meters into the rock face! Foreigners are charged 100 Rupees though!"
A beautiful surprise awaits you ...,"These caves eclipse those on Elephanta Island off Mumbai - the statues are in better condition and the walk up the hillside is tranquil, if a little strenuous. This was a delightful discovery - and one we'd recommend to anyone."
Master Piece,"The ascent to the ancient rock-cut Buddhist caves, accessible by steps well-shaded by trees, is much easier than expected. The prayer hall and cells set into the convex face of the hill about 2,000 years aqo are evidence of the faith of those who painstakingly chiselled them with the simplest of tools. These, along with rock carvings of the Buddha and bodhisattvas and tanks cut into the rock for water transport visitors back centuries to when the caves were inhabited by monks. At the base of the Pandu Lena hill is the Buddha Hall, a large domed space resonant with chants, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak dedicated to the father of lndian cinema.The cave is a master piece and is compulsory visit for tourists."
Nice hike,Hike was nice...caves are like any other buddhist caves... However amazing views from the top ...go at around 4 pm for nice sunset view and of the adjoining plateau
carved caves,"One of the fine sightseeing in nasik. Need to cover steps to reach..but accessible, not much tiring. Enjoyable either in morning time or post lunch."
Nice trek with a touch of history,The trek upto Pandavleni caves is quite easy and pleasant. Perfect for an early morning/ sunrise view.
Sunrise Spot,"If you are in Nashik, do not miss this place. Ideal time to visit is early morning. Sunrise view in the vicinity of ancient Buddhist caves is a different experience in itself. At the foothills there's a new construction of Budh Vihar where people offer their prayers. Jogging, Yoga, Cycling is a common sighting in adjoining garden. Time required: 2 hrs. maxDo carry water bottle!"
Excellent experience,Lovely caves. Loved them.  Lots to climb - but with many trees can be really nice weather.  Avoided Steps and climbed the mountainside was fun
Superb artwork & caves,Pandavleni caves which is best example of superb artwork & caves which shows footprints of our great Indian culture & heritage also it tales you various stories about Mahabharat era & Buddha era. As a time goes this caves are preserve very well by local governing body & aware people of the city. Now days management is improved a lot over here. This place can be a great treat for History lover people.
nice,very huge caves of Budha . It has very nice architecture. However not many places to eat inside. But the experience was extremely nice. Have to travel a lot to reach to the top
Good Explore...,It is a set of 24 caves mainly of Buddha carvings. Set on top of the hill with almost 200 steps to climb. Really enjoyed the view of Nashik city from the top.
"Steep trek, visit before 5pm",This attraction involves an upward climb of around half an hour. Entry from the gate at ground level is closed after 5pm. Make sure you visit this early in the day to avoid the heat.
"Underrated gem , which is a must visit !","Amazing 3 BC vintage caves, which shows the superior capabilities of the people 2300 years back. Very important for young children to understand our heritage beyond mandirs , masjids and tombs. Huge experience.And another amazing thing is how well it has been maintained, neat and clean, amazing example for modern india."
Definitely worth visiting,These Himayana Buddhist caves carved between 300 BV to 200 AD are definitely worth visiting. They provide a glimpse on the lives of Buddhist monks. Many of the caves have beautiful carved statues. The water resource management scheme is also extremely interesting.Very close to Nashik. It takes about 20 min by car and you have to climb about 300 steps to reach the caves.
Easy Climb!,it was fun climbing the stairs to the caves... the view of the city from the top is pretty amazing. beautiful caves. People should stop loitering these beautiful caves.
Half a day time required for a good visit,"You defentlly need atleast half a day to visit this place. Better if you do this in the morning as you need to climb up to the caves. By the time we reached here it was already 4:00 and hence did not makeany sense going all the way to the temple, so a must do for me on my next visit."
Ancient and Amazing,"I could never imagine a cave from 1 BC could be so intricately carved. Buddhism is known for simplicity. You can see the grandeur of Buddhism here in all its simplicity.Situated on a hill, surrounded by a forest of custard apples, these caves are loaded with memories and Buddhist architecture. Not crowded, quiet and clean.I recommend a quick visit to this place and you would not believe Nashik had so much history attached to it."
Morning atmosphere there is hard to beat,When you walk up to the caves it is like leaving something behind. When you reach the top you'll be amazed how huge these caves are and how detailed certain paintings are. Great spot for an early morning hike.
Beautiful caves,I would have given excellent  ranking had I not visited Ajanta Ellora caves. It's smaller version  of Ellora caves. Only exception is extent of sculpture in the caves. The hills on which caves are located is very green n  have Custard apple and Imli (tamarind) trees in wild. Surprisingly I found wash room very clean compared to other places.
Historical Caves!!,"The Pandavleni caves have got a great history behind them which dates back to few centuries. Just located off the Mumbai- Nashik highway in south of Nashik, these caves can definitely capture your imagination.  It displays Hindu and Buddhist artifacts in the caves. It has few steps to climb to get to the caves(7-10 mins). Would definitely recommend if you are in Nashik."
"Must see historical religious site, ancient Buddhist caves","It is quite a climb, but easy to do for all those who are fit. The stairs are well laid out, steep only at places with a railing to hold on to for those who find it difficult to climb. It is green and shady, yet better to go in the morning before the sun climbs as the lighting and cool of the caves make it good."
It's  Climb,This is an interesting site and includes both Hindu and Buddhist artifacts.  Be prepared for a substantial climb on steps to get to the caves.  This was one of the few sites with armed military guards present.  As you climb you'll have several places where you can see all of Nashik and it is much larger than you'd think from city level. This was one of the few places that charged for entry.  Still worth it.
Amazing place,Must visit place in case you are in nasik...Its  amazing trek to the caves amidst trees & cool breeze....amazing view once you reach there...Loved the place
Heavily underrated..!!!,"This turned out to be a pleasant surprise to us. With around 24 caves, it is Ellora caves in miniature. The hike to caves is for around 10 mins and gives you a splendid view of Nashik city below."
Budhist history & Vihara on top of a Hill,Pandavleni Caves on top of a hill is a Old stone cave with Budhist statutes engraved into the rock. The unfortunate thing is though its from Archaeological Survey of India there is no Tourist Guide to talk about the place and history and what ever I could know is through Internet. Would  be  good to  carry a water bottle as  one has to climb steps before reaching the Pandavleni Caves.
Worth the trek :-),Nothing great but worth the trek. Its a 30 minute climb and gives some good views of the surroundings as you go upwards. The caves are majestic with great carvings and if you are one who likes caves and the sculptors its for you to visit for sure. Carry some water and do take breaks. Weekends are crowded
A passage to long time ago ...,The caves are worth a visit to transcend across time and travel back 2000 years and imagine what life would be then . There are ornate exteriors and inner wall carvings that evoke intrigue. The caves must have been home to a large community of ancient people who stayed and prayed in the spaces . One can oversee the Nasik city from where are caves are located.
Just an ordinary cave with a story background,If you are expecting some nice carvings or a big tunnel like cave or some ancient set up to line in cave etc. Then do not visit this. Not worth climbing all over the mountain and to be greated by 5 normal looking caves with different sizes. Although there is a story that pandavas took shelter here so different sized caves belong to each one of them. Good for a leisure visit when u wanna have some difference in the usual city attractions. Yes beware of the food snatching monkeys.
Visit to pandawlene,Visit this place .. a good exercise..Go there early in the morning..After coming down..visit the jain mandir at Vilholi..take jain breakfast.. then you have a chance to visit the sport shoppy..Decathlon
Mad crazy hike,Great for photo ops. Went there with the wife and a few friends. The walk up is a crazy one - it goes on and challenged the fitness freak in me.The view from the top is good.
Awesome place,"""Great place"". It is good 15 to 20 min walk upward but once you reach up it is awesome. Carves are in good condition. Place is well maintained (toilet, cleanliness). I would surely like to visit again to see the aerial view of Nashik city."
Trecking on sunday,"we went in a group for a treck..its really good place cave are historical..even steps are their..some peackoks,monkeys are seen..good plan treck.............."
Amazing to believe it actually existed......,"Just give in to the stories that the guide tells you.ave where Sita went into hiding, Sita was actually abducted from here, there is a temple at the very place she was taken away from, there is a Lakshman Rekha oich runs a bridge.....such an amazing feeling."
Pandavleni and Phalke Smarak,"You could take a state transport bus from Mumbai naka or dwarka circle in Nasik for this place. The caves can be reached after climbing up several steps. Wished the caves had been maintained better than they are. Also more information displayed would have also added value to the visit. A must visit place near the base of the hill is Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak. The complex contains a park, meditation spaces, a conference hall and an exhibition center."
Unmarried couples should avoid this place at all costs,"Being in Nasik for more than 35 years, we often used to visit this place.Its a beautiful monument and said to be built by the Pandavas during their exile; but this is not correct. It has nothing to do with them.Once at the top, you can view the panoramic view of Nasik city.Over the years, this place has turned more of a joggers park. In the early morning, you will find many people coming here for exercise and fitness.Unmarried couples should avoid visiting this place at all costs to avoid harassment from local police and unwanted people. Even married couples should avoid visiting this place in search of isolation & privacy. Better come with group or try to remain with a group of people.Incidents like thefts, eve teasing and rapes have been reported. Safety & security should be your top most concern."
Nice place to visit early morning for a good exercise.,I have visited this place a couple of time when I went to Nashik. Had climbed up till the top for the challenge. It's a breathtaking view from the top. Must see.
Panoramic view of the city,"Just little off the Mumbai - Nasik Highway, immediately after you cross the Octroi Post, on the left you will find these beautiful caves. Though on the outskirts of the Nasik City, you will seldom find crowd there except may be on weekends. It is really great place to visit especially during monsoon, when the surroundings have been painted green by the mother nature. You get a panoramic view of this industrial township."
Its Ecstatic!!!! Simply Ecstatic!!!,"The best time to enjoy the Pandavleni caves in early morning. Take a walk upto the caves before the sunrise and view the sunrise from the top. Sit on one of the pedestals at the entrance, take a deeeep breath, listen to the birds chirping and feel the fresh air. Its ecstatic, that's one word I have got to say about Pandavleni...."
Nice caves not many know about.,Nice caves not many know about. Kind of hidden gem. You have stairs to reach to the caves. But its still tiring. Visit in the early morning hours
Whole nasik seen from this hill top caves !! amazing !!,This one of the amazing place in nasik one should not skip during their trip to nasik.The experience of climbing the hill top where there are historical ancient caves was simply great. The view from the top is simply awesome. The whole nasik and surrounding region can be seen.The timing is till 6 pm so latest one should reach by 5 pm to explore the place without being in hurry. There's a nominal entry fee of just rs 5.Only drawback i observed is the historical place is not preserved properly. There are less safety railings. The civic body should look into it.
Into the rocks,One more adventure to feel.It is an ancient place where you can lookback into the past for History of Civilization
One of the best place to visit in nashik,This is nice place to visit . Good caves . Just note you need to walk or wouls say climb 2 km to reach the place . Avoid it during hot summer. You wont get anything at the top.
Awesme caves,previously when i was kid i prefer to to go there but as my age grow chocies were change but for family or for kids children you should visit this place of like fort type having pavitra sathan of pandav has done tap over here nice place to visit but mst u fell good in rainy
excellent creature of ancient man,i was amaze to see the technoclogy used by ancient man to bulit this caves. also attraction is falake smarak and evening light dance.
Must visit place,"The climb to this place is slightly steep. However the effort is worth it when you reach this place. The view from the top is great, so are the caves and the carvings."
"Pandavleni caves , Nashik","Pandavleni Caves are a group of twenty four, 1200 years old Hinayana Buddhist caves located about 8kms south of Nashik. Nashik is one of the world’s holiest Hindu cities. The Kumbh Mela is held here once in 12 years along with Ujjain, Allahabad and Haridwar.Leni in Marathi (the local language) means caves.Although these caves are located near one of the holiest Hindu sites and have a name of Hindu deity, these rock-cut temples initially were started by Jains and later turned into rather significant centre of Buddhism.Caves are located midway up the Trirashmi Hill, some 100 m above the surroundings, facing north-east. Climb to caves is not too hard and the atmosphere around the caves is peaceful and - how agreeable - free of annoying monkeys!Cave complex has additional amazing feature - stone-cut steps leading from the base of the hill to caves and from one cave to another. Stone steps lead also to the summit of Trivashmi Hill but this path is considered to be dangerous.Site contains also several carved water tanks and overall good water management system.The cave has idols of Buddha, Jain Teerthankara Vrishabhdeo, and the icons of Bodhisatva, Veer Manibhadraji and Ambikadevi. These caves are popular meeting places for the disciples as well. There are also attractive water tanks that are very skillfully chiseled into the rock.Nashik is well connected by road and rail with all the major places within and outside the state."
Pandavleni Caves,"Its a historic please near to nasik, must visit in nashik .Great view of nashik city from the hill. Staff at entrance is very rude .they need some training . people outside of india are coming and visits this place and these people's behavior gives vary wrong impression about India"
Heritage site with great view of nashik city,"These caves are on the hill, climb is easy. Very well carved out, each clearly showing a different function for which it was built.  The area is clean and well maintained.  The view from here is simply fantastic. You get to see the whole of Nashik city and the surrounding hills."
