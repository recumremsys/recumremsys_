Hot spring natural hot water coming from mountain amazing.,Hot spring natural hot water coming from mountain amazing. It take time to take a dip as water is so hot. It taje time to adjust with the hotness of water but it's a great place to be in and temples around it are beautiful historical.
Another top attraction,Another temple on top of a small hill.To reach there you have to ascent the hill through narrow by lanes.Though the vehicles go to top but there is a parking place about half km before the temple.The temple’s architecture is really beautiful and also not so crowded. The view from the temple is beautiful.There are two bath places for Gents & Ladies adjacent to temple. Another two small temples are also there.
Vashisht temple,This is a very ancient temple dedicated to maharishi vashisht. Roads are very narrow and traffic jam is common. There are two separate hot water ponds for men and women.
Vashist Temple,"We visited this place at the time our trip to Manali,This temple situated around Manali Town.Very good temple dedicated to Rishi Vashist.Adjacent Hot Water Pond is also good."
Local sightseeing in Manali,This place is very peaceful surrounded by snow-capped Himalaya. The tranquillity of the place attracts me more.
Vashisht Temple & Water Kund,"Visited this historical place with friends in last year. During our visit, Temple renovation work is going on. There is a natural ‘Hot Water Kund’ to bath. There is also another two-three small temple to visit. Parking is available there which is half km away from main temple."
Vashisht temple and hot springs,Temple is situated at a hill top and famous for the hot water springs. There are separate bathing places for men and women in the temple pond .Roads are very narrow and traffic jams during peak tourist season is common .
Vashisht Temple,The place is at a height and we enjoyed climbing to the same. The temple courtyard is quite big and we took pics and enjoyed for almost an hour.
Rejuvenating ,"The hot spring bath is amazingly rejuvenating. The entrance is from within the vashisht temple. The water is very hot. It's at the tipping point between comfort and burning. Try not to move a lot in the water and you'll feel really comfortable. As a bonus, the water contains more sulphur which is supposedly good for the skin.To reach there, its preferable you leave the vehicle at the bottom of the ascent to the top, it's about a 1km walk. This will help you prevent traffic jams.Might like to add that it might not be too comfortable for women - in that the women taking the bath are fully nude. Men dont have to worry as all men wear shorts or underwears."
HOT water! ,"This is an interesting temple, along with natural hot spring baths.The baths are enclosed, with separate rooms for men and women.The water is hot, HOT! I frequent hot pools regularly and found this water too hot to sit in for more than a minute or so.The baths were very busy, but still an enjoyable experience.One note - in winter, the traffic congests on the way up and down the road, and it can take up to an hour each way."
Too hot water,"I had visited this place in january but still couldn't manage to take bath in the water, it was too hot for me. Otherwise a good tourist atttaction"
Ever interesting and heritage,"I visited this Temple with two friends. Earlier, I visited with my sister. The wood work, the calm Pandit ji, the Hot Water bath, everything is mesmerizing"
A good experience,Inside temple complex of Vashisht muni. Direct hot sulphur water  from underground spring is very hot and refreshing and said to give good health benefits also. They have provided separate bathing areas for male/females and it is clean.
Okay okay place,This temple is nearby Manali and is okay place. Nearby market is something one can visit to shop local product.
Manali tour,Nice temple of prabhu Ram and vashishta.Main attraction is hot water reservoir where water is always boiling in winter season.You can have bath in this.
Hot spring,A very good temple having hot spring . This is having seperate bath facility in hot spring for gents & ladies. This temple is located at the top of the hill surrounded by Shiva and Sita Ram temples.
Dismal Condition,The pond is just okay but could be improved with a little care from local authorities so that it could be enjoyed by tourists - currently it is more of locals den.
Amazing experience..,"It's a historical Vashisht temple,which has natural sulphur hot spring baths.There's a separate facility for men n women.The water was really hot,though,must be around 40°.It's highly therapeutic and relieving. So,worth a dip.When you come out of the temple,there's an amazing Tandoor Kullad tea available,which feels awesome after a hot dip."
Vashisht Hot Springs,It was a very peaceful place. We visited twice. In the morning - it was serene and enjoyable - however in the evening - it was crowded.  Overall - worth visiting.
Small temple near a hot spring,The temple is an old wood carved one.the hot springs were a disappointment as the origin has been covered and diverted to the baths and some water outlets for locals to wash clothes etc.
Very good,The bath is very good and hot water springs are very helpful in curing many ailments.  A must place to visit
Hot water spring and temple ,Vashist has beautiful hot water sulphur spring and temple . Here people come to take therapeutic bath . It’s a must visit place
A Beautiful Small Temple with Hot Spring Near to It.,"It is an Historical Small Temple. After visiting I came to know that the appearance of Temple is changed within last few years. In all it is good place to visit with family. Just check with timings, Mandir remains close in afternoon. However this place is inconvenient for old age people as vehicles are not allowed near to temple and passengers must have to get down at least half kilometres before the temple. You can have bath in hot springs at this place."
Live music and awesome food,Must visit place. Happening beautiful interior live music and yummy food. Outside sitting is also Available.
Historical place ,Historical temple dedicated to Guru Vashisht. Sulphur springs water are said to cure many disease.  A word of caution pungent smell of sulphur may cause nausea or headache to some people.
Nice onsen in Bashisht,"Was glad to find some onsen here in India, the existence of which was a surprise to me. The facilities are very simple and austere, but since it’s free I can’t complain. Highly recommended if you’re in the area. Just be careful to reserve a return trip back to Manali if going at night by taxi or tuktuk as there are few stationed in Vashisht after 9pm or so. The road back to Manali is also precarious at the moment due to construction and walking back at night is not for the faint of heart."
Soo happy to see this and tke bath,When we rich to this place we decided to take shower. Than we went to this place and enjoy with hot bath and in this time it's very nice to take shower in vashishth bath
Bathing,Wonderful experience in this area.There are separately facility for men a d women. Hot water bath is relaxing whole body
Hot spring,Vashisht bath temple is belong to the. Ram ji and Laxman . You get a hot springs  that are to be found on the banks of the gurgling River Bras.
"Vashisht Temple and Hot Water Springs, Manali, Himachal Pradesh","Visited this famous Vashisht Temple (named after Rishi Vashisht, one of the seven Hindu sages) which is decorated with excellent and beautiful carvings on wood and is almost 3.5 km. from Manali in Feb'19. The Vashisht Hot Water Spring is one of the famous attractions of this region. The sulphurous hot springs is believed to have medicinal value and believed to cure many skin diseases. Many people go to the Vashisht baths to take a dip and rid themselves of skin infections and diseases while seeking blessing from the presiding deity of the temple. There are also separate bathrooms for both men and women, fitted with showers. The timings for Vashist Temple are 7 am to 9 pm and for baths are 7 am to 1 pm and 2 pm to 9 pm on all days. Guest houses are available for long stay (1-4 months) usually preferred by foreign tourists."
Floating particles...,"If you’re a couple, don’t plan this to be a romantic dip, men & women baths are separated. The water is pretty funky & full of floating skin? Or something that looks super gross? But the water is nice after a trek, taps to rinse off after so you can bring soap. It felt dodgy haha but relaxing & rejuvenating when my eyes were closed."
Totally Different Culture,"It is amazing there is a hot water spring in this cold freezing climate. Indian people believe that their illnesses will cure with a nude bath in this hot water pool. Two places for male and female. Some are staying in the pool for hours while some are just taking a dip. However, a different cultural thing in India."
Holy river,"Bias river runs long route comes from deep himalaya and associated with age old history. The river is scenic through all its route and gives pleasant, cool and relaxing feel all time."
Unique experience,"Its next to Vashisht and Ram Temple, just walk past the temples. The pool like area to take a dip is for males only. Was told its a unique experience, so must try but I was in a rush and not ready. Have experienced it though when I was young."
Must Visit !!,The temple is a small one with restricted entry to the main area. There is a Rama Temple just next to this. The way to go there is steep and you should park your cars in the lower area to avoid getting stuck in traffic (This is very important). From there you can walk up to the Bahs. There is a hot water spring here which you cannot miss. It is truly an experience which should not be missed.There are separate areas for Men and Women and oone should make sue that you take a dip in the hot water. Once you do you will never want to come out. It is one of the most soothing things I have ever done in my life.
Good to see,"There is a natural hot water spring where you can take bath.Not very near to Mall road, have to take auto and there is a parking space on a walkable distance if you have your own vehicle.Its deep inside the local market."
Heritage temple,The temple has the hot springs and people usually bathe before worship. You need to walk up for nearly 20 mins from the parking lott.
Needs Cleaning and proper managing,"Though a very popular site in Manali, but poorly managed and needs proper mechanism and bathing facilities. Locals use this as their daily bathing place."
guru vashisht temple,its holy place and there is hot water inside it . there was bath house for men and women separate. best part is that water which  come out is naturally boiling hot .
Try to Visit,Majority people visit to known places and skipping such temples. Will suggest to please visit as it's quite old temple but made very beautifully. There is kund here which as per localites having water works as medicine in skin allergy etc.
Temple and Hot springs - skip if visiting Manikaran,"Nice temple dedicated to Lord Vashishta, with the natural steaming hot springs nearby. You may take a holy dip in the bathing area, the water is said to be rich with many minerals and heals diseases. However, you may give it a miss if going to Manikaran.Reason1- Roads are not well maintained and narrow, we got stuck in traffic for an hour - both way.Reason2- Temple is going thru some renovation which may cause inconvenienceTo experience Hot water springs and bath, prefer Manikaran if its not in your list. If its not in the list, please add.. its worth it :)"
Visit,"Visited the temple with very high hopes, which were dashed after the visit.Seems temple was under renovation and may be alternate arrangements were made, even though alternate arrangements it left us feeling the visit to temple was ......"
natural hot springs,nice temple of vashisht with natural hot water gushing out of taps and a place to have a bath in the natural hot water
Vasistha and Lord Ram Temple,Visited on May 2019.Guru vasistha was Guru of Lord Rama and is named after him. Currently temple was under construction and idol can be seen from bit far. Hot water spring facilities are closed for Women when we visited temple.From parking we need to climb bit up to reach temple and need to climb bit more to reach hot water spring pond for men.Market is very costly when compared to Manali Mall Road
Vashisht Baths,Such a relaxation. Only grudge is there is not much cleanliness. Seeing meat shop just opposite the temple was a great shock for me.
Long walk up from the parking,"The place is known for its hot springs. Although I didn’t go in, the people with me who went in loved the hot spring. You can even have a bath in there. There are different places for women and men. And yes there are a few fools who came and washed clothes out there and were chided at! So yea good for a foot soak!"
Vashishta and Ram Temple,4 kms from Mall road and small and very old temple. Good to go by 7 in the morning to avoid traffic during the vacation. Small market and dhabas are around.
sulphur baths,vashisht baths are very soothing for a trekker after a long trek from various trekking points ion and around Manali.The hot baths provide ample relaxation to the mind as well as the body.worth a visit.Not so far from main market can easily be reached by an auto rickshaw.Highly recommend from my side.
Hot Water Spring,Vashishth Temple is the only place where you will get Hot water Spring in Manali. You can enjoy Hot Water Bath is this temple. So please carry your extra clothes and towl if you plan to take a bath. This hot water is also good to cure skin disease.
Beautiful natural formation struggling with the population,Pls. the Government should preserve this beautiful place ..by limiting the number of people. Awesome hot water bath. Cleanliness to be improved....
Spiritual,A spiritual peaceful place.Amazing hot spring water for bathing. The temple is ancient guru Vasishtha . there is another temple of Taghunathji right opposite to this .
Ultimate relaxing experience,"Although a mostly crowded place, having a hot bath in sulphur springs, especially when it’s quite cold outside, is one of the most relaxing and appealing experiences. Men and women are segregated. You need to go prepared with a towel and briefs to wear during the bath. There’s neither any arrangement to keep clothes or belongings, nor changing rooms available so you’ll need to have someone outside manage this and take turns to get into the bath. There’s some flotsam in the bath (obvious, with so many people getting in) that’s a bit disconcerting till relaxation drives everything else out of the mind. Towels are available in nearby shops if you forget to carry yours."
Review of hotel,"Best service, with excellent behaviour.You should visit here once and for sure you will visit again and again."
Nice temple,Nice temple. Like the view and hot water. Market surrounding to this temple is really good but if you are going to purchase please bargain.
Historical and mythological,This ancient temple is one of the most revered by the local. People come from far and wide to bathe in the natural hot water springs to rid of many health problems. The place is divine. The adjoining Ram Temple is beautiful as well. But must beware of the shops lining the road upto the temple selling Kashmiri Soparus. Absolute bogus that.
lovely manali,very good temple at an excellent location.warm water bath can be enjoyed here.so keep extra clothes with you
Visit for the experiance of Hot water springs in Ice cold Manali,It is an ancient temple situated near Manali. The temple is very old and nearby are the hot water spring bath. The water is quite hot and smells of Sulfer and is said to be a cure for many skin diseases.One can have a bath there. There are different chambers for ladies and gents. But we didn't feel like going into the hot water pool. For people like us they have kept 2 taps where one has the hot steamy water and another routine tap water which is ice cold.Its fun to  experience it.
HOT WATER SPRINGS ARE REALLY COOL,"Went with my family, the male members spend around 1 hour and they felt so rejuvenated after the bath. Female area- I wouldn't recommend for those who can just go nude and wash and change before every other(female)"
Ancient Temple,The temple is very ancient surrounded Shiv Temple Ram Temple and Hot water springs even though manali being very cold place with 8 degree could find little hot water.
A Hot Water Bath Pool,The place is next to the temple itself. It is a pool with hot water. An experience to go for. Take a towel & extra pair of clothes. Open to all age groups.
Old temple with natural hot water,This is very old temple with natural hot water coming from mountain naturally Please take extra cloths and undergarments and soap and shampoo when u visit this templeThere is separate bath area for ladies and gents. So this is appropriate place for ladies also take bath in hot water
amazing walk,"it's around 3.5 Kms from Mall Road. in between about 100-200 meters road was bad because of some construction work was going on... as a result there was massive traffic jam so i thought of walking upto this place... this was same road with goes to salong and rohtang pass. after walking around 2kms, a local guy told me not to take the road further instead take the steps which was the short cut to reaching the temple... it was bit tiring but scenic beauty was refreshing... the attraction of this place is hot water spring bath and obviously the nature's beauty...  took me around 5 hours to and fro ( including the time spent there)"
Pure water bath,Vashist bath on the manali foothills is one of the places to visit. Known for its pure water which direclty comes from the snow clad mountains you can have a dip and feel the freshness it has.
Vasishth temple plus Hot Water Springs,Temple is very common like other temple in manali but hot springs made it different. Many persons goes for taking bath in hot springs (Kund). It is situated in a very good market place mostly by Kashmiri people.
Must go for holy  hot water bath.,"It's located 4 km far from Manali mall road , easily accessible by road , if you are going by car or big vehicle than you have to park your vehicle half km far from temple and need to walk to reach temple. Along with you can visit Shree ram temple . it's just beside vashisht temple."
Good old temple ,Ancient temple dedicated to Rishi Vashisht. It has natural hot bath facilities - separate facilities for male and female. Welcoming behavior by local people and temple priest.
Hot water bath ,This place is actually famous for its hot water springs though we did not have a bath considering the extreme cold temperatures and it being crowded. The temple in itself is an old small temple but great surroundings and hot water springs in its vicinity. Paid parking available.
Beautiful,"I went to Vashisht Baths. While most temples will leave you spiritually rejuvenated, there are a few where you can take a dip into hot water springs and baths, which leave you refreshed and maybe even healthier. It is great place to go."
Manali Visit in January 2019,"Vashisth is nearly 3 km away from Manali Mall Road. An old Kullu architecture based temple of Rishi Vashisth was there. Natural hot springs were also there. The natural hot springs are small in comparison to Manikaran Sahib. Pool size is much less and many people are generally present in the pool at any time. Worth visiting if you had not visited Manikaran earlier or having no plan to visit there either. If you are in Manali and have sufficient time, may visit this place."
Pray & Bath in hot water,A must visit place it is. There are 2 temples next to the hot water bath pool. The walk towards the place is an upward slope with restaurants & shops to buy things.
Tandoor tea,Tried Tandoor tea near the temple. Something different to try abit expensive for rs. 50 but worth.  The temple is also good. Not to mention the hot spring in -5 ° C. was thrilling
holy bath,"Yes we go there for a Holy Deep ..BUT THE LOCALS TREAT IT AS A FREE toilet/ bath room, they come with bucket of old cloths to be washed and they bath as thou they have not bathed for weeks scrubbing each other. and we have to wait and wait untill i have to ask them when will they FINISH. I  wish the temple management will do something about it...Its a historic temple and A SAGE CALL VASHIST and this how they traet the HOLY WATER. ANYWAYS IT DOES not STOP me going as my focus was only on the divine."
Sulphur spring,"The main attraction of this place is the hot sulphur spring. You have to park the car at the parking and walk up. We walked up the winding roads to the springs. Didn't get down for bath.They have a tank in which the spring water is collected and let out through taps, for those who don't wish to go down. The view of mountains from there is beautiful."
Just another attraction to visit!!,"When you visit this place you can park your car in any of the parking lot nearby. There are paid parking lot with just 2/3minutes walk to the Baths or free parking lot 5minutes from the Baths.Even if you are parking in free parking lot it’s a busy street right up to the Baths up the hill. Souvenirs shops walled to the lane which takes you to the spot. So many jewelry shops as well if you are interested in beautiful silver jewelry. I picked a few from here and they are outstanding. There are stalls which sells food, restaurants for dine in, and also you are fond of sour stuff like raw mango, tamarind, and many other junkies that can be found here in this lane.When you get in the premises, you are supposed to remove the footwear outside and the care taker charges 2/5rupees for the same.The Vashisht Bath, a water body which is natural Sulphur spring is believed to possess medicinal values for skin related ailment. These are connected to the premises through pipes in separate section for men and for woman. The bathing area section has photography prohibited inside to respect the privacy.Its kind of a very small place for bathing but you can visit the place for its charm and dip your toes.This place is also a scenic tourist spot as it offers beautiful panorama especially sunset hour. Make a note of the opening and closing hour of this place before you plan your visit.This rating is based on overall experience here, not just the monument!!don't get disappoint by seeing the monument, enjoy the surrounding as well..."
Hot water bath,This place  is situated away from the main manali market.  This place has to by accessed by vehicle which will leave you to the parking. From there a few metres is the temple. The temple is fully made out of wood. Just adjacent to the temple is the place where the hot water springs are believed to come.  There is a bathing area of women in the temple premises.  Water for sure is hot... Outside of this temple many locals can be seen with the rabbits.  They charge you nominally for taking photo with the rabbit.
Vashisht is a sort of hippie village,"Vashisht is a sort of hippie village about two kilometres north of Manali. Here families can bathe in the hot springs and visit the numerous temples, while the foreign tourists mainly come here for the ease of finding charas. You have to climb to the top of old Manali to enjoy real old villages with wooden houses covered with slate. A temple dedicated to Manu, the first man according to Hindu legend, stands in this place"
Most of the visited place,This place is mostly visited place in Manali. There are two separate baths for men and women. There was maintenance going on at this place.

Vashisht temple is built in a traditional style with lots of intricate wood carvings. It is also most popular for hot sulphur springs which are believed to have medicinal value.

Sulfur hot spring,"This place is beyond temple. Being a researcher this place attracted me more than any other place at Manali. Famous for its hot water spring, this place is known to cure skin disease which in not magic but science. Infact yes, dip in the hot water spring contain sulfur which can ease some skin problems. There are separate sections for men and women and you can dip yourself freely in respective section. The temple is made of carved woods which is also very fascinating."
It is an interesting place where hotwater springs are diverted into seperate baths for men and women,"very rustic and charming hill top temple. A small walk to the temple may be requried. three temples, one each of Shiva, Ram and Vashist are there. At the Vashist Temple, you will find two bathing places flowing with hot water of right temperature. I visited, but did not take bath."
"Small temple , Good architecture , unhygienic hot water bath","The Vashisht village is 6 km from Manali at the banks of the Beas River opposite Old Manali. Vashisht is reachable from Manali by half an hour walk or a short drive up a slanting road.The Vashisht temple which exists even today is believed to be more than 4000 years.Vashisht temple is built in a traditional style with lots of intricate wood carvings. It is also most popular for hot springs which is believed to have medicinal value. There are separate bathing arrangement for men and women.But the water is very unhygienic. It's a matter of faith & curiosity to check out hot water bath /spring that bring people to this place. Lot of foreigners are staying in the vicinity for long duration.I could see signs on restaurants offering Israeli & Italian cuisine to cater to this crowd.overall, go if you must."
The architecture is good but the hot spring is unhygene,The temple is good for photo and it's presence. The floors are really cold and chilly and nice. But the hot springs are very unhygienic. Lots of people dip in the hot water in a really small place!
Unhygienic and Congested,In a chilly evening when you are shivering with cold.  You see so many people taking a dip in this hot spring. And you feel why are they doing such a thing?  Surely it's faith that make them do such things.The sight of so many people bathing together in such a small place is surely not good. And i was told there are no proper arrangements to change after the dip. The authorities have  put a few taps where the hot water keeps flowing and the local use it for their daily chores such as washing clothes and utensils. And yes the water is very hot if you touch it in one of those ever flowing taps.
Needs basic hygiene to be maintained in hot water spring,I agree that this is a beautiful place at the foot hills of Rohtang and hot natural water in extreme weather conditions is soothing. I do not have any negative remarks against this place but the tourists who are exploiting this spring water. People need to understand personal hygiene and should not have bath here with their clothes off. There are kids around along with adults. The toilets are dirty. I was not very happy visiting this place.
Hot spring bath,Hot spring bath.. its a must visit place. It's been said any kind of skin or body problem can resolved. They have Turkish hamam style bath. when we visit there were none so we enjoyed for long.
A must visit,Hot springs and the ancient history of the place makes it a must visit place. Cars can go till the top.5mins walk is all you'll have to do. It's quite a small place. Max of 30mins is all you'll need here.

unique,its a cool old Hindu temple. the best part is its hot water spring bath. u can take bath here and feel fresh. its like 30 mins drive from the city and 15 mins walk from the parking place. the village is cool too with many food places and shops.
Healing natural hot spring-temple bath,"Very popular with the locals and busy in evenings after their day’s work, yet I still found the soaking experience quite pleasant and relaxing though it was usually a bit crowded when I went in the evenings. Water is probably cleaner early mornings, and is sometimes a wee hot. Nice experience to visit the local temple for a healing bath."
Magical Hot Springs,Words are not enough to describe my experience about hot spring bath at Vashisht.... I am already looking forward to my next trip to Manali... especially for hot spring bath..... How i wish i lived somewhere closer so that i could take a dip everyday at mighty Vashisht hot spring.... I was so much moved by this place that i ended up writing a blog on Hot spring bath at Vashisht... Highly recommended...
Take a dip an experience a hot bath to relax and warm your body...,"Not to be missed is the town's hot sulphur spring, where the water temperature is variable from day to day, from warm, hot, very hot or boiling hot. Believed to have medicinal value it is beneficial for hair and skin too. It's useful to bring your shampoo and plastic jug. A relaxing 15-20mn daily bath during my long stay at Vashisht. Free entrance."
Sujan Cafe at Vashisht ,"It's great to visit the Vashisht Temple and experience the natural hot water baths...Must visit for every traveler to Manali.. After a relaxing bath at the hot water bath, head to this little unassuming 'Sujan Cafe',  just 10 metres from the Vashisht Baths for some freshly made piping hot momos, chowmein, tea or pakodas. Definitely try their 'Spinach and Cheese Momos' and 'Onion Spinach Pakodas'.. They're too yummy as the owner Mr. Himanshu and his Chef, Champa (seen in pic) make it with fresh ingredients grown in their backyard and a lot of passion thus churning delicious mouth licking dishes for any palate. A must visit for a foodie / visitor to Vashisht."
Be aware of fraud Sparu ( Chingu) blanket ,"The multi-crore market of chingu, a blanket which Kashmiri shopkeepers claim to be made of feathers of a rare animal,""No such animal exist, is making hundreds of tourists the victim of fraud daily. Having no fear of the police, Kashmiri shopkeepers have spread their network in Vashisht, old Manali, Dhungari and Manali.Don’t buy any kind of blanket in Manali n it’s not from Kashmiri n the original price of blanket is ₹750 max and we did lot of negotiations they are ready to give for but we didn’t not took.Don’t buy Kesar in road side it’s not kesar If you visit there try to negotiate n they may sale for ₹50/ pcs seriously we did n but we didn’t purchase. They ready sell kesar for ₹50 / small box"
One time visit,"Just one time visit, the temple is under construction so you don't get to enter it also you have to park your car HALF A KILOMETRE AWAY and walk through a steep mountain which is very tiring specially when you have kids to carry"

The place is situated 6 km away from Manali & is on the way to Solang. One can hire an auto or taxi & can also cover it during local sightseeing around Manali or while returning from Solang valley.These are natural sulphur Springs, which are said to possess medicinal values that cure several skin diseases. They are connected to the Turkish style showers through pipes. One can visit the baths to revitalize their body and soul. You can take a dip into hot water springs and baths, which leave you refreshed and maybe even healthier. This area is surrounded by hundreds of small shops from where you can buy souvenirs and religious merchandise."
Valley of God,"Vashisht Baths are hot water springs, situated at village- bashisht, on the banks of the gurgling Beas River in the picturesque hill station of Manali,Himachal Pardesh. These baths are named after the great sage Vashisht, who was a teacher and adviser to Lord Rama. Surrounded by pine trees and luxuriant vegetation, these water bodies are natural sulphur springs, which are believed to possess medicinal values and can cure several skin related ailments. Elegant Turkish style showers, which are connected to the springs through pipes, are fitted here for the convenience of visitors. While on a Manali tour, soak yourself in Vashisht Baths to revitalise your body and soul."
Slightly overrated ,Hot pond is a bit smelly and area outside it is a bit unclean - authorities should look at upkeep of such a historical place
Hot spring,"Hot water bath is the attraction in manali. There are 2,3 hot water springs it seems but we went to vasisht bath only. hot water always flushing to the tanks is different experience"
Nature Gift,Second day of our Manali stay we had visited this place.. This is hot water bath place.. for man and woman separate bathroom.. This is good for our skin.. Natural beauty surrounding this template attracted to us..Be ware with local Saparu blanket seller..
Awesome experience,"It's beautiful waterfall and a must visit. I love visiting waterfalls. There was a small restraunt on the way, serving delicious thukpa. Must visit"
Take a deep Dip......,Take sometime and spend in the bath......its magical water full of medicinal properties.....We went there in hurry thinking there wont be much but as we entered the water felt like all our tiredness was gone.A must visit .... pls. take your time and pay visit.
Poorly maintained,"The temple was under renovation. The hot water spring was really hot that u cant take a direct bath in it. But the bath areas are very poorly maintained. Stingy and smelly. When we went there with kids, we cud spot a few ladies, taking bath almost nude. Though the bath area is covered, such kind of gestures are hard to accept."
MEDICINAL,VASHISHTA ASHRAMA is the place where sage VASISTA  lived.This temple has a BEAUTIFUL wooden image of SAGE VASISTA and there are HOT WATER KUNDS (bath ) here and they have medicinal value.
"Crowded place, nothing special","It was a crowded place, having a lot of associated history.There was nothing more special. Can do this attraction in an hour or so max. Note that to reach the temple area, there is significant slope to climb from the parking area."
small place with history,"This is a old vasishth temple and water, Now a days renovation is going on. Need to walk to reach there as its on heights. good place"
"Worth visiting, although a bit congested","I visited the place in the first week of June, with my family. There are two temples namely Vashisth temple and Ram temple. Presently, renovation is going on at Vashisth temple, hence you have the view of the Idol from a distance. However, the architecture of both the temples are very attractive with background of mountain view.The approach road and the surroundings of the temple is congested but so is  majority of the temples during peak tourist season.There is a place at the entry of Vashishth Temple where you can leave your shoes and roam around the temples and take a bath at hot water 'Kund'. Two separate ' Kunds' are available for Ladies and Gents. Ladies 'Kund' is cramped due to confined spaves, however gents 'Kund' is perfect to take a bath. But, you can not immidiately take a dip into the 'kund' because of the high temperature of water, one has to adjust with it gradually.  Another method can be adopted to get into the water from the side where cold water is being mixed or using a mug to mix hot and cold water and pour over head.Overall a must visit for people visiting Manali."
"The walk to the place, or the walk from the place is a beautiful one, with the view of mountains and Beas throughout.","The temple is beautiful, a fine example of wooden architecture. The warm bath makes for a perfect place to start your day.  There was no proper place to keep my camera and stuff when going for the bat, so you need to take care of that. I walked back from the temple and it was one of the best things I did in Manali. The stretch is not crowded, and it has the view of Beas on it's right."
Vashisht Temple Ram Temple Shiva temple and Hot springs,"Vashisht is a very small village located at about 4 Kms from Manali across the River Beas. This village is very famous for its sulphurous Hot Springs and Vashisht Temple. The Hot springs water is believed to cure skin diseases and infections. Vashisht was named after Rishi Vashisht one of the seven sages of Hindu. There are separate bathing arrangements both for men and women. It is said that bathing place for women is not clean. Apart from Vashisht Temple, there are temples of Lord Ram and Lord Shiva. At present renovation is going on at this temple and donations are being accepted.There are lot of shops in Vashisht selling woollen clothes and Toy items.Vashisht Temple at Vashisht is a must to see at Manali."
An Ancient Temple,One needs to walk a few hundred meters of gentle slope from the common parking area with shops on either side of the road!The temple was under renovation and we could only see the Vashist idol from a distance.Hot water spring is inside the women bathroom and I could not see the spring.We could offer prayers at the adjacent ancient Ram Temple.
Vashisht Baths.,"This is just one of the many attractions in the busy alpine village of Vashisht, a steep mountain climb from new Manali by taxi, tuk tuk or even walking if you are feeling that energetic.  The village is full of shops and bazaars, but prices are somwhat higher than those found in New Manali, down in the valley below."
Ancient temple from the Ramayana times with Hot water spring,"The Vashisht temple and bath is located at a distance of about 3 kms from Manali. There are 3 temples in total. Apart from Vashisht temple there is a temple dedicated to Lord Ram and the other one is of Lord Shiva. Once upon a time this was place for meditation of Vashishta Maharshi. When Laxman came to take help of Vashishta muni for Ashwa megha yaga, he fired an arrow to the ground from where hot water spring gushed out to warm up the cold place. Till now there is a belief that the water here is having medicinal values. That is true beacuse of the Sulphur content.Separate enclosed bathing provision for women is available."
Best place to hangout with beautiful scenery...,"Manali is one of the best places I've been. Meet with some awesome people there, if ur couples try to use bikes coz there are so many cars around n it jams d road. Also one thing if u wanna buy leather jacket contact 9816166160 this guy has genuine leather jackets in front of Buddhist monastery. In other shops I'll get a fake jacket for 600rs...For bikes contact (scooter rentals manali- 9816076854) best bikes well maintained avg is good.... Watch out for ""sparu scam"" near jogini waterfalls area market place."
Beware of frauds!!,"Nice calm atmosphere in the temple..... Although under construction, yet provides peace of mind.....Hot water bath is also available for tired tourists. Overall the temple premises are good.However the main show starts outside. NEVER EVER think of even buying anything from the market shops, especially the handloom houses all around. They will tell you a very beautifully organised realistic tale and befool you into buying their product. But never trust those words. We have been a prey of their SCAM and we completely understand how it works. They will tell you a story about some species called CHINGU or CHEERU or SPARU(all same...... In real it never exists😂😂)from which they make blankets that KEEP U COOL IN SUMMER AND VICE VERSA. They provide you with many gift blankets as well and tell you that they will allow us to hire the main item(blanket) for 21 months to 5 years and after which someone will come and take back that blanket and return some 90% of the money we pay, but we will be allowed to keep the gifts that was provided alongside. All these stuff seem to attract the visitors who fall into the trap and later all those words only prove a lie😂🤣. You will find a lot in the internet about this CHINGU SCAM. My strong suggestion..... Please please never ever fall into the scam and be cautious as they r too clever to wind about the customer with their lies."
Not maintained,"There are two temples at the end of narrow street where you have to climb the slope. The vashisht temple is right now under maintainance. The baths made for men and women are in pathetic condition. Couldn't even think of touching the water. As a tourist, this place is just waste of time and energy. The scenic beauty surrounding is very nice...but when in manali you can experience this from everywhere hence can skip this point. The shops celling sparoo (woolen blanket) which they claim is from ladakh are also not genuine."
Waste of time,The way that leads to this Vashisht village is horrible. The hot springs or hot tub is of no use.Its not well maintained and pathetic.We just went and touched the water to feel the heat and came back.
Vashisht Temple,"Ancient time temple with natural hot water bath at cold place, shows the power of nature. Was good experience there"
Don't waste your time here,Nothing more than a waste of time and energy. Plan to go here only if you have nothing else to do on your trip to Manali and have excess energy to spend on climbing the slope through the narrow market lane.This place features in all travel guides and tour itineraries provided by tour operators as it gives them an additional point to quote in the plan. You can safely skip this place without regrets.
Waste of time. ,Visiting Vashisht kund is pure waste of time. Nothing special over here. Currently the kund is under repairs and hence entry isn't allowed. Yet there are no such signboards displayed at the drop off point for taxis. There is a steep incline narrow road to be taken to reach the top only to be left totally dissatisfied and let down. Can avoid totally.
Nothing extra ordinary,just a basic temple with a pond having natural hot water. can u good for one time visit. nothing special
Great past but poor present,This place has great past history but lack of governments interest place very dirty not clean. It can attract more tourists if it’s well maintained
Temple was blocked for renovation in april,"1. Vehicles can go right upto the temple parking but taxi drivers prefer to drop you at the base and make you want.2. Avoid the ""chingu"" or ""sparoo"" agents who spring out of shops enroute the temple. It seems that this is a scam in these parts and it's just a waste of time.3. The couple of temples up there on the hills are worth the effort no doubt as there is nothing else to do at Manali after you have enjoyed the snow and the views"
For the faithful and the unfaithful..,"This place caters equally to the faithful, with its beautiful temples and hot water baths as well as the unfaithful with its scenic beauty and shopping centre."
Bevare of frauds (sparu animal blanket),"First off all there is no animal named sparu,and sellers from Kashmir will tell you it is a rare animal and you are extracting wool from it and recycling it, actually the gorvernment has banned the sale of this but they still sell this tell it is have a government scheme and you will 75 % when you return it,one big scam.i have ordered it for 2000 as adavance and left 5000 on arrival but it hasn't arrived yet it's been 4 monts and non of the contact number on their card is correct,their shop name is shivam haldoom house.the price range from 8000-60000 many innocent tourists are fooled everyday still government is not taking any step, I have their bill and the sellers photos."
great experience.,great experience at the hot water spring here in vashisht. easily. went there by own vehicle. parking is very difficult to find. so preferably take a walk.
Beautiful place,"Around 3KM from city is a temple of Rishi Vashisht, auto will take around INR 200/- from mall road. The route is steep. Separate baths are there for Ladies and Gentlemen. Ladies bath is in the temple premises, but gents bath is around 10-15 feet away from the temple. Well maintained."
Amazing hot water spring,"was awesome to visit hot water spring and to have a bath ,well seight seen waterfall few min distance from vashisht"
"""Must have""Dont underestimate the power of this place","simply go and take Hot water bhath...a great experience...water is hot and there is provision of cold water also,place is good having taps also and a large pool to take bath..i suggest u to dont miss ."
Rama temple ,Vashisth baths have hot springs where they made separate place for ladies to take bath. Not so clean place for men to have bath. People wash clothes which they not supposed to do. There is one Rama & shiva temple near to this place.
Sping water ,"It’s very beautiful magical place with open people, great spa witch makes skin like silk and gives good energy"
Hot Springs and Temples,if you are in mood to visit temple and see the hot springs you can visit here. Hot spring baths will be crowded and doesnt seem to be managed well.
"Hot water spring , wooden temple .","Hot water spring..Wooden carving temple..Very nice temple ..Requires 45 minutes,,Nice  very testi “panipuri “ on road,,Nice hotel for pizza and tea ,,"
Pious bath,"This is a wonderful pious bath in a natural hot water pond. The water is warm throughout and also contains sulphur. Healing touch.Though it was rainy and cold weather during our stay in Manali, I and my son made the most of it by taking a dip in the hot water. The temples around are also beautiful."
Beautiful view and Hot springs,The Hot springs near the temple have extremely hot water and are very pleasant to be in chilly weather. Its a nature's miracle and you must experience it once in a lifetime
Soothing experience,"Blissful place and great to witness the hot water spring at such a place where things get frozen. The place was maintained neatly. Pathway to reach the place is a bit narrow for vehicle to go but once reach the place, would love the ambience. The Ram temple nearby was also a charm."
Good place,Good place and nice market around. there is a sulfur water source as well where you can take a dip as well..
Serene and blissful,Interesting place to observe nature/god creation of hot water spring in a cold place like Manali. No doubt Vasisth Maharishi choose this place for tapas..such a serene and blissful place.
Rishi Vashisht Temple with Hot bath,vashisht temple and bath is situated just out side the Manali mall road on a hill top . Its a very Old Wooden temple of great religious value . We paid our worship and explore the area . Since it was very cold we skipped the idea of taking bath in Hot Spring . Separate area of bath for ladies and gents . Out side the vashisit Temple you also have Ram mandir and mahadev mandir . Its a good market area to explore local handicraft and cloths . Kids can take picture with Rabbit and Sheep which is really liked by the kids .There is a parking area so you have to walk less than 100 m to the temple .
Holy temple,Very old temple situated at manali . Have a nice market for shopping .Better option other than mal road
Amazing,"The temple is located a walking distance from the bus stand. Even though the place is a bit crowded the Temple is worth visiting. And do remember you don't usually see this kind of place everywhere. And for your information, Photography is prohibited inside the bathhouse, so please do abide the rules. I must say this is one of the must place you must visit in Manali."
Relaxing environment,Super place to visit if u go there take bath and enjoy ... Go to Temple as well and take blessings of god vashisht ..

Vashisht temple,"I visited this place while doing local sight seeing in Manali. This is an old 'Vashisht Muni' temple. Adjacent to the temple is a warm water pool. There separate sections for male and female. Be prepared, if you want to take a dip in this warm (slightly hot) water pool."

Good ,"This place is approx 20 min drive from the city center . It has a small pond type pool where the hot spring is let out by two ways . One by the water connection from the top and one from the natural spring . The water was quite hot but by the time you get into the pool , you can feel the body adjust with the temperature.

Place of hot water spring,Place has hot water springs. A walk of around 400 meter on the slope is reqiuired from the parking. Shops around will ask you to visit for supru but dont fall for it
Too crowded and quite a walk,"During our visit, the place was quite crowded and the waters were literally being over-used. You'll need a walk uphill for around 200 meters as cars are not allowed beyond a certain point"
Vashisht Temple ,Rushi vashisht who have also written about goddess durga. The temple represents culture of North himachal and hot spring /water are evident enough to discribe the importance of the place as it is not seen everywhere
Very hot,It was very good expeirence to have a bath in vashisht baths and the water was very very hot and it took me 30 min to get inside.Lovely trip to vashisht bath. We took a tuk-tuk from manali mall road to vashisht bath and back by walk.Lovely tripHappy journey to all!!
Vashisht Temple & Hot Spring,The temple is around 3-4 km from Manali market. The road is narrow & we had tough time with our scooty as there is steep slopes on the way.We didn't knew that there is hot spring inside separate for Men & Women as well open to all visitors. We were not prepared hence didn't get chance.There are few more temples in surround Ram Temple just opposite to this one.

Miracles! !!,Hot water was coming from the underground while the external temperature was zero degree Celsius.  It was really a miracle for us.
Peace of mind with warm water bath,Very peaceful and blissful place. There was some secret warm water source. People were taking a bath near temple.
Hot water spring - good to see but difficult to bathe in,"Approach is not easy. There are two parkings - one close to the temple and spring and the other far away. If you get the far away parking, be ready for a steep climb. Though not very tiring - it can be cumbersome with young kids. The spring itself is interesting enough, but there is usually a number of people trying to bathe and that makes it feel a little unclean and unhygienic to use..."
Something good for your eyes and heart,"Something good for your eyes and heart, something you cannot find in city jungles, it was a great time with friends , something historic and ancient, memories of a beautiful world, it’s not somewhere from out of the world , but you’ll have that satisfaction feel."

Hot sulphur bath,"Within the Vishnu temple complex is this hot sulphur bath. Most people just sit on the edge of the bath and dangle their feet in the water, but if you want you can completely submerge. There is a seperate men's and ladies bath. Just above these baths is another temple, forgotten whether it was Rama or Shiva!!Well worth a visit"
Perennial hot water from mother nature,Vashisth hot water baths are adjacent to the ancient Vashisth temple on a hillock close to Manali town. Approach is through narrow roads with steep climb which is congested with people and vehicles. It is miracle how people access this wonderful place. Separate enclosures for bath is maintained for men and women. Water is very hot and considered to be medicinal. Lot S of people take dip in the hotel ponds here.
Not a must visit,Can do this with Jogini falls. Old temple. The attraction here is the hot water springs. But found the bathing place very smelly. Water actually was coming thru a pipe. Wonder where the springs actually are.
Vashisht(holy place of Maharishi Vashisht ),I visited there in the month of jan this year .i was amazed to see the snow everywhere as there was a huge snowfall those days.and then from the shivering winter outside one goes to take bath in the holy hot water spring of vashishta.It is said that this water has the healing powers and even it gives a relaxation .it feels like we are getting enery by taking bath .Then we come to temple to take blessings of maharishi vashishata.Awesome experience

Manali with friends,Old heritage of India. Temple of great Vashist Muni with a hot water pond next to it. In addition to those you can have a nice view of mountain filled with snow on top
Divinity in Manali,"One of the popular temples in Manali, it was relatively a small (if you feel compelled to compare with temples of grandeur) but beautiful temple thronged by tourists and visitors. One of the specialties here is the natural hot springs inside the temple premises which have been converted into hot baths for men & women separately.If you visit Manali, do visit this temple too."
A vintage temple and baths,"The temple offers a typical hill architecture, and worth seeing. The baths are public and only if you are a hot spring bath enthusiast. I am not. But since this is the starting point of the route to Jogini Falls, its an auto stop."
Vashisth Hot Baths ,One of the oldest temple located in the city. Here you can find more Israeli tourists and most restaurants serving Israeli dishes.
Histirical Temple,one of the must while you are on local city tour. Vashist Guru was the first Guru of Lord Ram. he was part of Darbar of Dashrath. the said place is where Vashisht Rishi meditated and reached self enlightenment. It also has hot water spring where Devotes take bath. Next door is the Lord Ram Temple.
Ancient temple and natural hot bath ,Its amazing to see how nature can pro ide almost boiling water at an area which is covered with snow most of the year. Its a great place to relax with separate baths for men and women. Women who may find seeing other women topless as offensive can avoid the bath.
Divya Prakash,"Vasist temple has a pond which where hot water comes from mountains and it is said that it cures illness, it is very old temple relates to Mahabharata time."
nice place for the hot springs,nice place to have a bath in natural hot springs.neat and clean.seperate bath for men and women.very neat and not too crowded unlike manikaran.
Natural Baths,Very well located..It is must visit place at manali..approach may be a problem...Old person can avoid..
A historical place,Vashisht baths is a very good place but to b honest i heard of it for the first time only when i visited here...It is a very good historical place to see in the heart of mountains all around...
Very Clean and well maintained Temple,"Beautiful temple,and a lot of restaurants and too many shops for shopping.I think two or three temples are around this place.There you can see all the wooden carvings and very interesting things around the temple."
Just alright,"They have two small temples, and there is a hot water spring. Besides this, there is nothing much to see or experience. Not sure about peak season, but not worth unless you really want to take a hot water batch here."
Take a Bath in the hot spring water,Set in the city is this old and well maintained bath with hot spring.  I was here in August and the water was too hot for me!  I did put my feet under the running water and splashed my body.  Sitting bare breasted in the open sun felt wonderful and it didn't take long to dry.  The temple is interesting with a statue that is believed to be thousand years old or more.  Be aware the temple closes for some time in the afternoon.
Well maintained,Temple is very small but well maintained . Hot spring baths place was much cleaner than Manikaran hot spring baths.
Sulphur water for your skin and bone treatment  ,Vashist is a very beautiful village several restaurants and many chingoo shops by Kashmiris. Temples are very attractive and special. From vashist village amazing Jogni waterfall is just 45 minutes to a hour only. It's a very interesting village combination of east and west. Once must visit.
Rishi Vashishth,The temple is dedicated to Rishi Vashishth (maybe one of its kind). Its a small temple with wooden carvings and traditional architecture. There are hot water springs to have a bath. Worth a visit.
HOT WATER SPRING,Temple is a beautiful and rather rustic place. Hot water pond is the major attraction in the temple compound. Nearby there are other two temples - Lord Shiva and Lord Rama. Place is commercialized with local merchandise. Must go place.
Amazing!,We went to Vashisth Temple in April 2017. It is an ancient temple - one of its own kind. Hot water pond is the major attraction in the temple compound. Nearby there are other two temples - Lord Shiva and Lord Rama. Place is commercialized with local merchandise. But still a must go place.
Hot water springs.. Sulphur Baths..,"Vashist has temples with hot water springs. People take baths before entering the temple. There is separate section for men and women. Religious place and can spend around half hour not more. The temples are old are the architecture is good. There are lot of shops outside the temple where you can quickly do shopping. There are ladies with Rabbits outside temple, you can click photos with then for 20 rupees. Overall not so great place!"
Temple of Rama's Guru,Vashisht temple is a beautiful and rather rustic place. The temple of Vashisht here build around the hot water spring is obvioudly quite old. It has been beautifully renovated with detailed and striking carved wood - Devdar (the local species of Cedar).Worth a visit as it is a short drive away from Manali city.
Hot spring in Manali,This place has a hot spring to take a holy dip and few old temples in the surrounding. You can visit here and then take a walk till the Jogini Falls
Extremely crowded,"Hot springs are supposed to be good for your skin due to their medicinal properties as they are mineral enriched. Here in the Vasishta Temple complex, the hot spring water is diverted in to small public bath areas separate for men and women. The women one has a series of taps where you can bath and a small cemented pool where you can take a dip. But the place is not particularly hygienic and the spring water used does not seem very clean due to its storage condition. Also the area around the bath is very cramped, small and slippery if you are trying to walk around it.It is also very crowded and so early mornings or late evenings are the best times to come here if you intend to bath. Also bring in a change of clothes. It is at a distance of about 5Kms uphill from the Manali Mall and so it is best to use an auto or taxi to come here. Visit the temple complex next to the bath and enjoy a small meal or snack around the area once you are done with the bath."
ancient place love to go,the hot water nullah where u can bath & feel relax. remind you of Ramayana story of Guru Vashisht. nice place
Holy Hot Water,Wonderful and relaxing bath ...We enjoyed lot ....Spring is pleasantly hot in accordance to the cold weather. Remember to take changing clothes with you...
heritage value,"nothing much to do here , it has its religious and heritage value but as a tourist its just  ok ok place"
Overrated,Everyone says when you visit Manali you need to visit the Vashisht Baths. They're just man made thermal baths and due to religion men & women can't bath in the same bath. Not ideal when there's one girl in the group!! Better things to see in Manali!!
Hot water springs,It is an holy place. I with my family visited here in June 2016. The speciality of this place is the hot water bath. The hot water is coming from top of the hill and get collected in a small tank. The water is very hot and it has some ancient and magical power to cure skin diseases. Every visitor should take the bath and also visit Lord Rama Temple which is very much near to Vashisht Temple.
Much hyped!,"I visited Vashisht on my way to Jogini Falls trek. I found it to be a really crowded and hyped place. Because it is very popular and recommended by local guides, people make it a point to go there and as a result it is really crowded. More than its limited space can sustain or entertain. Also, it is nothing more than a regular Hindu temple built in a different way. So, I will not recommend it to anyone, atleast not to anyone visiting Manali for peace and quiet."
Not Well Kept,"An old temple with a modern structure that mars its beauty. There are two separate enclosures, one each for men and women in the hot spring baths. Enthusiasts love it but the place is crowded and not well kept."
An experience one should try to feel the local vibe,Thor hot baths can offer you in the morning or evening hours An experience one should try to feel the local vibe!
enjoyed and photoshot a lot,me and my friends went in the month of April 2016 and it was awesome experience visiting Vashisht bath it just 6.5km from mall road to reach one can experience hot water spring down there later on after reaching there we have enlightened why the name of this place called so ...so we heard that this place is dedicated to guru vashisht who is considered to be most respectful guru in India.
Visit for Vashsisht Baths,"Nothing great . No arrangements exist for taking bath in a decent way.One can visit these after having travelled to Manali, but unfortunately, these are not maintained at all.  Wish the Government H.P. could pay a little attention to develop these  as nice religious tourism places."
 Not maintained well,"Temple is very small,  and the bath area is not maintained well.  No place to change,  and women are using soap in the baths.   It is also slippery.  Only reason to visit is the trek to jogini falls, which are spectacular."
One of the must visit in Manali ,"This place is on top of a small hill in Manali. The speciality of this place is the hot water bath. There will be hot water coming from top of the hill and get collected in  a small tank. The water is soo hot that  people will have to  think twice to jump in to it.The bath tank are separate for ladies and gents. Just next to the tank, there is a vashisht temple."
Enjoy hot springs,Another big attraction in Manali where you can enjoy hot springs (sulphur water) which some say has healing power to cure skin diseases.
Holy bath!!!!,A very nice kund of hot water. We had a very holy bath and it was nice feeling to had a bath in this kund.
Hot springs & temple complex,The temple complex and hot springs are an attraction here - some nice woodwork on the temples . Do not miss the ram temple located a few steps above.
MUST VISIT,"Taking bath in hot suphur water was an amazing experience. every visitor must take bath, but ensure to take clothes along with them for changing."
Hot water spring,It was a different experience to take a early morning dip in Vashisth hot water spring. The water is really very hot and feels very comfortable to take a dip specially in early hours. It's a must visit place while in Manali.
A definite must go,A quaint construction after a steep walk. The location is absolutely stunning so a definite must-go if you are in Manali and don't mind driving around to explore a few more places.
A very hot spring,Nice place to take bath here. Spring is pleasantly hot in accordance to the cold weather. Remember to take a towel with you. The temple is just beside the spring.
hot water bath in cold weather,"this is my second hot water spring experience. there is a small pool just by the temple, and another one just 15-20 m above. since the pool by the temple is always crowded, i would recommend everyone to visit the one above, which is mostly empty. its one the most refreshing experiences i have ever had."
Awesome backdrop. Interesting market around. Not so enticing when it comes to bath.,"The most notable thing about this attraction, is the breath taking view around. The backdrop of tall white mountains is just like a world that we can only dream of. There is a market around which is interesting too. The temple as such has a lot of history. But for a casual traveler, its just an old wooden temple. The most famous thing about this temple, is it's hot water bath. Now don't rush to get you towel and swimming trunks . It's a  small tank big enough to fit 3-4 people. The water temperature is warm. Not hot. I didn't like the sight of myself bathing in that small tank with 2-3 people already floating around. So I skipped it. If you feel like it, do take a dip. In all, this point is just OK to visit. Nothing too wow about it. I do give my word. The journey is worth your time. Can't say the same about the temple . You can decide yourself. Thanks."
Hot spring!!!,"A must visit place. A holy place (kind of a hot spring), u can take a dip in it. Wprth a visit. the way to the place is lined with local market, worthy of window shoping."
Nice Temple having warm water falls.,Very nice to see this old historical place and have a blessing of Vashisht Maharshi.  There is one Ram Mandir besides this temple which is pleasant to stay for a while.
Excellent,"The highlight of this temple is the antiquity of the idol of sage Vasisht which is set to be thousands of years old. There is a big hoarding which gives the history of this place, but sadly it is only in Hindi which is a big negative for those who do not know the language. Don't miss the hot water spring nearby. A dip in this is said to cure skin problems."
Very Relaxing,"Visited mid june, the water temp was slightly on higher side but worth... reached after a long trek of almost 10 kms... so was tired... didnt take a bath but dipped my legs for 5-7 mins and it worked just enough to help me relax... nice place overall.."
Natural hot water springs,"I had gone in June end of the month. Already weather is hot this time. So no need to take bath in hot water. But in normal or cold season, it's natural gift. We touched water, it was really hot. Temple place and structure also look good. In ladies section, they made a pond like place where ladies take bath."
Holy temple with hot spring water,"Its a holy space where you will find hot water and it is said that if you take a bath with this water you will never face any skin problem in your life time, though I am a different kind of guy who does not believe in all this but I have read it on many sites.Rest its just an temple while visiting here you will find my local shops in between, you can purchase hand made wollen clothes those are little bit costly."
Natural hot water in cold climate,I visited this place with my family in month of June still in this month water in tap and river was chilling but at vashisht we get natural hot water which is really amazing. People take bath in hot water . There is different facility for gents and ladies. Also temple is nice and worth visiting.
Hot Bath,Natural Hot water Stream Flowing to a place where we can take bath. Many foreigners were having a bath in this Place. Very amazing and surprise to get a hot water spring from a very cold place like this.

Good place to visit,Nice place to visit in manali.One should not miss it.Is is only 3KM away from manali & hot watter baths are available for holly dipp
Naturally Hot water all the time at this Chilled Place,Wow.... Here you find Naturally hot water all the time at this chilled Place. Do not forget to take a separate set of clothes when you visit there. You will love to have a bath there. MOST IMPORTANT: Separate Place is there for bath for Males and Females. PEOPLE SAY: Some people say that your skin problem may vanish after having a few dips there in that HOT water. (I am not sure of this).But You should visit this place for sure. And don't be in a hurry.
Not maintained,"we visited the place to have a bath in hot water spring. the pond is not maintained properly, the water is not clean"
Beautiful hot spring,"Vashisht is comparatively less crowded and this is a must visit place in manali. 3.5km form main manali is this beautiful vashisht temple with hot spring (very hot actually), but after a long walk or tiring journey, one should take bath and see the effect. Its very very relaxing. Separate section for ladies and gents. Must must visit. Try local german bakery nearby.Note: Hire local auto from new manali to vashisht hot spring (local-10 rs/pp). Outsiders (20-25 Rs./pp) depending on season."
"Very hot water, a nice place to visit",The place is in vashisht and it is very comfortable when living next by. But also nice for just visit. The hot bath is next to the tample and also gives a local expirence of sharing the water with people.The water is very hot.
Hot water springs,Natural hot water springs believed to have strong medicinal powers. The baths are situated in Vashisht temple. It's a nice experience... try for once if you have some spare time!
Mandir have Historical great value,"This place is Holy ,go early morning otherwise stuck in traffic. Don't forget to bath in Hot water kund."
Hot water,There are two trek starting from here one to Jogni water fall and other is to bhrigu lake.There are two different places to take bath but the water is extremely hot but relaxing if you take bath returning from the trek.
spiritual place,"as the name suggests this place is famous for hot water springs wherein you can take a bath. there are different areas for men and women. the hot spring is surrounded by three iconic temples and each one of them is a piece of art. you can get a spectacular view of the snow covered mountains from this place even during the summer days. however the road leading to this place is quite small and you should ideally prefer to walk instead of travelling through vehicle. Also the story behind this place is also nice to hear, this place provides you with positive vibes."
spiritual place,it s a old temple has a hot spring spitual atmosphere. also the design and structure of temple is old and beautiful.
Guru Vashisht Temple,Nice place dedicated to Guru Vashisht and Lord Rama two separate temples besides each other... Have bathing places separate for females and males having hot water.Beware of people selling so called kashmiri woolen items around at very high prices which they latter get ready to sell at throw away price too. Must visit place.
Hot water spring,"There is a nice temple and hot water springs where you can have a bath. It is considered to be therauptic. there are separate areas for men and women. There is an arrangement such that the water flows out through taps.Apart from that the view from the temple top is very beautiful. The approach road is very narrow , steep and crowded. It is a good place to visit."
Holy place,"Considered to be a holy place, the Vashisht Bath is a place thronged by locals and foreigners alike. The idea of community bathing is a bit odd for many however, one can take a holy dip in the hot waters and 'cleanse' themselves."
Nice for a visit + beware of foreigners not respecting the place,Separate holy hot water pools connected to hot springs for males and females but you would find some foreigners abusing the place by entering the pool naked
Small and Crowded,Vashisht temple is a very small temple and being a tourist attraction it is very crowded with people visiting form across the globe.  One can easily spot people continously taking pictures there and don't expect a pic without photo bombers there.Vashist Bath which is known for its sulphur springs is in the temple itself and a number of people both men and women go to enjoy the bath and relax in the water. It is also believed that these waters are very good for skin and body aches. And at the same time the bath area too is very small and filled with too many people but usually it doesn't become uncomfortable unless someone is very shy in nature.
"its very crowded, can be missed.",water hot spring is very small and dirty. water comes through a pipe. so u cant see natural phenomenon. if you have lots of time then only visit.
Hot springs in cold,This is the ancient temple of vasisht. The priest of Lord Rama kingdom. It's considered healthy and mental empowerment bathing in this hot spring water and relax
Guru Vashishth,How history has preserved this mythological place. Garam kund was blessing.this is place is located just 3-4km from main Manali market. Temple and surround scenery was very nice. very small que for darshan.
Worth a visit,"If you are in Manali, you must visit this temple enroute your trek to Jogini Falls. And if you can spare time for a warm-spring water bath in this temple, it would be therapeutic. Carry a towel and a spare pair of inner-wear though.There are different enclosures in the temple compound for bathing of males and females."
vashisht temple,vashisht baths basically having a very ancient temple of rishi vashisht  .there are hot springs where devotees can take bath seperated for both man and women.
hot bath,This is a small place with hot water spring. There are small rooms where you can enjoy hot water bath for a limited time.
A must visit in Manali,The hot water spring along with the Vasishta temple is a must visit when in Manali. The place also offers breathtaking views from the top.
Jai shri ram,Well if u miss this place in manali u miss everything hot water bath was amaizing temle and shoping area here i felt better then manali.
Average,The temple is good but i found the bath  average and small. Just make sure when you visit vashisht do not forget to  trek to the beautiful jogini falls.
Its nothing that great place,Although there are some temples to see. Its in very top location and nothing that great to see there.
Good Place,It is a nice place to visit. There are 2 temples one is of Guru Vashisht and another one is of Lord Rama. Few Kilometers of walk is required. It has Hot water Kund separate for ladies and gents.
The women's bath is disappointing ,"Compared to the men's hot spring bath, the women's bath is big let down 😕. Don't get too excited ladies. However, if it is not crowded, do try and bath to enjoy the benefits of a sulfur bath. Bring a towel to dry off.It's a cool stop on the when walking up to see Jogni waterfalls."
Hot water kund,Vasishth Ashram is having two temples one shiva temple and another Vasishth temple .The temples are made of wood.There is hot water kund in vashisth temple separate for ladies and gents. people take bath for medicinal reason.
Beat the cold,By getting into this hot spring at Vashisht temple. It can get crowded in the day so our friend asked us to get there early - and it was worth it.
Best hot spring ,"Very invigorating hot bath spring said to have originated at the place where Brahma Rishi Vashistha meditated. Laxman moved by the severe cold and snow at his guru's place, invoked the Agni arrow and shot it to the ground for a hot spring to emerge Here u can see the spot at which the Brahma Rishi meditated and the hot spring next to him. One needs to take a towel and change of clothes if intending to take a dipCan sit inside for hours Only men bath allowed here but not nude baths"
Found by chance.,"So we were off to see the vashisht temple and never had heard of the baths but eventually when we got there we saw these. People were bathing in it and everything, its like a hot spring in the middle of all the snow. It was my first time to see something like this and it was nice. The water was really hot."

Bath time,Vashisht bath is one of the most famous in manali.there was two type of kund . One is hot water kund and one is cold water kund.
How to have a perfect time in Vashist temple!,"The temple is famous for hot springs and baths inside the building. This is one place that everybody should experience at least once in Manali. Especially in the months of Sept-March when it's less crowded. The summer months host a lot of people, so I personally don't like to go to the common bath. The temple is clean and so is the bath because of running hot water from the hot springs. There is a separate bathing area for men and women. It is an excellent way of relaxing and calming the aching muscles after a long day of walking on slopes or cycling (if you're an enthusiast)! Overall, I'd say plan your day and make it exhausting. Then go to Vashist temple to relax in the evening in the summer months. ---------------------or--------------------Visit in the winter months when there's so much snow that the pipes in homes/homestays are blocked. You'll definitely find running water in Vashist temple! The hot water is also extremely pleasant. Perfect way of spending a winter morning. Haha!  Hope this helps!"
Natural Sona Bath,"Vashist Temple are located very far from the manali, attraction for Bath with natural warm water.. male and female separate bathing area defined by committe of temple.Many temples are located in the vashisht complex.. There are many markets outside the temples"

U can also have the view of snow laden mountains of Himalayas there There is market also u can do shopping there. U can buy the traditional cap starting from just 50ruppes. Also u can buy some good woolen cloths like traditional jacket starting from 350 ruppes
Unique and Hot,This is a very unique experience and place to visit with its hot water springs and bath pool. Even if you are not a religious person must visit the hot water springs for the hot experience
Something one must visit,Its one of the most iconic places to visit. But please beware that there is a steep road you need to climb. so if you are visiting with elderly people be cautious. Once you are there the Guru Vashisth Kund is a must for few minutes. It will surely give you relief from your pain.
