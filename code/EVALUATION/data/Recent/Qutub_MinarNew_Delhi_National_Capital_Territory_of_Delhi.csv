Good place to visit,"Must place to visit, one of the famous monument in South delhi, very crowded thought. Some wonderful eating joint around the monument. Would recommend this place."
Wow place Qutub minar,Great history and The¬†Qutub Minar¬†is a towering 73 meter high tower built by¬†Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in 1193...it's really wow ..Love this place ü•∞
Amazing Monument and the surroundings,Must visit if you are in Delhi to see the amazing monument . Its a design and Architecture wonder . The stairs inside the monument are closed for public visit. But you an visit and see it from a short distance . The surrounding complex is also very beautiful . Plan your visit during day time. You can reach easily by metro also.
Impressive!,"I really liked there... The place is stunning, well maintained, clean, peaceful. The minar is really impressive, I wish I could have gone to the top üòÄI had a great time exploring the ruins around this magnificent structure üèöÔ∏è"
Picnic,I went to visit this during my school times. I was too small to get the reason of ots existance but little bit i can have is the memories with friends. I enjoyed the beauty around and gathering there with school friends
Must visit historical monument ,"One of the important historical monuments in India üáÆüá≥ and one which I was waiting to see from my school days. Has an amazing history regarding the building, renovations. Interestingly this one is built after destroying some 27 hindu and Jain temples. This was built to mark the beginning of Delhi sulatanate Mode of transport - there is a bus stop right in front of the compound. however we went there by a cab as we don't understand hindi and it's easy to manage a cab driver with English. Best time to visit : winter season. We made the mistake of visiting there in May month. üò≠ Scorching heat literally kills you. Couldn't stay there for more than 10 minutes. Attraction: the complex has multiple small buildings which we didn't bother about much. We just took photograph in front of the main Minar. If its a cool climate, we can surely  go and roam around much Must -Water bottles and sun glasses. Irony - people are not allowed inside the minar as in olden days due to some freak accidents in the past And the ticket counter guys are not so well versed In English. Govt needs to take care of this. Ticket prices are cheaper online. 35rs per person. Once you come outside, you can see people thronging for something cool as the weather is too hot."
Good place,Its very good monument and this place is best for photoshoot and You can feel different here. This place is nice
Good Place for tourist,"Good Place for tourist, i think it was earlier longest building in delhi. ticket price was little expensive"
Wow,This is a must visit site in Delhi. It is an ancient site and very interesting. We loved this place.

Tower above city,Only a couple of days in the city the Qutub Minar - the minaret should be on your list. It's stunning. Best way to do it is with a guide or cultural tour. Definitely worth a visit. The view is worth it.Hint : book a guide or cultural tour. In December cold during day wear warm clothes. Bring your camera and make sure you have good footwear. take your time do not rush.
One of the highlights of Delhi,"One of the highlights of Delhi, without a doubt. If you have more than one day in the city, go here. Take the metro to Qutub Minar Metro Station and take a tuktuk from here or walk the 20 minutes along the road. The sight is not just about the minaret, but has plenty of other historical buildings and ruins. You can easily spend 3 hours here."
Great cafes,Very close to the metro station. The place around this monument had some amazing restaurants and cafes. Also has some beautiful indian clothing boutiques. The monument itself is pretty and so is the garden but the ambience of the whole place was very nice.
Majestic Tower,A 70m tall majestic tower stands upright in middle of Delhi. Built in 1190s it never fails to fascinate any visitor. It is a world heritage site and is a must visit for all those who has a keen interest in History.
An Amazing Historical Attraction,Its an amazing historical attraction in Delhi. Its Its one of the most popular monument in India. Its construction was completed by a long period by different emperors.
Tall beauty,It was beautiful and  best things about Minar is you get to see this standing tall monument more beautiful during evening
Memorable Historic Stop,Enjoyed our leisurely walk around the historical site a picture taking pictures.Llots of open area so you don't feel crowded or closed in. Spent over an hour and enjoyed people watching and being among the many families who were visiting. Would recommend allowing at least 1-2 hours for your visit.
History + Calm,"This place is so calm that you cannot say or feel that you are in chaotic Delhi. If you love history, then there is a lot for you - the ruins of many great buildings of thousand years old Delhi Sultanate, Iron Pillar which was erected by Chandragupta centuries ago (it was actually erected in 4th Century and later shifted to this location in 10th Century), Alai Darwaza, Qutub Minar, A mosque, couple of tombs, Alauddin Khilji's (Khilji Dynasty) tomb - all this you can in Qutub minar complex. Duration- all you need is 2-3 hours."
A good one to put on your list,Thank you to tuk tuk driver Sunil Peter in Delhi..find him on fb or on fb as bess tuk tuk driver This is a great stop reminding you of India's vast history. We have spent 3 years on the ground in India ... and yep if you have time make this stop.
QUTUB MINAR,i loved the Qutub Minar by aybak and his son and the creativity of aybak was good and the marbles right on top was made by his son.thank you
THE QUTUB MINAR,Qutub minar is an elegant pillar.It is one of the loftiest pillars in the world.This lofty pillar towers to a height of 242 feet.It was originally built with seven storeys.The diameter at the base is 49 feet and it gradually diminishes towards top.It shrinks to 13 feet at the top.It is built of red sandstone and white marble.
History lessons,Visit ONLY during winters.Manicured lawns and well maintained monument.Weekend witnesses a lot of rush hence avoid.
old world meets 21st century eyes and I loved it,"What a lovely place to  learn about Indian history, I was there in the afternoon light was amazing, kites flying in the sky and lots of people watching. Lovely experience."
A must visit!!,"The  called Qutub Minar Complex is certainly a destroyed Vishnu Temple.The same can be easily understood once you carefully see the architecture and the inscriptions on the walls of the complex. Although the real history of this place is never revealed fully, it doesn't take‚Ä¶"
Nice,"It was overall nice experience ,route is crowded but depends if you choose the right time you can be there without hassle.well maintained "
An iconic symbol of Delhi,"Qutub Minar is an iconic symbol of Delhi. The free standing medieval tower is very hundreds of years old and was built by a Muslim invader called Qutubuddin Aibak, after destroying the existent temples built on that site. You can see the ruins of the destroyed temples at the‚Ä¶"
outstanding,this place will take your breath away. Stunning buildings with loads of history. A real oasis in this busy city. Take lots of time to enjoy.
Heritage site,Great place. A Must visit place in Delhi. It's one of the main tourist attractions in Delhi. The art works in the wall are really beautiful. I loved this place so much. If you ever visit Delhi must take some time to visit this place. It's really amazing to see such a beautiful piece of art. A great place with lot of sceneries.
Very popular local attraction,"Our tour of the sights of old Delhi included this monument. We were there many years ago, but on our recent trip saw that it has been cleaned up quite a bit. There were lots of local people enjoying family outings and we enjoyed watching them too. As well there were various animals around the place including palm squirrels, rose-ringed parrots & black-shoulderd kites, which all made for an entertaining and colourful experience."
Site to Cover,Opens throughout the year.Entry Fee Rs.30/- and opens from 7 AM to 5 PM. Nearest metro station is Qutab Minar from where to go by auto is beneficial. Book entry ticket online to avoid the long queue in ticket counter. Leave your valuables prior to entry as the lockers are on the opposite side of the road. Beautiful structure no doubt. But not only the minar several other beautiful structures are also there. Great place to visit.
"Amazing, Kumar our travel guide had alto of knowledge on the Qutub Minar",Amazing. Kumar our travel guide has alot of knowledge on this tourist attraction.  A must see for everyone!
tallest minar,"it is the tallest minar. going inside the minar is not allowed i think , there is a beautiful garden outside the minar"
Sandstone Tower,"We visited Qutub Minar on the first day of our golden triangle tour. A sandstone tower built in the 12th century. Started in 1192. Control of India transferred from Hindus to Muslims, from Afghanistan, in 1192. This was the tower to celebrate the victory. Built in five levels. 72.5 meters tall. Interior stairway closed in 1981 when it failed and people were killed. Very interesting grounds. One of security guards gave us suggestions on where to stand for best pictures."
India Visit 2020,Visited this place as a part of our India Tour. A historical place to visit. Beautiful place Very crowded as it it is one of the most tourist attractions in Delhi.
Muslim Sandstone Tower,Modestly interesting minaret part of a series of sandstone buildings/temples along with an original iron pillar which in its day was difficult to fabricate. Good for pictures but not overly impressive compared to other attractions in India.
Historic famous place,It is one of the old and famous places in Delhi and you should definitely see it. There is visit timing and it opens at 9 am till 6 pm in summers and closes at sunset and entry ticket you can purchase online nowadays. Old architecture and greener is the best combination to spend some quality time with friends & family. As you know in old times it was allowed to go on top of qutub minar but now it is restricted. Very peaceful & calm place.
5 storey Round structure,Very peaceful place. It is the tallest  historical place in Delhi. It is a 5 storey round structure. Place is huge and the structures are awesome .Iron pillar is very famous. People were trying to put their arms around the pillar and trying to touch fingers of their both hands! E tickets are available so no need to get into long queue for tickets.Many restaurants are available nearby!
Medieval Era Marvel..,"Built by qutub-ud-din Aibek,it is one of the largest minaret in the world. Qutub minar complex consist of many small monuments such as alai minar made by Alauddin Khilji,Iron pillar of Ashokas time, Mosque quwwat ul Islam,Madarsa and much more. If you visit this place the nostalgia felling comes around you. Mehrauli archeological park is also near by where you can see various tombs,arches and some other stuffs."
5 storey minerate,"it was built by some Muslim ruler. Green lawn spread all around gives a beautiful look. It is a 5 storey round structure. There is a iron pillar in the compound, which has not rusted even after so many years"
Run-Down and Overhyped,"One of the things people would want you to see in New Delhi, is the Qutub Minaret. I was lucky enough to visit the monument with my family, and a tour group - frankly, the hype does not support the experience. I can imagine the Minar (tower) was a sight to behold in the days of the sultans, but now, you cant."
Old monument,A round five storey structure covered by red sand stone all over. Balconies are spread out on every storey. A big green ground around the monument
Intricate shone carvings,"Continuing on our guided tour of India, my wife and I visited the Qutub Minar. Looks like this place is always busy, with an equal mix of Indians and foreigners crowding around the highlight spots. I noticed lots of people were trying to take a photo of somewhere that is empty of tourists, but during the morning it proved almost impossible. This is a major Islamic construction in India built in the 12th Century AD and took about 8 years to complete. The main minaret is 73 metre high made of red sandstone and surrounded by intricately carved stone mausoleums and tombs in the complex. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it is an important historical monument. Check out the parking areas around the site for the number of Tour Coaches and you will be able to gauge how busy it is. Toilet facilities are available, but not like we are used to. The site is open every day and entry costs 600 INR for foreigners and an extra 25 INR for using a still camera. Another one of the more important historical sites to visit in New Delhi."
Lovely setting,"Very tranquil place, with lots to see. Need a guide or good book to get the best out of your visit. Not over crowed."
Impressive UNESCO site,We went to the tower as part of a City and highlights tour of Delhi and New Delhi.  You need a guide to make the most of the visit to this historic UNESCO site.  It is the oldest building in Delhi and is located in New Delhi.  The tower is located in the centre of nearby remains of a mosque and other historic buildings.  The security is high and it is well worth a visit.  I suggest you allow unto an hour and a half for your visit.
Qutub Minar,A beautiful place with lots of history. We had a guide which was really helpful.   Not a lot else to do other than walk around the buildings but a lovely area.  Will take you about an hour to get around
"Historical place, worth a visit","This is a historical place. I was there on a weekend day and it was very crowded. Very long queues to buy a ticket. But for foreigner they have a seperate ticket booth where the queue isn't too long. The fee for foreigner is much higher than for Indian. Inside it was busy, but not too crowded. Walk around and explore the places of this Unesco world heritage site. From far you can see the tower of Qutab Minar, but inside there is much more to see. Walkin around will take you one to one and a half hour."
UESCO World Heritage Site,Well worth a visit!  Helpful security guards are on hand to advise on the best place to take photographs and will take these for you for a small consideration (INR100).
Beautiful and relaxing visit,"This was one of our first sights in exploring Delhi, a fascinating history, and delightful grounds well maintained to explore. A good place for a family visit. Easy to access and we took a tuk tuk back to the metro. great fun ."
Tourism ,"Unbelievable stunning remains, definitely worth a visit. If you have only time for one site seeing visit do this one."
Amazing Place...Hard to believe it was built in 1196!,Amazing location and grounds to walk around....  Spire is amazing... Was built in 1196AD...  amazing architecture....  As heads up the security guards will offer the opportunity to shoot your photo .... for a tip..  They know the angles and the locations...... US$1 is the going price
Beautiful!,"The Qutub Minar is a beautiful sight to see! There weren't too many people and the weather was perfect. The carvings were so intricate and the complex was filled with greenery. It was a great place to take some photos and film a small video. I was disappointed to see some people climb onto the structures to take some pictures, but the guards made them come down. I would definitely come back here with my other friends when we visit because it is so amazing."
Best Iron Pillar,"I have visited Qutub Minar as called Iron Pillar with my friends. As a photographic point nice place to visit with full of history. You can take a guide as local guide is available easily and they might charge INR 300 to INR 500 and show you around the all important part. Qutub Minar easily to reach via local transport like, Bus, Metro and Uber cab. The best time during March to September you can visit early in the morning and evening.  I would differently recommend visit lovely monument."
Am amazing building,"The height of this structure and its design almost takes your breath away. An amazing visit with several other buildings but beware uniformed ""security"" personnel offering to take photos - they will do this for a tip which is usually in paper money denominations."
Holiday ,Qutub Minar is again located in South Delhi.To reach there you will have to get down at Qutub Minar metro station and then go for Autorickshaw.There you will find ample of tourist.Great place to visit alone or with friends. Loved the place.
Not to be missed.,A key piece of any Delhi itinerary and rightly so. Amazing architecture and craftsmanship. Certainly worth a visit.
Wonderful views,An interesting place to visit. Climbing up the minaret up narrow curvy stairs is difficult especially if one has to pass people on the way but the view from the top is well worth it but take care to watch where one stands. Lots of local people enjoying the peace of the large courtyard area.
You must go!,Part of my Chaman Duggal tour. Amazing historical site. I highly recommend this place! A must for your trip to Dehli!
Historic Tower of Victory,It has been told that the Qutub Minar was built to honor the military defeat of Delhi's last Hindu Kingdom at the time it was built around the 1190's.  This tower is so unique in its construction that UNESCO has designated it as a World Heritage site along with the other‚Ä¶
Excellent,"It was a wonderful monument to visit their and a very historic place ,  a very tall monument, recommend to all. "
Wonderful,"Must place to visit, one of the famous monument in South delhi, very crowded thought. Some wonderful eating joint around the monument. Would recommend this place"
Day two in Delhi. Wonderful stone carving,Beautiful ruins. Don't miss the 22 foot high iron pillar with no rust.  Not crowded and easy walking.
Amazing architecture,"The main attraction is the Tower. If you are interested in Islamic motifs and designs, this is one the finest there is. The intricate and delicate designs are just amazing. Take your time and take in the atmosphere of that place."
More than just a tall tower!,"Before going to Delhi I have to be honest I read about this tallest tower in India and thought it doesn't look that tall, probably not really worth a visit.  After visiting I came to appreciate the detailed intricate structure and it's storied construction.  The surrounding structures all also nice to see.  We did have a guide which was able to explain the history and detail."
Amazing architecture ,"India is full of incredible buildings but this one really stands out as a piece of masterful architecture. Worth going with a guide who can explain the history and significance but even if you don‚Äôt, you can still marvel at the majesty of the buildings."
Realy nice and historical,One  of the main tourist attraction in Delhi. Huge area but nicely maintained. There is a ticket of Rs. 35/- for this place to visit .~1.5 km from Qutub Minar Metro station.
An ancient monument from the Mughal era,"Its one of the oldest and most significant monument from the Mughal era. It was built in the 12 th century, and is an icon of Delhi. Located close to the airport its a must visit. Decent parking, well maintained, not too crowded."
Very impressive ,We enjoyed this site. Has been well restored and is a very impressive feel to it. Good amenities. Foreign tourists go to left window. If you pay by credit card there is a slight discount.
Historical Monument of India,I visit the place with my family and our experience was so good. The place was so clean and well maintained by the authority and staffs are also very cooperative.
Really interesting!,A really impressive monument in Delhi with interesting architecture. It is really nice to visit it and walk around the place and take some good pictures!
Lovely and quiet,Although this place is busy with tourists it has a lovely feeling.Nice ruins and lots of flowers and chipmunk running around.Worth a visit.
TOUR,"One of the finest places to hang out! The structure is something which is not to be missed if anytime you are visiting Delhi! The only thing I would suggest is, visit the place during winter because there you will not be finding any place to rest upon! So summers would be a disadvantage if you are planning in the month of jun-aug !!"
Qutub Minar with human history ,"Folks, I hope you didnt miss my reviews so much so I am back to write my another day outing. It was Shivratri vacation and a family get together. This was an long time wish to visit this great historic place and so close to my house. This monument is around 10 kms from the airport and around 20 kms from New delhi railway station. There is a nearest metro station by the name Qutub Minar on Yellow line. One can get the metro directly from New Delhi metro station. You may have to buy a ticket to enter and lockers are available to keep your luggage. You won't find anything to eat inside the monument but if you come out lots of options available. Parking is just opposite to the monument. The site is been undertaken by Archaeology survey of India they ensure to keep it clean and hygienic. You have clean washrooms to use. Hope you find this review helpful.See you with a new review soon."
More than expected!,I honestly hadn't looked much into this historical landmark aside from seeing photos of the minaret and was pleasantly surprised by the sheer amount of monuments there were to check out.  You could easily spend an hour or more hear walking around and checking out the grounds.  Well worth the 600 rupees cost for foreigners!
Family visit,Though I had visited qutab in 1998 February with two business associates yet the pleasure of visiting with family was exhilarating and despite April heat we all enjoyed the visit
Worlds tallest brick building.,"Well worth a visit but have a guide so you really appreciate the history of this wonderful place. Dating back in parts to the 9th century, it will leave you speechless."
Great history,Well worth the visit.Lots of monuments to see.There are no waiting anywhere.Short queues.Interesting history.
Qutub Minar,"must go place in New Delhi. Especially during evening time, for taking photos, it's really nice. amazing"
Beautiful piece of Indian history,A beautiful piece of history this qutub minar and it‚Äôs peripheral area has been given a facelift by government. With amazing lights if you wish to visit the monument in the evening with extended hours. A good parking space adjacent to the main monument.
Visit to a living museum of Delhi,Nicer and cleaner than ever.The place is more orderly than earlier.Parking could be better organised and hawkers removed or relocated in an orderly way
History and maintenance at its best!,"Visited this Monument for the first time. If you are interested in history, learning something new and best picture venue visit Qutub Minar!"
The wonderful Steel Minar,"Qutab Minar is one of those landmarks in Delhi, without which you can not claim that you have seen DELHI. It was started by Quitubiddin Aibak in 1200 AD and was finished by his Son-in-Law Iltumish."
Great old monument to visit,It's a must place to visit if you are travelling to Delhi for historical and munumental visit. The only reason I have rated it low is because of the polution levels in the area. If you visit than strong recommendation to use the pollution masks.
Wonders of medieval World,The iron pillar inqutub minar could not be ascertainedof its composition.It is rust free. Wonderful piece of engineering
lovely few hours,We spent a few hours wandering around and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Took some great photos and the tower is stunning.  Definitely worth a visit.
Beautiful spot,The complex grounds are really beautiful and worth a visit. A security guard even offered to take pictures of us and did a great job (we gave him a small tip).
Nice place in Delhi ,"APlace is looking so nice and beautiful in the City ,places clean and nice beautiful, architecture."
Great architecture!,"Qutub minar is a great place to visit. Easy to get to it from aerocity (near airport) in south Delhi. Buying tickets is easy, especially for non-Indians. You can walk around without a guide and get a great experience. Be firm to ward off the guides if you don‚Äôt want them. The security guards seem overly friendly to take your pictures but they will ask for money in the end, so just be aware of that (just annoying that‚Äôs all). Otherwise, the complex is a beautiful place to spend a couple of hours and get a glimpse of the rich history of Delhi. Oh, the bathrooms are at the opposite end of the complex (when you look at google maps)."
Must Visit Tourist attraction in Delhi,"One of the oldest Monument in Northern India, first Islamic Mosque was built at this place in northern India after demolition of 27 ancient Hindu & Jain Temples, All 27 temples were built in seventh century. And the tower is called the Tallest stone built victory tower,"
Interesting but very little information ,"We visited here with a private tour guide and were shown the various monuments around the park, which was nice.However, going without a guide would be really difficult as there are are very few (if any!) signs to explain what each item is."
Must see.,Tower is indescribable. Rest of the grounds is a lesson in crumbling ancient architecture.Worth your time.
Sight seeing...,We enjoyed  spending  time here .its a beautiful  and peaceful  place to explore .book your tickets  online or pay by card and get discounts  on entry.
Must to visit in Delhi,"This monument is must to visit in Delhi. It's a UNESCO World Heritage site located in Mehrauli, south new Delhi. It is 73 meter high tower of victory. A 7 m-high iron pillar¬†is also located inside the qutub premises. to know about history, please Google it."
History History,Fascinating place - our private guide was loaded with info about this tower and how it was built in several stages by different moguls and rajas.  You need a guide who speaks good English (or French or Spanish or whatever)
Really enjoyed this,I really enjoyed This! The history is a good one and the scene is stunning. One of the Security guards took some Amazing pictures of us which was a Nice surprise!
Quite an eyeful,More for those interested in history this Minaret is huge.  It was quite crowded when we visited but the Guide made it come to life.
Nice experience. ,IT'S  NOT MY FIRST TIME IN Delhi this time I was  with  my girlfriend she is  like this also people are  so friendly there food was also  very  good and Qutub minar its very nice..
Pay using phone,"Scan QR code at entrance to pay with credit card. The normal website doesn't work.Found a guide inside and he gave us a quick 30 minute tour for 200 rupees.In comparison to other precolonial Delhi monuments, this one is the most impressive in my opinion. The designs on the facades and interior are amazing. Don't miss this if you are in Delhi."
Visiting,Very good hotal and  fesility was very nice it was so amazing think you can try one time this hotal. You realized it's your sweet home....
Fascinating place,"I love history, and poking round ruins. If you are into history, there is loads to see here and it predates much of the rest of Delhi. Of more interest to serious history buffs, but still a great place to visit."
Amazed,This was not my first visit  to the qutub minar but it was probably my best visit. We need a great guide amit who was great
"Great pics, lovely afternoon ","Nice to walk round & soak up the atmosphere. Green parrots nesting in the eaves, well looked after local dogs lying in the sun. It‚Äôs nice that it‚Äôs there for people to look at."
Amazing,"One of the most popular spot of South Delhi to visit. Very nest and tidy place. Guards and staffs are very polite and helpful. If anyone is planning to visit this place then I would recommend to visit in the evening time before sunset. You will get very good lighting for Photography. You can also visit this place at night but for that you have to checkout first and get a fresh checkin to enjoy the moonlight view with artificial lighting. I highly recommend this place for Kids, Friends and Family."
we had an amazing visit,"this was not my first visit to the Qutub Minar, but it was probably my best visit. We had a great guide...Krishna...who was also great taking amazing photos. It's an amazing place. It was good to be reminded of that."
Ironnnn,"It's is very great awesome architecture made of iron, I have came such a great architecture untill now it's an awesome....... It has some small market near to it...."
Old is Gold,Qutub Minar is one of the oldest attractions of Delhi that reminds us of the glorious past of India. It has a very luxury shopping area around.
Worth it,"Big fan of monuments , so I went to this place , seriously this placs was hell amazing , big space to just chill with your loved ones and feel the air and Sunshine in any season , perfect place to spend quality time and playing some fun games."
AMAZING PLACR,"WE fast time this place visit.qutub very old and good monument,this is very nice piler and build .i would highly recommend people visit qutub minar,"
It is so crowded,"Yes, it is a very interesting monument, but by the time we visited at the end of our India tour, my wife and I were exhausted by the size of the crowds.  Of course, that is the way things are in India, but the press of people and vehicles in the Qutub Minar area is truly overwhelming.  It is one tourist attraction I could have missed and been ok about it."
Must go now,"This is one of the most beautiful times of the year.. essentially Spring and may be till early April only. If you end up being in delhi during summer vacations, then choose a 4 pm onwards slot.ticketing made easy with ministry of tourism QR code based tickets, also small discount on online payments and free for children under 15.While everyone sees the qutub minar and the iron pillar, don't miss iltutmishs tomb and khiljis tomb too"
Stop one,Awe inspiring construction and so close to lotus temple. Don't leave it out you will not be disappointed
Beautiful,It's NYC to visit here it's made of iron ...Though it's made of iron it don't have any rust on it...
such a great place,"its a really wonderful place, my guide was good and very knowledgeable. India is really incredible. Street food was an add on"
Sight seeing ,An amazing building on an historical site well worth seeing beautiful architecture well kept while their spotted two baby owls in a tree
Not to be missed!,"Delhi's Qutub Minar, at 72.5 meters or 238 feet tall, is the tallest tower in India. The red sandstone tower is surrounded by ancient medieval structure and ruins and is collectively known as Qutub Complex. Mughal art and architecture is one of my most preferred in Indian architecture, and this place with its crumbling walls has many stories to tell. This UNESCO World Heritage site is not to be missed, it was our favourite monument in Delhi!Until 1981, visitors were able to climb the 379 stairs to the top of Qutub Minar, but sadly now the interior is now closed."
Good,It's very old monument however it's area is well maintained n cleaned ...There is plenty of street food to choose ...
Iconic 12th-century sandstone minaret,"Beautiful 73-metre in height, victory tower and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Lots of structures and ancient architecture to see in the area."
My Favourite Attraction in Dehli,"This probably isn‚Äôt the most obvious attraction to visit in Dehli but it‚Äôs by far the best (in my opinion).Qutub Minar is a complex built in 1193 and boasts series of burials, 2 mosques and the best feature; a 234 foot minaret. (The minaret is 5 stories high, hand carved in red and white stone and was built so high that it was never used for its original purpose because of its height - no one explained its use to the local builders before construction commenced.)The British even added a further small tier but this was subsequently removed and placed on the lawn nearby.It really is impressive and it‚Äôs worth letting the security guards take your photo and show you where to take the best photos (for a fee of course).The juxtaposition of the minaret and the aeroplanes taking off is incredible.Add this to your list now!"
Qutab Minar,"A must- seen place in New Delhi. Although only one of the towers is still preserved, the place is very impressive"
"Nice Grounds, Interesting Ruins and Beautiful Tower",The tower is only part of the complex.  It would be worth seeing by itself.  The construction and carvings are amazing.  There are also several other ruins around the complex.  The ruins of an old Mosque makes you wonder what the place looked like in it's heyday.  The grounds are well kept as are most of the monument grounds I saw in India.Hawkers are not allowed inside the area but there are plenty of them at the entrance.  Best to get a ticket in advance to minimize exposure to them.Allocate about an hour to walk the grounds and enjoy the experience
Tallest brick minaret,This was on the list to see in Delhi before we head down to Agra. It‚Äôs a beautiful structure and we were stoked we got to see it.
Ancient victory tower,"Awesome architecture.Best to have a good guide who can explain the history of Qutub Minar, and the various parts of the remnants and the ancient craftsmanship."
Magnificent and serene,"What a magnificent array of intricate work! It was a pleasure visiting the Qutab Minar complex. The lawns and the trees added to the aura of calm majesty. One can easily spend an entire day there. Was happily psurprised to find clean loos. The only thing missing is a neat cafeteria. And, one of the graves is wrongly marked as a mosque!"
Amazing site. 240 foot tall tower completed in 1369,"This is my favorite attraction in Delhi. Allow yourself plenty of time to roam the complex and make sure you have plenty of sd card space for pictures. The enormity of the project and the math and labor that went in to this tower started in 1200 is mind boggling. The grounds are well landscaped and manicured. If you are a westerner, expect to be directed to a ""VIP"" line to get your ticket. The reality is Indian nationals pay about 50 cents to enter and you will pay about $10. You do not have the option of standing in the Indian line. Truthfully it was worth the extra money to go right in with no wait and $10 is not out of line for this site. This practice is common throughout India. You will pay a premium for being western. We should charge Indians a premium for our attractions!Back to the attraction. It is best to visit early in the morning for smaller crowds and late afternoon for the best photos. Allow yourself a couple of hours."
Nice place,"Nice place just to stop by for few minutes, it doesn't offer a whole lot but worth just to stop by for few minutes."
One Guide is a must to know the real story behind the Minar structures..,"It was good for your childrens to know the values and culture of Great  Indian History,iThe childrens above std 8 and above already studying this history in school,when they visit the place they will not forget the history"
Well worth a second visit,"We first visited this site in 2012 as part of a tour group so it was a delight to be able to return with only 3 of us plus guide and take the time to explore the many amazing facets of its buildings, history and glorious location.  It helped too that the place was not overflowing with other visitors so that we had ample time and space to wander round."
Super Top service ,Qutub monster as a very old good monument. This is very nice piler in mehroli area. Built by qutub don't Ahmed
Wonderful monument of mogul time,We had gone here multiple times. This time we went along with our feiends. Everytime it looks magnificent.
Beautiful architecture ,The architecture has been beautifully restored including the very tall  tower.   Magnificent structures.  Worth going early in the season before all the tourists turn up !
Qutab Minar visit on sunday,My family visited Qutab Minar on Sunday 2nd Feb 2020. It was very crowded but we had a nice time visiting this historic place in Delhi. If you are planning for a sightseeing in Delhi please don't make plans on sunday because every where it is very crowded.
Romantic ruin,"Interesting ruin, bought to life by guide.  Little information at the site.  Well worth a visit but read up first."
Peaceful place,We enjoyed spending time here. It's a beautiful and peaceful place to explore. Book your tickets online or pay by card and get a discount on entry!
Qutab,A long drive out of the center of Delhi but a beautifull spot and example of marvelous architecture in the past.
Too good,It was ideal weather and had a guide to explain everything.  Everyone just enjoyed this trip and you have to have at least enough time to visit this place.
Historical Marvel,"This place can be a paradise for history buffs. Whether you are a group of youngsters or a family anyone can visit this place. But just keep in mind this place can get really crowded at peak hours so in case you are not OK with it then try to head there on a weekday or just after it opens. Also it is better if you can book tickets online either from apps like Klook or from the government recognized payu website. This will help you skip the exorbitantly long queue at the ticket counter. We went there on Sunday afternoon and as expected the crowd was massive.....from locals to domestic and international tourists, many people went there. But luckily the place being huge it did not get much stuffy. It was already evening and we got some exquisite shots of the place.....though we had to deal with lots of photobombs. The main tower built by Qutub-ud-din Aibak stood tall at the centre though they don't allow tourists to climb it up. A little distant away was the unfinished minar which was started by Alauddin Khilji in an attempt to build something larger than the Qutub Minar but now lay unfinished. On the other side lay the Quwat ul Islam mosque where I don't think the devotees pray anymore. All this really transported us to the era of Delhi Sultanate when people created such marvels with limited technology.I would highly recommend people visiting Delhi to go there and take a walk through history."
This and the Crafts Museum are two must-see places!!!,"This is a fascinating, spiritual, uplifting place.  If you have a sunny day, try to go earlier in the morning, or later in the afternoon.  Don't go at midday.  The slanting light illuminates the carvings on the walls.This place is really worth seeing!"
Must see,Yet another monument that you must not miss when in Delhi. Clean and well maintained. QR code booking system advertised at the gate was not glitch free though...
Don't miss out on this Unesco world heritage whilst in Delhi,"We spent a few hours at Qutub Minar, it's the largest tower in India so you shouldn't miss out on it if you get the chance to go to Delhi. Entrance for foreigners is 500 Rupees (not even 7 EUR.)"
Historic discovery,The minar may be the primary attraction and sure sticks out loud and clear but its worth exploring the entire area around that has hidden gems of colossal historic value. Its literally like an adventure to suddenly find a small monument among the thick undergrowth. I have been told that  sometimes people find old coins too though I have never found any. But its more than a photo op its an experience. Advisory: go there in a group as its safer.
Its just like the leaning tower of Pisa,This monument was amazing to view up close.  The grounds are easily accessible and well presented. Lots of other monuments to see and well signposted.
Amazing architecture ,"On our first day in India, we visited this complex, with the main focus being the Qutab Minar, begun In 1193 and completed in 1368, a symbol/tower of victory over the last Hindu kingdom. What an amazing piece of architecture and to think when it was built - staggering! It remains as the highest tower in India, 73 m high (239 feet). At the foot of the tower is the first mosque to be built in India."
"Night view of Qutub Minar is amazing, I loved it",I went to Qutub Minar in the month of Nov2019 at night around 7 PM. The view during that time was amazing and the lighting effect is superb. It was looking very beautiful as the sky was very clear and the moonlight was amazing.
Nice art,I visit qutub Minar with my friends in month of January. This is very huge very built before 500 years. It's very nice place for visit nearby area is forest area so looks very green.
qutub minar visit,"during our visit in rajasthan we came to delhi to visit qutub minar.it was a plesant stay and we enjoy qutub minar,and the food beside that."
Family day,Good place to have your young children have a trip to this historic place and enjoy. Place have good facilities
Historical monument,"Good monument architecture view, better to visit in winter's or summers , nearby qutub institutional area you can go for Maggi and other eateries"
"The most prominent monument in Delhi that is a ""Never Miss""!!","Every time one travels to Mehrauli in the southern periphery of Delhi that leads one to Gurugram, this tower (minar) is a Never Miss. It is quite a sight from far off but one needs to get close to get a good view of the architecture. The Iron Pillar in the complex, the remnants of the Jain temples and the entire vast complex is a sight to see to believe how awesome it is."
Great Monument & surrounding,"Very well maintained monument, easy to locate with parking facilities and eating options , good for children of any age"
Beautiful ancient structures,You can get up close and personal with structures hundreds of years old. Get taxi rate in advance and stick to it.
Very special interesting highlight of Delhi ,"A very interesting complex with the 72 meters high tower in the middle . The highest tower in the world built of bricks . 2 first floors built in the 12 century and the 3 floors on top in the 15 century. 379 steps staircase, closed to the public . Tower built in Hindu Islamic architecture. Many Arabic and Muslim motives in the complex . Another tower klai tower was not accomplished. Entrance 9 USDLRS."
Qutub Minar,"Very beautiful place to visit, neat and clean premises, many historic structures, night view is amazing, visit at night too. If you enter 5 o'clock you can see both views."
Impressive monument of Indian history,Impressive monument of Indian history marking a start of new era in Indian rulers. Line for tickets were quite long but I was orient and did not buy the express tickets. Carry cash as Eftpos machines don‚Äôt work very well. Will take 30 mins to visit the site.
Pushkar jain,It is historical place a tower made by Kuubdin Abak in 12th century. Also oldest masjid named kuwatual islam maszid and iron pillar from Samrat Ashok
Interesting spot,Interesting site with a lot of ancient remains. Well laid out and easy to walk around. The carving on the walls are well preserved. Well worth an hour or two to visit
Sight seeing ,Full of historical information regarding the founding of Delhi. Well maintained and clean. Part of the ancient Mughal history of India.
One of the best places in New Delhi. ,"Qutab Minar is one of the most beautiful places in Delhi. You can come here by yellow metro line. Also you can use uber, ola or tuktuk. Enterance is not free. You have to pay. But it‚Äôs not too much. For foreigner tourists getting ticket is more easy. Also you can book your ticket on line."
Historic place,Amazing to see workmanship and beautiful architecture 500 yrs old. Mind boggling iron pillar. Pricy for non indian
Mesmerising place to visit,Incredible ancient and beautiful buildings on this site in Delhi. Definitely worth a visit. The tower is particularly stunning and decorated with amazing carvings. Lots of nice photo opportunities.
Worth a visit,The guide was determined to demonstrate that the builders who used the old stones from an earlier temple did not obliterate all the statues.  Facinating.
Day visit,"We got the Metro to Qutb minar and walked from the station, it is a very interesting site with lots of information available and opportunity for great photos. The minuret itself is amazing.Well worth the visit."
Fascinating historical site,"The Qutub Minar is a ""must see"" highlight of Delhi to go and marvel at how something so colossal was constructed using the technology of hundreds of years ago. Built largely from the remains of demolished temples of other faiths, the Qutub complex is today just a shell of its former structure (other than the Minor itself) but is still a fascinating view. Be sure to see the Iron Pillar there as well, a mysterious obelisk over 1600 years old that's another trophy of war brought to grace the Mughal capital. There's plenty of good historical signage there for a self guided tour or a guide may be worth it depending on your interest level."
Qutub Minar ,"A remarkable monument that historically cast a shadow on future invasions of India.  Be that as it may,  it also initiates the growth of a cosmopolitan nation that India is today."
amazing ancient moghul ruins,"Always read about Qutub Minar, so it did not disappoint when we were finally able to see it in person."
A very interesting place. ,Visited here and was impressed with what the place contained. It has a lot of history attached to it. I would recommend visiting here.
Beautiful Park,Well worth wandering around and exploring this park and it's incredible ruins for 600 rupees a small cost.
Must see,This was my first site to visit since I was in South Delhi and it is close by. Beautiful and interesting place. Tip: Foriegners line is very short and to left of others in line.
Impressive! Must see in Delhi,"This site is truly impressive, an incredible example of early Indo-Islamic architechture! It is one of the Unesco World heritage that you should not miss in delhi. It houses the tallest brick minaret in the World (72.5m)."
Qutub Minar memories üíê,The visit to the monument was very nostalgic and memorable . The architectural details of Qutub minar and the detailing on the stonework is something not to be missed . A winter evening was Great and the picture of the same while lit from a restaurant was so beautiful sharing with you üëáüèºWhen in Delhi do not miss the opportunity .
so beautiful!,"The beautiful sandstone carving here is a human wonder. A great place for photos as the carved stone is very photogenic, not to mention the cute squirrels!"
Nice location,Although been here many times but the first time i visited this place with kids and they loved it. The architecture is fascinating and the location is prime. Had a sub just outside at a local subway after. Overall a good place for a day out.
Expensive for tourists,"The minaret which is the main attraction is closed to visitors. Nothing much remains around that worth the 600 INR foreigners' fee.You could take a picture with the minaret in the background nd that'll do, in my opinion."
A soaring tower,"It takes an hour or so to get here from town, more if you get caught in the traffic. Built in the 12th century this is another architectural marvel in Delhi and is a Unesco World Heritage site. The tower itself soars 73m and is really worth getting close to see the structure up close and personal. There is more than just this tower in the grounds. With landscape grounds and wide open spaces it is worth exploring. There are other structures and to make the most of your visit and more importantly be able to see everything it is worth getting a guide. The tower may be centre of all attention but is surrounded by several great historical monuments.  These include the Iron Pillar which is in the courtyard of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, On the outside is the Alai Darwaza, in a far corner away from everything is the Tomb of Iltutmish which few visitors seem to get to, then there is Alai Minar which looks like a half built fort situated at the far end with nothing surrounding it. Enjoy and take lots of selfies and photos .. everyone else will be doing just that."
Beautiful Architecture ,We enjoyed the afternoon when our amazing driver Kehar dropped us off for 2 hours to enjoy these monuments.Many conversations were had with locals and we photographed many pics here!
Qutub minar,Great place to walk around. Private walk was wonderful. Be warry of street guides. Take enough water though
Fascinating,Interesting historical site with some well preserved ruins and interesting history. Wild chipmunks and an array of parrots added to the atmosphere.
"A great place to visit, lot of history to learn",Clean place to visit with a lot of descriptions and history about Muslin history in India. The picture taking opportunities are great.
EXCELLENT HISTORY,I'm into history and this place is superb .. also enjoyed the historic street traders nearby (selling old coins)
An astounding architectural site - must visit,"Containing the substantial ruins of the oldest surviving mosque of India, as well as gorgeous and striking tower (the 12th century Qutab Minar)- this is a must-visit site for any tourist in Delhi. It can get busy on holidays - queues for non-Indian citizens are shorter, however (the tickets are more expensive). The metro stop is at some distance from the entrance - you will need to take an auto-rickshaw."
intersting site,Intersting site well worth the visit.  Well cared for and protected.I need to add 36 more letters to this review
amazing place!,"This historic, world-heritage site was built in the 1200s. Among the amazing buildings is the world's tallest brick minaret. It is fabulous. I'm only sorry we didn't have more time to explore this site."
The tallest sandstone minaret in the world since 1192,"We visited the tallest brick minaret in the world, which is also A UNESCO World Heritage Site in ND.  It is 73 m-high tower of Muslim victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak.  The tower is the highest tower in India. We arrived one hour before sunset, it was the perfect time for a misty and mysterious setting. We enjoyed this site.  It is Worth the visitSEE photos."
Incredibly Inspiring Tower,Amazing Stone carving both in the tower itself and the surrounding buildings ..... beautifully preserved with some very interesting photo opportunities framing the tower inside various arches of the surrounds.... often quite crowded ...but always worth a visit...new token system for getting in ...make sure you hang onto it to get out a separate exit
Good to visit ,This place is simply marvellous. Very beautiful and historic place. Many things to see inside. Perfect example of ancient architecture. Recommended to visit with authorized tour guide. You will enjoy more by knowing history related to each and every part of the place.
Tall and proud ,Beautiful old minaret. Lovely carvings and impressive history. Sure it offers great views from the top. But one cannot climb up.
Fascinating ,We visited in the late afternoon when the sun made the tower a rich red colour.  Lots of architectural interest and the intricacy of the carving on the pillars constructed from the ruined Hindu and Jain temples was stunning.  A must see place in Delhi
very very nice plac,is was great excrescence to delhi side seen all tha place is very very nice  my frinds mr ram klaha ji is amazing guys the will help us
ARCHITECTURE,"It‚Äôs a must place to visit,,classic architecture,huge area of plan to spend few hours of walking around.I don‚Äôt know much about architecture but we felt it‚Äôs better than Tajmahal."
Must visit,One of the best monuments of Delhi which is a must visit for every person in India and anyone who does comes from outside
The view ,"I must said that it was impress what the muggles has done, but the tower for security purpose is amazing, the height the design and the colors... maybe they had not think it that way... Best time to visit over the sunset"
Great walk around ,We spent a lovely hour or so walking around the well kept grounds. Once comprised a site of hindu temples then converted into an Islamic complex. Remnants of both remain making for a very interesting experience.
AMAZING,"Utterly beautiful and rich with varied history, favorite site we went to in New Delhi, should not miss"
Must Visit,This site was one of my favorite places in Delhi. An impressive structure with abundant photo-taking opportunities. Put this at the top of your list.
Tour,One of the best monument in Delhi. It is really awesome. Best for photoshoot and hangout with friends.
Well worth a visit‚Äîa guide would help here,"This Indio-Islam tomb site is huge and somewhat informative.  More information would be helpful or having a guide would have been great on this instance.  Even so, we learned quite a bit about the site and it‚Äôs age (12th century) site sets it apart.  Well worth a visit and there is plenty of security so we felt safe even though we went without a guide.  Security wanted to do selfies which we refused‚Äîwe never give up the phone‚Äînot sure if there was any ulterior motive or they were just being helpful and promoting the site?"
EPIC !!,What a place is this !!The imagination of the creator of Qutub Minar is totally different. Built to superbly a standalone structure standing still even after centuries just as it was. This is really superb !!For travellers there is a big parking space just opposite to the entrance.For Indian nationals the entry is INR 40 and for Foreign nationals it is about INR 550.One can spend about 2 hours to gaze and understand this monument.Entry is available untill 10pm but should one wish to enter the Minar structure the entry closes by 5pm.
Interesting historical sight,"Lovely park and historic buildings. Well worth a visit. Remember to find the Neem tree with 200 medicinal properties ( so they say!) beware the security guards offering to take pictures. They will set up well, just be aware they expect a tip."
Good one,Well it was amazing to visit this place after a long wait..So it's was amazing though but my stay in amigos made it twice‚ò∫Ô∏è.... Hostel amigosindia it's the nearest backpacker hostel to qutub minar
Beautiful lighting ! Don‚Äôt miss. ,Do find time to visit the monument ! The lighting is beautiful and the monuments and it‚Äôs surrounding is kept very clean ! The signages can be improved.
Great monument,A lot of history is here. Came here with my family for the weekend really enjoyed the scenic beauty and loved the historic monument
Towering Qutub Minar Ancient Ruins,"Enjoyed our short trip to Qutub Minar. Love the ancient ruins here, similar to that of Rome and Athens. Some lovely shots to take in the compound."
Excellent Place a must see in New Delhi,One of the best and amazing places to visit in New Delhi.Really Impressive and great Architecture.Reminds you of the old times.
Amazing Archeticture,"Definitely worth the visit. There are other structures to visit behind and in the back of the Minar. There are tombs on the grounds, interesting."
Pretty good historical place ,"This historical place is really impressive. As you can see in the pictures, the architecture is amazing. Tip: there is a line for foreigners in the ticket office, which is faster than the other ones."
Qutub Minar,"Upon arrival it was not what I expected. The area was very busy and the process to get inside the grounds wasn‚Äôt straight forward. Saying that, we queued in the foreigners line, bought our tickets and headed to the security area and entrance. Once in the grounds we felt safe and were able to wander around and enjoy the sights. There were benches dotted around so we could sit back and absorb our surroundings. As with all tourist attractions you are hounded as soon as you leave by tut tut drivers! Still, it is a worthwhile destination whilst in Delhi."
Magnificent monument,Easy access. Magnificent historical monument. Excellent cultural reminiscence. Guide not required. Must visit.
Outing,Nice location. For photoshot and perfect nature and historical view and understanding.Worth and lovely
It's a good starting point to see a city,Very interesting reuse of stones from Hindu temples to build a display of Islamic domination over destroyed culture
Better in sunshine,It was pouring yesterday when we visited.  Nevertheless the tower is impressive and the story around it fascinating.  Notice the faceless Hindu carvings making the columns of the Muslim temple.
Must visit,A must visit place if you r in Delhi. Buy tikit online not costly. May take 2 hrs or more to explore the place
Good ,Nice I have work but visit this place  in between  to that place so it's quite and nice for evening view
Abundant cultural visit,"This place has such an amazing history, it really is a must do while in Delhi so you can begin to appreciate the depth of history it has to offer. Unfortunately high entry price charged to foreigners."
"Great visit, close to airport!","Great place to visit in South Delhi, about 2 hours is all you need and lots of great pictures!  I would recommend fitting into your itinerary!"
My visit to the Qutub Minar- Beautiful Historical & iconic tourist destination of India in New Delhi,I is one of the most popular tourist destination. It is a historical monument build by Mughal Emperor and is a very masterpiece of excellent architecture. The entry ticket to the monument is very nominal. Food Kiosks outside the monument offer yummy food at very reasonable prices. There are many gates & other historical buildings within this venue which are worth watching. A spectacular sight for all people who love to visit the historical places.
Stunning to see.,In our trip to New Delhi this was my favourite spot. The architecture is gorgeous and it is a photographers dream. I would recommend that anyone staying in Delhi get out and see this site. It is worth paying a guide to get some of the history of the site as there are lots of little details that you might miss.
Beautiful Place,"This place is a bit far from the centre of New Delhi, but worth a visit.It's a beautiful place to visit."
Alai minar,Excellent visit good history very helpful security staff ensuring we had the best experience and places to take photos
Superb,I surprise how this minar still alive because our guide told us it's built before 500 years. You can imagine how that time they build such a huge minar without machinery.
Historical Religion place,"The place showing the religion phases of ancient India. However, the 72 meter tower is one of the miracle at that time, as we can also see the tolerance of religion diversity in India"
"Qutub Minar, A Historical Minar","Its situated at Mehrauli. Yellow Line (qutub minar station). The best place for history lovers. Apart Minar, you can see ruins, iron laat. nearby place you can visit mehrauli market, garden of 5 senses, phoolwalon ke sair venue and enjoy traditional food also."
A beautiful monument in the heart of the city,"So I recently planned a to qutub minar on a public holiday. This monuments is so surreal and beautiful, surrounded by a lush green park. It's a perfect place for a mini picnic with family."
Must visit if you around in Delhi,It was recreational plus educational trip. Very good place. Worth seeing and spending quality time at this historical place.
Photos,We had great times there and enjoy that old building and amazing area catched me to offer the other friends
So Much History,"The stone structures, the history; a compelling site. It takes time to walk around and see it all. Very much enjoyed."
Awesome place,It is one of the best architecture of that period.qutub minar is clearly the evidence of our rich architecture.A must visit place
Really worth the trip,This is a Beautiful place. Definitely Worth a visit. Most impressive site in Delhi although super busy
Amazing experience,"I had never heard of this before but it was included in an Urban Adventurers tour. I was in awe of this massive tower, it‚Äôs age and history. Well worth the visit."
Wanted to put an Indian flag on top of the tower ,"I always to see this place since I was a kid. Nice place to visit clean and easy to spend couple of hours. Line took a while as system was down amd then they ran out of tokens. Reading history of the place made me sad that Hindu amd Jain temples destroyed to make this place. But then I reflected how great country India is that despite this they have allowed this structure to be preserved however in other countries they would have destroyed places like this ie. Pakistan, etc. I wish there was a big Indian flag on top of the tower .. or somewhere in the vicinity as the history of it and how the people built it was disrespectful to Hindus and Jains by destroying their place of worship and using the materials disrespectfully to create this place."
Average Place,Average place if you are willing to see the length of tower. Old archaeological stuffs with written itinerary about Qutubs
qutub tower,Very nice to see. Clean place. We had a good guide who explained the history. Interesting. If you visit Delhi it‚Äôs worth to come here
Qutub Minar and archeological park,Thank you Sair co. For a great tour.  Our guide Thanu was very knowledgeable about the time period that Qutub Minar was built. She was a lovely person who we would like to take a tour with her again.
A busy day in Delhi,Tallest ancient tower but on day we went it was a public holiday so huge crowds. Still worth a visit to climb and look over Delhi.
To be seen ,A place where to go ! Very interesting with a lot of things to be seen - very good for nice shooting - sometimes very crowded
The sculptures are beautiful!,"I enjoyed my visit there because of the beautiful sculptures, many many on the roof, on the surfaces of historical remains. Some of them kept in good condition and not so many people there so you may walk and see slowly. Recommended as a half day outdoor sightseeing trip."
An interesting monument but not spectacular ,This was a nice first stop on our tour of Delhi but if you‚Äôre short on time then it isn‚Äôt mind blowing.The history behind it is good and it‚Äôs very impressive to see.We had a tour guide with us which was helpful as he explained the history of the site.
Victory tomb!,"Was intrigued by the monument, and the near by unfinished Khilji monument, where in the ruler tried to match if not beat this structure. Also tells of the plunder of local temples and the purpose of the monument to showcase a battle victory."
The tallest brick minaret in the world,"Had visited this historic minaret in New Delhi a long back ago. This minaret is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists.This minaret is located inside the Qutub complex. It was built by Qutubuddin Aibak in 1193 to celebrate the Muslim dominance in Delhi. The architectural style of this 73 metre high minaret is Indo-Islamic. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This minaret is a famous landmark in Delhi. It was opened to the public long ago. But due to a stampede, it was closed to the public in 1981. It is the highest tower in India, complete with 5 storeys and projecting balconies. Inside the Qutub complex, one can visit the ruins of Quwwat ul Islam Mosque, Iron Pillar, Tomb of Iltutmish, Alai Darwaza and Alai Minar. One has to pay an entrance fee to visit this place. There are vendors selling lemon juice outside the Qutub complex. Had admired the ruins, the Iron Pillar as well as the Qutub Minar as a school going child.This minaret is an ideal place for families, history lovers as well as architectural buffs. It is a must visit place and should not be missed when in New Delhi."
Memorable Experience at Qutub Complex.,"Qutub Complex is not only the World Heritage Site of India its also should be known one of the best architecture monument with different century attractions.Its most important attraction with a great architecture.The complex having not only 12 century minar but also having Iron Pillar date back to 4th Century and the first Islamic School ""Madrasa"". Same complex having one of the oldest mosque of India ""Quaat-ul-islam masjid with Alai Minar & Alai Darwaja. Also having a sundial in the garden and Smith Folly , one more beautiful architecture building ""Tomb""."
Unexpectedly beautiful,The Qutub minar took us by surprise as we were not expecting it to be so big and have surrounding buildings as well. The architecture and the rich history it has is very interesting. It is a hidden gem
Awesome,"Ahhh the memories, went there after 17 years. Great to see that it's being maintained so well. Loeved being back there after so long. Although now, it really is a task to get inside owning to so many people visiting place but it is well worth it once you're inside.Beautiful."
absolutely Amazing,we arrived mid afternoon and there was so much to see that we were still there at sunset.Our guide also knew the exact spot to stand to get the very best photos. highly recommend visiting this wonder.
A must!,Went to see it again after nearly 20 years. What a change. It is really worth seeing it. Impressing ruins in a well kept place.
240 ft World Heritage Site,Its a part of Qutub Complex. Minar was built as Victory Tower for Mohammad Ghori over Prithviraj Chauhan and marks start of Muslim rule over India in 1192. Complex was built on a temple site. Iron pillar is one of the major attraction in complex.
Absolutely brilliant ,A must visit site to see the detailed craftsmanship. It is a must see and you will be genuinely impressed.
Beautiful tower and ruins,"Due to the protests in Delhi, Qutub Minar was the only major sight my family was able to see and it did not disappoint. Most of the site was in ruins, but I enjoyed seeing the intricate details in the stone craving and the tower was marvelous to see in person. At first I ignored the tour guide asking for business near the entrance, but I was glad I hired him because he knew all the right places and angles for taking amazing photos. We went to Agra, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chittor, and Udaipur afterwards, but my wife considered this to be the most memorable place after Taj Mahal."
Amazing Architecture,Beautiful Architecture and the facts our guide told us were astonishing. Loved visiting it. Thanks to Target Tours India for adding this into our itinerary. I was not keen on visiting this but Glad I did.
Holidays,Nice beauty and elegance nature to have a perfect photoshoot with good view of historical view to see nice india
Historical monument,Went to see qutub minar with family and kids. Nice tourist attraction. Half day trip can be done here. Photographs were good here
Beautiful monument,It was a beautiful historic monument being maintained by ASI.Better to book it online from ASI website as we have waited for around 2hours due to  the server outage.
Fascinating momument.,Fascinating monument and surrounding gardens in Delhi. Very well maintained and helpful security staff who pointed out the best spots for photos.
Amazing Early Mosque,"Incredible historic mosque with minaret's and other very early muslim ruins.  It's quite a hot place to visit so take lots of water and a hat.  There are good notices in English at most of the points so that you can read up on the history.  I had a great guide that not only explained the history but also knew where to take the best photo's from,"
One the great Historic monuments,"Beautiful place to visit in early morning hours as it's not crowded much at that hour, you can learn and enjoy the scenic beauty at your own leisure. the monument is surrounded by greenery all around, there are also ala ud din khilji's alai minar and his tomb, tomb of iltutmish"
History of early Muslim India,"Though it is no longer possible to climb the tower, many points of interest can be found in this complex. For instance, guides can show you where idols from 27 Hindu and Jain temples here have been turned upside down and used in building the walls of the Muslim invaders."
A historic monument worth exploring,"Worth a visit when in Delhi and exploring the heritage structure in the city. Indian nationals and foreigners have different queues for purchasing tickets at the entrance. Remember to retain the token given as it needs to be returned back on exit. The experience inside is quite nice, plenty of greenery around, reasonably clean wash rooms and the monuments / points of interest are well explained in Hindi and English. You'd require about 2 hours inside to explore it comfortably. If you're taking a tuktuk / auto rickshaw from outside the venue, remember to bargain the cost before sitting (cardinal rule for rickshaws in Delhi)"
Fascinating,"Loved our visit here as part of our golden triangle tour, such amazing monuments with intricate stone work"
Glory from the Mughal Past,"The Qutub Minar and the adjacent structures, some partly completed represent an era or Mughal rule in India, making Delhi their center. The architecture is marvelous and worth adoring. The complex includes the inbuilt minar replica double the diameter of the original and tombs of some emperors like Iltumish. Must visit site if in Delhi"
A glance at the past ingenious engineering,A wonderful structure standing. It a shame nowadays one is not allowed to visit inside. Beautiful other structures stand around Qutub Minar.dating the period. Some of them in ruins and weathering.
Beautiful and majestic,One of our favourite experiences in Delhi.  It's such a feat of engineering - it seems impossible that it's nearly 1000 years old.
Fantasic,"As this was my 1st time visiting India, I was taking to visit with one of my friends. once you had gotten past the ticket buying and security searches, the place itself is lovely & tranquil with ancient ruins & peaceful gardens. I spent roughly 2 to 3 hours here.If you enjoy a piece of indian history I thoroughly recommend this place to visit due to the history of Qutub Minar & the tranquility to escape from the traffic outside.Highly recommended"
Monument of Medieval Times,"Minar is one of the first monument of medieval period when Muslims established their rule in India. ASI has turned this into a visiting site and to begin with it is a must visit, though not useful in any way it shows it magnificence by being a tall structure. Iron pillar within the compond is marvellous."
An interesting and historically significant landmark of the city.,"Probably the most famous structure in the whole complex is this tower, the Qutub Minar. The tower was built by Muhammad Ghori, the first Sultan of the Mamluk Dynastry that established the Delhi Sultanate. It commemorates his victory over Prithviraj Chauhan, one that marked the first of the Islamic dynasties that ruled over the subcontinent.It kind of looks like a giant juice extractor with it‚Äôs protruding edges that project out from the tower, which from far off gives the look of the tower an interesting texture. An interesting and historically significant landmark of the city."
historic pillar,Truly amazing- is the word when you view it. Its hard to believe that its a 12th century monument!!! another aspect worth noting that after qutubuddin aibak altimush and shershah also built the higher storeys. there are other structures in the complex and they are also beautiful though some have been reduced to ruins.
Nice place.,A nice place to hang around and watch the beauty of the structure walking around the lawns. Can get crowded at times.
Beautiful and highly recommend visiting. It‚Äôs the tallest pillar in India!,Beautiful and the tallest pillar in India and you can see the base of construction for what what‚Äôve been an even bigger pillar. The architecture and design is stunning.
Review,Qutub Minor is a great monument of construction. Nice place to visit in Delhi. Climate in winter is too chill.
Stunning ,Awesome. Ankush from BAE TRAVELS provided lots of historical facts. I was fascinated. Very informative and he knows soo much history of all the places we visited.
Interesting but not majestic ,Nice place to see but the first of Jaipur and Agra are far more spectacular to view. It is close to New Delhi so it‚Äôs convenient to see.
World heritage site,"The adage goes, whoever wants to write history, it destroys history to be remembered. As bad as it goes, it is true. The minaret was destroyed and taken over back and forth by Hindu, then Muslims, etc. Since they believe in different images, the minaret and nearby structures were constructed in different designs. I think it is 176 meters tall, one of the tallest. Yes it costs to get in."
awesome experience,"the experience was very good. loved the ambience, just a bit maintenance issues are there.the site is full of historical memories, good for people who love to study their past"
Wonderful,I visited Qutub Minar with my friend. No words to say totally wondering.Every one must visit this place.
impressive building!,–ê place full of history. Definitely worth a visit! I advise you not to forget to put on a hat and take a telephoto lens to the camera in order to shoot amazing small architectural details
A must to visit ,"My second time in Delhi and second time at qutab minar,is a must to see if you around Delhi for few days go on morning better for less crowd"
Great tourist spot,This is best place to explore our history...It would be great to look these once in life...It will surely enrich your historical information..
Qutub Minar,Historic place of old Persian architecture by mugal emperors. the main attraction is qutub minar tower. we can find there is an attempt of on more Minar construction . unfortunately it was not completed . Rs. 40 for entrance fee and the authorities well maintaining the complex Must Visit
Great monument with less crowd.,I went to see qutub minar along with other monuments in delhi during our travel plans. We went during a weekday and it was less crowded. Easy and quick public transport is available near the qutub minar. Better to go during morning or evening and avoid the sun and crowd. Nice place to hangout. We took lots of pictures as it was quite picturesque
Fun day in good weather,"Historic place w some of the oldest architectural monuments in Delhi.  Learnt a lot about the history, the minaret itself was fascinating design up close. definitely worth the visit even if it was primarily because of protests in old Delhi that day."
Impressive Architecture,"Really amazing architecture, a mix of Hindu and Islamic styles, quite beautiful.  Well worth the visit."
Amazing Historic Complex,"Historic complex filled with amazing architecture and space to wander about.The¬†Qutub Minar, is a¬†minaret¬†that forms part of the¬†Qutb complex, a¬†UNESCO¬†World Heritage Site¬†in the¬†Mehrauli¬†area of¬†Delhi,¬†India. Qutb Minar is a 239.5 feet tall tapering tower of five stories, with a 47 foot base diameter, reducing to 2.7 9 feet at the top of the peak.¬†It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.Qutb Minar was established along with¬†Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque¬†around 1192 by¬†Qutb-ud-din Aibak, first ruler of the¬†Delhi Sultanate. The mosque complex is one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent. The minaret is named after¬†Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a Sufi saint. Its ground storey was built over the ruins of the¬†Lal Kot, the citadel of¬†Dhillika. Aibak's successor¬†Iltutmish¬†added three more stories.Beautiful historic complex that is well preserved, worth a trip to explore and experience."
"Excellent tour of historical, architectural and religious site","Visited late morning.  Wide variety of architectural examples from multiple centuries and religions.  Large number of school visitors, but the site is large enough so that it did not feel crowded."
Tax on Non Muslims a real turn off,"This was a recommended 'must see', so we went with an open mind. This started to sour when we were charged 30 rupees each for someone to stack our shoes in a pile outside the entrance - I noticed most people carried their shoes in their hands. However we went with it. After walking around we decided it would be great to go up the tower to take in an overview of the surrounding area. It was advertised as 50rp each, which we felt was ok. When we came to pay we were asked for 200rp. We pointed out te sign, and the fact that those in front of us were charged 50rp each, only to be told it was because we weren't Indian. I said that felt a bit racist, but my wife was Indian, to which he replied she's not Muslim! We walked away. Imagine the outcry if that was applied in the UK!"
Beautiful monument,The qutub minar is marvelous its structured in red sand stone and it's very beautiful.One will get ancient vibe of the place and nice to take photos.
Excellent visit,I visited it among my day tour of Delhi. It is fascinating with its architectural design. The only problem there was very dirty WC that you will never use.
"The normal price is 35rp, but as a foreigner you‚Äôll pay 600rp","I feel the ‚Äúforeigner tax‚Äù is a bit exaggerated here, as India is full of of much more impressive things to see where you‚Äôre not treated as a walking ATM."
Qutub Minar in Winters,Awsome Place during Winters. Now they have opened it for Evening Light Shows also. Looks spectacular when the Lights are on in evenings. Best to stroll along in winter evenings.There is a hidden Archaeological Site just behind Qutub Minar with a Nice Baoli - Step Well. A haunted place is also der inside the campus for a fun VIsit - Jamali Kamali.
Sight and history,Good to see the quality of work by King Chauhan and failure by Akbar side by side. The tower is still standing straight. Very good to visit but donot fall prey to tauts
Top 5 New Delhi places,Good place to start to see New Delhi. Really impressive medieval architecture. Crowdy on Sundays but for foreigners there is separate que (common solution in India) with 10x more expensive tickets (around 500 Indian Rupias). Best to go by cab or tuk tuk. Good to have 1 hour to see it. There are some trees so even on hot days is not bad to go there.
Great monument,Qutub Minar was such a great experience! Beautiful and well preserved site to visit with so much history.
A historic visit,Visited this on some holiday and it was really crowded. The main minar is worth seeing. The surroundings give a pretty fair idea of history though a bit more of description wouldn't have hurt. The washrooms r there but because of the crowd they were very dirty and unhygienic. Good to visit on a winter afternoon.
Absolutely beautiful!,"Tallest brick minaret in the world. you must praise the beautiful monument and the surrounding. ""Qutb Complex"" includes: Iron Pillar of Delhi, Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Alai Darwaza, the Tomb of Iltutmish, Alai Minar, Ala-ud-din's Madrasa and Tomb, the Tomb of Imam Zamin, Major Smith's Cupola and Sanderson's Sundial."
Historical Place,Best historical Place in Delhi. we loved it and very easy to visit this place. but entry ticket is chargeable there. it s normal Ticket. best Historical place .
Good but watch for security guard photos,Great monument with plenty of photo spots. You'll be approached by security guards who know all the best spots but are hungry for huge tips.
Delhi‚Äôs best Attraction ‚ô•Ô∏è,One of a Kind ‚òùÔ∏èüå∏ A must visit Delhi Attraction...you will surely praise the beautiful historical monument and surrounding.In winters would suggest to visit in morning explore the place with lovely sun ‚òÄÔ∏è up .Ticket Price for Adult Rs.40 cash and Rs.35 by card .Reaching this place is easy from Qutub Minar Metro Station can take a sharing auto Rs.20 pp.You can get street food option outside around.Photography is allowed inside.A family and friends place it is.
Heritage,Nice heritage resort to see the nice view of building as historical imp.Good outing and nice view to have photoshoos
Better than leaning tower in Italy,Constructed in old times with perfection in architecture and design. A 5 storey round structure.It is much better than the leaning tower in Italy. I felt very ashamed that our country is not able to attract tourism even though our art and culture is far better than other developed countries.
Awesome garden and historical place,"When you visit this, it seems to be visiting an era. A monument close to 1000 years old. The hight and the work on stones is amazing. Salute to the art of that time."
Pollution ,The pollution during the time i visited is the only reason i rated this a 4. Overall a place filled with historical and cultural density with architectural designs and i did find a lot squirrels.
"Amazing architecture, more than just a pillar","I arrived at this site on the HoHo bus and was really impressed once inside the site. Took a little while to get through the crowd, but well worth the small effort. The buildings are impressive. I couldn't get over the age and condition of the buildings, you can wander all in amongst them I am still impressed."
Lovely!,I came here with my friends. Enjoyed a lot! A must visit place. Do come with your friends & family. Especially the archeological park was astonishing.
