Nice Japanese air self defense display,Nice display about the Japanese air self defense planes Post WW2. Good for families with young kids.
Great Storyof JASDF Aviation,"I visited this museum and was impressed by the number of items on display.  They had airplanes in the hangers where you could actually sit in the cockpit.  There were flight simulators for kids.The museum had a small gift shop.  There was also Key Coffee which is small beverage and snack shop in the museum.Best of all, the museum is free and parking is free.One thing to note is that almost all of the exhibits had explanations in Japanese only.  A few had english translations, so you have to really like aviation if you come to this museum and can't read Japanese.Near the end, I saw a sign saying where to return your audio guide.  But I never saw an area where you could get one.  If you come here you may need to ask the staff where to get it.An impressive museum and a good way to spend and hour or two."
A Nice Facility for Public Relations of Air Self-Defense Force,"This facility is widely open for many people in free of charge.Both of kids and adults should have great times there.I bet those who are interested in aircraft, defensing activities can enjoy a lot.The exhibitions are great to see. Weapons such as missiles are displayed together with reasonable explanations. You can get into the cockpits of exhibited airplanes which had flied in the air before. This may bring you the memorial photos.Souvenir store offers great variety of air force goods, towels, shirts and so forth."
"Several aircraft, weapons, simulator, and dress up as a pilot","The air park is free. It is amazing with kids, but also good fun as an adult.Lots of interesting things to see: There is a variety of fighter jets, search and rescue and training plains exhibited. You can dress up as a pilot and takes photos.There is a great simulator where you can practice take off, fight, and landing. For this you have to book a slot because it takes about 10 minutes and it is extremely popular. Best tactic is to go there, book your slot, explore the hangar, and then go there on time.There are lots of additional displays and info on the work of the Defense Forces: rescue and peacekeeping operations overviews, what the role of the defense forces is, how the different kinds of aircraft support each other and ground forces, etc.Many interesting weapons systems, radar systems, and other cool equipment can be viewed too.There is also a simplified simulator for kids. Both are fun.Most info is in Japanese, so having an audio guide or a good translation app (like the instant translator of google) is very practical.Photography is allowed everywhere.It is next to a real air base so you can sometimes see the current jets and helicopters coming and going, the staff training.Getting there: you can do it by bus or cab. Former takes longer but is cheap, latter is quick but costs a bit more.There is a cafe and restaurant, plus a gift shop packed with cute items and nice models for those who love aircraft.Great fun, we had a lovely time there!"
Slightly disappointing,"Don't be put off by other people's comments - this place can easily be reached by public bus for a fare of around 500 yen each way on bus number 51.  The bus trip takes about 20 minutes, and then you just walk 50m to the first corner, turn left, walk for about 15 minutes on this street until it ends in a T intersection and then you will see the Air Park right in front of you.  The entrance is about 200m to the left when you come to the T intersection.  The very helpful staff at the Hammamatsu tourist info will tell you all about it if you drop in.  That's located in the JR Railway station.The park itself was a bit disappointing for me.  We went first to the museum part and only then did we find the display hangar (which was much better).  All the simulator rides were booked out by 10am, so really it was a long trip for not much.  My husband is an aircraft nerd, and he enjoyed it.  I personally thought the Shinkansen museum in Nagoya was better."
Good place ,We can get to see varieties of aircrafts ...its  good to take your kids there and ride an aeroplane.....you can also take pictures with the soldiers uniform there
Fighter jets everywhere.,"The Hamamatsu airpark located north-west of Hamamatsu city is part of the Japan Self Defence Force facility. It is an active air force base so you will see jet trainers and helicopters in action while you visit this museum. The museum is located in an old hanger but has been modernised with static displays, models, videos, posters in one part of the building. When you walk into another part of the building, you will see an amazing collection of jet fighters from the Vampire, the Sabre, the Starfighter as well as Japan's own design jet fighters and many more aircraft including helicopters. This hall is absolutely amazing by the scope of the display and the fact that you can jump into a cockpit and pretend you are in Topgun. There is a fighter simulator which is fun with a closing canopy and controls like in a fighter but really simplified. The museum portion is over three levels with the third floor containing a cafe, library and more displays, At the ground floor entry is located a gift shop. The great thing about this attraction is that it is free however a cab ride is essential to get there. The price of a cab ride to and from Hamamatsu station should be between 2000 and 3000 yen. Finding a cab near the airpark is hard. Walk due east from the main gate to the airpark and you will come across a small shopping mall and there is a cab rank. Worth visiting if you love planes and aviation."
Good for an air(craft) Park,No direct bus ride to the place you need to walk a bit but then its free . The are quite a few static aircraft on display which is nice . The best part is you can rent a pilot costume and actually go and sit in cockpit of a fighter plane !!. Get your pictures clicked . Helpful staff . Over-all good experince.
Take the time to see it,"It took some time to take the bus and then walk to this museum, and then to get back to Hamamatsu City, but it was well worth it to learn about the history and aircraft of the modern Self-Defense Force.  Apart from the modern planes, there are also two classic planes, an Italian biplane and a WWII Zero fighter.  You don't need to go through a checkpoint, and you can actually get a good view of the airbase."
A recommended sightseeing place,"If you go to Hamamatsu, you should visit this facility.The facility is admission free and you can see a variety of aircraft.There're some warplanes that you can sit on the pilot's seats.The facility is equipped with flight simulators available for free.You have to pick up a numbered ticket, if you want to ride the movable flight simulator.Moreover you can borrow a military uniform for free.They have not only adult size but also kid size.This facility is where we can enjoy without spending money!"
Can't Get Enough,"What an Air Park. Firstly, it free! The static plane display is awesome. Visitors get to sit in the cockpits of various fighter jets and there's also a simulator for you to fly a plane. One can rent for free pilot overalls and helmet for picture shoots. From kids to adults, male and female....there's nothing one will not enjoy about this place. During our visit, at the start (right facing) of the JASDF airport runway...and from a distance, Mount Fuji was in clear view. What a special treat. Highly Recommended."
Fantastic!!,Best place to go if you come to Hamamatsu.The Aircraft show hear are amazing. They allow you to sit in the cockpit of some jet fighter.
Locked out,Following the reviews of the Air Park we made our way their by public transport. It was quite an effort dealing with the bus system and then trying to negotiate the walk from the bus stop to the Air Park in the absence of any signs in English. Upon arriving there we found the place closed because it always closes on the last Tuesday of the month as well as from Tuesday to Thursday in certain months of the year etc etc. If the Park is really on your agenda I would suggest that you contact  them before going out in  case it is the wrong time of the year.
Good but difficult to access,"We visited here on Silver weekend so it was super busy. Entrance was free and the exhibits were very modern and well presented.  It was done very professionally.  There's a lot of fighters, historic aircraft, flight simulators and helicopters,  a shop and a restaurant.  The building itself is a fine example of modern architecture. You don't have to be an enthusiast to appreciate the exhibits.  My only gripe was that we had to use a taxi to get there and back to our hotel as public transport is extremely difficult - the area is almost rural."
Ver Nice,Good place to visit. Lot information in english. U can dress up like a pilot for free and take pictures with he vest. Can get inside of a cockpit also.
Excellent,Lots of displays and not crowded.  You can even get to seat in the pilot seat of some aircrafts.  Excellent photo opportunity.  FREE!  Good for family with children.
"""Up Close to JETS!!""","I would love to fly a fighter Jet. At this place you get to at least sit in the cock pit, AWESOME!! Good place to see some history & dream a little."
Impressive !,"We were awed by the planes, jets, helicopters & ammunition on display. My son felt really special when he wore the flight suit that came with child size helmets. He was too little to go into the real flight simulator, but we had fun posing and taking photos in front of the jets."
Great fun for both adults and children,Great experience of all the various types of jet planes. It was not just fun for the children but also for all the adults. We were allowed to try the simulator plane and wear the uniform with no cost at all even though there was no entrance fee.  Worth the stop at this Air Park.
Hours of fun for boys,"If your kids are into planes or technology then this is hours of fun for them, from seeing the real aircraft and being able to sit in a fighter jet, or a full simulator (if you are tall enough, suitable for older kids or adults), to the models and interactive information and videos to watching the real formation flyers take off as you grab a bite to eat."
Hamamatsu Air Base,Great option for those who want to know a bit of Japanese aviation.And you can wach an movie on a 180 degree cinema.
hidden gem in Hamamastu,"i had so much for here and i dont even really like plans much. its free entry, people there are so helpful and stored our bags. you get to wear fun suits and take pix in the planes! get there before 4pm when it closes. it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Free Air Museum in Hamamatsu,Do you like planes? The free museum has a massive collection of them that you can view free of charge. Look to your heart's content
Usually Not My Kind of Thing,"The equivalent to an Air Force, this Civil Air Defense base has many fighter jets and radar planes coming and going. The attached museum was a pleasant surprise. There are audio headsets available in English to help explain the exhibits, as most the written captions are in Japanese. It's a well constructed, modern, spotlessly clean place and interesting. The highlight is to walk into the adjoining hangar full of various airplanes, including WWII zeros. You can even put on a pilot jumpsuit and helmet (both are optional) and jump into several of the planes to have your picture taken. The staff in this room were quite enthusiastic and made sure I knew exactly which planes had been made in America. I quite enjoyed this small museum and can recommend it."
